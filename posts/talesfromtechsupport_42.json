        "text": "This was maybe 1998 and I was doing Level 1 support for a company that built Unix backup software, and also robotic backup tape libraries. The call came in, end of shift, Friday night.  I was young, new, and on the rise in the organization. \n\nThe tape library, which had two tape drives and 40 tape capacity, when combined with our backup software, had a feature so you could configure two virtual libraries, and assign one tape drive each, to two different hosts respectively, and divide the tape storage slots between the hosts to keep everything separate. \n\nThe customer had cabled up the library to two hosts to use the feature, and was having trouble getting the tapes to load into the drives, and back up data.   We went around in a confusing series of seemingly inconsistent tests, trying to load and unload tapes to the drives using the library's front panel menu and everything seemed to work fine.  Load tape 1 to drive 1. No problem.  But tape loading seemed to fail when using our software...\n\nI telnet in to the host to investigate.  God, to think telnet was open to logins over the internet in those days.  Quaint, isn't it?\n\nOn the Unix host, I issue some operating system commands to write some data, tar, dd, and everything worked.  Customer is able to move tapes using front panel screens of the library, and when they do that, my OS commands work fine. And, I can do some tape moves within our software, but don't quite take full notice one key anomaly:  The tapes are loading to the wrong drive when I use the backup software to load tapes to the drive.\n\nWithin our software, the backup jobs would appear to stall after loading a tape.  No data written.  Go to other host.  Same tests--bypassing our software, things worked fine.  Using our backup software, jobs appear to hang after loading a tape.\n\nI'm confused, and escalate.  The 2nd level tech gets confused after repeating my tests.  Engineering gets called. In typical engineering fashion, insists it must be something buggy with the host tape drive, tape driver, or more likely, that I must have fucked something up, he gets pissed, finally logs in and does the same tests I did, throws up his hands and admits defeat, all the while being a jerk.\n\nThe customer has now spent hours on the phone and babysitting the machines.  They are kinda pissed.  The customer was a big telecom and considered backup failures to be a high criticality event requiring immediate and ongoing effort until solved.  So management puts me on the first plane out to investigate.  Maybe the first business trip of my life and not the last one that ruins a weekend.  \n\nOnce on site, I walk over to the two hosts and library, and start running through the library install check list, which starts with cable setup.  I immediately notice the problem.\n\nSo, to run two virtual libraries, it takes 4 cables.  We used serial cables to issue robotic commands for loading and moving tapes, and SCSI cables to move data.   Host 1 should get Serial 1 and SCSI 1 cables connected to it to use Drive 1.  Host 2 should get Serial 2 and SCSI 2 to use Drive 2.  Makes perfect sense.\n\nAnd of course the problem was that two of the cables were crossed!\n\nSerial 1 went to Host 2!  Serial 2 went to Host 1.  ARRRGHHHHH\n\nSo, using the library screen to move tapes to the correct drive worked fine (as it bypasses the host serial bus), and data could be written as expected on that host, but when using our software to issue robotic commands, we were sending them to the unexpected host over the crossed serial connection.\n\nThis was one of those early career lessons that was very valuable and saved me many, many hours in my career:  Start with cabling and physical connections when troubleshooting.  I can't tell you how many times I've found issues quickly because of that lesson. Whether it was PC troubleshooting, networking, electronics, the physical layer has to be right...\n\nAlso, paying attention to little anomalies you notice, which can be hard because of pressure, multiple people communicating, distractions, multiple confusing test results, etc.  Documenting and systematizing tests and results may have given me a better clue and I might have thought to ask the on site customer to check the cabling.  As a junior tech, the more senior techs probably should have guided me to be better about documenting. As my experience grew I always tried to do that and help L1 techs to be organized and systematic.\n\nTL;DR  Robotic tape library gets confused when connected to two hosts and two of four cables are crossed.  Site visit solves it in 3 minutes.\n\n\n",

        "text": "This just happened this week. \n\nThe week between Christmas and New Year I'm off-ish. That is, I don't go into the shop, but I'm around and available if you need me. Mrs Conroy did. She had an \"old black Singer\" she'd like to drop off for service. I set up a time to meet her, and based on her quavery old-lady voice, offered to meet her in the parking lot and carry it up for her. She declined. Lots of sewing folks have dolly bags with wheels, so I didn't think much of it.\n\nAs has been true for most of the country, it's been brutally cold here in the Great White North-the daily highs have been in the low single digits. (This morning it was -25.) This fact will become important.\n\nI got to the shop ahead of Mrs Conroy and got everything turned on and looking like I was open for business. Right on time the elevator dinged, and she came into the shop carrying a battered Singer 66 over her arm. As she gingerly set it down on the triage table a piece fell off and Mrs Conroy quietly said something in profane French under her breath.\n\nMe: Er... What happened?\n\nLong story short, the machine had been sitting outside, in the unheated garage for a week or so, waiting to be loaded into the car. It's just a machine, no case, so when Mrs Conroy picked it up with her bare hands it was so cold it burned and she reflexively let go of it. It hit the concrete floor on a corner and then tipped over on its side.\n\nThe corner was broken off the bed-that was the piece that fell off when she put it down-but the bed was cracked all the way through at an angle, nearly to the pillar. The front of the head, that had likely hit the ground next, looked like it had tried to shatter but didn't quite come all the way apart. The cone bearing underneath the bed on the landing corner had sheared off at the bracket it goes through.\n\nTo Mrs Conroy's credit, she recognized that the machine was beyond my saving. She did ask if it could be welded (no; old cast iron does NOT like to be welded) but knew it was pretty much a lost cause. Fortunately, this was a thrift shop find and not sentimentally important, so she was fairly philosophical about it being junked. \n\nI've seen some damage, but that one takes the cake for 'worst', definitely!",

        "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nLTL;FTP and so on. This is a story of self-support, so I hope the mods will be lenient with this one. A few words to me, I study a few hundred km away from home \"Information Systems for Public Administration\", sth unique for Germany, where they try to get more people into IT and Public Administration at the same time. Alas, my English might not be on par with other tales, please point out glaring mistakes. You never stop learning :)\n\nThis tale is from last week's Friday, but we start on Thursday, actually. I was in my apartment in the city where I study and tried to access my NAS which is at my parent's place. It wouldn't be a tfts tale if that would work, would it? I knew my dad had planned to switch ISPs from big ol' T to a local one offering FTTH, but I didn't know when exactly this would happen, as that talk was over 6 months ago. Now let's fast forward to Friday where I travelled home for the holidays to my parent's place. When I arrived, they were both at work so I was the only one in the house. Confused I notice that my smartphone connects to the Wi-Fi, but I don't have access to the Internet. I look upstairs, and the router is in place just like I know it. I remember the ISP talk, they must have switched a few days ago. But why was the old router still in use? Turns out my dad placed the new router elsewhere, but didn't remove the old one. This explained my Wi-Fi problem, the old router still broadcasted now more or less useless SSIDs, and I didn't know the new name or password for the new SSID.\n\nI booted up my notebook to get some information via cable, grabbing the IP of the router so I know at least the model I need to deal with. Surprise, it wouldn't be a tale for tfts..you get the idea. I didn't get any connection via cable. I was more confused than ever. After some digging around, I found the sheet of paper where my dad had written down the SSID and password for it, as well as the router password. Finally in the network, I tried to ping my NAS and Raspberry Pi, but they didn't reply. I looked through the router settings and knew shortly after the reason nothing worked anymore. Turns out, the old provider's default subnet is 192.168.2.x/24, whereas the new router uses 192.168.178.x/24 as default subnet. With a 24 bit subnet mask they of course couldn't communicate, as I gave my servers static IPs. Because my dad has no idea of networking (thankfully enough he is \"standard\" computer literate, so I only have to support weird/complicated things), he of course didn't change that.\n\nI decommissioned the old router and put it out of service, changed the default subnet to 192.168.2.x/24, and thought everything would be fine now.\n\nHow foolish I was.\n\nWi-Fi devices were now able to interact. But any device connected via cable still gave no response. Intrigued, I looked through the settings thoroughly, but found no clues. After nothing worked (including desperate `netsh int ip reset` and similar techniques... you may see how desperate i was) I searched our house for the router. My dad and I talked a few months ago about locations that would be beneficial, so at the third location I finally spot the new router. On the top of the solid big closet in the living room I reached my goal. I went and looked at the ports, but of course the cables were so short that I almost couldn't move the device at all. With my new phone as mirror (frontcamera enabled) and my old phone as flashlight, I tried to find clues. \n\nCan you guess the solution to the riddle?\n\nOnly one cable was connected, and that went to the optical fiber converter, and the fiber went behind and to the side of the closet into the basement. But that was the only port in use. My dad forgot to attach another cable and connect it to one of the power line adapters so the rest of the network could access the router, not only Wi-Fi devices. I looked through my equipment, but found no cable that was long enough. I needed to buy one the next day. Plugged the acquired new cable into the adapter on the wall and the router. Magic happened, and my devices responded again.\n\nTL;DR: A cable from the ISP is enough to distribute network via cable at home /s\n\nGranted, my dad didn't make much use of my NAS except for monthly backups, so he didn't notice that as he is only on the Wi-Fi network. But I thought this made a good tfts tale too :)",

While that is happening, you can read my story.\n\nWe got notice from our parent company that we needed to install a Mobile Device Management (MDM) app before the end of the year. This gave us less than 4 weeks to configure and install the app along with getting policy changes submitted and signed. I had a user, we’ll call her “Cheryl”, come to my desk to assist. As I’m installing the application (which I’ve been troubleshooting for 30min now) I noticed an exchange account was bugging us for a password. This account was for Cheryl’s previous employer which just happens to be a competitor of ours. I asked if we can remove it since she no longer works there and she agreed. We finish installing the app and I send her on her merry way. No more than 5 minutes goes by when she walks back and asks, “Um…where did all my contacts go?”\n\nWhat??\n\nI look through her phone settings and everything is setup, the MDM is syncing email and contacts correctly but she assures me that she had over 1000 contacts in her phone. She only had 34. The only change was deleting her old exchange account. \n\nUh oh….\n\nI calmly ask if she has any backups. She told me that iCloud should do that. We check iCloud with no luck. She doesn’t back up locally to her computer either and thought iCloud “just did everything!” I didn’t have the heart to tell her that her contacts were tied to her previous company’s account and that the data is lost. (There is no way they will enable her account, remember we are a competitor.) A co-worker had an idea to see if we can import her old .pst file into outlook and pull it from there. That computer was at her house. Cheryl left white as a ghost and I felt awful for removing all that data. I know it wasn’t my fault but the damage was done and I felt responsible. I thought all hope was lost until Cheryl called me back saying that her Verizon Cloud account had all 1316 contacts backed up! \n\nWhat??\n\nI remote into her computer and sure enough, there they all are. I export the contacts and upload it to her *personal* email account so this same thing doesn’t happen later down the road if she decides to leave the company. She also emailed my CTO, CIO, VP of IT Sales, and VP of IT Services about this incident and blamed the MDM software. Needless to say, I had some explaining to do. It all worked out in the end but my God, my heart sank. This is the first time that “bloatware” from a phone carrier saved my ass. Who would of thought.",

Over the past couple years I have been entertaining people with my stories about Jack, the Worst End User and other fun crazy times in the world of IT. I have gotten a lot of great feedback from people who tell me that my utter destruction of Jack made them feel happy in their tummies, and that the story of Miss Jones warmed their hearts.\n\nMost often, though, I got responses from people encouraging me to write more and publish some of these stories. Finally, I have ability to say that I've taken that advice and I'm taking my first step toward that goal.\n\nMy collection of short tales, \"[The Worst End User and Other Stories](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078PMK32J)\" is available now on Amazon in both [kindle](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078PMK32J) and [paperback](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1976753945) form. This book features all of my submissions to TFTS (Newly edited and formatted) as well as a new short story I've never posted here. The profits from this novel are a stepping stone toward finally giving up the IT life and becoming a writer full-time, so please take a look and consider buying a copy.\n\nI want to thank you all for your support.

        "text": "Good evening,\n\nI used to work first line support for a fairly small company.  A call comes through, the sales team upstairs has a new printer.  It faxes, scans, prints and users connect to it directly over the network, pretty much the lifeblood of their operation.  Seeing as we mostly use 5-10 year old inkjet printers, this thing is regarded as being rather nice and very expensive.  We have an identical unit in the IT department.\n\nBeing the work placement kid, one of my jobs is to deal with printers.  It takes two of us (half the permanent IT team) most of the morning but we get this thing up and running.  Test print, IP address check, all good.  We head downstairs for a cup of tea.  Within 30 minutes, the phone rings.  Sales team, the printer isn't working, they're very unhappy.\n\nAlrighty then.  Time to put on a brave face and head into no man's land.\n\nThe printer itself seems fine except for the IP address, now reading 0.0.0.0.  Bit of a concern, that.  Before we go scampering off to the patch cabinet to see if anybody's been up to a spot of rewiring, we decide to check the most obvious stuff.  The stuff that can't possibly, POSSIBLY be the problem.  Bingo.\n\nI walk back to the sales office, hands behind back.  I ask, calmly, in the face of mounting anger:\n\n\"Who was the last person to open a new pack of paper?\"\n\nLike the last scene of Invasion of the Body Snatchers, all eyes point silently to one corner of the office.  One of the sales team has a decidedly hunted look about them.  So we have the suspect and the location, now we just need to identify the implement to complete the accusation.\n\n\"You know how those packs of paper are bound with plastic wraps?\"\n\nNod.\n\n\"You cut one open with scissors, right?\"\n\nAgain, nod.  \n\nI hold up two halves of a network cable.  Thankfully, people seem to see the funny side which defuses the situation a bit.  I am asked if we have another.  I tell them no, they're a strange proprietary cable which is only issued by the supplier, they cost £10 and take a week to ship.  However, I'll see if the IT manager minds me just bringing up the one from the IT printer because we haven't, to anybody's knowledge, sent a fax in the past 12 months.\n\nBack downstairs for a fresh cuppa.\n",

A few days ago I realized that the world sure has changed.  \n\nI had gotten my 12 y/o daughter a drawing tablet for her computer, as she had gotten seriously into digital painting, but using a mouse, which was entirely unacceptable to me.  I expected her to bring her school-supplied $FruitPaperbackBreathablegaseousmixture but instead she had this weird laptop/netbook thing running $TransparentGlassPane 8.1, with a 20GB hard drive, and 2GB of RAM.  \n\nThe first thing I noticed was the OS constantly popping up notices about \"low disk space.\"  A little investigation determined there was about 500k (not a typo) free space left on the already-tiny hdd.  A little more investigation determined that a certain video game was using 12GB of hard drive space.  I got permission to uninstall it and the warnings went away.  \n\nI plugged the tablet into an available USB port and waited for the OS to recognize it and do something with it.  Well, it recognized that it was *something* but had no idea what to do with it.  So, I open up a web browser to manually download drivers.  The company website is down, presumably killed by everyone trying to download drivers for their new drawing tablets.  Refresh, refresh, refresh.  Eventually it responded and drivers were downloaded.  \n\nDriver installation said it required a dot-NET runtime to be installed, so I said \"sure\" and let it go.  *30 minutes later*, the progress bar *finally* reaches 100% and driver installation wraps up.  \"Please Reboot.\"  Alright, that's somewhat expected.  I finally decrypt how to reboot the machine through the inscrutable UI in this version of the OS.  Shutting Down, spinny thing, and then a blue screen with a message that nearly made my heart stop:  \n\n&gt; *Installing Update 1 of 96*  \n\nThat's not a *good* message to see right now.  I tell my daughter that it might be a while.  That was an understatement.  Nearly 2-1/2 *hours* later, the machine finally rebooted.  And of course, started \"Finishing up\" the updates.  Fortunately that \"only\" took about 15 minutes.  \n\nAll-in-all it took over three hours to get the drawing tablet to be recognized and functional on this weird lappytoppy thingie.  My (very patient) daughter loved it and spent the next 3 hours doodling and sketching in her painting program before it was bedtime.  \n\nAnd I looked longingly at the unopened 24-pack of AA batteries I had sitting on the counter.",

Our location does no calls and thank god for that! So I mostly do chats and sometimes e-mails if i have to and the chat is going slowly.\n\n\nSo a couple of days ago I had a customer in my chat who had gotten a new SIM-card about 3 weeks ago. On the same day she restarted her mobile phone for the first after getting the new card and couldnt enter her PIN. So I ask her if she is using her new PIN and she is. I compare the PUK and the SIM-cardnumber she has and the we have in the system. \n\n\n&gt; **Me**: So how many tries do you have left to enter your PIN?\n\n\n&gt; **Her**: Oh, I only get blocked for 30 seconds and can enter the PIN again.\n\n\nI am baffled and start thinking, if I really want to ask this question but I do.\n\n\n&gt; **Me**: Are you entering you PIN into your displaylock?\n\n\nSo here comes the kicker. We can see what the other person is writing before they send the text, so we can react faster and give better support. And she is writing \"I am 24 and doing my masters\". I am thinking to myself \"fuck me another one of those\", as she removes the text.\n\n\n&gt; **Her**: ....\n\n\n&gt; **Her**: I have got a question, why am I not asked for the PIN when I restart the mobile phone, but YOU probably dont know that either.\n\n\nI am laughing my ass off at this point btw. Thank god I am not doing calls.\n\n\n&gt; **Me**: With newer mobile phones you have the option in your settings to deactivate entering the PIN, when you start your phone.\n\n\n&gt; **Her**: I am sorry for wasting your time. I hope the next person will have an actual problem, that you have to solve :)\n\nEDIT: words",

Great! can you grab the other cable, and pull the **other** end, it's probably not connected into the computer.\n\n&gt; $Client: Sure, I got it? do I need to plug it into the computer?\n\n&gt; $Me: Yes, go ahead, I'll be on the line.\n\n&gt; $Client: *noises indicate back of PC was a bit tricky to get to* Can I put the phone down for a second? It's hard to get behind there.\n\n&gt; $Me: Sure, take your time! (we charge in 15 minute frames for anything over 5 minutes: 5+min = 15, 15+min = 30, and so on).\n\n15 minutes pass, call now on almost 25 minute and going, I keep hearing client trying to get behind PC and plug USB (sometimes they have other devices filling the 2 ports in the front so I thought, whatever).\n\n&gt; $Client: Hello? You still there? yeah, I can't seem to find ANY port that fits this cable, it's just too small.\n\n&gt; $Me: What do you mean? It's a standard USB, there should be 6 ports in the back and 2 in the front that take that cable, Have you tried flipping it the other way?\n\n&gt; $Client: YES! it just doesn't fit. I don't know what to do, it was working yesterday, it must have been plugged into something.\n\n&gt; $Me: *Has light bulb above head* Hmm, wait a minute, did you unplug the cable that was in the printer and tried to connect that one?\n\n&gt; $Client: No..... ^^yes\n\n$Me: *hit's mute button, proceeds to bang head on table... un-hit mute button*\n\n&gt; $Me: Oh no, remember, I said, pull the other end. Just plug that one back in the printer and the other end should fit in the computer easily. *dies internally*\n\n&gt; $Client: Oooooh, I'm so silly, so sorry... YES! IT WORKS NOW! THANK YOU SO MUCH! Happy New Year byebye!\n\n&gt; $Me: Same to you! Bye now! *click... proceeds to bang head on table again*\n\nClient was trying to connect Mini Type-B 2.0 in Type-A 2.0..... Happy New Year folks, hope I don't have any more stories for you until next year! And hang in there, it's almost over.\n\nEdit: Formatting",

        "text": "This has literally happend yesterday. I was visiting my grandparents, as I always do once a week to go grocery shopping with them and make sure they are alright. My grandma is fine, but my grandpa is suffering from dementia and it is taking a toll on everyone.\n\nSo we go for the shopping and my grandma wants to go to the bank afterwards to pay for medical bills and such via paper transaction. You know, the ones you fill out with a pen and put in a little bin at the bank. Sounds ancient? That's why the bank decided to change things and removed their bin for these little paper pieces. She is promptly told that she can \"comfortly do all of these transactions at home on her computer\".\n\nI should note that she was a teacher in her professional life and never used a computer ever. When there was a formal letter to be written, she did so using a typewriter. Now I had the task to teach my 80 years old grandma how to use the computer. It had not been used much since my grandpa forgot how to - he used to be the one doing all the techy stuff in the household, but is now incapable of even using a light switch.\n\nSo we get to it: phototan registration, a smartphone app, login, how to set up a transaction, I explain all the steps in a calm and slow pace, and my grandma takes notes. She's happy that I show her how to do this new \"computer stuff\" and wants to try it later.\n\nLater comes around and I get a call from her. She can't manage to get to the page.\nI had set a shortcut on the desktop for her and all of that, so I assumed the internet was out or something the likes. It turns out she could not get to the page because she did not know how to use the mouse. Rookie mistake I made assuming the use of a mouse would be natural to someone.\n\nSo I gave my grandma some homework: Playing solitary to train mouse usage. ",

        "text": "Poor, poor $Bassist. Normally, Dead Week is. But the ticket gods are fickle bastards, and they've been piqued this year.  \n$Bassist and $LawnGnome are in charge of the office this week. $BlazeIT and I are nominally on-call for anything urgent needing a visit in our respective districts. The rest are on holiday, and just as well. We didn't get the great white middle finger like our northeastern folks did, but it's the coldest it's been all year. (I can tell because the cat is doing his best imitation of a balaclava.)  \nTuesday, we were completely closed because of the way the days fell this year; actual vs. observed. Most of our client base apparently doesn't work that way, because we got a flood of tickets. Mostly routine stuff, barring a couple of accidental lockouts and last-minute terminations. And a lovely one I recognized immediately and jumped on.  \n&gt;**Client:** We can receive emails internally, but not externally?  \n\nYep, MX records were gone. But this time it wasn't because someone let the domain expire. After pinging the boss and $Savacli I got on the line with $NoDaddy, and their explanation was that because that domain was set up with a \"workspace(?)\", the email auto-reverted to being hosted by them instead of Microsoft.  \nI'm still not sure if I completely believe that, but whatever. Fix the records and keep the ticket open for follow-up when we get back.  \n\nYesterday I keep up with $Bassist via text as he and $LawnGnome are near drowning in tickets. He asks me to take a look at a client machine with some odd user accounts on it and we manage to shut down someone trying to brute-force their way in.  \n*(Sidebar: all our servers are locked down , but people are resistant to change, non-profits are reluctant to spend, and up until this year RDP was a reasonable tradeoff for remote access. We finally have the political capital to push back and tell them we're shutting RDP down first thing next year, so they gotta pony up for something we can effing lock down. /rant)*  \nMidday I catch up on new ticket notifications - not tier 1 anymore, but old habits die hard. Among the usual \"monitor not working\"(spoiler: dude moved his stuff to a standing desk and a cable came loose) and new hardware tickets was this gem.  \n&gt;**Subject:** We have an active fire in the building  \nPlease tell me our backups are up to date!  \n\nThank God and Code42 they are. $Bassist texted me the title. I told him he'd earned a cheesecake later. Working on that now actually.  \n\ntl;dr *On the day after Christmas my helpdesk gave to me*  \n*A new TFTS story*",

        "text": "Been a while, new job new stories, 'good' times all around. We have 3 characters with speaking roles and a really really good set of hands for this. They will be marked by:\n$Manager - The office manager.\n$ITO - ITOverlord\n$Local - The local 'IT Guy'\n$Hands - The silent hero of this story. \n\nSo, quick background, I work for a company that handles IT for most offices in a single industry. There is sometimes data sensitive enough for there to be legal enforcement of it, so we are veeery careful on how we do our network and server setups. We have standardized equipment, IP schemes, naming processes etc. Very very meticulous and enforced for good reason. We have multiple levels of techs with varying skills (ranging from basic entry level IT work, to handling 20+ offices for a single company and having personal knowledge of terminal servers and etc. for those specific offices). My role mostly involves managing our internal portal, creating programs and utilities for employees/management, and being tagged in when something is juuust below 'Level 3' clearance to make sure it really needs to hit that high.  With all that in place lets begin!\n\nDay starts as usual, clock in, sit at the desk with coffee and start browsing feature request tickets. Someone wants to be able to view as much sensitive and restricted data as possible from home, someone wants a literal 'do my job' button, someone wants their login background to be pink. Usual stuff.\n\n I'm just about to get back to work on \"Big Project\" when I get a call. Huh, weird I didn't know my phone was on? Oh, internal call. Drats. Well, I answer get a spiel from a tech working with an office. Its a common problem, office can't access their server from any workstation, but the tech says the setup is weird. Names seem wrong, mapped paths are weird... Yep, that's leaning towards level 3 and escalation territory. I get the ticket info, and start 'the process'\n\n&gt;$ITO: \"Hey, this is $ITO from 'Company' I see you have a ticket in regardi-\"\n\n\n&gt;$Manager: \"Yeah the office is down, no one can access anything, we need this fixed, now! We have $Local on site to do whatever you need to get this done.\"\n\nAlright, well that's a fun start. I get put into contact with $Local, get to hear his opinion on how much of a ripoff we are, but get him to consent to let me remote into hardware as needed. \n\nNow for where it gets 'weird' according to the other tech. I open our server monitoring system, see that the offices server is online. Brilliant! Start up a remote session, start poking around, and lo and behold! Fully connected to the network! Pings run fine from it to other devices, pings run fine from other devices to it! I'm scratching my head a bit wondering what the problem is and then get hit with a sense of foreboding. Check the D: drive... empty. The file structure we set up is there, but every folder is empty. \n\nI take in a deep breath and start mentally prepping my data loss speech, hoping they have a good Backup when I hear on the headset...\n\n&gt;$Local: \"Look it's obvious you don't know what you are doing, I don't even know why you are poking around on that machine, we don't use it, your hardware is crap.\"\n\n\n&gt;$ITO: \"You... don't use it? So you have another server the office has been using?\"\n\n\n&gt;$Local: \"Duh, I told $Manager your machine was crap and then built one for the office myself. Look, I've got actual work to do so I'm going to give the phone to $Hands, she can help you with whatever, but when you can't fix it, just tell $Manager.\"\n\nWhite Box device being used as an office server, setup with 0 knowledge of our processes by a non 'Company' person... Yep. Level 3 weird alright. I start to prep one of our level 3s and run through a few checks to get info for them. \n\nAll dialog from here on out is me walking $Hands through things, which she does... brilliantly, and creepily silently. Not kidding when I say we spent hours doing things, unplugging and repluggings things, accessing things, typing passwords into things. All with the most verbose response from her being 'uh huh'. Despite this, having her there was practically like being telekinetic. \n\nThe white box? Headless device setup with Hyper V server 2016. The only unit in the office that had VMM setup was $Local's laptop. We get VMM setup on a workstation, I get her to reboot the server, get connected and add a 'Company' user with all the roles necessary to meet our standards, and find out that $Local knocked the office down because he was setting up a VM to run some Crypto staking on and stopped the VM for the server to conserve RAM. \n\nI get the VM they were using spun up, get the VHDD loaded, boom Data back, office is online. Then I spend hours on the phone with $Manager explaining how it happened, explaining how no, our monitoring couldn't have detected or prevented it because we were never made aware of anything $Local did and thus didn't have any of the connections to this box. \n\nObviously, this story ends with it still being our fault, $Local convinced $Manager to take our server completely offline and keep using the VM box, and I got to shake my head and put warnings everywhere about the whole thing, and start wishing my unconsumed coffee was something much harder... Worst part though? The White Box had worse hardware than our server. By a significant margin. ",

        "text": "**Do you like to read in Chronological order? Here is the [Index](https://www.reddit.com/r/Selben/comments/60r5ps/timeline_for_tfts_stories/)**\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**$Selben** - Previously Tier 1 tech support, now an IT contractor - a bit more into his career.\n\n\n**$Hardware** - The hardware guy in the IT department.\n\n\n**$Soda** - Entrepreneur and IT Consultant, and in a way $Selben’s boss. Extremely knowledgeable IT guru. Previously worked with $Selben at $SmallerCompany until they decided to move on. Also had a never-ending supply of 48oz sodas constantly on his desk, in his car, literally everywhere!\n\n\n**$Whatif** - Administrative assistant, not the brightest - but still a nice person.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n$Selben and $Soda had gotten a two-month contract working on some IT projects at a company through an old contact of $Soda’s. $Soda was locked away slaving away as a code monkey. $Selben could still chat with him during breaks, but otherwise was mostly on his own. He spent his time working on whatever needed to be done…typically things the other techs did not want to do.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nToday, $Selben was working with $Hardware. He was unpacking new desktops and setting them up in the computer lab to be configured. $Selben was about to take the empty boxes out to the recycle bin when he heard a familiar voice talking to $Hardware. \n\n\n&gt; $Hardware: What can I help you with?\n\n\n&gt; $Whatif: The printer by conference room two is acting up. I sent in an email, but nobody has replied. It’s been two days.\n\n\n$Selben thought he heard the faint words whispered, “Mal Diablo,” but couldn’t be sure.\n\n\n&gt; $Hardware: Mal di… Er… No problem, $Selben can check it out.\n\n\n$Selben peered around at the piles of boxes that rose up to his head and wiped the sweat from his brow.\n\n\n&gt; $Selben: No problem. What’s it doing?\n\n\n$Whatif held out a stack of papers. $Selben took them and saw they appears to be gibberish—words smashed over other words and some were upside down. It was pretty unreadable.\n\n\n&gt; $Selben: Okay, let’s check out your computer.\n\n\nThey walked down the hall, passing signs and inspirational office posters, like “Passion, what drives you?” with some guy staring at a pencil. Reaching the door to conference room two, $Selben found the printer, as well as overflowing recycle bins, and made a note to empty them along with the cardboard later. He restarted the printer, and reinstalled the drivers, and tested the results. \n\n\n$Whatif picked up the documents and found they still had the same issue. $Selben tried a generic driver, but got the same results. He then opted to try printing from his own machine. Same issue, so he tried using the identical printer by conference room one, and that worked fine.\n\n\nClearly the issue was with the Mal Diablo, so $Selben approached his fabled foe. He glared at Mal Diablo, which stared back with a happy green light, claiming all was well. He did a test print from its button panel. Clunk, clunk pvvvtt! The page shot out, again the text was garbled as if written in tongues. \n\n\n$Selben sighed, and returned to his desk to email the other techs to inquire if they had encountered the issue before. They only offered basic suggestions, which he had already tried. $Hardware and one of the techs poked at the printer as well, but Mal Diablo wouldn’t budge. It kept spewing out more and more gibberish.\n\n\n$Selben was told to contact the vendor. After being walked through the same troubleshooting steps that multiple people had already tried, they offered to send out an onsite tech within a week. A sign was placed on ~~Mal Diablo~~ the printer saying to not use it, or your documents would be ~~cursed~~ ruined.\n\n\nPrinter traffic was diverted over to the matching printer by conference room one. $Selben returned to his normal duties and hoped the printer tech would be able to figure out the problem.\n\n\nA few days later, the tech arrived spent several hours of troubleshooting. He concluded a part would need to be ordered. The tech had never seen the issue before, and was skeptical about his own solution, but it was the best anyone had come up with yet. $Selben suggested it was a curse. The tech only nervously laughed, and said he would be back in three days.\n\n\n**Two days later**\n\n\nThe printer by conference room one started doing the exact same issue! $Selben spent the better part of the day on the phone with the vendor and dragging any free techs over he could find. Everyone was stumped.\n\n\n$Selben took a late lunch. A pile of the cursed papers sat next to him, tormenting him. The wretched cursed gears of Mal Diablo, churning and grinding, wouldn’t leave his mind in peace. $Soda plopped down next to him with his own lunch, and started complaining about the $BasicallyCoding program he had been working on and how annoying it was.\n\n\n&gt; $Soda: It’s so similar to $+Coding, but won’t do cross-platform. They should just start over—it’s a mess!\n\n\n&gt; $Selben: Yeah, I’m not doing great either. I’m having issues with Mal di… er, one of the big printers.\n\n\n&gt; $Soda: Did you check the basics? Also, my wife is making pies in her cooking class!\n\n\n$Selben was intrigued by pies, but fought the urge to respond, knowing $Soda’s game.\n\n\n&gt; $Selben: Yeah, the vendor ordered parts. The second matching printer does the same now too. What kind of pies? (*Dang it!*)\n\n\n$Selben held up one of the pages, showing $Soda. He started rambling about caramel apple pie, strawberry rhubarb, pumpkin chiffon… while looking over the cryptic scrambled pages that had been printed out.\n\n\nThe next thing $Selben knew, he and $Soda were standing in front of Mal Diablo, as if somehow teleported.\n\n\n&gt; $Selben: Huh… What?\n\n\n&gt; $Soda: The drawer, open it.\n\n\n$Selben leaned down and opened the paper drawer. (When was the last time he had added paper to this?) He reached in and pulled out… A page covered in text?\n\n\nApparently, in an attempt to recycle, $Whatif had been taking discarded papers from the recycle bins and reloading them into the large printers. Presumably thinking the printer would somehow know to pick the correct side to use…or that it would magically clear the page before printing? $Selben wasn’t sure.\n\n\nWhen the whole office had been switched to the second printer, it had quickly run out of paper. So $Whatif reloaded the printer with used paper from the recycle bin. Once the used paper was replaced, the mysterious printing issues were resolved.\n\n\n$Selben still couldn’t explain $Soda’s powers of distraction or teleportation, but $Soda did bring him some pie the next day!",

        "text": "*As always, [all the stories]( https://redd.it/7i0esb) that have come before.*\n\n*Admin Note: This one is going to be tough to be proper TFTS, but since it happened in our unit, I figure it’s close enough.  Perhaps there’ll be Christmas Grace for me…*\n\n###Cast\n\n*In Order of Appearance*\n\n* $Mr. Neighborhood –Production Control Officer, Maintenance Test Pilot, Very Angry Man\n\n* $Augie-Supply guy. An individual with little to no common sense but a huge heart.  Moron when drunk.  Roommate of $Vern (and would later become my roommate).  Ordered to attend Alcohol Abuse meetings as a result of Da Bomb incident.\n\n* $PlatoonSergeant-Nice guy, in charge of Shops (my) platoon.  Fellow Engine Guy\n\n* $KG-My roommate, a sheetmetal guy and functional alcoholic with…questionable entertainment choices\n\n* $FirstSergeant-Company First Sergeant, total hippie\n\n* $Vern-Colorblind electrician, weightlifter, $Augie’s roommate.  Also lacking in common sense.\n\n* $SergeantMajor-Battalion Sergeant Major, Degree in Computer Science.  Got really sick and tired of my barracks network. \n\n***\n\nIt had been an eventful week in Deutschland.  The previous week, one of our Headquarters Company soldiers had [more or less commandeered a taxi on the Autobahn](https://redd.it/7kqkiq) and then Sunday $Augie had scrawled ‘[DA BOMB](https://redd.it/7kn5c7)’ on his car’s hood.  By Wednesday, my shop was still on edge, wondering when the other shoe would drop.  The tension was still lingering, of course, because as they always say, bad things come in threes….\n\n*(Beware the Taxi story, it will have spoilers for this one...)*\n***\n&gt;**$Mr. Neighborhood**  “WHERE THE !#*#&amp;!@ IS $AUGIE?!  SOMEONE ROBBED THE BANK!”\n\nMy entire shop looked up in shock as the enraged warrant officer came bursting through the seldom-used adjoining supply office door in our shop.  $Mr. Neighborhood was in charge of Production Control and was our Maintenance Test Pilot, but Supply was also a part of his platoon, which meant $Augie was his problem child to watch over.  It had just turned 0900, signaling the beginning of the working-part of the day, now that 0630 PT was over so it was quite possible $Augie was running late.  Everyone looked over at his roommate, $Vern, who gave a confused shrug.\n\n&gt;**$PlatoonSergeant** “We haven’t seen him, sir?”\n\n&gt;**$Mr. Neighborhood** “If you see that moron, you hold onto him and call me.”\n\nAnd as quickly as he appeared, the pilot disappeared.  We all looked around in shock—Robbed the bank?  Why on earth would someone think they could get away with that?  After a couple minutes of muddled conversation we set about work for the day and thought nothing else of it.  \n\n***\nWhen lunchtime came, I walked back to the barracks to discover Bundeswehr soldiers manning the foot gate exit towards our annex.  They searched my bag before letting me through, and then I was searched again when I returned after lunch.  It was highly unusual—I’d never seen any Bundeswehr before, much less any pulling security on our post.  \n\nIt was uncomfortable walking back to the hangar, I felt as if all eyes were on me.  Once I returned to the shop, it was revealed why.\n\n***\n\nAs mentioned earlier, 0630 is the start of our daily Physical Training regimen.  It usually lasts an hour, and then we have until 0900 to get cleaned up, changed, breakfast and then to the shop.  What we do with that time and how we manage it is up to us, so long as we’re in the shop by 0900.  While naturally the daily uniform is always set and the same, the PT uniform actually follows the same standard in the Army.  This particular morning was a somewhat chilly autumn day, so the uniform was PT pants and jacket, black stocking cap or rolled balaclava, black gloves, running shoes, and a reflective belt.  On our Kasserine, Aviation wore bright safety yellow reflective belts and the Military Police and Transportation battalions wore blaze orange.\n\nThe bank in question was situated near the foot gate, the MP Headquarters and chow hall.  They opened at first thing 0800 so that Soldiers running to breakfast could swing in as needed.  The first Soldier in that morning happened to be wielding a rather real-looking handgun and requested a large sum of money (All of it) to be placed into his backpack.  He then took the bag and disappeared.\n\nThe description given to the MPs?\n\nWhite male, approximate early to mid 20s, wearing a balaclava, PT jacket and pants, black gloves, running shoes.  \n\nWhich pretty much would have described the majority of the post’s population, except for one last item: suspect was wearing a *yellow PT belt.*\n\nAviation.\n\n***\n\nThat evening, we returned to our barracks only to be shuffled back outside as the MPs showed up with Battalion Leadership and even some dogs.  Starting from the top floor, they worked their way down, performing what’s called a ‘Health and Welfare’ on our rooms.  Basically leadership comes in, dump out everything you own and rifles through it looking for contraband, or in this case, some thousands of dollars.\n\nA ‘Health and Welfare’ inspection in the Army can be quite traumatizing and can reveal a number of…private things about an individual.  On my side of my room, for example, they discovered I’d taken a serious liking to hard lemonade and cider.  Over on $KG’s side, they discovered their personal comforts with their own sexuality as our $FirstSergeant was nearly buried alive in $KG’s physical pornography collection.  The MPs looked visibly uncomfortable and like they needed a shower.   $KG wasn’t actually standing there watching as I was due to being stuck on duty at Battalion that evening (there’s a rule about us having to be present when they go through our rooms) so $FirstSergeant dialed him up.\n\n&gt;**$FirstSergeant** “$KG, what the $*&amp;@ is all this porn?”\n\n&gt;**$FirstSergeant**  “What do you mean, that’s not all of it?”\n\n&gt;**$FirstSergeant** “….You have HOW MUCH on your computer?!”\n\n&gt;**$FirstSergeant** “…Also, you have a drinking problem.  I mean, how many cases of beer do you need?”\n\n&gt;**$FirstSergeant** “Wait, HOW much alcohol?”\n\n&gt;**$FirstSergeant** “…you have problems, $KG.  And now I need a shower.”\n***\n\nWhen it wasn’t our turn to have our life’s belongings rifled through, we were stuck standing outside in the cool evening in a mass of bored Soldiers, waiting to be told that none of us were the thief in question and they had wasted our time.  As we stood around bored, $SergeantMajor called us all to Attention and began speaking on what was going on.  Mid-speech, a pizza delivery guy came walking up and handed him a pizza and bottle of vodka (because alcohol delivery is a thing in Germany it turns out.).  \n\n&gt;**SergeantMajor** “Okay, who’re the smartasses who ordered the pizza and vodka?  $Vern and…DAMNIT $AUGIE!”\n\n$Augie was supposed to start at the Substance Abuse program the next morning.\n\n***\nSeveral months later, we received a new minion from our neighboring Aviation Battalion on post whom we stationed in our tool room to assist me.  Come to find out, his roommate had been the thief in question.  Instead of jogging off post as we all suspected, he actually just threw his backpack on, raised his cap and jogged to his barracks room about a half mile away, next door to the *Military Police Headquarters.*  Being as it was morning, no one thought twice about someone running down the street carrying a backpack, it was an entirely unremarkable event.  \n\nOnce in his room, he managed to avoid the health and welfare inspections from the MPs and leadership by hiding it within his stereo system’s speakers.  The following day, he left for the U.S. on leave and proceeded to squander every last cent of his ill-gotten gains.  As the story goes, somehow his roommate found out and demanded a cut—which he was unable to provide. So the roommate turned him in.  Not sure if that’s really what happened, but that’s what we’d heard.  \n\nRegardless, the thief actually had a very short trip to his new home in the U.S. Army Europe Prison—it’s only a couple blocks down the road from his barracks as well.\n",

Check in, plug in the offline equipment, check out.  But some people just don't want to do their [insert swear words here] jobs.\n \n&gt; **Tier 1:** simAlity I got a lady here who is demanding to speak to tier 2 pronto.  She's got an open ticket.  Can you take her?  \n&gt; **Me:** I can haz ticket number?  \n&gt; **Tier 1:** #365321  \n\nI brought up the ticket and swore.  \n\n&gt; **Me:**  Yeah, send her through.\n\n[fifteen seconds later my phone rings.]\n\n&gt; **Me:** Thank you for calling the Baby Bell, my name is simAlity, may I have your first and last name please?  \n&gt; **Caller** *[politely]***:** Clara Jackson.  I already have a ticket open.  The number is #365321  \n&gt; **Me:** Hi Clara.  I was actually just looking at your ticket. (*apologetically*) Please don't tell me the [on-site] tech no-showed again.  \n&gt; **Clara:** He no-showed again.  I haven't had internet in two weeks and I'm getting kinda peeved.  \n&gt; **Me:** To be very honest, I don't blame you one bit.  I am so sorry that you are going through this.  \n&gt; **Clara:** So do you want to schedule another tech?  \n&gt; **Me:** We can, if that is what you want.  Or I can try and walk you through the repair myself.  If we fail, then we'll send another tech out.  But if we succeed you can have Internet by the end of this call.  \n&gt; **Clara:**  Having Internet by the end of this call would be amazing.  \n&gt; **Me:**  Cool!  So, the first thing we need to do is find the media panel.  Look around for something that looks like a fusebox, but larger.  It will probably be in a closet.  \n\n&gt; **Clara:**  Found it!  Bad news.... It's screwed shut.  \n&gt; **Me:**  Got a screwdriver?  \n&gt; **Clara:** Yeah...umm... but I don't want to get in trouble...  \n&gt; **Me:** You're following my instructions.  The consequences will be on me.  \n&gt; **Clara:** You're sure?  \n&gt; **Me:** Absolutely.  This call is being recorded for quality assurance purposes.  All recordings are kept for an extended period of time.  Not sure how long, but at least three months.  You're covered.  \n&gt; **Clara:**  Awesome! Let me find my screwdriver.  \n \n[Getting the panel open took about 5 minutes. The screws were slightly stripped but with a bit of grunting and cursing, she was able to get it open.]\n\n&gt; **Clara:** Got it!  \n&gt; **Me:** Alright!  What do you see?  \n \nClara describes what is obviously a modem and a router.  I'm redacting the descriptions from this story because I'm not sure how widely used our preferred brands are and I don't want to ruin the story by substituting a brand that wouldn't be used in this kind of situation.  \n\n&gt; **Me:** So take a look at your router.  Do you see any lights on it?  \n&gt; **Clara:** No.  \n&gt; **Me:** Can you see where there SHOULD be lights?  \n&gt; **Clara:** Yeah.  \n&gt; **Me:** Touch it, does it feel like it is getting power?  \n&gt; **Clara:**  No.  \n&gt; **Me:** Look on the back.  Do you see anything plugged into it?  \n&gt; **Clara:** Four Ethernet cables and a smaller black cable.  Probably for power.  \n&gt; **Me:** That sounds about right.  Is the other end of the power cable plugged in?  \n&gt; **Clara:**  Nope.  Want me to do so?  \n&gt; **Me:** Yes.  There should be a power strip down at the bottom.  \n&gt; **Clara:**  A bunch of lights just came on.  Now they are off.  Now one is flashing....  \n&gt; **Me:**  This is the boot up process.  It will take a few minutes.  Let me know when the lights stabilize.  \n\nFive minutes later the lights had stabilized but the Internet still wasn't working.  \n\n&gt; **Me:**  Okay, so we're still missing something.  Can you describe the lights to me, please?  \n&gt; **Clara:** Errr...I'm colorblind.  \n&gt; **Me:** No problem.  Can you take a picture and email it to me?  \n&gt; **Clara:**  Sure!  \n&gt; **Me:** [provides email address]\n \nThe picture arrived a few minutes later.  \n\n&gt; **Me:** Okay, based upon what I am seeing here, the router isn't connected to the modem. Take a look at the modem.  There should be an ethernet cable plugged in next to the coax cable.  \n&gt; **Clara:**  Got it.   \n&gt; **Me:**  Tell me if the other side of the cable is plugged into anything.  \n&gt; **Clara:**  No.  \n&gt; **Me:** Figured as much.  Now take a look at the router.  Do you see an available Ethernet port?  \n&gt; **Clara:**  Yes.  Plug it in?  \n&gt; **Me:**  Probably, but this is where things can get tricky so let's be sure.  Take a closer look at the available port.  Is it labeled?  \n&gt; **Clara:** Yes.  \"Internet\".  \n&gt; **Me:** Excellent.  And the other ports, are they labeled, \"Ethernet\"?  \n&gt; **Clara:**  ummm...yes.  \n&gt; **Me:**  You're sure?  \n&gt; **Clara:** Positive.  \n&gt; **Me:**  Okay, go ahead and plug in the ethernet cable.  \n&gt; **Clara:**  Done!  \n&gt; **Me:**  Okay, let's give it a minute and then I want you to send me another picture.  \n\nWhile we waited, I logged into the controller and started refreshing the page for her access point almost obsessively.  Clara sent me another picture and everything looked okay but still no Internet.  Just as I was about to give up, the access point's status in the controller changed from \"Disconnected/Offline\" to \"Provisioning\" and then \"Online.\"\n\n&gt; **Me:**  I think we've done it.  Can you try to access the Internet again?  \n&gt; **Clara** *(long pause)***:**  It works!!!  OMG it works!  Thank you so much!  \n \nCalls like this make my day good.  ",

My mom can't do anything in under a minute unless it's to look up what my new prescription does, because of course that's the only search you can do in 5 seconds.\n\nBut anyway, my aunt pulled out her computer yesterday, and opened it up for me.  Yay windows 10.  She pulls up the infinityX website, tried to stream survivor, and gets a flash player message with a link to instructions to enable.  Next thing I hear:\n\n&gt; I already tried doing these steps to enable this\n\nYeah right (not in a mean way, my aunt is really nice)  At this point, $5 says she forgot the last step.  Sure enough, she's got flash enabled (also, what a terrible settings menu edge has) for the browser but not the infinityX website.  Missed the last step.\n\nThat's alright!  Extra cake for me!",

Someone had signed up for our ADSL service, the date for hooking everything up had come and this was before the ISP offered the free technician to hook everything up so people were on their own. We provided manuals, but who reads those right?\n\nSo I get the call, give my opening spiel and ask how I can help them.\n\n&gt;$cust: My internet connection should've gone active today but it's not working.\n\nSo I start with getting the customer data, checking if the connection had been marked as delivered yes etc. And yeah on our end everything seems to be okay, but the modem isn't online.  \n\n&gt;$me: Everything seems to have been activated. Can you tell me where your modem is? And which, if any of the lights are on?\n\n&gt;$cust: I'm right next to the modem. And none of the lights are on.\n\n&gt;$Me: Okay that shouldn't be. Can you check if the modem is plugged in to a wall outlet and if the switch at the bottom is in the ON position?\n\n&gt;$Cust: It's not connected to anything. Why isn't this working?\n\n&gt;$Me: Well your modem needs to be connected to a wall outlet and to the ISRA point for power and the data connection to the internet. I can walk you through connecting the modem if you like.\n\n&gt;$Cust: Connected? I bought wireless internet! Why do I need to connect it to anything?\n\n&gt;$Me: &lt;Long, but dumbed down explanation about how an ADSL connection works.&gt; Would you like me to walk you through the installation?\n\n&gt;$Cust: I threw out all the cables. I paid for wireless internet!\n\n&gt;$Me: Can you collect the cables from your bin? You're really going to need them in order to connect to the internet.\n\n&gt;$cust: No I threw them out three weeks ago. Look if this thing isn't wireless like you said it is. Then I want to cancel my subscription right away because I'm not paying for this!\n\nI tried offering to send them new cables for free. But no dice.\nThat she wanted to cancel her subscription were the magic words. I  happily transferred her to retention, letting my colleague know what the situation was, we delivered and that there was no reason to refund or cancel the contract.\n\nBut really, who in their right mind just throws out every single thing that comes with the installation package, without consulting the manual, without calling the helpdesk or anything?!",

        "text": "So here's a story about how some end users couldn't grasp how databases and such work. Be gentle, it's my first post, so I'll try to make it legible without revealing too much info.\n\nBackground on the issue: There was a catch-22 type set of errors present where a user couldn't proceed with a quote on our software due to an indicator getting set to \"yes\", nor could they do the usual workaround due to another indicator set to \"999\" that sometimes occured simultaneously (thus the catch-22). Don't ask me why this stupid problem existed in the first place; that's above my pay grade! Users can also *sorta* look at stuff in IMS, which our software is basically a GUI for. But a lot of them don't really know how IMS works so they don't know what they're looking at half the time.\n\nLong story short we were fixing these  \"errors\" by doing a database fix to reset the two indicators back to \"no\" and \"0\". It didn't fix the underlying issue, but it allowed them to continue what they're doing and that's all they really needed. Out of hundreds of transactions a day this only happened a few times a week at most and maybe once a month at least.\n\nVery simple thing and I was basically the guy who mediated between the user and the person who actually performed the database fix. I'm capable of doing database changes myself, but yaknow, SOX. Nobody is allowed to make any changes by themselves, even one this small. So this was the quick and dirty way of working around this problem but it still used up time. I was given this most honored position when the guy who used to do it, moved to another department.\n\nWhen a user thought this issue had come up we had a file that they opened in VFE, through TSO on a 3270 session (we even made a handy little clist for them to open that file right away!), then added their name, date, relevant info etc. And then sent me an email requesting the fix. The file is just for record keeping and dates back to like 1995. And the copy-paste they always threw in the email was something like \"Could you please run the fix table for the 999 error?\" or \"Request to run the 999 job\". It was the same 5 users that would request this on a weekly basis (they were higher-ups that I guess would get the call from some other user about it, ugh, I know this is all *very* inefficient...), but somehow they seemed for forget the entire process beyond putting their info in the file and sending me an email, after one day.\n\nI don't know where they got the idea that a flat file is a table, what a \"999 job\" is, or how to \"run\" a database fix, or a table for that matter, lol. But no matter how many times I politely explained that the file was just basically a piece of paper with their info on it they insisted we \"run the fix table/999 job\". Old habits die hard I guess. At one point I had a notepad file with my own copy-paste text to throw into the reply email, and it always had the same explanation at the end, of what the database fix actually did, and what *not* to do afterward.\n\nThe first step for me was I had to check and see if this error was actually the problem. If both of those indicators weren't set, it was not this particular problem and resetting both of them with the database fix wouldn't resolve it. If that's the case, a ticket must be opened. I know it's hard for them to understand but you'd think being told that a fix won't work, would give you enough info that *this particular fix will not work*, no matter how many times you ask me to do it.\n\nAnother thing that wouldn't resolve it is the user would go back into the software and try doing the same thing they just did after the fix was put in, and the error would occur again. Which would put us back at the beginning of the cycle, yay! They'd had this explained to them in my emails: *Don't go back in and do ABC again, because the error will happen again. Do XYZ instead.* But nope, ain't got time for that. \"Whoops, can you run the 999 job again, I went back and did the thing you just told me not to do..........sorry!!!\"\n\nSo say I checked it and only one indicator was set. I emailed the user and told them this. Partially in layman's terms and I also provided the actual info from Datavan, so they could put that in the ticket they now needed to write up. This \"both indicators need to be set for the fix to work\" idea was explained to them for years, before I even started working there. But apparently they needed to ask at least one more time, every time, after I tell them the database fix will not work, if I could just \"run the 999 fix\".\n\nNo, you need to open a ticket. Tell them what I just told you. Like every other time this has happened *in the past week*.\n\n\"But why can't you run the table? I already put the info in the table!!!\"\n\n\"I'm sorry but both indicators aren't set, so no, I can't.\"\n\n\"But I can see a \"999\" on &lt;IMS  screen&gt; so that means you *have* to run the 999 job right?\"\n\n*headdesk*\n\nAfter a while they started diverting all of these database fix requests into tickets for a more permanent/clean fix, so the users would stop going back in and repeating it over and over and then crying for help. So luckily I got out of the catch-22 situation... Except for when they forget that we stopped doing them months ago, and I get a copy-pasted email asking for the \"999 fix\". Usually it's just a forward of the last email they sent asking for it, with some different info.\n\nOther fun things included one user who thought that putting their info into the file and saving it would automatically \"run\" this fix, without telling anyone, and after they got no reply email that it was done, would send an angry email to multiple people asking why the table hadn't been run!\n\nAlso, once in a while, a user would forget to close the file, so no one else could even read it (you'd just get a \"FILE IS IN USE BY ANOTHER USER\" message). Or a user would email me telling me they were getting this message when they needed to go into the \"table\" and use it. Luckily there's a clist to just type WHOHAS with the file path, and it'd show the user ID of  who had that file open. Then I could send them a Skype message to please close the file so I could see what they put in there. I like to pretend they would sit at their desk and believe I was some kind of wizard with the power to figure out who had the file open...\n\nHope that was entertaining, or at least gave you something to read while you were on the John. Cheers!",

For those who don't know, I work tech support for a university and we are not only in charge of all technology on campus, but we also have to man our open computer lab when our federal work student are not able to. \n\nWell today was one of those days. Not only am I  the unlucky smuck designated to work over the holiday, but I also have to cover computer lab because FWS is sick. I'm down there praying no professor run into any problem in class because only classes in session is in building across campus and I do not want to leave this lab unattended. \n\nBackground: so a little extra info for this to make sense. There is only one printer in the lab, it's not free to print and the machine does not take cash. $m= me , $u= user.\n\n$u: (walks up to front desk) how much is it to print and how do I print?\n\n$m: (I start explaining) well once you're ready to print just click print and a window will pop up asking you to sign into your student account. Once you sign in, your print job will be uploaded and sent to the printing station. You can either slide your student ID through the card reader or if you forgot it just click the button that says sign in (it doesn't actually say this but I can't remember what it says lol). The machine only takes three form of payment and cash isn't one of them. You can use your credit/debit, a print card you can get at library( which is all the way across campus), or if you have money in your student account you can use that.\n\n$u: oh okay I have a debit card.(walks away to get on computer)\n\nA couple minutes go by with just us 2 being only one in lab. I keep an eye on her because from experience I know that what I say to users tend to go in one ear and out the other. So she gets up and walks to printing station, and I think 'okay good she doesn't need my help after all. So I go back to looking at my computer screen only to notice someone standing in front of my desk from corner of eye. Look up to find same user standing there with a confuse look on her face.\n\n$u: uh I did everything you said to do and saw my print job on the kiosk, but when I click print button a new window pops up with 3 giant buttons on the screen. I don't know what to do.\n\nI know exactly what she is talking about, and normally I would explain without embarrassing user, but I'm already annoyed that I can't do the job assigned to me over the holiday because I have noone to watch this stupid lab.\n\n$m: (walks up with her to the kiosk) how were you gonna pay?\n\n$u: my debit card, but I don't know which button to click.\n\n$m: (points to button that says pay with debit/credit in a big ass font that I know she can read because she obviously read the previous button that said print) uh how about clicking that one.\n\nI've never seen anyone turn red so fast like she did.\n\n",

Aren't you listening?\n\n  &gt; $ME: Do you live outside? Like I'm talking about the things holding up your roof.\n\n  &gt; $CX: Yeah, I don't have one, I'm in the middle of the room\n\nThis is going to take another shot.\n\n&gt; $Me: Ok, well can I get you to plug it into the wall? Even if that means moving the printer.\n \n &gt; $CX: Not without an extension cord. Look can I talk to a technician who knows what they're doing?\n\n  &gt; $ME: No technician is going to be able to just plug it in for you without physically being there.\n \n &gt; $CX: But I thought you said you had control of my computer? What do I pay you guys for?\n\n  &gt; $ME: I do, but once again. THAT IS NOT POSSIBLE.\n\n  &gt; $CX: Well then I want to work with your boss.\n\n  &gt; $ME: Certainly Ma'am, I'll have him call you as soon as he gets the ticket.\n\nNow it should be noted that basically the only T2 left was about to head out and wasn't going to take anymore tickets, there would be no call until later tomorrow. I tidied up  my notes on what the issue was and the solution, and happily sent it out to the T2 team.",

        "text": "As I've mentioned in my previous posts the company I work for sells their own brand of vehicle GPS trackers and service. People will sometimes call in to get information about our product and services despite the fact that everything they're asking about is readily available on our website, but it's fine we take the time to answer their questions and wish them a great day.  \nOnce in a while we'll get a call like this where the prospective buyer wants some technical details which, although the information exists in the form of technical specifications, not everyone is familiar with the technobabble that is GPS/GPRS/WCDMA/GSM/mA/mAh.  \nSo we explain it in layman's terms. This tale is about one such call, or so I thought at first.\n\n$Me = $$author.  \n$User = Seemingly intelligent user.\n\n$User called, and asked about how the devices communicate. He seemed to be intelligent, so I explained how the device's GPS module gets its location by calculating distances between connected satellites, and then the device sends that information to our server using GPRS to communicate through a cell tower.  \nHe seemed to understand this, and asked if there was no cell signal would that mean no data?  \nI responded that the device has on-board storage, so while it might miss a real time update it would update the server with the missing info as soon as it entered cell service.  \nHis next question was what if it's out in an area that doesn't have a connection to satellites?  \nTo which I answered that unfortunately there is no cure for that. It may not update or it may show a false location at that point, but there are very few places like this unless there is specific interference. \n\nNow most people understand this, and this is the point where a customer would normally ask;\n&gt;&gt;\"Well if there is more satellite coverage than cell coverage, then why don't you guys just use satellite to communicate as well?\"\n\nWhile this might sound ridiculous to anyone who understands technology, it is understandable for those who are less familiar with how communications work and are unaware of the expense to get a satellite in orbit. However, my $User didn't ask this question, because he was smarter than that instead he asked:\n\n&gt;**$User**: \"So where can I get something that can give me the location in some other way without GPS satellites?\"  \n&gt;**$Me:** *Slightly flustered, I just couldn't hold back (also The Big Bang Theory was coming to mind)* \"Um... NASA?\"\n\nThankfully $User took my response in good humor, and realized that this probably wasn't available in the private sector if anywhere.\n\nI told my boss about it when he came back in, and he had a good laugh with a similar response.",

Needless to say things at the office have been kinda stressful and not slowing down, but we just got a few hours to go!  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo today we're only putting in a half day, and I got the typical ticket early in the morning from a client who got an email from her \"director\". She's a smart cookie so she knew not to open it but rather was just letting us know so that we could file an abuse report on the email account. Knowing that the ticket was going to be very much an open-close case. I decided to throw an extra note of flair to the tend of the ticket:\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt;**$Savy:** (ticket note) Called $Client and confirmed that $CEO's account didn't get compromised but rather the email account was created through $ISP and just used his name. I advised the typical action of delete/block. *(At the bottom of the signature line)* \"On the 12th day of TechMas my user gave to me, 12 phishing emails\".\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAfter a while I decided what the rest of the 11 days of TechMas would look like so I came up with the following to use for future tickets today:\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nOn the 12 days of TechMas my user gave to me:  \n\n* 12 phishing emails  \n* 11 urgent phone calls  \n* 10 past due tickets  \n* 9 broken laptops  \n* 8 password resets  \n* 7 on-site visits   \n* 6 printers jamming  \n* 5 stressed out teeeeeeeeeechs  \n* 4 expired accounts  \n* 3 websites down  \n* 2 vendor calls  \n* And a server that just failed POOOOOOOST  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nHappy Holidays!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nEdit: Spelling",

TL;DR at the end.\n\n**$ME**: Me obviously.  Over 30 years of tech support on and off (official and unofficial.  Back when this tale is told not so confident and performing internal support for staff.  Now much older and assertive.\n\n**$EU**: End User with the issue.\n\n**$Manager**: $EU's manager, and my manager up the chain (not my direct manager).\n\nScene: Local office of $Company that is better known for their air-conditioner arm than their IT Solutions arm.  I had volunteered to do the holiday shift (cover Christmas/New Year period), as I was low on annual leave.\n\n**$EU** logs a job saying she can't open a spreadsheet.  It gives some kind of error.  Screenshot shows the error.\n\nLooking at the error I know immediately what the issue is.\n\n**$ME** responds to the ticket (which automatically e-mails the person who lodged the ticket) that issue is a VB Coding error in the spreadsheet, and that I'm not a VB Coder, it's out of my scope, and thus, they need to get the original coder to fix it.  I close the ticket.\n\n**$EU** re-opens the ticket saying the person who coded their spreadsheet did it on their computer at home (not on their work laptop, their personal computer), and that it works for them, the coder is on holidays and won't be back until after the Christmas/New Year break, and that it's urgent they have access to the spreadsheet.\n\nI tell **$EU** that, yet again, it's out of my scope as I'm not a VB Coder and close the ticket.\n\n**$EU** escalates to **$Manager**, who e-mails me and asks to see me.\n\nSo I head to the other building to see **$Manager**.\n\n**$Manager**: We need to access this spreadsheet!\n\n$Me: As I mentioned to $EU, the issue isn't with the computer or the network.  It's with the spreadsheet.  It has a VB coding error.  I'm not a VB coder, it's out of my scope.  I can't fix it.  The original coder needs to fix it.\n\n$Manager: You need to fix the spreadsheet or I'll tell your manager you aren't being helpful.\n\n~~\"I'm sorry but I can't.  I will advise my manager as such and the impossible request being made of me.  This is my professional opinion of X number of years doing IT Support.  I have seen this error multiple times and it always leads to the same issue, a VB Coding Error.  This is not something I can fix, as I have mentioned multiple times.  Any attempt to do so would be a waste of my time, and I have other issues that I can fix that are waiting for me.\"  And then I reported it to my manager.~~\n\nUnfortunately, I was in my first six months in this job so I said I would see what I could do and left **$Manager**'s office.\n\nGet a copy of the file.  Go back to my office.  Try to open it in (then the latest) Office 2010.  VB Error.\n\nGrab a spare Windows 7 computer - and use our deployment system to deploy Office 2007. Wait an hour for deployment/installation (bad network speeds).\n\nTry to open spreadsheet.  Same VB Error.\n\nOK.  Grab a Windows XP Laptop, deploy Office 2003.  Wait another hour.\n\nTry to open spreadsheet.  Ah-ah - useful VB error - Circular Reference in Formula X at Cell Y.  Save as Excel 2003 file.\n\nMove to Windows 7 Laptop with Office 2007.  Same useful error.  Save as 2007 Excel file.\n\nSame deal with office 2010.  Save as 2010 Excel file.\n\nSend file back to **$EU** with **$Manager** CC'd.  \"Please find attached the Excel file.  As you can see, when you try to open it the VB Coding has a circular reference error.\n\nAs I mentioned, this is a VB Coding error, which I have no experience in and is out of my scope.\".\n\nClose ticket.\n\n**$EU** e-mails back: \n\nThanks.  The file isn't that urgent.  We can wait until the coder gets back.\n\nNo word from **$Manager**. \n\nTL;DR:  Ouroborus eats its own tail.  Spent 3 hours proving what I already knew. Urgent access to file isn't urgent.\n",

        "text": "As many of you probably already know, this is almost always a symptom of having tapping turned on on the touchpad. Your thumb accidentally grazes it while typing, and then the cursor moves. The fix is to disable tapping, or set the touchpad to disable itself while using the keyboard (if that option is available).\n\nBut let me backtrack, because this isn't even why the user called me.\n\nThis guy is someone I hadn't heard from in a couple of years. The last time we worked together, we ordered him a refurbished laptop with Windows 7, a 2.5 (?) ghz Core i5, and a nVidia Quadro K1000M in it. It was pretty nice for a refurb, and had been working well as far as I knew.\n\nHe called me to tell me he had bought a new laptop, and that it was infected or compromised. There had been a scareware pop-up, he called the phone number... At some point during that process, they had set a startup password on it, and he didn't know what it was. He wanted me to restore it to factory settings.\n\nI got to his house and looked at it. It was a $200 plastic piece of junk with an A6 processor in it. But I started resetting Windows 10 anyway. Then I turned to his old one to see what was wrong with it.\n\nThere was nothing wrong with it. Absolutely nothing. And it was way faster than his new one, unsurprisingly. \n\nAfter watching him type and verifying his thumbs were hitting the hardware buttons for the pointing stick (it's a Lenovo Thinkpad), all I needed to do was install the correct drivers for the touchpad and pointing stick. Then I had the right settings available so that he could type without the cursor moving around on its own.\n\n**Me:** \"Did you have anyone look at this computer before you decided to replace it?\"\n\n**Him:** \"No.\"\n\n**Me:** \"And do you think you're qualified to diagnose computer problems yourself?\"\n\n**Him:** \"Hell no. I don't know anything about computers.\"\n\n**Me:** \"Then why did you replace the computer without having someone try to fix it?\"\n\n**Him:** \"I don't know. I feel like such a schmuck.\"\n\nThis is a guy who wanted me to shut down and start up the computer twice once I was done, just to make sure he was still able to check his email. Of course he doesn't know how to diagnose or fix issues himself. He can barely turn the thing on and off.\n\nI let him know the new one might be okay to give to someone \nelse, or to use as a backup if something happens to the old one.\n\nI also let him know he can't necessarily assume a new computer is going to be better than his old one, if he doesn't check what parts are in both of them.",

        "text": "Hello, Greetings, and Salutations, TFTS. I am a FTP, and a Peanut Gallery commentator (lurker doesn't seem to really fit me on this sub).\n\nTL;DR at the bottom, please ridicule, judge, correct, compliment, and create philosophical dissertations. I would really like to become a halfway decent member of technical Reddit communities like TFTS :)\n\nA little about me: I am a young dude with a BS in CNSA (long way of saying jack of all trades IT) who got a DBA position straight out of school for a $SovereignGov here in the Mid-Western U.S. of A. I am no longer there, and am now a HelpDesk/IT Support \"Intern\" (read: I really need a new FT job but still need to work on selling myself because I'm too modest and socially awkward) for $LocalGov\n__________________________________________________\nNow, if you are familiar with what a $SovereignGov is, you will know that many of them have ooh big shiny $HighRiskLittleRewardEntertainmentComplexes\n\nIf you don't, then they're money generating databases with sparkly machines with buttons that run 24/7. \n\n**This is a tale of bad timing and unexpected explosions!**\n\nAfter a gigantic holiday (turkey) dinner, Sleep was of the essence. I had not planned on partaking in the sequence of after dinner delights that include stampeding the sick and weak in hopes of paying 80% less than \"regular price\" on 100 inch televisions, and had no intention of setting an alarm to wake up on a paid holiday to do anything except, well, reflect on said dinner.\n\nI am &gt;$DBA\nNet admin 5 is $GuyWhoWasCalledToFixItNow ....but we will call him $Joe\n\n12:30AM: $DBA phone rings, from $Joe:\n&gt;$Joe: we have a problem that I'm going to need you to help me fix\n\n*you don't say!*\n\n&gt;$Joe: Now, we had an equipment failure and we believe that most of the other systems are up but we are having troubles with $TaxAuditSystem\n\n&gt;$DBA: Ok...\n\n*holy #$@%#$^ it's still close to midnight......*\n\n&gt;$DBA: Well, what did we have happen?\n\n&gt;$Joe: Well, it seems that we suddenly melted a storage controller and somehow things didn't fail over properly and we lost drives on most of the virtual machines. We didn't particularly **LOSE** them, but rather, they were dropped and we had to bring them back up. I know where everything is but it isn't clear where the rest of these drives/files were supposed to be.\n\n*Great*\n\nSo, for those that may not be aware, the USA taxes winnings. These are more recently required to be kept track of electronically, and there's popular software vendors that supply solutions to do this. On this particular virtual machine cluster, such solution in place, and this is what $Joe is referring to.\n\n&gt;$DBA I suppose that doesn't sound so bad. I'm glad you were able to get the rest of the systems back up until now. So what do you need me to do?\n\n*please assure me that the customer facing systems are online, RGE type systems are not fun to deal with ~~when I'm woken from my deep, comfortable sleep on paid holidays~~.*\n\n&gt;$Joe: Well, everything else seemed to just come back up after we rebooted things several times, and this one didn't, so it's your turn now\n\n*sigh, internal: (ok Mr. Senior Net Admin ex-DBA rant, grovel......blargh)*\n\n&gt;$DBA: Ok, certainly, let me remote in and see where we are at\n\nServer is up, M$$QL is running, and things were set up in a way that they would be least likely to fail (yay M$ best practices!) but, wait, woah hold on, what?\n\n&gt;$DBA: So, somehow the services seem to be running but there's no logs and no backups, and it looks like the data drive is \"there\" but it's half empty\n\n*?_? (please send help and sanity)*\n\nSide note: No Data OR No Logs = No M$$QL\n\n&gt;$Joe: well, what do you think we should do?\n\n&gt;$DBA: I think this can all be recreated, but I have no idea from when, since everything that's local is gone and we have my jobs (backup, maintenance, etc) running at X, Y, and Z, which means that not all of them completed. I also never received the documentation I requested about how the system actually works.\n\n&gt;$Joe (restless): I mean, I can restore from $BigBackupSoftware but aren't you supposed to know that information? I guess we do what we can and hope it works, you're the DBA.\n\n*cringe*\n\nI mean, he's not wrong, but as the young guy and **THE** resident DBA, I had issues communicating with the comfortable old timers about things that I needed to do my job properly. Probably both of our faults for multiple reasons, but I digress.\n\n&gt;$DBA: Alright, no problem. Let's see, I'll grab the rest of my docs and see how this goes\n\n*3 hours later, after making sure my Google-fu was on point, my documentation was for the correct machine, had gone over a game plan with $Joe, and the rebuild/restoration was well under way*\n\n&gt;$DBA: uhhh, looks like either these backups aren't working or the way I'm trying to restore these backups isn't correct.\n\n&gt;$Joe: You do realize this is a possible Resume Generating Event, right? But hey, keep looking and trying, I'm sure you'll get something out of this.... we at least have some working backups\n\n*Thanks, I TOTALLY needed that reminder*\n\n&gt;$DBA: thanks, but I'm going to look up a few more things and double check my steps, maybe I worked too quickly.\n\nAt this point we called in the $FreshSurf vendor who is \"familiar with the database\" to oversee everything. This is literally the only relevant statement about him, as he was basically just a warm body on the phone.\n\n&gt;$DBA: ok, I think I need to make an adjustment here....\n\nI explicitly spelled out everything I was doing and going to do for the next 20 minutes, regardless of if they knew anything about it.\n\n&gt;$Joe: ok\n\n*ssss........uper*\n\nafter clicking go, the initial DB restore begins, without errors\n\n&gt;$DBA: hey, that's looking better!\n\n&gt;$Joe: Well that's good! How many log backups did you say you needed to do?\n\n&gt;$DBA: Well, X and Y finished, but not Z, so we have every single transaction log backup to do, individually, up until the next full backup, because that last bit didn't have time to finish before the storage controlled swiped the rug from underneath its feet\n\nAnother hour passed as i double checked all of my settings for each individual GUI restore that I did, then the final moment (read: \"well, I think it's ok now, but the users are next in line to scream\") came:\n\n&gt;$DBA: Alright everything is restored up until exactly xx:yy:zz, which is W amount of time before it went down. Let's start the services to see if it looks ok\n\n*services started, no errors, no problems*\n\n&gt;$Joe well it looks good, I'm proud of you for holding your cool and you did a good job. Go to sleep, I'll tell $Director that everything is done that we can do, and we will have to meet about this next week\n\n*Success*\n\n\nAfterward, we all were reminded about why the backups were set up the way they were (had it written down, screenshots, emails, everything, man.... I felt like my own attorney Monday morning) and that it was an acceptable means of restoration. Oh, and the user base / my department members were finally able to tell me how the system actually worked so that I could properly follow up with if the data was current or not. WHAT A GREAT BLACK FRIDAY DEAL!\n\nTL;DR: blew a storage controller on a \"totally redundant virtual environment\", got overtime to bring a tax solution online because it interacted with live gaming data and ended up having to pull he bare bone \"one by one restore all by hand\" solution because the system was so hosed it needed to basically be rebuilt.",

They determined her hard drive was failing, and told her to take it to a local authorized service center.\n\nThen I got this email from her:\n\n\"So it was a bad hard drive. Apparently it was defective from the get go. Best Buy will send it back to lenovo. Under the warranty they will replace the hard drive. I guess that means I will always have a bad computer.\"\n\nI was confused about what she meant by this, so I sent her back the following:\n\n\"If the bad part is replaced, why are you defining the rest of the computer as bad also?\"\n\nHer response:\n\n\"I just think once they open it up it's defective.  I know they say they fix It though.\"\n\nSo apparently, she thinks the hard drive has a cold, and all the other components could have caught it somehow. I often have to restrain myself from telling her, \"That's not how anything works. Stop trying to diagnose issues yourself.\" So instead I wrote her back:\n\n\"That doesn't make sense. All of the parts in the computer are separate and most of them have different manufacturers. The memory and the motherboard and all the other components can't catch whatever went wrong with the hard drive. Hard drives are old technology that is prone to failure. That's why I usually recommend solid state drives now.\"\n\nOf course, I told her to buy a computer with a SSD before, and she didn't.

        "text": "This is the tale of two printers.  \n\nIt has oft been spoken in these hallowed threads that printers are evil.  I protest that statement, and adhere to the premise that printers are not necessarily evil by nature, but rather a product of their environment.  Printers, like all IT assets, are pure and forthright at birth.  It is not until they have been defiled by the spawn of Satan, henceforth known as users, that they become evil.  These two tales happened several years apart, but will prove the inherently good nature of printers.  \n\nCast of Characters:  \n&gt;$me:  Then, a fresh young computer geek ready to conquer the world.  Now, a wisened, cynical IT professional.  \n&gt;$cw_boss:  Formerly a coworker, now my boss  \n\n**Printer 1**\nI had mentioned in a previous tale how our offices were located in a different building.  One day, one of my favorite printers, a Genicom 4440xt, died.  This is a huge line printer, about the size of a washing machine, and about the same weight.  $cw_boss and I hop in my truck and drive the 2 blocks to the hospital to get a replacement.  As we go to load it, on its back, into the bed of the truck, it slips.  Drops from a height of about 4 feet flat on its back onto the pavement.  It was so loud, it sounded like a bomb went off.  \n\nWe finish loading it without incident, and take it back ot the office.  Get it all hooked up and hold our breath.  The beast worked!  It started sending out reports at 600 lines per minute, and never missed a beat.  Kept working until we retired that model about 5 years later.  In this case, I was the user, but the printer refused to be corrupted.  \n\n**Printer 2**\nWe finally arrived at the day when we would no longer print and mail pay statements to employees.  We had been direct deposit for quite some time, but stil printed all kinds of pay-related information and snail-mailed it to employees.  \n\nIt was decided that we would have kiosks in the hospital where our employees could access their pay advice online, and print it out.  Our hospital ended up with 7 of these kiosks placed strategically around the campus.  Each one was in a secure cabinet, and housed a PC and laser printer.  You log into the system, print your paystub, and reach in the little slot at the bottom and grab your printout.  \n\nOne day, we get an alert that we have a printer down in a kiosk.  $cw_boss and I go look.  It appears that someone has used the kiosk as a trash can, and thrown a half-empty bottle of YooHoo in the printer door.  We take the whole kiosk (almost 200 pounds) back to the workshop to assess the damage.  \n\nLaser printers generate heat.  Enclosed spaces magnify that heat.  What we had was a laser printer *coated* in a soured, baked-on chocolate coating.  We spent two days cleaning the cabinet with a putty knife so we could re-deploy with a new printer.  We spent another half-day stripping the printer down and cleaning it to a point it would work again.  It did work, in spite of the user who defiled it.  \n\nPrinters are not naturally evil, only when defiled by users, be they end users or IT staff.  \n",

I just want you to forward it to the 2nd Level, since it has to be resolved with a technician.\n\n$me: Ok, maybe, but I have to look at the problem first, so I can forward the ticket with Proper Information. \n\n$Dr: Ok, if you really have to...\n\nAfter remoting into his PC, I look at his screenshot, try to close it and lo and behold, it closes. \n\n$Dr: How did you do that?\n\n$me: I pressed the X on the upper right side...?\n\n$Dr: I tried that too but nothing happend!\n\n$me: Can you show me?\n\n$Dr proceeds to open the screenshot again, and trying to close the screenshot.... in the screenshot.\n\n$me: Sir, you have to use the Upper right X.\n\n$me shows him the upper right X  \n\n$Dr: Well, okay... bye.\n\n\n\nAnd that's how most of those pesky title owning attorney behave. They think just because THEY tried something it has to be the technician or 3rd Level Support helping them.",

I figure it's probably something simple like the volume is muted or Windows is pointed at the wrong audio device, so I remote in.\n\nCheck the volume mixer, everything's good. Audio is playing from a YouTube video open in Firefox and, yes, it's showing up on the mixer. 'Kay. Check the playback devices for anything weird — there's only two devices (Headphones and Speakers). Headphones are disabled and the speakers clearly show there is audio going to them.\n\n*Oh Neptune.*\n\n&gt;**$me**: What exactly is the speaker setup on this machine?\n&gt;\n&gt;**$user**: Well it's not my computer—\n\n*Ohhhhh Neptune. You might know what's coming at this point.*\n\n&gt;**$user**: —but I just assumed there was an internal speaker or something.\n\nNote: there are *some* desktops at this Uni that do, in fact, have an internal speaker, but they're exceedingly rare in my experience.\n\n&gt;**$me** (internally):......welp.\n&gt;\n&gt;**$me**: Well, if there are no speakers hooked up, that would definitely explain the lack of sound. Anything else I can help you with?\n&gt;\n&gt;**$user**: (laughing in background) Nope, you've been really helpful and I think we've got it from here. Thanks!\n\nAt least we usually get good-natured users here.",
