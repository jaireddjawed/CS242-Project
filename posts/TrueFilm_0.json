        "text": "I've always remembered this as the worst of the 1980's Indiana Jones. Mostly though because I kept forgetting nearly every plot point apart from the fact that they eat monkey brain.\n\nComing back to it, I like it more than Raiders and I know how insane this must sound. Because while Raiders seems much better paced and most of all not as problematic, Temple of Doom is the fucking one with the minecart scene, and that scene fucking slaps. It's the one with the rope bridge, and that scene fucking slaps. It's the one with a continuously pissed off Indiana Jones, which also... slaps. Not to mention that Shorty is supercute and Ken Huy Quan a super-fucking-charismatic boy who truly shines brightly here.\n\nThe main issue of the film stems from similar reasons as why many people hate it merely for it coming off, and at times being, problematic. I don't believe that White Savior is an entirely fair criticism given the nature of Indiana Jones being about an adventurer - what the fuck is he supposed to do? Would it be better if he was not white? But of course, that is in theory, and in reality white savior depictions inform minds of viewers and it wouldn't be that hard to just have him interact with people living in that place to a degree that they educate him and save him too.\n\nIn fact, Indiana Jones' sidekicks being educated about cultural differences would have SLAPPED and helped all of the films to let go of that faint taste of US-western being the normal. Clearly it's no secret that Indians do in fact not eat monkey brains or living snakes. Clearly, too, this film depicts a completely fabricated voodoo-insane-tyranny cult and that dinner scene was retrospectively meant as a big warning sign. But instead of even considering to view it that way, people pull the racist card. Why is that? Well, because for some reason unbeknownst to earth, Spielberg's team decided to not even talk about it one second. Why? To not give the secret away, probably. Mostly for campy, funny fun reasons. It's a blunder, that gets a bit blown out of proportion.\n\nPrecisely like how Willie is the most stereotypical idea of a woman a misogynist would have, while she's ALSO just funny, relatable for people who don't just wad through a sea of insects, and an amazingly fitting sidekick for guy like Indiana Jones. Especially after Karen Allen being a kick-ass badass just like him, only much less of an (endearing) asshole. The Indian tribe being helpless and all that is understandable, not everyone is Indiana Jones and just walks towards someone with obvious ill intent. This again would have been remedied by someone helping them, even by them meeting another tribe that's kicking ass, or, hell, by having the whole film be set and begin in India, delving a bit more into that culture, as much as that would have made Shorty's appearance totally random. Not gonna lie, if I would have been a screenwriter, I would have probably proposed to Spielberg to have a native boy from the helpless tribe be super-adventurous and just tag along to help them. He would have probably known something's off at the cult's place and given the otherwise somewhat faceless slave children a bit more emotional punch.\n\nBut it's okay because I fucking love Ke Huy Quan and he's such a sweet boy and amazing person. Not to mention that it's also nice to have some diversity in films that are about cultural differences, even if he mentions lucky cookies that are afaik basically not a thing in nearly all corners of China. Though I am a bit bummed given how the idea of Thuggees and all that jazz is (after my pathetically short research) an idea that had been spread by British colonists, also something that could have easily been depicted a bit differently by just inventing a tribe that, yes, turns out to be evil worshippers of a Hindu goddess, because why not. And I would definitely have liked to see some Delhi action, this film could have been much longer.\n\nThese things do not have to hurt the film's enjoyment as much as it seems to, for many, because even if you view it in the greater picture of how people are informed by the media they watch, you also simply have to view it from the individual one of a film that has no ill intent and instead just wants to tell a plea against tyranny, for justice, and most of all, for helping people in need, for a looooot of adventure and fun. That's a fundamental question though, I guess, that, and that is NOT really something you can easily deny, people these days have more problems than in the past decades: to just enjoy something while also acknowledging its fault.\n\nAnd boy is there a lot to enjoy here. The film feels short, has not a lot of settings, but it's great for the character of Indiana Jones to be sweaty and pissed off 24/7 and that alone is just some damn fun. Thsi being so damn dark and gory for a Spielberg film. My boy Shorty screaming \"take the left\" while Indy doesn't give a fuck just days after Shorty fucks up with the trap room (bruh). How he went onto the bridge and you already knew that shit's gonna crash down. \"WE ARE GOING TO DIE.\" I don't care about the fact how this film seems worse structured (or rather, way more simple) than Raiders because the final 40 minutes are so fucking awesome and give the series a few of their best moments. Just great. Pure campy fun. &gt;!If it weren't for Crystal Skull, this would be the most underrated of all the Indiana Jones films (please don't kill me).!&lt;",

        "text": "Obviously EEAAO has been a dynamo this year, so it’s not surprise there have been countless articles and discussions about the themes this film explores. However, I haven’t really seen anyone discuss one major issue I had with the film and it made me wonder if that was because it was my misunderstanding of the film. I was wondering if you all could help me gain a better understanding and hopefully a better appreciation.\n\nI really enjoyed the movie. It’s very well crafted. However I think both of its themes directly contradict each other. On one hand you have the nihilistic worldview it explores, and in the conclusion of the film, the message (or at least my understanding of it) is that “nothing matters, so let’s make the most of the moments we have together.”\n\nOn the other hand, this movie explores the idea of generational trauma and the affect it can have on one’s mental state. In my opinion, the existence of this theme directly negates the nihilistic worldview the movie settles on. If your actions can ripple through your family in a negative way and wreak havoc on the mental state of your loved ones, your actions DO matter, and in order to counteract this, you must act with purpose and precision towards those you care about.\n\nIdk, maybe this is my misunderstanding of nihilism Itself. Or simply my misunderstanding of what the movie was trying to say. But I just don’t think the conclusion the characters come to is accurate put next to the themes of generational trauma.",

        "text": "I’ve seen this film a number of times but one recent film analysis kind of just blew mind a bit and needed to eye.\n\nFirst the analogies in this film, I love the blend of Cosmic and deeply personal we’re what made this film special but one big thing had never stuck out to me : and that was the Yin and Yang dichotomy of the Everything Bagel and the Googly Eye, and it made me fall even more deeply in love with this film.\n\nMichelle Yeohs Variant Daughter shows her her creation : The Everything Bagel. A sort of black hole singulariaty that was generated when she actually put everything in existence on a bagel. The Bagel represents the daughters “Black Pilled” acceptance of utter despair.\n\nThe everything Bagel are those bad thoughts we all have where we think everything we’ve ever done in our lives is a non sum, and in fact worthless. A black hole. It’s a way of actually looking at life.\n\n\nEarlier in the film we see the Googly eye, which Michelle’s husband constantly leaves around, annoying her to no end for it’s pointless childishnessnajd yet another thing to have to clean up.\n\nIt’s not until later Michelle’s have the earth shattering epiphany that she has not appreciated her husband for his good heart. She realizes it’s her husbands ways of seeing the world through a prism of optimism and love and altering the world just so to make it slightly warmer, human place.\n\nIn the end Michelle dons the Googly eye as the “Open Third eye” as a symbol of finally understanding her husbands love for her and alligning on the side of optimism over nihilism and that love wins despite any circumstance.\n\nThe fact that the Googly Eye and the Everything Bagel represent diametric opposite of out looks but also are exactly a visual inverse (White circle black whole, Black Circle White hole) is so incredible it BLEW MY MIND, when I realized it. It’s an entire life philosophy wrapped up in the most simply childlike package. I feel like I need to get stickers or a shirt made of the the two symbols side by side because it’s so compelling.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/11swnx6/discussion_of_the_movie_her_in_an_aesthetic_sense/",
        "text": "In an article by Jan Teurling titled, \"Social Media and the New Commons of TV Criticism\", there was a term that stood out called **aesthetic criticism**, in which refers to a mode of criticism that focuses on the formal and artistic qualities like a film's narrative and character development.\n\nIt reminded me of a film (Her) that I heavily enjoyed and still remains one of my top 5 films of all time, simply due to the intricate storytelling that tackled on relationship dynamics and humanizing of AI.\n\n**Character Development**\n\nJoaquin Phoenix's acting was sublime, with the ability to bring out such raw emotions with Theodore as a character is simply amazing. In the film, you can evidently see the stages of character development of Theodore, with or without the existence of Samantha (the AI). However, Samantha is seen as the key for Theodore to open up and accept his divorce, and as Samantha is introduced, Theodore's character, a lonely and introverted man can be seen shifting to a brighter personality, a more carefree and nonchalant Theodore. Note that he felt so comfortable with Samantha, he completely gave up in trying to look \"normal\" in society, as he often goes on adventures with Samantha, both in the virtual world and in real life, which ultimately makes him feel more connected to the world around him. The way that Theodore's character develops throughout the film does not seem that far-fetched from reality, as many people can probably see themselves in the position of  Theodore, the process of grieving a divorce/breakup and learning how to get over it by going out of your comfort zone such as going on dates, and talking to people is very applicable to real life, granted that this film does highlight potential problems with AI dating in the far future.\n\n**Narrative Development**\n\nThe film does move in a very slow pace, as it shows a gradual and nuanced exploration of love, technology and human connection. However, I do think the slow pace works out for the better, the slow pacing helps the characters in the film to portray the realistic process of human emotions in life, especially when the world in the film is so fast paced (as it is set in the far future in Los Angeles where technology is quite advanced), it also allows for more complex character development. The storytelling in the film is quite intricate, as the clever use of Mise-en-scène helps to accentuate the relationship dynamic between Theodore and Samantha, which often conveys a very warm fuzzy feeling when you watch them interact with each other. Moreover, the music accommodates the many themes of the film, as it often sounds haunting, romantic and lonely all at the same time, which reflects the emotions of Theodore really well. Rather than ending the movie with a completed, finished love story of Theodore and Samantha, the ending is more bittersweet and thought-provoking, as it suggests that even in a world where technology is becoming more intertwined with our lives, machines still have limited understanding and experience of human emotions and it teaches the importance of valuing the moments we share with each other, no matter how fleeting they may be.\n\nWhat do you think?",

Turns out I was wrong, and it did just fine critically and commercially.  More than fine, I'm pleasantly surprised we were seeing a future Oscar winner and no doubt this bought me some cred in my circle.\n\nEarlier this year, there's been press on the surprising lack of box office of Ant-Man 3, and the general lackluster reception to the Marvel films in general.  \n\nThe CEO of Disney has admitted to investors and big banking people that they're going to rethink Star Wars and Marvel stuff, maybe not be so eager to do trilogies or endless sequels, and seemingly wants to reduce their output in general.\n\nCocaine Bear, which is an original concept and not part of a cinematic universe made up of various animals on various substances, has made double its budget in theaters.  \n\nJohn Wick's fourth movie is coming soon, and the original has influenced other movies like Atomic Blonde, and also spinoffs like the upcoming Ballerina with Ana de Armas.  And all of this from a $20-30 million actioner from a first-time director and an aging star.\n\nGranted, I know I'm never going to live in a society where Chungking Express is in the top ten box office of the year.  I'm not even entirely sure I'd want to, since those are the kinds of movies you discover and treasure, and when you find other people who love them you know you've found a friend.  However, I'd like just a little variety in my cineplex.  In the cultural conversation.  During my college years a little over ten years ago (so maybe a million years in internet time), The Hangover movies were giant blockbusters.  You'd see some Apatow-universe movie and it'd get a wide release and make nine figures at the box office.  And I know that I keep harping on that, but that's what basically the studios care about these days. If they see original concepts with modest budgets make money, they might look more into that.  \n\nThings come in waves.  In the 2000s-2010s, Apatow was hot so we got to see a lot of comedies come out that still hold up.  In the 1980s, it was a lot of cop action and slashers.  I'm just hoping that superhero movies with budgets the size of the GDP of some countries, that absolutely need international box office, are on the way out.  I say bring back the comedy movie, the R-ratings for both comedy and action, non-animated kid's movies, just flat-out dramas.  (Forrest Gump was the number two movie in the box office the year it came out which seems insane these days)\n\nAnd to throw this in there, I kind of hope that streaming starts to slump as well, at least the big services.  At least online, people are grumbling about Netflix's desperate cash grabs and quick cancellations, and HBOMax sending already-made properties to the Shadow Realm, never to be seen or heard again.  If people started buying DVDs again (unlikely, but a boy can dream) that'll really help things out as well.",

Carl Anderson as Judas rocks the show with his incredible vocals. \n\nEvery Easter my dad would pop in his sacrilegious (as my grandmother called it) video of Jesus Christ Superstar. From the start, the hippie bus is trekking through the desert. Electric guitar chords set the tone as hippies unload the cross where Jesus is crucified. \n\nA wide shot narrows down to Carl Anderson belting out Heaven On Their Minds. Carl as Judas recognizes Jesus is a larger than life superstar. Rome will surely take notice and unleash their finely tuned killing machine. \n\nJudas is not the single faceted betrayer of Christ in this Andrew Lloyd Webber musical. He has depth. We see this demonstrated when Carl Anderson performs Damned For All Time. Judas feels compelled to sell out Jesus to the Pharisees. \n\nThis story is not just about the historic record of Jesus but more about the untold story of Judas. A name so shameful, nobody will name their child Judas. \n\nImma get right back to it.",

        "text": "Anyone here saying this film is cheap exploitation is just unable to admit to themselves (especially if you’re a man in a relationship with a woman and also a pregnant one at that) that this could easily happen to you too. We think we have these cushy lives but if you’re pregnant partner was brutalized in such a way wouldn’t you seek revenge as well? And if you wouldn’t then are you human? Also, for the ladies saying this is against women please also remember that it was the male who created the argument which led to said issues. \n\nUltimately this entire situation was avoidable if the male had chosen to be a better partner to his women. In a roundabout way it is his fault and he knows this which leads to his half narcissistic revenge. Noe is asking you the male viewer if you wouldn’t do the same thing in seeking revenge and to be a better person to start with to avoid the situation. If anything this film is pro feminism. \n\nThe entire film is the male partners fault. It is not chance. Alex was not just randomly walking home after work and got attacked. She a pregnant vulnerable women was separated from her man due to her man’s own actions. \n\nThe movie is actually a happy ending. The camera painstakingly changes from chaotic and confused to long shots with vibrant primary colors. It lets us know that life is both amazing and horrible at the same time. Both Ghandi and Hitler existed. \n\nI can’t understand at all why people say they would only watch this once and not recommend it. It is a brilliant piece of art. My opinion is if you can’t watch it or felt traumatic reactions then Noe is laughing at you. He’s letting you know that your life could change at any minute and the present is all the matters. If you refuse to accept this reality then of course you would hate the film.",

Watching Operation Fortune days ago I was surprised that he had made a film that I liked in a while, by this point Ritchie is not one of my favorite directors even though Lock Stock and Snatch are important in my formative years learning about Films.\n\nHe comes in hot with Lock, Stock in 98 and Snatch 2000, starts dating Madonna dude was a made man entering 2002. Of course as we all know in 2002 he made and released Swept Away, one of the worst films ever, it destroyed his two film hot streak quite frankly I feel like he never recovered that aura he had after Snatch, cool Filmmaker that makes awesome cool violent films is over, also laughable now but after Snatch he did have British Tarantino narrative going which today has become forgotten. His next film was Revolver which wasn’t bad just incredibly boring.\n\n\nHe followed that up with his most underrated picture Rocknrolla, with Terrific performances from and amazing cast felt like the proper Third film he should’ve released. The film would turn up to just a modest hit.\n\n\nThen in 2009 he would basically become a director for hire, when he made Sherlock Holmes, the film was a hit and I feel like the money from this probably convince him to just become a director for hire and make great money even if his work was subpar compared to his earlier work, in 2019 he made The Gentleman his first caper in a decade.\n\n\nOverall thoughts on him and his career.",

His Performance has all the legendary scenes and all very Quotable. Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, and Richard S. Castellano all Fantastic, even the Supporting Parts are all excellent. I feel that The Godfather is probably the only film that anyone could be nominated for an Oscar cause they are all Fantastic.\n\nIn The Godfather Part II, It is just as great as the Original. It really parallels the rise and fall of the Corleone family, how Vito Rise parallels Michael Fall from Face. Al Pacino probably gives his greatest performance in this film and really should of won the Oscar instead of Art Carney. One thing that really amaze me was the great performances of Lee Strasberg and Michael V. Gazzo, but I find It interesting that after this film, they really didn't do anything noteworthy after, Especially Michael V. Gazzo. (Though Lee Strasberg was a very influential Acting Teacher before he did The Godfather). Again, anyone could of been nominated for The Godfather, Part 2 (Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen, John Cazale as Fredo Corleone were snubbed).\n\nCoppola does a masterful job with these 2 films. He essentially made Shakespeare in a 30s gangster setting: a mixture of King Lear, Macbeth and a bit of Hamlet. The story of a good man being reduced to bloodshed.  \n\nWhat do you think of The Godfather and The Godfather Part II?",

A couple who are keenly aware this is the last time they travel as a whole family. Throughout the trip, Ana and Fernando covertly talk about their plans apart. \n\nLucia, begins the trip enthusiastically. Picking up on the content of her parents conversations, her enthusiasm slowly crumbles as she begins to process the demise of her family. Lucia’s innocence has taken a significant blow. \n\nWe as adults have to take our responsibility around children seriously.  They are paying attention. Sotomayer demonstrates this by giving us an unnerving point of view from a 10 year old child. \n\nI look forward to more cinematic experiences like this from other Chilean films.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/11s23jx/night_on_the_galactic_railroad_if_tarkovsky_made/",
        "text": "This article has a lot of film stills, if you would like a fully illustrated version click here - [https://filmofileshideout.com/archives/night-on-the-galactic-railroad-if-tarkovsky-made-an-anime/](https://filmofileshideout.com/archives/night-on-the-galactic-railroad-if-tarkovsky-made-an-anime/)\n\n What if Tarkovsky was smacked on the head by an errant boom mic and woke up thinking he was a Japanese anime director? Oh, and he also thought he was a cat. I’m guessing if these unlikely events were to transpire, he would make something like *Night on The Galactic Railroad.* What a strange, strange movie.\n\nOf course, it was not made by a bludgeoned Russian, it was made by Gisaburo Sugii in 1985. It is a philosophical and religious rumination on the nature of the universe, as discussed by blue and pink cats riding on a train bound for the end of the universe. It’s truly a melange of styles and approaches from Jodorowsky to Miyazaki, Diego Rivera to Max Ernst.\n\nI  don’t know if Sugii was intentionally emulating Tarkovsky, but his film feels similar to Tarkovsky's films in several ways. The movement is slow. Images slide steadily by and are cross-cut with looks of wonder on the protagonists’ faces. There are even languid fields of grain waving in the wind. The movie takes place in a strange space where giant expanses of empty cosmic infinity are punctuated by strange, little worlds, each with its own lesson or message to convey.  \n\nOur two protagonists are children, or should I say kittens. Kittens that talk and wear clothes. The pink one is named Campanells and the blue one is named Giovanni. I watched the subtitled version, and Campanells and Giovanni are the characters’ original names.\n\nThe two of them gaze out the window as parables unfold in front of them like dreams. The cats don’t say much, but everyone they come across seems to be a philosopher. They meet a bearded cat in a raincoat and fedora who explains to them, “I’m not sure what happiness really is. But if you keep to the true path and listen to your heart, even under terrible conditions, you can climb any mountain, no matter how high. I believe we can all reach true happiness, one step at a time.” It doesn’t have the profundity of Tarkovsky, but in its trite grade-school fashion, it is an attempt at philosophy. The noir cat is explaining this to a dripping-wet survivor from the Titanic who has suddenly appeared on board. He is the first human we see and is strangely dressed like a Mennonite. He answers the cat, “Yes. I agree. To reach true happiness we must serve God, even if we do so from the depths of our despair.”\n\nThe film has a heavy-handed Christian message. I’m not sure exactly what the message is, but in the above exchange, we have the tired, old appeal to submit to your totalitarian father in the sky, even if he is abusing you. I personally don’t know how Christians stand it. The film is full of references to the Bible and every one now and then breaks out into a hymn. \n\nNear the end, the train pulls into Heaven as Handel’s *Messiah* plays and most of the people and cats disembark, but our two kittens stay on board to see where the train goes. It gets more interesting after Heaven. The kittens start wrestling with existential dread, mixed with a kind of Buddhist idea of offering your life to serve everyone. It’s confusing, but you get utterances like, “While maintaining the light, the lamp is lost.” \n\nThe film begins with a playful sense of wonder and slowly darkens, until we are left with struggle and sadness. Sugii is searching for transcendent meaning in a combination of Buddhist selflessness, Christian obedience, and the awe of astronomy. It all comes off as superficial and ham-handed, but the efforts at philosophy mingle with beautiful visuals to render something with a memorable atmosphere and quality all its own.",

        "title": "Top 250 Films based on User Ratings Internationally",
        "author": "WG696",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/11rzytg/top_250_films_based_on_user_ratings/",
        "text": "**Context:**\n\nThis is one of those compilation rankings of multiple websites. The key feature of my compilation is that everyone's rating has the same weight. This means a fan of mass-market movies has the same weight as one of indie films. It also means your rating has the same weight as a critic's rating. In fact, I don't bother retrieving critic rating data since their numbers are insignificant relative to the total.\n\nThis list is partially in response to past compilation lists that made distortions to the data I felt like removing, such as [applying a penalty for ratings from certain countries](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/10ftydh/the_best_of_2022_based_on_imdb_letterboxd_mubi/), or [applying high weight to critics or websites with low user counts](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/ixo81z/these_are_the_statistical_top_500_movies_of_all/). That's not to say they did anything incorrect. It's just a matter of what you want the list to represent.\n\nThere is one distortion to the data that I impose. It is a penalty for low rating counts using the simplified bayesian estimation that IMDB uses. I increase the intensity of it though. We can discuss the effects of this distortion in the comments.\n\nThe sources (and proportion of total rating count) are IMDb (29%), Douban (28%), Letterboxd (16%), Kinopoisk (14%), Rotten Tomatoes (12%), Filmarks (0.3%), TMDB (0.3%) and Metacritic (0.001%). The latter 3 don't really make a big impact to the list.\n\n**Discussion:**\n\nThe result is not a list of the most innovative or historic films, though there are many of those here. If I were to describe the list in one word, it would be *\"sentimental\"*. I mean, there are two films inspired by Hachiko the dog! I think you might personally find many of the films too sappy, or too trendy, or too dated, or even too nationalistic. Nevertheless, they are films that have deeply resonated with countless people and have shaped a generation. I say a single generation, because there is clear bias toward contemporary tastes. They're the tastes of a generation growing up on the internet, recording their opinions on the internet.\n\nWhile I think the countries that produced the films on the list represent the industry landscape decently well, it doesn't represent the world. I think there are 4 groups of people that are highly under-represented, which are Arabic speakers, Spanish speakers, Indians and Nigerians. This is due to: (1) lack of online representation, and (2) global dominance of Hollywood.\n\nRegarding (1), even if new sites from other countries are added like FilmAffinity for Spanish speakers, the list won't change dramatically because the sites wouldn't be close in size to the major ones already included. Unfortunately, there is an inequality of internet presence in the world that impacts this list. Indian presence has been growing on Rotten Tomatoes and IMDB in the past couple years so I'm optimistic about the future. I am continually working on retrieving data from other sites even if their impact is minimal for now.\n\nRegarding (2), even when we look at international sites like FilmAffinity, there is huge bias in ratings toward Hollywood. This is especially true for Western sites. In FilmAffinity's top rankings for example, there are only a handful of Spanish language films, and most of them have far fewer ratings than Hollywood films.\n\nI'd be interested in your thoughts of the films here that don't typically appear on English top ranking lists.

The main points are that data retrieval was mostly from automated web scraping and that I used a statistically rigorous method to translate all ratings to the Letterboxd scale. ([ref](https://imgur.com/a/0g7MekA))\n\n\n**Assumption:** It's assumed that the number of people rating films on multiple websites at once is insignificant. It's possible to estimate overlap, but I don't think it's worth the effort.\n\n[letterboxd list](https://boxd.it/1D4Ji)",

        "text": "Recently, I saw the movie, Boyz In The Hood, and Officer Coffey is among some of the more interesting minor antagonists I've seen in a film in a while, mainly because of how he contrasts with his white police coworker and what he represents. In a way, he is like the house negro of the film. Not in the literal sense but in the sense that he is someone in a position of power that is discriminatory of black people and gives him the privileges of the white cop by not being the black man who gets shot by the police but the one with the gun and the police department on his side. I would say he also represents this mentality that a few black folks have for other black folks: as criminals and as being high on their violence. That as believing themselves to not be the ones falling for what these man fell on and that they should exterminate them for being the \"thugs\" that they are. He sees their violence and regression not as a symptom of the poverty and systemic racism affecting the black community but as their moral failing and as born killers who matter less than nothing. If he was portrayed as a white cop, he would admittedly been more boring and just another many of the examples of the racist cop but I think making him a self-racist black cop, it creates a fascinating commentary about how racism can become prevalent even among minorities and still be part of a system that oppressed them. Plus, the scenes where you hear him refer to black criminals as \"niggers\" is just uncomfortable in a effective way and can get very tense when he threatens the main character into killing him when he hasn't done anything wrong.",

        "text": " lately  i have been a litte obsessed with new advancements in the field of  computing technologies, so i thought about looking back on one of the  classic as i got the opportunity to finally see it on the big screen.\n\nwhat  interests me is the artificiality aspect and how it impacts the viewer.  how the director sets to intertwine what is fake and what is not. on  the silver screen, everything is ultimately lifeless, a mere image of  what is real but yet it can feel to us more real than reality itself. it  can wield an itensity that will lead us, always, to come back and want  to be involved in the narrative. to forget that things are not but that  they can be. that for some fleeting hours we can reach that place where  immersed in the story the shadows that inhabits it makes us feel more  alive than we were out there.\n\ndavid  is a fake child, coming to this weird house that is like a stage.  seemingly far away from the world and bathed in diaphanous lights.  protected in an all seemingly artificial love. he is introduced to us  through vague halo or shattered mirrors. silver planes within the frame.  it is only when martin, the real child, comes back that we eventually  have the scope becoming a little larger. but then again it's only for  him to end at the bottom of a pool that has taken the entirety of the  screen. leaving him alone behind this veil of shifting dreams.  eventually, his mother too fits in a mirror. she feels like something  else. eternal for an instant. and it will be her last memory of him, a  fading shadow, stuck like a bird in the nest, in the rearview glass of  her whale sounding car. unable to escape as she abandons him to a world  she spoke to him nothign about.\n\nhe  never will nor wants to grow. when his frend the sex toy joe tells him  about his issues, david furiously refuses to hear any of it. a glimpse  of violence can even be seen in his unblinking eyes. not so long ago,  that same funny character, full of stereotypical charm, was dancing  before him under the moonlight, going from the forefront of the scene to  the back where only his silouhette survived. and the moon, they were  afraid of it. they did not know if it was dangerous or not. they already  had been tricked once. yet to find the blue fairy, the most real thing  in david's eyes, they none the less go towards it, like actors indeed go  toward the lights of the projectors and play out something else from  themselves. always under the cold embrace of the moon, gleaming without  end and fabricating heir dreams.\n\nfinally,  after david has seen it all. after he saw through himself and broke  down, threw himself in the vast ocean where the man made city's dead  body too lies still. then, all that is left is artificial. we have not  seen anything human in a while. but what happened in the meantime is  that, much like the audience at the destruction fair would stand up to  protect him, we came to see him as a real child. this actor that is a  child playing a robot wanting to be real. becoming a tear on the face of  another artificial being as if it was the most he could ever be. we all  wanted him to be so real, for his story to make sense, we wanted to be  fooled. we wanted to see his dreams come true. and it does, when he is  all alone, in a fantasy he wished to be created for him, only them is  the truly real ! through those couples of hours we let ourselves sink  into this world where robots, even the most difformed ones, seems to  possess a soul, where we feel pain when they are hurted. and so in the  last moments, like the machines from eons after the death of humanity,  we look to the silver screen, in between reflection, as the scene  unfold, as his dream has benn realized and the light ... goes out.\n\nwe all go back to that \"place the dreams are made off\".\n\nPOSTFACE\n\nthis movie does bring up so many questions xD\n\nbeside  the film in itslef, i was struck out how relevant it was to recent  events. it resonnated extremely well with the actuality surrounding  generative ai chatbots, to the point where some scene in the movie of  david breaking down actually is something that has been seen on the web,  in real life. people talked to them, they got engaged and for them it  was real. and maybe when you turn off your computer and go out, do the  things you do, you will have a thought, you will be enaged in that  thought. it will become the seed on which you build your tree house. it  was not real before it was real to you.",

        "text": "I just watched Tár yesterday, and thought that the writing, acting and cinematography were all superb, but I definitely struggled(and continue to struggle) with it’s themes. \nI firstly need to confess that I am a professional classical musician, so there are elements of the film that could never feel 100% genuine to me, but I try to avoid that bias while watching and assessing. (I had a similar issue with “Three Colors: Blue”, although I still found the film itself amazing)\n\n\nI’ve read many discussions about Tar here on Reddit, and understand that there’s an intended level of ambiguity. However, I guess my contention is that some of this ambiguity is actually contradictory in a way that betrays the film’s themes. \n\nOne of the main debates inspired by the film is the phenomenon of “cancel culture”, with some reviewers seeing it as a condemnation, while others as a righteous comeuppance. \nMy problem with the film is this: it’s clear that Lydia Tar has abused her power. This is evident from the \n\n-short POVs we get from her assistant Francesca\n\n-the rush to delete the emails at the very news of Krista’s suicide. \n\n-the entire episode with the cellist Olga\n\n-the clear guilt Tar feels when we see her alone grappling with nightmares, along with real or perceived appearances of Krista’s ghost\n\n-her firing from the orchestra (I strongly believe that the first female conductor of the Berlin Philharmonic would never be dismissed without VERY compelling evidence.) \n\n\nAll of this points to the idea that Tár SHOULD be canceled, yet I simultaneously feel that the film consciously criticizes and undermines the “cancel-culture” that delivers her deserved comeuppance. For example:\n\n-the heavily edited, farcical video of the Julliard Masterclass interaction\n\n-the portrayal of the protestors as rabid (admittedly this could just be her POV)\n\n-her rejection of the exploitable masseuse towards the end of the film \n\n-the film never explicitly reveals her misdeeds, leading many viewers(definitely not all)to the conclusion that she was unjustly fired. \n\nMy opinion is in no way the objective truth about the film, but my personal understanding of the content left me puzzled. I just wanted to maybe try to spark some discussion since I didn’t love Tár, but clearly can’t seem to take my mind off it!",

He is well spoken, stresses the importance of education in Rocky (1976) and shows respect for his community with a stable marriage to his wife.\n\nNot only that but once he is beaten, he helpfully takes on traits of “the magical negro” identified by Spike Lee. Apollo sacrifices his time and effort to help his former white rival win, for little reward except a “favour”, that turns out to be a friendly exhibition bout. His competitiveness is thus harmlessly distilled away.\n\nClubber Lang is a very difference image of the black male. He is solidarity (unlike Creed’s communal outlook) and is laconic (in contrast to Creed’s verbose charisma).\n\nInstead of the respectful competitor, Lang is first and foremost a threat (one that Mickey but not Rocky immediately realises through watching Lang’s matches). \n\nIt is only when Lang makes a sexual advance on Rocky’s wife Adrian that Balboa is goaded into giving a match to Lang. Importantly, Lang shows nothing but contempt to the statesman Apollo Creed referring to him as “Apollo Who?” and the benign image of blackness that Creed represents.",

But now that’s it’s officially dominated the awards season I’d better throw this out quick before it’s relevance fades. \n\nAll of the science fiction multiverse elements were in Evelyn’s head, right? The bulk of the film is her daydreaming on possibly the most stressful day of her life and procrastinating on the overwhelming issues at hand. We’ve all had days where we’ve wondered how we got to this shitty point and what if we’d done something different back in the day, this film shows us how one person may process those feelings as well as trying to manage her complicated relationship with her daughter. \n\nYou can’t expect me to take seriously the notion that there is a universe technologically identical to ours except we have sausage fingers. Or that there is a universe where Evelyn and Joy are sentient rocks that still happen to be related / in proximity to one another. But I do believe she’s watched a number of Jackie Chan / Wong Kar Wai movies and they can influence her imagination. \n\nAnd then there is the everything bagel where nothing really matters. To me, this is the film winking at me by saying that all of this *gestures at wacky action inspired by other well regarded films* doesn’t really matter as it’s not real. What DOES matter is Evelyn getting her shit together with her life and family. Besides, it wouldn’t be the first time the Daniels pulled this kind of storytelling technique. \n\nI bring this up to ask if anyone else viewed the film this way, as almost all of the Reddit / media website discourse is about which universe they ended up in and I guess I’m looking for anonymous online vindication?",

Cinematographers like Gregg Toland and Roger Deakins are praised for their composition skills and camera techniques (deep focus in ‘Citizen Kane’, for instance). Yet time and again, I see directors praised for ‘their’ camera movements (Spielberg’s ‘Jaws’ zoom). How do we distinguish between direction and cinematography? Who ought we to praise when we enjoy a film’s visual technique? What makes something an achievement in cinematography rather than an achievement in direction?",

        "text": "**TL; DR:**  \nDo you believe a better system is needed, or are you happy with the Oscars; or, indeed, do you already know of a better awards system (either formal or informal)?  \n\n\n**Intro**  \nSince this Sub-Reddit does not allow polls, I cannot create a simple voting system for Best Picture or such of the ilk, for the top movies of any given year, which I think would be a decent way to judge such things -- assuming we had a fair number of voters and everybody had properly judged the movies. The next best thing might be a Discord/Twitter voting system of some kind, or to simply go direct to a movie-rating website and create a digital awards system, like a more in-depth version of the generic 10/10 rating system for movies, and then let all users of said website vote.\n\nTechnically, if we just wanted public opinion, we would factor in (a) average rating across all major movie-rating websites; (b) box office total profits; and (c) general popularity. But, this is flawed for a few reasons, and falls prey to mere 'hype', among other things. This would simply be the 'Most Popular' award, which the Oscars were actually considering at one point!\n\nOn the other hand, each person can hold their own view -- that's each man having his own awards show, which is beyond insanity. Of course, my show actually would have given Best Picture to *King Kong (1933), Rear Window (1954), Psycho (1960), The Shining (1980), Full Metal Jacket (1987), The Fellowship of the Ring (2001),* and *The Dark Knight (2008)*, to name a few. Needless to say, that is not how history turned out, even slightly.\n\nNote: Take a look at [this list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Academy_Award-winning_films) of Oscar winners, because it's very important to fully understand this post.\n\nIf you know my feelings on the Oscars and its false classiness -- that is, under its own rubric, as it purports -- then you know why I have this burning desire for something better; if you don't know my feelings on the Oscars, then feel free to read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/TDLH/comments/11qabu8/oscars_a_deeper_look_at_what_won_what_should_have/).  \n\n\n**What's in a Picture?**  \nI'm just interested in the Best Picture award only, for a few reasons, or what I shall coin Greatest Picture (I know, that leap took *a lot* of imagination). Simply, this means the best movie of the year, overall (or, as a totality, so far as such is possible -- which is not uncommon, looking at the Oscars' history. Most winners of Best Picture also won at least three other Oscars, if not closer to ten (out of seventeen possible awards for a single movie)). \n\nIn theory, the 'Greatest Picture' award ought to be given the movie that has (a) the most well-rounded, deep story; (b) the most pristine and well-polished overall production; and (c) the most uniform and classy overall style and presentation. That is what the Oscars aim -- or claim to aim -- for, and is the very reason why they rarely pay any attention to monster movies, horrors, fantasy pieces, sci-fi, CGI-heavy movies, animations, or anything else you can think of that does not neatly fit within the classic Academy standard.\n\nHere's the rub: I could actually stand by their right and decision, even if I still seriously disagree with it, if they remained even remotely consistent, fair, and objective with regards to both their voting habits and selection pools any given year, let alone decade. The reality is, they routinely find themselves lost in the woods without any hope of getting back on track. They claim to hate superheroes, yet they go right ahead and award *Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse (2018)*, which is a superhero, sci-fi animation all in one! It's also not as serious as they like and much more child-friendly (which they generally dislike, as well).  \nI don't know their internal mechanisms in terms of how they even decide what is allowed to be nominated or what has to be (such as to fill a category), but I don't have to: they should either be very clear and strict in what they decide to nominate, or they should allow all movies to be nominated equally (or, if they require a smaller selection pool, then they could create some kind of voting system to determine the top 500 movies that year). As it stands, there are between 50 and 300 movies nominated at the Oscars any given year out of at least 1,000 mainstream American movies each year, on average (100-200 of these out of Hollywood itself), and far more non-mainstream and non-American movies. Slow years still see around 600 American movies each year.\n\nYou have to at least try and consider them all, if you are already in the habit of throwing away your own rules and standards whenever you feel like it.\n\nI do not believe this is such an impossible task for them, given that they have one whole year to study the movies across almost 9,000 members, largely contained tot heir own branch, some of which are actually contradictory under Oscar rulings. This means, each member only has to watch about four movies per week (200 for the year). Best Picture is different, however. This is already a tiny pool (10 movies or fewer, that are already pre-selected by the seems of it), and all 9,000 (ish) members are allowed to vote for this category. Alas, Best Picture is regarded as the greatest award in the world for cinema, so it is certainly not to be taken lightly. As a result, however, there should be many more nominations for Best Picture (though I don't have a problem with their voting system and voter pool in this case). The selection pool is the problem.\n\nMaybe it's not such a wise idea to out-right snub *The Shining (1980)* or *Psycho (1960)* or *Return of the Jedi (1983)*, and to only consider 300 movies per year and 5-10 for Best Picture, whilst completely omitting some of the best -- or else, refusing to gift them more nomination opportunities in the first place. Then, even when they are nominated, many of them lose, firmly. This makes me question the motives and thought processes of the 9,000 members of the group. Surely, it only takes one high-powered member of the Academy to stand up and say, '*You know, I just saw The Shining last night, and it is a masterpiece. We must consider it for nomination, at least it should be given a fair and equal chance for Best Picture, Best Supporting Actress, Best Actor, Best Director, and Best Adapted Screenplay'*.   \n\n\n**The Issue**  \nSome people claim that the Oscars typically award by pure bias to the most popular or high-grossing movies of that year, but this is evidently false. If that were the case, Best Picture would go to all sorts of massive hits that were not actually great movies. This year, the Oscars went to an indie movie that hardly broke 100 million globally. Compare that to *Top Gun: Maverick (2022)*, one of the biggest hits in American history, earning 700 million within the States and 1.5 billion globally, and if often said to have saved Hollywood (it won Best Sound, which is likely to be a mere hand-out to keep the public silent), or *Avatar: The Way of Water (2022)*, which is currently at around 2.2 billion -- yet it won nothing at all, other than Best Visual Effects, just like the first Avatar. We can say much about the Oscars, but we cannot say they purely vote in line with raw popularity or profits.\n\nOf course, *that's* not the issue. The issue is how to actually create an alterative system. Ideally, Greatest Picture would be a relativistic system, judged by voters, individually, across ten overarching metrics, which are rank-ordered. A final score is tallied and run through a basic analysis to compare scores and entries; thus, determining the winner (in the event of a tie, a simple preferential voting system would be used, such as they use for Best Picture at the Oscars).\n\nTo climb down from 1,000 movies to the desired 500 or whatever the case may be, a preferential voting system would be used (though, before this stage, the selection pool can be formulated if certain movies fail to meet the standards to be entered in the first place, though I believe it's best if this is kept to a minimum, because the voting system takes care of these. This, meaning they are likely to be scored low by the average voter, ensuring they fall outside the 500 pool. The clear negative could be that a highly-voted movie ends in 501st place. That's why it's a good idea to try and avoid such issues in the first place by widening the selection pool, and letting everybody vote on all entries equally). \n\nIt's clear that the Oscars already use a system like this, only theirs is extremely biased and unfair as to meet their own particular standards, such as out-right rejecting consideration of most fantasy, sci-fi, superhero/comic, monster, and horror movies before the voting process even begins. For example, I believe *The Dark Knight (2008)* was not allowed to be nominated for Best Picture. Why? Only two reasons. They were either scared it would win, or simply did not consider it worthy of being allowed to win, because they believe that a superhero movie can never be Best Picture. Actually, both of those options are deeply connected, though different. I cannot claim that *The Dark Knight (2008)* should have won Best Picture, but I believe I can claim that it should have been allowed to be nominated in the first place -- then the voters would decide whether it actually deserved to win or not, irrespective of the genre or otherwise.",

As someone described them, they're somehow about nothing and yet everything at the same time. They're often very raw and honest, and the earlier movies tend to explore Gen X people searching for meaning.\n\nHave you ever seen or know of any noteworthy mumblecore works outside of the United States?\n\n**What are your thoughts on mumblecore cinema in general?

        "text": "This post will be a continuation of my exploration into the kinds of foreign movies that Seoul residents might have watched in 1943, when Imperial Japan was in the middle of a desperate war. To mark exactly 80 years since February and March 1943, I scanned the Keijo Nippo newspapers for any movie ads for foreign films that were showing at movie theaters in Seoul for those months. I identified the movies based on the Japanese titles as well as clues left in the ads themselves, like the plot lines and the names of the directors and actors. As you can see, the vast majority of the foreign movies were produced in Germany, with just one French film that was not a German co-production. Kora Terry (1940), a German spy thriller, and Wunschkonzert (1940), a German propaganda musical, make their appearance again after being screened in January 1943.\n\nForeign movies shown in February 1943:\n\n* [Verklungene Melodie](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0030930/) (Germany, 1938)\n* [Sieben Ohrfeigen](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0029559/) (Germany, 1937)\n* [Manege](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0132302/)  (Germany, 1937)\n* [Kora Terry](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0032677/) (Germany, 1940)\n* [L'Equipage](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0019614/?ref_=nm_flmg_c_2_act) (France, 1928)\n\nForeign movies shown in March 1943:\n\n* [Adrienne Lecouvreur](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0202210/) (France/Germany, 1938)\n* [Heimat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heimat_(1938_film)) (Germany, 1938)\n* [Streit um den Knaben Jo](https://en.kinorium.com/27978/) (Germany, 1937)\n* [Kora Terry](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0032677/) (Germany, 1940)\n* [Wunschkonzert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wunschkonzert) (Germany, 1940)\n\n**Let's take a look at the foreign movies which were screened in February 1943:**\n\n[Verklungene Melodie](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0030930/) (Dead Melody) was a 1938 German romantic comedy starring [Brigitte Horney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brigitte_Horney) and [Willy Birgel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willy_Birgel), who are depicted in the movie ad. The movie was showing from February 1st to the 3rd. It was a double feature with the Japanese domestic film [新たなる幸福](https://www.shochiku.co.jp/cinema/database/02324/) which you had to watch if you wanted to watch the foreign film.\n\n[Sieben Ohrfeigen](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0029559/) (Seven Slaps) was a 1937 German romantic comedy starring [Lilian Harvey](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0367613/?ref_=tt_ov_st) and [Willy Fritsch](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0295992/?ref_=tt_ov_st), who are depicted in the movie ad. The movie was showing from February 4th to the 7th. It was a double feature with the Japanese domestic film [南進女性](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%8D%97%E9%80%B2%E5%A5%B3%E6%80%A7).\n\n[Kora Terry](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0032677/) (1940) was a spy thriller starring [Marika Rökk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marika_R%C3%B6kk) (pictured in these ads) who is depicted in this ad. It screened in January 1943, and it continued to be screened into February and March. Unlike most of the other foreign films, it was screened as a standalone feature rather than as a double feature. Two German brochures for this movie are available on the Internet Archive [here](https://archive.org/details/koraterry0000dasp) and [here](https://archive.org/details/koraterry0000illu).\n\n[Manege](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0132302/) was a 1937 German romantic comedy about a trapeze artist who tries to exact revenge on his cheating wife, starring [Anneliese Uhlig](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0880210/?ref_=tt_ov_st) and [Albert Matterstock](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0559832/), who are depicted in the movie ad. It was a standalone feature which screened from February 11 to 13.  \n\n[L'Equipage](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0019614/?ref_=nm_flmg_c_2_act) was a 1928 French aviation drama showing from February 2nd to the 4th. No foreign actors are depicted in the movie ad, and only some rough pictures of airplanes hint at the movie's content. It was a double feature with the Japanese domestic film [女学生記](https://youtu.be/hxZdBIIUP18). \n\n**Let's take a look at the foreign movies which were screened in March 1943:**\n\n[Adrienne Lecouvreur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrienne_Lecouvreur_(film)) was a 1938 French-German historical romantic drama that had a French director, [Marcel L'Herbier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel_L%27Herbier), and starred [Yvonne Printemps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yvonne_Printemps) and [Pierre Fresnay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Fresnay), who are depicted in the movie ad. It was co-produced by France and Germany. This was a double feature with an Imperial Japanese war propaganda documentary, [戦線二万キロ](https://youtu.be/CYB8wnj39R0), screened from March 9th to 11th to mark the March 10th [anniversary](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E9%99%B8%E8%BB%8D%E8%A8%98%E5%BF%B5%E6%97%A5) of Imperial Japan's victory over Russia in the Russo-Japanese War of 1905.  \n\n[Heimat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heimat_(1938_film)) (Homeland) was a 1938 German historical drama film starring [Zarah Leander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zarah_Leander), who is depicted in the movie ad. It was a double feature with an Imperial Japanese war documentary film [勝利の基礎](https://filmarks.com/movies/16280), screened from March 14th to 16th. \n\n[Streit um den Knaben Jo](https://en.kinorium.com/27978/) (Strife over the Boy Jo) was a 1937 German family comedy starring [Lil Dagover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lil_Dagover), [Mária Tasnádi Fekete](https://en.kinorium.com/name/637551/), and child actor [Klaus Detlef Sierck](https://en.kinorium.com/name/597928/), who are depicted in the movie ad. This film screened as a standalone feature from March 1st to the 3rd. The full movie is available on Youtube with no subtitles ([link](https://youtu.be/XJNCRAIzcR0)). \n\n[Wunschkonzert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wunschkonzert) (1940) was a German drama propaganda film starring [Ilse Werner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilse_Werner), who is prominently featured on the ads. This movie was apparently heavily promoted in Keijo Nippo, since its ads come up the most frequently among the foreign films advertised on Keijo Nippo, and it screened at least in both January and March of 1943. It started screening again on March 17th, with no indication on when it will end screening. The German brochure for this movie is available on the Internet Archive [here](https://archive.org/details/wunschkonzert0000illu). The full movie (no subtitles) is available on the Internet Archive [here](https://archive.org/details/wunschkonzert-d-1940-spielfilm-you-tube).

Probably similarly naive, but how do we think one OUTSIDE OF THE FILMS PRODUCTION should determine if a film is well edited?\n\n I am not asking what makes a film well edited — I feel I have a pretty good understanding of that — but I wonder how a voting public made up of predominately NOT film editors and almost entirely of people unrelated to the films production is supposed to intuit the quality of a film’s editing without access to the process. Could a film not seem well edited and yet the editor has actually discarded even better takes all along? The same way Best Picture and Directing are highly correlated, is Directing and Film Editing commonly in lockstep as well? \n\nIt seems to me one the hardest Oscar category to vote on. Actors know another actors good acting. People can objectively rate cinematographic quality. But without access to the source materials, I don’t understand how I’m supposed to know how good a job an editor did, only how good the final product is.",

It’s a cinematic achievement that will stand the test of time.\n\nWhereas Everything Everywhere at Once is simple proclamations + karate + multiverse.\n\nAbout Everything Everywhere All at Once, The New Yorker’s Richard Brody said it best: \n\n“With its bland and faux-universal life lessons that cheaply ethicalize expensive sensationalism, the film comes off as a sickly cynical feature-length directorial pitch reel for a Marvel movie.”\n\nTAR does no such hand holding. It’s a smart, complicated movie, that deals with a complicated world. I love what AO Scott has to say:\n\n“It invites you to think hard about Lydia, about the meaning of her work and the consequences of her actions, about whether she is someone you should admire or revile, about whether artists should be judged by their work or by how they live their lives. In different contexts, Lydia herself argues both sides of that question, as many of us do, and to search the movie for a consistent argument is to miss the point and fall into a category error, misconstruing the extraordinary coup that Field and Blanchett have pulled off. We don’t care about Lydia Tár because she’s an artist; we care about her because she’s art.”",

I do not view the ending as a fall from grace or a humiliation I can see that angle, and maybe it’s playing a small role, but to me it’s actually more uplifting. The brief scenes we see her preparing with the youth orchestra on the monster hunter music we see her very much in her element. She could’ve showed up and just phoned it in, but that’s not what happens. We see her with the same level of enthusiasm as when she was in Berlin working on the 5th symphony. She is honoring the music and seems to carry that same reverence for conducting no matter the audience or music. I think the scene with her returning to her childhood home and her watching the Bernstein tape validates this as well. He talks about this compulsion for music, this sort of innate desire for it. The most vulnerable we see the title character is her at the family home she tried to forget taking in the words of her idol. I view the ending as a one of redemption.",

        "text": " This article contains a lot of film stills. For a fully illustrated version please click here - [https://filmofileshideout.com/archives/abbas-kiarostamis-early-documentary-first-graders/](https://filmofileshideout.com/archives/abbas-kiarostamis-early-documentary-first-graders/)\n\nAbbas Kiarostami’s documentary film *First Graders* is irresistible. It’s simple and straightforward, but it grabs hold of you and doesn’t let go. Kiarostami is a master of simplicity. He knows that stories can arise from tiny, seemingly insignificant moments. In the film, a child loses his orange plastic cup and it is enough to completely engross the viewer. It isn’t a dire situation, but the child is scared that his mother will yell at him and you can see he is ashamed. His desperation draws you in and before you know it, you are engrossed in the saga of the orange plastic cup.\n\nThe film is little more than a series of minor problems being presented by children to the principal of the school. Kiarostami doesn’t bother with narration or inter-titles. We don’t know anything about the school or the teachers, he simply focuses on the children and the principal as they all try to get through the day.\n\nAbout half the film is spent in the principal’s office. The camera is placed behind the principal’s chair, so we share his point of view as each child delivers his testimony. They mumble, bow their heads, sniffle, and shuffle their feet as they try to summon the courage to speak. It feels a little like Kurosawa’s ***Rashomon*** where the petitioner or witness testifies directly to the audience, leaving the audience to decide what to do. How to address these children and help them navigate the schoolyard falls on us, but then the principal steps in and we have to evaluate his response.\n\nThe principal is certainly gentle. He gives them his full attention, but he also requires that the children speak up and look him in the face. After witnessing several encounters, it seems that each meeting is more about fostering the courage to stand up and speak the truth than the specifics of whatever happened. This, in and of itself, can be a useful lesson. By standing in front of the principal and pronouncing your mistake or misbehavior, you have to own it. Admitting loud and clear that you hit someone is a punishment in itself. In the heat of a fight, misdeeds can be rationalized, but in the principal's office, having to clearly admit your transgression can foster self-awareness.\n\nThere is a seriousness and gravity to every story, but there is humor too. The first altercation is between two boys in the back of a line. The principal asks, “What are you doing back there?”, and one of the boys answers, “Spitting on each other”, in a perfectly matter-of-fact tone.\n\nEach boy that presents himself in the film (they are all boys, it’s a boys' school) opens our hearts, and we must watch as he faces the consequences of his actions. The school has a set of rules for conflict. If someone insults or hits you, you must tell him that he has done wrong. Then, you ask for an apology. If he apologizes then, you must forgive him. If he does not apologize, you should report his behavior to the principal.\n\nThe principal doesn’t punish the children, but he makes them face what they have done and promise not to do it again. If they repeat the behavior, the principal gets more stern and may even threaten to expel the student, but during the film, we never see him actually do so.\n\nIt could be argued that the principal oversimplifies each altercation and does not consider all that went into what caused it. He is more concerned with what a given child does and less concerned with why they did it, or how they felt. In his favor, he does often ask why a child did what they did, but they never have an answer. First graders are not particularly in touch with their inner motivations or emotional states. The principal gets them to face the situation and then tries to foster a sense of appropriate and measured justice.\n\nIn the end, it doesn’t matter if you approve or disapprove of how the children are handled by the school. The heart of the film is about confession, truth, punishment, and redemption. The film was made in 1984, only 5 years after the revolution in Iran. Both during and after the revolution, thousands of people were subjected to torture, forced confession, and imprisonment. The painful and frightening encounters with authority that these children undergo are clearly a means to examine power and coercion, and how they affect our sense of self.\n\n*First Graders* was one in a series of films Kiarostami made when he worked at the institute he helped to found called *The Institute for Intellectual Development of Children and Young Adults,* also known as *Kanun*. The films he produced there may have been for the benefit of children, but they were much more. All of the films Kiarostami produced at the institute were double-entendre vehicles for examining hegemony and morality. They provided ethical challenges that the audience, be they children or adults, had to resolve for themselves. They focused on how the law affects individual lives. \n\nIn Iran, Kiarostami could not speak directly about power, but by couching everything in the world of children, he managed to get past the censors. Children are allowed to question authority or protest against their parents' punishments. Children are allowed to consider the different possible courses of action they can take. Children’s problems are seen as insignificant, but Kiarostami not only saw the child’s perspective, but saw that these first encounters with power are of critical importance. Power, patriarchal power in particular, begins at home. Fathers and father figures are set up to be absolute authorities. Learning to follow the patriarch and to substitute his judgment for your own grooms you for further obedience in the future.\n\nThese themes of power and submission are so obvious in Kiarostami’s films, I can’t help but wonder what the Iranian censors were thinking. Iran is not an easy place to make films or speak truth to power. Right now as I write this, thousands of Iranians are facing down a new wave of torture, imprisonment, and murder. Iranians who grew up in the schools where these documentaries were made have summoned the courage to speak up, perhaps inspired by encounters like the ones with the principal in the film, only this time, it is in the face of a terrifying theocratic dictatorship.",

        "text": "So, I went into this thinking that Scream VI (6) was going to be that fourth level meta -- out in the real world, like New Nightmare or something. Instead, we got a lesser version of Saw: The Final Chapter.\n\nThey almost made it with the whole, 'let's stab everybody out in public' gag. Then, it just carried on with the whole, 'we're in a franchise now, so here are the new rules', where the old line was, 'we're in a trilogy, and there are certain rules to a trilogy'. This, in the context of Stab, not Scream. It's still fully contained to their own world. So, it's like meta-meta-meta at most (maybe closer to meta-meta). \n\nThey have now fully pushed the Stab franchise gag, but they pretty much got there already by Scream 4 or whatever, so this is actually nothing new and doesn't add any substance.\n\nThey didn't push the boat out nearly far enough to justify this movie.\n\nI'm disappointed. \n\nMaybe Scream 7 will really be four times meta, where the subject matter isn't Stab, the fictional Scream franchise inside the Scream franchise, but simply the Scream franchise itself inside our real world.\n\nThey surely have nowhere else to go now. What comes after 'franchise'? 'Meta franchise'? That's just stupid. They have no choice but to make Scream 7 bleed over into our real world, and that at least sounds interesting!\n\nThoughts?",

        "text": "With the 95th Oscars coming up this weekend and entertainment sites buzzing with predictions, I think this is a relevant question to ask; what is the significance of Oscars nowadays?\n\nI know people say that the Oscars don't matter because they have made so many mistakes in the past awarding less deserving films Best Picture or Best Director than films which became stone cold classics. But the very fact that people still get highly spirited about say Citizen Kane not winning Best Picture 80 years after the fact kind of means that people do care about Oscars and the validation that comes from winning it. You don't ever see people arguing about Palme D'Or winners to the extent they do about Best Picture winners despite how prestigious Cannes and how much more cinephile oriented it is. \n\nIt is also worth noting that the awards seasons usually always end with the Oscar ceremony with all other festivals/ events like Cannes, Venice etc. being seen as precursors to the Oscars rather than just being their own independent event.\n\nOf course the Oscars are also losing ratings year by year. But considering how television shows are as a whole consistently losing ratings year by year I am not sure that is a good argument in regards to Oscars not having any relevancy. Same goes for how Oscar bumo has decreased for films now in terms of box office. Isn't that because most of the nominated films are already on streaming? And of course Oscars don't award high grossing films but that is because the box office has been so dominated by franchises and stale sequel after sequel that it is pretty rare when a film is both highly commercially successful and also original enough to get nominated.\n\nSo what is the relevance of Oscars now?",

This Belgian film tells the story of two 13 year old friends who are closer than soulmates, with a bond stronger than brothers, and reveals the the trivial adolescent chatter that can break something so warm into disastrous shatters. This movie is like the sea: Beautiful, vast, with tumultuous depths beneath the surface, coming in stillness and crashing waves. The actors are incredible and the script and cinematography are flawless. If you appreciated Moonlight and Manchester by the Sea, there is a good chance you will love this film like I did. It is already one of the most impactful films I have ever seen.\n\n\\&gt;!The twist blindsided me but left me shaking. When the kids are told that they need to come to the gym after the trip, I first thought \"please don't say that Remi is dead, I will hate this movie.\" The director Lukas Dhont's last movie Girl had a twist that was an exploitative failure on similar lines. But Close does everything and more that is needs to justify the shock of Remi's death. It is a brilliant exploration of grief and guilt that only has a parallel in Casey Affleck in Manchester by the Sea. Eden Dambrine broke my heart. Some of the scenes that stick with me are Leo playing hockey, months after Remi is gone, still numb and expressionless, and disoriented in the flashing light - you can feel the weight of his terrible burden. Another scene that will remain with me is when Leo returns to visit Remi's room, with Remi's mother watching, intense and conflicting emotions all over her face, smothering Leo and forcing him to flee. Leo's brother comforting him. The fight between Leo and Remi, the shock and confusion on Remi's face every time Leo rejects him. The field of blossoms. This one will last with me for a long time.!&lt;",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/11nvvi2/interstellar_and_how_it_tackles_the_unknown/",
        "text": "I saw a post today claiming Interstellar was Nolan at his most ambitious and most out of control. It was a very interesting essay to read and contained many great points. I highly recommend you check it out. I do however have to disagree with Nolan being out of control in the film. In my opinion Interstellar is the greatest of all his work except perhaps Memento. I would argue despite its somewhat complex premise and increasingly tenuous connection to science as the film progresses through its lofty runtime, it never loses touch of its central concept due to the relationship between Cooper and Murph. Cooper is set apart from most Nolan protagonists by virtue of being more of a character than an archetype. Inception is perhaps Nolan’s most universally acclaimed film containing his own original characters, and its protagonist Dom Cobb bears a strong resemblance to Cooper where backstory and motivation are concerned. Both characters have dead wives and are trying to return home to their children. The difference that makes Cooper feel more like a character and less like an archetype is found in Interstellar’s first act set on a dying planet Earth. Throughout the beginning you get to know Cooper’s daughter Murph and witness the strong relationship between the two of them. In Inception Dom’s children are seen for a total of 10 seconds, and his wife Mal is only seen in a brief flashback and as a violent projection of his subconscious. Why does this matter? Later on in Interstellar Dr. Mann is quoted as saying “You never would have come here unless you believed you were going to save them. Evolution has yet to transcend that simple barrier. We can care deeply - selflessly - about those we know, but that empathy rarely extends beyond our line of sight.” In knowing Murph and even to a lesser extend Tom we are able to empathize with Cooper and his motivation to save his kids. Even though Cooper is attempting to save the whole human race, it’s his children, the characters we know; who provide the empathy needed to get us to care about Cooper and root for him to succeed. The lack of observable relationships in Dom’s family life by contrast makes it harder to empathize with him and his motivations. He is reduced to an archetype, a vehicle for the plot to advance. His motivations are more of an idea than something tangible and observable within the film.\n\nInterstellar is often compared to 2001 A Space Odyssey and for good reason as Interstellar can almost be described as 2001: A Space Odyssey with a more linear narrative focus and a constant protagonist. It is however overlooked how much more Interstellar resembles the Odyssey than 2001 does, despite the names of both films. Cooper is a modern Odysseus, on a voyage through space instead of sea, trying desperately to return to his family but meeting obstacle after obstacle along the way. Instead of a Cyclops and a sorceress though, the three main conflicts Cooper faces in the story are Miller’s water planet, Mann’s betrayal, and finding a way to send data out of the black hole through the tesseract. These three conflicts are noticeable for resembling the three basic conflicts in fiction. On Miller’s Planet Cooper and the crew of the Endurance find themselves amidst a harsh environment that threatens their survival and by extension their mission. This is Man vs Nature. On the second planet Dr. Mann reveals he lied about the habitable conditions of the world because he didn’t want to die and attempts to maroon the crew. This is Man vs Man (Or Man vs Mann). Finally when Cooper finds himself in the tesseract he realizes the survival of his children and the whole human race depends upon his ability to transmit the data from within the black hole to solve the equation for harnessing gravity. This is Man vs Himself. Cooper first literally faces himself attempting to convince himself to stay, but this fails and he is left with the option of giving the data to Murph. This expands the traditional sense of Man vs Himself into Man not referring to a singular protagonist but to Mankind as a species. It is left to Murph to decipher the watch and solve the equation. This emphasizes one of the key themes throughout Interstellar that mankind must work together as a species to guarantee its survival. It also serves to highlight the unofficial fourth conflict that predominates the movie: Man vs Time. Saving the human race is a race against time, a mission to find a solution before it’s too late. This is most emphasized on Miller’s Planet where the time dilation is so extreme that an hour there is 7 years on Earth, but it haunts the rest of the film through imagery such as the rotating Endurance resembling a clock with its 12 outer compartments and the tube connecting the inner chamber to the outer ring like a clock hand. And finally it is on a watch counting away to humanity’s extinction that the solution to its salvation is encoded. \n\nWhile Interstellar’s premise is perhaps the most expansive and ludicrous of any of his films, it manages to remain the most relatable and grounded because of how the conflict is created around the characters. To bring things back to Inception, while I certainly don’t think it is a bad movie, I feel its characters, while at times charismatic, never achieve a level of depth or a connection with the audience that the characters in Interstellar do. Without the character of Murph Interstellar is a vastly different movie that reads more like Matthew McConaughey sitting through an astrophysics lecture, but Murph provides a heart to the film that much of Nolan’s other work lacks. Even Brand’s often ridiculed speech about love is lended credibility through Murph’s character and the idea that love is what will ultimately cause mankind to work together to save themselves. Interstellar is not Nolan at his most out of control, but rather Nolan at his best in anchoring an out of control story in something that we as an audience can easily understand and relate to.",

Obviously, everyone has to deal with the selection bias of which movies they've seen and as such my choices are basically Western-oriented. Having said that, these are my two choices:\n\n1. **Francis Ford Coppola**: His contribution to American movies can hardly be understated for the existence of *The Godfather* alone. Having co-written and directed one of Hollywood's most transformative movies, before following it with a sequel generally considered to be of equal brilliance, a Palme d'Or winner in 1974 with *The Conversation* and then the legendarily troubled and excellent *Apocalypse Now*, Coppola could justifiably be considered the most influential figure of American cinema's most influential movement.\n2. **Charlie Kaufman**: His body of work has carried much weight in keeping both humanity and formal complexity alive in mainstream movies. Once described by Roger Ebert as the perhaps the only great writer to make screenwriting his true medium, he has written and often directed movies which feel utterly unique in their manner of humor and emotional impact. His work has intellectual depth which does not attempt to hide a deprivation of feeling but in fact complements its abundance.",

I'm paraphrasing as follows:\n\nBasically, there was an era of over-the-top films with melodramas, tons of dance/music, etc., and suddenly we're seeing so much emphasis on \"psychological\" horror/dramas, or antiheroes, \"dark\" themes, so to speak. Will we, after a few decades or so when these genres will have had their share and will have become cliches themselves, see the rise of old classical-Hollywoodesque films again? \n\nI wanted to ask whether or not this has happened in some other film industry already? Idk but on first glance, it seemed that he's correct. Audiences would always prefer something new/groundbreaking/fresh. Even recent craze regarding RRR might prove his hypothesis, if at least to a very minute degree.",

        "text": "Star Wars famously set the bar for a film’s title sequence. The title sequence feels like an appetizer for the main course. \n\nWhile watching Poker Face, I noticed the title sequence looked dated. After reading how much this wonderful series had echoes of Colombo, I watched the old Peter Falk series for the first time. Lo and behold, there was Brauer’s folio bold extended font in beautiful yellow-gold. Obviously, Poker Face was paying homage to its predecessor howdunnit series. \n\nCreating title sequences may be technically easier but finding a font to complement a film may have become more difficult. \n\n[Art of the Title](https://www.artofthetitle.com/) is an excellent resource for information regarding title sequences.",
