For example, one level might require the player to build a simple protein composed of only a few amino acids, while another level might require the player to build a more complex protein with a specific folding pattern.\n\nThe game could also incorporate different types of challenges, such as environmental challenges that simulate the conditions of the early Earth, or challenges that require the player to use a specific set of amino acids or follow a particular order of amino acid sequencing.\n\nPlayers could experiment with different strategies for building proteins, and the data generated from their gameplay could be analyzed using AI algorithms to identify patterns and new protein structures.\n\nThe game could also be designed to include a \"sandbox\" mode, where players can experiment with different amino acid combinations and see how they affect protein structure and function.\n\nOverall, a video game that simulates protein synthesis could be a valuable tool for exploring the potential of new molecules and proteins, as well as for educating and engaging players in the science of protein synthesis.",

Is it less beneficial for a human to be aware of the systems in play that keeps them alive constantly. Has any other animal evolved in a way where they know what all the systems in their body can do from the get-go. Just seems off you have like a separation from the info you pick up from the environment and your internal bodily info.
