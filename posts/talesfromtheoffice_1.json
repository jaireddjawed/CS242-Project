I don't need more pumpkin scented candles, and hand soap and candy and a wee little dish towel with a candy corn on it saying \"Boo to you!\"\n\nThe horrible person who forces this gift buying spree on her coworkers EVERY GOD DAMN YEAR doesn't understand that October through December is a really tight cash time for many people...especially those of us with kids.  1st you have fucking halloween costumes you have to buy your kids that is $$$.... then its time for  fucking christmas which is ALL OF THE MONEY....then property taxes for the house are due in January.  And hey /u/darlin133  your kids need braces!  That's gonna be $4,500.00 out of pocket for them...and by the way, you have more than one kid  who need braces AT THE SAME TIME.  The person who starts this EVERY GOD DAMN YEAR makes at least 5-6 times more in salary than I do...If they really wanted to give a gift to me to make my day, pay for one of the kids braces?\n\nI do not want to buy crap for my coworkers.  I barely can tolerate my coworkers now you expect me to buy them fun sized snickers bars and cute Halloween decorations?  Fuck that noise.\n\nThis year a few coworkers and I thought we would be smart...we saved the boo instructions from last years enforced gift giving and put them on our desk... \"we will outsmart you coworker!\" hoping that they would think someone else started this already and we already did our gifts.\n\nI have had this insipid ghost on my computer for a week...I felt good...I have beat the system..\n\nFucking came in this morning to a bag of shit scented like pumpkin with the dictate that I go pay it forward. They literally put it RIGHT NEXT TO the sign saying I had been \"Boo'd\" already.   There is no way they could not have seen the sign.\n\nI dropped my bag, looked around and dumped that gift on the desk of a random coworker.  Fuck that noise.  Here you go awful person, I fucking paid it forward with the same damn gift.\n\nIf people WANT to participate in team building giving in the office, they need to be given a choice to participate or not.  That 20 bucks you expect me to spend on random Halloween crap isn't chump change to me...it's lunches for a week for myself.  It's gas to get to this job.  It's the co-pay for my kids asthma inhaler that he needs so he, you know, can breathe (breathe in the lovely pumpkin scented candle that I didn't want!).\n\nI have no idea how to bring this up to the boss in the office that \"yeah, I really appreciate the attempt at office fun, but this really is not something I care to participate in, or can afford.\"  But there is no way that goes well...at all.\n\n",

The CEO is sure Somebody will do it; certainly, Everybody could do it, but because the CEO tells Nobody about it, naturally Nobody does it. The CEO gets angry about that, because he was sure that Somebody should have done it, and although it turns out that Everybody could have done it, because Nobody knew about it, Nobody did it. If Everybody had known about it, then Somebody would have done it.\n\nSo we end up with the CEO blaming Somebody for Nobody doing what Everybody could/would have done, if only the CEO had told Everybody - or Somebody, at least.\n\n*****\n\nIn case it's not clear: my CEO doesn't actually have any personal assistants. He just likes to throw blame when he causes problems, because he's never wrong - even when directly confronted with concrete proof that reality runs counter to his statements.  \nIt's happened enough times that I have a funny little made-up story about it.\n\nIf you watch closely, you'll see the moment when I realize that my office is actually Hell.  \nWell, not really...

        "text": "Since my overbearing boss resigned almost a year ago, there have been a lot of changes going on in the office. One such change was that it was finally acknowledged that I have some design sense (years of art school), and that I know my way around a computer well enough to remake all of our standard forms so that we have cohesive branding. Our company had a new logo designed about two to three years ago, but the old logo was still being used on a lot of documents. Adding to that, most had out of date information or fields (they've been using the same forms since the 1970s or later, with most of the PDF versions on file being scans of purple-hued ditto/spirit reproductions). \n\nWhat I was doing wasn't anything too fancy: I was making Word doc versions and using tables when I needed the boxed areas. The major thing that I was doing was standardizing typeface, both in size and style, and applying it uniformly to all documents. \n\nThis afternoon I received a call from the secretary at the main reception area. She wanted me to come down and show her how to do something in the computer. When I get there she has all these job application pages printed out all over her desk. On the screen was a new word doc where she was \"recreating\" them, and she was at a point where there was a boxed area. I showed her how to make a table in Word, but then looked at the printed pages she was referencing. It was all the old crap I redesigned. She was remaking it piece by piece in a Word doc exactly like it was before.\n\n&gt;Me: Why are you doing this, exactly?\n\n&gt;Her: I lost the file so I need to remake it.\n\n&gt;Me: I have the application form file upstairs if you lost it. Also if you've ever sent it out to anyone it's still in your Sent Mail.\n\n&gt;Her: Well, no offense but I just don't like the way the new one looks.\n\n&gt;Me: They had me redesign everything so that all the forms match, stylistically.\n\n&gt;Her: No offense, but I like this one better (points to the outdated one).\n\n\nI could feel myself getting red from anger so I quickly excused myself. \n\nIt's been part of my job since January to make all the documents look uniform/branded. She thinks she \"lost\" her old one, but in reality it was removed from the server because it's not how the company wants our forms to look anymore. This made me think of something horrible: How many old versions of shitty docs is she using/recreating because she \"doesn't like how the new ones look\"?!?",

        "text": "A few months ago we hired a new developer.  I was involved in the interviewing process and was pleased that everyone agreed to hire this individual.  He is intelligent, hard working, has good ideas, and takes instruction well. This company is quite small (i.e. because it is the summer there are currently only three people in the office including myself) and this new hire sits in the same room as me.  Our chairs face each other, however we cannot see one another as our computer monitors block our view.  \n\nOn the first day that this new hire started, I noticed that he was sniffling, snorting and clearing his throat quite a bit.  Demonstrating uncharacteristic empathy I asked him, \"Oh, do you have a cold? Will you be getting better within the next two to three days?\"  His response was that no, this is a chronic condition and that he is always sniffling, snorting and clearing his throat.  To this I replied that this is unfortunate for everyone and then attempted to do my job...\n\n... snort...\n\n... snort...\n\n... sniffle...\n\nAre you fucking serious?\n\n... snort...\n\nEvery time he sniffles, or snorts, or clears his throat it is like nails down a chalk board being smashed down on my head while Lloyd Christmas is making the most annoying sound in the world directly in my ear... also someone is playing kickball with my testicles just for fun.  This is constant, as in from the moment that I arrive in the morning till the moment I race out of the office at five o'clock.  I would say that it starts at 9, but I dread going to work so much that I find myself arriving later and later with each passing day (the president of the company tends to arrive at 10:30).  I used to be a diligent effective worker that was pleasant to everyone in the company (we have several staff members that work remotely and come in once a week for meetings), but now I want to murder/kill everyone.\n\nBecause I wanted my motive on record, I emailed the president and vice-president of the company,\n\n\"I would first like to precede this message by stating that I believe that [NAME OF NEW HIRE] is doing a great job, he is certainly an asset and this is in no way a comment on his abilities as a team member with [COMPANY NAME].  Further to this, I understand that his medical condition is not within his control and so this is likely my own cross to bear.  This notwithstanding, I feel that it is necessary for me to make it clear how I am feeling.\n\nWithout further ado, I would like to officially state how difficult I find it to be to work in the same office as [NAME OF NEW HIRE].  His constant clearing of his nose and throat is akin to finger nails on a chalkboard; each snort and sniffle sends chills down my spine and as the days progress, I am finding it harder and harder to stifle my feelings towards this.  My visceral reaction to the noises that he makes are causing me to work less effectively while in the office.\n\nI have tried to work with earbuds in my ears (something that [NAME OF OTHER EMPLOYEE], [NAME OF NEW HIRE] and [NAME OF OTHER EMPLOYEE] all seem to have no difficulty doing so), however this is not the best solution for me as I like to be present in my work, and when [NAME OF PRESIDENT OF THE COMPANY] requires my attention, I like to be able to respond to him immediately.  \n\nI will be honest, I do not know what to do in regards to this, and I do not know what I am asking of either of you.  As I mentioned, I understand that this is a medical condition and that it is not within his control.  When I was suffering from a medical condition, the two of you (and everyone else in the company as a whole) were overwhelmingly compassionate and understanding.  I am eternally grateful for this fact and I wish to extend the same courtesy to [NAME OF NEW HIRE].  I am, however, finding it difficult to do so.\n\nWhile I would appreciate an open dialog with the two of you in regards to this, I would also like to be discrete, as I do not want to make [NAME OF NEW HIRE] feel bad for a condition for which he has no control.\n\nThank you for your understanding.\n\nRespectfully,\n\n[MY NAME]\"\n\n... snort...\n\n... snort...\n\n... sniffle...\n\nA week later the president of the company pulled me into the boardroom to discuss this (the vice-president is taking the summer off).  He told me that my options are to move to another room (the only other room being a dark windowless room that is right next to the new hire's desk so that would be much much worse, or... I don't know... suck it up?  That was it.  He didn't really offer any other solutions.\n\n... snort...\n\n... snort...\n\n... sniffle...\n\nAnd so, I've been attempting to suck it up by listening to music using earbuds.  This has been exceptionally difficult for me as I love music with a passion and when it is playing I tend to concentrate on it (I've been djing for 19 years so you can imagine how deep my love for music runs), and in order to block out these noises that somehow exist in a frequency can penetrate even the bassiest music, I have to turn up the volume pretty much full blast.  I'm talking bass heavy driving techno and I can still hear this guy...\n\n... snort...\n\n... snort...\n\n... sniffle...\n\nI'm almost at my wits end.  If you read in the news tomorrow about a horrific homicide that occurred in an office located in a quaint lakeside town, don't be surprised because today the president of the company asked me to turn off my music because he can \"hear some clicking sounds.  I don't know if it is the beat or something, but could you please turn it off?\"\n\nWHAT?!?!!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!!?  Snorty McSnortingson has been snorting and sniffling for how many months and you are fucking asking me to turn off the music in my earbuds?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.... snort.\n\nTL;DR: Co-worker's snorting noises make me murder rage.\n\nEdit: Added TL;DR because I realize this was a long story that could have been summed up in one line.\n\nAddendum: \n\nJust received my proposed modified work contract which included a 4% raise.

        "text": "Small introduction:  \nThe company I work for sells houses in Spain, clients are mainly Belgians and Scandinavians. I handle post-sale for all Belgian clients,  and most UK clients.\n\nMonday, I was unable to come to the office because of personal problems. If you're unable to come, it's usually not a big deal, but that day, I was supposed to meet a client at the bank.  \nI informed my supervisor by mail that I couldn't come, and phoned in later to remind her that I was supposed to meet the clients. They would take care of it at the office (in the past, I have had to cover for other unavailable co-workers, so it's not that uncommon for this to happen).\n\nWhen I came in to work yesterday, my supervisor informed me the clients were extremely angry, and came to complain at the office.  \nTurns out, she didn't check the calendar (where every single appointment of everyone in the department is logged), and thought my appointment was with the client who came on Friday to take possession of his house.  \nTo err is human, she had explained what had happened to the client, went with them, and sorted out a few more problems they had with the house.\n\nJust 10 minutes ago, the Belgian agent/asshole sales guy, storms into the office shouting (keep in mind, we have clients sitting not 5m from where he's shouting. Way to keep up the company image, asshole).  \n*before moving on, there had been problems with this client before. They had requested some modifications for the house, and it took over three months for the builder to even give us the damn quote.*  \nHe starts ranting on about how I angered the clients, that now they won't recommend other clients because of me (in a previous conversation they had told me they would not recommend *him* as an agent, something I have heard a lot lately).  \nI calmly explained that I was unable to come in because of personal problems, that I had informed my supervisor of the appointment, and that she had already admitted being at fault.  \n\nHe turned around to another sales guy, asked for car keys, and got out.\n\nIf my boss hadn't admitted being wrong here, all the blame would have fallen on me.\n\n**TLDR;**: Cover your ass, get everything in writing, even if you just spoke over the phone.\n\n\nAddendum:  \nThis asshole annoys me to no end, I have to deal with him every single day. Every small mistake I make, if it takes over 1 day for me to answer a client (I try to answer every single email, but often it takes a week or two before I have answers from builders and furniture stores). I know this guy is making a list of every single thing I do \"wrong\" (understand that as \"not doing things the way he likes it\"), every time he emails to complain, he CCs the General Manager instead of my supervisor.  \nI know he got the previous person fired/got her so fed up she left, I wasn't given the details, but everyone agrees he had something to with it.  \nI got the job thanks to him, and I don't want to look like an ungrateful ass, but this guy is wearing my patience thin.",

        "text": "“We need a goal,” he said with a disgruntled look on his face. This was him, my official, addressing myself and my other two co-staffers in the office today. My Chief of Staff, ever the man of action and arguably the most important man in this entire puzzle, was out of the office. I think it was a meeting, but he was most likely trying to decompress from all the stress he’s been under lately. As I said before- he tries to move the world by himself, and doesn't let anyone try to help him. I personally think it’s because he doesn't want anyone to bear his burdens, but I also think it could equally be his work ethic makes him too proud of the burden itself to lighten it at all. Whatever the case may be, the only person in the office worth their weight in gold was out, and here we were, staring the man without goals in the face as he told us “we need a goal.” \n\nIn many dictionaries, a goal is defined as a sort of milestone someone would want to achieve. To have a goal itself is to imply ambition, drive, or some sort of work ethic. Antonym: laziness. \n\nThe usage of the word “goals” is also a funny thing for a person who absconds from having them in the first place. For some people with my boss’ job, they’d set goals. A great many might even set the goal to be submitting bills, or maybe getting a reform passed. Possibly you might suggest that they set the goal to be to help over 1,000 constituents in a single term or less. It would also be honorable to think that a good goal would be to try and work behind the scenes of politics itself to move the wheels just *that* much faster. \n\nMy boss’ goal?\n\nNot too sure. He wants to be an ambassador to some country. He also wants to do stuff for education. Jokes on him though- he’s already past the prime, and then some, of his life. He has literally no political power, because he never had any ambition to get any, and all he has is seniority in the state legislature, which is of itself hilarious because everyone in the know itself knows that he’s someone who votes whatever way he thinks looks politically the best. This is used to great effect by his party superiors, so I’d wager. The education thing is a joke too. If he was genuinely interested, he’d actually try. He’d get into the more closed political circles- he’d rub shoulders with the movers and shakers. Hell, he’d *become* one of those sort of people. \n\nBut we’re here to talk about goals. \n\nGoals. Funny things. Good things to have, if you do. If you don’t, sometimes you float by. Sometimes you can ride the waves of others, like a surfer over a vortex of deep blue. If you are particularly good at clutching coattails, you may appear to have satisfied faux-goals; ones that you set, or are at least saying you set while sitting in a press conference while in reality you made up those goals just now to make it seem like you achieved something.\n\nSigning onto a bill, for example, is a good way to say you achieved one of your “goals” when it comes time to grab some glory. That way, when it’s passed, and you no longer have to worry about it (as if you did in the first place), you can roll up to any constituent and say that not only did you vote in favor of it, but you *helped* to pass it. Although in reality, no work was done by you, no work really was ever thought of by you at all, and instead you may simply staple yourself onto the backs of others. You now look like you did something.\n\nNow, you’ve achieved your goal. Now, your constituents realize something- you’re a leader.\nYou can move mountains.\nYou can make things happen.\nYou can produce.\nYou can meet your goals. \nYou are a mover and a shaker.\n\nAnd now, you have their vote. \n\nGoals… If your only goal is to get re-elected, you can pretend you have a lot of goals. Boy, you can pretend to have the most important goals in the land. Then, when none of them come through, and because you already had so little (see: nothing) invested in the first place, it’s so easy to drop them that you can avoid any scandal. But any successes…. \n\nWell, it’s like fishing. \n\nYou have to find a worm first. Remember to dig where it’s moist- where it’s been raining. Somewhere the clouds have given a lot of attention. Find a big one. Find something that will attract a lot of fish. Make sure your hook is sharp- you want to be able to pierce that fish’s mouth. But not too sharp, otherwise you might cut right through it and the worm could fall off. Stick your hook into the worm. Live ones are best, as they dance with it. Fish get attracted. Bites happen; small at first, then a few, big crunches. I feel bad for the worm at this point, but that’s it’s job. Pull when you feel a tug. That hook has a job to do too, and so does the fish- but it’s just not conscious of it yet. Pull hard, now. Reel fast, then slow, then fast again to make sure you don’t stress the fish out. Work with the motions. Let it jiggle on the line- make a few waves here and there. Once you pull it out, you become god. It’s gills; now cemented together outside of the watery, self-suspending environment, are useless here. It can’t breathe, but you got the prize. Unhook it, and throw it in the cooler. Get it stuffed, and mount it. It’ll be a nice trophy over the fireplace, next to all the other ones. ",

        "text": "When I started working here, and by that I mean being paid actual money to show up instead of showing up randomly as an intern for a day or two, I started by doing emails. It wasn’t like I’d write emails to important people or change lives through my writing. What I would do, and still do, is read them. Every day. I’d log into Outlook under my official’s credentials, go through his inbox, and read the hundreds of unopened emails we get every day. All of the complaints sent in by constituents- all the requests for new legislation, asking for his support for this bill or that resolution, would be ignored by everyone. Everyone but me. It was my job to read them, file them away, and try to reply back in the voice and opinion of my state representative. \n\nThere are a lot of these. They’re sent in by computers, really, so technically they don’t count as constituent emails per se, but the websites that send them are political organizations which people sign into and give permission to use their name when sending letters asking for support or opposition of laws in the state. So although they’re almost always the same, generic, walls of text that no one cares about, they’re always recognizable as inhuman. And we get these. Every day. 90% of the emails in the inbox every day are these. \n\nSure, we get emails from constituents that are written out carefully, with time taken to make them personal and seemingly intimate. “I voted for you last cycle, and I did this year as well” some read. It’s nice to show support. Others simply say “I vote and I will remember your decision on this!”, warning the elected official, supposing he read them, of course, of the impending retribution he will face should he not abandon all previous positions in favor of this one single issue. \n\nHere's the fun part- I have to reply to these emails. The grand irony of this all is that every single email, from the Governor right down to the constituent farmer who lives in Bumshart, Nebrahoma (Credit: The Oatmeal), is addressed to my elected official. He will never see them. He hasn't opened his email in around three or more years. I think the one time he did was the day after it was given to him by the state after he won his first election. Since then he waves it off like it's a bag of toxic waste. \n\nNow when I reply to these emails, I have to not only form an opinion on behalf of my boss, but I now also have to *sound* like him. The trouble is how do you reply to an email in the voice of a condescending asshole without coming off as an asshole in the first place? \n\nThere is a light at the end of this torturous tunnel. Thankfully, all of these constituent emails and issues are filed immediately into a tidy little folder never to be seen again, titled \"Handled\". Job done. \n\nSo at the end of every day, I look at my pristine work inbox, now cleared, and realize, that many people today have contacted an elected official of the State gov't with hopes of getting their point across to the man they were told would listen to them and weigh their opinions when voting in the legislature. I regret the lie that I have to tell many people- in his name- that *I thank them* for contacting *my* office, and for giving me their opinion. \"I'll\" be sure to think of it when I'm voting next. \n\nNoticing my few hours are up in the day, I close Outlook, log off the state computer, turn it off, and head home. This process repeats every day. My chief of staff looks at the inbox the next day, pats me on the back and says \"good job in keeping it clean.\"\n\n[Link to Part I: Years in the Making](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtheoffice/comments/3062qq/years_in_the_making/)",

        "text": "I've been working for this government now for a few years. Started as an intern, and before that a campaigner on the trail of a candidate or two. That was back in highschool. I was still somewhat hopeful, and in turn interested in politics. However interesting my life was back then, I consider the more recent years to be some of the more... humorous ones, to say the least. \n\nThe life of a civil servant isn't easy. It's filled with trials and tribulations; a constituent is stuck in a life-threatening bureaucratic paper loop, or a local's Social Services paperwork didn't go through and now they might be stripped of their medication, and a local charity stopped half-way through paying some guy's bills and now he needs help before he becomes homeless. It's our job to help those kinds of people.\n\nSo I imagined, three years ago when I signed my name on a slip of creamy light-khaki colored paper that told me to swear to protect and preserve the Constitution of this state. So I have experienced, anyway, once or twice. Although we don't really get that many cases in my office specifically, we do get them once in a blue moon. The time in between those long, dreary, weeks-long stints of boredom and hypocritical \"civil service\" is spent doing other things. Reddit is popular between my coworker and I, while my Chief of Staff attempts to fix the world and doesn't let us help. He's got a great work ethic, but sometimes it isolates him. \n\nThe office itself is sort of an indicator of our productive output to society. The white-washed walls, now slightly darker due to a rooftop heater expelling black snowflakes of carbon everywhere, smearing black streaks and cracks throughout, encase a small area of roughly 30 square feet. A long, black, rubberized carpet leads from the doorway to the front divider, behind which sits my fellow Redditor. The carpet was supposed to keep the floor generally clean from the assaults of salt and gravel used by the highway department outside. Success has been varied. People rarely come in to warrant having it in the first place. Fluorescent lights indiscriminately illuminate the room, throwing harsh white light over files which haven't moved in an unknown amount of time.  \n\nA single, long, equally as bland corridor stretches the length of the office. The first door, encountered immediately as you begin the trek to the back room, is *the* office. His office. My boss' office. It's small, relatively speaking. Elected officials usually have more spacious rooms, fitted out in all the decorations and rights of splendor which would present an air of authority and governing tradition to those who enter. This all is enforced by the fact that the couch, angled to face the door, forces you by the way it's positioned to awkwardly angle your head towards a large desk, pitted against the opposite wall and arguably taking up the other half of the already claustrophobic room. That's *His* desk. So it says in the paperwork, anyway. The last time he used it was... I can't even remember. I've used it more times than he has. It's great for napping in. A single, lonely portrait of JFK lingers near the corner of it, by the wall. It has the most melancholy expression\n\nFurther down, by about three feet, is another door on the left. The conference room. It's just a conference room. Lit by the same fluorescent lights, stuffing the room with an awkward, immature lighting which reduces any meeting to an almost impolite silence with their intensity. The large, needlessly expensive granite long table is encircled by a number of executive chairs. Each is identical, with the same ass imprint engraved into the depressed seating foam as the one next to it. \n\nAt the end of the hall is a single store room. We technically don't own it. It's donated by the owner of the building. Because of this loophole, we keep all of our election material in there. Legal, but sketchy. The weird-smelling microwave, decrepit minifridge, and pile of assorted plastic silverware is also in there as well. The cleaning crew somehow managed to make that room spotless, while the rest of the office walls are stained black from the soot. \n\nAnd this is the place I work. Five days a week, and now four because of my college classes, I've been coming here for between 3 to four hours a day. I've done this now for three years, and I've grown to appreciate the finer things of government work. I've helped with presidential elections, congressional runs, county legislature campaigns, and State Legislature bids, but nothing prepared me for the irony that is the hypocritical work I don't do on a daily basis. I'll post more, but for those wondering- I'll be chronicling the hypocrisy of my State Legislature office through this account. I've had an itch to begin writing them since last year, and since I'm leaving in five months due to transferring to a four-year university from the one I'm currently in, I think now's a good time. These are the tales from my office.  \n\n",

        "text": "Where I work, there's a large call center floor and classrooms where new hires are trained are immediately adjacent, in a series of rooms behind a thin wall. \n\nAt one point, the main classroom (where groups up to 30 get training), is right next to multiple first line technicians talking to customers - and there is a *large* air duct that basically acted as a gaping hole in the wall between the people taking calls and the the people trying to learn how to take calls. \n\nNow, both this classroom and the main floor were amply ventilated by other ducts and there was a physical mechanism to close the duct on both sides. It clearly needed to be closed, because the classes were being disturbed by noise from the floor, and the floor was being disturbed by noise from the classes. So, employees were asking management to close it on a regular basis but always got the same answer. Middle management was waiting on confirmations on whether *they were allowed to close it.*\n\nIt dragged on for months and months. The problem? The director could not find people able or willing to say authoritatively that 1. Closing the duct (with a pre-existing mechanism) was allowed by building code or other city legislation, 2. That it would cause no insurance or liability issues, even in the event of a fire and 3. that the building lease allowed them to touch it. So what did they do in the meantime? They asked people on both side of the wall to speak quietly to avoid bothering the others, even the guys who were taking calls. Just on the other side of the vent, the teacher from his desk had to 'quietly' give classes too.\n\nWe were all incredulous at the time, but it's such a classic example of our management's acute routine paralysis that people just dealt with it. Sometimes someone would go complain to the union steward, though, given how ridiculous it was. \n\nEventually the union steward got tired of hearing about it, got up on his own and shut the damn thing on both sides. Everybody expected a manager to immediately say it needs to be opened again until they make a final decision. But no. The director told lower management to leave it alone. Soon we learned why; now that the union had shut it down without authorization, they felt their asses were covered if it caused legal, contractual or safety problems later - *as they could now blame the union if it turned out to be a problem.* \n\nThe air duct has been tightly shut down to this day.

I mean - it was on our post and it was a problem for the corp, someone screwed up over there too - but usual protocol is to call the contact number and give them a reasonable window of time to correct the problem themselves.\" \n\nWhen you get a direct order from management you can voice an objection. If management gives the go anyway, then you're supposed to carry out the directive and THEN file a grievance - which is taken extra-seriously if you voiced an objection beforehand. The exception in the work contract is if the order is any health &amp; safety risk. Then you're supposed to refuse the direct order and immediately go ahead with the grievance until the bilateral H&amp;S board gives an all-clear. That wasn't the case here. If the order is blatantly illegal you can also just call police, but road techs aren't expected to be lawyers on the side.\n\n&gt; Bytewave: \"... wow. That's crazy, they know they could be sued something fierce! We can't do that. The road tech did exactly what he was supposed to, though. The grievance he filed can be horse-traded for almost anything we want.\"  \n\n&gt; Union Veep: \"It's already been, soon as HR learned about it.

The list is short but he's not the first.\" \n \n...\n\nSeveral managers and a couple union employees are paid by the corporation right now to do absolutely nothing. In theory they can end that at any time. But they keep those people on payroll either to protect a manager they \"had to fire\" or a union employee they know they fired for a reason so bad it would get them in hot water if it ever got in front of an arbitrator.",

        "text": "I'm putting part 1 because, though this is the most recent incident, it is neither the first nor last. \n\nObligatory background information: I work in a boutique law firm in Florida. We do a lot of stuff with real estate, specifically collection of debts and foreclosures. \n\nOur receptionist is bad. By bad I mean bad apple bad, felony bad, looks-like-a-toad bad, rude-to-million-dollar-clients bad, rude-to-everyone bad. The only reason she hasn't been fired yet (we *think*) is because none of the clients have complained to our head partner and office manager (she's a whole series of stories by herself), and because we don't do background checks at Perfect Little World law firm (hence having two felony convictions for theft and falsifying information to a pawn dealer). But I digress, we are not all perfect here at Perfect Little World law firm.\n\nOh, but she is.\n\nNow, because I'm a really lowly ranked member of the firm, and when our receptionist's back up is out, (and because our office refuses to accept that some calls will and *can* be missed) I am tasked with covering the receptionist for lunch, for when she needs her ten minute breaks to pee and groom herself in the mirror every hour, and when we need to retrieve and send out our office's mail.\n\nShe had already pissed me off earlier in the day by taking nearly an hour for her little quick lunch in our kitchen not ten feet away from the reception desk, then spending another few minutes in the hall in plain sight having a conversation while I sit being tortured by ringing phones she should be answering, pawning off work onto me, and requesting I take things back that she didn't want on her desk. Whatever, lady.\n\nI had planned to leave at about 4, but with her back-up gone, I was going to need to stay until 4:30 to take the mail down to the mailboxes, and then I would leave. So come exactly 4:31, I am clocked out, standing in the reception area, about to tell her that the reason my arms are full of mail is because I'm taking it down and leaving (because she would actually question me \"Are you taking the mail down?\" looking just like that), and she isn't there. I wait a little while longer, hoping I hear her coming down the hall with her lumbering steps on her 6 inch wedges. Nothing. No sign of her at all. I'm only slightly pissed off at this moment, so I take her little note pad that she uses to write down people's information, and I write in big, capital letters \"I TOOK MAIL - DANIcandii\" and I circled it and left it on her desk in full view of anyone who walked by. I thought, no one could be blind enough to miss this blatant message here.\n\nOf course, I'm always terribly wrong when it comes to this woman.\n\nI'm in the car driving home, and I receive a [text](http://i.imgur.com/psB3z7I.png?1) from this lovely European woman I work with, telling me that our receptionist has gone around the entire office, bothering people with phone calls, looking for me to see if I had taken the mail down and/or left.\n\nNow, logic would dictate that, it's well after 4:30 (our set mail time), DANIcandii is usually on time, DANIcandii is not here, the mail bin is empty. DANIcandii = took mail and left.\n\nBut this is assuming that our receptionist has an ounce of logic about her, which is a dangerous assumption.\n\nNo, her logic was to play phone tag with everyone in the office first, then check the mail bin, with no concept of time, tact, or professionalism. Then she sends me an email, which I received this morning:\n\n&gt;Next time you are leaving at 4:30 and [back-up] is not here, please check with me before you leave and take the mail down. There was more mail to be taken down and you were gone without checking with me.  \n\nThanks!\n[Dumbass]\n\nYes, a perfectly logical response, and I would have done so, had she been anywhere near where she was supposed to be in the first place. I waited and wasted my time on her not showing up to explain, left her a note which did what it needed to *HAD SHE READ IT*. I don't need to \"check\" with her. She isn't my mommy and she certainly isn't my boss. She's the *receptionist*.\n\nAnd the \"more mail to be taken down\" was one letter from a paralegal who had legs and all the capabilities one needs to take the elevator down to the mail boxes and back up again. And that was after our 4:30 mail deadline that *everyone* in the office is aware of. Oh, but that one letter, that could destroy our whole company for going out a full five minutes later than everything else. Yes, I see your logic, madam (this is sarcasm, something which she also does not understand).\n\nTL; DR: our receptionist is a petty butt hole.\n\nEdit: words",

        "text": "For years, there were rumors upper management believed there was a well-placed corporate spy working against us. Our top competitor always seemed to know about our major offers, promotions, ads and new services well ahead of time­ - well before most employees knew about them - and always came up with timely counters. They had information that suggested their informant had to be at least mid-management, mainly because of secretive timetables, that they believed were getting leaked. Because nobody can keep a secret in this place, soon everybody knew we had a 'spy problem'.\n\nBut for years this went on as an open secret, and clearly they weren't finding their guy. Corporate Inquisition is known to be aggressive but incompetent. Fast forward a bit, this becomes old news,  basically just another ghost story told occasionally 'round the watercooler to newbies. \n\nI'm then offered to participate in a special project; we're launching a new product soon, and a temporary team is being set up to coordinate and prepare procedures and policies regarding tech support, sales, inter-department communication, SLAs, document known issues from the readiness tests, etc. Three months without taking calls? Why not. I'm surprised several colleagues with more seniority than me passed on this, but I'm game.\n\nThe team is basically three guys from tech support's senior staff with four girls from CSR Sales' senior staff and an engineer who worked on the actual product, plus off-site contacts in a few other departments. We're set up in a nice office on CSR sales' floor and given pretty much carte blanche, including overtime, as long as we meet our timetables. That's the great thing with product launches, management want it to go well so badly they do silly things like getting 8 union people in a room without any real management (just periodic check-ins and progress reports) and let them sign off on their own overtime and order dinner on their dime if staying late. Obviously, 'due to the heavy workload', we soon fell into a pattern of staying way past anyone else on that floor, pretty much the only time in my life I can say I was working 60 hours weeks. Good times; we had lots of fun especially once we were alone on the floor, although we were also doing the work quite nicely, putting in our 100%, at least 50% of the time. After 12 weeks of this, we were all great friends. During this time, one of the things we heard often from Sales' girls was how they hated their floor director - their union reps were virtually at war against her because she seriously overstepped in various ways and was generally rude and very controlling. But getting rid of a bad director is way harder than getting rid of a bad manager, and she had been glued there for years. Heard plenty of horror stories about her.\n\nProject nearing it's conclusion, and we're finalizing everything; and one of the things to do is prepare some hard copies of our final reports to hand over to three directors. It was well past office hours. ^We ^might ^have ^had ^a ^little ^wine ^with ^dinner.\n\n&gt; Caroline: \"We should print this on glossy paper, it'd be nice.\"\n\n&gt; Tania: \"We're supposed to be pretty much paperless, where do you figure we'll find 150 pages of glossy?\" \n\n&gt; Bytewave: \"I don't work here, but on every floor I've been, each director's secretary has a stash of the good stuff. Usually unlocked. I've helped myself before.\"  \n\n&gt; Caroline: \"Yep, I've seen her with some before. We should snoop. Even if its locked they leave the keys laying around.\"  \n\nSoon, four of us are poking our noses where they don't belong on an empty floor. The director's office and the secretary's were adjacent, separated by an half-wall and sharing a single door, conveniently unlocked. The most promising file cabinet however was locked. The girls start checking the secretary's drawers for keys, not finding any. I check the much-loathed director's desk.... Score! Keys, and... what is this...?\n\nA thick stack of Engineering and Systems' paperwork on the upcoming product launch we're working on. Okay, not sure what a CSR Sales Director need this for and... why did she bother to underline so much stuff... After I threw the girls the keys so they can loot the glossy paper stash, I'm suddenly paying close attention to this. It's marked secret and neither stack seems to be intended for anyone outside the respective departments' top management. It has specific dates, targets, costs and budgets underlined, addresses where what equipment will be deployed, then there's a full copy of a partnership agreement with another company. And it was laying there in an unlocked drawer protected by nothing but the full might of a stapler, a set of office keys and some gum. \n\nNot sure yet if it's evidence of anything, after all the company isn't known for it's stellar internal security, its *possible* they let paperwork flow around at this level. Still, I put the stack next to her nameplate and I start taking photos, page by page.  \n\n&gt; Caroline: \"What's that?\"\n\n&gt; Bytewave: \"Maybe nothing. Maybe something your union reps will be really glad to see. Could you go fetch Christopher for me? I want another set of eyes on this.\"   \n\nThat would be the Engineer who was working on our merry little special project. He also did a stint as Union rep years before. He arrives a couple minutes later, I'm still taking photos of Systems' paperwork.\n\n&gt; Christopher : \"Sup, paper thieves? Any top-shelf bottle tucked in there?\"  \n\n&gt; Bytewave: \"Take a look at this stack of paperwork, it's from Engineering. Tell me if that's something your boss would let CSR Sales get it's hands on?\"  \n\nHe takes a look with an indifferent shrug at first. \n\n&gt; Christopher : \"... Holy hell. That's... I mean I know for sure *I'm* not allowed to see this. The headend with this redundancy... it's supposed to be off-books, only our insurer and the people maintaining it were supposed to know where it was for security reasons, and only a dozen more that we would have one at all. Uhh... no, this shouldn't be here, especially not with all the juicy bits underlined.\"    \n\n&gt; Bytewave: \"I thought so as well. I'll put these photos on an SD card and tomorrow... Wait, who are you calling, it's nearly 10?\"    \n\n&gt; Christopher: \"Union VP. They're 24/7, and we spent three months hearing how horrible this director is, if there's any chance she's the fabled corporate spy...\"    \n\nNo more argument from me. Chris explains the find. He says we were looking for a stapler, which is actually a believable story, they're also pretty rare since we 'went green', though the printers can staple just fine. He's not asking questions about the how, anyway, and he seems *very* interested. Then we just take our ill-gotten glossy paper and put everything back the way it was. The next day, the union VP picks up the SD card personally outside and says nobody in the union will say how it was obtained. \n\nWhen any manager is fired, there's always still a token intranet note with a polite line wishing them luck in their future projects or some other platitude like everybody's happy. This is the only time it was ever 'forgotten'. A week or two later, there's instead a glowing 'nomination' describing the long pedigree of the new young and dynamic interim Director for CSR Sales, exactly like if the position had been long vacant or freshly created. Not a word about the fate the previous holder. Her name doesn't appear anymore in in-house mail - usually it takes 6 months for them to clear the inbox' of departed employees. Profile also gone from the 'Our Management Team' bios page. Her personal 'executive account' in the billing system is gone; not downgraded to regular; she's not subscribed to our products anymore, and instead of a 'deactivated' profile, it's just *deleted*, like there had never been a customer at her address. Soon after, there were rumors Legal were suing her, with few details.\n\nSales' union personnel were very happy, and I hear that even low-level managers were suddenly openly glad to see her gone. Only one problem - this changed very little for the company's security. To this day, our main competitor still seems to have all the inside scoops, clearly they had more sources or contingencies. On the flip side, we now have reasons to believe we've infiltrated them too. We sometimes hear details about their plans or projects ahead of when we would hear about our own.\n\nSo, there seems to be growing demand in the healthy field of corporate espionage. If you want to try this exciting career full of social engineering intrigue... secure your damn paper-trail if it must exist at all.",

        "text": "Last week, I went to my boss (whose last name is Dotson), to ask for a small raise. Basically, what I was asking was for my yearly 4% raise, just early, about 6 months before annual reviews. My company never gives raises, but my wife and I needed to make a little extra to make ends meet, so I thought it wouldn't hurt to ask.\nIn the meeting, my boss was very gracious, but basically said, \"I'm sorry, but we might not be even be able to give raises at all this year.\" To which, I basically said \"thanks anyway.\"\n\nOn the way out, in a stroke of sheer brilliance, I stuck my head back in his office and said \"Just don't get cheap on me, Dotson. That was Hammond's mistake.\"\n\nI have never seen him laugh that hard. He then told me he'd see what he could do about a raise.\n\nApparently the CFO (who my boss reports to) is a huge Jurassic Park fan. Like, he has signed scripts, autographed posters, etc. I had no idea. But he thought that was great and was slightly upset he hadn't made some sort of Dodgson reference earlier. (In the past week, I've overheard him say \"Dotson! We have Dotson over here!\" 3 times)\n\nAnyways, I was given a 6% raise, and I have lunch with the CFO next week!\n",

        "text": "Now I work in what is affectionately called the Military-Industrial Complex.  I can't say who I work for or in what role, whether private or government.  But there is something just delightful about how the whole process works out.\n\nFor one, government bureaucrats HATE going through the standard acquisitions process.  Say they want to buy something cool and deadly that needs to be built that will cost around a measly $1 billion.  The standard and by-the-book way to do this would be to put together an RFP, a Request-for-Proposals, wait several months, and let the bids roll in.\n\nThe government department is obligated to review all the proposals, take them all seriously (even the ones that are crap), and then they have to find a reason to select the vendor they wanted in the first place.  They then wait for the lawsuits to roll in from all the other butt-hurt multi-national corporations who felt they were unfairly treated.\n\nThis process can extend for several years before the contract gets started, by which time the Colonel or Senior government employee who got the ball rolling on this has already been promoted and is no longer in charge.  In its place is a new witless government replacement who bites off more than they can chew and has to take the vendor's word for it when they say something can't be done without a plus-up in money.\n\nTo avoid all of this needless headache, it is easier to amend an existing contract.  Literally, there are contracts between all the major defense vendors that are 50+ years old that are continuing to be amended and added on to to this day.\n\nNeed something new and deadly that will cost $100 million?  Can we plausibly frame it as part of an existing contract?  Let's make it an addendum to the X Contract that has been running since the Nixon administration!\n\nTo be fair though, I wouldn't necessarily consider this unethical.  I'd consider it more entrepreneurial.  Just bureaucrats finding ways to make their departments run effectively under rules and regulatory regimes they have no control over.\n",

        "text": "Per request, this is a follow up on [yesterday's Tale](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtheoffice/comments/2c4799/my_first_job_75_employees_55_printers_xpost/) where I described the weird experience that was my first job out of college, as internal support at a corporate headquarters where luxury, terrible IT practices and cloak and dagger intrigue and turf wars were tightly intertwined. I recommend reading that part first to get an idea of what kind of HQ we're talking about. I'm obviously not much of a hero in this story, as it takes place in a room where it's not my place to speak. Company name is fictional.\n\nThat day everyone put on their best suits, it was the big quarterly Executive Board meeting. I had set up the projector and set up the powerpoint I'd been told they needed to see the day prior, so that all they'd need to do was push a button to peruse it. There was a flurry of activity the main boardroom, where such events took place. Staff were arranging stacks of glossy paper, moving in fresh flowers, baskets of fresh fruits that nobody would touch. Water and crystal glasses at hand, silverware and some buckets of fine champagne a few feet away in case they decided there was something to celebrate. The room is swept for bugs by security. Imagine a large projector on one of the off-screen walls, [and picture a room like this.](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/5859263/special/boardroom.jpg)\n\nFor me it should be just another day. \n\nMeeting begins, all the top brass is there plus a few special guests sitting on the board, including a key ex-political leader who is sitting on this board for reasons I can't fathom. About three quarters of an hour in, my phone rings, and it's the emergency line. Why have an emergency line at all? Like everything else in this office, it's prestigious to have something others don't, even if it's just another number to call IT.\n\n&gt; /u/bytewave: \"Newsprint HQ IT, Bytewave speaking.\"\n\n&gt; President's Secretary: \"Good morning. IT is required with due haste in the Windsor boardroom.\"  \n\nUh oh, projector issues. I hurry to the gates where I'm waved through. Nobody acknowledges my presence except the IT Veep who eyebrows at the projector to explain my task. The sole empty chair is near it, and I quickly get to the only thing I'm really doing in this story, resetting a projector. \n\n&gt; HR Veep: \"The wave of acquisitions has overall been a remarkable success, and as Finance Veep explained earlier, we are on much stronger footing both laterally and vertically than three quarters ago, but we need to address integration issues. Some employees aren't adapting to our business culture and cling to previous identities, we have regional offices where even after sending clear directives, they don't even answer the phones saying 'Newsprint'.\"\n\nThe President of the company is getting pretty old. His son and heir has been piling up titles for awhile. Things like 'Vice-President without portfolio' and 'Executive Coordinator for the greater Canada region' ... (I was unaware there was such a thing as a Greater Canada region, until I learned this referred to including certain operations they had in Michigan, so just so you know, Michigan is now officially a disputed border area). Anyhow, we'll call him The Dauphin. He's in his mid to late 30s. It's pretty clear daddy is letting him run this meeting as he sits back comfortably at the other end of the table.\n\n&gt; The Dauphin: \"Well that's going to end now. *We brought these people, they're ours now*. What's written on their pay checks? Newsprint. So they're going to extend their hand, smile and say they work for Newsprint whenever anyone asks, or we'll replace them. For key staff, sit them down with HR and make sure they get the message.\"\n\nSeveral people immediately proceed to knuckle the table repeatedly in strangely enthusiastic support. The projector is back up, the IT Veep gives me more eyebrowed instructions for 'stay and operate it'. I don't get another glance at for the rest of the meeting, I might as well have resold my suit as an invisibility cloak on Ebay.\n\n&gt; HR Veep: \"Yes, that's the best game plan. There are also morale issues regarding the standardization of pay-scales, contract lengths and miscellaneous benefits. Some staff have wrongly been led to believe by their previous employers that we were guaranteeing previous employment conditions, which we have for the duration of certain contracts, but it wasn't desirable to do so for permanent employees. In our past core holdings, there are also morale fears related to the possibility of further reductions of force even though they are generally unwarranted.\"\n\n&gt; Legal Veep: \"We made it clear to our partners throughout the acquisition process that streamlining costs and eliminating redundancies across the piece was a core operational goal here. If previous management misinformed their workers intentionally I'll need hard evidence, that could be actionable. We never did sweetheart deals and we can hardly start now if we want to keep the momentum this brought us.\"\n\n&gt; The Dauphin: \"So, same deal. *Rotate scrubs where necessary* where this is impacting productivity and sit down key players until this smooths over. People are always afraid of change, but they also always get used to it - otherwise they'll eventually have to move on. If any issues like this poses operational risks on any floor, bring it up to me and we'll figure out who we parachute in to micro and babysit.\"\n\nMy head is spinning. I've been sitting there for 5 minutes only, and there's two hours left of this. They are creatively outbidding each other in business jargon but they all fundamentally agree. Cut conditions as planned, if anyone is trouble 'sacrifice' them. People worried about the security of their livelihoods? Why don't we 'surplus' a few more. \n\nMercifully they eventually start wanting to look at pie charts about how much money this creative strategy is making them, so they turn towards the projector and I can distract myself with guessing when to press next on a powerpoint presentation. There are no instructions forthcoming since we've established my invisibility and all. \n\nIn addition to their disregard for 'acquired' employees and former employees alike, as they discuss 'growth strategies' they go on to show disdain for customers and business partners alike. The ex-political leader in the room listens and occasionally nods, not contributing anything substantial or showing even the vaguest hint of concern at any of it. To think that had I been old enough at the time, I wanted to vote for this guy.\n\nWhile I can't type nor remember every word spoken in that meeting, these parts stuck to me the most and helped shape my view of corporations and the role they should play in our societies. Eventually they run out of slides and varia and, ignoring the carefully arranged food all over the table, the President hits the intercom to his secretary. \n\n&gt; President: \"We're about to wrap it up, we're going to need real food in here.\"\n\nAnd then staff came in to take away the glossy paper, open the champagne and whoever was on retainer to handle food gets busy. I get a small nod from the IT VP and eyebrows for 'You may go now'. And that was the only time I got to sit on a corporate board meeting. The Dauphin has now been for about a decade the CEO of Newsprint, an old behemoth in decline that is still hard at work missing the digital revolution.\n\n- TL:DR: Sent in to fix projector. Listen to the twelve most overpaid people I've ever seen together in a room creatively outbid each other with miscellaneous business slang for \"Beatings will continue until morale improves.\" ",

I got 1 hour each consecutive month I worked, and by Month X I was a full-time employee.\n\nMonth 1: working 4 hours a day. I got my wage 10 days late.\nMonth 2: working 5 hours a day. I got my wage 7 days late.\nMonth 3: working 6 hours a day. Surprisingly, the money was mine on time.\nMonth 4: working 7 hours a day, the money's 3 days late.\nMonth 5: working 8 hours a day, after 10 days the money hasn't come in at all.\n\nSo I go to accounting, ask what's wrong, they explain to me how it HAS to be right cos their system does it. They tell me to come back later.\n\nI do, and tell them again how I never got the money. They show me a transfer had been made (that same day, in the 20 minutes I was gone). But it's for a sum I earned when working 6h/day.\n\nI show them my contract, they apologise, but explain that 8 hours times what I earn is 6 hours times what I earn. I respectfully disagree, as does the calculator.\n\nSo they make an extra transfer, and two weeks after my paycheck send me the extra money.\n\nI ask them to make sure to change the system data before the next month, cos the SO and I had to actually borrow money from people to buy food, and I was on the verge of carrying a loaf of toast bread and a few packs of cheese home from the office kitchen for breakfasts.\n\nBut finally, the cash comes (14 days late, with the follow-up amount a further 2 days delayed), and they promise next month will be better.\n\nFor the next 2 months, I get paid the 6-hour wage on time, and correction amounts within the following week. Apparently, changing one digit in the system is just too difficult.\n\n**TL;DR: Math and calendars are hard, especially when one works in accounting.**",

        "text": "This is an old story, not from my current workplace where frontline could have to argue to get a free pad of paper and pen, but from my former job where I started out as part of a 3 man team in-house IT at the HQ of a newspaper company, back when that line of work still got the bills paid. Fresh out of college, I would have been the classic PFY if I hadn't Accutane'd the hell out of the pimples years before. Technically I started as an intern, but it was a well paid internship followed by a series of generous short contracts.\n\nI knew they were into printing, but that did not prepare me for the printer to worker ratio that stunned me as I walked in there. There was a formal 'print room' with a couple of the most expensive super office printers I'd ever heard of at the time. These two had all the features necessary to print legal tender and were not commercially available. There were the regular kind of printer pretty much everywhere there was a corner to put one around the floor, and yet every secretary had their own in their offices, too, and half the staff were secretaries. This wasn't a place with cubicles. All offices and boardrooms. Even the maintenance closet doubled as a relatively nice office.\n\nIt didn't stop with the printers. Everyone had everything. The latest gadgets for everyone above janitor. Second day my boss gives me an Expenses account explaining that I'll have to regularly purchase new things as I get orders handed down. \n\n&gt; /u/bytewave: \"Okay, I need to understand better how things work here. Why so many printers? Why are we ordering so many laptops and licenses just for this floor?\"\n\n&gt; My First Boss: \"Like we talked about in the interview, this is HQ and it has a unique culture. Anything that gets paper approved by any of the 12 Veeps or the President's secretary does not get disputed, we order it, we set it up nicely, we sync it when they can't. Each of them will be making sure their secretari(es) have all the same toys as the others. You'll be mostly migrating boxes for now, but if you get a paper order or email for any equipment, you put it in right away. By the way, always knock before entering a room with a closed door and wait to enter.\"  \n\nOh yeah, migrating boxes... that's why they needed me to help out initially. Who the hell migrates all corporate boxes to a new version of Windows before SP1 is out? These guys. I've cloned more installs of Windows 2000 than I care to remember. They averaged 3 computers per head given the mountain of laptops. \n\n&gt; /u/bytewave: \"Instructions received, but I'm still fuzzy on the why on earth would they need all this?\"  \n\n&gt; My First Boss: \"It's not about need. There are some turf wars you won't want to get involved in. You'll see justifications like 'confidential work, cannot be printed on general printers', sometimes none. They don't matter, just remember, immediately order anything if it's from a Veep or the President's secretary as long as you get a paper trail and log everything. Aside from that, anytime anyone here calls you, stop cloning and go sync their PDA, unjam their printer or whatever. Keep the pager on you, keep the server room locked tight, be on time, dress like this, and carefully ignore whatever isn't tech related going on around here and you'll do great. Any questions, come to me or call.\"\n\nI soon understood what he meant. I have no point of comparison, this being the only time I worked in a corporate headquarters, but it was all turf wars and appearances, which were greatly valued over effectiveness. They'd routinely order equipment they'd never use just because one VP had authorized it for her secretary and now they all wanted one and they all got one. That was what had caused the explosion in printers; having your 'private' printer locked in your office was a status symbol of sorts. There was a lady whose' job was to ensure the huge 'office supplies' room was stocked up with everything imaginable and the cafeteria always full of everything, anyone could take anything they wanted, nobody cared if you took supplies home, she'd restock. No time for breakfast before work? Fresh muffins, fruits and such all the time. There were open fridges and damn good coffee. There were a few other perks, I'll save the best for another story.\n\nThe dress code and the level of chic was out of this world. They had a professional designer who came in biweekly to make sure everything was up to snuff, and she had a thing for pricey art and random furniture upgrades. Almost everyone had an official title so inflated that made it difficult to quickly understand the formal and informal hierarchies. The secretaries almost all looked like models, and there was a reason I was told to always knock before entering rooms. Rooms had names. 'Guttenberg Room', 'MacKenzie Suite', stuff like that. The President had a condo that he never used that was built as an extension of the floor, 1400 square feet of top-value skyrise office space lost, in case he ever felt like spending the night. Access was tightly regulated, I only went in once in over two years, but I could tell millions were spent on it. There was champagne and truffles on the clock every time they brought something out, which was all the time, they had come into money for a series of acquisitions. Meanwhile I kept hearing that in factories and floors they owned everywhere the conditions were terrible and staff retention was a big issue. But from the 39th floor in that tower, everyone was a kid in an open-bar candy store. \n\nI came to understand I got the job largely because I looked sharper, sounded more educated and dressed better than the others for the interview. They assumed we could all do the technical work given the degrees, which was a dangerous assumption given I learned on the job half the things I had to do. At least, I did learn a ton there. I had a very colorful coworker who was admittedly a good teacher in retrospect. Having to support such a mishmash of constantly rolling luxury hardware with no standardization process whatsoever was.. interesting. And the only thing I could really say 'no' to was 'please open the server room's door'. \"I want admin on this laptop\"? ... \"Yes, ma'am\". And then I'd be removing comet cursor the following week.\n\nWe all have to start somewhere. I could definitely have done a lot worse, at least I had a taste of corporate luxury.",

        "text": "Once of my occasional jobs as senior staff in my telco is to correct technical exams for some positions internally. Since we're union, positions are allocated by seniority, IF you can pass the relevant tests to prove your ability. Because management likes to make sure seniority doesn't play *too* much a role, they make the exams -quite- hard and always broader than what you need to do the job, but that's part of the game, we just correct them. And to some extent, we don't mind hard exams either, as long as they are fair. Nothing worse than incompetent people in senior union positions.\n\nOne day, there's a nice one open I'm correcting for. Three top applicants seniority-wise clearly flunked it, and a suit comes to tell me it'd be 'great' if the fourth did too. I know the fourth guy is a stronger candidate, but I haven't seen his exam yet. But I already get it. The fifth in line is clearly management's favorite, still a frontline agent, but she's always skirting the rules in their favor and is almost never actually taking calls, always given 'special tasks' that almost never go to frontline employees. Maybe her looks are helping. In short, they want her to have the job I'm correcting for.\n\nNow, I'm not in the game of cheating on exam notes. But then again, I know there's actually two exams and I'm only correcting one. The job also comes with a psychometric eval tested out of house, and there's clear signs management uses these to occasionally get people they don't want get flunked. \n\nSo I carefully look at number 4's test, and see he should pass it by a decent margin; didn't ace it, but he passed and pretty good given how hard it is. But I know the rules, and I only see one way to play this under the circumstances.\n\nI narrowly flunk him instead.\n\nBut I make several obvious mistakes in my notations on purpose; clear grounds for a re-correction by a panel of three, as per the work contract. However, the low-level manager in charge just sees he failed, he's happy, and he doesn't bother tempering with his 'independently tested' psychometric - if they did it too often, we'd prove it, so they much prefer technical failures. He therefore passes psych with flying colors, but is told he won't have the job because he failed the technical exam. Union steward steps in, asks as he is entitled to to see the exam, and then points out the mistakes I've told him I made while correcting. Soon a panel of three union senior staff are 'reviewing my work' and giving him the generous passing marks he deserved. He therefore gets the job, whether they're happy with it or not.\n\nFor awhile after that I oddly enough never got assigned to correct exams - not that I cared much. The guy I stood up for learned the story from the steward and we became fast friends. The pretty management's pet who was just below him went to accept a non-union position instead, which I believe fit her way better anyway.\n\nWhile it may seem like taking a big bullet to do this, the fun part with a union environment is that there is zero retaliation if you play your hand properly, and while low-level management soon forgets (how could they not, given their turnover rate), the union doesn't ever. And they take their friends out to lunch a lot.",

        "text": "This is a bit more 'office politics' than tech, but it's worth sharing.\n\nYears ago, I'm mind-numbingly sorting tickets escalated to various engineering departments that haven't been addressed in months. It's one of my tasks as senior staff that I like to spend some time on when I don't feel like talking to anyone. They're so busy with 'emergencies' and understaffed that they almost never get to the tickets until they get an email reminder that they've been sitting there for months. Everyone should know if you want something done the same year you call them, you don't send a remedy ticket.\n\nOut of the blue the department director stops by, makes small talk for a few minutes and invites me to lunch. I'm surprised. I get business lunches with managers, but not with directors, at least not since we had one I was good friends with. This one I just have a professional relationship with. And when I temporarily filled in as union steward a few years before, and he was still a manager, we had a few 'lively arguments'; water under the bridge as far as I'm concerned, but still. He's not one to show emotion either, who knows if that is mutual?\n\nBut anyhow, fully expensed lunch with martinis at a steakhouse while I'm paid on the clock? Even if he was my sworn nemesis I don't turn that down.\n\nWe discuss the department and operations a bit, he says my work is getting lots of praise from my manager, and then the purpose becomes clear:\n\n&gt; Director: \"You know, you were very effective when you filled in as steward, you showed me you know the game, and you are very versatile. You can keep a cool head and put your foot down when you need to. Ever been interested in management?\"\n\nFor a second I'm surprised, I just came back from an extended sick leave months before, I'm well known to be close to the union (*they* usually are the ones to take me out to lunch), and I'm very good at my job but I have no experience in management whatsoever. But union employees are allowed to fill in on an 'interim basis' with a nice 20% bonus for several months, and it could get me in some meetings I'd be interested to sit in and behind some interesting closed doors. At that point they must resign to become full managers. I have no intention of resigning from my union position, but if I can play it right...\n\n&gt; /u/bytewave: \"Yeah, given the right conditions I could very well be, it could be a fun new challenge. We'd need to negotiate a few details. My current seniority would have to be carried over. I'd want my compensation package bump to take into account the considerable money I'm currently making from overtime, and be guaranteed as much time off as I have right now, and the usual.\"\n\nI get slightly sweaty palms, thinking I'm probably going in a little hard because of the martinis. Its still just the interim time I'm after. Wear a suit for 6 months, then turn a contract down and go back to my job? Could be fun and very informative.\n\n&gt; Director: \"Full seniority might be an issue, you'd be bumping most managers in terms of schedule, but we could work something out. The rest would be perfectly doable.\"\n\n&gt; /u/bytewave: \"I could concede partial seniority and definitely be willing to work some graveyard shifts while I'm on my interim basis.\" After all, that's usually how it goes when they promote from the union.\n\n&gt; Director: \"Interim basis? No, we're talking about terms for a contractual basis. Usually we start with 6 months but given your background and seniority I'm perfectly comfortable to double that.\"\n\nA one year contract? That means I'd have to resign from the union and he can throw my ass out in a year if he wants. The math adds up in a flash. He didn't like me as a union rep, he knows I'm still unofficially feeding the union all sorts of stuff, I've been gone nearly a year and since my paperwork was good I got full pay, I don't actually know how much he still dislikes me. The amount of money he readily suggested he was fine with is much higher than what a low-level suit gets. Either he's trying to buy me out to cut me off from the union and get some intel on his own, or it's a long con to \"not renew\" me in a year on some bullshit performance excuse. \n\n&gt; /u/bytewave : \"I see. There is plenty of precedent for letting union members have an interim basis before they resign, though. Given it's a new challenge, I want to be certain I'm fully tooled for this exciting opportunity before we sign a contract. Doesn't need for be 6 months, but I'd say, at least 3 or 4?

        "text": "This is a bit more 'office politics' than tech, but it's worth sharing.\n\nYears ago, I'm mind-numbingly sorting tickets escalated to various engineering departments that haven't been addressed in months. It's one of my tasks as senior staff that I like to spend some time on when I don't feel like talking to anyone. They're so busy with 'emergencies' and understaffed that they almost never get to the tickets until they get an email reminder that they've been sitting there for months. Everyone should know if you want something done the same year you call them, you don't send a remedy ticket.\n\nOut of the blue the department director stops by, makes small talk for a few minutes and invites me to lunch. I'm surprised. I get business lunches with managers, but not with directors, at least not since we had one I was good friends with. This one I just have a professional relationship with. And when I temporarily filled in as union steward a few years before, and he was still a manager, we had a few 'lively arguments'; water under the bridge as far as I'm concerned, but still. He's not one to show emotion either, who knows if that is mutual?\n\nBut anyhow, fully expensed lunch with martinis at a steakhouse while I'm paid on the clock? Even if he was my sworn nemesis I don't turn that down.\n\nWe discuss the department and operations a bit, he says my work is getting lots of praise from my manager, and then the purpose becomes clear:\n\n    Director: \"You know, you were very effective when you filled in as steward, you showed me you know the game, and you are very versatile. You can keep a cool head and put your foot down when you need to. Ever been interested in management?\"\n\nFor a second I'm surprised, I just came back from an extended sick leave months before, I'm well known to be close to the union (they usually are the ones to take me out to lunch), and I'm very good at my job but I have no experience in management whatsoever. But union employees are allowed to fill in on an 'interim basis' with a nice 20% bonus for several months, and it could get me in some meetings I'd be interested to sit in and behind some interesting closed doors. At that point they must resign to become full managers. I have no intention of resigning from my union position, but if I can play it right...\n\n    /u/bytewave [1] : \"Yeah, given the right conditions I could very well be, it could be a fun new challenge. We'd need to negotiate a few details. My current seniority would have to be carried over. I'd want my compensation package bump to take into account the considerable money I'm currently making from overtime, and be guaranteed as much time off as I have right now, and the usual.\"\n\nI get slightly sweaty palms, thinking I'm probably going in a little hard because of the martinis. Its still just the interim time I'm after. Wear a suit for 6 months, then turn a contract down and go back to my job? Could be fun and very informative.\n\n    Director: \"Full seniority might be an issue, you'd be bumping most managers in terms of schedule, but we could work something out. The rest would be perfectly doable.\"\n\n    /u/bytewave [2] : \"I could concede partial seniority and definitely be willing to work some graveyard shifts while I'm on my interim basis.\" After all, that's usually how it goes when they promote from the union.\n\n    Director: \"Interim basis? No, we're talking about terms for a contractual basis. Usually we start with 6 months but given your background and seniority I'm perfectly comfortable to double that.\"\n\nA one year contract? That means I'd have to resign from the union and he can throw my ass out in a year if he wants. The math adds up in a flash. He didn't like me as a union rep, he knows I'm still unofficially feeding the union all sorts of stuff, I've been gone nearly a year and since my paperwork was good I got full pay, I don't actually know how much he still dislikes me. The amount of money he readily suggested he was fine with is much higher than what a low-level suit gets. Either he's trying to buy me out to cut me off from the union and get some intel on his own, or it's a long con to \"not renew\" me in a year on some bullshit performance excuse.\n\n    /u/bytewave [3] : \"I see. There is plenty of precedent for letting union members have an interim basis before they resign, though. Given it's a new challenge, I want to be certain I'm fully tooled for this exciting opportunity before we sign a contract. Doesn't need for be 6 months, but I'd say, at least 3 or 4? Then I'm happy to go for the twelve months contract if we're both satisfied with my performance and the experience.\"\n\nHe pauses with a poker face.\n\n    Director: \"Unfortunately I can't really offer that right now, I need some form of commitment, there's been too much flux in my management team of late.\"\n\nYeah if you didn't hire idiots you then have to fire because they're the only ones who'll do the job for the kind of cheap money you want to pay them, your turnover rate would improve substantially.

I hope to be a good addition to this sub as well as bring fun ideas to the table. \n\n*****\n\nMy nerves were shot and coffee wasn't numbing the frequent interruptions that my project manager's kids were causing. I love kids don't get me wrong, but I had clients barking at me for not making their SharePoint site dispense cookies and trying desperately to keep within scoop and hours. After the 10th intercom call of a giggly little Indian girl saying I had I call it was getting old. My project manager who we'll call [Kairi](http://www.khextreme.co.uk/kh2/fmv/intro/KH2_Intro_High_Kairi3.jpg), because her real name resembles a characters name in the game Kingdom Hearts had her kids for the day because they didn't have school. Kairi is a very busy women most days so I don't blame her for not being able to keep an eye on her kids every second of the day. I finally decided to put on my headphones on to drown out the kids.  Pressed play on some Cure and tried to power through a task list when Thing One came up to my cube and pulled on my shirt. \n\n&gt;Hi. Um, sorry, but do you have Minecraft on that? \n\nI looked down at him. A kid who was bored out of his mind in a dull office that smelled musty from our roof leaking. I sympathized with him and thought about the times when my father had to bring me to his office during the summer. It really was to give my mother a break from my brothers and I, but I loved going. I loved the smell, the hum of computers, and the feeling of being surrounded by people working. Well, for the first hour at least. I quickly grew bored and thought of ways to fill my time. I was the biggest little shit around. I would pound on people's office windows around the surrounding complex of buildings, rid the elevator up and down, cherry pick all the good snacks from the break room, and messed with the receptionist. My father was the VP so everyone kinda had to put up with it. My father's fail safe to keep us out of his employees hair was to set my brothers and I up on different computers and install [Quake 2](http://egmr.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/makron.jpg) in a vacant training room.  We  had crazy Death Matches and Co-Ops that even system engineers were popping their heads in to watch. \n\nI looked down at Thing One seeing a mutual trapped feeling. \n\n&gt;Ya know. \n\nHis eyes widened\n\n&gt;I do actually.\n\nThing One grinned from ear to ear. \n\nI've made it a habit of bring my gaming laptop to work whenever I had large compiling work either with .Net or SQL compiles favoring my faster processing compared to my crappy [Lenovo G580](http://g-ec2.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/lenovo/G580_Black_HERO.jpg) speeds to do the work. I sent Kairi a quick Lync message outlining what I was planning and not two seconds later I got a mournful reply that said \"please...\" I set up Thing One up in one of our vacant training rooms with Thing Two in tow. I even connected up my laptop to the projector for maximized crafting. \n\nI left feeling better that I could get back to my work, but decided to stop by the break room and grab a snack. I sighed when I looked in the box of granola bars. The little shits took all the S'more granola bars...  \n\nRegards,\n\nGate77\n\n\n",

As much as I love /r/talesfromtechsupport I don't necessarily have too many tech/user stories. More general funny office setting stories.\n\n*****\n\nI work for a small MS consulting shop in a city that prides ourselves on manners and our population of lakes. My main job is a SharePoint Developer and am 1 out of 3 other developers here. Since I am only 4 months old to this job I reside in a grey cubical just opposite of my coworker who we'll call Putter because he always wears golf shirts and putts during his phone meetings. The other developer who we'll called TBK (The Bee Keeper) is just kitty corner to Putter's office that makes a triangle our boss calls the billable zone.\n\nTBK is a friendly ex-tank driver that owns a farm and is a walking encyclopedia of SP knowledge and Bees. One cold spring day TBK comes in holding a mesh box of something. He nodes good morning to me and walks to Putters office to talk about a project. I thought nothing of it until I had an uneasy feeling when I heard a buzzing noise from behind me. TBK was holding two mesh boxes of live bees. Putter and I shot each other a look after both realized what TBK was holding. Apparently there was a shipping error and instead of pick them up another day he had to pick them up today. \n\nAfter the initial shock it was kinda cool. We all huddled around them while he told us little facts and tidbits about bees. Later in the day is when things got a little troublesome. I was about to leave for lunch when I saw TBK's door shut, which was strange because he never shut his door. I put on my jacket and started to stroll past to see a mass of bees crawling on his window and TBK casually doing his work. I knocked on his door and mouthed \"are you okay?\" which he replied by waving his [hands in the air](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-UaVAV_z2McU/UQAcz5YfAvI/AAAAAAAAG0U/hbSdDCpcQ0g/s1600/michael-scott.gif). \n\nWe all got to leave early that day while TBK covered the bottom door crack with a towel and ran home to get his bee suit. \n\nApparently while checking on the top part of the bee box that holds food for them ([google image to show what im talking about. The round tin can thing.](http://www.sweetthievesbeekeeping.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Bee-Package.jpg)) wasn't put on very tight when TBK was checking on his children. \n\nEdit: Formatting \n",
