        "text": "Hello,\n\nI'm just starting to study history on my own since it's an interest of mine but the problem I keep running into is whitewashing. It seems to me that every country is busy with cleaning up their history by sweeping unsavory things under the rug. I mean, Holocaust deniers are a laughing stock now, but  Russia is still not acknowledging Soviet war crimes, Japan is still not acknowledging Japanese war crimes, UK is still not acknowleding British Empire crimes, USA is still not acknowledging their crimes, etc, and that's only concerning the relatively recent history. This makes me distrustful of history books because I never know what the author is omitting because of their own biases or agendas.\n\nI mean, I have even encountered this in my own country, Lithuania, we had history classes in school, and of course Holocaust was mentioned when we we're discussing the Nazi occupation, but if I remember correctly, there was no mention of the extent to which local population was complicit in exterminating the Jewish community, it was presented as that was what Nazis did all by themselves. How did I learn about the involvement of Lithuanians in Jewish genocide in Lithuania? On Reddit. WTF.\n\nHow can I get the truth (or as close as possible) about what really happened when I can't even get the relatively recent history of my own country right?\n\nI try to get around this somewhat by reading history books in different languages (say, a book on Soviet Union in English, in Russian, and in Lithuanian, they all present different stories) so there's that but what else can I do?\n\nP.S. I hope that's the right place to post this question since whitewashing leads to a lot of bad history.\n\nEDIT: Thank you everyone for your input, I learned a lot in this thread, and hopefully your advice will help me to get around whitewashing as much as possible! :)\n\n",

Well it is time to take chances, make mistakes and get messy because we are starting our own multiplayer game and everyone is welcome! \n\n**Although primarily intended as a form of therapy for historians affected by the library-of-Alexandria-syndrome this game may also be enjoyed recreationally by anyone interested.** ^(Disclaimer: Not supported by STEM science, any actual alleviation of symptoms are purely coincidental. Therapy not included in any reputable health plan.)\n\nAs of now this thread is mainly about the setup, primarily checking when most people have the time (presumably weekends but who knows what crazy times you guys have) and how long we should plan each session. You may try and pre-select countries but keep in mind that as times are still variable you might end up not making it so we'll do the final flag-distribution only after the rest is set in stone.\n\nFor your convenience I have created a quick multiple-choice poll. If you're interested in joining us [please vote here](http://goo.gl/forms/wPkDh7z8OI). I'm going to leave that poll up at least for the weekend so everyone has a chance to get their vote in, then when we have hopefully fixed some timeframe can we start properly picking countries. \n\nCommunication-wise I have no idea other what to do than the in-game chat so I'm open for all suggestions if someone has access to a TS server or something. Or everyone prefers to keep their mouth constantly filled with ethanol drinks, which is an acceptable alternative as usual.\n\nAnd finally, another thing concerning countries: I think it would be best to limit the playable country size by agreeing on a maximum base tax (you can see that [in the country selection screen here](http://i.imgur.com/ydSi5Oe.jpg)). For reference [here is a \\(hopefully\\) complete tax base list of the world](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19-exn0lHJXro5t2Ndfu2ROVa6S7eSWfAOaRXvIDTP5o/pubhtml) in 1444. My suggestion would be to cap it at 22, which would exclude all the obvious and boring early-game superpowers while still leaving loads of great smaller nations. Other than that, the world's your library to burn as they say.\n\nHappy voting and *all glory to the hypnomods*.\n\nEDIT:  \n- added [list of all countries](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19-exn0lHJXro5t2Ndfu2ROVa6S7eSWfAOaRXvIDTP5o/pubhtml) existing in 1444 sorted by general region and base tax  \n- plug for the [badhistory Steam group](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/badhistory) just because  \n- DLCs are not a requirement to play, multiplayer should share the host's with everyone on the server",

        "text": "It was suggested I post this in R/Badhistory, so here I am.\n\nThe post itself focuses on this scene from a documentary:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ymBF3nfhCU\n\nThe video is from a documentary series called Conquest, hosted by Peter Woodward, an actor who played Galen in the Babylon 5 spin-off, Crusade. The documentary itself is the sixth in the series, and focuses on the armour worn by a knight. It was also absolutely counter-factual.\n\nThe first reason for this that Peter Woodward himself, the individual who wrote, hosted and produced the series, has absolutely no academic credentials what-so-over. Whilst this itself is not a problem if an individual conducts himself with a rigour and discipline customary to the pursuit of history, Peter Woodward does not.\n\nThe second reason is the tests conducted against mail in the episode, which starts at 2.48. At all times the mail is positioned incorrectly. To properly test mail, it must be worn over or under padding (such as a quilted gambeson), and suspended in a manner that will reflect the human body: something somewhat soft and with some give (to represent a person instinctively stepping back from a blow. On the first test, the mail is hung from a branch. In the second, it is on a wooden rack. Neither replicate the conditions of mail worn by a person. Additionally, the mail appears to butted. Butted mail is always weak. Historically, mail was always riveted shut, which mean the rings would not break and not be pierced.\n\nThis video provides a more realistic positioning of mail:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kl-ec6Ub7FM\n\nNow, as for the hand-to-hand weapons testing, a lot was done wrong. if you noticed, the mail was suspended in a manner that allowed no cushioning that a body and padding would provide. The mail is also against a solid object, so when the spear hits the mail, the mail is caught between a solid point and a wall, entailing zero resistance. The axe strike is also done with a wood-axe, not a battle-axe. A battle-axe is light, smaller and balanced for fighting, a wood-axe is far too heavy and ungainly to be used in battle:\n\nhttp://www.hurstwic.org/history/articles/manufacturing/text/viking_axe.htm \n\nThe hit itself strikes the mail on collar where it is hanging down. Since the mail is butted, stationary and loose, it just tears. Something proper mail would not do. \n\nIn short, the video is complete garbage.\n\n\n\n",

It's a pity nobody ever bothered to make *Lawrence of Arabia* or the two *All Quiet on the Western Front*s or *War Horse* or *The Blue Max* or *Doctor Zhivago* or *The Monocled Mutineer* or the *Fall of Eagles* series or *Parade's End* or both film and television versions of both *Birdsong* and *Testament of Youth* or *Flyboys* or *Hell's Angels* or *Anzacs* or *Gallipoli* or *Beneath Hill 60* or *Joyeux Noel* or *The Trench* or *Wings* or *Passchendaele* or *The Lost Battalion* or *A Very Long Engagement* or who even knows.  Admittedly not all of these are modern or \"epic\", but many of them are at least one, if not both.  These are just off the top of my head; no doubt there are many more.\n\nStill, let's take the complaint at its most literal and assume that modern should mean *new*.  When will someone make a new WWI epic movie?  Well, recent works like *War Horse*, *Birdsong*, *Testament of Youth* etc. aside, lots of people *are* still making them.  Russell Crowe's *The Water Diviner* should be out soon, and is getting great reviews, and there's perennial talk of a new WWI film starring Daniel Radcliffe in some capacity.  Apparently Bradley Cooper is also attached to a novel film about American efforts to disrupt German espionage in the U.S.\n\nSo, people are making them.  There are plenty of both long- and short-scope projects being produced for television, too, with the BBC having aired *Passing Bells*, *The Crimson Field*, *The Village*, *Thirty-Seven Days* and *The Wipers Times* all within the last year or so.  All of these were at least interesting; some of them were actually quite good.\n\nAll of this aside, why can't they just make more of them?  When are we going to get a good WWI movie, guys?\n\nThe answer is **never**, apparently, because it's impossible to make one.\n\n&gt; WWI doesn't lend itself to action movie heroics as much as WWII. As one of the first and largest industrial wars, fought over so little with such disastrous consequences, WWI lends itself much more to grand tragedy and misery than to heroism. The Normandy scene in Saving Private Ryan works because the cause is heroic. In WWI, it would be purely tragic, which is not as appealing to a wide audience.\n\nWe find in this one of the first and most frequent problems involved in how people tend to assess the war's cinematic potential: the war is only a tragedy, full stop, and so cannot be as interesting as something that was apparently more upbeat.  There is no reason at all for this to be true, but people sure do love to say it.\n\nWe also find a subsidiary and equally common problem: the equation of the First World War with the experience of the infantry on the Western Front.  No other branches of service or operational theatres need apply, everyone; if it's not the mud and futility of the trenches in France and Flanders, it's not the First World War.\n\n&gt; There were no Nazis or Japanese as easily digestible bad guys.\n\nWhile this may be the case on a broad scale, one can find any number of acts of brutal evil or wickedness during the First World War if one is willing to look hard enough.  Can one really say that it would be impossible to accurately portray the Germans occupying Belgium in a negative light?  Or the Germans in East Africa?\n\nEven apart from this, I can understand the problem posed by a lack of \"easily digestible bad guys\"; obviously movies featuring belligerents with complex motives are uniformly terrible .  It's just one of the laws of nature.\n\n&gt; I think the big difficulty with WW1 is its static nature. Millions died, but little in the way of movement, in terms of fronts and lines. \n\nThis is not true in the slightest unless, again, you focus solely on the narrow strip of land running from the North Sea to the Swiss border.  The rest of the world also notably existed, and had many more things going on in it during the war -- many of them quite mobile.  My God, the untapped potential for an epic film about [the Serbian retreat of 1916](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbian_army%27s_retreat_through_Albania), or about Paul von Lettow Vorbeck's appalling campaign through Tanzania...\n\nBut no, nothing really happened, nobody really moved, nothing to make a movie about there.\n\n&gt; Jarhead is a modern equivalent of what a WW1 might look like, but look how badly that did.\n\nNooooooooo\n\n&gt; Also there is no real bad guy in WW1, except perhaps the ruling classes who dragged the continent into war for nothing more than a series of treaty violations (and a land grab in the imploding Ottoman Empire). Paths of Glory already covered that brilliantly, as well as Blackadder Goes Fourth.\n\n&gt; TLDR; Very little was achieved, The locations were dreary, life was miserable on both sides and no one was really the baddie.\n\nLeaving aside the doubtful need for a TL;DR on a comment that is only a few sentences long, I have to just declare that I can't fucking stand it.\n\n&gt; There is nothing \"epic\" in WWI. It was only soldiers living and dying in mud, getting killed by artillery strikes, diseases, and really really short assaults. Like, run 10m and get killed.\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; It was only soldiers living and dying in mud\n\n&gt;&gt; It was only\n\n&gt; only\n\nOh my god\n\n&gt; [Meanwhile, someone else is upset that T.E. Lawrence was white](http://np.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/2tdkbv/when_will_someone_make_a_modern_epic_wwi_movie/cny9a08?context=5)\n\nWhich, I... okay.  I guess?\n\nTo conclude, here is a non-exhaustive list of First World War events and figures that it would obviously be impossible to make a movie about:\n\n- The cruise of the *Wolf*, a powerful German raider disguised as a cargo ship that spent almost two years at sea conducting a series of pirate raids in every corner of the world.  The ship's captain fancied himself something of a knight of the ocean, and he and his crew conducted themselves with such courtesy throughout their campaign that many of the 800 prisoners they had taken by the war's end had become personal friends with them.  This, obviously, would make for a terribly dull movie.\n\n- The Battle of Jutland (1916), which saw the British and German fleets in the North Sea meet for their first and last serious engagement.  It was an absolutely devastating battle, full of near misses, heroics, sudden turn-abouts, and the outcome always poised on the edge of a knife.  Could there possibly *be* a more boring and unlikely subject for a movie?  I can't think of one.\n\n- On a smaller scale, the naval Battles of Coronel and the Falklands in November and December of 1914, which saw long running battles, brilliant maneuvers, sensational losses of life, unorthodox tactics, heroics, chivalry, brutality, romance -- everything that makes a story boring and not worth telling. \n\n- The Serbian retreat already mentioned above.\n\n- Pursuant to that, the life of Captain Flora Sandes, the only English woman to serve as an \"infantryman\" in uniform during the war.  Originally a volunteer nurse working with the Serbian army, she was summarily drafted into that army as a private during the retreat to ensure that she would receive proper rations and protection.  By the war's conclusion she had reached the rank of captain, and would receive the highest Serbian honour that can be awarded to a foreigner.\n\n- East Africa, also already mentioned.  Four years of guerrilla warfare in the sweltering jungle heat -- boring, I know, but we just have to scrape the bottom of the barrel here.\n\n- Speaking of which, the exploits of the absurdly eccentric Geoffrey Spicer-Simson, who dragged the tiny [HMS *Mimi* and *Toutou*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Mimi_and_HMS_Toutou) through the jungle to wage a tiny war for Lake Tanganyika.  This could be one of the most uninteresting movies ever made, if only anyone would bother. \n\n- We are periodically reminded that there was a war happening in the air as well as on the ground and at sea.  I can think of nothing that would be less exciting to see on the screen than aerial warfare, but maybe there's some pervert out there who would enjoy it.  \n\n- The [Siege of Kut Al Amara](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Kut)!  Wake me up when it's over, *please*.\n\n- The offensive of the last hundred days of the war, which saw all of the mobility and victory and sensational turnabout and ferocious action that we're apparently supposed to expect in a war epic.  I'm sure they'll get right on this.^1\n\nPlease list more!  I mean, if you can -- it's impossible, after all.\n\n^1 - No they won't; the fact that the war ended with some of the most tremendous victories in the history of the British infantry (among others) is nowhere to be found in the popular memory of the war, so it's not likely that they'll be making a film about it any time soon.",

        "text": "In the Twin Cities of Minnesota (or as a reporter from New York once said \"a Siberia unfit for human habitation\") there is a local news story going around about a father's Youtube response to his daughter being racially bullied.  The father of the bullied contacted the father of the bully and then received some nasty voicemails from the man.  These voicemails were played on Youtube (with the alleged consent of both parties) and the father of the bully lost his job over them.\n\nThis is especially ironic in America, where\n&gt;This country was founded on the basis that a King should not be allowed to tell you what you can and cannot say\n\nfound in [this comment](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/TwinCities/comments/2t8upp/frustrated_prior_lake_father_posts_video_on_his/cnx6nu2).  Wait a second, what was the basis of the foundation of America?\n\nAs important as free speech was to the American revolutionaries, it certainly was not the basis of the foundation of the USA.  England was well-known at the time for having an extremely outspoken and critical press.  Alexander Hamilton acknowledged this in Federalist Paper 84 when he stated\n&gt;it is notorious that the press nowhere enjoys greater liberty than in [Great Britain].\n\nWhen arguing against the inclusion of the Bill of Rights, Hamilton's thesis was that\n&gt;The truth is...that the Constitution is itself, in every rational sense, and to every useful purpose, A BILL OF RIGHTS.\n\nThe main objective of the Constitution was creating a stable, effective government where hopefully guarantees like freedom of speech would be unnecessary.  The Revolution and drafting of the Constitution were not reactions to infringement of freedom of speech; they were reactions against a body that could never practically and fairly rule over a people 3000 miles away.\n\nFurthermore, it wasn't the King that initially started the conflict with the colonists.  From 1763-1775, it was acts of *Parliament*, not the King, that continued to infuriate the colonists.  Before declaring independence, the colonists even reached out (albeit half-heartedly) to the King with the [Olive Branch Petition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olive_Branch_Petition) in an appeal to him to mediate the dispute.  As it turned out, King George III wasn't very sympathetic to the colonists' cause.  Still, to label the King as the sole enemy in the Revolutionary War is very inaccurate.   In Samuel Adams' 1772 [Report on the Committee of Correspondence](http://www.constitution.org/bcp/right_col.htm), he spends paragraphs outlining what a *legislative body* can and cannot do, perhaps effectively summed up by\n&gt;The Legislative cannot justly assume to itself a power to rule by extempore arbitrary decrees.\n\nIf we had to choose either the King or Parliament (which thankfully we don't need to do), Parliament was the body that most inflamed the colonists' passion for independence.\n\nLater on, we get [the statement](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/TwinCities/comments/2t8upp/frustrated_prior_lake_father_posts_video_on_his/cnxk7z3)\n&gt;I believe the emphasis behind the original founding of the country was to monetarily benefit the founders.\n\nWhen did Mr. Zinn walk into the room?  I thought your opinion was that the basis of the founding of the country was freedom of speech.  Regardless, if George Washington's long game was to make profit, why would he decline a salary for his command and also decline the opportunity to become king or dictator after the war was over?  I think John Adams' writings demonstrate that he at least felt strongly about liberty and fair governance.  Besides his [Thoughts on Government](http://www.constitution.org/jadams/thoughts.htm) or contributions to state constitutions, there is also this famous excerpt from his diary after visiting the site of the decisive Parliamentary victory from the First English Civil War\n&gt;The people in the neighborhood appeared so ignorant and careless at Worcester that I was provoked and asked 'And do Englishmen so soon forget the ground where liberty was fought for? Tell your neighbors and your children that this is holy ground, much holier than that on which your churches stand. All England should come in pilgrimage to this hill, once a year.\n\nClearly John Adams was a man looking to get rich quick!  Finally, to rest my case, I present John Hancock.  His opposition to the British government had nothing to do with financial interests.  Rather, he was vehemently opposed to Parliament's encroachments on one of his great passions: smuggling.  Okay, maybe John Hancock is a bad example.\n\nAnyway, that's a lot of writing to dispute only two sentences of bad history.  It's just such a cliche to talk about Americans fighting for \"freedom of (insert agenda here)\" or that it was just a bunch of old white guys trying to stage a coup.  Although many of the founders were political idealists, there were many more tangible reasons for why they felt the need for independence.  We don't need to bounce from one extreme ([FREEDOM!!!!](http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/image/5750750-3x2-700x467.jpg)) to another ([Founders as arch puppet masters](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/d1/Puppet_Master-_Axis_of_Evil.jpg)).",

        "text": "So rather than posting this to conspiratard I thought this would do well here in badhistory instead because it... almost sounds reasonable? We're always learning new things about the past, there's always new papers being declassified every year or so. So while reading a thread earlier earlier I went \"huh\" because I knew the lunatics in the FBI had a real hateboner for MLK and were apparently in some kind of campaign to discredit him at various times. So I decided to look up some information on this trial mentioned and... it turned out it wasn't some sort of hushed up criminal trial against the FBI/CIA/whatever. It was a civil trial. That started because some dude wanted a bit o' fame. It's not like most conspiracy theories, since the trial DID happen, and the jury DID say 'yes' to Jowers version of events happening. It's bad history on everyone's part because it is based on misrepresenting statements, claiming a criminal trial happened (which didn't, btw), and making up facts to suit an agenda... which I guess could also go for conspiracies too. Hmmm.\n\n[So here's a link to the thread in question.](http://bogleech.tumblr.com/post/108759658343/anarcho-queer-nicolestop-i-friend-of-mine)\n\nAnd here is a nice little chunk to read.\n\n&gt; I friend of mine were having a chat and she brought up that the US Government was found  guilty of the murder of Martin Luther King in 1999 and this year this info started to re-surface and multiple people were taking extensive efforts to make sure the information stayed hidden. I did some research and here’s what I found. In 1999 (a year after the person convicted of the assassination, James Earl Ray, died) the United States government was taken to court by King’s family. With a very short trial, due to the overwhelming evidence against the government, they were found guilty.\n\nHere's our little snag. The US Government wasn't actually found guilty, the jury just went \"yup sure some unknown government agencies maybe whatever\". Also there's the fact tumblr treats it like a criminal trial, which it was not. There was no 'overwhelming evidence' against the government since Jowers *couldn't even keep his story straight.* The government wasn't even defending itself, it was a trial against Jowers. The jury was working on almost no solid evidence ~~and the fact they awarded the King family only $100 dollars is more of a sign of how much people really believed in the conspiracy (ie not much).~~\n\n&gt;You can read more about the trial [here](http://newsone.com/2843790/did-you-know-us-govt-found-guilty-in-conspiracy-to-assassinate-dr-martin-luther-king-jr/). And if anyone tries to disprove this news source, google “us government killed MLK” and you’ll have a plentiful of articles from 1999-2014 covering this topic more than I ever could in a tumblr post.\n\nFor this I just want to say I can go look up 'Aliens Killed JFK' and get around 450,000 hits, and also 'Hitler Lives' brings back 33,900,000 hits. So telling people to just google it isn't exactly going to prove anything more then a lot of people think Hitler made it to 74 and lived in Costa Rica for the rest of his life under an assumed name.\n\nAnd here are my sources. [The Justice Department](http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/crm/mlk/part6.php), and good old [Snopes](http://www.snopes.com/politics/conspiracy/mlktrial.asp). For the MLK thing. Not for Hitler living in Costa Rica. We all know he went to Sweden.\n\n\n**EDIT**\n\n/u/ANewMachine615 gives some good corrections and also a bit more detail.\n\n&gt; A few points, coming at this from an attorney's viewpoint:\n&gt;&gt; The jury was working on almost no solid evidence, and the fact they awarded the King family only $100 dollars is more of a sign of how much people really believed in the conspiracy (ie not much).\n\n&gt;No, the King family only asked for $100, supposedly to show that this wasn't about the money. They couldn't give more than $100 because that's all that was sued for.\nSecond, the big issue has to do with the evidence presented. Basically, both sides in the case alleged a government conspiracy, just with Jowers' role differing slightly. The way juries are supposed to work is that they decide based solely on the information presented to them. Moreover, they have to find not based on what is reasonable or likely, but on which side presents the stronger evidence on a point. If, based solely on the evidence before them, a given fact is more likely than not to be true, the jury should find that fact to be true, in a basic civil case.\nSo if Jowers gets up and says \"yep, it was a government conspiracy,\" and the King family says \"Yep, sure was a government conspiracy,\" then the jury is compelled to find -- for the purposes of that trial -- that there was a government conspiracy. That will hold no water whatsoever in any other venue, because a central party (the government conspirators) had no opportunity to defend themselves, but for the purposes of that trial, it holds up. Hell, in the same position I would've filed a pre-trial motion setting that fact as a given, so that I didn't even need to present evidence on it at trial. Simplifies everything, and is really just good practice to limit the number of things you have to do any work on. However, the attorneys involved were about making a point, rather than doing good and efficient work, so...",

With this post, I’m moving further away from Restall’s *Seven Myths of the Spanish Conquest*. If you see any errors, let me know so I can fix them and learn from my mistakes. Scholars of the Americas, feel free to add information from your areas of research.\n\nHere we go…\n\n**The Myth: Missions, the Full Measure of Desolation**\n\nIn the popular narrative of a post-apocalyptic post-contact wasteland, the mission experience emerges as a special kind of hell. Per the myth, in the missions death abounds in a place designed to rid the Americas of the corrupting influence of indigenous cultures. Powerful, oppressive friars violently remove all evidence of Native American spiritual practice, replacing rich and diverse cultures with a uniform, boring manifestation of Christianity unintelligible to their native charges. Native Americans are forced to abandon indigenous clothing, food resources, recreation, and culture while they toil in the fields of the Lord. Resistance is met with the lash, or the sword, as a beaten, haggard people gradually pass away in a state of anomie.\n\nThe third post, Completed Conquest, examined the incomplete nature of conquest and the constant threat of violent resistance throughout the empire. The fifth post, Native Desolation, provided an overview of the context for survival, adaption, and persistence in native communities immediately after contact. This post will combine the two to examine the politics behind the missions in Florida, as well as evidence for non-violent resistance that reveals a deeper, nuanced picture of life in the shadow of the cross.\n\n**The Reality: Negotiation, Autonomy, and Resistance in the Missions**\n\nAfter the excesses of cruelty seen in the initial years of contact, the 1573 Comprehensive Royal Orders for New Discoveries placed missionaries at the forefront of exploration/pacification of new lands. Franciscans and Jesuits became conquistadores of the spirit along the northern borderlands in [Florida](http://uwf.edu/jworth/spanfla_missions.jpg), [Texas](http://media.maps101.com/SUB/txatlas/24SpanishMissions.gif), [New Mexico](http://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/cultural_diversity/photos/Trail%20Map.jpg) along the Rio Grande, [southern Arizona](http://www.nps.gov/parkhistory/online_books/hutr/clr/images/fig7.jpg), and [Alta California](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/1920_Alta_California_mission_trail.jpg) (links for fun maps). In the fight to complete the conquest, the Crown believed missionaries could pacify land at less cost, and with a greater impact, than soldiers. The missions provided a spiritual harvest, as well as a vital frontier presence against encroachment from other European nations. The southwestern colonies protected lucrative mining enterprises in Northern Mexico, and Florida provided a safe haven/support for ships crossing the Atlantic. For this protection, New Mexico lost the Crown 2,390,000 pesos in the 17th century alone. Florida cost four times as much (Weber).\n\nThough covering a wide geographic range, the total number of missionaries remained small; never more than 70 at a time for Florida, and &lt; 50 for New Mexico. Alta California represents a unique case given the late expansion to confront Russian merchants in San Francisco Bay, and reveals a bit about the ideal Franciscan mission demographics. In Alta California \n\n&gt; the mission typically housed two friars (the majority from Spain), a mission guard of six soldiers (most of whom were mestizos or mulattos of Spanish, African, and/or native ancestry from northern Mexico), and a thousand or more baptized Indians or neophytes (Lightfoot, p. 5) \n\nIsolated on the fringe of the known world, the remote colonies featured interactions not always possible in the heart of the empire. Here, on the ragged edge, survival depended on negotiation and accommodation from all parties. Even something as [rigid as the *castas* racial system](http://figures.boundless.com/5850/full/casta-painting-all.jpe) relaxed on a frontier where *calidad* (social status) could be defined by occupation and wealth, not just ancestry and skin color (Weber, p. 327-8).\n\nOf course, one person’s frontier is another’s home. Analysis of Native North Americans in mission communities requires one to walk a tightrope of sorts. On the one hand, missions are viewed as primarily carceral institutions completely under European control and designed to extinguish indigenous cultures. Any evidence of persistence and acculturation reinforces the narrative of European actors and Native American re-actors/victims. Conversely, focusing only on resistance “in nearly every part of daily life is counterproductive and only serves to reinforce the idea of a bounded, carceral mission landscape” (Panich &amp; Schneider, p.21). The tightrope, then, is to describe how Native Americans actively negotiated Spanish colonialism on their own terms. We must examine how Native Americans incorporated, or decided against incorporating, missions into the indigenous system of power, belief, exchange, subsistence, and residence (Panich &amp; Schneider, p. 10).\n\n*The Missions of La Florida*\n\nOn a large scale, the missions of Florida illustrate negotiation between the indigenous power structure and the Spanish mission system. Before contact sedentary, maize-based agricultural populations ruled by paramount chiefdoms dominated much of the southeast. Pedro Menéndez de Avilés arrived in Florida in 1565 with the mandate to establish a Spanish presence that would both prevent French colonization of the Atlantic coast, and protect the treasure-laden Fleet of the Indes as it passed through the Bahama Channel. With neither the people nor resources to effectively do so, and constrained by the Empire’s annoying “don’t abuse the natives” policy, Spain entered into the Mississippian political world. \n\nLa Florida was no theocracy. Full-functioning Native towns permitted a Spanish mission presence as a means of levering the Spanish Empire and the Catholic Church as allies against rival chiefdoms. Archaeologist John Worth suggests the \n\n&gt; Franciscan friars stationed in La Florida functioned like the modern Peace Corps, being granted voluntary admittance into Native American communities to assist in the transition to the new colonial world.\n\nIn the Mississippian tradition, chiefly rulers controlled subordinates and accepted tribute, with ostentatious displays of wealth indicating their ability to mobilize resources/validating their right to rule. By placing themselves in a position to channel excess production to the colonial government, in this case maize Spanish friars and colonists needed to not starve, *caciques* received high status items in return such as cloth, tools, and beads.\n\n&gt; Simply stated, then, the colonial Spanish system in La Florida reinforced internal chiefly power… by pledging allegiance and obedience to Spanish officials, indigenous Timucua, Mocama, and Guale chiefs annexed a powerful military ally in the Spanish garrison at St. Augustine (Panich &amp; Schneider, p. 29-30)\n\nFranciscan missionaries functioned in a role similar to Mississippian religious specialists, and bridged the cultural gap between the Mississippian world and Spanish culture, while hereditary chiefs maintained secular authority. Far from lifeless desolation, *caciques* leveraged Spanish alliances to compete for prominence among their neighbors for more than a century. The end of the Florida missions came in the form of English slavers and their native allies. Slavers began attacking the missions in the seventeenth century, leading to the rapid collapse of the Florida mission system.\n\n*Autonomy in Small Things*\n\nThe everyday acts of mission inhabitants show how autonomy was negotiated along the northern frontier. As the last post mentioned, “Indians accepted one aspect of Spanish colonization in order to facilitate their rejection of another” (Restall). Missionaries likewise accepted one aspect of Native American rebellion, while stressing obedience on another, typically public, front. \n\nFor example, official regulations required baptized Native American inhabitants of the missions to live on the premises, and procure a pass for permission to leave the mission. Escaped neophytes could be pursued, returned to the mission, and subject to corporal punishment. In North America, however, mission authorities often realized the impossibility of enforcing this law. Depending upon place and time, mission Indians negotiated absence from the mission to forage for traditional foods, maintain familial connections, and continue religious practice away from the eyes of the friars. \n\nMission policy required neophytes to integrate European crops into existing native agricultural practices. Bluntly stated, they should eat like Christians. Mission inhabitants resisted this demand by complementing their mission diets with foraged foods consumed in private residences. In a place where we imagine desolation abounded, this small act of rebellion indicates access to the surrounding landscape, ongoing knowledge of local resources, and small-scale trade conducted outside the control of mission authorities. Remains of acorns, seeds, fruits, fish, shellfish, waterfowl, and game have been found in mission residential structures from Florida to California. This private rebellion was known to mission officials, who often decided not to press an issue they couldn’t enforce. At Mission San Antonio in California the fathers noted “in private, in their own houses, they prepare their seeds which are of good quality and in abundance such as acorns, sage, chia, pine nuts and others” and remained “very fond of the food they enjoyed in their pagan state” (Panich &amp; Schneider, p.15).\n\nLiberty from the missions also allowed the continuation of religious ceremonies. In New Mexico, Cochiti oral history tells of moving dances and rituals to the hinterlands away from the missions. In Texas and California, this act of resistance was well known to the friars, who were powerless to prevent the practice. Fermín Francisco de Lasuén, president of the Alta California missions, wrote “if we absolutely denied them the right to go to the mountains, I am afraid they would riot” (Panich &amp; Schneider, p. 17). Instead of a fearful, captive population, Lightfoot estimates five to ten percent of the total Alta California neophyte population became runaways at some point. As a compromise on official regulations, Alta California instituted *paseo* (approved leave of absence), and granted mission inhabitants furloughs for five to ten weeks a year. Far from desolate, this small measure of autonomy underscores the constant compromise between neophytes and the Spanish missionaries. Native Americans negotiated, in both official and covert ways, freedom of movement and space to continue religious practice.\n\nThe separation of public and private lives is echoed throughout the mission system in North America. At Mission San Buenaventura in California oral tradition indicates weddings consisted of two marriage ceremonies; one public Catholic ritual, and a private native ceremony held inside the neophyte residences. The public/private dichotomy in San Buenaventura included a variety of religious ceremonies and sacred dances. Some dances were officially permitted for performance before the entire mission community, while others were hidden, performed in inner plazas/alleys or within residential structures. Archaeology and ethnohistory show Native American neophytes, from the highest rank *alcaldes* to poorest orphan, constantly negotiated this double life of public accommodation while maintaining private autonomy. Archaeologically, we find evidence of a private life in the foods, tools, ornaments/clothing, and ceremonial paraphernalia that indicate the continuation of native practices and identity, even among devout Catholics who publicly rose to high social status in the mission hierarchy (Lightfoot).  \n\n*Wrapping Up*\n\nIn both the larger reasons for accepting Spanish missionaries, and the smaller acts of resistance and accommodation, a richer story of life in the missions emerges. Rather than a spiritless, desolate native population, we see evidence for vital communities negotiating for autonomy and continuing to adapt. *Alcaldes* who used the mission system to gain public social status negotiated a far different private world where outlawed indigenous traditions continued hidden from the eyes of the padres. Florida *caciques* hoped to harness the power of Spain and the Catholic Church by admitting missionaries to their communities, while simultaneously refusing a full transition to Spanish lifeways. \n\nToo often the narrative of conquest focuses on illness, violence, and death. Yes, there was death, and oppression, and disease, but this was not a terminal population waiting for the end. Here, in the missions, history, ethnohistory, and archaeology combine to highlight rich evidence of life: a mission abounding with gambling, games, dances, feasts, hidden performances, and religious ceremonies (Lightfoot).\n\nMore myths of conquest to come.

        "text": "/r/vegan had an interesting discussion recently about indigenous peoples and their traditional hunts. It's a question that, for missionary vegans, is a subject of great debate. It's also a fantastic source of bad history. Like [this post!](http://np.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/2q6c1p/what_do_you_think_of_the_inuit/cn39eel) I'll say that there is plenty of bad history on both sides of the...discussion of Japanese whaling, but let's just use this post claiming that Japanese whaling is a recent phenomenon as a jumping off point for a discussion of Japanese whaling more generally.\n\nSo what can be said about whaling in Japan? Is it strictly a product of the 19th century? Well, not quite. While it is true that it was ritualised and considered a sacred act in many places, it wasn't exactly rare. Evidence from Jōmon burial mounds dating to around 12000 BCE shows that people from this time period ate and used whales at least that early in their history. However, it's highly unlikely that people were actively hunting whales, seeing as whales are large and scary and tend not to want to be caught. Instead, it's likely that people were scavenging from beached whales. However, even this helped establish whales as a creature of immense spiritual importance. For the Ainu on Hokkaido, especially, whales became represented within a pantheon of gods as well as becoming an indelible part of Ainu cuisine. The Kojiki - which dates to 712 CE - also talks about emperors eating whales, once again implying that it wasn't exactly an unknown thing to the Japanese. In addition to that, a 1489 cookbook includes a recipe that uses whale meat.\n\nNow, that said, the fact that emperors and such were eating whale meat doesn't necessarily mean that it wasn't marginalised. Certainly it was also ritualised, but once again, that doesn't translate to being marginal. What we see in tombs and archaeological evidence is that, in some societies on the Japanese islands, whales represented a not insignificant part of life. \n\nThe involvement of whales would increase as new technologies made whaling more feasible. In the 12th century, for instance, special hand-held whaling harpoons were invented that made whaling expeditions more efficient. By the early 17th century, whaling became even more efficient as new techniques developed in Taiji (in Wakayama) began to proliferate. These techniques involved herding a whale into nets and exhausting it until harpoons and a boy with a knife could finish it off. It would then be towed to the shore where it would be ritually butchered and have prayers said over it. This butchering would involve setting aside most parts of the whale to be used in some form or another, be it as leather, oil, meat, or even pesticides. This method continued to flourish and bring economic prosperity to some coastal regions throughout the Tokugawa period, or until the mid-19th century. \n\nTo be clear, there are a lot of myths about these whaling techniques and this period in Japanese whaling history. The most prevalent of these myths is the idea that this form of whaling was relatively harmless and less destructive than equivalent Western techniques. While it is true that Japanese methods did ensure that more of the whale was used, it wasn't necessarily any less devastating for whale populations. For instance, the coastal whalers had a tendency to target calves, as it meant that the adults would follow and more whales could be caught at the same time. This, understandably, created problems for the whale populations that were being hunted, and the population declined drastically. This population decline would only increase as Japan adopted more modern techniques for its whaling.\n\nIn the early 20th century, a man named Juro Oka brought Norwegian whaling techniques back to Japan, jumpstarting the modern Japanese whaling industry. These techniques involved the use of industrial scale weapons and slaughter techniques, as well as new motorised boats. These new technologies were partly in response to the fact that the populations around the Japanese islands had become utterly decimated, necessitating expeditions that when farther and farther out into the open ocean (though you'll see some...ah...\"debate\" about whose fault it is that there were no more whales). All these technologies made whale hunting more efficient and productive, increasing the number of whales that could be - and were - caught.\n\nIn the wake of WWII, however, whaling became even more popular as a source of meat for a devastated country. Up until the mid-1960s, it was a staple food in government provided meals, such as school lunches and army rations. It also became an ingredient in sashimi, and \"koro\" (dried whale fat) became a primary ingredient in some soups. However, as other meats became more affordable, whale meat declined in popularity, falling behind beef, chicken, and pork. That said, whale meat is still eaten at special celebrations in several coastal communities which have traditionally relied on whaling. Communities like Taiji still consume whale meat at weddings and new year's celebrations. \n\nThe Japanese commercial whaling fleet was dissolved in November 1987 under mounting international pressure, but this is not to say that Japanese whaling has ended. Japan continued - and continues - to conduct whaling under the pretence of research. I'd talk more about it, but I know full well that that would ram headfirst into rule 2, and I do try to be on my best behaviour. \n\nWhat I will say, though, is that Japanese whaling represents an interesting question about the use of historical data. Certainly there is a lot of propaganda on both sides of the whaling debate, with some people saying this is an indelible part of Japanese heritage, and others saying it's a modern import. There's elements of truth in both perspectives. More importantly, though, is that what data there is is invariably viewed through one lens or another. There aren't too terribly many unbiased sources that I could find. Western sources usually write from a perspective of upholding anti-whaling conventions, and Japanese sources write from a perspective of justifying the practice as tradition. It means that history itself gets clouded and distorted behind the lens of modern politics. Because of the emotion of the issue, the actual, objective history - assuming there is such a thing - is lost. \n\nHowever, we can glean at least some of the truth from all these different bits of propaganda and wishful thinking. It is fair to say that whaling in Japan is older than the 19th century, and that many coastal communities did indeed rely on whaling throughout the Tokugawa period and earlier. Equally, it's also fair to say that whale meat was not always an indelible part of Japanese national cuisine - it certainly had its place after WWII, but that faded away to be replaced by other meats. What truth there is could perhaps best be understood as saying that some parts of Japan really liked whales. Other parts didn't care. But the country as a whole was and remains a diverse place with different culinary interests. Also, whaling was totally a thing.\n\nSources!\n\nI know I didn't do any in-text citations (naughty me), but here is some more reading if you're interested in learning about the history of Japanese whaling and the controversies surrounding not only the modern practice, but the interpretation and use of historical data. \n\n\"Japanese whaling: saving whales in a clash of cultures\" by Kirsten Englund and Kathy Glass, published in *Whole Earth Review*\n\n\"Culture wars: Japan claims the whale hunt is its cultural heritage.

(If you hear the click-clack of a keyboard in the distance, that's the sound of Dan Brown furiously writing a new best-seller).\n___________________________\nHorace has some great quotes. \"Carpe Diem.\" \"Begin, be bold, and venture to be wise.\" My personal favorite, \"wisdom is not wisdom when it is derived from books alone.\" [And this beautiful and moving quote, found on a doorway in my highschool.](http://puu.sh/eNFB5/50019e7491.png)\n\nFor those who may be unable to make out the words, it says:\n\n&gt;It is God who can transform the lowest into the highest, Who humbles the proud, and causes that which is in darkness to become light.\n\n&gt;--Horace\n\nFrom the context it is being used in (a motivational message at a Jesuit highschool), it would appear that Horace is referring not to his contemporary Roman gods, but rather to a specific, capital-G God: the God of Christianity.\n\nNow, some of you may be slightly confused at this point. Horace was not a Christian. ^^^source: ^^^every ^^^book ^^^about ^^^Horace, ^^^ever What did he believe in? Most likely the Roman gods, and certainly not one single god. He promoted reverence to the gods in his works, and his *Odes* were filled with references and poems praising the gods^^^[source](http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/horace). This is coupled with the fact that he died around 8 BC^^^[source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horace), at *least* a year before any estimate I've seen regarding Jesus' birth. Obviously the Christian faith does not predate Jesus (y'know, the 'Christ' in 'Christianity'), so Horace certainly was not a proponent of the Christian faith/God.\n\n Adding to the difficulty of discerning the meaning of this quote is the fact that I can't find any source for it, anywhere. Google returned three results for parts of the quote; none of the results had a citation or even mentioned Horace's works. Even searching full texts of his complete works returns nothing.\n\nBut this is not an English class, where we mock people for failing to properly cite quotes. This is /r/badhistory, where we mock people for failing their Roman history course.\n\nAt this point, it seems that there are two possibilities regarding the nature of this quote.\n\n1. It's a harmless piece of Bad History (with a dash of Bad Religion and, I dunno, Bad Writing? thrown in for good measure) which has somehow evaded the attentions of the entire Latin and History departments at my school. If this is the case the best course of action is probably to subtly mention it to someone and hope something gets done. Or just straight up vandalize it, in the name of history, of course. [Here are some possibilities for the latter.](http://imgur.com/a/xR8k9)\n\n2. The other, far more likely possibility is that Horace was actually a prophet of Christianity who worshiped Jesus before he even existed. Some brave Freemason probably painted this fake quote as a clue to start a historical adventure that would reveal startling insights into the lives of prominent historical figures (fun fact: Alexei Romanov was actually Rasputin's son) before ultimately culminating with the revelation that George Washington and George III were the same person (he just had  schizophrenia). I'm sure if I were to examine the rest of the quotes scattered around my school I'd find more evidence pointing to tantalizing historical facts.\n\nThat's all for today, folks. Keep an eye out for the book version, coming out sometime next year.\n\n\"Never trust anything in quotation marks\" -- Dan Brown.",

Fireworks were first documented to be used in [7th century China.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fireworks#History) Whereas,\n&gt;[Paper-making is known to have been traced back to China about 105 CE, when Cai Lun, an official attached to the Imperial court during the Han Dynasty (202 BCE-220 CE), created a sheet of paper using mulberry and other bast fibres along with fishnets, old rags, and hemp waste.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papermaking#History)  \n\nSo, supposedly, the Chinese never invented anything after the 7th century AD, amirite??? Well...\n&gt;[Development of the banknote began in the Tang Dynasty during the 7th century, with local issues of paper currency, although true paper money did not appear until the 11th century, during the Song Dynasty.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banknote#Early_Chinese_paper_money)\n\nI'm pretty sure paper banknotes were invented after paper...\n\n[Also, bombs.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bomb#History)\n&gt;Explosive bombs were used in China in 1221, by a Jin Dynasty army against a Song Dynasty city. Bombs built using bamboo tubes appear in the 11th century.\n\nCertainly after the invention of both paper and fireworks, right? Well, you also have the [sport of Chuiwan.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuiwan)\n&gt;The book Dongxuan lu, written by Wei Tai (fl. 1050–1100) of the Song Dynasty, describes how a southern Tang official teaches his daughter how to dig goals in the ground and drive a ball into them.\n\nOther stuff invented/discovered by the Chinese after both fireworks and paper:  \n\n1 . [Using coke as a fuel.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coke_%28fuel%29#China)\n&gt;By the first decades of the eleventh century, Chinese ironworkers in the Yellow River valley began to fuel their furnaces with coke, solving their fuel problem in that tree-sparse region.\n\n2 . [Dominoes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominoes#History)\n&gt;The oldest confirmed written mention of dominoes in China comes from the Former Events in Wulin (i.e. the capital Hangzhou) written by the Yuan Dynasty (1271–1368) author Zhou Mi (1232–1298), who listed \"pupai\" (gambling plaques or dominoes) as well as dice as items sold by peddlers during the reign of Emperor Xiaozong of Song (r. 1162–1189).\n\n3 . [The Fire Lance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_lance#History)\n&gt;The first fire-lances were seen in China during the 10th century\n\nOk, I'm not going to go too deep into gunpowder-related devices from here on, because there are a ton of them invented after fireworks(makes sense, because fireworks were one of the earliest uses of gunpowder.)  \n4 . [Smallpox inoculation.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inoculation#China)\n&gt;Joseph Needham states that a case of inoculation for smallpox may have existed in the late 10th century during the Song Dynasty (960–1279), yet they rely on a book Zhongdou xinfa written in 1808 by Zhu Yiliang for this evidence. Wan Quan (1499–1582) wrote the first clear reference to smallpox inoculation in his Douzhen xinfa of 1549.\n\n5 . [The Chinese Magic Mirror.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_magic_mirror)\n&gt;In about 800 AD, during the Tang dynasty (618–907), a book entitled Record of Ancient Mirrors described the method of crafting solid bronze mirrors with decorations, written characters, or patterns on the reverse side that could cast these in a reflection on a nearby surface as light struck the front, polished side of the mirror; due to this seemingly transparent effect, they were called \"light-penetration mirrors\" by the Chinese.\n\n6 . [Mahjong.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahjong#China)\n&gt;One theory is that Chinese army officers serving during the Taiping Rebellion created the game to pass the time. Another theory is that a nobleman living in the Shanghai area created the game between 1870 and 1875. Others believe that two brothers from Níngpō created mahjong around 1850, from the earlier game of Mǎdiào.\n\n7 . [Playing cards](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playing_card#Early_history)\n&gt;Playing cards were invented in Imperial China. They were found in China as early as the 9th century during the Tang Dynasty (618–907).\n\n8 .

        "text": "To clarify the title, this post is about history that gets politicized, making it bad.\n\n1st post, so here goes:\n\nMy father made the statement a few days ago that the founding fathers were tortured by the British. I couldn't believe this bullshit, so I decided to check it out. Here's the full text from a chain email sent around concerning this.\n\n\"Have you ever wondered what happened to the 56 men who signed the Declaration of Independence?\n\nFive signers were captured by the British as traitors, and tortured before they died. Twelve had their homes ransacked and burned. Two lost their sons in the revolutionary army, another had two sons captured. Nine of the 56 fought and died from wounds or hardships of the revolutionary war. They signed and they pledged their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor.\n\nWhat kind of men were they? Twenty-four were lawyers and jurists. Eleven were merchants, nine were farmers and large plantation owners, men of means, well educated. But they signed the Declaration of Independence knowing full well that the penalty would be death if they were captured.\n\nCarter Braxton of Virginia, a wealthy planter and trader, saw his ships swept from the seas by the British Navy. He sold his home and properties to pay his debts, and died in rags.\n\nThomas McKeam was so hounded by the British that he was forced to move his family almost constantly. He served in the Congress without pay, and his family was kept in hiding. His possessions were taken from him, and poverty was his reward.\n\nVandals or soldiers looted the properties of Ellery, Hall, Clymer, Walton, Gwinnett, Heyward, Ruttledge, and Middleton.\n\nAt the battle of Yorktown, Thomas Nelson Jr., noted that the British General Cornwallis had taken over the Nelson home for his headquarters. He quietly urged General George Washington to open fire. The home was destroyed, and Nelson died bankrupt.\n\nFrancis Lewis had his home and properties destroyed. The enemy jailed his wife, and she died within a few months.\n\nJohn Hart was driven from his wife's bedside as she was dying. Their 13 children fled for their lives. His fields and his gristmill were laid to waste. For more than a year he lived in forests and caves, returning home to find his wife dead and his children vanished. A few weeks later he died from exhaustion and a broken heart. Morris and Livingston suffered similar fates.\n\nSuch were the stories and sacrifices of the American Revolution. These were not wild eyed, rabble-rousing ruffians. They were soft-spoken men of means and education. They had security, but they valued liberty more. Standing tall, straight, and unwavering, they pledged: \"For the support of this declaration, with firm reliance on the protection of the divine providence, we mutually pledge to each other, our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred honor.\"\n\nThey gave you and me a free and independent America. The history books never told you a lot of what happened in the revolutionary war. We didn't just fight the British. We were British subjects at that time and we fought our own government! Perhaps you can now see why our founding fathers had a hatred for standing armies, and allowed through the second amendment for everyone to be armed.\n\nFrankly, I can't read this without crying. Some of us take these liberties so much for granted. We shouldn't.\"\n\nThe refutation of this is listed on truthorfiction.com. Snopes doesn't outright refute it, but they do mention the falsehoods in the email. \n\nhttp://www.truthorfiction.com/rumors/p/patriots.htm#.VLx1vdq9KK0\nhttp://www.snopes.com/history/american/pricepaid.asp\n\nHere is the content from the Snopes article\n\n\"Five signers were captured by the British as traitors and tortured before they died.\"\n\nIt is true that five signers of the Declaration of Independence were captured by the British during the course of the Revolutionary War. However, none of them died while a prisoner, and four of them were taken into custody not because they were considered \"traitors\" due to their status as signatories to that document, but because they were captured as prisoners of war while actively engaged in military operations against the British. \n\nGeorge Walton was captured after being wounded while commanding militia at the Battle of Savannah in December 1778, and Thomas Heyward, Jr., Arthur Middleton, and Edward Rutledge (three of the four Declaration of Independence signers from South Carolina) were taken prisoner at the Siege of Charleston in May in 1780. Although they endured the ill treatment typically afforded to prisoners of war during their captivity (prison conditions were quite deplorable at the time), they were not tortured, nor is there evidence that they were treated more harshly than other wartime prisoners who were not also signatories to the Declaration. Moreover, all four men were eventually exchanged or released; had they been considered traitors by the British, they would have been hanged. \n\nRichard Stockton of New Jersey was the only signer taken prisoner specifically because of his status as a signatory to the Declaration, \"dragged from his bed by night\" by local Tories after he had evacuated his family from New Jersey, and imprisoned in New York City's infamous Provost Jail like a common criminal. \n\n\"Twelve had their homes ransacked and burned.\"\n\nIt is true that a number of signers saw their homes and property occupied, ransacked, looted, and vandalized by the British (and even in some cases by the Americans). However, as we discuss in more detail below, this activity was a common part of warfare. Signers' homes were not specifically targeted for destruction — like many other Americans, their property was subject to seizure when it fell along the path of a war being waged on the North American continent. \n\n\"Two lost their sons serving in the Revolutionary Army, another had two sons captured.\"\n\nAbraham Clark of New Jersey saw two of his sons captured by the British and incarcerated on the prison ship Jersey. John Witherspoon, also of New Jersey, saw his eldest son, James, killed in the Battle of Germantown in October 1777. If there was a second signer of the Declaration whose son was killed while serving in the Continental Army, we have yet to identify him. \n\n\"Nine of the 56 fought and died from wounds or hardships of the Revolutionary War.\"\n\nThis statement is quite misleading as phrased. Nine signers died during the course of the Revolutionary War, but none of them died from wounds or hardships inflicted on them by the British. (Indeed, several of the nine didn't even take part in the war.) Only one signer, Button Gwinnett of Georgia, died from wounds, and those were received not at the hands of the British, but from a fellow officer with whom he duelled in May 1777. \n\n\"Carter Braxton of Virginia, a wealthy planter and trader, saw his ships swept from the seas by the British Navy. He sold his home and properties to pay his debts, and died in rags.\"\n\nBefore the American Revolution, Carter Braxton was possessed of a considerable fortune through inheritance and favorable marriages. While still in his teens he inherited the family estate, which included a flourishing Virginia tobacco plantation, upon the death of his father. He married a wealthy heiress who died when he was just 21, and within a few years he had remarried, this time to the daughter of the Receiver of Customs in Virginia for the King. As a delegate representing Virginia in the Continental Congress in 1776, he was one of the minority of delegates reluctant to support an American declaration of independence, a move which he viewed at the time as too dangerous:\n[Independence] is in truth a delusive Bait which men inconsiderably catch at, without knowing the hook to which it is affixed ... America is too defenceless a State for the declaration, having no alliance with a naval Power nor as yet any Fleet of consequence of her own to protect that trade which is so essential to the prosecution of the War, without which I know we cannot go on much longer.\nBraxton invested his wealth in commercial enterprises, particularly shipping, and he endured severe financial reversals during the Revolutionary War when many of the ships in which he held interest were either appropriated by the British government (because they were British-flagged) or were sunk or captured by the British. He was not personally targeted for ruin because he had signed the Declaration of Independence, however; he suffered grievous financial losses because most of his wealth was tied up in shipping, \"that trade which is so essential to the prosecution of the War\" and which was therefore a prime military target for the British. Even if he hadn't signed the Declaration of Independence, Braxton's ships would have been casualties of the war just the same. \n\nAlthough Braxton did lose property during the war and had to sell off assets (primarily landholdings) to cover the debts incurred by the loss of his ships, he recouped much of that money after the war but subsequently lost it again through his own ill-advised business dealings. His fortune was considerably diminished in his later years, but he did not by any stretch of the imagination \"die in rags.\" \n\n\"Thomas McKeam was so hounded by the British that he was forced to move his family almost constantly. He served in the Congress without pay, and his family was kept in hiding. His possessions were taken from him, and poverty was his reward.\"\n\nAs one biography describes Thomas McKean (not \"McKeam\"):\nThomas McKean might just represent an ideal study of how far political engagement can be carried by one man. One can scarcely believe the number of concurrent offices and duties this man performed during the course of his long career. He served three states and many more cities and county governments, often performing duties in two or more jurisdictions, even while engaged in federal office.\nAmong his many offices, McKean was a delegate to the Continental Congress (of which he later served as president), President of Delaware, Chief Justice of Pennsylvania, and Governor of Pennsylvania. The above-quoted statement regarding his being \"hounded\" by the British during the Revolutionary War is probably based upon a letter he wrote to his friend John Adams in 1777, in which he described how he had been \"hunted like a fox by the enemy, compelled to remove my family five times in three months, and at last fixed them in a little log-house on the banks of the Susquehanna, but they were soon obliged to move again on account of the incursions of the Indians.\" \n\nHowever, it is problematic to assert that McKean's treatment was due to his being a signer of the Declaration of Independence. (His name does not appear on printed copies of that document authenticated in January 1777, so it is likely he did not affix his name to it until later.) If he was targeted by the British, it was quite possibly because he also served in a military capacity as a volunteer leader of militia. In any case, McKean did not end up in \"poverty,\" as the estate he left behind when he died in 1817 was described as consisting of \"stocks, bonds, and huge land tracts in Pennsylvania.\" \n\n\"Vandals or soldiers looted the properties of Dillery, Hall, Clymer, Walton, Gwinnett, Heyward, Ruttledge, and Middleton.\"\n\nFirst of all, this passage has a couple of misspellings: the signers referred to are William Ellery (not \"Dillery\") and Edward Rutledge (not \"Ruttledge\"). Secondly, this sentence is misleading in that it implies a motive that was most likely not present (i.e., these men's homes were looted because they had been signers of the Declaration of Independence). \n\nThe need to forage for supplies in enemy territory has long been a part of warfare, and so it was far from uncommon for British soldiers in the field to appropriate such material from private residences during the American Revolution. (Not only were homes used as sources of food, livestock, and other necessary supplies, but larger houses were also taken over and used to quarter soldiers or to serve as headquarters for officers.) In some cases, even American forces took advantage of the local citizenry to provision themselves. Given that many more prominent American revolutionaries who were also signers of the Declaration of Independence (e.g., Samuel Adams, John Hancock, Benjamin Franklin, James Wilson, Benjamin Rush, Robert Morris) had homes in areas that were occupied by the British during the war, yet those homes were not looted or vandalized, it's hard to make the case that the men named above were specifically targeted for vengeance by the British rather than unfortunate victims whose property fell in the path of an armed conflict being waged on American soil. \n\n\"At the battle of Yorktown, Thomas Nelson, Jr., noted that the British General Cornwallis had taken over the Nelson home for his headquarters. He quietly urged General George Washington to open fire. The home was destroyed, and Nelson died bankrupt.\"\n\nThe tale about Thomas Nelson's urging or suggesting the bombardment of his own house is one of several Revolutionary War legends whose truth may never be known. Several versions of this story exist, one of which (as referenced above) holds that Nelson encouraged George Washington to shell his Yorktown home after British Major General Charles Cornwallis had taken it over to use as his headquarters in 1781:\nCornwallis had turned the home of Thomas Nelson, who had succeeded Jefferson as governor of Virginia, into his headquarters. Nelson, a signer of the Declaration of Independence, had led three Virginia brigades, or 3,000 men, to Yorktown and, when the shelling of the town was about to begin, urged Washington to bombard his own house. And that is where Washington, with his experienced surveyor's eye, reputedly pointed the gun for the first (and singularly fatal) allied shot. Legend has it that the shell went right through a window and landed at the dinner table where some British officers, including the British commissary general, had just sat down to dine. The general was killed and several others wounded as it burst among their plates.\nOther versions of the story have Nelson directing the Marquis de Lafayette to train French artillery on his home:\nThe story goes that the new Virginia Governor Thomas Nelson (who'd been held at Yorktown but released under a flag of truce) was with American forces that day. Lafayette invited Nelson to be present when Captain Thomas Machin's battery first opened fire, as both a compliment and knowing Nelson lived in Yorktown and would know the localities in the riverport area. \"To what particular spot,\" Lafayette reportedly asked Nelson, \"would your Excellency direct that we should point the cannon.\" Nelson replied, \"There, to that house. It is mine, and ... it is the best one in the town. There you will be almost certain to find Lord Cornwallis and the British headquarters.\" \n\n\"A simultaneous discharge of all the guns in the line,\" Joseph Martin wrote, was \"followed [by] French troops accompanying it with 'Huzza for the Americans.'\" Sounding much like the Nelson legend, Martin's account added that \"the first shell sent from our batteries entered an elegant house formerly owned or occupied by the Secretary of State under the British, and burned directly over a table surrounded by a large party of British officers at dinner, killing and wounding a number of them.\"\nStill other accounts maintain this legend is a conflation of two separate events: Thomas Nelson, acting as commander in chief of the Virginia militia, ordered a battery to open fire on his uncle's home, where Cornwallis was then ensconced. Later, Nelson supposedly made a friendly bet with French artillerists in which he challenged them to hit his home, one of the more prominent landmarks in Yorktown. \n\nWhatever the truth, the Nelson home was certainly not \"destroyed\" as claimed. The house stands to this day as part of Colonial National Historical Park, and the National Park Service's description of it notes only that \"the southeast face of the residence does show evidence of damage from cannon fire.\" \n\n\"Francis Lewis had his home and properties destroyed. The enemy jailed his wife, and she died within a few months.\"\n\nFrancis Lewis represented New York in the Continental Congress, and shortly after he signed the Declaration of Independence his Long Island estate was raided by the British, possibily as retaliation for his having been a signatory to that document. While Lewis was in Philadelphia attending to congressional matters, his wife was taken prisoner by the British after disregarding an order for citizens to evacuate Long Island. Mrs. Lewis was held for several months before being exchanged for the wives of British officials captured by the Americans. Although her captivity was undoubtedly a hardship, she had already been in poor health for some time and died a few years (not months) later. \n\nJohn Hart was driven from his wife's bedside as she was dying. Their 13 children fled for their lives. His fields and his gristmill were laid to waste. For more than a year, he lived in forests and caves, returning home to find his wife dead and his children vanished. A few weeks later, he died from exhaustion and a broken heart.\n\nJohn Hart's New Jersey farm was looted in the course of the Revolutionary War (possibly due his status as Speaker of the Assembly), and he did have to remain in hiding in nearby mountains for a short time, but the rest of the above passage is gross exaggeration. When the British overran the area of New Jersey where Hart resided in late November of 1776, he was not \"driven from his [dying] wife's bedside,\" as his wife had already died several weeks earlier (and most of his thirteen children were adults by then). He certainly didn't spend \"more than a year\" on the run living \"in forests and caves,\" as the Continental Army recaptured the area within a month (through General George Washington's famous crossing of the Delaware River on Christmas night). Hart also did not die \"from exhaustion and a broken heart\" a mere \"few weeks\" after emerging from hiding — in 1778 he was re-elected to the New Jersey assembly, and he invited the American army to encamp on his New Jersey farmland in June 1778 before succumbing to kidney stones in May 1779. \n\n\"Norris and Livingston suffered similar fates.\"\n\nLewis Morris (not Norris) indeed saw his Westchester County, New York, home taken over in 1776 and used as a barracks for soldiers, and the horses and livestock from his farm commandeered by military personnel, but he suffered those initial deprivations at the hands of the Continental Army, not the British. Shortly afterwards his property was appropriated, looted, and burned by the British when they occupied New York. (Morris and his wife were eventually able to reclaim their property and restore their home after the war.) \n\nPhilip Livingston lost several properties to the British occupation of New York and sold off others to support the war effort, and he did not recover them because he died suddenly in 1778, before the end of the war. \n\n\n\n\nThis kind of bad history is something I'd expect to see in \"America: imagine the world without her.\" The patriotic lies in this stand as an example of the American Exceptionalism idea. I'm not surprised my dad said something like this, given that he followed it up by saying \" Yeah this country used to be great, but Obama has destroyed it.\" \n\nSo, how'd I do? Anything I need to fix? \n\n\n\n\n",

The above link from cracked exemplifies both of these qualities. \n\n&gt;Picture this: You're an archaeologist minding your own business in New Mexico when a guy comes up and tells you he's got something to show you. Once you check to make sure he's wearing pants and double check to make sure you've got a gun, you follow him to this town outside Albuquerque called Los Lunas. And there he shows you a 90-ton rock inscribed with ancient writing. No big deal, right? Everyone knows Native Americans have lived in the area since at least the 1850s, it's only natural they'd scratch some graffiti up every now and then. People get bored.\nThis is exactly what happened to archaeology professor Frank Hibben in 1933. Only he had the sense to recognize that the scribbling wasn't Native American writing -- it was Hebrew. Ancient Hebrew. And the message wasn't \"Custer sux balls,\" it was the Ten Commandments.\n\nR5: From [wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Lunas_Decalogue_Stone#cite_ref-4).\n\nThe first counter argument is that the punctuation is of a much more modern form than would be in any pre-columbian hebrew. Additionally there is quite poor grammar and stylistic errors in the text, which given the importance of the ten commandments is very questionable.\n\nThe second counter argument is the condition of the stone. The clarity of the inscriptions throws doubt upon the age of the stone as well as the inability to conduct effective dating of the carvings. The only techniques used were shown to be unreliable. This indicates that the stone is likely to be much more recent and likely forged. The archaeologist who found the stone also likely committed fraud in separate incidents.\n\nThe third and most convincing counter argument from wiki: \n&gt;His main concern however is the lack of any archaeological context. He argues that to get to the location of the stone would have required whoever inscribed it to have \"stopped along the way. encamped, eaten food, broken things, disposed of trash, performed rituals, and so on. And those actions should have left a trail of physical archaeological evidence across the greater American Southwest, discovery of which would undeniably prove the existence of foreigners in New Mexico in antiquity with a demonstrably ancient Hebrew material culture...\" and states that \"There are no pre-Columbian ancient Hebrew settlements, no sites containing the everyday detritus of a band of ancient Hebrews, nothing that even a cursory knowledge of how the archaeological record forms would demand there would be. From an archaeological standpoint, that's plainly impossible.\"\n\nWith all of these issues, this appears to be yet another hoax of a pre-columbian artifact in North America.",

Thanks Mr Gibbon.\n\n\n\"She came to embody the enlightened Alexandian (sic) spirit\"\n\n\nReally? The main thing she embodied was Neo-Platonism - a kind of semi-mystical monotheism that included celibacy, belief in one deity and an idea that its Godhood permeated the universe. She may or may not have also been a Christian, though she certainly had Christians amongst her followers and students because her philosophy so closely fitted with theirs. Funny how these \"TIL\"s never mention that.\n\n\n\"She was flayed to death with oyster shells by a Christian mob\"\n\n\nWell, she was assassinated by a mob of supporters of one political faction (who happened to follow a Christian leader) because she was the supporter of another political faction (which also followed a Christian leader) because her (Christian) leader had done the same to one of their guys. But I guess actually knowing the history and realising it had zero to do with religion or her learning is no fun. So \"TIL\" we can just make crap up to invent a better story.\n\n\nAnd no, she wasn't \"flayed to death with oyster shells\" - that was Edward Gibbon's lurid invention. She was stoned to death with roof tiles. Not that this makes much difference since \"TIL\" historical accuracy doesn't matter.\n\n\n\"Her death is considered by many to be the beginning of the end for intellectual Alexandria\"\n\n\nBy \"many\"? Yes, by \"many\" who don't actually have a clue who about history. Those who do have a clue (ummm, historians) know this is total crap. The \"beginining of the end\"? How? That would have been news to Aedisia, who was a female pagan philosopher working in Alexandria a generation after Hypatia and who, strangely, remained unmolested by wicked Christian mobs (though she did stay out of Alexandria's vicious civic politics - spot the difference). It would also have been news to Hierocles, Asclepius of Tralles, Olympiodorus the Younger, Ammonius Hermiae or Hermias; all renowned scholars who worked in the city after Hypatia. But hey - let's not let actual history get in the way of our \"TIL\".\n\n\nHow about \"TIL\" that I need to check my facts and \"TIL\" that not every piece of hysterical nonsense I find on the internet is correct. Give that a try.\n\n",

They no long had to follow herds of animals around to hunt their food. A surplus of food allowed them to settle, forming early civilizations such as Mesopotamia and The Indus River Valley.

There had to be everything they could need at any season, and no want that would tempt them to wander further. This was a possible state of affairs, no doubt, in many European and Asiatic valleys; and in many such valleys, as in the case of the Swiss lake dwellings, men settled from a very early date indeed; but nowhere, of any countries now known to us, were these favourable conditions found upon such a scale, and nowhere did they hold good so surely year in and year out as in Egypt and in the country between the upper waters of the Euphrates and Tigris and the\nPersian Gulf.[1] Here was a constant water supply under enduring sunlight; trustworthy harvests year by year; in Mesopotamia wheat yielded, says Herodotus, two hundredfold to the sower; Pliny says that it was cut twice and afterwards yielded good fodder for sheep; there were abundant palms and many sorts of fruits; and as for building material, in Egypt there was clay and easily worked stone, and in Mesopotamia a clay that becomes a brick in the sunshine.\"",

        "text": "First post!\n\nPearl Habor was a huge blunder for America. So much failure on reconnaisance, not taking radar seriously, bad logistics (ammo for flak was locked up) and underestimation of Japanese abilities and range of their airplanes.\n\nHollywood decided it needs a Michael Bay movie and the results are so aweful I cringed really hard when watching it. The historical inaccuracies are so much, they are hard to write down. Just a short overview:\n\n* A6M Zeros with Torpedos! The A6M \"Zero\" was a fighter plane that was used in the attack. They weren't able to carry a Type 91 Torpedo (the best they could do was carrying 2 60 kg bombs at the cost at range) and were supposed to strave aircrafts on runways and fly top cover. Their camo is wrong and version is wrong. They used the A6M3 rather than the A6M2 Type 21 with a green light camo.\n\n* B5N Kate! The B5N is shown bombing from little height. The bombs depicted are wrong. They were modified AP battleship shells to be used as bombs and had to be dropped from 3000m. Also a back gunner wouldn't be able to traverse his gun like that and strave poor Americans while looking like the evil Jap he is.\n\n* The bullshit childhood scene showing a plane in the 1923 that was introduced in 1932 doing crop dusting, something which was only started 1924\n\n* The P40 \"Tomahawk\" the American heros with their magnum dongs used are completely wrong. They show the \"Kittyhawk\" P40-E. Differences are pretty big. The Tomahawk had two nose mounted .50 cal and two .30 cals in the wings while the Kittyhawk has 6 .50 cals in the wings.\n\n* The fighter scenes are wrong. No, they didn't dog fight at dangerous low altitude but took down Aichi D3A \"Val bombers\". Also at first they only had ammo for the 30. cal and had to rearm. Kenneth Taylor is spinning in his grave because of his movie (he said befor how aweful it is) and George Welch would be spinning in his grave if he would know that this movie exists. The story of these two guys is awesome in itself. I have no idea why Michael Bay felt that this wasn't epic enough.\n\n* Doolittle raid! It's appaling how they make no big deal how a fighter pilot randomly switches over to flying a bomber. But the two heros with their magnum dongs had to do everything heroic. In reality they didn't crash land their planes (dangerous thing to do, huh). They parachuted out them. And noone saved another crew from the japanese by straving them before crashing into the ground. \n\nI could ramble on and on and on. It's just so frustating to see this piece of shit of an excuse for a war movie that basicially is just a commercial for enlistment into the army.\n\nTypical Michael Bay so to say.\n\nWatch Tora! Tora! Tora! for a better Pearl Habor or Midway for a better war movie showing the pacific theatre.\n\n[The wikipedia article of this movie gives you a good overview of the inaccuracies, but they too skim the top.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearl_Harbor_%28film%29#Historical_accuracy) But that's okay. This movie doesn't deserve aything deep.\n\nThanks for reading!\n",

        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2sg2tf/this_is_literally_the_worst_thing_i_have_ever/",
        "text": "First, this topic is very obscure. Do not trust Wikipedia on this. Just...do not. \n\nIntroduction to Joseon political factions: In the late 16th century, political factions (*Bungdang*) arose in the court of the Joseon Dynasty of Korea. These factions originally centered around certain officials, philosophers, and neo-Confucian schools and ideologies, and often clashed bloodily.\n\nFor example, here's the simplified life of one faction:\n\n1. Splits into two from older faction because of disagreement on who should take a certain government position\n\n2. Fights bloodily with other faction\n\n3. When other faction is defeated, splits into two on how harshly the defeated faction should be punished\n\nFor the purposes of this thread, I thought that was all that people really needed to know. If you disagree, just ask (except that I need to sleep soon...so probably tomorrow is better).\n\n[This](http://i.imgur.com/7KUPNcX.png) is a very **simplified** chart of Joseon factions I made today. It's not as accurate as I would like, but for our purposes, it's sufficient. \n\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n[The offending article](https://kmlabean.wordpress.com/2012/05/01/term-paper-first-draft-prince-sado사도세자-why-was-he-killed-by-his-father/). There are grammatical errors throughout the thing, but whatever. I'm too lazy to put [*sic*]s all over the place.\n\nI really would have liked to do a R5 of the whole thing, but I am far too tired. So just the \"King Youngjo, who was he?\" section.\n\nFirst, a **very long, but still very simplified,** timeline of important political events in Korea, from 1659 to 1724. I intentionally omitted Yeongjo era politics (1724-1776) in the timeline because the person who wrote this piece of /r/badhistory doesn't discuss it much.\n\n* 1659: King Hyojong dies. The dispute known as the Gihae Yesong begins. The issue stems from the fact that while Hyojong was the second  son of his father, Injo, he inherited the throne as if he were the eldest son. So should Queen Jaui, Hyojong's stepmother, wear a funeral robe for three years (parents wore a funeral robe for three years if their eldest son died) or for only one year (parents wore a funeral robe for only one year if a younger son died)? The initial position of the Seoin (西人, *Westerners*), the dominant faction in court, is that since the *Daming Lu*, a Ming Dynasty law code, says that parents had to wear a funeral robe for only one year when any son, be it the oldest or the youngest, died, Queen Jaui is only required to wear the funeral robe for one year. \n\n* 1660: Ten months later, Heo Mok, a Namin (南人, *Southerners*), quotes from *Etiquette and Ceremonial* (儀禮, *Yili*), a Chinese Confucian text, to support the argument that what matters is that Hyojong inherited the royal lineage, not that he had an older brother. He also argues that *Etiquette and Ceremonial* says that when a king dies, the mourners are to wear a mourning robe for three years.\n\n* Still 1660: Song Si-yeol, the leading scholar of the Seoin faction, responds exactly thirty days later, saying that although *Etiquette and Ceremonial* did say that the lineage was what mattered, it only applies in cases where the first son died in childhood, and therefore does not apply in Hyojong's case (Hyojong's elder brother died when he was 33). He then points out that *Etiquette and Ceremonial* says that a three-year funeral robe should not be worn if the person who inherits the lineage was *Seoja* (*Shuzi* in Chinese, 庶子 in Chinese characters). *Seoja* generally refers to children of concubines, but Song somehow manages to find another Confucian text that said that *Seoja* could also refer to any son who is not the oldest. He says that Heo's argument that since Hyojong was a king, Queen Jaui and all other mourners had to wear a funeral robe for three years is ridiculous, since Queen Jaui is not Hyojong's subject (because Queen Jaui was already a queen when Hyojong was only a prince).\n\n* Still 1660: Yun Seon-do, a leading Namin, says that the *Seoja* argument is irrelevant, since Confucian texts explicitly say that if a younger son inherits the line a three-year funeral robe is to be worn. He then points out that according to Song Si-yeol, even if a younger son becomes king and inherits the lineage, if he has an older brother who died in adulthood, he will be merely \"a false prince\" and \"a regent,\" meaning that the descendants of a younger brother can never be king over the descendants of the older brother (descendants of Hyojong's elder brother are still alive, so Yun is indirectly accusing Song of treason). He then says that the fact that Queen Jaui is not a subject of Hyojong is irrelevant as well, since fathers wear three-year funeral robes for their children as well. He then argues that since Queen Jaui wore a three-year funeral robe for the death of Hyojong's elder brother, it is illogical that the queen should wear only a one-year robe for the king while wearing a three-year robe for the prince. \n\n* Still 1660: Yun Seon-do is exiled to the far north. His response is burned. Gihae Yesong ends, with the Seoin victorious. \n\n* 1674: Hyojong's wife, Queen Inseon, dies. Gabin Yesong begins. Queen Jaui, who is still alive, must wear a funeral robe again. She is to wear the robe for nine months, in accordance with the claim that Hyojong is a *Seoja*. A Namin-affiliated man argues that the *Daming Lu* decrees that the funeral robe for deceased daughters-in-laws has to be worn for a full year. The king, Hyeonjong, uses this argument to exile Kim Su-hong, the Seoin *Yeonguijeong* (a yeonguijeong is rather like a prime minister). The Namin minister Heo Jeok is named *Yeonguijeong*. Hyeonjong dies a month later.\n\n* 1674-1675: The new king, Sukjong, quickly expels or exiles many key Seoin, including Song Si-yeol. The Namin become the dominant faction in court.\n\n* 1675-1680: Namin rule. The Namin are *finally* the dominant faction after a century.\n\n* 1680:The Gyeongsin Hwanguk:  Most Namin are stripped of their titles and/or exiled, and are all replaced by Seoin. Three of some of the most important Namin ministers (Heo Jeok, Yun Hyu, Yu Hyeok-yeon) are executed.\n\n* 1683: Kim Ik-hun and Kim Seok-ju, two Seoin ministers, plot to completely crush the Namin (Kim Seok-ju was largely responsible for the Gyeongsin Hwanguk, and feared Namin reprisals). They convince Kim Hwan, a cousin of a Namin official, to expose some sort of Namin conspiracy. A very minor Namin named Heo Sae tells Kim Hwan that there is a huge conspiracy of Namin to dethrone the king. Kim secretly puts gunpowder in Heo's house and reveals the conspiracy. Unfortunately for the Seoin, the only person who is actually involved is Heo Sae himself.\n\n* Still 1683: The Seoin decide to take out Yu Myeong-gyeon, another leading Namin official. They learn that Yu often visits Jeon Ik-dae, and Kim Hwan threatens to kill Jeon if he does not confess that the non-existent conspiracy of Namin exists. However, in the investigation, Jeon confesses the wrong thing; he confesses that Kim Hwan threatened to kill him. This confession leads to a large number of younger Seoin openly attacking Kim Seok-ju, Kim Ik-hun, and Kim Hwan.\n\n* Still 1683: Song Si-yeol defends Kim Ik-hun. The Seoin splits into two; the Noron (老論, \"Reasoning of the Old\") who support Song, and the Soron (少論, \"Reasoning of the Young\") who are opposed to Song.\n\n* 1680s: Yun Jeung is widely considered the best student of Song Si-yeol. When Yun Jeung's father dies, Yun asks his teacher to write an obituary. Song disliked the fact that Yun's father was close to the Namin, so he intentionally writes a poorly written obituary. He repeatedly refuses to write a good obituary, while many of those close to Song begin to accuse Yun Jeung's father of cowardice (when the Manchus captured Ganghwa Island, his wife and two of his closest friends committed suicide, but Yun Jeung's father did not). Yun Jeung, infuriated, writes a letter accusing Song of various misdeeds. In the end, Yun chooses not to send the letter, but Song has already acquired the letter, and responds. Yun responds as well. This series of letters continues until Song finally ends the relationship. The Noron naturally sides with Song, and the Soron with Yun.\n\n* 1688: Jang Huibin, beloved concubine of Sukjong, gives birth to a son. Jang Huibin's father is a rich merchant affiliated with the Namin.\n\n* 1689: Jang's son is named heir apparent. Song Si-yeol criticizes this decision. Sukjong is infuriated and replaces most Seoin with Namin. Song Si-yeol is exiled, and Kim Su-hang, one of his favorite students, is executed. Kim Ik-hun is tortured to death. Kim Hwan is beheaded. Kim Seok-ju, who is already dead, is also punished. This event is called the Gisa Hwanguk.\n\n* Still 1689: Jang Huibin becomes queen. Queen Inmok is deposed.\n\n* Still 1689: Song Si-yeol is executed.\n\n* 1693: A woman with the surname Choi officially becomes a concubine of the king.\n\n* 1694: Gapsul Hwanguk: The Namin detect a conspiracy and force one of the conspirators to confess. This results in another bloody investigation. At around the same time, three other people confess that the Namin ministers, *who were in power at the time*, were plotting treason and attempting to assassinate Choi (the aforementioned concubine). Sukjong uses this situation to sack Namin en masse and brings back the Noron and Soron.\n\n* Still 1694: Restoration of Queen Inhyeon.\n\n* Still 1694: Birth of Prince Yeonying (=Yeongjo)\n\n* 1696: A failed attempt to restore Namin government. Jang Huibin is involved, and the Soron ministers, who are defensive of the young Crown Prince, fail to deflect attention from the Jang family.\n\n* 1696-1701: During these five years, Jang Huibin used shamanistic rituals to try and kill the queen.\n\n* 1701: Death of the queen. RIP. Subsequently, Jang is executed. RIP.\n\n* Still 1701: Nam Gu-man, an influential Soron minister, is sacked. \n\n* 1703: Park Se-bo, a Soron scholar, is attacked by Noron. Park had formerly insulted Song Si-yeol and called him an \"Owl\" in an obituary. Park is sacked and the offending books and obituary are burned.\n\n* 1710: Choi Seok-jeong, another influencial Soron minister, is sacked for not caring enough about the king's illnesses. Choi's commentaries on Confucian texts are burned. \n\n* 1716: The king orders the obituary Song Si-yeol had written for Yun Jeung's father, and the letter Yun Jeung had chosen not to send to Song Si-yeol (remember, Song acquired it through other people), to be brought to him. He decides that Song had not insulted Yun's father, while Yun had insulted Song. Soron are sacked, exiled, or allowed to resign.\n\n* 1717: Yi Ui-Myeong, a powerful Noron official, has a meeting with Sukjong. No one else is present. \n\n* Still 1717: The Crown Prince (who is, let's remember, the son of Jang Hui-bin) becomes regent only six days after the secret meeting. Noron support this decision; Soron, distrusting this sudden Noron support for the Crown Prince, do not.\n\n* 1717-1720: The Crown Prince is regent. Nothing happens.\n\n* 1720: Sukjong dies.\n\n* Still 1720: The Crown Prince becomes king (from now on, I will call him Gyeongjong, which is the temple name, or alternately, the king).\n\n* 1721: The Noron decide to make Prince Yeonying, their favored royal family member, the Crown Prince. They pretty much force the king to make his brother the Crown Prince, The same year, the Noron try to get their prince to rule in the king's name. The plan is foiled by Choi Seok-hang, a Soron minister. Three days later, the king himself suddenly decrees that the prince should be regent. Initially, the Noron and the Soron both oppose (the Noron oppose in a rahter nominal way), until the Noron are finally deceived into thinking that the king actually wants a regency. Turns out he does not. \n\n* 1721: Noron are ousted from power following the accusations of various Soron and Namin ministers, led by Kim Il-gyeong. Kim Il-gyeong is *Jullon*; an extremist, basically.\n\n* 1722: Mok Ho-ryong claims that people connected to major Noron figures tried to kill or remove Gyeongjong with assassins, by poisoning, or by faking a document. This leads to a great purge of Noron, and many influential Norons are killed. RIP.\n\n* 1724: Gyeongjong dies, and Yeongjo's reign begins as Prince Yeonying takes the throne. He executes Mok Ho-ryong and Kim Il-gyeong less than four months after his coronation. Technically, Mok was not executed-he died of torture. End of our timeline.\n\nImmediately, we begin to see some huge holes in this person's narrative.\n\n&gt; The story began from the 19th king of Joseon Dynasty, King Sukjong, the father of King Youngjo. His era was bloody like that of Queen Merry of England because he tried to strengthen the absolute authority of the king by making his retainers fought each other, never gave them a chance to ally and prevented them to challenge to the king’s power.\n\nThis is an oversimplification of Sukjong-era politics, but it's not blatantly inaccurate.\n\n&gt; In the years of Sukjong’s reign, the Noron(which means, Old Learning) faction led by Song Siyeol, and Soron(New Learning) faction, led by Yoon Jeung clashed over the proclaim [*sic*] of queen constantly and bloodily.\n\nWhat???\n\nFirst, the Noron and the Soron **did not fight over who the rightful queen was.** Jang Huibin and Queen Inhyeon, the two queens of the 1680s and 1690s, were supported respectively by the Namin and the Seoin (Noron + Soron, even after the schism). This person obviously thinks that the Namin are the Soron, which is really, really sad. Thinking Namin = Soron is like thinking United Kingdom = United States of America.\n\nSecond, the feuds between who the queen should be were not \"constant\" throughout the Sukjong era, although they certainly were \"bloody.\" The deposition of Queen Inmok was first suggested around April 23, 1689, by the king himself, and attempts to restore Jang Hui Bin ended when she was executed in October 1701, so only twelve years. Sukjong ruled for 46 years.\n\n&gt; In the very early era, Noron was in power because they won the Royal Funeral Dispute against Soron. After nin years however, the Noron collapsed when Sukjong deposed Queen Inhyeon, who was supported by the Noron faction, and named Consort Huibin (also called Consort Jang or Jang Hui-bin) as the new queen. \n\nAgain, this guy confuses the Namin with the Soron.\n\nSecond, something is wrong with this person's timeline of events. S/he seems to be thinking that what happened was like [this](http://i.imgur.com/B5K5q72.png) when what actually happened was actually a bit more like [this](http://i.imgur.com/0E3dHqg.png).\n\n&gt; She is widely thought to be one of the most beautiful women in Joseon Dynasty, and her beauty was even mentioned in the Annals. The Noron faction angered Sukjong when it opposed the naming of Consort Huibin’s son as a crown prince. The Soron faction, who supported Consort Huibin and her son, regained power and drove out Noron faction, executing Song Siyeol in revenge. This is called Gisa hwangguk.(Hwangguk means the number one party changed)(Lee,138) \n\nAll correct, if simplified, except that this person is *still* thinking the Namin and the Soron are the same thing.\n\n&gt; Five years later in 1694, the Soron faction was planning another purge of the Noron faction, accusing them of conspiracy to reinstate the deposed Queen Inhyeon, when Sukjong began to regret deposing Queen Inhyeon and favor Consort Sukbin who was an ally of Queen Inhyeon and the Noron faction.\n\nSukjong began to favor Choi, who was a female servant of the king, by April 1693, when she was named *Sukwon* (concubine). That's at least eight months before 1694 even begins. \n\nStill thinking Soron = Namin. WTF.\n\n&gt; Angry with the Soron faction’s attempt to purge Norons, Sukjong abruptly turned around to purge Soron and brought the Noron faction back in power.\n\nThe main cause of the Gapsul Hwanguk was more about Sukjong's changing love interests than his (possibly/probably nonexistent) anger with the ~~Soron~~ Namin purge.\n\n&gt;  The Soron faction would never recover from this blow, also called Gapsul hwanguk.\n\nFirst, the Soron *profited* from the Gapsul Hwanguk.\n\nSecond, even if this person meant to say *Namin*, it's still wrong. The Namin were revived in the Jeongjo (1776-1800) era, under the leadership of Chae Je-gong, partly to weaken the dominance of the Noron Byeokpa faction. So they clearly did recover from this blow.\n\n&gt; Sukjong demoted Queen Jang(who had been Consort Huibin) to Consort Huibin and reinstated Queen Inhyeon. Consort Huibin was eventually executed for cursing Queen Inhyeon after the queen died.\n\nAll true.\n\n&gt;  The Soron faction supported the crown prince, Consort Jang’s son, while the Noron faction, holding a dominant power supported Consort Sukbin’s son, Yeonying-gun (later to become Yeongjo).\n\nTrue. The Soron did in fact protect Jang's son; he's finally stopped confusing the Namin with the Soron. However, I'd remind him that the Noron were not fully dominant until around 1716.\n\n&gt;  In 1720, Sukjong allowed the crown prince, the son of Consort Huibin soon to be Gyeongjong of Joseon, to rule the country as a king and died. \n\nHe did not \"allow\" the prince to do anything. He just died before he could replace the Crown Prince position with Prince Yeonying.\n\n&gt; However, as the bedrock of his party, Soron was weak, his position was extremely unstable either. It is proved that he was pushed by Noron into appointing his younger brother, Yeonying-gun (the son of Consort Sukbin who later became King Yoengjo) as an heir to the throne \n\nThis is true.\n\n&gt; and allow him to act as regent.\n\n*The whole point of politics in the Gyongjong era is that Prince Yeonying failed to be regent.*\n\nAs this person said immediately before, the Noron successfully made Prince Yeonying Crown Prince (August 20, 1721). The Noron then suggested that Prince Yeonying should serve as a regent (October 10, 1721). The same day, the Soron minister Choe Seok-hang stopped the regency from occurring.\n\nThree days later, Gyeongjong suddenly declared that as he was ill, Prince Yeonying should indeed serve as regent. This time, even the Noron made efforts to look as if they opposed this decision, but as Gyeongjong continued to claim that he was in favor with the regency, the Noron ended their nominal opposition (October 16, 1721). But the Soron again managed to stop the regency (October 17, 1721).\n\nWith something like this (from the *Annals* entry for October 17, 1721)\n\n&gt; Kim Chang-jib [a leader of the Norons at the time] then said,\n\n&gt; \"Only when you speedily withdraw the orders [saying that the Crown Prince should be Regent] of before shall you be able to calm the hearts of the people.\"\n\n&gt; The King said,\n\n&gt; \"I see.\"\n\n&gt; [...]\n\n&gt; Then Jo Tae-gu [the Soron minister responsible for the withdrawal of the orders] said, \n\n&gt; \"The hearts of the people shall finally be calmed, for you have withdrawn [the orders] following the advice of a minister.\"\n\nhow can you say that Prince Yeonying did serve as regent?\n\n&gt; (The king was only thirty years old at that time which means he was still healthy and there was high possibility that he could get his own son.)\n\nFirst, Gyeongjong was 34, not 30.\n\nSecond, there were a lot of rumors ATT, and even now, that Gyeongjong was infertile. He had no children despite being married to two different women for nearly two decades, and took no concubines.\n\nJust saying.\n\n&gt; Soron immediately and desperately opposed to the idea, one step further they rigged up a conspiracy against Noron; they reported to the king that Noron tried to kill the king and crowned Yeongying-gun as a new king. By this conspiracy, Noron totally swept out from the court and Yeongying-gun recorded as a head of rebel.\n\nRidiculous. This person is confusing two different events, and still making fundamental mistakes.\n\nAs we saw above, the Noron failed to make Prince Yeonying regent. In December 6, 1721, Namin and Soron officials led by Kim Il-gyeong accused the Noron of disrespecting the king. In response, Gyeongjong \"totally swept out the Noron from the court.\" However, the accusations had nothing to do with a conspiracy, and Yeonying was not \"recorded as a traitor.\" Four months later, a Namin named Mok Ho-ryeong claimed that there was a huge conspiracy of Noron to remove or kill Gyeongjong by poisoning, assassins, and/or faked documents. This led to a bloody purge of Noron.\n\nHowever, even WRT Mok Ho-ryong's Noron conspiracy, Yeonying was not \"crown**ed** as a new king.\" The plan was to crown Yeonying *after the death of Gyeongjong.* \"Yeongying-gun recorded as a head of rebel.\" is also incorrect. While he *may* have been a leader of the conspiracy (he later claimed that the members of this conspiracy had contacted him), he was not recorded to be one in any form of governmental records. While these may be English errors, they're still incorrect. \n\n&gt; However since the Queen Mother strongly protected Yeongying-gun he could barely saved his life and position(the successor). It seemed Soron refound their rulling party state, at least just for a couple of years.\n \nTrue. A simplification, but true. \n\n&gt;  However in 1724, King Gyeongjong was bedridden and his life was at a risk. What we should observe carefully is what Yeoning-gun did at that time. He insisted his older brother had to have Crab Marinated in Soy sauce, persimmons and ginseng tea at the same time though the doctors strongly opposed to his suggeston. According to oriental medicine principals, those three take antipathy to each other, so we must not eat them together. If a sick person take three of them all togher, he or she could even die. It was true. the king passed away in few days after his brother made him have those three inspite of the doctor’s teeth.\n\nHe gets everything wrong. What he seems to reference is this (from *Annals* for August 24, 1724, a few **hours** before Gyeongjong's death)\n\n&gt; Yi Gwang-ja [head of the Soron at the time] asked [the king] how he was, and when the king did not answer, the Crown Prince [=Yeongjo] said, weeping,\n\n&gt; \"Quickly, bring ginseng and aconitine.\"\n\n&gt; Yi Gwang-ja gave the king ginseng tea twice. Yi Gong-yun told Yi Gwang-ja,\n\n&gt; \"Do not use too much ginseng tea. If you give [the king] ginseng tea again after I have given my treatments, [the king] shall never recover.\"\n\n&gt; The Crown Prince replied, \n\n&gt; \"Although it is true that there are times when a man must express his opinions, in such a time, how is it that you do not allow the use of ginseng, simply to prove yourself right?\"\n\n&gt; Soon, the king's eyes calmed and his nose warmed again. The Crown Prince said,\n\n&gt; \"I do not know much of the art of medicine, but I know that ginseng and aconitine restore the qi (the actual word used was 陽氣).\"\n\nAnd then the Noron commentator blames Yi Gong-yun for stopping the king's ginseng medication, which is implied to have caused the king's death, Of course, we don't know the truth, but it's not really clear whether the ginseng helped, or harmed, the king. \n\nAnother entry, from August 20, is also relevant\n\n&gt; At night, the king's chest and stomach ached as if they were being twisted. The next day, many physicians said, \"Yesterday, His Majesty ate marinated crabs, then persimmons. Physicians avoid this.\" \n\nNo mention of Crown Princes or ginseng tea anywhere.\n\n\nBack to the /r/badhistory\n\n&gt; A new king’s era opened finally in August 1724. People no more called him Yeonging-gun(‘gun’ refers to the son of king’s concubine while ‘daegun’ was for queen’s sons. As his mother was a Consort not an official queen, he was called Yeonging-gun instead of Yeonging-Daegun.) but King Youngjo which means Noron came back to their power again. Nevertheless the rumor Youngjo killed Gyeongjong rapidly spreaded through the whole nation and few rebellions(the rebellion of Injua Lee in 1728) occurred declaring to revenge for King Gyeongjon. Though the rebellions put down barely, the rumor became his irrevocable complex. Thus, during his reign he shows some over reacted actions involved with the rumor. He regularly tried to abdicate the throne to the prince in order to reveal intentionally he had no greed for a crown. (Always after his retainers dissuaded strongly, he stealthily withdrew his order.) He also often dropped tears and emphasized how his older brother loved him much. \n\nI mean, this is all true, but why won't this guy mention Yeongjo's policies designed to reduce the conflict between the various factions? \n\nWhy isn't this person mentioning the time he sacked *Noron* ministers and brought back a Soron government so that he could reduce the feuding (July 1727)?\n\nWhy isn't this person mentioning the fact that Yi In-jwa's rebellion was suppressed by *Soron* ministers and *Soron* generals?\n\nWhy isn't this person mentioning the times Yeongjo made Yi Gwang-ja  (the leader of the Sorons in the Yeongjo era) and various Noron ministers shake hands?\n\n&gt; Furthermore in 1755, the bill of Naju happened. Somebody lived in Naju posted a bill on a public wall indicating Youngjo as a thief who stole the crown from Gyeongjong. Youngjo completely lost his control since the case hit him on his score point. Everybody involved in this cased tore to death.\n\nFinally, the end.\n\nFirst, I am not aware of what exactly the propaganda pamphlet-because that's what the thing was, really-said. The *Annals* don't mention its contents (this is annoyingly common).  But I'm fairly certain it accused Yeongjo of not being Sukjong's son, among other things. \n\nSecond, the claim that everyone involved in this incident was \"torn apart\" is ridiculous. Even after having been king for three decades, Yeongjo was still wary of complete Noron dominance. A significant number of more moderate Soron officials were spared, and some of the people involved died by methods a bit more gruesome than being torn apart.",

The first post, [A Handful of Adventurers Topple Empires](http://np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2qn5us/myths_of_conquest_part_one_a_handful_of/), addressed the written foundation of the conquistador mythos. The second post, [Invisible Allies](http://np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2r3svv/myths_of_conquest_part_two_invisible_allies/), examined the role of Native American armies, and the underlying politics, that allowed for the overthrow of Tenochtitlan. The third post [A Completed Conquest](http://np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2rjw9r/myths_of_conquest_part_three_a_completed_conquest/) explored how crown policy and the reward process demanded a portrayal of conquest as complete despite centuries of continual military conflict. The fourth post, [Miscommunication](https://np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2ryuks/myths_of_conquest_part_four_miscommunication/), addressed the myths of miscommunication that permeate popular discussions of conquest. This post responds to the myth of Native American desolation in the years following conquest.\n\nFor the first few entries of the series, I’ll heavily rely on Restall’s *Seven Myths of the Spanish Conquest* as a jumping off point to establish a baseline rebuttal to the most prevalent contact period myths. Subsequent posts will focus on topics in my own area of research. If you see any errors, let me know so I can fix them and learn from my mistakes.\n\nHere we go…\n\n**The Myth: Native American Surrender, Desolation, and Extinction**\n\nThe myth of native desolation incorporates multiple sub-myths to form a greater narrative painting post-contact Americas as an apocalyptic wasteland. Shattered remnants and refugees, mere shells of a once proud and numerous people (if you like the “noble savage” motif), try in vain to survive in a new world of death and disease following Spanish contact. Conversely, if you think there wasn’t much here in the first place, the Spanish sweep away the few inhabitants of the New World, unveiling a pristine paradise ripe for European colonization. Restall states\n\n&gt; In its most extreme form, this perspective not only emphasizes depopulation and destruction, but perceives a more profound desolation amounting to a state of anomie. When a society is in a state of anomie its individuals are suffering from a sense of futility, emotional emptiness, psychological despair, and a confusion over the apparent breakdown of previous systems of value and meaning. (p.102)\n\nThe myth of native desolation incorporates many individual myths either encountered in previous posts, or myths I plan to address in the future. These sub-myths include the completion of conquest, the universal application of a &gt; 95% mortality figure, the inevitable decline narrative, and the myth of a simple/static people incapable of adapting to the challenges of contact.\n\nNative desolation can be traced to growing European religious turmoil and the publications of early *relaciónes*, like those of Bartolomé de las Casas, that described, in great detail, a litany of atrocities in the first years of contact. *Relaciónes* fueled the construction of the Black Legend, a narrative that developed concurrent with growing English-Spanish hostility and the repercussions of the Reformation. The Black Legend painted Roman Catholic Spaniards as brutal, violent colonists inhumanly subjugating the poor inhabitants of the New World. The narrative underscores desolate Native American populations wilting away under the burning sun of Spanish oppression, conveniently leaving Protestant colonists free of blame. \n\nThreads of the Black Legend persisted in Protestant populations into the eighteenth century where the myth was common knowledge among the English, Dutch, and Prussian citizens of the newly minted United States. After the U.S. Revolution, the myth of native desolation integrated itself into the creation story of the Unites States, infusing our narrative of early interactions with Native American populations with the theme of inevitable decline. The mid-nineteenth century policies of Indian removal contributed to the perception of a forlorn race doomed to extinction. Recently, the universal application of catastrophic mortality due to introduced infectious disease re-emphasized the myth of native desolation in the popular consciousness.\n\nThis entry will revolve around the larger theme of Native American desolation after contact. As stressed in the second post, Invisible Allies, the popular narrative of conquest strips Native American populations of agency, forcing them into reactionary positions instead of driving events on their own terms. The third post, A Completed Conquest, examined resistance through armed conflict. Here we’ll focus on the abundant evidence of cultural persistence that underscores vibrant communities surviving, adapting, and renewing in the wake of contact. The next post will provide a specific illustration of Native American persistence in what is commonly regarded as one of the most oppressive manifestations of Spanish conquest: the mission system. For now, though, I’ll address the greater myth of desolation, and provide a brief overview of how Native American communities in Mexico emphasized their vitality in the years following the overthrow of Tenochtitlan. \n\n**The Reality: Survival, Adaption, and Persistence**\n\nContrary to the claims of the Black Legend, Spain never intended to widow the New World of its original inhabitants. Bluntly stated, as armed conquest gave way to long-term colonization, New Spain needed a viable native population to exploit. Colonies required Native American labor to grow food, mine precious metals, transform raw materials into trade items, fight ongoing battles of conquest, and use existing native power structures to oversee payment of taxes/tribute. With the tragic lessons of demographic collapse in the Caribbean, and the 1521 smallpox epidemic still fresh in the minds of colonial governors, some of the first attempts to protect natives (like the [New Laws of the Indies for the Good Treatment and Preservation of the Indians](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Laws)) emerged within two decades of the fall of Tenochtitlan. Officially, *repartimiento* replaced *encomiendas* in New Spain, and concerns with declining Native American populations continued to increase over time. In 1573 the Comprehensive Royal Orders for New Discoveries banned the entry of unlicensed *entradas* into new lands, and prohibited violence against Indians, under threat of fine or death. Of course, exploitation continued, the total Native American population of New Spain declined until ~1600, and illegal Indian slavery persisted wherever/whenever the will or the power of the local government faltered in upholding official law. Let me stress this; *colonialism sucked*. However, the full measure of colonial abuses could not extinguish the strength of Native American populations. \n\nThough we often perceive conquest as an irrevocable break from previous Native American lifeways, the years immediately following the siege of Tenochtitlan was, relatively, a period of stasis for the bulk of Native Americans living under nominal Spanish rule. As /u/400-Rabbits eloquently stated [here](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/25y5j0/what_was_daily_life_like_for_the_indigenous/chmcx1y)\n\n&gt; In the early period, the Spanish simply did not have the numbers to radically reshape Aztec society. Instead, they did what would be the hallmark of colonialists everywhere and relied upon the pre-existing socio-political structures, just with themselves now at the top.\n\nWe’ve previously addressed the vital need for Native American allies to assist the ongoing fight to consolidate control and fight an unfinished conquest in greater Mexico. The colonial government conscripted existing indigenous power structures to help govern new colonies, organize labor, and collect taxes/tribute in processes similar to those present before European arrival. For members of the lower classes, therefore, not much changed. Crops still needed tending, production of worked goods continued, and taxes on those efforts now flowed through the local elites to the new Spanish rulers. \n\nIn a multitude of ways, the indigenous communities of New Spain negotiated the gradual transition to colonial rule by incorporating useful traits while simultaneously resisting unwanted influence. As Gibson states, “Indians accepted one aspect of Spanish colonization in order to facilitate their rejection of another.” Over all, native communities continued to emphasize communal strength. Colonial policies concerning local governing were enforced in ways that promoted local elites and local interests. Native municipal communities and *cabildos* (town councils) were adapted into existing community practice and used to advocate for the needs of the settlement. Vibrant communities emphasized their vitality, holding plays, dances, mock battles, and festivals that celebrated community survival/continuity, often melding traditional ritual performance with elements of Spanish theatrical tradition. Community histories, *títulos*, emphasized continuity of status, residency, and occupation of the ruling elite, as well as their subordinates. In these histories, instead of a forlorn narrative detailing the desolation of a people, the \n\n&gt; Mayas placed the Spanish invasion, and the violence and epidemics it brought, within the larger context of history’s cycles of calamity and recovery, relegating the Conquest to a mere blip in their long-term local experience. (Restall, p.122)\n\nThe smallpox epidemic that accompanied the siege of Tenochtitlan, as well as wave upon wave of later epidemics, specifically the autochthonous [cocoliztli epidemics in 1545 and 1576 that killed 7-17 million in highland Mexico](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2730237/), initiated a period of demographic decline that undermined the existing native power structure. Unlike North America, where the native population would hit its lowest total population by 1900, the population nadir for Mexico occurred in the late sixteenth century. After 1600 the negotiated change in social governance gave way to more rapid transitions reflecting the substantial loss of Native American population base. However, the established foundation of vital indigenous communities adapting and maintaining their history, ensured the development of a diverse, multi-ethnic colony. This deep structure remains, visible in the cultural, ethnic, and [genetic diversity](http://www.nature.com/news/sweeping-diversity-seen-in-mexican-genomes-1.15403) of modern Mexico and [New Mexico](http://heritagenm.unm.edu/index). As centuries unfolded, continual interaction resulted in the development of new cultures, often neither wholly indigenous nor wholly Spanish, reflecting the complex web of interdependence present throughout the empire.\n\nInstead of trying to cram too much here, I’ll expand further on the themes of accommodation, compromise, and resistance in the next myths of conquest post. The examination of life in the missions along the northern frontier will highlight how Native Americans actively negotiated Spanish colonialism on their own terms. Subsequent posts will examine the specific sub-myths within the desolation narrative.\n\nMore myths of conquest to come.

I know this is ridiculously close to breaking Rule 2, which is why I've asked mods if it was okay if I post this and they said it's fine if I don't touch the actual political bits.\n\nThe offending parts:\n\n&gt;the outright fascism of the 1920s and 1930s, when Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini espoused doctrines of racial superiority, is a slippery one. Scholars continue to debate whether Mussolini was even fascist — or simply an opportunistic nationalist.\n\nNazism is related to fascism and might be considered a subset of that ideology, but they aren't they same at all. That,  and 'racial superiority' wasn't part of the doctrine of Mussolini until 1938, when he published the Racial Manifesto under the influence of Hitler. Hey, up until 1938 jews could even register in the fascist party of Italy, and (one of) Mussolini's mistresses was jewish.\n\n*Prior* to that he really didn't care about race. Well, no more than the other contemporary politician I suppose. Here's a quote from 1932:\n\n&gt;Race? It is a feeling, not a reality. Ninety-five per cent, at least. Nothing will ever make me believe that biologically pure races can be shown to exist today.… National pride has no need of the delirium of race.\n\nAlso, since he literally is the founder of the first fascist movement I'm pretty sure Mussolini can be considered a fascist and scholars don't actually debate this.\n\n&gt;After World War Two, nationalism largely went into remission in Europe. Until recently, nationalist parties were largely regarded as a noisy but fringe phenomenon. The notion that they would gain public respectability — let alone wield power — seemed outlandish.

[These here](http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1945172!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/article_970/transitads19n-2-web.jpg) are the images in question. Most of it has to do with contemporary politics, but we find our bad history here at the bottom. \n\nOn the third panel, there is a inset image. And who is it but the ole Führer himself! But who is that he's with? Verbatim:\n\n&gt; Adolf Hitler and his staunch ally, *the leader of the Muslim world*, Haj amin Al-Husseini. \n\nIn the italics is the bad-history. I don't even have to look at al-Husseini to dismiss this sentence. \n\nWhat this in essence implies is that such a thing even existed, a 'leader of the Muslim world'. For that to exist, there would have to be one unified realm of the Muslims under one leader, correct? It might seem like a slight semantical hiccup, but language and how we word things are very powerful forces. There was once a time that this was the case, that a leade*r* (note:singular) of the Muslim world existed. But that was long, long ago. In fact, as far back as the first century of Islamic history. There is a precise moment that the Muslim Ummah, or community, was severed into multiple non-cooperative divisions.  And ergo, there was only approximately a 1 century span in which a unified Islamic state existed. \n\nThe word 'Caliphate' (Arabic: خِلافة‎ khilāfa) literally means 'successor'. Successor to what? To Muhammad ﷺ, in his capacity as absolute ruler of the Muslims. But he was a man, and like all men he died. So naturally this brings up the matter of 'who is to succeed him'. This issue has led to multiple wars, wanton bloodshed, and one of the most cataclysmic sectarian divides in history as various powers have used this issue to jockey for power. \n\nAs per Islamic sunnah, the Caliph is *not* a Monarch. A Khilafa is more aptly to be an administrator, an arbitrator, a figure of authority. But not an absolute Monarch. We know this through the example set by Muhammad himself and his immediate successors. The Rashidun or ['Rightly Guided' Calips](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashidun_Caliphate) are considered in Sunni Islam to be the most exemplary of all Islamic leaders. And as far as this post is concerned here, neither Abu Bakr, Umar ibn Al-Khattab, Uthman ibn Affan, nor Ali ibn Abi Talib claimed the title of Monarch. Remember, language is powerful, and the fact that in between these 4 men, succession was a matter of deliberation among peers, not hereditary succession, makes a statement. This process was forever disrupted at the hands of one man: [Muawiyah](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muawiyah_I) (Pronounced like this Moo-Eye-Uh). Who is Muawiyah? The founder of the Umayyad *Dynasty*. \n\nThe story surrounding Muawiyah himself and the clan he represented is very interesting history, and it has ramifications on global politics *to this day*. A good tool in understanding the early Arab period is the family tree. As a people, both before as after Islam, Arab society placed huge emphasis on lineage because the tribe was everything. It was the social community, it was the material support, it was the personal honor, it was quite frankly how one survived. In the deserts of Arabia, a man without a clan is at a severe disadvantage. So this idea of tribalism and filial kinship is a really big deal. [Here](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0a/Hashemite_Tree_2.PNG) we see the Hashemite family tree. This clan is arguably the most important ‘family’ in Arabic and Islamic history. On the right side we see the decent of Muawaiyah from Abd-al Shams, the brother of Hashim the patriarch of the Hashemites. Every single Umayyad Caliph was from this line. On the left side, we see Abbas, a Hashemite from whom descended every single Abbasid Caliph.  On the rivalry of these 2 clans has early Islamic history been defined. \n\nAll of this was to provide some essential background. Now that that’s done, to completely oversimplify some very complex history, there had been a degree of competition and even animosity between these two clans since long before the time of Muhammad. Muawaiyah enjoyed many powerful posts throughout his life, culminating as the Governor of Syria (hence why Damascus was the capital of his forthcoming dynasty). He was a shrewd and capable politician and general, which allowed him to consolidate power and become the Caliph after the 1st Muslim Civil War. Where everything changed, is when Muawaiyah declared his successor would be his son- thus breaking the tradition and officially turning the Caliphate into an imperial dynasty. His son, Yazid, would go on to secure allegiance from all save for Muhammad’s grandson, Hassan ibn Ali, whom he promptly had killed. Thus securing the Umayyad dynasty. For the next century, this dynasty ruled over the Muslim world as absolute *monarchs*. Over time they grew decadent and despised. Riding this wave of discontent, the Abbasids incited a successful revolution with the support of the people and overthrew the Umayyads. This came to a completion in 750. At that time, virtually every single member of the Umayyad Dynasty was killed. But survived the gifted prince, Abd Al Rahman, who fled from Damascus to Cordoba where he established the [Emirate of Cordoba](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emirate_of_C%C3%B3rdoba).  From this exact moment, with two functional and legitimate Islamic states under different leadership, no longer did there exist a ‘leader of the Muslim world’, because from that moment no longer was there a united Muslim world. This has remained true from 756 to this day. \n\n[If you refer to this more detailed family tree](http://i.imgur.com/Ey0cG.gif) and consider this contextual knowledge, it becomes clear that only Muhammad, the 4 Rashidun Caliphs, and the 14 Umayyad caliphs before the Abbasid revolution could be deemed singular leaders of a Muslim world. \n\n\nSo who exactly is [Haj amin al-Husseini?]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haj_Amin_al-Husseini). Obviously you can read the link. But he was a significant Muslim leader in Palestine during the Mandate period. By all means a significant historical figure, however his leadership and relevance was primarily over Palestine. Leader of/in Mandatory Palestine =! Leader of the Muslim world. As my post has attempted to explain, there has been no singular Muslim world to be led under one leader since the 750s ce. Thus, there was no 'leader of the Muslim world' for Hitler to collude with, as there hadn't been for the 1200 years prior to when that photo was snapped.\n\n**TL;DR**: **There was no united 'Muslim world', and thus no universally acknowledged leader of the Muslims since 756 CE**. Neither Hitler nor photography existed back then, so this caption is bullshit.\n\nI’ll wrap up with a few fun facts.\n\n**Fun Fact #1**: According to Arab tradition, Hashim (patriarch of the hashemites) and Abd al-shams were born conjoined.- Hashim’s foot to his twin brother’s head. Their father took a sword cleaved the two asunder, and in the process some blood flew. Observers commented that this signified blood would be spilt between the two men and their respective progenies. As fate would have it, this would manifest some 2 hundred years later in the Abbasid revolution, among other conflicts between the two clans. \n\n**Fun Fact #2**: Abd al-Shams, meaning ‘servant of the sun’, was the Patriarch of the Umayyads while Hashim was the Patriarch of Muhammad and the Abbasids. Bilad al-Sham was the Arab designation for the provinces of Syria and the Levant, the region out of which Muawaiyah built his family’s power base, and from whence he usurped the Caliphate for Abd al-Shams bloodline. I don’t know if the two are etymologically linked in Arabic, but its still a neat little coincidence. \n\n\n**Fun Fact #3**: The Hashemite’s live and rule to this day, the most notable one being [This guy](http://www.plaidavenger.com/images/uploads/King_Abdullah_on_Star_Trek.jpg), ~~Starfleet deckhand~~ King of Jordan, [Abdullah II](http://theroyalcorrespondent.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/jordan.jpg). \n\n**Fun Fact #3**: After fleeing from his beloved home in Syria to the far away land of the Vandals, Abd al-Rahman  (a budding poet) wrote this somber lamentation to a Palm tree:\n\n “A palm tree stands in the middle of Rusafa\n\nBorn in the West, far from the land of palms\n\nI said to it, “How like me you are, far away and in exile!\n\nIn long separation from family and friends\n\nYou have sprung from soil in which you are a stranger\n\nAnd I, like you, am far away from home”\n\nHe saw this tree as sharing his own fate. \n\nAnd finally, I leave you guys with one of my favorite web tools, [Geacron](http://geacron.com/), so as to illustrate my points.\n\n632-756 United Muslims world under 1 leader, the only span of time that Muslims could reasonably be appraised as a political monolith.\n\n757- not so much\n\n757-2015 dozens, and dozens, and dozens of Muslims states and leaders, none with a legitimate claim as 'leader of the Muslim world'. \n\n\n",

        "text": "This post brought to you by Woodford Reserve: \"If it ain't Woodford, it ain't good(ford).\"\n\nSince, according to a pm I received, I'm apparently a bipolar, psychotic Nazi who likes to capriciously ban people just for expressing their opinions, take that into consideration in how you respond to me. /s\n\nSo anyway, the tale begins with [this thread](http://np.reddit.com/r/history/comments/2s2xi7/the_us_civil_war_a_proclamation_issued_by_the_sc/) in /r/history, which has been the subject of a lot of anti-censorship (I would call it anti-quality standards) discussion and drama. That's not why I'm making the post. I'd rather get into the common opinions associated with Southern secession and the American Civil War that have expectedly come up thanks to an honest submission by a redditor who, I suspect, was caught a bit off guard by the response his submission generated. It's an utter clusterfuck, so I'm going to stick to the things that stuck out for me.\n\nFirst off, there was a lot of history that was bad, but not *awful*. If I had had more time, I would've responded to some of that in the thread, but I'll do so instead here. One of the tendencies that I've come across is the redditors who become overzealous in their challenging Lost Cause nonsense, in so doing replacing one poorly nuanced view for another. A common example of this is when people assert that appeals to states' rights are everywhere just a euphemism for slavery. This is untrue, as states' rights was an actual concern held by many southerners. At the same time, commitment to states' rights was not even equatable with secessionism, much less slavery. There's no other way to account for Jackson's views on centralized power, with his simultaneous commitment to the Union. Same thing with a lot of Democrats in the Northern and Border states, and even plenty in the South. This comment isn't so bad, but does try to reduce the conflict to one of central vs. local power:\n\n&gt;In a sense the issue was state power v. federal power, hence \"states rights.\" The South knew that, with Lincoln's election, the federal government was to forever be controlled by free states, and thus federal laws hostile to slavery could be passed.\n\n&gt;Slave states simply refused to be a part of a nation with an anti-slave federal government, even though slavery was not directly threatened, and even Lincoln and the Republicans were happy to keep it legal where it existed.\n\nThe problem was that Southern grievances prior to secession, and those grievances explicitly cited in justifying their secession, were often at odds with a commitment to decentralized government in any generalized sense, as particularly politicians in the Deep South were perfectly content with federal power being wielded in support of slavery and a guarantee of its viability and expansion. They were fine with forcing northern states to abide the Fugitive Slave Act, which was a specific point of contention in the 1850 Georgia Platform. Georgia essentially outlined what it would take for Georgia to secede,^1 and failure to enforce the FSA nationally was emphasized heavily. In the linked content in the post, S. Carolina does the same. They favored the part of outcome of *Dred Scott* that allowed Southerners to retain their 'property' while spending periods in non-slave states, which is a use of federal law to undermine the ability of a state to individually eliminate slavery within its borders. The contrast to this is that Republicans also detested that decision for stripping the federal government of the authority to dictate policies concerning slavery in federal territories, which is an instance of decentralized authority working in favor of the South. However, wealthy Southerners would've favored federal authority being used to allow slavery's expansion just as much as they disdained the attempts at using federal authority to contain slavery. Essentially wherever federal power was expedient to enforcing and expanding slavery, the Southern Democrats took the pro-federal stance.\n\nI also take some issue with the second paragraph, as Lincoln's stance and Southern attitudes towards it are commonly misunderstood. It was containment of slavery that was the more real threat to the Southern elite, which is why the proposed 13th Amendment (Corwin) did not satisfy the Deep South after secession. To them, the plantation model had to be exported for both political reasons (balance of power at the federal level) and economic reasons (fear of devaluation of slaves in the Upper South and the ongoing concentration of slavery to the Deep South). I brought this up somewhere in the linked thread, and I actually got challenged on this point:\n\n&gt;Also, in truth, slave owners had no reason to fear devaluation of slaves. It was in their interest for slaves to hold their value as property.\n\nNow, this makes absolutely no sense as a response. I was referring to a fear that the wealthy in the Deep South actually did hold at the time, which was that a geographic containment of slavery would expedite a perceived trend of devaluation and southward concentration of slavery, the latter further expediting the former. Historian David Blight described it as a Southern slave economy essentially \"imploding on itself,\" it being a critical argument for the expansion of slavery beyond where it already existed. Arguments for the existence of slavery itself were generally the result of a widely-held Burkean conservatism, with actual fear of a post-slavery society also being very critical. Even if these were simply paranoid delusions on the part of the Southern elite, that is absolutely irrelevant when we consider that my comment was dealing with a phenomenon that actually occurred and factored into a historical sequence of events. To me it seems like a fundamental misunderstanding of what history is about—which is not to look at past events and then proceed to ignore the motivations of people influencing and reacting to them in favor of your own speculative judgements. The same person then said this:\n\n&gt;Let us remember that in the Confederate states outside of Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, and the Carolinas were slave ownership is estimated at 15%-18% of the population, only about 5% of the population were slave owners, and most slaves were held by the wealthy. Slaves were a valuable commodity to the rich and competition to anyone else.\n\nI go into some of the figures [here with actual sourcing and geographic breakdown of certain figures,](http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2hrtxe/rwtf_and_slavery_apologia_the_problems_with/) so I'll just leave that as a response to this point.\n\nThere are other comments like this one:\n\n&gt;Except the Confederacy's \"Federal\" government has constantly been attributed as one of their failings during the war. In fact check this excerpt from Wikipedia about their reverence for states rights \"Historian Frank Lawrence Owsley argued that the Confederacy \"died of states' rights.\"[6][195] The central government was denied requisitioned soldiers and money by governors and state legislatures because they feared that Richmond would encroach on the rights of the states. Georgia's governor Joseph Brown warned of a secret conspiracy by Jefferson Davis to destroy states' rights and individual liberty.\"\n\n&gt;Do I agree with the Confederacies values? No, I think slavery is abhorrent. But I also believe that the cause of states rights is important and I also believe that history isn't as cut and dry as many people seem to make it out to be.\n\nOne of the things I've never understood is why the perceived need to include a disclaimer saying that they don't support slavery doesn't automatically send up a red flag telling them that there might be something wrong with their post. If the rest of what you're saying doesn't instill enough confidence in your own ability to not sound like a white supremacist who supports chattel slavery, then you should reconsider what you're saying, or not say it at all. Anyway, I responded to this point as well, so I'll lazily paste what I said:\n\n&gt;The problem isn't that states' rights didn't exist as an ideology, and as one many southerners ascribed to. The problem is that you're misconstruing how states' rights factors into secession. The survival and expansion of slavery was a concern that preceded any concerns about the nature and scope of federal power (for the Deep South at the very least). They were perfectly happy with a stronger federal government if it meant securing slavery. Beliefs concerning the nature of the Union or \"compact\" of states certainly factor into the Southern decision to secede, though as a major cause for secession this is only really applicable to the delayed secession of the states that seceded subsequent to Lincoln's response to Ft. Sumter.\n\nThis is a bit redundant considering what I've already written above, but it allows me to segue into another issue that I've been seeing: the conflict between expanding upon the complexities of the period, and using that complexity to distract away from slavery as a central theme.\n\nAn instance of using 'federalism' to do this:\n\n&gt;[Federalism was probably the most important political issue since the first draft of the constitution. It was an extremely debated issue about the time of the civil war and was likely more on the mind of politicians than southern slavery. Basically, the south was running with an interpretation of the constitution that was widely accepted so the question goes back to the civil war was a war to police the governing constitution or one of aggression.\n](http://np.reddit.com/r/history/comments/2s2xi7/the_us_civil_war_a_proclamation_issued_by_the_sc/cnmbp19)\n\nA couple of my explanations of the problems with this example are included in the link. Here's a brief excerpt from my explanation: \"Which is exactly why it's not as helpful in telling us why secession happened *when it did.* It's useful in telling us why secession was a course of action the South took, but not why they took to it in 1860-1861. Which is why I take issue with its use by certain folks to say that they're adding nuance. Yes, there's nuance in the background information, but appealing to that ongoing debate as a cause for Southern secession is actually *less specific.\"*\n\nThe same thing being done with tariffs:\n\n&gt;[Slavery was important to many of the wealthy men in power who actually voted to secede, but so were tariffs, which actually hurt way more farmers than just the 10%-ish who owned slaves.](http://np.reddit.com/r/history/comments/2s2xi7/the_us_civil_war_a_proclamation_issued_by_the_sc/cnm1vd3)\n\nAgain, there are some responses in the thread, including me putting in my two cents. My biggest issue is that we have a major example of a crisis over a tariff that was significantly higher than even the Morrill rate, and it didn't even push S. Carolina to secede. Even if tariffs were a grievance that a lot of Southerners had, there's no reason to believe that it's the sectional issue that precipitated secession. That was obviously slavery. Again, I go more into detail there.\n\nAnother common argument I see to distract from Southern motives is the idea that it wasn't about slavery for the North. Not really all that bad, but I've got some beef with it, both for its content and how it's used. I know I've written about that before, but I'd rather just link to [this lovely post,](http://np.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/2s66ks/seriously/) in which one can find a comment by me where I elaborate on my issue with this statement. Also involved there is a very unfair comparison of Grant to Lee, which somehow concludes that Grant was somehow more hypocritical than Lee with regard to his position on slavery. If I recall correctly, I believe /u/smileyman is especially fond of this one.\n\nI'm pretty sure I also saw some comments in that thread or somewhere in the meta posts that noted that slavery was on the way out, and that Lincoln was foolish for wasting his time. I know Ron Paul loves rehashing this drivel. What I don't get is why this is used as an affront to Lincoln, but not the Southerners that were *actively trying to preserve it.*\n\nSurprisingly, I didn't see any citations of DiLorenzo, though you all already must be aware of my [many beefs](http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2h3g9x/in_a_thread_about_how_fdr_was_literally_hitler/ckp6mb1) with that [awful, awful being.](http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2i2csy/welcome_to_oh_no_not_another_civil_war_post_i_got/)\n\n1. \"Fourthly, That the State of Georgia in the judgment of this Convention, will and ought to resist even (as a last resort,) to a disruption of every tie which binds her to the Union, any action of Congress upon the subject of slavery in the District of Columbia, or in any places subject to the jurisdiction of Congress incompatible with the safety, domestic tranquility, the rights and honor of the slave-holding States, or any refusal to admit as a State any territory hereafter, applying, because of the existence of slavery therein, or any act prohibiting the introduction of slaves into the territories of New Mexico and Utah, or any act repealing or materially modifying the laws now in force for the recovery of fugitive slaves.\"",

Abel. And OH MY GOD it is so freaking awful, I think my IQ dropped a whole bunch.\n\n* First off, Mr. Abel mention the Minoans, describing how [Manfred Bietrak](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manfred_Bietak), an Austrian Egyptologist, whose main work is on excavating several city sites on the Nile Delta, apparently \"unearthed evidence from artwork as early as 7000 B.C. that depicts the early people inhabiting Greece were of African descent.\" A look into Minoans' mitochondrial DNA reveals that \"genetically very similar to modern-day Europeans — and especially close to modern-day Cretans, particularly those from the Lassithi Plateau. They were also genetically similar to Neolithic Europeans, but **distinct from Egyptian or Libyan populations.**\"[1](http://www.nature.com/ncomms/journal/v4/n5/full/ncomms2871.html#f5). Was there any Minoan contact with Egyptian or North African traders? Of course. And were there any Egyptians brought along? I would say so. But that doesn't mean that the *entire* Minoan race was black. So strike one there, Mr. Abel.\n\n* Secondly, the discussion of the 'Indus Kush civilization', otherwise known as the Harrappans. They may be black in the British sense (id est they are non-African but with high melanin levels), but they aren't of African descent. Skeletal remains show that the Harrapans \"belonged to \\[the] proto-Australoid, Mongoloid, Mediterranean and Alpine\" ethnicities.[2](http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=x3Rt9b86t94C&amp;pg=PT26&amp;lpg=PT26&amp;dq=proto-Australoid,+Mongoloid,+Mediterranean+and+Alpine&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=84IHlx_gFV&amp;sig=-5ybIQ3JeoJ2s4rxGbj_42kud6Q&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=CP0XVOPsEoKw7AbEs4GICA&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=proto-Australoid%2C%20Mongoloid%2C%20Mediterranean%20and%20Alpine&amp;f=false)\n\n* The Olmecs, the third group to have their history slaughtered by Mr. Abel, apparently came from Sierra Leone. Therefore, all of the Native Mexicans are black! Just... Wow. This is simply so damn stupid I ain't going to waste my time on this. \n\n* Shang China is on here? The hell?

Also, King Tang, the first Shang king, was apparently black. I'd love to see the source for this.\n\n*Finally, the Mesopotamians are black, according to Abel. Here he actually makes a little bit of sense, because it's not impossible that maybe Kushites and Proto-Egyptians migrated eastward. They *are* close enough,  But just because the Sumerians are dark-skinned DOES NOT MEAN that they are  actually African. \n\nAnd with a sigh, I conclude this post by saying that this is, in my opinion, complete bullshit, and I feel pretty damn stupid just reading this. \n\nAny corrections or contrary arguments are welcome, as long as they've got actual historical basis.

But I can show you this article is crap from the very title: \n\n&gt;**Does anyone have the balls to bring back castrati?: A good castrato today would without question become the richest singer of his time**\n\nWithout question eh? Mmmmmm well I for one have some questions. I really don’t believe he would. I believe he would be a moderately successful operatic singer singing to a specialized audience, opera fans are about 2-3% of the United States, which is the country that consumes the 2nd most opera, so way less than 1% for a global rate of people who might give a shit. And, actually, most opera fans do not like baroque opera, so it would be an even smaller audience. My boss (who I otherwise adore and is basically my work-dad) goes to maybe 3-5 operas a year but can’t stand baroque, he’s a devout Wagnerite. He’s not going to give two poops that castrati came back. The majority of today’s operatic canon is closed to our theoretical castrato. [Take a look at the top 50 most performed operas in the world today.](http://operabase.com/top.cgi?lang=en) There isn’t a role written for his voice type in any of these. This guy would be limited to Handel revivals and co-opting women’s roles, unless the entire audience of opera changed tastes developed over about a century to make a home for him. \n\nIs there something, like, the opposite of Presentism? “Pastism!” My husband quipped at me when I was complaining last night. I don’t know, maybe that’s what the author’s got, a bad case of Pastism, thinking that the present has the same tastes as the past. Its pretty weird. \n\nThis article at its core is based on an enduring myth, which is that what killed the castrati was people not liking castrating children. I’m sorry to say that’s a no. People, on the macro-level and excluding abuse, do what they think is best for their children, and if castrating your child is what’s best for him, someone's going to do it. But it wasn’t anymore. **What killed the castrati is that opera changed.** Opera got louder, it got more intense, it got more Romantic, “verismo,” realistic, and artifice was out, the castrato was basically just too tacky in the 19th century operatic environment. [Here’s the “warm” reception one of the last operatic castrati got when he was out of fashion:](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1oi0ns/tuesday_trivia_historys_greatest_nobodies/ccs3y3o) \n\n&gt;[...] still we cannot help regretting the reappearance of a sort of vocalism which is completely the reverse of natural, and which we had hoped had become merely historical. The fine muscular singing of Lablache [a bass], in the bold and stirring aria from Handel’s opera of *Orlando,* was a noble contrast. [...] \n\nThis was in 1844. I see no reason 2015 would react any differently. \n\nThe author takes this myth on the road though: \n\n&gt;Their decline began when women were fully accepted on the operatic stage, and as more modern notions of acceptable cruelty began to inform legal systems, though it wasn’t until 1903 that Pope Pius X finally banned them from the Sistine Chapel Choir. \n\nWrong wrong wrong. Women were fully active in opera in the heyday of the castrati, and scrapping for roles right next to the castrati everywhere where they were not banned. Women were only banned in a few cities, notably Rome, and that was the only big opera scene where they were banned. Actually the first opera stars in 17th century Venice were women, [Anna Renzi would probably like to have some words with you for this slight, Spectator.](http://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft3199n7sm&amp;chunk.id=d0e11816&amp;toc.id=d0e11463&amp;brand=ucpress) If anyone killed the castrato, it was the tenor, not the women, as he [souped up his music with louder, manlier, more muscular, deeply penetrating notes,](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1m3qzr/tuesday_trivia_twists_and_turns_watershed_moments/cc5idox) which were more in line with the operatic styles and Romantic ideals of the 19th century. \n\nCastrati and the legal system is a bit more tricky. **It was always illegal to castrate children for music, just no one gave a shit.** You had to have a “medical reason” to do it, and just like smoking that dank for your glaucoma, turns out everyone had a medical reason. (See my comments on castrating children above.) The market for castration has, somewhat curiously, moved independently of any laws about it, but there is a good argument that it moved with the economy (I’m currently researching that). [According to my best research the castrati phenomenon effectively ended about 1760](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/2fjtoy/friday_freeforall_september_05_2014/ck9wjek), the guys of that generation just working through their career in the early 19th century but no set of replacements on the way. This is earlier than any of the legal efforts sometimes held up as the end to the castrati, such as Napoleonic Italy in the early 19th century which had a crack-down law on musical castration. Not that anyone cared. \n\nWell anyway. Here’s the concluding paragraph: \n\n&gt;The irony behind this story is that were a really good soprano castrato to hit the headlines today, he would without question become the most sought after and the richest singer of his time. Yes, we could experience for ourselves the horror, revulsion, prurient fascination and strange attraction towards these ‘capons’ — as the English had it — not to mention the wild admiration. And we could hear for ourselves that eerie, agile, sexily sexless tone of voice which the greatest composers of the period, including Handel and Gluck, wrote for. What is it worth?\n\nIt’s worth the cost of exactly whatever that poor kid’s health care plan will not cover, babe. You can mutilate all the little boys you like, unless you recreate 18th century society and their operatic training methods the castrati are dead.

        "text": "(Repost from last month because I forgot to check whether there was a moratorium on new atheist bad history.)\n\nFrom the [‘We Fucking Love Atheism' Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/WFLAtheism/photos/a.272658686141957.63954.272308546176971/795960930478394/?type=1&amp;permPage=1). (The lowest hanging fruit is the sweetest of fruits.)\n\nThe setup: a worked-up Christian complains that Christmas is about Christ and should be known as such. 'It's *Christ*mas, not *X*mas!' Of course this is already bad history, because 'Xmas' is not a secular shorthand for the holiday but derives from the long-standing Christian practice of abbreviating Christ's name with an X or an X-like symbol (i.e. the [Chi Rho](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi_Rho)). So although it may appear that the usage is an attempt to 'take Jesus out of Christmas’, the practice is relatively benign one.\n\nEnter the atheist hero, however, who bravely points out that Christmas is *really* a pagan tradition.\n\n&gt; Actually December 25th originated as a pagan holiday the winter solstice, which was reformed by Ancient Rome as Saturnalia. It was a holiday of lawlessness where people can be happy, drunk, merry. They sing naked in the streets, have fights, and even rape, all in the consent of the Empire. This holiday was celebration to the birth of the sun god in Northern parts of Europe where it was called Yule, and in Rome the birth of the Sun as the god Saturn.\n\nAlready we’re deep in speculative nonsense, trying to draw a tenuous thread between festivals that emerged in different places, were celebrated by different peoples, and evolved over time. Although Saturnalia came to be celebrated at about the time of the winter solstice, it was not a reformed version of any pre-existing ‘pagan’ winter solstice festival. In fact, according to [History Today](http://www.historytoday.com/matt-salusbury/did-romans-invent-christmas), Saturnalia ‘originated as a farmer’s festival to mark the end of the autumn planting season’. An agricultural festival, in other words, rather than an astronomical one. Likewise, the connection between Yule and Saturnalia isn’t demonstrated. Yule is based on Odin-worship, and Odin is not a sun god. (References to an unnamed ‘northern Sun god’ notwithstanding). \n\n&gt; In 350AD the pope integrated this holiday as Christmas and declared Jesus’ birthday on December 25th. \n\nAccording to [History Today](http://www.historytoday.com/matt-salusbury/did-romans-invent-christmas), ‘the earliest known reference to [Christmas] commemorating the birth of Christ on December 25th is in the Roman Philocalian calendar of AD 354.’ However, this does not mean that Saturnalia was integrated into Christmas, and indeed Saturnalia was still being celebrated by Christians as a distinct festival over a hundred years later.\n\n&gt; In actually fact, following history, Jesus would’ve been born sometime in September, some even say February.\n\nI think this is pretty non-controversial. I doubt there are any serious scholars who believe Jesus was actually born on 25th December. \n\n&gt; The christmas tree was from a pagan ritual of Yule, that was also integrated. It was to give hope that after winter, harvest would begin again. The tree was decorated, and put comfortable in their homes as a reminder. The gift giving was originated for the most despised people of the Roman empire to give tribute to the emperor, which then became localised to every family. \n\nAgain, we get more open conflagration of Yule with Saturnalia and, therefore, Christmas. Curiously, though, gift-giving wasn’t a Christmas tradition until the Victorian era. According to historian [Ronald Hutton](http://www.livescience.com/25779-christmas-traditions-history-paganism.html), it was a New Year’s tradition up until the nineteenth century. And the tree custom might have been inspired by Yule, but that hardly means Yule is the same as Christmas, particularly when it only became a Christmas custom in the sixteenth century. \n\n&gt; Saint Nicholas was a bishop that was born in Turkey and became a small cult sect by the celtics, Germanians and later the Dutch…\n\nAt first this struck me as deliberate obfuscation, where ‘celtics’ [sic] and ‘Germanians’ (Germanics?) are meant to imply that Nicholas was the subject of pagan worship. It would be simpler to state that he was a Byzantine bishop, venerated as a saint by Christians throughout Europe, who the modern, fictional Santa is based upon. And that hardly contradicts the notion of Christmas as a Christian festival.\n\nDigging a little deeper, though, I found [reference](http://www.hope-of-israel.org/cmas1.htm) to the book *When Santa Was a Shaman*, by Tony van Renterghem, where our atheist grinch is probably getting his information from. For example: \n\n&gt; In newly Christianized areas where the pagan Celtic and Germanic cults remained strong, legends of the god Wodan were blended with those of various Christian saints; Saint Nicholas was one of these.\n\nAll well and good, but van Renterghem is not an academic historian, and none of the above claims are referenced. I couldn’t find an electronic copy of the book, which has been out of publication since 1995, and he wasn’t reviewed in any historical journals, but [the one-star reviews on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/When-Santa-Was-Shaman-Christmas/product-reviews/156718765X/ref=cm_cr_dp_qt_hist_one?ie=UTF8&amp;filterBy=addOneStar&amp;showViewpoints=0) are pretty telling: ‘This work is a puerile mixed of cribbed Thomas Frazier (*The Golden Bough*) and nostalgic speculation about how wonderful things and people must have been during an imaginary pagan prehistory.’\n\n&gt; …which then became popularised a few novelists and illustrator from 1822 to 1886, and then finally put in everyone’s mind as a coca cola campaign in 1920 with his iconic red and white coat and hat.\n\nI think [Snopes](http://www.snopes.com/holidays/christmas/santa/cocacola.asp) has this one: 'As noted in a New York Times article published in 1927, four years before the appearance of Sundblom's first Santa-based Coca-Cola ad, the Santa Claus figure rendered by Sundblom was based upon what had already become the standard image of Santa'. Suffice to say, Coca-Cola neither developed nor popularised the red-and-white santa outfit.\n\n&gt;  So as one would complain not Xmas but CHRISTmas, one could also say not CHRISTmas, but Winter Solstice or Saturnalia or Yule… or we could all get along and call it whatever we want and celebrate it however we please. :)!\n\nI don’t really disagree with the sentiment that there isn’t a single or proper way to celebrate Christmas. But it isn’t the same festival as the pagan winter solstice, or Saturnalia, or Yule, and it's not really possible to conclude that they are all the same without cherry picking your evidence: i.e. 'St Nick is depicted as an old man in a white beard, therefore he must have been based on Odin'. Christmas has certainly borrowed traditions from other festivals, but that borrowing often came long after the fact and these festivals all have largely dysynchronous and parallel histories.",

        "text": "This is the fourth of what I hope will be a several part series of the myths of European conquest in the Americas. The first post, [A Handful of Adventurers Topple Empires](http://np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2qn5us/myths_of_conquest_part_one_a_handful_of/), addressed the written foundation of the conquistador mythos. The second post, [Invisible Allies](http://np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2r3svv/myths_of_conquest_part_two_invisible_allies/), examined the role of Native American armies, and the underlying politics, that allowed for the overthrow of Tenochtitlan. The third post [A Completed Conquest](http://np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2rjw9r/myths_of_conquest_part_three_a_completed_conquest/) explored how crown policy and the reward process demanded a portrayal of conquest as complete despite centuries of continual military conflict. Here I’ll address the myths of communication and miscommunication that permeate popular discussions of conquest.\n\nFor the first few entries of the series, I’ll heavily rely on Restall’s *Seven Myths of the Spanish Conquest* as a jumping off point to establish a baseline rebuttal to the most prevalent contact period myths. Subsequent posts will focus on topics in my own area of research. If you see any errors, let me know so I can fix them and learn from my mistakes. I freely admit to limits of my knowledge on this subject so, scholars of Native America, please feel free to add insights from your studies.\n\nHere we go…\n\n**The Myth: Complete Miscommunication**\n\nTwo opposite views on communication between Native Americans and the Spanish dominate the narrative of conquest. On one extreme, contemporary Spanish accounts said their reading of official claims to territory were understood by the Native American population in question. Conveniently, this perspective supported a completed conquest narrative whose terms were agreeable to the conquered nations. \n\nThe focus of this post is more on the other extreme: the myth that the geographic, linguistic, and cultural divide between Spaniards and Native Americas completely prevented the two parties from understanding each other. At best, communication devolved into a pantomime or comedy of errors. In the worst version of this narrative all manner of racist stereotypes support a naïve/superstitious/outright stupid Indian, and a haughty/oblivious/ignorant Spaniard, both incapable of understanding anything outside their previous frame of reference. \n\nThe theme of total miscommunication emerged early in conquest narratives. Bartolomé de las Casas critically emphasized the crude pantomime employed by Columbus during his voyages, as well as Columbus’ continual failure to understand the Caribbean natives. The narrative of miscommunication continued for centuries, and when combined with the atrocities that accompanied initial conquest, helped fuel the Black Legend. An extreme interpretation of the myth even led Margarita Zamora to argue Columbus had aphasia (a language disorder due to brain damage) that rendered him incapable of comprehending what he heard and witnessed in the Americas. Worst versions of the myth assume the Spanish too proud to learn native languages, regardless of circumstance, as the imperial Juggernaut plowed through the New World. \n\nConversely, other myths of miscommunication posit Native Americans were doomed to defeat because they could not read the human signs accompanying an invading force. Popular theories of misunderstanding by Native Americans appeal to ludicrous stereotypes such as inherently peaceful Indians who can’t understand war, or easily startled Indians continually ran away from guns because they go boom (for more info on conquest military history see /u/pseudogentry’s answer on [how the Aztec quickly adapted battle tactics](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/2pa7hf/civilizations_of_the_precolumbian_americas/cmuya21) to deal with cavalry and cannon). One of my least favorite, and sadly common, myths of miscommunication is the myth that the Aztecs saw Cortés as an incarnation of Quetzalcoatl. I don’t have the room to address the myth, but for a superb analysis check out /u/snickeringshadow’s post [here](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1rgsfl/is_there_any_truth_to_the_commonly_cited_fact/cdn7avv). /u/400-Rabbits likewise addresses [the myth that Native Americans thought horsemen were centaurs](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/268f4u/where_the_centaurs_really_based_on_the/chpklxk). You get the idea. Lots of racist badhistory involving misunderstanding and miscommunication is used to explain conquest.\n\nHere, we’ll address the various methods of establishing a baseline for communication. We’ll see how the Spanish and various Native American populations came to understand each other’s intentions, even if perfect communication lagged behind.\n\n**The Reality: Communication Through Translators and Context**\n\nThe second post of this series addressed the vital, yet invisible, role of Native American allies. Another form of invisible ally oft removed from the popular narrative is the role of translator. The assumption of initial contact conducted through pantomime may apply for the very first encounters, but humans communicate through a variety of mediums. Spaniards and Native Americans quickly developed methods of communication, both verbal and contextual.\n\nA common conquest method for developing translators involved luring, or outright forcing, a few inquisitive or unlucky young Native Americans onto ships during an initial, exploratory voyage. The reconnaissance voyage returned to a safe harbor, and the kidnapped Native Americans learned Spanish in preparation for their later role as translators during the *entrada*. As an example, Pizarro kidnapped two boys from the Peruvian coast in 1528. The young men were taken to Spain, learned Spanish, and accompanied the Conquest of Peru in 1531. They acted as translators during the famous showdown in Cajamarca in 1532 that resulted in Atahuallpa’s capture. The translators were rewarded for their service. Pizarro granted at least one of the two men, Martinillo, a share of the Cajamarca spoils. Martinillo changed his name to Don Martín Pizarro, and settled in Lima as the Interpreter General with two *encomiendas* to his name. \n\nShipwrecked or captive Spaniards were valued in Native American communities as translators and their ability to provide insight into European aims. As an example, in Florida the de Soto *entrada* encountered Juan Ortiz, a Spaniard captured while searching for the lost Narváez * expedition. Ortiz learned the Timucua language during his years in Florida and served as a translator while de Soto rampaged through the region. De Soto said of Ortiz, “This interpreter puts new life into us, for without him I know not what would become of us.” Ortiz refused wear Spanish dress while traveling with de Soto, and preferred the company of his Mocoso friends, possibly indicating his desire to keep them informed of Spanish intentions. See /u/Reedstilt’s answer about [mutually intelligible languages in the Southeast](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/2pa7hf/civilizations_of_the_precolumbian_americas/cmutaho) for a little more insight into indigenous translators conscripted by the de Soto *entrada*.\n\nKidnapped Native American translators could also escape their captives, and return to their homeland armed with new languages and valuable insight into European objectives. Don Luis de Velasco, a Native American abducted from the Virginia tidewater region in 1561 returned in 1571 with Franciscans establishing a mission near the James River. Don Luis escaped, and returned with an armed party that killed the Franciscan fathers. We may never know for sure, but there is sufficient reason to believe Don Luis was Opechancanough (“He Whose Soul is White”), brother of paramount chief Powhatan/Wahunsenacawh. Openchancanough would later advise his brother to violently oppose English settlement at Jamestown. His insight led Powhatan/Wahunsenacawh to expand the Powhatan Paramount Chiefdom to better oppose Spanish encroachment in the years preceding the English arrived in Virginia.\n\nEven when clunky, Native Americans and Spaniards used any means possible to communicate. The Conquest of Mexico famously required two translators. A shipwrecked Spaniard who lived for eight years among the Maya, Gerónimo de Aguilar, translated Spanish to Maya, and Dona Marina/La Malinche, a Nahua noblewoman from the frontier of Nahuatl-speaking central Mexico, then translated Maya to Nahuatl. The clunky Nahuatl to Maya to Spanish translation was abandoned once Dona Marina/La Malinche learned Spanish and could directly translate from Nahuatl to Spanish. Her constant presence near Cortés eventually led the Nahaus to dub Cortés Malinche, “as though captain and interpreter were one” (Restall, p. 83). As a final aside, I’ll include a brief mention of the many Catholic missionaries who worked to learn Native American languages. Documents like the Castilian-Timucuan catechism and confessional published in Mexico City in 1612 constitute the earliest surviving text of a North American Indian language.\n\nAs this very brief (and I’ll admit a bit scattered) overview attempted to show, the post-contact New World was a dynamic place with multiple methods for establishing communication through spoken language. Though we would be naïve to assume untrained translators, acting in tense situations and under immediate time constraints, adequately explained the complete context of convoluted messages like the *Requerimiento*, the myth of compete confusion does not represent the reality of communication during conquest. When words fail, humans read into another’s intentions and desires. Columbus could discern hostility when he approached a new island in the Caribbean and\n\n&gt; one of the Indians advanced into the river near the prow of the boat, and delivered a long speech…the Admiral…saw the face of the Indian whom he had taken with him, and who understands the language, change color, turn yellow as wax, and tremble mightily while saying by signs that the Admiral should leave the river because they sought to kill him. -de las Casas\n\nColumbus understood the danger of his situation without comprehending a word of the man’s speech. Likewise, Caribbean natives from burning, plundered villages understood a raider’s goals and intentions before they could speak a word of Spanish, or the Spanish a word of Taíno. The chiefdoms in the southeast, and the Pueblos in New Mexico understood pillaging during de Soto and Coronado’s *entradas*, and continually pointed the Spaniards onward to a (fictional) rich neighbor to usher the invaders away from their homeland. \n\nThe myth of miscommunication does not accurately capture the human capacity to converse either through rapid language acquisition, or the context of acts of aggression or peaceful encounters, or the multiple nonverbal cues that communicate our intent in the absence of a shared language. Sure there were miscues, and honest mistakes, and outright refusals to attempt to make themselves understood on all sides, but “forms and moments of miscommunication were more than equaled by more or less successful readings of the statements and intentions of the foreigners” (Restall, p. 98). The myth of two alien species encountering each other for the first time fails to explain the outcome of conquest. \n\nThanks for hanging in there with me for this one. Of all the myths of conquest this one is the furthest from my base of knowledge. I’ll be back in proper form next time. \n\nMore myths of conquest to come. Stay tuned.",

        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2rvc3p/this_document_claims_the_korean_comfort_women/",
        "text": "There is a growing number of Westerners who are becoming increasingly aware of the comfort women issue between Korea and Japan. Most have ran to the aid of the redress movement (the pro-Korean side). A few, however, have ran to the aid of the anti-redress movement (the pro-Japanese side). The most prominent of these is the somewhat popular conservative Youtuber Propagandabuster/TexasDaddy/Tony Marano, and most recently the award winning journalist Michael Yon (who so happens to be writing a book about this as well). Both [Marano] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rL9TCbBHQjs) and [Yon] (http://eng.the-liberty.com/2014/5641/) argue that the comfort women were (1) volunteers, (2) paid generously and (3) had the right to refuse service. They cite Report No.49, issued by the Office of War Information (OWI), October 1st, 1944 (which I'll add at the bottom of the post so you can read yourself). The report itself deals with the interrogation of about 20 Korean comfort women plus their two Japanese \"House masters\". To them, the report is the smoking-gun document which proves the right-wing narrative that the comfort women were paid prostitutes. Both of them emphasize the passages:\n\n\n&gt;\"A 'comfort girl' is nothing more than a prostitute or 'professional camp follower'\"\n\n\n&gt;\"They lived in near-luxury in Burma in comparison to other places... They lived well because their food and material was not heavily rationed and they had plenty of money with which to purchase desired articles. They were able to buy cloth, shoes, cigarettes, and cosmetics to supplement the many gifts given to them by soldiers who had received 'comfort bags' from home... While in Burma they amused themselves by participating in sports events with both officers and men, and attended picnics, entertainments, and social dinners. They had a phonograph and in the towns they were allowed to go shopping.\"\n\n\n&gt;\"The girls were allowed the prerogative of refusing a customer.\"\n\n\nWithout reading the document this would seem like solid evidence to back up their argument. In fact I believed this to be the case as well. However, upon reading the document I noticed something quite bizarre. The report actually contradicted much of their arguments. Contrary to illustrating the comfort women as volunteers and professional prostitutes, the report claimed the women were decieved, that they were previously unaware of prostitution before volunteering, that they had been decieved by claims they would be working in hospitals and factories, and that they were given advanced payments which turned out to be debts which would take up to a year to pay back\n\n\nThe report stated that the comfort women were \n&gt;\"... generally believed to be going to comfort wounded soldiers, as in going to hospitals to take care of them, putting on their bandages and so on...\", \n\nhow they had been promised \n&gt;\"...easy work in new land. A great future in Singapore\" \n\nand that beforehand\n&gt;\"The majority of the girls were ignorant and uneducated, although a few had been connected with 'oldest profession on earth'\"\n\n\nEven the report itself states the women had been decieved \n&gt;\"Many women believed these kinds of *false explanations*, applying for jobs overseas and getting a few hundred yen in advance payments\". \n\n\nSince when did deception equate to consent? Even Marano acknowledges \"some\" of the women were decieved into prostitution in the video description but that doesn't seem to impact the arguments in his videos at all.\n\n\nAdditionally, the report stated that the comfort women were tied down with debts from the advanced payments and could not leave until these debts were completed:\n\n&gt;\"They were *forced* to work under army regulations and for the ‘owner of the comfort station.’ The term depended on the amount of the advance payments, which their family obtained to clear off the debts. The term varied from six months to one year.\"\n\nPlease note the report used the word *forced*. Even so, if the comfort women had the \"prerogative of refusing a customer\" as Yon and Marano argue, did they have the \"prerogative of refusing to be a comfort woman\"? The report would suggest no. In fact, the report explicitly states the only way a comfort woman could go back to Korea is if they could pay back their debt. One does get the impression there was a subtle coercion. Yes, you can refuse customers - but you won't go home if you do. Furthermore, the women could *not* have went home at this stage of the war even if they had paid their debts. They were transported across the Pacific by ships at which by 1944 were being sunk by Allied submarines. Again, there is a subtle coercion here. Choosing between prostitution and most likely drowing at sea.\n\n\nWith regard to the money the Comfort Women earned, the report states that the women often had to pay extortionate prices for food and accomodation.\n&gt;\"Many \"masters\" made life very difficult for the girls by charging them high prices for food and other articles.\"\n\nThe report also claims the comfort women were paid 1,500 yen monthly. Of that, they had to give half (750) to the House Master. Additionally, they were paid in Burma in “Southern Development Bank Notes” The hyper inflation in Burma was 30 times that of Tokyo, meaning the 1,500 yen in Southern Development Bank Notes equated to about 50 yen. The report's claim, and Marano's and Yon's impression. that the comfort women could go into town and buy whatever they wanted with 50 yen is absurd.\n\n\nThe OWI report also stated that half the women were legally minors (under 21). Japan had signed the International Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Women and Children of 1910 and 1921 forbidding the trafficking of minors. So even if we do assume that\n\n1) These women volunteered knowing full well they'd be sent to brothels (not true)\n\n2) They had freedom to refuse service (also not true)\n\nThe trafficking of minors was a huge breach of Human rights, let alone international law, at the time. I suppose a prostitute under 21 today would not be much of a shock. There are, after all, plenty of pornstars who are 18. Nonetheless, this was a blatant disregard for international law.\n\nBefore either the pro-Korean or pro-Japanese side use this report it should be noted there are several drawbacks. The biggest being the number of comfort women interrogated, which the report claims was 20. Can we really generalize the experiences of 50,000-200,000 by citing the experiences of 20? It's impossible to assume that all comfort women were decieved, kidnapped, or that all volunteered through just by reading one report (as what many do on either side of the debate). Secondly the report recieved its information entirely from the two Japanese House masters. They would have undoubtedly gave information biased in their favour.\n\nMarano's and Yon's uncritical, no blatantly selective, use of passages from the report is just amazing. To claim the comfort women had free will and justify it with a report which *refuted* such a claim is beyond belief.\n\nSources:\n\nYou can read the full POW report [here] (http://texas-daddy.com/comfortwomen.htm).\n\nInformation on the report by two Japanese historians [here] (http://fightforjustice.info/?page_id=3367&amp;lang=en).\n\nInformation on the value of the money in Burma [here] (http://fightforjustice.info/?page_id=3136&amp;lang=en).\n\nThe Comfort Women by C.

What is genuinely a neat archaeological find is sensationalized by making it seem as though scholars really believe the orichalcum found came from Atlantis, because Plato said it did.\n\nNevermind that even in the source article (which still has some bad history in that it suggests that a scholar writing about the Ancient Greeks discovering America may have some merit) orichalcum is stated to have existed prior to Plato's invention of Atlantis by about 300 years. This article is written as though the ingots found are archaeological evidence *of Atlantis*:\n\n&gt; When the mythical island of Atlantis famously submerged into the ocean, it took all of its orichalcum with it. The legendary cast metal was reputedly second only to gold in value. Now, a team of divers say they’ve recovered 39 blocks of orichalcum in a sixth-century shipwreck on the seafloor near Sicily, Discovery News reports. The 2,600-year-old ship, likely from Greece or somewhere in Asia Minor, was carrying the metal to Gela in southern Sicily when it was caught in a storm and sank around 300 meters (1,000 feet) from the port. \n\n&gt;\"Nothing similar has ever been found,\"Sebastiano Tusa of Sicily's Sea Office says. \"We knew orichalcum from ancient texts and a few ornamental objects.\" According to Plato’s Critias,the metal was mined only on Atlantis, where it was used to cover the inside of Poseidon’s temple.\n\nR5: This is badly written at best, and intentionally misleading to try to get blog hits. \"Most\" scientists and historians agree that Atlantis was a myth. Presenting an archaeological discovery of an ancient alloy as proof of Atlantis or even opening the door to it is bad history, bad science, and bad reporting.\n\nThen we get this from the source article, Discovery News http://news.discovery.com/history/archaeology/atlantis-legendary-metal-found-in-shipwreck-150106.htm\n\n&gt; While other scholars equated the mysterious metal to amber and to other copper based alloys, Mattievich believes orichalcum has its roots in the Peruvian Andes and in the Chavín civilization that developed there from 1200 B.C. to 200 B.C.\n\n&gt;According to the scholar, who claimed in his book \"Journey to the Mythological Inferno\" that the ancient Greeks had discovered America, a metallic alloy \"with fire-Iike reflections\" similar to Plato's description was found in a set of metallic jaguars of Chavin style, which turned to be made of 9 percent copper, 76 percent gold and 15 percent silver.\n\n&gt;Whatever the origins and nature of orichalcum, Tusa's team plans to excavate the shipwreck and bring to light the entire cargo.\n\nThe Ancient Greeks were not in America. Atlantis is an allegorical myth. Next they'll be saying they found some electrum near the Red Sea and it might be a sign that the King of Punt really was a gigantic snake with lapis lazuli eyebrows.\n\nEdit: Aaaand it's on /r/history \nhttp://reddit.com/r/history/comments/2rqtxj/atlantis_legendary_metal_found_in_shipwreck/\n",

        "text": "This is the third of a several part series on the myths of European conquest of the Americas. The first post, [A Handful of Adventurers Topple Empires](http://np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2qn5us/myths_of_conquest_part_one_a_handful_of/), addressed the written foundation of the conquistador mythos, the rise of Cortés as the ideal conquistador, and the disastrous ends of various *entradas* attempting to conquer North America. The second post, [Invisible Allies](http://np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2r3svv/myths_of_conquest_part_two_invisible_allies/), addressed the role of Native American armies in the underlying Triple Alliance politics that allowed the fall of Tenochtitlan to succeed. This post explores how crown policy and the reward process demanded a portrayal of conquest as complete, and conquered peoples as docile in acceptance of Spanish control. Written records, needed to justify claim to land, titles, and tax income, disguised the reality of an unfinished conquest and labeled ongoing resistance as rebellion.\n\nFor the first few entries of the series, I’ll heavily rely on Restall’s *Seven Myths of the Spanish Conquest* as a jumping off point to establish a baseline rebuttal to the most prevalent contact myths. Subsequent posts will focus more deeply on topics in my own area of research. If you have a request for a post, let me know. I can try to riddle it out, or pester other badhistorians to find the answer. Also, if you see any errors, let me know so I can fix them and learn from my mistakes.\n\nHere we go…\n\n**The Myth: Spain Controlled a People Conquered, Reduced, and Pacified**\n\n&gt; By divine will I have placed under the lordship of the King and Queen, Our Lords, an other world, thanks to which Spain, once called poor, is now the richest –Christopher Columbus (1500)\n\nThough we might not go as far as Columbus, who in 1500 pronounced the entire New World under the lordship of the Spanish crown, we inherit a popular narrative of contact that emphasizes completion of conquest. After the brave exploits of a few conquistadores, colonists and missionaries submerge Native American communities and culture, creating a peaceful, conquered people either expressly loyal to the Spanish crown too disheartened to object. The worst versions of the narrative read like an analysis of capture the flag: a conquistador topples the capital, or establishes a beachhead, and announces “Game Over!” as the native populace meekly accepts defeat and vanishes from the historical record. Even Prescott, one of the most influential U.S. historians of the nineteenth century states, “the history of the Conquest of Mexico terminates with the surrender of the capital.”\n\nHere, we’ll return briefly to the paper trail of conquest, examine how the process of claiming title over lands required local authorities to present a completed invasion, with a pacified indigenous population. Personal claims complemented the larger Spanish imperial justification of conquest as guided by divine providence, and required by papal decree. Together, these attempts to validate personal, as well as imperial expansion, established conquest as complete, interpreted resistance as rebellion, and imbued an unfinished conquest with an air of inevitable success. \n\nAs background, during the exploration and conquest of the New World the Spanish crown sold licenses to explore/conquer/rule a specific region. *Adelantados* bore the cost of mounting the hazardous expeditions into the unknown, and successful invaders would gain from the production of their land, after the crown took it’s *quinto* (a fifth of spoils and taxes). The crown benefited substantially from selling these grants. Instead of devoting prohibitively expensive military resources to control land in the New World, these contracts placed the financial burden for territorial expansion on would-be conquistadores. The crown gained potential income from new lands, and contractually held the ability to regulate extremes of conquistador behavior if they failed to comply with the terms of the contract. Punishments for abuses or failure to act in a timely manner ranged from imprisonment, to substantial fines, or revoking the original license.\n\n*Adelantados* were therefore placed under extreme pressure to maintain the resources required for a successful *entrada*, establish a permanent base of operations, find something that made the new colony immediately economically viable to recoup their losses and continue to hold crown support (hence the preoccupation with precious metals), and convince the crown the local population posed no threat to their endeavors. Lobbying between *adelantados* and the crown often took years. For example, Juan de Oñate originally submitted a license to conquer New Mexico in 1595, petitioned repeatedly to lobby for contractual fulfillment when the license was revoked in 1597, and then engaged in a prolonged legal battle from 1606-1624 for use of excessive force during the *entrada*. \n\nPresenting their lands both worthy of conquest and easily conquered emerged as common theme for *adelantados* attempting to validate their position and maintain continued royal support. The formulaic writing style stressed not only a completely conquered native population, but one willing to submit both to Spanish rule and the Catholic faith, regardless of the actual facts on the ground. Hedged in religious terminology, and with papal support that acted as a divine grant of land for Castile and Portugal, “claims of possession became synonymous with possession itself” (Restall, p.68). \n\nQueen Isabel stated, in 1501, that the vast number of inhabitants populating the New World were “subjects and vassals” and should “pay to us our tributes and rights”. You read that right. Nine years after Columbus landed, and before anyone had any idea the vastness of the Americas, all inhabitants in lands claimed by Spain were subjects of the crown, they just didn’t know it yet. [Check out a translated version of the official *Requerimiento* [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Requerimiento#Requerimiento_translation). I’ll explain a little more about the *Requerimiento* in the next post]. Couched in these terms, Native American resistance to conquest became an unholy rebellion, and violent resistance an illegal infringement on colonial peace. Since conquistadores were fighting rebels against the crown and the Catholic faith, military campaigns were undertaken for pacification (not conquest). Since resistance leaders were rebels they could be tried and executed for treason, their followers legally enslaved for rebellion (despite the official ban on native slavery within the empire). I’ll quote Restall here because I can’t put it better…\n\n&gt; This pattern can be seen in the Yucatan as well as in virtually every region of Spanish America. Having founded a new colonial capital in 1542, named Mérida, the Spaniards in Yucatan declared the Conquest achieved and set about “pacifying” the peninsula. But as they controlled only a small corner of it, they were obliged to engage in major military hostilities with one Maya group after another, encountering particularly strong resistance in the northeast in the late 1540s. This was clearly an episode in a conquest war now in its third decade, but just as the Spaniards had already declared the Conquest complete so did they now classify this resistance as a rebellion… This was used to justify the execution of captives, the use of display violence (notably the hanging of women), and the enslaving of 2,000 Mayas of the region. Four centuries later, historians were still calling this “The Great Maya Revolt.” (p. 69)\n\nThe myth of a completed conquest protected *adelantados* from a revoked license, while simultaneously allowing them the legal use of increased force to subdue rebellion. Little wonder conquest narratives adopt an air of inevitability to the process of conquest. *Adelantados*, local officials, and the greater empire hoped and prayed their military endeavors would succeed. Until they established complete control over lands granted to them by the crown, the rules of the empire rewarded those who maintained the fiction of an uncomplicated, completed conquest. If we inherit an inevitable narrative of conquest it is only because, in hindsight, we read the hopes of *adelantados* as truth.\n\n**The Reality: Slowly Growing Spanish Influence in a Land of Rebellion, Revolt, and Resistance**\n\n&gt; But many kingdoms and provinces were not totally or entirely conquered, and there were left among other provinces and kingdoms great portions of them unconquered, unreduced, unpacified, some of them not even yet discovered. – Juan de Villagutierre Soto-Mayor (1701)\n\nNow that we’ve established the basis for our popular perspective of a completed, inevitable conquest, let’s highlight well-known conflicts to illustrate the protracted nature of conquest. Here I will briefly address some of the better known rebellions to show the temporal and geographic spread of resistance percolating throughout the empire despite official claims to completion. **This is, by no means, an exhaustive list**. Other Native Americans scholars, feel free to add further examples and expand on the discussion of rebellion/revolt in your areas of interest. Please see /u/AlotOfReading’s recent post on [the Apache](http://np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2rfnh9/apaches_were_famously_sweet_and_doting_parents/) for more information on that group specifically.\n\n* The popular narrative states the Inca Empire fell in 1532 with Atahuallpa’s capture and execution. Some may argue a later completion date when troops loyal to the Inca lifted the siege of Cuzco in 1536. After these setbacks, the Inca established an independent state until the final Inca, Túpac Amaru, was executed in 1572. Instead of rapid conquest won by the great conquistador Pizarro, that is nearly four decades of fighting. Even after Túpac Amaru’s death, large portions of Tawantinsusyu remained well outside Spanish control and continued to violently oppose Spanish encroachment.\n\n* As previously mentioned, the capital of Mérida was established in the Yucatan in 1542, and officially the conquest of the Maya claimed. However, independent polities abounded on the peninsula. Both military conquest, and peaceful Franciscan attempts to incorporate the independent kingdoms, failed. Petén remained independent, and accepted refugees fleeing from Spanish controlled areas. The last independent kingdom, Itza, finally fell in 1697, a century and a half after Spaniards raised the “Mission Accomplished” banner in Mérida. Resistance continued. In 1847 the Yucatan Maya pushed the colonial frontier back to the sixteenth-century limits, and some regions maintained independence into the early twentieth century.\n\n* The Chichimeca War pitted Spanish expansion against the [Chichimeca confederacy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chichimeca_War#mediaviewer/File:Chichimeca_Nations.png) only eight years after Spain failed to completely extinguish the Mixtón Rebellion. For four decades the Chichimeca attacked neighboring Native Americans allied to the Spanish, as well as caravans in and out of the vitally important mining towns of Zacatecas. Between 1550 and 1600 the conflict cost more Spanish lives than any previous military conflict in Mexico (Altman et al., 2003). The futility of military maneuvers against the guerilla tactics used by the Chichimeca required a shift in Spanish methods of conquest. New policies emphasized both the use of missions to establish peaceful trade, as well as the relocation of staunchly loyal Native American allies (in this case our old friends the Tlaxcalan) to both act as buffers to the violence and lead the Chichimeca to docility by example.\n\n* After ninety years of near-constant tension since Oñate’s *entrada*, the Spanish frontier in New Mexico collapsed in 1680. The Pueblo Revolt ousted the Spanish from New Mexico for twelve years, and jeopardized the entire northern frontier of the empire during a time when the Spanish feared growing French and English encroachment. Diego de Vargas led a “bloodless” reconquest in 1692, but the nature of subsequent Native American-Spanish relationships in New Mexico changed to reflect the constant negotiation and re-negotiation required to maintain an isolated frontier on the edge of a vast empire. \n\n* The Yaqui Wars, started by Spain, and inherited by Mexico, were a source of constant conflict from the late 1600s until 1929. Along with the end of the Caste War against the Maya, the termination of the Yaqui Wars marked the last of centuries of conflict that ranged from the Sonoran desert to the highlands bordering Guatemala, commonly wrapped together under the inclusive title of “Mexican Indian Wars”. The United States likewise inherited a war of incomplete conquest with the acquisition of Spanish Florida. As the Seminole remind us, some nations never surrendered despite repeated claims of completion.\n\n*Wrapping Up*\n\nThe myth of the completion of conquest relies on an uncritical examination of the primary sources, as well as a denial of the constant tensions underlying Spanish control throughout the Americas. Instead of one initial battle led by the conquistadores of legend, this view of conquest shows how near constant armed expeditions and military actions were required to both expand the borders, and maintain control, of a geographically widespread and ethnically diverse empire. Though we tend to view these conflicts as isolated revolts or rebellions, they represent the extension of the fight for conquest that existed throughout the Spanish Empire in the Americas.\n\nNative American populations used a variety of methods to oppose conquest. Here we highlighted the armed conflicts, but further posts will show how, for many Native Americans, the Spanish presence was a protracted invasion. Opposition to such an invasion required a mixed response of accommodation and resistance, as well as everyday methods of maintaining the autonomy, both legal and illegally. \n\nMore myths of conquest to come. Stay tuned.\n\nAltman, Cline, and Pescador (2003) *The Early History of Greater Mexico*\n\nRestall (2003) *Seven Myths of the Spanish Conquest*",

        "text": "Answer: [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tikMKR3rzw).\n\nI'm neither a modern historian, nor old enough to remember the 1950s, so I'm not going to comment on the historicity of either of the \"true\" bras. The corset which they begin with, though is... well, it's not anything like a corset from the 1500s, I'll tell you that for nothing.\n\nThe corset in the video is of modern design, and so is probably acrylic boned, though it's possible that it's steel boned. What is immediately obvious in the video is that the corset is fastened at the front with hooks and eyes, which is very definitely not what an Elizabethan-era or before corset would have looked like. 16th Century corsets looked rather more [like this](http://www.elizabethancostume.net/corsets/images/pfaltzcors.gif).\n\nThe key points to notice are that there is a line down the center of the front of the corset, not for hooks and eyes, but for a \"busk\", that is, a long straight piece of wood or whalebone, which would either be sewn to the corset or in a sort of pocket, so that it was removable, which would give the corset its characteristic stiffness and shape. Also, note the extremely long front compared to the sides -- contrast with the shape of the modern fashion corset ([this](http://www.corset-story.com/waist-training-corset-in-silver-black-brocade-wt-194.html) is fairly similar to the corset in the video).\n\nThe third major difference is the neckline: the modern corset, both in the video and the link, have a sweetheart neckline (that's the double curve which resembles the top part of a heart shape, for those who don't know), and are strapless. By contrast, the 16th century corset has shoulder straps and a square cut neckline, to match the fashionable cut for women's dresses at the time.\n\n(Even had the corset been period accurate, by the way, the video wouldn't have been that helpful. All the women look to be wearing precisely the same corset, despite the fact that they are clearly not all the same size, and it only really fits one of them anywhere close to correctly. She's the one who says that she'd wear it all day. The woman at 00:46 (\"it's just kind of hanging out in front of my breasts\") clearly gets no support whatsoever from it -- the last time I saw a corset so badly fitting on the bust, I was dressed as Dr Frank-N-Furter from the Rocky Horror Show, having borrowed my friend's corset. She has relatively large breasts for her frame; I am male and skinny as fuck. There's a little implicit badhistory here, as well: 16th Century corsets were for the wealthy, who could have afforded properly fitting clothing...)\n\nThen, the comments happen. \n\n&gt;  Yeah, real Corsets are supposed to be so tight your boobs are squished against your chest to the point where it's a little painful.﻿\n\nYeah, no. That's completely wrong in every possible way. It is the case that at some times in history, corsets have been designed to constrict the waist (not the bust), but that wasn't really the case in the 16th century, and nor is it the case today, the era the corset they show is from.\n\n&gt; [Ye Olde Timey Corsetry] could lead to death, severe breathing difficulties, deformed organs/bones, broken bones (which can still happen if you wear a modern corset to tight), lack of circulation, difficulties with eating/keeping food down, often caused fainting and some dyes used could poison the person. \n\nFortunately, another of the commenters who seems to know what they are talking about corrects this, so I'll just quote that:\n\n&gt;   While some of the problems you mention like breathing difficulties, circulation problems, and changes in eating habits are possible (usually as the result of a badly fitted corset), broken bones and deformed organs are myths. A Victorian corset, which the modern fashion corset they tried on was based off of, is no more dangerous than a modern corset. I'm a historical costumer and there are plenty of ladies who use the exact same patterns and fabrics they used \"back in the day\" and wear them without incident. None of them has ever been killed by their corset. You are right about the dyes, though. Many contained lead and arsenic. The majority of corsets, however, were white (undyed) and worn over a chemise, which would protect the skin from absorbing chemicals. Even the Victorians were aware that their dyes were deadly. Also, outside of fashion models and actresses (who, much like modern models and celebrities, were held to more strenuous body standards), women weren't expected to wear corsets as tight as possible. The opposite was true: women were actually told to avoid tightlacing and were frowned upon for doing so. Indeed, many of the corset myths floating around today are rooted in Victorian propaganda against extreme tightlacing practices.﻿\n\nOh, and one more fun comment, before I give up:\n\n&gt; Didn't they used to crack ribs to fit into corsets to look skinnier?﻿\n\nI am almost 100% certain that this is a myth.",

        "text": "While browsing [r/Anarcho_Capitalism](http://np.reddit.com/r/Anarcho_Capitalism/) in a temporary fit of insanity, I discovered a discussion of one of the most misunderstood and ethically ambiguous periods of American history. I am of course talking about the Apache wars. These conflicts crossed all racial, territorial, and ethnic lines and at times involved more than two dozen separate sides, each working to their own ends. Unfortunately, the nuances of these centuries spanning conflicts have escaped our [dear author](http://np.reddit.com/comments/2r3sdw/). The purpose of this post is not to diminish the crimes committed by any side, but to highlight the historical context surrounding the fall of the Apache. \n\n&gt; *This according to Dan Carlin, voice of Hardcore History.\n&gt; They simply had a culture of outward violence that preyed upon others for a living. They were a warrior culture and directed their aggression outwards without reservation.*\n\nFor all that you can speak of the Apache as a unified group, they were unquestionably archetypes of warrior culture. General Nelson Miles had this to say in an 1886 [report](http://lcweb2.loc.gov/service/gdc/scd0001/1998/19981208001cr/19981208001cr.pdf):\n\n&gt; The Chiricahuas were the wildest and fiercest Indians on the continent, savage and brutual by instinct, they hesitated no more at taking human life when excited by passion than in killing a rabbit.\n\nThis was not an uncommon view at the time. The Apache had written a trail of blood across the Southwest for more than a century. Settlers demanded Geronimo's men hang from the gallows, Northern Mexico was recovering from the loss of more than 70% of its population, and the President himself was watching the Indian wars closely. Fortunately, we have more sources than one officer.\n\nGeneral Crook was notoriously sympathetic to the Apache before he was replaced by Miles. The Tombstone weekly epitaph, notoriously anti-Crook, had this to say of Crook in on pg. 3 of their 11-11-1882:\n\n&gt; Gen. Crook told them that so long as they behaved he would be their best friend. He wanted them to set to work gaining their own livelihood, so as not to be dependent on the bounty on the Government and to assist him in bringing in to the reservation every Apache on the warpath.\n\nCharles Lummis, reporter on the final days of the Indian wars and Crook-supporter, reported this:\n\n&gt; You observe that Crook goes by the assumption that the Apache is a human being, after all. That's one of the reasons Arizona is down on him.\n\n\nOur favourite author is not quite done with his diatribe against the Apache though.\n\n&gt; *A loving family life didn't stop the Apache from being the worst sort of murderers, killing even women and children indiscriminately, and being inventive torturers, they created the torturous death by low fire, used to hang children on meat hooks, mutilate bodies with hundreds of knife wounds.*\n\nI am doubly disappointed here. Firstly, is that he forgot my [least?] favourite torture the Apache were accused of: leaving men on anthills with sweet nectar or honey. The screams could reportedly be heard for days. The meat hook story is similarly gruesome, but I have only ever heard of it happening once, to a girl near Silver city massacred with her family. Secondly, it is worth noting that the Apache are a diverse people. Those on the reservations were not much different from other tribes at the time in terms of peacefulness. Those on the warpath were brutal to a degree we'd find shocking today. However, we cannot understand the brutality of the last Indian wars without looking at their origins in the Spanish conquest. Unlike their successes in the South, Spanish had difficulty navigating the complex political landscape of Northern Mexico, especially in the wake of the Columbian plagues. The Spanish responded harshly and wantonly to Apache raiding of settlements. Their enslavement of Apache led to brutal slaughters on both sides. Tensions escalated with the inability of the Spanish to stop Apache raids. The costs of raiding, depopulation, and military action the Spanish devastated Northern Mexico. In turn, Spanish plagues wrecked havoc with the ability of the Apache to conduct raids against the Spanish at all. With the decline of the Spanish Empire and the Apache population, a de facto truce had taken hold by 1800. In 1821, the Mexican war of Independence succeeded and the new government took over Apache policy. The expensive Spanish policies to keep Apaches appeased were quickly repealed, causing tensions to flare. In response to renewed raiding, the Northern States of Mexico began to respond with military force. The Apache quickly adapted their strategies. A raiding group would attack a village and lay a trap for the military response, who were often the actual target. It was evident by 1825 that the military was ill-equipped to deal with Apache raiders. The Sonoran government enacted a policy to pay per head for Apaches; $25 for children, $50 for women, and $100 for warriors. American bounty hunters flooded into Mexico. Realizing the Apache warriors were difficult targets, they began attacking Mexican and Apache villages, passing the scalps off as adult warriors. It was against this turbulent backdrop of blood, war, and genocide that these atrocities were committed.\n \n&gt; \\&gt; *Which native American tribes were the most peaceful?*\n&gt; [*Probably the ones that lived by trade and agriculture, rather than the warrior-loot culture the Apaches had going on. Razing was a way of life for them, something they considered fun and lucrative, for generations. They'd been doing it long before the Spanish and the rest showed up, only preying upon other native tribes then. =*](http://np.reddit.com/r/Anarcho_Capitalism/comments/2r3sdw/contramolyneux_apaches_were_famously_sweet_and/cncfp44)\n \nThe Apache were new to the area by the time the Spanish appeared and a minor feature in the ethnic landscape. The Chiricahua bands numbered no more than 3,000 people before the Columbian Exchange. In comparison, the Tohono O'Odham could claim perhaps as many as 50,000 people, declining to 10% of that number by the time Father Kino arrived. Apachean groups were generally isolated from the early plagues. It was only with the precipitous decline of their neighbours that they grew to dominate their slice of the Southwest.\n\n&gt; *Pretty much all of the tribes had warpaths that they would from time to time go on, as much a matter of defense, offense, and revenge.\nAnd their method of warfare wasn't scorched-earth like ours. They'd take people slaves rather than kill whole villages, then induct them into the tribe in time, marry them, etc. They learned scorched-earth tactics largely from Westerners.*\n\nI'm unsure how to reconcile this with the destruction of [Awatovii](http://www.santafenewmexican.com/news/trail_dust/trail-dust-massacre-at-awatovi-is-little-known-act-of/article_7231e60b-9897-50bc-992d-8d5344685d4c.html). It was in essence the complete decimation of a village. The men were burned alive, with only two being spared. Those women and children spared from the massacre were forced to abandon the site and absorbed into neighbouring villages. Secondly, and this is really the more important point, the Apache did not practice scorched earth tactics. \n\n\n&gt; *One particularly striking account was of a tribe living so hand to mouth that they moved seasonally between edible crops for months at a time. This root for three months during that season, then over here for cactus fruit (his favorite) to fatten up before it rotted and fell off, and then over there for this seagrass for two months, etc.*\n\nIt should be noted that this is in fact how all hunter-gatherers live. Some areas of the Southwest are simply unsuitable for agriculture, particularly those inhabited by the Hia C-ed O'odham (along the northern edge of the Gulf of California)\n\n&gt; [*I don't know what \"sweet and doting\" means, but if you learn true empathy as a child then it's very very hard for you to just go out and indiscriminately slaughter others when you come of age. It sounds more to me like they were just raised by psychopaths who knew how to practice a light tough with their own kind.*](http://np.reddit.com/r/Anarcho_Capitalism/comments/2r3sdw/contramolyneux_apaches_were_famously_sweet_and/cnc9b3v)\n\nPeople have written whole books on the Apache and their famous stolidity. As a readable introduction, I recommend the article [*\"To Give up on Words\": Silence in Western Apache Culture\"*](http://www.deerfield.k12.wi.us/faculty/petersenr/To%20Give%20Up%20Words.pdf). Apachean people were not all psychopaths, but they had a very different culture than most westerners at the time. As I have mentioned several times, they were also not inhumane monsters. While the Apache spilled a great deal of blood, it was not indiscriminate slaughter on everyone they met. Many trappers and hunters reported a great deal on the Apache before tensions and betrayal led to mutual hostility.\n\n&gt; [*The Apache were good to Apaches and murderous to non-Apaches. Culturally, empathy for outsiders was foreign to them.\n&gt; The Apache ritual for coming of age required a young person to go on four raids, involving murder, torture, theft. That's how they lived, by violent raiding of others.*](http://np.reddit.com/r/Anarcho_Capitalism/comments/2r3sdw/contramolyneux_apaches_were_famously_sweet_and/cnc9kks)\n\nRaiding as a coming-of-age was in fact a specific institution of the Chiricahua Apache. It was not shared by all Apache. Even among the Chiricahua, the first trip or two (for they weren't necessarily raids) was simply to observe and test the child. Participation was reserved for those who had proven their abilities. \n\nThe Apache were not universally hostile to outsiders either, but there were many cases of mistaken identity. One such incident occurred in 1825 along the Gila river. The Apache mistook a party of trappers for Spanish and attacked them. The trappers pushed the Apache back without fatalities, but lost their fur catch. A year later, one trapper returned to get his skins. The Apache paid him 150 skins and a horse in apology. \nIn general, before the rise of hostilities with Americans after the Mexican-American war, many trappers considered the Apache friendly. When they were in need, the Apache would give food and shelter. In turn, the Apache regularly traded for weapons and spare horses.\n\nThis final link speaks for itself\n\n&gt; [*I'd also like to point out that Apaches probably did not practice the teaching of scientific thinking through reason and evidence. I highly doubt they even had developed that kind of advanced reasoning by the time whites showed up*](http://np.reddit.com/r/Anarcho_Capitalism/comments/2r3sdw/contramolyneux_apaches_were_famously_sweet_and/cnclky0)\n\n\nThe Apache were not inhuman monsters, savagely spilling blood to sate animal desires. They were loosely affiliated people of a different culture fighting to maintain their independence in a turbulent new world. While we cannot forget atrocities committed by the Apaches, we must be mindful of their context. Behind the Apache lay a trail of western betrayal, disease, enslavement, and death. Some went quietly, some fought to the last. To pass judgement on their actions suggests a moral high ground I'm not certain exists amidst the genocide and bloodshed of the last of the Indian wars.\n\nCharles Lummis sums it up well: \n\n    The Desert's mighty Silence;\n    no fuss of man can spill\n    A hundred Indians whoop and sing,\n    And still the Land is still;\n    But on the city drunk with sound\n    the whisper is a shout --\n    'Apaches on the war-path!\n    Geronimo is out!'\n\n    Brave rode our wiry troopers --\n    they rode without avail;\n    Their chase he tweaked it by the nose,\n    and twisted by the tail;\n    Around them and around he rode --\n    A pack-train putters slow,\n    And 'horse and man of ours must eat' --\n    'Ahnh!' said Geronimo.\n\n    They never say a hair of him,\n    but ever and oft they felt --\n    Each rock and cactus spitting lead\n    from an Apache belt,\n    Where never sign of man there was,\n    nor flicker of a gun --\n    You cannot fight an empty hill;\n    you run -- if left to run!\n\n    A prophet of his people, he,\n    no War-Chief, but their Priest,\n    And strong he made his Medicine,\n    and deep the mark he creased --\n    The most consummate Warrior\n    since warfare first began,\n    The deadliest Fighting Handful\n    in the calendar of Man.\n    \n    The Desert Empire that he rode,\n\this trail of blood and fire,\n\tIs pythoned, springs and valleys, with\n\tthe strangle-snake of wire.\n\tThe Fence has killed the Range and all\n\tfor which its freedom stood--\n\tThough countless footsore cowboys mill\n\tin mimic Hollywood\n\t\n\tA Tragedy?

        "text": "After waiting for two sets of moratoriums to go by to be able to post this, it's time to share a post about our old favorite joke and dead horse, the old myth about the \"Christian Dark Ages\" and science. This time, a popular internet cartoon does a joke that dregs up believers in the \"Christian Dark Ages = bad for science\" camp.     \n      \nIn [Episode 3 of the Cyanide &amp; Happiness Show \"Grandpa's War Stories,\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89qx4DO1aWM), there is a sketch about a scientist trying to build a transporter, but accidentally builds a time machine.  As a result, various items get transported about 50,000 years into the past to a caveman who benefits from them. At one point (about 4:00 on the clip), the scientist gets so frustrated that he throws books into the time machine. They are all science books, and as each book is thrown in, the city behind the scientist is altered to look more and more advanced (suggesting the knowledge is being used and advancing civilization). But, the last book he throws in is the Holy Christian Bible.  At that point, the city reverts back to it's normal self and all advances are lost.      \nIt's a joke of course by the show.  If you're a regular reader of r/badhistory, you can practically predict what will happen when he throws the bible in there (since many others have done similar types of jokes).  Also, it's not like they were creating a reality-based science fiction thing with this. After all, it's never explained (among other things) when the ability to process language and literacy came about for this caveman. It's supposed to be a joke, but...just go down to the comments section.      \n      \nWhile plenty complain about Christians commenting about being offended at this joke, what about the bad history being passed around?      \n      \nHere are some highlights from the first day of commenting:\nFrom commenter \"magicscreenman\":      \n      \n&gt;The Bible is also responsible for spawning the Catholic Church, which is the entity responsible for burning Giordano Bruno at the stake. His crime? Believing that the universe was infinite, and that the Earth was not the center of it all. He preached this belief openly to any who would listen, until the Church threw him in prison for decades, found him guilty of treason, and then burned him alive. Ironically enough, Bruno's grand visions of the universe inspired generations of scientists who would come after him, and ended up proving his visions and beliefs to be true through discovery, objective data, and fact. The privilege of greatly advancing our societies and species goes exclusively to science. No religion can claim to have done in thousands of years what science has done in a mere centuries.       \n      \nFrom commenter \"Sifenchar\":\n        \n&gt;Christianity is not an advancement. It's a setback. Termination of the persuit of knowledge, the Jihads, homosexual persecution, the Dark Ages, the Crusades, the holocaust, 9/11, war over Jerusalem, religious segregation, supremacy conflicts, and Rick Perry to name a few examples﻿      \n      \nLet's stick with 3 examples for now and end with commenter, \"religion is wrong\":      \n      \n&gt;Religion halted scientific progress in the dark ages. When he threw the science books in the time machine, you notice that the buildings in the window get more advanced. However, when he threw the bible in there, everything reverted to normal. Get it?      \n      \nWe've all heard similar arguments before and, for the R5, they have refuted again and again that Christianity is responsible for a decline in scientific advancement in the time between the fall of the Roman Empire and the Early Modern period. The concept of the Catholic Church colluded to stop all scientific advancement has not been established as fact.  The opposite has been argued and proven, that Christianity helped advance science.  Some scientists found assistance from Christendom, and scientific knowledge got preserved because of some Christian record keepers.  Also, it's been discussed how the concept of measuring the advancement of science is difficult to do. For more on this, see [Zaldax's post about \"Bad History of Christianity Part 3](http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/1vcffo/badhistory_of_christianity_part_3_the_christian/), and [smileyman's post about medieval scientific advancements](http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/1pxjia/a_til_about_erastosthenes_provokes_some/).      \n      \nSo remember folks, \"Christian Dark Ages\" will probably never die, but we can at least try and laugh at the idea of this concept repeating itself again and again.      \n      \n------\n      \nEDIT 24 HOURS LATER: I decided to go look through comments again on that video and see if any other gems came up. Pretty much just a bunch of comments that, if taking 10 of them to be representative, would break down into: 1 post complaining about bible joke, 6 posts complaining about people complaining about bible joke, 1 post complaining about not liking that video series' new style, and 2 posts for other types of posts.      \n      \nBut I did find this from a week ago that actually tried to talk about history, but I suspect it's bad history too (if I could completely understand what they are trying to say):      \n      \nSaid by poster \"XnonStudios\"      \n     \n&gt;i dont know what reference it was about throwing the bible in and stopping progress. but just to let you all know. if it wasnt for the church . we would be in 500+ years of technological advances. yes 500+years. the church took over during a period of time shunning all that proved otherwise against the bible. no it wasnt that people were not advanced to even have those thoughts. it really was the church shunning brights minds into prison or execution for displaying knowledge against the bible. for 500 years. i mean i dont want to offend anyone. but i think it was a reference to that point in history      \n         \nHe got into a small conversation and eventually posted this too:      \n      \n&gt;the reason why i think we would have made it further. is because scientific discoveries started to show up. people started to question things. the church soon got down to the bottom of it. never question the advances that could have been made back then. a monk found out and wrote a whole book and calculus thousands of years ago. if we would have found it a long time ago. say like 200 years ago. we would have far more advances that we would have today. now that was a monk. but before the church took their control, hundreds of people started to question thins. if they would have left them alone. they would have began to think about things that no one would have thought before. sure someone would have gained control, but that was a religion. they say you must think and do in certain ways. when thats gone. those are free. the church at that time even took control of the theater. something would have taken control, but would could it possibly be more powerful than the church? rebels, no, people, maybe....no one. they brainwashed. told you to think and do certain ways, and killed anyone who thought other wise. we may not have been in 500 years in the future, but we definitely would have been somewhere with more advances ﻿      \n      \nAnother person posted this response to the original guy named Kawa Zizou:      \n     \n&gt;If the Roman Empire never fell, the world would be more advanced, and Europe would have never fell into the dark ages. Christianity began to spread near the Empire's demise. That's really saying something. Also, European popes, kings and queens, held back scientific progress that went against what the bible said. Christianity threw the world behind and that is a fact, the world is only where it is now because of how the Muslims promoted the study of sciences, and influenced the rennaisance by the study and analyzation of old Roman texts.﻿      \n      \nI'm a early modern historian, this is getting a bit beyond me. Could anyone explain to me what they are trying to say and what the actual history is?",

        "text": "Apparently discovery of the New World \"ruptured Europe's religious uniformity\" and \"contributed to the Protestant Reformation\", as per OP's book: http://i.imgur.com/Xiet9Aw.jpg\n\nThis is obviously false. The causes of Protestant Reformation - corruption of the Catholic Church, religious tensions in Europe after Great Western Schism, hussite wars and Council of Constance, decline of papal authority, increasing literacy and easier access to written sources thanks to printing press, policy of rulers who were either pro-Catholic (like Emperor of HRE) or anti-Catholic (like Henry VIII) for various reasons and all this is to name just a few in a great simplification - had nothing to do with discovery of the New World.\n\nOn the other hand, the discovery of \"aliens in America\" did influence Catholic dogma and what's particularly interesting is how the Europeans approached \"Indians\". Are they fully humans or just savages? Can they be saved by Jesus? Do they have soul? These and other questions remained important for a long time, leading for example to Valladolid debate:\n\n&gt; **The Valladolid debate (1550–1551) concerned the treatment of natives of the New World.** Held in the Colegio de San Gregorio, in the Spanish city of Valladolid, it consisted of two opposing views about the colonization of the Americas. Dominican friar and Bishop of Chiapas Bartolomé de las Casas argued that the Amerindians were free men in the natural order and deserved the same treatment as others, according to Catholic theology.Opposing him was humanist scholar Juan Ginés de Sepúlveda, who insisted that \"in order to uproot crimes that offend nature\" the Indians should be punished and therefore reducing them to slavery or serfdom was in accordance with Catholic theology and natural law\n\n**Source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valladolid_debate**\n\nWhat's even more interesting is how the papacy reacted to the abuse of Indians by Spanish and Portugeese colonists/conquistadors. And the answer was pretty firm - in 1537 a papal bull \"Sublimus Dei\" was promulgated by pope Paul III in which he stated:\n\n&gt; The enemy of the human race, who opposes all good deeds in order to bring men to destruction, beholding and envying this, invented a means never before heard of, by which he might hinder the preaching of God's word of Salvation to the people: he inspired his satellites who, to please him, have not hesitated to publish abroad that the Indians of the West and the South, and other people of whom We have recent knowledge should be treated as dumb brutes created for our service, pretending that they are incapable of receiving the Catholic Faith.\n\n&gt;We, who, though unworthy, exercise on earth the power of our Lord and seek with all our might to bring those sheep of His flock who are outside into the fold committed to our charge, consider, however, that **the Indians are truly men and that they are not only capable of understanding the Catholic Faith but, according to our information, they desire exceedingly to receive it.** Desiring to provide ample remedy for these evils, We define and declare by these Our letters, or by any translation thereof signed by any notary public and sealed with the seal of any ecclesiastical dignitary, to which the same credit shall be given as to the originals, that, notwithstanding whatever may have been or may be said to the contrary, **the said Indians and all other people who may later be discovered by Christians, are by no means to be deprived of their liberty or the possession of their property, even though they be outside the faith of Jesus Christ**; and that they may and should, freely and legitimately, enjoy their liberty and the possession of their property; **nor should they be in any way enslaved; should the contrary happen, it shall be null and have no effect.**\n\n**Source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sublimus_Dei**\n\nTo sum it up: baseless (or at least very badly argumented) claim concerning history gets more than 2500 upvotes, the false premise is ignored.\n\nEDIT: **Link to the thread - http://np.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/2rali1/til_european_christians_freaked_out_when_columbus/**",

        "text": "As every 4X player will tell you, specialize or die. You can build your cities to be jack-of-all-trades, but they will be masters of none. The best strategy is usually to create a focus for each of your cities: a city focused purely on science, another spitting out military units on each turn, and so on...\n\nThe ancient Greeks, fathers of ~~European~~ ~~Western~~ ~~the best~~ all civilization, understood that better than anyone else. That's why each City-State had a single focus. Delphi produced piety, Athens culture, Syracuse beakers, Lesbos bad jokes to make 15-years-old giggle, and Sparta, obviously, produced Greece's military units. At least, that's the way it worked according to [r/worldnews](http://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews).\n\n&gt; [Think about why some countries specialize in certain services, the same way ancient Greeks relied on the Spartans for military services.](http://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2r8ws0/merkel_prepared_to_let_greece_exit_eurozone_report/cndp29i)\n\nOnly problem with this vision of ancient Greece? Greece didn't rely on the Spartans for military service at all. Greece was a place made up of rival city-states who spent much of their time fighting each others and only really united in one circumstance: when a bigger city state subjugated them. Usually, when that happened, two things happened: the tributary cities payed tribute to the stronger one, and more importantly, gave them troops. \n\nSparta was no exception: in every war they waged, they used not only their own troops, but also those of their tributary cities. At the start of the Peloponnesian war, according to Thucydides,\n\n&gt; Ships were furnished by the Corinthians, Megarians, Sicyonians, Pellenians, Eleans, Ambraciots, and Lecadians; and cavalry by the Boeotians, Phocians and Locrians. The other states [of the Lacedaemonian Confederacy] sent infantry.\n\nand\n\n&gt; Lacedaemon [aka Sparta] sent round orders to the cities in Peloponnese and the rest of her confederacy to prepare troops and the provisions requisite for a foreign campaign, in order to invade Attica [...] the contingent of each city being two-thirds of its whole force.\n\nSo, yeah, not only was Spartan relying heavily on its tributaries' troops for its military, but during that war, who was the enemy? Well, as it turns out, the Peleponnesian war opposed two Greek confederations, one led by Sparta, and the other by Athens. Seeing how they were busy waging an all-out war against Sparta, I don't really see how Athens, which were the epitome of \"ancient Greeks\" could rely on Sparta for military service.\n\nEven if we take into account wars were the Greeks were more or less united against a foreign enemy, Sparta, despite having an important place in Greece's army, were hardly the only ones fighting. During the battle of Thermopylae, the 300 Spartans were fighting alongside 700 Thespians and 400 Thebans. During Alexander's conquests, when all of Greece marched against Persia, Spartans stayed home.\n\nI apologize for any mistake I might have made: English isn't my first language and all I know of Classical Greece I learned by watching Troy, so don't hesitate to correct me. I also haven't played much Civilization in a long time, so if any Civ player took offense to that first sentence, I will only say that Endless Legends is much better anyway, you scrub.\n\nEdit: Missed a np. link",

First, the whole thing:\n\n&gt;Do not be quite so quick to toot Julius Caesar's flute .. despite his military prowess he was a plunderer and a butcher, who relied on Khazar horse breeders to provide remounts for his cavalry units.\n\n&gt;He laid siege to a city located near Grenoble is in present day France, that was filled with refugees who had fled the depredations his legions wrought in the countryside, where after their surrender..\n\n&gt;He took those he wanted, then sold the remainder of the entire population to a Jewish slave trader for fifteen million sesterces, the Roman unit of currency .. he was an aficionado of gladiatorial combat and kept a stable of gladiators.\n\n&gt;He brought his Gallic legions into Italy in 49 BC, in defiance of a Roman Law prohibiting regular troops from exercising on the mainland, which precipitated Civil War.\n\n&gt;Whereupon his former son in law, the great Roman hero Gnaeus Pompey commanded the Republican forces, where after their defeat at the Battle of Pharsalus in 48 BC, Caesar had him and his sons hunted down and killed!\n\n&gt;After Caesar's murder in 44 BC, plotted by his arch nemesis Marcus Tullius Cicero who he had twice pardoned on capital charges, who was in the thrall of his alleged homosexual paramour one Atticus, a wealthy publisher and industrialist who was despite his Greek name a Jew!\n\n&gt;Marc Antony as Caesar's Master of Horse and thus Second in Command of his legions, levied brutal retaliation against C's killers including Cicero, where after another round of conquest and Civil War he committed suicide .. Jews were in command.\n\nOy.  Now, there's delightful badhistory in every bit, so to take it apart (skipping the bits about the Roman military, cuz I don't know about that stuff):\n\n&gt;Do not be quite so quick to toot Julius Caesar's flute .. despite his military prowess he was a plunderer and a butcher, who relied on Khazar horse breeders to provide remounts for his cavalry units.\n\nI can't speak to the Roman military aspect, but the Khazars did not really exist for several hundred years after Julius Caesar.  This is like saying that the Soviets served as mercenaries in the Hundred Years War--the timescale is so bad it defies comprehension.  Also I'm unaware of the Khazars being noted horse breeders, but at this point they might as well have sold Caesar tanks.\n\n&gt;He took those he wanted, then sold the remainder of the entire population to a Jewish slave trader for fifteen million sesterces, the Roman unit of currency .. he was an aficionado of gladiatorial combat and kept a stable of gladiators.\n\nA Jewish slave trader?  Buying some massive slave population?  We know precious little in hard documentary sources about Jewish life in Rome.  I'm pretty sure there were no slave tycoons (I just thought of a horrific video game...) who were Jewish in ancient Rome.  But if such a thing has escaped my knowledge, I can't really google it now, can I.  If this were true it might have made some Romans write more about Jews, which would be helpful.  But it isn't.\n\n&gt;After Caesar's murder in 44 BC, plotted by his arch nemesis Marcus Tullius Cicero who he had twice pardoned on capital charges, who was in the thrall of his alleged homosexual paramour one Atticus, a wealthy publisher and industrialist who was despite his Greek name a Jew!\n\nHaving a Greek name doesn't make one not Jewish--loads of Jews during this time adopted Greek names.  While Atticus did own a lot of copyist-slaves, it's not really a publisher in the modern sense.  The notion of an ancient Roman industrialist is amusing, and is not the first massive continuity error.  Also, Atticus was clearly not Jewish.\n\n&gt;Marc Antony as Caesar's Master of Horse and thus Second in Command of his legions, levied brutal retaliation against C's killers including Cicero, where after another round of conquest and Civil War he committed suicide .. Jews were in command.\n\nJews, a virtually nonexistent minority in Rome at this point, were in command?  At this point (no Roman-Jewish wars to create a large population of enslaved Jews, no economic collapse in Judea to drive people out, Rome didn't even directly control Judea at this point) there were large Jewish communities outside Judea, but mostly in the Eastern Mediterranean, particularly Alexandria.  The notion of \"the Jews\" as a coherent and relevant group in 1st century BCE Rome is preposterous.",

        "text": "I am pleased to introduce the second of what I hope will be a several part series on the myths of European conquest of the Americas. The first post, [A Handful of Adventurers Topple Empires](http://np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2qn5us/myths_of_conquest_part_one_a_handful_of/), addressed the written foundation of the conquistador mythos, the rise of Cortés as the ideal conquistador, and the less than successful ends of various *entradas* attempting to conquer North America. This post on invisible allies dovetails quite nicely with /u/Ahhuatl’s [analysis of an *Economist* article](http://np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2qjnyo/should_it_mexico_accept_the_historical_record/). A recent re-reading of Restall’s *Seven Myths of the Spanish Conquest*, as well as ~~constantly reading badhistory that annoys me~~ the wish to provide something interesting to /r/badhistory users, sparked this series of posts. For the first few entries, I’ll use *Seven Myths* as a jumping off point to establish a baseline/rebuttal to the most prevalent contact myths. Subsequent posts will focus more deeply on topics in my own areas of research. If you see anything wrong/inaccurate, let me know so I can learn from my mistakes.\n\nWithout further ado, we’ll dive in…\n\n**The Myth: Cortés Conquered the Aztec Empire**\n\nThis myth is closely linked to the “Handful of Adventurers” narrative, which holds Europeans were so stinking awesome that it only took a few white guys armed with steel weapons, firearms, horses, and a smattering of bad pathogens to take down the largest empires in the Americas. In the popular perception, a dozen or a hundred Europeans wrestled control of the New World from Native Americans kept at bay by poor technology or fear of the white guy’s guns and horses. \n\nPart One of the posts in this series addressed how the rules of the conquistador game rewarded shameless self-promotion when lobbying the crown for offices, titles, and pensions. While Part One established that self-promoting embellishments often occurred at the expense of comrades, or, you know, the truth, this post examines the roll of native allies. Here, we’ll highlight how the absence of Native American allies from Spanish documents, and the popular narrative, completely misconstrues the narrative of the fall of Tenochtitlan. \n\n**The Reality: A Native American Civil War Aided by Spanish Outlaws**\n\nViewed from Tlaxcalan perspective, the small band Europeans provided the impetus to strike against the ruling Mexica while minimizing their own losses. Cortés entered a complex web of Triple Alliance political intrigue when he marched inland from Veracruz. His tendency to destroy everything and everyone he touched made him a violent and unpredictable, though potentially useful, ally. Though Cortés managed to capitalize eventually, he came close to absolute disaster at least five times before the fall of Tenochtitlan. In the end, his small force complemented a massive native army of hundreds of thousands that eventually destroyed the Triple Alliance capital.\n\nBy way of background, the Mexica allied with Texcoco and Tlacopan to form the Triple Alliance in 1430, and over the next ninety years engaged in a series of conquests that expanded their area of influence in central and southern Mexico (see [a fun map](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aztec_Empire#mediaviewer/File:Aztec_Empire_1519_map-fr.svg)!). Some city-states, like Tlaxcala, managed to maintain their independence but constantly lived in the shadow of an aggressive, expansive neighbor. Once conquered, subordinate city-states, and their elite ruling class, typically remained intact after incorporation into the empire. Local elites controlled the tribute, and were often integrated into the Triple Alliance Empire ruling class through marriage. Personal loyalty was directed at the city-state, not the greater empire, and frequent revolts required the rapid deployment of soldiers from the core cities to quell rebellions. Through the period of expansion the Mexica gradually rose to preeminence among the three original alliance members.\n\nAfter scuttling his fleet off the Veracruz coast, Cortés and his crew of ~450 fighting men had their asses handed to them in a battle with the independent city state of Tlaxcala. Seriously, they were surrounded and isolated on a hilltop. Even Bernal Díaz del Castillo admitted they were doomed. Despite near annihilating the Spanish forces, the ruler of Tlaxcala (Maxixcatzin) demanded a halt in hostilities against the advice of his commander in the field (**Cortés 1 - 0 Death**). The Tlaxcala sought to use these new arrivals as allies in the ongoing fight against the Triple Alliance, and gave Cortés safe haven. When Cortés departed Tlaxcala for Cholula, a prominent city and religious center allied with the Triple Alliance, his forces augmented ~1,000 Tlaxcala soldiers.\n\nThe Tlaxcala army, with Cortés auxiliaries, arrived to a frigid reception in Cholula. Cholula should have been a suicide mission. Cortés really had no reason to risk attacking the city. Tlaxcala and Cholula’s history of animosity created significant tension and there is evidence the Tlaxcala convinced Cortés the Cholula planned to murder him. Cortés responded to the tension and intrigue in typical Cortés fashion: he massacred the elites while the Tlaxcala army burned the city (**Cortés 2 – 0 Death**).\n\nCortés marched on Tenochtitlan with the Tlaxcala army of ~6,000 warriors (Gómara’s estimate). He managed to mangle the most basic forms of diplomacy, and decided the best course of action was to capture Moctezuma and hold him for ransom in his own capital. When Pánfilo de Narváez landed on the coast to arrest Cortés for mutiny/treason the situation grew even more desperate. An anxious Cortés left ~150 Spaniards in Tenochtitlan, somehow managed to defeat Narváez, and marched back to the Triple Alliance capital with 1,300 Spaniards plus additional Tlaxcala allies (**Cortés 3 – 0 Death**). In Tenochtitlan, a new leader, Cuitláhuac, was elected in place of the captive Moctezuma. When the Spanish murdered Moctezuma, and many Mexica elites, the fragile peace dissolved and the capital erupted in violence. The Spanish and their Tlaxcala allies tried to escape the capital across a narrow causeway, surrounded by Mexica troops on either side (kinda like [this](http://web.calstatela.edu/orgs/mecha/noche_triste3.jpg)). More than 600 Spaniards and thousands of Tlaxcala perished as they tried to cut their way out of the capital (**Cortés 4 – 0 Death**).\n\nTlaxcalans guided Cortés to safety, harried and hard pressed by the Mexica on the way to Tlaxcala (**Cortés 5 – 0 Death**). Far from providing Cortés free room and board, the Tlaxcala demand a share of the spoils once Tenochtitlan fell, as well as the city of Cholula, freedom from future taxes, and the right to build a citadel in Tenochtitlan. Cortés was in no place to refuse. His weakened soldiers couldn’t fight on, and charges of mutiny/treason awaited his return to Cuba even if he returned. With ingenuity born of absolute necessity, he aided the Tlaxcala in planning the attack against Tenochtitlan. **Six months** of Tlaxcala plotting and accruing allies followed. The final force brought to the siege of Tenochtitlan included the Tlaxcala, Texcoco, Huexotzinco, Atlixco, Chalca, Alcohua, and Tepanecs. After ~~eight~~ **two and a half months of siege** aided by a disastrous smallpox epidemic, a massive Native American army and the Cortés auxiliaries entered Tenochtitlan and destroyed the city. All told, &lt; 2,000 Spaniards and ~200,000 native allies fought in the two year campaign. \n\nThe use of native allies (and Native American and African slaves), or capitalizing on civil wars, was crucial to Alvarado’s campaign into Guatemala as well as Pizarro’s war in the Inca Empire. This reliance on Native Americans as the majority of an invading army would continue as Spanish conquest spread out from the Triple Alliance heartland. The Huejototzingo, who composed a vital portion of the besieging force surrounding Tenochtitlan, continued to ally with the Spanish in subsequent conquests. In 1560 the Huejototzingo rulers, in proper self-promoting form, wrote to the Spanish crown saying\n\n&gt; we never abandoned or left them. And as they went to conquer Michoacan, Jalisco and Colhuacan, and at Pánuco and Oaxaca and Tehuantepec and Guatemala, we were the only ones who went along while they conquered and made war here in New Spain\n\nWhen Coronado invaded the Pueblos along the Rio Grande the *entrada* consisted of ~400 European soldiers and several thousand Native American allies. \n\n*Wrapping Up*\n\nOur popular narrative places the Spanish “great men” at the forefront of conquest, while simultaneously stripping Native American populations of agency. In the popular narrative, Native Americans are rocked back on their heels by conquest, forced into cower in constant reactionary positions, instead of driving events for their own purpose and gain. By examining the complex web of alliances and grievances that drove Triple Alliance politics a different image of conquest emerges. The Tlaxcala used Cortés to fight against an old foe, and later against Tenochtitlan itself, while Cortés used the Tlaxcala to win gold/glory in the hopes of avoiding execution for mutiny and treason. Viewed from this perspective, Cortés was not an ideal conquistador, and tales of superhuman feats of conquest erode in favor of a richer human drama.\n\nFuture posts will delve more deeply into Native American populations after contact. More myths of conquest to come. Stay tuned.",

        "text": "http://np.reddit.com/r/HistoryWhatIf/comments/2qu0gc/what_if_the_europeans_had_not_attempted_to/\n\nI can’t believe that at least four people upvoted this garbage. Because, believe me, yesterday it was at 5 points.\n\n&gt; I think this depends on how you define europeans... If you go far enough back I believe Egyptians have an ancestral link link to middle eastern peoples.\n\nI’m not perfectly sure what he’s trying to say here, but I think he’s saying that since he thinks Ancient Egyptians left Africa (see below) to become Middle Eastern peoples, and because Middle Easterners are Europeans, Ancient Egyptians, who are the ancestors of Middle Easterners, must also have been Europeans. \n\nSo what exactly is a European? Oxford [defines “European” as “a native or inhabitant of Europe,”]( http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/European) or alternately as “a person of European parentage.” Since most Ancient Egyptians were obviously not natives or inhabitants of Europe or people of European parentage, by definition Ancient Egyptians were not Europeans. Same for modern Middle Easterners.\n\nBut it seems to me that this guy meant “European” as “the European race”; synonymous with “Caucasian race.” It is true that most Ancient Egyptians would have looked similar to modern Egyptians, and modern Egyptians are traditionally classified as Caucasians. However, [most anthropologists today agree that race is a social construct]( http://www.aaanet.org/stmts/racepp.htm):\n\n&gt; In the United States both scholars and the general public have been conditioned to viewing human races as natural and separate divisions within the human species based on visible physical differences. With the vast expansion of scientific knowledge in this century, however, it has become clear that human populations are not unambiguous, clearly demarcated, biologically distinct groups. Evidence from the analysis of genetics (e.g., DNA) indicates that most physical variation, about 94%, lies within so-called racial groups. Conventional geographic \"racial\" groupings differ from one another only in about 6% of their genes. This means that there is greater variation within \"racial\" groups than between them. In neighboring populations there is much overlapping of genes and their phenotypic (physical) expressions. Throughout history whenever different groups have come into contact, they have interbred. The continued sharing of genetic materials has maintained all of humankind as a single species.\n\nSo Ancient Egyptians are not Europeans, and they do not belong to the Caucasian “race” (except in the eyes of the public), since “race” does not really exist.\n\n&gt; Let's say Africa got to keep the Egyptians... \n\nHe appears to be saying that the Egyptians left Africa in real life. [They did not.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wz50_nx8UDg) Really, why would millions of peasants suddenly decide to migrate into Asia for no reason? \n\n&gt; then obviously the Egyptians would have ruled over them\n\nI’m assuming that “them” are Africans traditionally considered “black”, like Nubians. \n\nBased on the word “obviously”, I think it’s pretty clear that this guy thinks that the “European” Egyptians are intrinsically superior to “blacks.” Anyways, the Egyptians did not rule over a large part of Nubia for **more than 2,000 years** (they lost control over Kush during the collapse of the New Kingdom, and Makuria came under Egyptian control in the 13th century), and Kush even conquered the Egyptians and ruled it for a hundred years. It’s not at all “obvious” that the Egyptians would have ruled over Nubia. (Egyptians also lost to Ethiopians in the 19th century)\n\n&gt; &amp; the Europeans would have never limited the power of Egypt. So that could be an interesting dynasty.\n\nIt is true that Egyptian history without European expansion into North Africa could have been interesting.\n\n&gt; If the Africans didn't get to keep Egypt you'd have some incredibly primitive people living there. Remember that Carthage came about by contact with Europeans so that wouldn't have existed. I'd hope they'd have the wheel &amp; agriculture but I wonder if they wouldn't be largely stuck in a perpetual hunter / gatherer state.\n\nWhat the fuck.\n\nFirst, **Phoenicians are not Europeans.** Phoenicia is in *Asia*. \n\nSecond, agriculture developed in various places in Africa independently, including in Ethiopia and in various locations in West Africa. Here’s an **incomplete** list of native African crops (source: *Lost Crops of Africa*):\n\n* African rice (*Oryza glaberrima*)\n\n* Finger millet (*Eleusine coracana*)\n\n* Fonio (two species: *Digitaria exilis* and *Digitaria iburua*)\n\n* Pearl millet (*Pennisetum glaucum*)\n\n* Sorghum (*Sorghum bicolor*)\n\n* Tef (*Eragrostis tef*)\n\n* Guinea millet (*Brachiaria deflexa*)\n\n* Celosia (*Celosia argentea*)\n\n* Cowpea (*Vigna unguiculata*)\n\n* Mock tomato (*Solanum aethiopicum*)\n\n* Egusi (*Citrullus lanatus*)\n\n* Enset (*Ensete ventricosum*)\n\n* Horned melon (*Cucumis metulifer*)\n\n* Kei apple (*Dovyalis caffra*)\n\n* Tamarind (*Tamarindus indica*)\n\n* Watermelon (*Citrullus lanatus*)\n\nThird, on the wheel, I’ll just [quote /u/Daeres]( http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2bgqyf/carts_cereals_and_ceramics/)\n\n&gt; One is a specific one to our particular protagonist, who asserts that the wheel is a basic technology. I will have to be generous here and assume that they don’t mean wheel shaped objects, but something that is used in combination with other things as an actual method of assisted locomotion (wheels can move without assistance, but surprisingly rarely is this accomplishing much that’s useful). To my knowledge, the use of wheels for transport has been developed at best twice, and quite probably just once; the certain candidate for now appears to be a relatively small part of western Central Asia, and the possible other candidate is part of Central Europe, but the appearance of the wheel in both areas is so contemporary that’s possible that it represents one phenomena, or that one predates the other. This is a technology that then had to spread throughout the entirety of continental Eurasia, and much of Africa. The Egyptians, Babylonians, Assyrians Hittites, and Mycenaeans did not invent chariots. The Chinese did not invent chariots. The ancient Britons did not invent chariots. The Romans did not invent chariots. The ancient peoples of India did not invent chariots. Every single one of these famously complex societies was reliant on the invention developed in one part of the world. None of these people were ‘smart enough’ to sit down by themselves and realise that wheels can work when going across flat areas. Does this make the ancient Babylonians stupid? Does this make the precursors to the ancient Greeks stupid? Does this make China’s ancient cultures and societies stupid? The use of wheeled transport does not, it seems to my non-engineer brain, seem to be an intuitive piece of reasoning whatsoever. In addition, if Subsaharan Africa (in any of the three earlier definitions) is full of ridiculously large flat areas, somebody maybe ought to tell the enormous, malaria-infested rainforests that dominate Central Africa so that they can find new gainful employment. Or the mountains that rear from the earth like a great crocodile under most of East Africa, right up to the earlier mentioned home territory of D’mt and Aksum. Oh, certainly there were flat bits in Africa, but by asking them to independently develop the wheel you are setting them a task that only at best two places in the entire world have matched, and we don’t even know the names of the people/s that achieved this feat. I don’t think the wheel as a mode of transport looks so simple as our protagonist suggested.\n\n\nBack to the bullshit\n\n&gt; Australia for sure doesn't ever advance beyond the point where Europeans first made contact.\n\nWhat this means is that this guy thinks Australian Aborigines would never have changed had there been no European influence. Since Aborigines are humans, and I really doubt that human cultures cannot *not* change in, say, 30,000 years, that’s obviously not true.\n\n&gt; S. America &amp; N. America are wild cards... there were a small handful of very advanced tribes in N. America who had discovered agriculture, voting, and began living indoors before the appearance of Europeans...\n\nOkay. Here’s an **incomplete** list of native peoples who lived in what is now the United States and practiced agriculture and lived indoors, one for each letter of the alphabet (except g, v, and x)\n\n* The Alabama people\n\n* The Biloxi people\n\n* The Caddo people\n\n* The Delaware people (or the Lenape)\n\n* The Eno people\n\n* The Fox people (or the Meskwaki)\n\n* The Hopi people\n\n* The Iroquois Confederacy\n\n* The Jemez Pueblo\n\n* The Kickapoo people\n\n* The Laguna Pueblo\n\n* The Mandan people\n\n* The Natchez people\n\n* The Odawa people\n\n* The Pawnee people\n\n* The Quapaw people\n\n* The Sioux people (before migration into the Plains)\n\n* The Tewa people\n\n* The Uchee people (or the Yuchi)\n\n* The Wampanoag people\n\n* The Yamasee people\n\n* The Zuni people\n\nA small handful, I know.\n\n&gt; Some of the far northern tribes that had methods of whale hunting and large scale fish traps probably also had the capacity to turn into something. An inhibiting factor would have been their lack of access to metal, I believe they'd gone almost as far as possible without it.\n\nI don’t really see any bad history here. \n\n&gt; Mayans, Aztecs, etc... something could have really come out of that. Again you've got the issue with metal...\n\nMesoamerican civilizations had metal, including gold, silver, and copper. I mean, there’s a whole article on Wikipedia about [Mesoamerican metallurgy.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallurgy_in_pre-Columbian_Mesoamerica) \n\n&gt; and then there's the fact that none of these civilizations had a thousand year run.\n\nThat’s not true. The Maya civilization, for example, lasted for thousands of years (in the same sense that the Ancient Egyptian civilization existed for three thousand years). Also, most states do not manage to exist for a thousand years. The fact that many Mesoamerican states collapsed after a few hundred years isn’t special at all.\n\n&gt; They had a great few hundred years and then it would sort of fall apart.\n\nThat’s true for most cultures and civilizations. Imperial China, the Maya, and Ancient Egypt all lasted for thousands of years, but the Roman Empire fell after a “great few hundred years,” as did the Kingdom of France, the ~~Achaemenid Empire~~, Teotihuacan, Anglo-Saxon England, and hundreds of other cultures, kingdoms, and civilizations.\n\nEdit: Clarification on this. I am aware of the fact that Imperial China has seen dozens of different dynasties and peoples. However, I would say that the Chinese civilization lasted for millennia in the same sense that Ancient Egyptian civilization lasted for millennia. France had a revolution, and Anglo-Saxon England had the Norman rule, both of which fundamentally changed French and English civilization. China had the Mongols and Manchus, and Egypt had the Hyksos and the Persians, but I don't think you can say that Mongols fundamentally changed China or that the Hyksos fundamentally changed Egypt in the same way that the events of the 19th and 20th centuries changed China or in the same way that Islamization changed Egypt. As for Rome, I mean the Western Roman Empire, not the Byzantines (see [here](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/14oins/at_what_point_did_the_eastern_roman_empire_become/), post by /u/Tiako, for the divergence between Roman and Byzantine), which did collapse after less than a thousand years.\n\n&gt; Now we'll never know if that would have been the case in Central America but there are older examples of central American pyramid building tribes that sort of sprang up and then disappeared.\n\n“Disappeared?” Well, there are approximately 7,000,000 Mayas, 3,000,000 Nahuas, 800,000 Mixtecs, 1,000,000 Zapotecs, and 400,000 Totonacs still living today. It appears that there are 16,000,000 natives still living in Mexico. People generally do not suddenly disappear; the Maya Classic Period collapse, for example, was more cultural than demographical, and the Mayas still existed and they still exist. It’s sort of sad how many people forget the fact that the Mayas still exist in the millions.\n\nAlso, “tribes.” \n\n&gt; Incas... I honestly don't think they'd have gone \"farther\" than they did.\n\nI know. How could those stupid Incas have continued developing their civilization without the benevolent Europeans?\n\n&gt; India could probably have something incredible. Look at the \"primitive\" structures they have. Very advanced/developed/complex culture, access to advanced medicine (although probably another 500 years was needed to weed the myth out of it), they have a huge mass of people &amp; seem like they'd be more than okay with slavery (sadly slavery helped build some of the major stuff in the ancient world).\n\nWhat “primitive” structures? I don’t think anyone has called the Taj Mahal a “primitive structure.” \n\nAlso, his claim that 500 years can remove the religious influences in Indian medicine seems completely arbitrary. \n\n&gt; Asia... that's where it's at. Mongolia, China, Japan, etc...if there were this vacuum you suggest; this is where the dominant rival group would come from. I would go a step farther and say that the Chinese or Japanese could have probably surpassed the Europeans somehow... maybe technology or maybe just being a highly ordered society... but this would be the \"other\" group to be afraid of.\n\nNot really much to say here, except that it would be pretty hard for the Chinese to surpass Europe if Europe had not begun colonization, because China was richer than Europe in 1500 (in 1500, Europe’s share of world GDP was roughly 20-24%, while China’s share of world GDP was 25%, according to [this source.](http://www.ggdc.net/maddison/other_books/appendix_B.pdf) )\n\n&gt; TL;DR - if you consider yourself a SJW start flaming me for being racist toward aborigines.\n\n…..\n",

        "text": "So,this is the fatwa from IslamQA I got: http://islamqa.info/en/22473\n\nThe bad history is here(I am not going to touch the issues of theology or jurispudence here):\n\n&gt;after the British had put a stop to the Islamic revolution in India in 1857 CE. \n\nBy this,if they are meaning 'dethroned the Mughal emperor' after the Sepoy Rebellion of 1857(called by a number of people the 'first Indian war of Independence'),the same Mughal Emperor,who had no power outside the walls of the Red Fort...\n\nLet's go on a bit of history...\n\nIn 1737, Maratha forces sacked Delhi following their victory against the Mughals in the First Battle of Delhi. In 1739, the Mughal Empire lost the huge Battle of Karnal in less than three hours against the numerically outnumbered but military superior Persian army led by Nader Shah of Persia during his invasion after which he completely sacked and looted Delhi, the Mughal capital, carrying away immense wealth including the Peacock Throne, the Daria-i-Noor, and Koh-i-Noor. He then signed a treaty,which meant the Persian Afsharid empire annexing all Mughal territories west of the Indus,and  Delhi was thoroughly sacked by Nader.\n\nThe Marathas again occupied Delhi in 1758, and were in control before their defeat in 1761 at the third battle of Panipat, and the city was captured again by Ahmad Shah. However, in 1771, the Marathas established a protectorate over Delhi when the Maratha ruler, Mahadji Shinde, recaptured Delhi and the Mughal Emperor Shah Alam II was installed as a puppet ruler in 1772.\n\n...Which means that since at least 1772,Muslim rulers were not in control of Delhi anymore.\n\nThen,in 1803,Daulat Rao Sindhia after the battles of Assaye and Argaon,in 1803,signed a treaty with the British East India Company(Treaty of Surji-Anjangaon),giving away the Ganges-Jumna Doab, the Delhi-Agra region, parts of Bundelkhand, Broach, some districts of Gujarat and fort of Ahmadnagar to them. So...Delhi was *clearly* under the control of a Muslim power after the Maratha defeat again ^^/s . Serious mode:This meant that the Mughal Emperor,the king of Delhi had thus become a figurehead of the British East India Company,after the Marathas.\n\nAlso,if Muslim rule had collapsed in only 1857,**there is no possible reason that Shah Abdul Aziz Dehlavi in 1803,proclaimed India as Dar al-Harb.**(Citing Taufiq Ahmad Nizami, “Muslim Political Thought and Activity in\nIndia during the First Half of the Nineteenth Century\") here.",

        "text": "(Please excuse my english, and feel free to point odd or obscure phrases, as it is not my first language.)\n\nAbout the Christmas Tree on [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_tree)\n&gt; It is frequently traced to the symbolism of trees in pre-Christian winter rites, in particular through the story of Donar's Oak and the popularized story of Saint Boniface and the conversion of the German pagans, in which Saint Boniface cuts down an oak tree that the German pagans worshipped, and replaces it with an evergreen tree, telling them about how its triangular shape reminds humanity of the Trinity and how it points to heaven.\n\nI don't really know if it's more a bad_religion kind of thing or if this post is fitted to badhistory but I have stumbled across pretty *bad* history of religion accross the internet, mostly about the \"pagan roots\" of christmas. \n\nThanks to Zeitgeist and the like we have had our share of \"Jesus=Mithra\" but I think christmas is a separate issue altogether. Some go to unexpected lengths (and inversely proportionate rigor) to prove every single christmas tradition is in fact a celtic/germanic/nordic tradition stolen by the evil christians. Thus, Santa Claus is in fact Odin, the Advent Wreath comes from pagan something-something nature cult and maybe Saturnalia is invoked somewhere along those lines.\n\nBy all accounts, this is not a new phenomena. You can already find such accusations in protestant polemists of the 17th century, e.g. Du Moulin :\n&gt; « Qui voudroit spécifier toutes les cérémonies et coustumes des Payens que l’Eglise Romaine a epruntées entreprendroit une besongne sans bout » (\"who would like to specify all the customs that the roman church borrowed to pagans would begin an endless task\", Nouveauté du papisme opposée à l’antiquité du vrai christianisme, Geneva, 1627.)\n\nBut I think that in (not so) recent years the focus of the \"pagan accusation\" has shifted. Originally centered around roman borrowings (because more sources I guess) it appears that romans have passed out of fashion (too civilized maybe), and now the cool hedonistic religions of yore are celtic/germanic. Thus some sort of hagiographic fanfiction emerged and the first german missionaries are now said to have invented/stolen the christmas tree in response to the pagan tree worship.\n\nSaint Columbanus (534-615) is hereby said to have kept a pagan tradition because the evergreen tree \"pointed to heaven\" or that its triangular shape \"reminded of the trinity\". Here on [the french Wikipedia page for \"christmas tree\"](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapin_de_No%C3%ABl#Histoire). I have searched the *Vita Columbani* but did not not find the incriminated excerpt and am not a good enough latinist to conclude anything about it, but it seems peculiar that *both* those missionaries living a century apart would have associated the trinity with a fir tree. Maybe the church sent memos, like \"tell them about the TREEnity\" ?\n\nLet's rather look at the well-known anecdote of [Donar's Oak](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donar%27s_Oak) told here.\nBoniface's page mentions the addition of the fir tree [is legendary](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Boniface#Legends) and on the Christmas Tree page,  [one of the notes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_tree#cite_note-12) admits that the story is \"not recounted in the vitae written in his time\" but is in a few educational storybooks, which should be a red flag ? The [other note](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_tree#cite_note-11) is our main concern :\n&gt; Fritz Allhoff, Scott C. Lowe (2010). Christmas. John Wiley &amp; Sons. “**His biographer, Eddius Stephanus**, relates that while Boniface was serving as a missionary near Geismar, Germany, he had enough of the locals' reverence for the old gods. Taking an axe to an oak tree dedicated to Norse god Thor, Boniface chopped the tree down and dared Thor to zap him for it. When nothing happened, **Boniface pointed out a young fir tree amid the roots of the oak and explained how this tree was a more fitting object of reverence as it pointed towards the Christian heaven and its triangular shape was reminiscent of the Christian trinity**.”\n\n\"Eddius Stephanus\" or rather [Stephen of Ripon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_of_Ripon) is *not* Boniface's biographer. He wrote the *Vita Sancti Wilfrithi* relating, you guessed it, the life of Saint [Wilfrid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilfrid) (c. 633 – c. 709)\nEven if we admit without further proof nor reason to do so that Stephen of Ripon was the biographer of both those saints, it doesn't make much sense. If he was around forty at Wilfrid's death in 709, he would have been around 90 when Boniface passed out in 754, which is a *bit* old to write an inexistent biography, you might say.\nSaint Boniface's earliest biographer was [Willibald](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willibald) (c. 700 - c. 780) whose dates of birth and death fits a little bit better. He wrote the *Vita Sancti Bonifatii* that [do relate](https://archive.org/stream/lifeofsaintboni00robiuoft#page/62/mode/2up/search/oak) the falling of the Oak of Thor :\n&gt; Moreover some were wont secretly, some openly to sacrifice to trees and springs; some in secret, others openly practised inspections of victims and divinations, legerdemain and incantations; some turned their attention to auguries and auspices and various sacrificial rites; while others, with sounder minds, abandoned all the profanations of heathenism, and committed none of these things. With the advice and counsel of these last, **the saint attempted, in the place called Gaesmere, while the servants of God stood by his side, to fell a certain oak of extraordinary size, which is called, by an old name of the pagans, the Oak of Jupiter.** [i.e. interpretation romana for Thor/Donar] And when in the strength of his steadfast heart he had cut the lower notch, there was present a great multitude of pagans, who in their souls were most earnestly cursing the enemy of their gods. But when the fore side of the tree was notched only a little, suddenly the oak’s vast bulk, driven by a divine blast from above, crashed to the ground, shivering its crown of branches as it fell; and, as if by the gracious dispensation of the Most High, it was also burst into four parts, and four trunks of huge size, equal in length, were seen, unwrought by the brethren who stood by. At this sight the pagans who before had cursed now, on the contrary, believed, and blessed the Lord, and put away their former reviling. **Then moreover the most holy bishop, after taking counsel with the brethren, built from the timber of the tree a wooden oratory, and dedicated it in honor of Saint Peter the apostle.**\n\nSurprising, huh ? To fight tree worship, he does *not* propose to worship another tree instead of the one he just fell, no, he builds an oratory in honor of Saint Peter.\n\nMixing up hagiographers is a mistake I cannot really imagine being made involuntarily and as I noticed making this post [someone already questioned this source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Christmas_tree#Problem_in_source_material) a few days ago.\nBut with [the few children's book](http://www.amazon.com/St-Boniface-Little-Fir-Tree/dp/1873727151) quoted you'll notice it is a widespread story, not limited to those lines.\n\nI intend to do a few posts on the \"pagan roots\" thing but wiccan/neo-pagan theories are kind of a low hanging fruit so I'll have to focus on what to criticize.",

One thing I noticed is that these games treat stateless people as nonhuman. All the human population 'belongs' to competing civs and the land between civs is just empty wilderness to be colonized. The only representation stateless people get is \"barbarian camps\" that generate perma-hostile warriors who will raid you until you destroy the camps. \n\n2. A second thing I noticed is that war is the main interaction between players. And most of the game is a battle to control land in order to leverage its productive power into military, culture or science points. It seems like things like the **Columbian exchange** have no representation at all in civ games, or the way **\"Greece conquered Rome\"** by influencing Roman religion and culture while at the same time being militarily defeated by Rome.\n\nSo I was wondering what else /r/badhistory had to add...\n\n\nEDIT: woah, 75 comments!

        "text": "So [this](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/progressive/comments/2qn5gz/you_dont_protect_my_freedom_our_childish/cn83p75) kid made this comment:\n\n&gt;In WW II the US may have fought on the right side, but it was for all the wrong reasons. The US provoked Japan so that it had a reason to destroy the Japanese empire, which had encroached on the US empire. Washington didn't give a shit about fighting Nazism or fascism. This fact is bared out by the fact that Washington rejected Stalin's pleas to form an alliance against Hitler, which forced Stalin into the Ribbontrop pact. There is also the fact that the US occupations rehabilitated and put back into power the fascists and Nazi-collaborators almost everywhere, including Italy, Greece, Japan, Spain. In France, de Gaulle was no collaborator, but the US rigged France's second post war election (June 1946) in which the French communist party was going to win. The Victor of that election was going to write the new constitution. The center right party won thanks to the US militaries meddling.\n\nThankfully, /u/sotonohito came in to save the day!\n\n&gt;Hi, guy with a degree in East Asian History here.\n&gt;\n&gt;Your presentation of the US/Japan pre-war history is not only simplistic, but also wrong.\n&gt;\n&gt;The USA was certainly not super friendly with the Empire of Japan, but neither was it actually trying to start a war with Japan. The single greatest thing you could call a provocation was when the USA cut off oil exports to Japan. And that was equal parts politics and necessity, but it certainly wasn't a deliberate effort to provoke Japan into a war.\n&gt;\n&gt;One thing you have to remember is that, if we're being fair instead of Eurocentric, WWII really started in 1931 with the Mukden Incident, when \"rogue\" Japanese officers set off explosives that were blamed on China in order for Japan to start a war to annex a huge portion of northern China.\n&gt;\n&gt;Note also that Japan was already an aggressive imperial power at this time, it had owned Korea since 1910.\n&gt;\n&gt;When it came out that the \"attack\" on a Japanese railway that had provided Japan the excuse to annex Manchuria was actually a set up by Japanese army officers the international community got a mite huffy and started isolating Japan.\n&gt;\n&gt;The USA was actually one of the hold outs against complete embargo against Japan, mainly for the selfish reason that the USA sold a LOT of oil to Japan and wanted to keep that market. Remember, Japan has no oil on the home islands, every cc has to be imported.\n&gt;\n&gt;By the time the USA finally started cutting, then looking at completely ending, oil exports to Japan, the Japanese Empire had managed to piss off just about everyone except Nazi Germany. The initial reports from the occupation of Nanjing were coming out [1].\n&gt;\n&gt;BUT. The main focus of the USA was Germany. East Asia was regarded as a strange, remote, alien place that no real American should give a shit about, for reasons that basically boil down to racism. The US diplomatic and military focus was on Europe, and one thing US political leaders wanted was to increase exports of oil to European allies, which would require breaking export deals with Japan.\n&gt;\n&gt;Finally, Japan didn't really want to conquer the USA. At least not immediately. What Japan wanted was the South Pacific, specifically the islands under Dutch colonial control that produced rubber, manganese, oil, and other necessary supplies for war. And mainly Japan wanted those islands to enable the continued conquest of China and mainland East Asia.\n\n&gt;The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor was intended not as retribution for an end to oil exports, but rather as a warning to the USA to stay out of Japan's way while it annexed the South Pacific. Declaring war on the USA was inevitable for that because Holland and the USA were allies, attacking the Dutch East Indies would inevitably bring the USA into conflict with Japan and Japan's leadership (foolishly, and against the advice of Admiral Yamamoto) believed that starting what they saw as an inevitable war between Japan and America with a decisive victory against the American naval forces would cause the USA (which cared mainly about Europe anyway) to concede the South Pacific to Japan and focus its attention on Germany.\n&gt;\n&gt;Obviously it didn't work out that way.\n&gt;\n&gt;Japan at the time had a large mythology about fighting large, one sided, decisive victories as a way to win diplomatic concessions. A large, one sided, decisive naval victory at Tsushima when the Japanese Navy fought the single most one sided naval engagement in all history and utterly crushed the Russian Baltic Fleet forcing Russia to make large concessions to Japan in the Treaty of Portsmouth which brought an end to the Russo-Japanese war.\n&gt;\n&gt;They intended something similar with Pearl Harbor, a quick attack forcing America to recognize that Japan was serious about owning the South Pacific and forcing American leadership to conclude that opposing Japan in its annexation of the South Pacific would be a foolhardy waste of resources that could better be employed in Europe.\n&gt;\n&gt;[1] I should note that the Japanese brutality in Nanjing was not exceptional, rather it was the standard operating procedure for the Imperial Japanese Army. Invade, kill most men, rape all the women (and they defined \"women\" to include children as young as 11), kill a lot more people, take everything that wasn't nailed down, rape the women some more, kill some more people, and permit the survivors to be slave labor for the army.\n&gt;\n&gt;The reason Nanjing stands out in world memory is because it's where the most complete records of this sort of behavior come from, not because it's the only place the Japanese army acted like that.\n\nUnfortunately, our original moron continued to double-down on his statement after admitting he never knew about the embargo in a determined effort to spin an anti-American statement:\n\n&gt;Thanks for the full background on the oil embargo on Japan, I didn't know all of that. I was wrong to say that is what provoked Pearl Harbor.\n\n&gt;However, the gist of my comment was correct, the US didn't fight for the self-ascribed reasons most Americans believe. I was interested only with the USA's actions in that comment because that was the subject of the parent comment. I certainly didn't mean to minimize the awful aggressiveness and terror of Japanese imperialism.\n&gt;\n&gt;However, I'm sure Washington's imperial conquests must've played a role in the decision to bomb Pearl Harbor. Hawaii itself was just another American colony in 1942, along with the Philippines which was dominated according to what historian Harvey Goldberg called \"open door colonialism,\" and others call neo-colonialism. The US had demonstrated acts of aggression in Japan's backyard before, like the Siberian expedition, which was an invasion of the infant USSR.\n&gt;\n&gt;My point is that the United States' imperial aggression played a role comparable to Japanese imperial aggression. I highlight the former because it is a novel concept to most Redditors and the latter concept is banal.\n\nBut it's still nice to see someone knocked off of his soapbox.",

        "text": "Those whom know me will say that I am not a Bonapartist, that’s because I’m not. What is important in history is to remain objective of the facts for our own biases and all that stuff, bias ruins history. I don’t do bias, I [will]( http://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/26vkbg/was_napoleon_good_or_bad/) and [have]( http://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/256tgt/was_napoleon_good_for_france/) spoken harshly of Napoleon. However for once I feel as if I’m Marius Pontmercy and must defend Napoleon.\n\nIn [this post]( http://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/2qonfh/was_napoleon_a_provincial_rube_blessed_with_a/), I wrote a very standard answer which details that Napoleon was an avid reader and intelligent man. However, I received this post in response by /u/Second_Mate\n&gt;Not only would I suggest that he wasn't a genius, I would go further and suggest that he wasn't a military genius either. He was a successful, and very lucky, soldier, who was able to ride his luck until it ran out. He was also a clever, as well as lucky, political operator. But, although clever, he was unable to sustain or maintain his position without aggressive warfare which ultimately caused his position to become untenable. He ran the French Empire rather in the manner of a mafioso, awarding territories to his family members without reference to either the populations of those territories, or to the political consequences of doing so. The mistakes that be made, both militarily and politically, suggest that he was no genius in either field! He was very good a self-publicity, and it could be argued that, eventually, he started to believe in his own publicity and began to believe that he really was a genius.\nI would suggest \"Bonaparte\" by Corelli Barnett http://www.amazon.co.uk/BONAPARTE-Corelli-Barnett/dp/B00212B1J4/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1419862477&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=bonaparte+corelli+barnett and \"Napoleon\" by Alan Forrest http://www.amazon.co.uk/Napoleon-Alan-Forrest/dp/178087250X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1419862520&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=Napoleon+Alan+Forrest . Actually, I'm not sure that Roberts dispels any myths about Buonaparte at all, more like he has written a detailed biography of the man from the viewpoint of a supporter of the \"Buonaparte was a great man\" trope, using the evidence to support that view, rather than offering a balanced view. By all means read it, but read other less favourable works as well.\n\nRoberts doesn’t belong to the Great Man view of history either, he criticizes Napoleon justly for his slow decay into egotism. Roberts often points to mysogynism, egotism, and placing family on thrones as Napoleon’s major character failings, and that’s only through half of the book. I don’t think that he could be a supporter of the great man trope if he’s criticizing Napoleon for “his continuing lack of sympathy with the essence of the religion of most of his subjects.” How can Roberts and I be buying into the Great Man view of history if we’re not idolizing and praising Napoleon for everything he did? Bah, the books he posted were poorly reviewed as “biased and negative” of Napoleon. Does it mean that I hate them for being negative of Napoleon (or rather Buonaparte as /u/Second_Mate calls him) no, far from it but if the reviewers call out Barnett and Forrest for being biased and unfair, why would I support them. \n\nWith Roberts defended, let’s get to the real meat of this post.\n&gt; he was unable to sustain or maintain his position without aggressive warfare which ultimately caused his position to become untenable.\n\nAggressive Warfare. Now when Napoleon and “Aggressive Warfare” are put together, it’s usually in conjunction with an analysis of how Napoleon would often pursue battle and aim to destroying an enemy’s army to defeat the nation. However, this is not what /u/Second_Mate argues, he argues that the act of waging an aggressive war with Europe is why he was defeated. While partly true, he doesn’t understand how Napoleon was on the political defensive but on the strategical offensive.\nImportant for Napoleon was to go out and meet the enemy’s army on the battlefield. This was to keep the enemy away from France (ensuring peace and prosperity on French soil) and to further put cost on the enemy by depriving it of resources and ruining the morale of the people.  However, we’re not talking about Napoleon on campaign, we’re talking about Napoleon declaring war on others. Let’s go over a list of the individual wars that occurred within the Napoleonic Wars.\n\n* War of the Second Coalition: A war that continues after the First War of Coalition, aiming to strip Republican France of her victories. Formally starts in 1798 but isn’t led by Napoleon. Napoleon did attack Egypt to gain access to British India but was supported by the Directory that was interested in keeping a popular general away from France, hoping he would die. It ends with Russia pulling out after defeats in Switzerland by Massena and Austria pulls out after the defeat at Marengo by Consul Napoleon.\n* War with Britain, 1804-1814/15 started with Britain declaring war on France, both sides were openly breaching the Treaty of Luneville. It did not end until Napoleon’s defeat in 1814/15.\n* War of the Third Coalition: 1805 started with Britain pulling in Austria and Russia by promising to pay hundreds of thousands of pounds to each nation for raising troops to fight against Napoleon (Britain promised Russia 1.5 million pounds per hundred thousand troops raised). It officially started with the invasion of Bavaria (a French protectorate) by Austria. Ended with the treaty of Pressburg that broke up the coalition and forced \n* War of the Fourth Coalition: 1806 started with Prussia formally declaring War on France, giving up the territory of Hannover (which was promised by France to Prussia if Prussia didn’t ally with Britain). Still made up of Britain and Russia with Prussia coming into the fold. It ended with the Treaty of Tilst.\n* The Peninsular War: started in 1807 with the enforcement of the Continental System on Portugal by France but escalated against Napoleon in 1808 when Napoleon turned against Spain and disposed of its ruler. This is the first war where France was the aggressor in the declaration of War.\n* The War of the Fifth Coalition: Austria declares war again in 1809 and again invades Bavaria with the objective of reclaiming land lost to Bavaria and the Kingdom of Italy (with Napoleon was King). The war ends with Austria defeated and the treaty of Schonbrunn.\n* French Invasion of Russia: The second offensive war against Russia and also a war focused on the enforcement of the Continental System. Russia was preparing to fight France, was being courted by British diplomats and Alexander slowly changed his view against Napoleon. This is where things go poorly for France.\n* War of the Sixth Coalition: With Napoleon weak, Prussia and Austria angered at having to give troops for the invasion of Russia and angry over the economic and diplomatic revenges of declaring war on Napoleon, most of the major powers in Europe rise against Napoleon. This is basically a continuation of the Invasion of Russia, but in reverse. It ends with the First Treaty of Paris and the abdication of Napoleon.\n* The Hundred Days: Napoleon returns from Elba and takes Paris without resistance, fights the British-Prussian troops to claim a throne that was basically taken from the absent Louis XVIII. Ends with the Second Treaty of Paris.\n\nSo, there are nine wars that Napoleon was a leader in the government but of those nine, only two were wars where Napoleon/France declared war on others. The common thread here is that Britain was interested in defeating France, but had the economic systems in place to ensure that they could throw money around and have others help them fight Napoleon. What really destroyed Napoleon was the Continental System, which Roberts freely admits is one of Napoleon’s worst ideas, and even worse, helps to destroy the French economy (limiting state income from 55 million Francs to eleven). \n\nSo here, we see that Napoleon wasn’t acting on aggressive warfare but rather acting on the attacks of others.\n\n\nSecond, we have /u/Second_mate painting Napoleon in a two dimensional light. He refuses a genius that has been shown with multiple writings (even writing a commentary on Caesar’s Gallic and Civil Wars), that many have written about and found in his gaze. For Second_Mate, Napoleon is a dumb thug, refusing intelligence to a person and refusing to attribute skill in warfare, saying that it was “luck.” Napoleon believed in luck, but he didn’t rely on it solely.\n\nThird, Buonaparte. \n\nHe continues to call him Buonaparte rather than Napoleon or Bonapate or even The Ogre as the caricatures said.\n\n&gt;\"Was he lucky, yes but to deny his genius is contrarian.\" You appear to be suggesting that his genius is a given and that anybody disagreeing with that is doing so, not because they don't agree, but simply to argue for the sake of it, which suggests that you've decided, as it were, that Buonaparte can only be viewed as a genius, that there can be no other valid view.\n\nThis is an odd thing, Napoleon identified himself as French rather than Italian, he was born on French and raised in schools in France despite never dropping his Italian accent. He spoke French well but not well enough for those like Talleyrand whom were native speakers. Roberts writes this note on Napoleon’s dropping of the U:\n\n&gt; For decades thereafter, British and Bourbon prpagandists re-inserted the “u” in orer to emphasize Napoleon’s foreignness, such as in Fracois-Rene de Chateaubriand’s snappily titled 1814 pamphlet *Of Buonaparte and the Bourrbons and the Necessity of Rallying Round our Legitimate Princes for the Happiness of France and that of Europe,* in which he wrote: ‘no hope was left of finding among Frenchmen a man bold enough to dare wear the crown of Louis XVI. A foreigner offered himself and was accepted.” (Chateaubriand, *of Buonaparte* p. 5). Even after the British Royal family changed the name of their dynasty from Saxe-Coburg-Gotha to Windsor in 1917, some British historians still ridiculed Napoleon for dropping the ‘u’ from his surname.\nIf he wants to deny Napoleon’s belief that he is French, he can do that but it doesn’t change the fact that Napoleon saw himself as French. He dropped the U after the disaster of the Corsican Independence movement led by Palo, whom kicked the Bonaparte family out of Corsica. \n\nOf course, this is nothing unusual, the British continue to demonize a man that was just that, a man. Imperfect and not always morally great, he was the man that led a nation and still holds a prized place in French history. Even a century later, France looked fondly on Napoleon. [The Dream Passes but still lived on in the heart of France.]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19v7TMFbmdc)\n\n\nEdit: Another thing that was forgotten but pointed out by /u/BritainOpPlsNerf, the OP wrote about how Napoleon was successful in Italy (1796 campaign) only because of the failures and mistakes of the Austrians. That would be like saying the failure of France in the Invasion of Russia had nothing to do with the heroic resistance of the Russians, or that Germany's success in 1940 had nothing to do with the failures of France, or that the Allies' victory of Hitler was only due to Hitler's insanity.  He complains about history being one sided yet he only looks at one thing as the cause of victory. History has many facets that cause events, small things can topple empires and the mistakes of others doesn't mean absolute victory, he needs to act on the mistakes to be victorious.",

        "text": "I am pleased to introduce what I hope will be a several part series on the myths of European conquest of the Americas. The genesis for the idea is Matthew Restall’s wonderful book [*Seven Myths of the Spanish Conquest*](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/174710.Seven_Myths_of_the_Spanish_Conquest?from_search=true), as well as ~~constantly reading badhistory that annoys me~~ the wish to provide something interesting to /r/badhistory users. I will borrow the idea of debunking common myths, and several of his examples, from Restall while adding in information either gleaned from my studies, or what other wonderful Amerindian scholars on reddit have taught me. \n\nWithout further ado, we’ll dive in…\n\n**The Myth: A Handful of Europeans Topple Empires**\n\n/u/snickeringshadow touched on this myth in his wonderful review of [The Collision at Cajamarca](http://np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2bv2yf/guns_germs_and_steel_chapter_3_collision_at/) from the book that shall not be named. Bluntly stated, they myth holds that Europeans were so stinking awesome that it only took a few white guys armed with steel weapons, firearms, horses, and a smattering of bad pathogens to take down the largest empires in the Americas. For those who think I’m setting up a strawman from the beginning, here you go…\n\n&gt; At the battle of Cajamarca recounted above, 168 Spaniards crushed a Native American army 500 times more numerous, killing thousands of natives while not losing a single Spaniard. Time and again, accounts of Pizarro’s subsequent battles with the Incas, Cortés’s conquest of the Aztecs, and other early European campaigns against Native Americans describe encounters in which a few dozen European horsemen routed thousands of Indians with great slaughter. (Voldemort, p.75)\n\nPlease read /u/snickeringshadow’s write-up for another look at the creation of conquest narratives. I’ll be rather brief here. At the root, the handful of adventurers myth embraces the “great men” narrative of history. To quote Restall\n\n&gt; in its absolute form the “great men” approach ignores the roles played by larger processes of social change. It fails to recognize the significance of context and the degree to which the great men are obliged to react to- rather than fashion- events, forces, and the many other human being around them. (p.4)\n\nI touched on “great men” myth while discussing Ridley Scott’s [*1492: Conquest of Paradise*](http://np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2fi9q9/ridley_scott_drives_me_to_drink_a_review_of_the/) where we learned that Columbus took the next logical step in expanding out into the Atlantic, and owes much, if not all, of his modern fame/infamy to 19th-century mythology construction in the English-speaking world. Here, we’ll touch on the creation of the conquistador myth by following the paper trail detailing their exploits.\n\nAfter conquistadores completed their battles, they were required to provide a review of their exploration, conquest and settlement. These *probanza de mérito* served to update the monarch on events in newly conquered land, as well as petition for rewards like offices, titles and pensions. Since the document required authors to lobby for their own gain, *probazas* naturally paint the author in the best, most courageous light, while ignoring the influential role of other conquistadores, native allies, and pure dumb luck. The greatest rewards went to the best shameless self-promotors, and the rules of the game rewarded those willing to stab their compatriots in the back (sometimes literally) in the hope of future gain.\n\n*Probanzas* written by hopeful conquistadores looking for reward flooded back to Spain. The document developed its own genre, with its own accepted writing style, format, and rules of construction as thousands arrived at the court in Seville. *Probanzas* evolved into chronicles, like Bernal Diaz’s *Conquest of Mexico*, and provided justification not only for the actions of individual conquistadores, but also, in a larger sense, justified imperial expansion to bring civilization and Christianity to the New World. Uncritically examining these documents for a history of conquest is akin to writing a biography based on your embellished résumé. Sure, some elements of reality emerge, but when the whole point is to make yourself, your monarch, and your god look supreme, truth becomes a flexible concept.\n\nUnlike the majority that were likely not even seen by royal eyes, Cortés’s *cartas* were published and translated into five languages, grew immensely in popularity, and were subject to royal ban as his cult of personality became a political threat to the crown. His status only increased with Gomara’s hagiography in 1552. Again, the crown tried to suppress that as well. Among modern English speakers, we inherit the cult of Cortés, and to a lesser extent Pizarro, through Prescott’s *The History of the Conquest of Mexico* (1843), and *The History of the Conquest of Peru* (1847). Prescott used the *cartas*, *probanzas*, and previous works like Gomara’s to produce a story of conquest rooted in the mindset of imperial expansion common to mid-nineteenth century Americas. Though Prescott’s books were written more than a century and a half ago, they are still read by popular writers and laymen who fail to critically examine both the bias in his sources, as well as the cultural influences underlying his own work. In the modern popular narrative, Cortés and Pizarro are upheld as the ideal conquistadores, the representatives of how Europeans toppled powerful nations not fit to withstand entry into a modern world.\n\n**The Reality: Cortés and the “Conquest” of Mexico**\n\nWell, I was going to write something here. Trust me it was going to be an awesome. However, yesterday /u/Ahhuatl [tore an *Economist* article on Cortés to shreds](http://np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2qjnyo/should_it_mexico_accept_the_historical_record/). Their write up was great, as was subsequent discussion. I’ll shall not attempt to duplicate their work. Let’s move on, armed with the knowledge that the written *probanzas*, and our inherited mythology of conquest do not reflect the reality of the Conquest of Mexico.\n\n**The Reality: The Fates of Other Conquistadores**\n\nThe myth of Cortés obscures a simple reality of conquest: many conquistadores failed, losing their lives and fortunes in the quest for riches. In North America, most of the original attempts to gain a foothold on the continent ended in disaster.\n\nThe inhabitants of the New World didn’t simply surrender, or run away with the sound of gunpowder, or quake at the sight of men riding horses. They resisted, accommodated, developed alliances with, or consolidated against, Europeans arriving on their shores. Native communities used the Spanish for their own ends, and dynamically adapted to the changing political landscape that accompanied Spanish colonial outposts. Future badhistory write-ups on the myths of conquest will focus on the myths of completion of conquest, the myth of Native American inactivity/hopelessness/inability to change after contact, and the inevitable decline narrative. For right now, though, here is a quick look at the ends for several major North American *entradas* just to show that Cortés’ “success” was an outlier…\n\n* Juan Ponce de Leon’s second journey to Florida ended in disaster shortly after landing on the Gulf Coast. Calusas attacked his party, wounding de Leon with an arrow. The *entrada* returned to Cuba, where de Leon died of his wounds.\n\n* Lucas de Ayllón mortgaged his fortune to mobilize a group of 600 colonists to head toward the U.S. southeast. He established San Miguel de Gualdape, the first Spanish settlement in what is now the United States. The colonists arrived too late in the season to plant, and fell ill, likely due to contaminated water sources. After Ayllón succumbed to illness, the colony fractured and abandoned San Miguel. Less than 150 colonists survived to limp back to Hispaniola.  \n\n* After losing an eye fighting Cortés at Cempoala in Mexico, Narváez was appointed *adelantado* of Florida. His unfortunate decision to split his land and sea forces after landing near Tampa Bay was but one of many disastrous mistakes. Hunger, hostilities with the Apalachee, and illness diminished the strength of the land forces, who failed to reconnect and resupply with their sea-based comrades. Narváez decided to skirt the gulf coast back to Mexico, and died on a make-shift raft blown out into the Gulf of Mexico near Galveston, Texas. Only four men, including the famous Alvar Cabeza de Vaca, survived the final overland journey through Texas and into northern Mexico. \n\n* Hernando de Soto survived the conquest of Peru, only to die on the banks of the Mississippi after pillaging his way through the southeast. The exact location of his grave remains unknown and the tattered remnants of his forces limped south to the Gulf of Mexico.\n\n* The *entrada* into New Mexico bankrupted Francisco de Coronado. He died in Mexico City, exonerated of changes of crimes against the Native Americans, likely because the magistrate considered him a broken man “more fit to be governed… than govern”. Coronado’s chief lieutenant faced similar charges of brutality, was tried in Spain, found guilty, and died in prison.\n\nFar from universal dominance of primitive peoples who lacked the technology to resist, examining the fates of conquistadores in North America shows the messy, violent, and complex side of contact, both for Spaniards trying to win their fortune in the New World as well as the inhabitants they encountered. Technological “superiority” meant nothing when faced with overwhelming numbers, poor terrain, dedicated resistance, absence of food reserves to support a pillaging army, and a lack of logistical support to maintain frontier outposts. Upholding Cortés and the Myth of the Conquest of Mexico as the model for Spanish success provides a false perspective on the nature of contact in the early colonial period. A handful of adventurers never toppled an empire, and conquest would be a constant battle, a constant negotiation, enacted over the course of centuries.\n\nMore myths of conquest to come. Stay tuned.",

I invite the cooler heads of Mesoamericanists to chime in and keep me in check.\n\nWhat a crock of shit.  The idea of the Economist writing a history of the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire makes me want to vomit.  Almost immediately it jumps into outdated understandings of the Conquest and racially-based stereotypes.\n\nHernan Cortes is not a \"protagonist\", he was butcher.  He was not cunning or a good military commander, his bad decision resulted in the death of much of his forces and lead his men into unnecessarily dangerous situations.\n\n&gt; He exploited seething tribal rivalries to conquer a civilisation—albeit with the help of gunpowder, smallpox and his wily Indian lover.\n\nNo, indigenous people exploited his ignorance to topple the Aztec Empire.  If it were not for the fact that disease decimated the peoples of Cemanahuac, Cortes and the Spanish would have been pushed out of the Americas altogether too.\n\n&gt;and the more gold they gave him as a bribe to stop him travelling to Tenochtitlán\n\nA Spanish misinterpretation of Moctezuma's actions and Aztec culture that is absolutely ridiculous when you think about it.  Within Aztec society gifts and displays of wealth were a means of asserting power and forcing the recipients to serve the elite.  Why would Moctezuma, the most powerful man in North America, be afraid of a handful of dirty foreigners who couldn't even feed themselves?  Moctezuma had no solid information about the capabilities of the Spanish.\n\n&gt; He double-crossed men loyal to the Cuban governor, Diego Velázquez, to give himself free rein to pursue his path to glory in service of the King of Spain.\n\nNo, Cortes committed treason.  By ignoring the orders of Diego Velazquez and trying to conquer the natives (rather than make trade deals  as he was ordered to) Cortes ensured that when he returned to Spain **he would be executed.**  Cortes burned his ships not because he was this brave military commander, he burned them because he was terrified of going back to Spain and would have rather taken his changes in the unknown rather than face certain death at the hands of the Spanish.\n\n&gt;And he realised the usefulness of Indian allies, above all the alluring Malintzin, or La Malinche, who had been given to him as a slave a few weeks before and whose linguistic skills and womanly wiles helped him penetrate the great Aztec empire by brokering pacts with its enemies.\n\nOh yes, Malintzin had a vagina and could speak the native tongue, so **that** made her valuable.  Hernan Cortes would end up having literally tens of thousands of natives on his side that could speak indigenous languages.  Malintzin was important not because she was a woman but rather because she was a noble.  She knew how to associate with elites and navigate the politics of the region.\n\n&gt;Here the Spaniard inspired the sport in which Mexicans continue to excel: tax-dodging. He incited the chieftain to jail some of Moctezuma’s haughty and perfumed tax-collectors, only to secretly free them later so that they would return to their lord and give a favourable account of the stranger’s magnanimity.\n\nWhat a hilariously backward interpretation of Cortes' interaction with Xicomecoatl.  Oh yes, Cortes the great liberator, knowing nothing about the Aztecs chose to protect and encourage the Zempoalans.  Here is what really happened:  Cortes stumbled blindly into a situation he had only a vague understanding of and was misled by Xicomecoatl into risking the lives of him and his men to serve their interests.   Rebellion against states like the Aztecs was a common and expected part of life in Mesoamerica.  Zempoala had actually tried and failed to rebel some years prior to Cortes' arrival.  Xicomecoatl saw an opportunity to use Cortes to serve his interests while risking none of his own people.  If Cortes succeeded in throwing off Aztec control of Zempoala, he would be free and wouldn't have really spent much of the lives of his own people.  If he had failed, Xicomecoatl could rightly claim that he had been forced to go along with Cortes, who was the one interested in throwing off the Aztecs.  Xicomecoatl exaggerated the injustices they suffered and egged Cortes on for his personal benefit and in the process put the Spanish in **great danger**.  Had Cortes not been so stupid as to fall for Xicomecoatl's plans, he would not have had a negative interaction with the Aztec ambassadors who, in turn, went back to Moctezuma and informed him of Cortes' evil intents.  He would have had then had more time to pass peacefully through the land, rather than immediately having to fight a group of Aztec soldiers that were sent to test the Spanish's military capabilities.\n\n&gt;Led by a local prince, Xicoténcatl the Younger, the Tlaxcalans almost beat Cortés and his men in battle. They quickly killed two of his horses, destroying the myth of the conquistadors’ invincibility. The wounded Spaniards were forced to treat their injuries with the body fat of a dead Indian, the only ointment they could find. But eventually the Tlaxcalans capitulated—\n\nThis is an outright lie.   The Tlaxacalteca did not \"almost\" beat the Spanish, they did beat the Spanish.  The Spanish suffered tremendous losses and nearly had to turn back when the Tlaxacalteca **spared** Cortes and his men.  Why? Because Maxixcatzin, a Tlaxacalteca ruler, convinced Xicoténcatl that the Spanish could be used to fight the Aztecs.  Had Xicoténcatl had his way, all of the Spanish would have died right there in battle.  \n\n&gt;hampered perhaps by their tradition of trying to capture their enemies for sacrifice, rather than slaughtering them.\n\nI love this.  In the beginning Cortes and the Spanish are described these valorous people while the peoples of Ancient Mexico are described as \"blood thirsty\".  Yet here the true hypocrisy of Western versions of the Conquest come out: one of the keys to Cortes' success was that he was so monstrous.  He burned entire cities to the ground, massacred the innocent, and demonstrated a kind of warfare that was so counter to the value that Mesoamerican puts on human life that people supported him out of terror.  \n\n&gt;For a few centuries Tlaxcala did well out of its co-conquest. It earned a royal seal from Spain as a “very noble and very loyal” city. According to Ms Martínez, its Indian caciques were allowed to retain control of their people and fought tenacious legal battles to stop the imperial authorities from stripping them of their rights\n\nA half truth that I am not surprised the Economist completely misrepresented.  The rulers of Tlaxcala were not \"allowed\" to keep their autonomy.  After Cortes' military blunder in Tenochtitlan nearly lead to the deaths of him and all the Spanish, he limped his way back to Tlaxcala where Cortes **begged** the Tlaxcala to help him try and conquer Tenochtitlan again.  Had they said no, Cortes' men would have either starved or been sold into slavery.  Instead, Cortes was forced to give the Tlaxcala complete autonomy in exchange for more support.  The Spanish *owed* the Tlaxcalteca their autonomy.\n\n&gt;History takes a different turn with the final leg of Cortés’s first journey: the approach to Tenochtitlán. In the city of Cholula, which was loyal to Moctezuma, Cortés’s Spanish and Tlaxcalan forces massacred thousands in the main square, though accounts differ as to whether it was a pre-emptive strike to fend off an attack or a simple case of bloodlust.\n\nI am amazed they even phrased the Massacre at Cholula this way.  I am surprised it wasn't \"the glorious and kind Cortes then traveled to Cholula, where he freed the Cholulans from the oppression of carrying around their heads and having children by cutting up both.\"\n\nWhat this article completely ignores is that Cortes did not have to go to Cholula, in fact going to Cholula could have easily resulted in the deaths of all the Spanish.  You see, some years prior to the arrival of the Spanish, Cholula grievously wronged the Tlaxcalteca by supporting the Aztecs over them.  Since then the Tlaxcalteca had been stewing in anger, looking for a chance to get back at Cholula, but lacked the ability to do so because the city was so powerful and had Aztec support.   Marching to Cholula was nearly suicidal and Malintzin actually warned Cortes not to do it.  The lords of Tlaxcala however pressured Cortes to do otherwise and misled him into thinking the danger was not so great, specifically because a fight there served their interests, not his.  While it is true that accounts vary as to whether or not the Cholulans were planing to attack the Spanish, anyone who understands the politics of the players here is going to conclude that the Spanish were tricked into attacking the Cholulans.  Even Spanish sources confirm that it was the Tlaxcalteca who who planted the idea that the Cholulans were planning to attack them in head of Cortes.\n\n&gt;Along one of them, the Calzada Mexico-Tacuba, Cortés fled on a rainy night in 1520, pursued by enraged Aztecs avenging the death of their emperor.\n\nWhat is that?  We're going to completely skip over how Moctezuma was killed?  We're not going to mention that the Spanish were warmly welcomed in Tenochtitlan, that were treated well, and then the Spanish brutally murdered the Aztec nobility at a social function where literally no one hard arms?   We're not going to mention that the Spanish, who over the course of several months came to love and admire Moctezuma, may have actually killed him when they discovered he was not of any use to them?  We're not going to talk about all how the guns, steel, and horses of the Spanish - the things which supposedly made them invisible - did absolutely nothing to stop the Aztecs from killing up to 80 percent of the Spanish forces?   How surprising.\n\n&gt;Should it accept the historical record, with all its brutality, come to terms with the inevitability of Tenochtitlán’s fall and celebrate the boldness and enterprise of Cortés and his men?\n\nThis is so fucking outrageous that I can't believe the author wrote it.  I don't know what is more offensive, the fact that they've completely manipulated the historical record or that they'd suggest that the Aztecs were \"inevitability\" slaughtered.  There was **NOTHING** inevitable about the fall of Tenochtitlan.  At every step of the way Cortes' could have died in a Mesoamerican battlefield and his name would not have even been a footnote in the pages of history.  One of the reasons why so very many people are so very angry about the Conquest now is because still - after 500 years - it is told in a way that fundamentally degrades and warps reality.   That for all this talk of us being mestizos and a country of two worlds, our history is told in a way that renders half of the world invisible and inferior.  It is not just an insult to just the Mexica but also to the Tlaxcalteca to the Totonac and ALL people with indigenous blood in their veins.  \n",

So, surfing through facebook I see a friend had posted a [link on Egypt's ban of the movie 'Exodus'](http://nsnbc.me/2014/12/26/egyptian-govt-bans-exodus-gods-and-kingsciting-historical-religious-fallacies/). Piqued my interest, being a welcome change from the usual Facebook drivel, so I open it up. Fairly interesting read, nothing too crazy. And then I stumble into the comments section, wherein the subject of today's bad history comes into play. Enter: NewYorker:\n\n&gt; The people who built the pyramids were not called Egyptians but Kemit Nu (thee are several spellings of this word)which means black people.\n\nRight off the bat, first damn sentence and we are off to the races. Ok, so called by whom? If you're telling me they didn't call themselves Egyptians, I wholeheartedly agree. But 'Kemit Nu' doesn't mean black *people*. It means Black *earth* or *soil*. But we can see see now where this is headed. You wont BELIEVE what he had to say next.\n\nLiterally the following sentence:\n\n&gt;The word Egypt did not come into existence until over 100 years ago when the British called the current people live there the name because it sounded “romantic”.\n\nText book bad history, that literally ONE GOOGLE SEARCH would correct. The word 'Egypt' or its likeness didn't come into convention in goddamn 1900. The British didn't just pull the word out of thin air to 'romanticize' the land. Egypt comes to us from the *ancient Greek* Aigyptos. After all, Egypt was ruled by the Greeks for some time....IN THE HUNDREDs *BCE*. After which it was ruled for another few centuries by the Romans who, shockingly, called it some precursor of 'Egypt'. Theres literally nothing more to elaborate here. He/she is on to something though (even though he/she doesnt know it). Before the British reintroduced the term 'egypt' into convention, that land went by another name (as it still does): Misr/Masr. This is because between Greco-roman civilization and modern Egypt, there was another. And this too homeboy is aware of. But unfortunately, thats about the extent of their knowledge. That the Arabs existed in egypt at some point.  Exhibit C:\n\n&gt;The current “Egyptians” are Arabs and Muslims who moved into the area 1500 years ago after the Kemits left\n\nOk, so I guess we are ignoring the several thousands of years worth of history between the Pyramids and the Arabs. Fine. But heres what I don't get, and Id love for an expert to chime in real quick...how in Gods name did the Arab Muslims occupy the now vacant Egypt **56 years before the birth of Muhammad?!?!?!?**. Ok, lets give him/her the benefit of the doubt. They are very casual with dates, thats cool. But I would LOVE to hear why the kemits just 'left' Egypt. Where did they go? Why did they just leave? Cus the narrative being painted for me here is that these Arab Muslims who existed before Islam just straight moved in to an empty Egypt that was abandoned. If any of yall are familiar with Egypt's history and status in the ancient world, as I'm sure many of you are, you know damn well that Egypt isn't a land that one just up and abandons. \n\nBeyond this however, if we look at the actual history of  Egypt around the time of early Islamic conquests, we can see that as with the other places the Arabs conquered- population change did not happen in any significant measure till a long ways in. Leadership changed, but the Arabs did NOT replace the natives, nor did they even assimilate for a long time. Egyptians after conquest were....wait for it....EGYPTIANS!! In fact, the word 'copt' ultimately comes, in an ironic twist of fate, from the Greek 'Aigyptos' via Arabic. Mind. Blown. \n\nNewYorker wraps up with:\n\n&gt; So NO. They are not the true people who built the pyramids. I strongly believe the Masai are the true descendants of the Kemit. The garments that the were and the walk they walk are identical to the hieroglyphics on the walls of the pyramids.\n\nWho? The Arabs? The British? Who claimed the Arabs build the Pyramids? I think we all agree that the Pyramids were built by the Ancient Egyptians, whatever you wanna call him. That they were black? [Not so much.](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cb/Egyptian_races.jpg). He/she strongly believes the Masai are the *true* descendants of the Kemit. Far be it from me to insult their beliefs, so I won't go there. But that last line doe, it baffles me. The \"walk they walk [is] identical to the hieroglyphics\"? Holy shitballs yall, I wasn't aware the hieroglyphics were GIFS!!!.\n\nSo, as we can see, literally every.single.line. was bad history. Commentor Rahlistic chimes in \"New Yorker, you are right on.\" \n\nHold on guys, I just face palmed so hard I got a concussion, brb. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOk back from the hospital. So Rahlistic's words of encouragement inspired homeboy to make another post. If there was any doubt as to wether or not NewYorker is a badhistorian^TM, he/she makes it a personal matter to remove all doubt:  \n\n&gt; “Africa” (which is a Spanish word btw) had a lot of powerful kingdoms. As you mentioned Kush (Cush)and don’t forget the Axum located in Ethiopia. The history of blacks have been rewritten to make it appear as though our contributions to history were only the building of the pyramids. How is that possible? Every culture that has architecture of that magnitude also had some form of math, science, philosophy, poetry etc. A wonderful book to read regarding “Egypt’s” true history is called “Stolen Legacy” by George GM James which describes how the Greeks/Romans stole the Kemit history (math, science etc.) and were given credit \n\nWow. After parsing his/her first post line by line, im running low on fuel. So I can't bisect every single thing in this complex, layered badhistory^tm. But lets see, off the top of my head, Africa had a lot of powerful kingdoms? whole heartedly agree. Africa is a spanish word btw? Not so much. Africa comes to us from *Latin* (read: not spanish), in reference to Carthaginians. After which, the Romans would have a province named the very same for many moons. That in turn coming from some Phoenician root...again...not Spanish.\n\nThe history of blacks has been rewritten to make it look like the only thing they accomplished was building the Pyramids he says. Hate to burst your bubble bud, but outside of conspiracy theory and not-so-respected  revisionists, *no one is claiming that*. If you think thats what he thinks convention was *rewritten into*, even the status quo history in this guys head is bad revisionism. But just when you think it cant get any better, NewYorker leaves us with another gem. Apparently, Greeks and Romans stole Kemit history (math, science, etc.). Greek philosphers don't real, bros. Euclid? Pythagoras? FRAUDS. You've heard it all folks. But wait...theres more!\n\n&gt; the greatest “Greek” poet of all times Aesop turns out to be a BLACK ETHIOPIAN. The ancient Greek word Aesop means Ethiopian.\n\nI can't even. I literally cannot. Aesop, even to us today is a historical enigma. In that, we don't even know if he actually existed. The man may have been a fable himself. In either case, you figure that if Aesop was in reality or in myth a *Black Ethiopian*, surely this is something that the Greeks or Romans would've mentioned a few times. I highly doubt Herodotus would've left a detail like that out. Does Aesop mean Ethiopian? Again, I can't say. Because the etymology of the word is also elusive. But lets give them the benefit of the doubt, lets say it does mean 'Ethiopia'. That fact confirms his skin color in the same way Scipio Africanus' name confirms his status as a man of African origins. In that, it doesn't. Who knows how Aesop's name came to be that, should NewYorkers claim be true? All evidence leads me to believe however that this person is not correct in this instance. \n\n\nIn reflection, and to wrap things up, when African revisionists or any revisionists behave like this- blatantly making stuff up, disseminating bad info, and co-opting the achievements of others (especially the ones they claim have oppressed them), all they are doing is hurting their own cause. They shun the actual achievements of those they claim to champion, and end up-in the deepest of irony- validating their oppressors accomplishments as worthy of claiming. I know this was kinda low hanging fruit, but I just couldn't not share it with yall. Cheers!\n",

        "text": "So /r/kotakuinaction, that bastion of intellectual discourse, brings up many hilarious but bad points to dissect.  \n\nFirst off, this bad history begins when [someone unironically equates \"SJWs\" to Hitler](https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/2qftoq/anita_weaponizes_a_school_shooting_against_males/cn5s0hj) and states that the social science \"privilege\" concept is analogous to the way the Nazis talked about the Jews. But that's more /r/badsocialscience territory, so let's talk about the discussion that ensued about the Nazis. \n\n---  \n\nThe bad history:  \n\n[Comment 1](https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/2qftoq/anita_weaponizes_a_school_shooting_against_males/cn5zm6n?context=4)  \n\n&gt;I know about the treaty of Versailles, and it is of course terrible what happened. Everybody accepts that, and everybody agrees that the demands were unreasonable.   \n\n&gt;That aside it is simply not true to say that \"extremist conservatives\" go after some random minority because it is a minority. Jews in Germany were a minority, but that isn't why they were persecuted. **Furthermore, Nazism was decidedly left wing. Don't believe what the media tells you on this subject. Read the source material if you dare. The evidence that National Socialism was a left-wing movement is irrefutable.**  \n\n[Comment 2](https://np.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/2qftoq/anita_weaponizes_a_school_shooting_against_males/cn5wyzb?context=7)  \n\n&gt;Democracy is no safeguard against radicalism in and of itself. Look at how many supporters these SJW's have. By the way, Adolf Hitler was NOT democratically elected. **The left (yes, Adolf Hitler was a socialist aka FAR LEFT)** was in a slight minority in 1932. He just ordered the SS to kill his opponents or scared them into submission.  \n\n---  \n\nExplanation:  \n\nThere WAS a left-wing faction among the Nazis that tried to recruit the same working-class people that the communists in Germany did, most notably they were led by Strasser brothers. Hitler himself was a part of the \"conservative\" wing of the Nazi party, with one of the Strasser brothers being murdered in 1934 when Hitler purged the left-wing elements of the Nazi party.  \n\nThe Nazis who emerged in power afterwards had no ties to socialism whatsoever, and worked pretty closely with big business.  \n\nThe Nazis promised to enact some socialist policies (see: points 14 and 17 of the [25 point program of the NSDAP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Socialist_Program#The_25-point_Program_of_the_NSDAP)), of which they dropped and enacted only the nationalist policies.  \n\nAlso the fact that the Nazis frequently targeted Social Democrats and communists for arrest in the mid 1930s, mostly because they disagreed with the rhetoric, viewing it as a danger to their unity. They banned the Social Democratic Party in 1933 and tried to convince the public that the SPD was trying to corrupt Germany.  \n\nI LOVE this logic. Hitler = Socialist is such a lazy way of thinking. Nazis = bad, nazis = socialist, thus socialism = bad. kek.  \n\n[There's a lot more rebuttals to the Nazis = Socialists bad history in this old badhistory thread.](http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/1oval1/rebuttals_to_the_nazis_were_socialists_arguments/)\n\n---  \n\nAmongst hilarious bad history there, you should be ABSOLUTELY SHOCKED of finding these kinds of posts:  \n\n&gt;Back to your original point, I think the Zionists are much more involved in this than people know. Search for ties between Femen and Jed Sunden. He is basically funding them to attack Islam and Christianity while attacking Jewish values is off limit. Again, don't take my word for it but you will find a lot of shady stuff behind the scenes if you look for it.  \n\n#  \n\n&gt;That said, I'm not saying we should wipe Israel or any nation off the map because I know there are more innocent and good people than rotten apples. Hence why I don't simply label them as Jews but rather as Zionists.\nEdit: Another thing Which I don't necessarily consider a solid theory, but a shit ton of American media is owned by rich Jews. This one I don't 100% subscribe to. But still. Food for thought, none the less.  \n\nTHE JOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOSSSSS\n\n",

        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2qfzun/jared_diamond_on_japanese_origins_1998/",
        "text": "I recently read [an essay about Japanese history](http://discovermagazine.com/1998/jun/japaneseroots1455/), written by Jared Diamond in 1998. There’s quite a lot of bad history and linguistics there, but I was tired and busy, so I couldn’t do a R5 for the whole thing. So just two paragraphs.\n\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n&gt; Finally, with the completion of Japan’s first chronicle in a.d. 712, Japan emerged into the full light of history.\n\nNo.\n\nAlthough the *Kojiki*, written in 712, was indeed the first *extant* Japanese chronicle, there is also the *Kokki* and the *Tennoki*, both written in the 610s under Prince Shotoku (the *Tennoki* was finished in 620). And let’s not forget the *Teiki*, written in 682. None of these survive today, but the *Kojiki* is **not the first Japanese historical chronicle.**\n\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n&gt; Given the overwhelming advantage that rice agriculture gave Korean farmers, one has to wonder why the farmers achieved victory over Jomon hunters so suddenly, after making little headway in Japan for thousands of years. What finally tipped the balance and triggered the Yayoi transition was probably a combination of four developments: the farmers began raising rice in irrigated fields instead of in less productive dry fields; they developed rice strains that would grow well in a cool climate; their population expanded in Korea, putting pressure on Koreans to emigrate; and they invented iron tools that allowed them to mass-produce the wooden shovels, hoes, and other tools needed for rice-paddy agriculture. That iron and intensive farming reached Japan simultaneously is unlikely to have been a coincidence. \n\nDiamond claims that iron tools are somehow necessary for wet-field rice cultivation.  [Wet-field rice cultivation began in Korea around 600 BC or earlier.](http://www.academia.edu/798599/The_archaeology_of_early_agriculture_in_the_Korean_peninsula_an_update_on_recent_developments) \n\n&gt; Excavations of the Mumun layer revealed that the wet-field feature was approximately 80m^2 in area and contained carbonized rice, red-burnished pottery, digging tools, and fishnet sinkers similar to ones found in the Mumun structures (KNTP-MTP 1998: 15). Kyongnam University Museum researchers may have been unable to excavate the feature to its full extent because of a highway right-of-way immediately south of the site. Bunds that were between 16 and 52 cm in width divided the flat wet-field surface into rectangles that were between 2.2m^2 and 4m^2 in area. Various irrigation canals surrounded the wet-field area. The layout of the Oghyon wet-field appears similar to the wet-field at the Initial Yayoi Notame site in Fukuoka Prefecture, Japan, as shown in Imamura (1996: 136). Kyongnam University Museum researchers estimate that the wet-field feature dates to between 700 and 600 BC (KNTP: 1999: 169).\n\nTo be fair, the *exact* date estimates for the Oghyon rice paddies came out a year after Diamond wrote his essay. But the existence of Classic Mumun artifacts in the Oghyon paddies was already known when Diamond released this essay, so archaeologists already knew that the people at Oghyon were practicing wet-field cultivation before at least 550 BC.\n\nEven if we allow for the fact that Diamond may not have known of Oghyon because the excavations there were recent at the time, there’s also Songguk-ri, a village inhabited from the 6th to 5th century BC. The people at Songguk-ri practiced rice-paddy agriculture and had political stratification. Since Songguk-ri was discovered in *1974*, and since it’s arguably the most famous Bronze Age site in the entire Korean peninsula, I have to assume that Diamond knew of the Songguk-ri rice paddies.\n\nSo if Diamond knew of Songguk-ri, he believes that in the 6th century BC, Koreans had the technology to create iron tools, since the Songguk-ri paddies date from the 6th century BC and rice-paddy agriculture requires iron tools. Is he right?\n\nThe first iron artifacts in the Korean peninsula are Chinese (the Yan kingdom) in origin and are generally found with knife money from the Yan Kingdom. There is no Korean iron until about 200 BC, only Chinese iron that ended up in Korea through trade. By the 2nd century BC, though, iron farming tools increase dramatically (probably spread by Chinese refugees that seized power in northwestern Korea in 194 BC) and it seems that “Koreans” learned how to forge iron (weapons, however, were still bronze). With the conquest of northwest Korea by the Han Dynasty in 108 BC, iron finally replaced most bronze weapons and most stone tools in Korea.\n\nSo no, Jared Diamond, **iron tools are not necessary for rice-paddy agriculture.** “Koreans” were practicing rice-paddy agriculture five centuries before they learned how to forge iron tools.\n\nThis reminds me:\n\n&gt; That iron and intensive farming reached Japan simultaneously is unlikely to have been a coincidence. \n\nDiamond seems to think that the Japanese of the Early Yayoi Period knew how to forge iron tools. This is not true. The oldest iron tools in Japan, dating from the Early Yayoi Period, are generally considered to have been *imported*, and the Middle Yayoi Period (starting around 100 BC) is generally considered the start of local iron-making (basing this on *The Cambridge History of Japan, Volume 1*). Quoting from that book:\n\n&gt; [The first iron artifacts in Japan] are thought to belong to the second century B.C. […] Most Early Yayoi artifacts, of Chinese-style foundry-made iron, were probably items of trade […] But one suspects that the phenomenal increase from Early to Middle Yayoi cannot be explained simply in terms of trade with Chinese colonies.\n\n(Clarifications/Corrections on Yayoi iron are welcome)\n",

        "text": "http://www.np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/2qdsoi/william_the_bastards_coronation_christmas_day/cn59ais\n\nThis one. . .this was a mess, folks. Drawn directly from an Askhistorians thread. Have a look if you will; there are some choice bits, and some of my better attempts at refutation and debate.\n\n&gt;The Normans werent Germanic, they were Scandinavian with about century of French cultural appropriation; meaning they were a foreign tribe to England genetically and culturally, regardless of the groups that comprised England. They didnt even speak English, the Normans originated as Vikings that imposed themselves upon France, the Anglos originated as Germanic tribes.\n\nI believe you're misunderstanding the nature of medieval organization. A tribe is generally defined as a group of people claiming descent from a real or mythological ancestor. By this definition, the Normans were no more a tribe than, say, the Burgundians or Aquitanians or Northumbrians were. They were a political polity with only vague connection to the original Northmen, their customs, speech, and political organization being far more similar to the larger Frankish culture than to Norway or Denmark.\n\n&gt;Thats what I mean when I said they had about a century of french cultural appropriation. Genetically, they were distinctly Norsemen.\n\nNo, they probably weren't. The original core of Norsemen was almost certainly heavily interbred with the native population - Gallo-Romans and Franks, as well as the neighboring Bretons and Flemish. This was the case virtually everywhere that Germanic groups settled. They were simply too small relative the overall population to maintain anything resembling \"genetic purity.\"\n\n&gt;They Normans werent Germanic they were Norsemen.\n&gt;Given the importance of heredity in medieval times when pertaining to the continuation of the aristocracy, is it not more probable the Normans were still very much Norsemen during the Conquest of England? Given that they occupied Normandy France for only about 100 years before the conquest?\n\n\nThe Norse were a Germanic people, in the sense that they spoke a language derived from Proto-Germanic, which spawned the three base languages from which the modern Germanic languages derive: West, North, and East (now extinct) Germanic. That is to say that Old Norse is no less Germanic than, say, Old English (itself derived from West Germanic). That's all the two designators mean; Old Norse is a Germanic language, which has further evolved into modern languages such as Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish.\n\nWell, my first example of interbreeding would be William the Conqueror himself. His father, Duke Richard I, was half-Breton through his mother, and quarter-Frankish through his paternal grandmother. William's mother Herleva, the daughter of a prominent Rouen merchant, was almost certainly of mixed descent; there simply weren't that many Norsemen who made the trip over to replace the native lower classes. Just as Franks always made up a small minority of the kingdom they founded, the Normans began as a distinct political elite that became more and more mixed with the larger native population.\n\n&gt;The genetic origins of the Normans was that of Scandinavia, the genetic origins of the Anglos was Germanic. They are distinctly different tribes.\nFrom the perspective of the English during the Conquest, their country was being invaded by foreigners in both culture, language and heredity.\n\n&gt;This is why I question what really happened during the coronation of William the Bastard.\nWilliam's questionable pedigree was an important factor in those times to his legitimacy as a ruler, hence his nickname. If heredity was important enough to label William as \"The Bastard\" would the foreign origins of the Normans not be a problem for the English who until that point had been ruled by their relatives?\n\nThe Normans were not a tribe. Not in the way that anthropologists define a tribe. They were a group of people who followed an aristocrat to settle in a new land. We aren't even certain of the origins of their first leader, Rollo. Danish, maybe? Or Norwegian? Both of which, by the way, were not tribes by this point in time, but had evolved into a series of petty kingdoms made up of multiple kin groups. For that matter, neither were the Anglo-Saxons, or the Franks. The large Germanic groups that came into the Roman Empire were, generally speaking, confederations of tribes, bound together under an overking.\n\n&gt;I refer to the Normans as a group of people both culturally and genetically distinct from the Anglos they conquered; a tribe.\n\nWhat you are describing is a people, or a culture (not even going to touch the idea of genetic purity), not a tribe. The Normans were no more a tribe than Americans or Mexicans or Canadians are. Words have meaning within this discipline.\n\n&gt;Semantics.",

        "text": "(the title was Kristmas Kavalcade of Konfederacy)\n\nToday we have some wonderful badhistory stemming from a British mistake. Namely two (assumingly) perfectly normal, if somewhat unworldly, Brits posted [this](http://i.imgur.com/qwDYo6q.jpg) to /r/murica, after having bought it in Tejas. So, of course it being /r/murica you have a legion of neo-cons, right? Wrong. Thankfully the population is, like the real US, much saner than that. Unfortunately, like the real US, there's your shining turds, sending out a beacon of lunacy, racism, hatred, and sister-fucking for all to see. So let's jump right into the badhistory, and try and right some wrongs.\n\nI'm going to just quote the idiocy, then debunk. If you want to stay sane, skip the next bit:\n\n&gt;No you are wrong. The civil war had nothing to do with slavery, and also the south freed their slaves at the beginning of the war unlike the north who had slaves a lot longer then the south did. Shit the black folk even fought freely along side the whites for the south. Again unlike the north who used them as human sheilds.\n\n***\n\n&gt;You shut your fucking commie mouth to me. Never did I say the south should rise again. No. These country is better together with our 51 states. I was stating that the flag was beautiful for what it stood for. The real reason the men went to battle. Do you really think our country men would be so stupid to fight eachother over slaves? Fuck no. That would be stupid as shit.\n\n***\n\n&gt;Again this flag had nothing to do with race. It stood for lower taxes, states have more power then federal government, and pretty much every conservative value. It stood for proper representation in congress. Remember it was the north that didn't want to count black slaves as whole people, when the south was saying they were. Come on now people open your eyes and learn some god damn facts. It was the god damn Democrats who started the KKK, who used this flag for hate. Though I am doing far more research on the 1950-70s to try to understand were this hate came from.\n\n***\n\n&gt;this guys got a point up tothe human shield.. We had free blacks fight for the south it's proven in history and they had slaves fight. Look guys do UR research im from the south and I read about a lot of the civil war slavery wasn't an issue for the war until the middle of it. The whole war was started over states right (which had to do with slavery I know) but in general slavery became an issue towards the middle and end and that flag is a battle flag not the actual CSA flag the CSA flag had the stars and bars in the upper left hand corner and I want to say 2 red stripes and 1 white stripe. I don't care about the down votes Im just tired of ppl saying that we as the south are racist mothas for flying our battle flag ok. Ohh and another thing that battle flag has flown in every major conflict after the civil war it's still flys with the Stars and Stripes in Iraq and Afghanistan\n\n***\n\n&gt;Lincoln wasn't for abolishing slavery, at least not at first. At first he didn't want slavery to spread to the western territories. He started trying to abolish slavery after Britain started supporting the south. They were comparing the south session to the revolutionary war which made the union look like the bad guy, oppressing the south, but when Lincoln started liberating slaves it made the war seem like it was about slavery, which every other country had already abolished. Thus, no one would support the south anymore because then it would look like their supporting slavery.\n\n***\n\n&gt;Would you be willing to kill your own brother because he said you couldn't own a lawn mower?\nI know people and lawnmowers are completely different, but the comparison is sound. Slaves were considered property then. I don't know anyone who would, and I sure as shit wouldn't kill my brother over property.\nLincoln's decision to pass the emancipation proclamation was purely a military strategy. He assumed upon hearing of it, Confederate officers' slaves would try to leave, prompting the officers to desert their post in order to reclaim their slaves.\n\n***\n\n&gt;What an awesome flag! Don't listen to these mouthbreathers telling you how evil the confederate flag is. Considering the outcome of the war, the confederacy is as american as apple pie. The name of the confederacy itself is the Confederate States of America. Confederates were always Americans. The flag is a symbol of independence and fighting for what you know is right. It's a symbol of standing up for what you believe and for your home. Don't let anyone tell you that flag is unamerican, they are just from the north. My family fought for the south and I will be damned if will be made to feel embarrassed over the actions of my family. They were fighting for their homes and the right to live the way they wanted. 20% of the soldiers in the union army were not even born on american s soil, and yet they are the wholesome party?\n\n&gt;You guys need to watch Rocky Mountain with Errol Flynn[1]  . The movie is a good example of showing how both sides were filled with good, and the same values. We were all americans. This was a war of brother versus brother, father versus son, uncle vs nephew, and it was truly that way. The bones of my ancestors are resting in the fields of kentucky, tennessee, georgia, alabama and in the confederate cemertery in the prison yard of Alton Illinois, and I'll be damned if if I don't defend when someone demeans the cause they were so compelled to fight for.\n\n***\n\nSo, where to begin in this pile of shit. As our friend, mod, and Comrade /u/turtleeatingalderman explained in this wonderful [three](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1mbgl0/what_historical_figure_has_the_most_undeserved/cc9agc5) [part](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1mbgl0/what_historical_figure_has_the_most_undeserved/cc9ah9b) [peice](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1mbgl0/what_historical_figure_has_the_most_undeserved/cc9ahjz) The civil war was *actually* when you get really down to it about slavery. I know, shocking, right?\n\nIn regards to the CSA freeing the slaves, I would refer to Article 1, section 9, subsection 4 of the CSA constitution \n\n&gt;(4) No bill of attainder, ex post facto law, or **law denying or impairing the right of property in negro slaves shall be passed.** (emphasis mine)\n\nNow, if that doesn't preclude the freeing of slaves, I don't know what the fuck does.\n\nThere's 50 states. apparently the user can't do simple math, like count the STARS ON THE US FLAG. And it's news to me that the basic human rights of several million fellow Americans isn't worth fighting over. \n\nI don't know what the fuck the guy with the human sheild comment is saying, but I'm fairly certain it's wrong, as well as the guy talking about lincoln. If anyone wants to help flesh it out in the comments, that would be nice. This area isn't really my specialty.\n\nI like the cognitive dissonance of \"I know people and lawnmowers are completely different, but the comparison is sound.\" I don't know what led them to believe that the Emancipation Proclamation was made to convince confederate officer's slaves to leave and then the officers would be forced to go look for them, but it's kinda off the wall. \n\nThen we got the last one, and it's a doozie. The confederacy isn't as American as apple pie, apple pie is a more northern associated dish. Some form of cobbler or other pie would be more appropriate here. Sure it's a sign of fighting for what you know is right, if that happens to be the chattel slavery of millions of black people. I'm fairly sure there are many people from the south who would tell you that the CSA battle flag is a symbol of slavery, oppression, tyranny, and generally being racist dickholes. Just because people aren't born in america means they aren't americans now? I thought we were the 'Nation of Immigrants\", but I guess not. You have to be born here to have any moral standing. People need to understand that just because great-great-great-great-gran-pappy fought for the CSA doesn't make it good. \n\nBonus: If you debunk this I'll give you a cookie.\n\n[link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYzAqHD1gHcZ)\n\n\n",

        "text": "About a month ago, /u/shannondoah posted [this submission](http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2mhb2f/in_which_we_learn_that_the_queen_elizabeths/) about [reformation.org's](http://www.reformation.org/) insistence that Queen Elizabeth I was 'Shake-speare'. Upon looking at this site some more, I realised that this site is perhaps the largest treasure trove of bad history ever created, as well as possibly every other bad subject. From instance: Joshua was the Messiah because his name contained the letters alpha and omega (???); Darwin made up evolution so he could marry his cousin; etc. However, this post covers what I think is perhaps the worst badhistory of all: [the myth of anti-Semitism](http://www.reformation.org/khazaria.html). Yes, I realise this is the lowest of the low-hanging fruit, but this is just so fascinating and terrifying I had to post.\n\n&gt;The Khazars adopted the religion of the Samaritans or fake Jews around 740 A.D. By that time, this religion became know as Judaism.\n\n&gt;Old Khazaria existed from about 500 AD to about 1000 AD.\n\n&gt;Old Khazaria adopted the religion of the Samaritans, now called Judaism, around 740 AD.\n\n&gt;Khazaria was reborn on May 14, 1948. \n\nWhere to start, where to start? First off, Samaritanism, is, and has been for years, a different religion to Judaism. Although they use a holy book (the Samaritan Pentateuch) that differs only slightly from the Hebrew Torah, Samaritans (amongst other things) believe that Mount Gerizim is the original Holy Place of Israel, not Jerusalem. These differences are still in place *to this day*. Samaritans are not fake Jews; they are a separated (very small) ethnoreligious group *very similar* to Jews. Khazaria was a real country, and the aristocracy did adopt Judaism around the 8th century (although much of the populace did not convert). However, the idea that modern Jews are both Samaritans (a new one as far as I know) and Khazars (an old one, with a long history), is certainly badhistory.\n\n&gt;New Khazaria would not exist today except for this imaginary Holocaust which served to win them sympathy throughout the world...\n\n&gt;In order to have a JEWISH Holocaust you MUST have Jews....No Jews . . . no Jewish Holocaust....It is not rocket science to figure that out....The real Jews disappeared from history when their task of bringing the Messiah into the world was fulfilled.\n\n&gt;There was no Holocaust of the Khazars either because Satan does not cast out Satan or get rid of his own people. Joshua the Messiah said:\n\n&gt;\"And he called them unto him, and said unto them in parables, How can Satan cast out Satan?\" (Mark 3:23)\n\nIgnoring the fact that this person thinks that Jesus in Mark's Gospel was actually Joshua, who by that point would be hundreds of years old, this is mostly by-the-books anti-Semitism mixed in with what seems to be completely this person's invention. Yes, in order to have a Jewish Holocaust you must have Jews, but there **were** Jews in Europe during World War II, not just migratory Khazars.\n\nI do enjoy the fact that this person both believes that Jews disappeared from history when they brought the Messiah into the world, and that the Messiah was Joshua, so logically it follows that hundreds of years of Jewish history were a couple hundred Samaritans, and Joshua muttering to himself.\n\nThe justification of there being no Holocaust of Khazars being a Bible reference, written nearly two thousand years before the Holocaust happened, is just ignoring the mountains upon mountains of evidence, from accounts by the family of victims, to those who liberated death camps, to pictures of corpses, to senior Nazis actually writing about the genocide. If you need more, you can visit the death camps like Auschwitz, and see the rooms where the Nazis exterminated hundreds, if not thousands of Jews.\n\n&gt;According to the World Almanac and Book of Facts, there were about 15,000,000 \"Jews\" in the world in 1934. According to the same source, there were just about the same number in 1946.\n\nHe then provides us with a table.\n\n\n\nSigh.\n\nThe Problem with the World Almanac is that the 1949 edition (which this person is citing) didn't have access to many new figures, and so the figure was mostly just based upon numbers of Jews from 1938, years before the Holocaust started. So most of the rest of their figures until supplied with new evidence (at which point they changed it) were just slightly adjusted versions of their 1938 figures. You can debate whether neglecting to mention the effect of the Holocaust was malicious or simply negligent, but either way using this as a source is terrible.\n\nThis person just continues to ramble on about Bible verses, Russians, and Constantine being British for a page of badhistory, which I leave as an exercise to the reader. But seriously, you have to read this stuff; it's terrifying.\n\n**TL;DR The Holocaust happened, Jews aren't Samaritans, Joshua isn't Jesus, Khazars don't make up the majority of today's Israel.**\n\nEdit: Shouldn't have used the term 'has always been' when referring to the Samaritans. Also some slight spelling errors.",

        "text": "My grandfather is a massive racist, and as someone who studies race and has an MA in slavery in American history, I thoroughly enjoy it, because it gives me a chance to talk about my field: race and slavery in American history. After he left tonight, my family and I started talking about race and slavery in response to something he said. During the conversation, my brother and father made the analogy between slavery in the 19th century and oil usage today, because both were economic systems on which entire economies are founded. In essence, their argument was: oil is comparable to slavery because both are forms of labor which depend on an outside source of energy which is exploited by those profiting from it. They basically argued that machines had replaced slaves, but the concept was similar.\n\nI'm not sure where to start here, but if I had to choose a starting point, I'm pretty sure it would start with the fundamental difference between a slave, who is a person, and an oil derrick etc., which is a machine. The ethical difference between pretty much literally appropriating a person's life and exploiting a physical resource is major. All this being admitted by my family members (to their credit), the analogy is still pretty terrible because it boils down to \"both exploit something,\" which isn't particularly useful, historically.\n\nOne of my main things about history is the complexity. What we do, essentially, is try to understand the past so that it has a useful impact on the present (emphasis on useful). To say that slavery and oil usage are basically similar because they both depend on a major resource doesn't really prove anything because it's super macro. It also totally ignores that one of these systems literally stole people's lives and caused the biggest armed conflict in America's history. It also ignores that human issues related to slavery are very different from industrial issues. (Future oil wells aren't going to be killed by the police just because they're oil wells, for instance.) While dependence on oil might lead to historical problems, those problems will likely not be similar to the problems caused by American slavery.\n\nAnother issue I see here is that oil wells don't run away, break tools, engage in armed resistance etc., which slaves most certainly did and which historians from Berlin to Foner to Gray have pretty much established at this point. Again, the difference is that slaves were people, whereas machines are not. When I brought this up I was told, \"no, but machines do break.\" Well yes, they do. But they don't willingly break because they were forced into the work they were doing, which is kind of a major difference. Slaves may have \"broken\" by being or pretending to be sick (again, see Deborah Gray White or Ira Berlin on this), but that's not the same as a structural failure unless you're implying that black people are machines. And that's not even taking into account the Civil War. Eric Foner is pretty adamant, for instance that slaves helped end slavery by fighting in the war and sabotaging the South (see The Fiery Trial). Oil wells etc. aren't going to do that sort of thing.\n\ntl;dr: slavery was a human system and oil is an industrial system and the difference is historically relevant. Comparisons between these systems do not take into account the human element which leads to social issues such as the recent protests in Ferguson or intentional sabotage of the entire system which was common in slavery (see Ira Berlin, Eric Foner, Deborah Gray White, etc.). Such issues are very different from issues which are caused by oil consumption because oil consumption doesn't use people's unpaid physical labor as a direct way to produce.",

Admittedly this particular thread is more Nazi fashion apologists (\"1939 looked better!\"), but I thought I'd use this one as a jumping board to do a writeup on the \"Hitler was democratically elected\" myth.\n\n&gt;While this a great image, I don't like the title. Hitler and the Nazis were adored by most Germans and democratically elected to represent the country and its people. I'm not saying Germany was free, it just wasn't exactly being held hostage by a supervillain.\n\n(Oh wow, that was well-timed, I copied the post, refreshed the page, and the guy had deleted his comment. To be fair to him, I don't believe that he was actually a Nazi, just incorrect on the facts.)\n\nEDIT: **DISCLAIMER:**\n\nIt's been pointed out that the process that brought Hitler to power was technically democratic; while Hitler and Hindenburg's actions were very much not in the spirit of democracy, they followed the letter of the law exactly. That said, many people use the argument \"Hitler was popularly elected\" with the idea that Hitler was directly voted in by a majority of the population, like the American President. To rebut that idea specifically, Hitler lost his attempt to be voted Reich President in 1932 by a wide margin; 36.8% of the popular vote to Paul von Hindenburg's 53.0%. After that nobody directly voted for Hitler but instead for his party, which for various reasons won enough seats that Hitler became a possible candidate to be appointed Chancellor, as explained below. I've written this post mostly to get across the process that brought Hitler into power and the backroom dealing that made it possible, since most of the people talking about \"democratically elected\" Hitler don't really know what they're talking about. Special thanks to /u/anonymousssss and /u/Thaddel for pointing out the problems with what I've written.\n\nAnyway, let's unpack this into two sections:\n\n**Hitler was adored by most Germans**\n\nThis is a common one and it's easy to see where people get that idea - the images we have of Nazi Germany usually show large adoring crowds of enthusiastic Nazis. But of course the problem with that is that these images were Nazi propaganda. We have very few images of mass opposition to the regime in part due to its control over imaging and in part due to the fact that such opposition was largely rooted out and destroyed by 1939.\n\nThe truth is, the majority of Germans didn't adore Hitler. ~~The majority of Germans didn't even *like* Hitler.~~ Hitler at his peak popularity never achieved a majority approval rating; the best the NSDAP ever received in free and fair elections was 37.3% of the vote. Even in the last election of the Weimar Republic, which was rife with rigging and voter intimidation, gave the Nazis a result of 43.9%. Hitler received a *plurality* of votes, largely thanks to infighting amongst the Left, but never a *majority*, even when there were literally stormtroopers at the ballot box. (Numbers from Eberhard Kolb, *The Weimar Republic*, but [Wikipedia also has figures that look accurate at first glance.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elections_in_Germany#Weimar_Republic_elections))\n\n**Hitler was democratically elected**\n\nSo the story of how Hitler came to be appointed (emphasis on \"appointed\") Chancellor is actually fascinating, and well described in Henry Ashby Turner Jr.'s *Hitler's Thirty Days to Power*. What I'm going to be giving is a summary, and for more information you should definitely read that book.\n\nThe first thing to understand is the structure of the Weimar Constitution. The Reichstag was a democratically elected Parliamentary system where the party with the largest number of seats formed the government and its leader and his chosen cabinet were appointed by the President as the office of the Chancellor. The President was the elected Head of State and had the authority to dissolve the Reichstag and call a new election. The Reichstag could pass votes of non-confidence against members of the Cabinet, which would force that person to resign.\n\nSo far so standard. This might even be how the current German government works, I'm not sure. But one major wrinkle was Article 48 of the Constitution, which gave the President enormous powers  if \"public order and security were seriously disturbed or endangered.\" Aside from the usual powers of martial law and such, the President was given the power to issue \"Emergency Decrees\" that held the same power as laws passed in the Reichstag.\n\nAs such, enter President Paul von Hindenburg. A WWI War Hero and [a wonderfully stereotypical Junker nobleman](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/11/Bundesarchiv_Bild_183-U0618-0500%2C_Paul_v._Hindenburg.jpg), Hindenburg was elected President in 1925 and re-elected in 1932 (with Adolf Hitler coming in a distant second). Hindenburg was not well sold on this newfangled democracy shtick and the political chaos of the Weimar Republic during the Great Depression did little to change his mind. As such, with the cooperation of members of the Weimar political elite, he created an unofficial system that historians call the \"Presidential Cabinets.\"\n\nThe Presidential Cabinets worked as such: Hindenburg would appoint a Chancellor that he liked, who would in turn propose a Cabinet that toed the careful balance of being acceptable to the President as well as the Reichstag (although of course the President's opinion carried considerably more weight). The Chancellor and Cabinet would go through business as usual, but if they ran into trouble gaining approval for their bills in the Reichstag (which tended to happen more often than not) they would give that bill to the President, who would invoke Article 48 and issue the bill as an Emergency Decree, thus putting it into law without the approval of the Reichstag.\n\nThis was hardly popular with the Reichstag, and added heavily to its already chronic dysfunction. The Weimar was slammed from both the right and the left by the Nazis on the one side and the Communists on the other, and finding somebody willing to put their head in the lion's jaws by accepting the position of Chancellor became increasingly difficult. Add to that Hindenburg's biases (as an old conservative, he would only accept conservative governments) and finding an acceptable Chancellor became a Byzantine endeavour of backroom politicking.\n\nOn 1 June 1932, Franz von Papen was appointed Chancellor. This was largely the work of his future successor, Kurt von Schleicher, who engineered Papen's rise to power as a way to increase his own; Papen was one of Schleicher's friends but, more importantly, something of a political lightweight, who was greatly liked by Hindenburg but not particularly by the Reichstag. After a disastrous 169 days in office, he was booted from the office in disgrace and Schleicher took his place.\n\nThis is where things get interesting. Papen sought revenge against Schleicher for his humiliations. Although a political lightweight, he had the ear of Hindenburg and was a regular visitor to the Presidential house; as Schleicher quickly dug himself into a hole Papen had fertile ground to turn the aging President against the Chancellor. It wasn't long before Hindenburg was more than ready to boot Schleicher, but a new successor had to be found first, which involved approaching the right-wing parties in the Reichstag (don't forget, Hindenburg hated the Left), among which was the NSDAP and its funny-looking leader Adolf Hitler. Hitler was offered a spot in the Cabinet, but refused to cooperate for anything less than the Chancellorship. This was a bold move, because Hindenberg did not like Hitler at all. This was partly due to the 1932 Presidential election, but my understanding is that the two men's personalities just did not mesh. Hindenburg was an old man that enjoyed being coddled, something that Papen was good at; Hitler was aggressive, opinionated, and not good at shutting the fuck up.\n\nIn any case, this was a gamble on Hitler's part, but his all-or-nothing strategy, like many of his plans, somehow paid off; after much back-and-forth Hitler was appointed Chancellor in 1933. Nobody had voted him into the position. He demanded the Reichstag dissolved as part of his appointment and the next election saw the SA standing menacingly at the ballot box. In 1934 Hindenburg passed away at the age of 86, leaving behind a Germany that was increasingly under the grip of the National Socialists; on the same day Hitler merged the offices of Chancellor and President into a title that would go on to be infamous: *Führer*. \n\nKurt von Schleicher was killed in the Night of the Long Knives. Franz von Papen lived out the rest of the war and was acquitted of crimes against peace by the Nuremburg Tribunal, although he did serve several years of hard labour. He died in 1969.",

He is portrayed as some roided out hulk, bald and shaven everywhere for some reason. Is that 'Badass'? This obviously apes '300' the movie so I think that is where it came from. The only bust we have which is supposed to be of Hannibal showed him bearded and looking not so different from Greeks or Romans. However this is still just speculation. In the end we don't, and never will likely, know what Hannibal's appearance was like.\n\nAnyway, Hannibal, though a young man when he invaded Italy, was not shirtless constantly nor was he jacked to the point of Hugh Jackman in the latest Wolverine movie. We cannot say this with absolute certainty but I think it' likely he didn't look like a superhero who just took Bane's 'medication'.  \n\nHe also did not win battles while playing a part in the actual fighting. This show constantly portrays him as some savagely skilled personal warrior in 1-on-1 combat. They seem to forget this guy was blind in one eye for most of the battles and his time in Italy, and that directing these highly skilled maneuvers would be quite difficult with a javelin and sword while in the thick of it. In reality Hannibal led from close behind the fighting line usually in the place he felt most crucial to his hopeful victory, encouraging his men. It would also be quite impossible to issue precise orders of movement to parts of his army and concerning time (for which Hannibal is so famous) if he was muckin' it up on the front lines like Alexander The Great.\n\nAlso as a last parting tidbit Hannibal never took an oath to destroy Rome or even take revenge against it. He supposedly took an oath \"never to be a friend of the Romans\". Which is quite different from 'they must be destroyed' as Cato The Elder would later proclaim the fate of Carthage. \n\nEdit: My main source for this is Adrian Goldsworthy's *The Punic Wars*, and a biography of Hannibal which I read but can't retrieve just now because my Dad is asleep where the book is and I can't  remember the author's name.\n\nEDIT 2 Just because I wanna talk: Hannibal led from just behind the center in the thin forward arch formation at Cannae. He did this likely because he knew this was the most important place in the battle, though all aspects were important as well. He knew that this thin line must fight hard and hold against the onslaught of the Romans deep maniples. He knew this thin line could not win against the Roman onslaught, but the struggle must be convincing. Therefore when the superior Roman massed center began to break Hannibal's line, they legitimately thought they were winning the battle because of the ferociousness of the resistance they thought they were overcoming. When the Carthaginian army began to break and flee the Romans understandably began to pursue with enthusiasm to massacre their opponents. Only then did Hannibal give the order for the wings of his formation, the heavy African Infantry (the only part of his army really on par with that of the stout Roman infantry) to turn inward and advance. Now the Romans were hit in both flanks simultaneously. Later, Hannibal's cavalry returned after their earlier shattering charge of Rome's cavalry and their subsequent pursuit and chasing them from the battlefield. This was the nail in the coffin. The cavalry hit the Romans in the rear. Now the iron circle had closed, the trap sprung. The Romans were utterly doomed. Most fought valiantly supposedly, but they had no alternative but to struggle for the last desperate inch or give up and die. The picture of the injured, dead, or dying men here is horrifying and it's hard to imagine worse scenes of slaughter until perhaps the Second World War. It took hours for Hannibal's men to complete their work. Men screaming after being cut down, slashed in the back of the legs so they could not run. Some begging for water as the sun had bore down on them. Others begging for their lives undoubtedly, in vain trying to convince the Carthaginian's they were of use (some defectors were of course accepted and spared). But most probably were begging to be quickly put out of their misery. It probably took the Carthaginian Army several hours to oblige all of them. \n\nThis picture is a far more terrifying picture of Hannibal than some muscle bound shirtless asshole doing ridiculous unbelievable swordplay for popular TV.  \n\n",

        "text": "So as usual when [a picture of Nazi Germany makes it to the front page](http://np.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/2q6j61/nazi_germany_vs_free_germany/), Nazi apologists sprout up like mushrooms in shit. Admittedly this particular thread is more Nazi fashion apologists (\"1939 looked better!\"), but I thought I'd use this one as a jumping board to do a writeup on the \"Hitler was democratically elected\" myth.\n\n&gt;While this a great image, I don't like the title. Hitler and the Nazis were adored by most Germans and democratically elected to represent the country and its people. I'm not saying Germany was free, it just wasn't exactly being held hostage by a supervillain.\n\n(Oh wow, that was well-timed, I copied the post, refreshed the page, and the guy had deleted his comment. To be fair to him, I don't believe that he was actually a Nazi, just incorrect on the facts.)\n\nAnyway, let's unpack this into two sections:\n\n**Hitler was adored by most Germans**\n\nThis is a common one and it's easy to see where people get that idea - the images we have of Nazi Germany usually show large adoring crowds of enthusiastic Nazis. But of course the problem with that is that these images were Nazi propaganda. We have very few images of mass opposition to the regime in part due to its control over imaging and in part due to the fact that such opposition was largely rooted out and destroyed by 1939.",
