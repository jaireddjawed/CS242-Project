        "text": "There is currently a lot of focus among progressives in trying to raise the minimum wage. For instance, Bernie Sanders and 29 other senators introduced a $15 minimum wage bill to the house last year. Similarly, many cities around the country such as San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Seattle have all passed ordinances to increase the minimum wage. The main argument behind most of these proposals is that the cost of living has increased and thus we have to increase the minimum wage in order for the minimum wage to become a living wage.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, couldn't we achieve a \"living wage\" by instead focusing on reducing the cost of living? In particular, we could probably focus our efforts on decreasing the cost of housing, higher education, and health care. It definitely seems like there is a lot of open opportunity in this space. For example, lower housing costs could probably be achieved through increased building and more efficient regulation (such as reducing parking requirements). Higher education costs could probably be reduced by offering online degrees from public universities. Health care costs could probably be lowered by bargaining more with drug companies and increasing the supply of doctors.  There are also many other potential cost savings methods that I didn't even include in that short list.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGiven that we have several promising methods for reducing the cost of living and that many people are interested in making the minimum wage a living wage, why don't we see many politicians (and progressives) championing efforts to decrease the cost of living? It seems like many of these potential solutions are much cheaper and easier with fewer potential downsides than raining the minimum wage.  We have people striking to increase the minimum wage to $15. Why don't we have people striking to build more apartments to reduce the cost of living?",

But no one wanted to precipitate a constitutional crisis.\n\nArticle 4 of [the 25th Amendment](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxxv) states:\n\n&gt; Whenever the Vice President and a **majority** of either **the principal officers of the executive departments** or of such other body as Congress may by law provide, transmit to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives their written declaration that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office, the Vice President shall immediately assume the powers and duties of the office as Acting President.\n\nThen, it gets complicated. Basically, Trump would then be put on ice for about three weeks while Congress debates removal (requiring a two-thirds majority vote in both Houses).\n\nThe [Principal Officers of Trump’s Executive Departments](https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-trump-administration/the-cabinet/) are:\n\n1. State - Mike Pompeo\n2. Treasury - Steve Mnuchin\n3. Defense - James Mattis\n4. Attorney General — Jeff Sessions\n5. Homeland Security - Kirstjen Nielsen\n6. Health &amp; Human Services - Alex Azar\n7. HUD - Ben Carson\n8. Energy - Rick Perry\n9. Labor - Alexander Acosta\n10. Transportation - Elaine Chao\n11. Education - Betsy DeVos\n12. Interior - Ryan Zinke\n13. Commerce - Wilbur Ross\n14. Agriculture - Sonny Perdue\n15. Veterans Affairs - Robert Wilkie\n16. US Trade Rep. -  Robert Lighthizer\n17. UN Rep. -  Nikki Haley\n18. Management &amp; Budget - Mick Mulvaney\n19. EPA -  Andrew Wheeler\n20. Small Business - Linda E. McMahon\n\nWhich eleven executive officers would be most likely to support the use of the Twenty-Fifth?\n\nHow would Trump respond to such a challenge? \n\nHow might it be challenged in the court? (The interpretation of the phrase “unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office” seems key to me)\n\nShould Congress decline removal, could the Cabinet simply do it all over again when Trump resumes office?\n\n\n",

Palestinian activists, Legal experts, The draft writer of the IHRA definition itself argue otherwise. (in fact even May's own home office added clarifications to the IHRA definition which seemingly has been swept under the rug).\n\nThe question is, does the IHRA examples regarding Israel, stifle Pro-Palestinian activism and have a silencing effect on Pro-Palestinian activists?",
