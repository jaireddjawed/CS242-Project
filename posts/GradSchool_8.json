I have many years (2 decades) experience in communication, including science communication. I am playing with the idea of perhaps set up online MOOCs for PhD students and young scholars who would like to learn how to disseminate their research to a wider audience. \n\nI am just not sure whether this is a path worth pursuing - if there is “a market”, so to speak. So I’m taking my chance here (and I promise if you answer and I decide to try this, I will never hassle you to participate just because I asked on Reddit once…) - would this be interesting? \n\nGosh, this does sound like disguised selling, it really isn’t.

However, I am also frequently being tasked with editing and drafting major grant applications for the lab (2-3/grant season), which is laborious and definitely reduces my personal research/lab time. I also oversee honours students and coordinate summer student projects as well. I am routinely expected to take meetings/work on grants over the weekend as well. \n\nIs this appropriate/normal? I have a tough time saying no when it comes to requests from my supervisor, but I feel at times I am also taking on the role of an RA or RC at times. I am concerned my degree timeline is being pushed back and question whether I need to be setting more defined work and work-life boundaries. Thanks in advance for the advice!",

Should I purchase an official translator/translation service to do the translation? (As listed in the university website)Or should I wait until the mid of March? Or should I email my potential supervisors of such situation? From my prior experiences, official translation from University would be quite eligible but I am wondering how many weeks do admissions of UK universities usually take?\n\nThanks so much for reading my message!

Nor did the historiography seminar paper I completed for another class (different professor) get returned with any feedback, despite an email request. \nMy other advisor, whom I work for as a research assistant, briefly talks to me about ideas but our conversations skew back towards their work 75% of the time. \n\nI’ve been reading endlessly, it seems, and have a clearer idea of where I want to take my argument.

That's not why I'm here.\n\nI started grad school when everywhere was remote on Zoom (I'm in the U.S). We did that for a few semesters, and then we were in person with masks. I'm extremely pro-mask, but it didn't make people hyped to stick around and chat. After that, we were in-person no masks, with select classes on Zoom to this day.\n\nI have made one single friend in my entire time in grad school. And even she's gotten distant to the point where I don't think we're friends. I smile, I always make the WhatsApp study groups (maybe 3/20 people ever join), and I make people laugh in class. I feel like I can keep up intellectually with my peers (or at least I fake it well!).\n\nWhat the fuck is wrong with me? I have a visible disability (a very, very severe stutter), but I'm old enough to not think that's why people don't want to be my friend - it's moreso the person it's turned *me* into. Not to mention, grad school is about making connections; I've only done that with professors. I went to a house party a few semesters ago, it was great! I just wish I'd known at the time that that was the best it was gonna get.\n\nHas anyone managed to salvage a social grad experience at the last minute?",

I'm in the US for context.\n\nI did a plus-one BS/master's at a different, similarly well ranked school. I loved the research I was doing with my MS advisor. It was interesting and definitely something I could see myself continuing to research. I also got along really well with the professor.\n\nWhen I was applying to PhD programs, I had faculty interviews with two professors at this school, Alex and Bob (pseudonyms), where I presented the research I had been doing. The two profs were both interested in advising me, and were assigned to be co-mentors, with Bob as the \"main\" mentor. Advisor decisions are not binding in year one.\n\nBob and I did not end up working well together, at all. He was dead set on an incredibly niche research area that I wasn't at all interested in, and our working styles did not click. Within just six weeks, we ended up having a major argument that resulted in us quietly severing professional ties. Alex became my primary mentor.\n\nAlex was much easier to work with and did research that was slightly more interesting, but still not anything close to what I discussed during the interview or what I highlighted as collaboration opportunities. I proposed some of those ideas again, and she told me very bluntly that they were nonviable in terms of funding and publication worthiness, and suggested some other work that I was wholly uninterested in doing.\n\nI'm beginning to think that the profs here saw that I was talented in a specific low-volume area and poached me to work on *their* research projects with my skills, and misrepresented what kinds of projects we could do during the interview phase. I'm frustrated because I got the impression across both interviews that my research experience would be similar to the awesome things I was doing during my masters.\n\nI spoke with the associate dean of the department and I'm currently struggling to find a new lab/advisor during admission season (yikes) and with a niche skillset that is not really transferable (yikes 2). I have a fellowship through the end of December of this year but I have nothing secured beyond that. We're supposed to have an advisor by the 1 year mark and an accepted publication by the 2 year mark, and I haven't even begun research yet after a semester and a half.\n\nWhat the heck should I do? I'm seriously debating dropping out of the program when the fellowship dries up if I'm not in a place where I'm doing research I'm happy with. But even with a masters in CS I have no work experience and can't actually program very well since I am more on the math side, so the prospect of quitting and trying to force my way into industry at a disadvantage without stable income is terrifying. Does anyone have advice for ways to help stabilize after a very rocky waste of a year one?",

However, as a biomed major, I’d have to be doing the masters as an MSc in Biology, rather than MSc in CS. How transferable is this to industry, provided I’m okay with another 1-year MSc in (bio)statistics/data science if needed? Alternate plan is to do an accelerated BSc in CS.\n\nHey everyone. I finished my Bachelor’s in Biomedical Science in Canada, and for a year after graduation, had worked in wet lab research. [After taking the time to explore my careers and interests](https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/108ln1t/computer_science_biostatistics_health_informatics/), I was planning on doing an accelerated bachelor’s in CS + a master's in biostatistics. Through this, my goal was to do research using data science within a biomedical/clinical context, while also having robust credentials for industry if things go awry.\n\nHowever, I recently got offered a fully-funded Master’s position by one of my professors. They are primarily appointed in the CS department, with research in ML for drug discovery, cancer biology, etc. The project aligns very well with my interests, however, as my current credentials are in biomedical science (not CS), he is only able to offer the position through a Master's in Biology, as opposed to a Master's in CS.\n\nThat being said:\n\n* How transferrable would this MSc in Biology be towards the general CS/DS/ML industry? \n* Overall, provided my interests, would this be a wise decision career-wise?\n\nI’m also fine with doing another internship-based MSc in (bio)statistics or data science after this program, if need be (e.g. if the MSc in Bio isn’t recognized). I would have enrolled in those directly if it weren’t for missing prerequisite courses (which I plan on taking in the BSc in CS or MSc in Bio).",

We share an office, take two mandatory classes together, and he goes to nearly every event there is. \n\nI have since developed PTSD. It makes it really difficult to even go to campus sometimes because even the threat of simply running into him in the hallways is enough to make me feel violently ill. \n\nSo, you get what I’m saying. I’ve been avoiding department-sponsored events for a couple of months now because it’s just so difficult to be near him, especially when none of our mutual friends believe me and still adore him and gravitate toward him, leaving me with no support system. \n\nDo professors notice my absence as much as everyone on Reddit says they do? I feel like I haven’t even gotten the chance to meet most of the professors yet, so why do they care about where I am at what times? The most recent events I’ve had to miss are a series of job talks where the main purpose is to hire a new creative writing professor. I’m a literature track student, so it’s not even really relevant to me, but I keep finding myself struggling with the pressure to be there because “your professors always note your absence” and the intense dread of being there because he IS a creative writer, so he’s almost guaranteed to be there. \n\nI just don’t want to be regarded as lazy or anti-social because of one horrible thing that just so happened to have happened to me around Christmas. Should I just get over it and make myself go to things? \n\nThanks in advance.",

But I am realizing I have totally fucked over my academic career and my life more broadly. 3.98 GPA in the humanities - I pissed off one prof and got an A-. Already off to a bad start, then - even if I did get it together later and avoid this person now.\n\nOkay, let's see what I've done. A mentored fellowship that made me realize my OG mentor was not who I wanted to work with. A couple of conferences every year,  which is fair enough but conferences don't mean anything on a resume. Good teaching recs my second year, a language grant my third year, a fellowship to do coursework in France. I can't judge how impressive any of that is on a resume but it really seems like underperformance to me.\n\nWorst of all, I have 0 publications. It's useless to go over the excuses - coursework, health, whatever. None of that matters and frankly is insulting to the people who are also working full-time jobs, dealing with illnesses, supporting their families, and are still doing life-changing research. At this point it is going to look pathetic for me to publish- just the amount and the time it would take to get stuff out there. It's fine in theory, but it'll look desperate on the CV to have 2 or 3 things coming out while I'm writing the diss.\n\nI know at this point it's too late for me to have a CV strong enough for the job market. It's just as unlikely that I'll have any good transferable skills to a non-academia career path. Anyone can teach, consult, write, whatever without a degree they used to be an anxious, useless piece of shit. It's just hard realizing I am the one who has ruined my entire life, and has nothing to offer except leeching off of family and friends until I die in the street.",

I have a colleague attempting her Ph.D. doing literally 1 or 2 classes per semester, but it's for a seminary degree.  I'm hoping for a school/program/methodology with similar flexibility while maintaining reasonable costs.\n\nI suppose I could forego the degree and just take individual classes through some sort of training camp/business, but 1) I'm uncertain about the quality of the courses existing outside of a formal university, 2) the structure of a formal program seems like it would make the material easier to follow and digest, and 3) seems like a bit of a waste to go through it all without the final recognition.\n\nJust looking for any suggestions/feedback/thoughts anyone would like to share on this, thanks.",

I had acquired a first Masters degree in Applied Behavior Analysis and realized that while appreciated a lot of what I had learned, it wasn’t for me. This sent me in a different direction towards the MSW which I wholeheartedly love. \n\nIt’s my second year of grad school within this program and I’m estimated to finish in December of 2023. While going to grad school I have no choice but to work full time. I was lucky enough to be able to do my internship at my worksite. This worked out so well until I realized that I’m still dealing with a narcissistic boss with possible borderline personality disorder. \n\nWhen I first started there, I was thrust into an investigation regarding this boss because people had made comments about how inappropriate she was and the derogatory comments she would make about people. I had heard her say these things and confirmed with HR. Many people have left because of her. The result of that whole experience was she probably got a slap on the wrist at best. The executive director loves her (for whatever reason) and she will remain. Okay that’s fine. \n\nThis job was flexible for school and worked out well for that. I focused on my stuff, stay off a radar, that type of thing. Well last week took a turn for the unimaginable worst. \n\nI am a program director in this place but do therapist work for the internship part. One of the clients in my program died. We didn’t know about it only because 1.) he was always on drug binges and had been recently kicked out of his group home with no new housing secured and 2.) we didn’t even have current billing to provide services even though we were constantly reaching out to be paid. Sad situation but those were valid reasons. \n\nAnyways, my boss makes a huge deal of this situation, blaming school of the reason I didn’t know. She then gets HR involved. HR originally is like I’m going to investigate this clients death. Once I speak to HR it starts out about the death of the client to you aren’t doing your job and now I think your a fraud and unethical and HR is going to investigate you and your entire program! I was backed into a corner. \n\nI’ve been waiting a week for this bs investigation to be done with. Normally, I would have quit because my boss is toxic to work with. However, my internship is there. Should I let my fieldwork instructor know? To let her know I’m potentially being fired mid-semester? And I don’t know what to do about another placement? I don’t know if this will be a  for sure termination but trying to be proactive about my internship. This whole situation is trivial. \n\nThank you for listening to this crazy rant. For real, if I didn’t have the internship there, I would have been gone a long time ago.",

I’m certain that I want to pursue a PhD in a year/couple years, and I have professors I’d like to work with already in mind.\n\nI’m currently a senior graduating this spring with a STEM degree - in the physical sciences in particular. I feel that if I take a couple years to do research I will be a much more competitive applicant for top graduate school programs in my field.\n\nI’ve noticed that the only pre-doc positions I find are in economics or some sort of pre-med program. How do I find a pre-doc program to be a part of in the physical sciences? Do I just cold email several professors to ask if they have funding? Any help would be appreciated!",

I also am only attending part time and work in the arts and entertainment industry, so I’m definitely not the “typical” student in my program. I largely get the feeling this would be looked down upon by most of my peers, so I keep it minimal and not really visible. However, I’m also in a program geared towards public sector work primarily so I’m sure that factors in (I’d actually like to stay working in entertainment/music, since MPA students sometimes go/stay corporate).\n\nI’m curious how most graduate students view recreational substance use and if they partake themselves, and curious if this varies significantly by field of study.",

        "text": "This past semester I’ve become a part time graduate student (working full time). Things have been a bit stressful but so far manageable.\n\nAt the end of last week my professor decided to schedule an online midterm from March 1-2 (we have a 48 hour window to take the exam). But in some weird twist of fate i happen to have a field test demo for my work during this time and  it can’t be pushed back since it has been on the calendar for about a month now. The 2 are in conflict.\n\nI emailed my professor asking if I could take the exam on a later day due to this conflict and  for some more information on the exam, and his response was that I should talk to my manager about dropping this course because other activities are in conflict with it and I should consider putting in the the effort of the other students.\n\nLuckily my manager allowed me to spend the 2nd taking the exam so provided the weather doesn’t go to shit I’ll still have a day to take the exam.\n\nThat being said: Is it common for professors to be this unreasonable in a graduate program? Or is his response completely valid? I’m more worried for a time where I can’t get out of a conflict like this\n\nI guess ultimately my issue wasn’t that the professor didn’t allow me to make up the exam (as I can understand how that might be unfair and I was thankfully able to find a work around). My issue is that his response comes off as a rude. Not only did he not answer any of my questions about the exam information, but he’s effective implying that his class takes priority over everything else and that I’m putting in less effort (which I’m not, with the exception of the past 3-4 lectures I’ve been attending class, studying and doing the homework). I’m not an undergraduate student anymore! Yes I took this class because I want to learn, but I do have other responsibilities now. I dunno is this an overreaction?\n\nWhat are your guy’s thoughts?",

I graduated with a BSc back in 2012 so there will likely be courses I'll need to retake which is fine. I'm looking through admission requirements and most, if not all, state that at least one of the references is from someone in an academic faculty position. How would you guys suggest I go about building a professional relationship with a professor to be able to get a reference?  \n\nMany thanks!",
