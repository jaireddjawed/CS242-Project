        "text": "I was thinking about the presence of critical art appreciation (or lack thereof) while I was at lunch today browsing /r/Art, the default subreddit for creative submissions on the site. It seems to me that, for a website with as much content being cycled as reddit has, there's a disproportionately small amount of strong contemporary art being posted or discussed. What art there is seems primarily to be easily categorized into a few general categories, often with an overlap between two or more:\n\n1. exercises in manual technical precision, such as photorealistic pencil, digital or oilpaint renderings.\n\n2. referential pop culture illustrations, such as depictions of batman, video game characters, and the ubiquitous calvin and hobbes murals.\n\n3. one-liner pseudoconceptual works, where the piece speaks to nothing deeper than its own punny self referentiality.\n\n4. mainstream high art, most commonly late impressionist through 20th century pop-era pieces that would be included a high school level art history survey (this primarily includes formalist representational work and not abstract or conceptual movements.)\n\nTheres nothing inherently wrong about work that fits any of these criteria, however considering the scale of the reddit community one might expect to see a larger representation of art with deeper critical value. Yet whenever i visit smaller subreddits devoted to more advanced art discussion, more often than not they're dead zones, often with the highest rated post having less than 50 upvotes and almost no comments. Meanwhile, the average critical debate on /r/Art and the rare post in /r/pics  borderlines on completely superficial, with debates more likely to focus on picking apart technique than unpacking the concept behind the work.\n\nOne possible reason I see for this is reddit's general disdain for art theory as a profession, as is evident in the often repeated joke about art school graduates' inevitable track towards working at a Starbucks. Another reason I could see for the state of things might lie in the fact that the high art world is notoriously bad at web publishing, and therefore generally unadvertised to most reddit users who don't have real world connections to the art world at large.\n\nWhat might some other systemic conditions be prohibiting a higher level of arts conversation on reddit, and what could be done to address it from the perspective of contemporary practicing artists looking to foster a stronger community here?",

        "text": "For a little bit of background here, I like to check the site wide awards page daily, because it usually has some interesting content that I missed.  \n\nwww.reddit.com/awards\n\nThe main four awards that I check are Best Link, Best Comment, Inciteful Link, and Inciteful Comment.  The awards aren't archived anywhere, so I decided to start doing that on my own.  I made /r/reddittrophies for this purpose  (**edit**  I made a wiki for easier navigation:  http://www.reddit.com/r/RedditTrophies/wiki/index  **/edit**).  After I started paying attention for a few days, I noticed that there were some interesting trends, so I decided to start tracking the awards to see if there were any more trends I was missing.\n\nThis is what I have over the last month:  http://imgur.com/a/9DMCC\n\nI think it's interesting to note that the Inciteful Link is usually some sort of sob story or Facebook-esque post in /r/pics or /r/funny.\n\nInciteful Comment and Best Comment are almost always in /r/askreddit, which makes sense due to the size and nature of that subreddit.  A comment in that sub is most likely to be seen by the most people.\n\nIt's also possible for Inciteful Comment to have been downvoted into the negatives.\n\nBest Link seems to be mostly in /r/pics, although /r/technology generates a significant number as well.\n\nSometimes the Inciteful Link/Comment has been removed by the mods, so the award goes to [deleted].\n\nCombo Commenter has been won 17% of the time by a celebrity doing an AMA, which is lower than I expected before I counted.\n\nWell Rounded has been won 80% of the time by an account with greater than 100k karma in either link or comment category.  This would basically be the Redditors who are successful at earning karma, and are probably on Reddit a significant amount of the time.\n\nThe awards page seems to be updated partially in real time, such as the Gilding awards and the New User award, and partially manually, such as the awards listed above.\n\nThe \"cake day\" award is sometimes won by an account that has been shadow banned.\n\nThoughts?\n\n**edit** About winning the awards, some of this is speculation:\n\n * Best Link/Comment:  Self explanatory.  Most successful link/comment site wide by karma.\n\n * Combo Linker/Commenter:  More than 1 link/comment, with the highest average karma.  It's possible that only the top 2 links/comments are taken into consideration.\n\n * Inciteful Link/Comment:  I have no idea.  It might be upvote/downvote ratio, or it may have to cross a threshold of total votes.\n\n * Well-Rounded:  Most successful award.  Sum total of both link and comment karma earned in a day.  The award goes to whomever has the highest low of the two.  In my opinion, this is the easiest one to win.\n\n * Bellwether:  This one is won by correctly voting, I think.  The wording of this award was changed about 2 years ago, but I think the algorithm stayed the same.  Upvote stuff that ends up on the front page, downvote stuff that goes nowhere.  It's more about predicting the success of the submission that you're voting on.",

[source](http://redd.it/28hjga) Reddit users did not take kindly to the change, and the majority seemed to want to undo the change.\nIt is, however, still possible to determine the number of upvotes and downvotes on posts by using simple math, like so:\n \nwhere x is the number of upvotes and y is the number of downvotes,\n \nx ≥ 0\n \ny ≥ 0\n \nx - y = a(the number of points)\n \nx / (x + y) = b(the % upvoted)\n \nSince a and b are both given, it's quite simple to solve for x and y.\n \nRemember that this might not be *perfectly* accurate, but for the vast majority of cases it should be more than accurate enough. \n \nLet's take the [current top post](http://redd.it/2pzy03) on the front page as an example. At the time of my post, it has 3,417 points with a 95% upvote rate. If you plug that in;\n \nx ≥ 0\n \ny ≥ 0\n \nx - y = 3417\n \nx / (x + y) = 0.95\n \nyou can [graph](https://www.desmos.com/calculator) the equations and inequalities to easily find the values of x and y which satisfy all four of these equations and inequalities.\n \n[screenshots](http://imgur.com/a/aVmCZ)\n \nThe coordinates of the point where the two lines intersect are the values for x and y, hence, our upvotes and downvotes. In our example, the number of upvotes is 3607 and the number of downvotes is 190.",

        "text": "I was reading a comment someone posted here on a thread a couple of months ago regarding a thread that he made on a sub which got downvoted only after he started losing to a debate within his own post. At first, he said, he had got upvotes on his comments because the post that he made was relevant and the next thing you know, some redditors attacked him for killing the sub or something and all his [even rational] comments were downvoted to oblivion. It got me thinking; why do people shift their stance so easily on a subject? \n\nThen it struck me; The psychology behind the people on reddit is very.....umm...soft, is not exactly what I mean but certainly not bold. Why? Because reddit's system of reward and punishment does not physically or emotionally [if you are not a karma-whore] affect you. However, even people that are karma-whores won't really hang on to their points very long because eventually from longer experience, they will feel that their reward is nothing more than a pat on the back, and they will follow the bandwagon. Reddit's voting system costs you **nothing**. Even more so, when they don't see you face to face, they won't feel emotionally attached to their actions. As long as it doesn't cost you anything valuable, you will do it; [courtesy of this social experiment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBuC_0-d-9Y). So, I have an idea.\n\nIt's a social experiment here on reddit. I will start a giant thread where I will show you the number of comments and the reasons behind each comment. Then, I will post a couple of respective comments, preferably not too long but very straightforward and I will ask you to downvote it only if you have a strong claim to do so i.e. justify your actions in a comment below it. To keep this under control, we'll have to contact the mods and ask for one of them to actively moderate the thread to keep the number of testers under control. I prefer 15-20 redditors for the control. Test time: 30min-1h. Once the control is done, we'll do another uncontrolled exact one the next day but the number of testers is up to who sees the thread and likes to join in. Time is flexible. \n\nFor the control, I would like people to \"sign up\" for it simply by pledging that they will show up to the test and leaving their usernames by the controlling mod. \n\nMy Mission: To better understand the society that I want to live in. At least for people growing up in my generation.\n\nIf you like this idea and like to contribute to it, feel free. ",

Tipping waitresses? Fuck that they don't need handouts they're doing fine. (before anyone looks at my account age this is an alt my main is 2 years old nearly)\n\nI'm not like that anymore.

Every single comment is people jumping to huge conclusions saying that Coca Cola paid for this to hit the front page. The whole thing turned into a paranoid debate on how reddit is becoming an advertising hot spot. The comments are ridiculously insane something I'd expect people with schizophrenia to write.\n\n/r/HailCorporate is a huge thing in this product paranoia problem.\n\nWhat's the psychology behind this? Does it have something to do with ego? Worrying about being out smarted by these corporations? I think it's weird they're so worried about all of this when they all end up buying the product they're being cynical about anyway.

If anyone complained about the bans above, they'd just be laughed at. In my experience at least, redditors react much worse to bans than people from 4chan. You have to be clear and civil when banning on reddit, and even still you get met with complaints, stalking, etc from disgruntled users. \n\n**Why I think it is like this:**\n\nI think it comes down to 2 things, anonymity and entitlement. Mods on 4chan are as anonymous as the users, you have no username to pin your ban to, no face to get mad at. On entitlement, while both reddit and 4chan have/had emphasis on free speech, they went about it in different ways. Reddit is advertised as a haven of free speech, while giving mod tools for people to create their own community with limited speech. Users come in feeling entitled to be able to say anything, and they feel reddit is more professionally run. 4chan is advertised more a hole (or whatever the opposite of haven is) of free speech. 4chan is also advertised as a lot more shady. \n\nSo, by comparing these differences, I think it comes down to what users expect from what they are shown. And they expect professionalism from mods in most subreddits. \n",

The project is called Rule Perspectives and Rule Breaking Among Active Internet Users and it looks at moral acceptability and behavioural tendencies to engage in certain actions on the internet. \n\nI think that this study promotes interesting sociological discussion on the social impacts of technology on people's thoughts and behaviours. Do you guys think that the internet has the ability to change how you act and feel? Do you think that you may do things online that you would never do offline? Do you think there is such thing as an online 'self' (Mead, Cooley, Higgins, Goffman, Rogers, Baumeister). What would be the social implications for interpersonal interactions in cyberspace, cyber-crime, or cyber-bullying? These are some questions that I am investigating for this study. We can discuss some of these things in this thread and the study may help shed more light into such questions. I can definitely share the results of this study next year when I am finished writing the dissertation. Seeing as this is r/TheoryOfReddit, do you also think that Reddit would lead to different changes than just participation in general cyberspace?\n\nOk, so this is an academic survey that takes about 20-25 minutes to complete, but hopefully it is interesting enough to keep you engaged throughout. Eligible participants are those who are over 18 years of age. Please feel free to send the link to anyone who might interested or even post it on social media.\n\nHere is the link: https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/rulebreakinguwo\n\nThanks so much you beautiful people and lets talk about the sociology of the internet and Reddit!\n",

        "text": "For a long time I've stayed away from voting because I considered it biased. How should you vote? You should upvote high quality content and downvote low quality content. If we separate content from what we think is high quality from content that consists of cheap feel-good jokes and memes then we should upvote informative posts and downvote memes. Casual users seem to upvote what makes them feel good, not high quality posts, which leads to the lowest-common-denominator humour on the front page, and which leads to pun threads and jokes derailing meaningful discussion. Should we vote in a way to correct for that? I think so but I could be wrong.\n\nThat's okay, but there's more:\n\nIf you are just voting on posts as you see them, then you are being biased by content that is presented to you. I think there's a sort of boost effect given to front-page posts. It's not like there are a thousand posts and people see a random section of them and upvote/downvote accordingly, they instead see the posts that others have already been upvoted, unless they specifically look for other posts. That means if there's a funny joke and a funnier joke, the funnier joke would get a slight advantage, and then would be seen more. Then the funnier joke would get a greater advantage and more upvotes just by being seen more than the funny joke. The front page would be full of these. Does that mean that to correct for it, we should downvote popular posts to make room for other content?\n\nAnd a third question:\n\nThe voting opportunities that occur as we browse (upvoting/downvoting posts we see as we see them) don't actually make that big of a difference. We are voting to influence the site though, not to feel good about ourselves, we do it because we want to filter content by quality, that's the point of voting. Therefore, if that's the goal, shouldn't we find better ways to influence the content on the site? Rather than voting on submissions we see, we can make a greater impact by ignoring the submissions we see, and then going to a '/new' section and upvoting/downvoting there. Votes on new submissions matter much more, so if we are actually voting to influence the site, we should vote there. Do you agree?\n\nA fourth question:\n\nTime spent deciding on voting. If we are voting on submissions we see, and if we should do it well, then some time would be spent thinking. That time will be spent thinking only about posts we are exposed to, that get presented to us. That means that if there are a thousand new posts, and we only see about fifty of them, and those fifty are seen because others have upvoted them, then we are falling into the same trap as earlier. If we wanted to vote on a lot of submissions and not fall into this bias, then we should expose ourselves to posts that we don't usually see and then find a way to rate a lot of posts in a short amount of time. For example, we can say with some certainty that most posts on /r/adviceanimals are not quality posts. They make people laugh but they aren't quality posts. However, posts on /r/truescience probably are, I've never been to that subreddit before today, I just visited it now to see if it's a real subreddit, but with little research we can conclude that the posts on that subreddit probably are high quality posts. They are /r/science posts, but for people who care enough about reddit that they think it has strayed, and therefore they created /r/truescience. Therefore, to be able to vote on a better share of submissions, it makes sense to me to go into /r/adviceanimals/new and downvote every post visible, without looking at them, and then to go to /r/truescience/new and upvote every post, without looking at them. We might make a mistake here or there but the overall impact would be positive and maximized. This might violate spam rules, but other than that, do you agree that a strategy similar to this one would be one of the best to influence the site's quality?\n\nEdit: It looks like /r/truescience isn't very active, it was just an example, you can replace it with another subreddit that you think is likely to have a lot of high-quality posts\n\nEdit2: I got some criticism on using /r/truescience as an example, just imagine another subreddit, that's the first that came to my head when I was writing it.",

Those lists are long, and they're accurate and good at pointing out how repetitive some comments are, but I was thinking of categorizing the type of humour. That way if you have two front-page posts that at first glance seem different, you can point out that it's the exact same type of post.\n\nI feel like listing examples but I don't want to, they would be similar to the tropes on tvtropes.  \nFor example you can have variations of 'unexpected' end jokes where someone writes a paragraph about something and the last few sentences trail off into something made to surprise the reader, often times the username will describe the ending.  \nAnother one is direct vulgar humour, 'ironically' offensive type stuff.  \nAnother one is some sort of 'cute' humour, like posting a picture of a small animal with text describing what the animal might be saying (e.g. the young version of insanity wolf, that picture of a small crab saying something about being the Kraken).  \nAnother one is direct reference humour, as in taking a few words from a comment and referencing a common meme (e.g. broken arms story)  \nAnother one is repetitive words (Tom Cruise, ayy lmao, Darude Sandstorm)  \nAnother one is self-referential image macros, which might fall into one of the above. For example the 'awkward seal' posts that describe awkward situations that a seal might be in, not a human. Or 'confession bears' about eating campers\n\nThere are a lot of them and I'm sure there are overlapping themes between them, I feel like we could put them into buckets.",

        "text": "I found myself in a little debate about Karma Whores, and this brought me back to comparing the original intent of Reddit compared to what it effectively became:\n\n* The original plan was that everyone contributes to Reddit what they find interesting. Upvotes and downvotes were there to rank these contributions by public interest, and karma was a measurement of how much benefit a user contributed to the community. By and large contribution to the community was an end in itself - we see that people share our interest and like what we do, and it satisfies us. We do not receive any direct return value like money - we only receive return through the social benefit. By contributing to Reddit and this way making it a better place, more and better content will come back to us.\n\n* Karma whores start by the other end: Karma is the goal. Contribution is just the annoying work to get to that goal. This means we get low quality content: fawning on the mainstream opinions instead of challenging or contributing to them  in a constructive way. Reposts. Click-bait titles that often missrepresent the content.\n\nIn comparison, the Marxist theory of Money Fetishism:\n\n* Money has no use value, only exchange value - you cannot eat it or dress in it, but you can exchange it for food or clothing. Money is just the expression of value of the commodities it can be exchanged for. $3 can be the expression of the value of a hamburger for example. The hamburger has value because it has use value (it feeds us and has a certain taste) and because it required work to create it (in comparison, ordinary air has no value to it because it is available without work).\n\n\n* The Fetishism is that people start considering money to be the substance of the commodities - $3 look to us as if they *were* a hamburger, so to say. $3 look to us as if they could feed us on their own. So we start hoarding it.\n\nTo come back to karma from this perspective:\n\n* Karma is only a representation of the value of our contribution to the community.\n\n* Karma fetishism is to pursue karma as an end in itself.\n\nIn this way one could say that Reddit started as a deeply socialist project. Contribution was an end in itself. Content is available to everyone equally - we do not have to earn karma to access content, it is provided freely to us. The only incentive to provide content was that of providing to the social wellbeing of all  Reddit users. That is socialist, if not outright communist - abandoning all needs for an exchange system is part of the socialist utopian vision.\n\nWhat developed based on the Karma Fetishism on the other hand mirrors the problems that markets bring. It increases the supply, but much of that additional supply is actually quite bad - produced under questionable conditions, catering to needs that were artificially created. \n\nTo me it appears that Reddit works best in small subreddits, where karma whores are quickly outed and hated. Those are the places of good content and meaningful discussion, and karma plays no role - a communist paradise, one could say.",

        "text": "This was something that crossed my mind today, and I was surprised to see a very pertinent thread posted just yesterday (the one on whether you have 'improved' since joining reddit). Notwithstanding the existence of that thread, I felt like this question warranted a more focused discussion.\n\nThough I have a specific instance which I will soon elaborate, I am asking this in general to anybody in academia (or any field that involves critical writing); students and professionals alike. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nNow, how would one qualify the archetypal 'Good Redditor'? I think one of the biggest facets of popular reddit conduct is the expectation that you should 'question *everything*'. \n\nIt is not so much cynicism or contrarianism per se, but I'd expect any long-time reddit user to know the breed of skepticism I'm talking about: the top non-joke comment on threads is often a person 'disproving' or 'playing devil's advocate' against the gist of the submission itself. Additionally, the top non-parent reply in a thread is often a person 'disproving or 'playing devil's advocate' against *the original disprover*.\n\nAn example: OP submits a meme about 'Good guy Mark Wahlberg', praising Wahlberg for a perceived accomplishment. The top comment is a paragraph about how Mark Wahlberg is actually not a great guy, has done bad things in the past, and his 'accomplishment' itself was very misguided. The top *reply* is somebody defending Wahlberg, saying he has perhaps repented for this past deeds (though not necessarily agreeing with OP). You can imagine this continues in a rabbit hole of people different people offering alternative and contradictory views.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThat others have noticed this behavior (which I figured is self-evident regardless) was confirmed in the TOR thread; here are some replies I picked out:\n\n&gt;I question a lot of things people say more, not taking everything at face value but actually doing some research on the topic before deciding for myself.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt;Very simply put I now question any fact I hear or read. The constant fact checking done by so many redditors, and misleading title post for karma has made me more weary to accept statements made with out a source. It has been a positive because it has opened my eyes to looking for both sides of the story.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nMost would agree that skepticism is a valuable trait anywhere, but one user shared a problematic aspect to which I refer:\n\n&gt;I have to admit, I've caught myself several times hitting the reply button only to realized about 5s later that I had nothing to contribute except something possibly condescending or tangentially relevant.\nI think reddit has helped me foster my inner skeptic and rationalist but it hasn't always helped me foster my manners online or offline.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n***************************************\n\nNow I turn to my personal experience (I am wondering whether this is just me, or others have found it as well):\n\nI am studying English in college, and thus the entire course is based around critical analysis. First term finished today, and despite a commendation of scholarship, the one universal criticism against me is that I take a very opinionated voice on everything, always calling out the authors/works we read, in an overblown 'journalistic' manner. Whether it's painting Tennyson as a self-inserting nostalgic or denouncing Engels for sleazy pathos, you get the idea.\n\nI agree that this is a problem and I certainly notice it in my writing. I feel, moreover, that I gradually developed this habit due to several years of highly-active redditing. Maybe it was something I always did, but I suspect it derives from reddit's penchant for latching onto the flaws in every major philosophy, no matter how intelligent or well-regarded the expressor is. \n\nFrom Ron Paul to Michelle Bachman, from Richard Dawkins to Jenny McCarthy, you will **always** find somebody who delivers a sweeping discreditation of their work.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo, whether it is exaggerated skepticism or any other habit, have you found your real-life writing affected by reddit?",

        "text": "I'm interested in how reddit creates a sense of community, specifically how it maintains a sense of community despite its incredible size.\n\n\nWhen both I, and the internet, were younger, I was really drawn to online forums associated with different games, movies, or televisions hows. As my interest in the theme of those message boards decreased, I spent more and more time in the off-topic sections, which I think constituted some of the most vivid and interesting communities, not just online, that I have interacted with.\n\n Some observations/comparisons:\n\n1. Because of the multitude of redditors, you don't run into the same posters very often. This inhibits your bonding with other people, so that the most meaningful relationship becomes the one between you and the community, rather than between you and other *members* of the community. Thus, the community is necessarily the other, and **you never really integrate** into it since you are aware of it as a single, composite actor, rather than a group.\n\n2. Even if you do participate in small subreddits, because subreddits are organized around interests and mods believe that they need to keep their subreddit on topic, you only grow to know another poster in respect to your shared interest. On off-topic things, you both go to other niche subreddits. **Any relationships you do form on reddit are more likely to be one-dimensional**\n\n3. Because you share and discuss content on specialized reddits, the people who consume and engage with your content are typically specialists (I'm using this term loosely). It's hard to feel distinguished or particularly knowledgable among similarly specialized people.\n\n**An idea:**\n\nI think it could be an interesting experiment to create an insular, exclusive, off-topic subreddit to engender a different, and perhaps more rewarding, experience of community.\n\nThink of it like a high school home room--a smallish group of people, who you have nothing in particular in common with, that you talk about a full range of thoughts, events, and interests with. You venture outside of the group for your specialized pursuits, but bring that back to the community at the end of the day. You actually get to know very different people who you might not have interacted with otherwise.\n\nThoughts?\n\nIf people like this idea, I think we should discuss trying it out. If it ends up being a meaningful experience, then we could look into promoting it as a model for more subreddits.\n\nSome questions of logistics:\nWhat would be a good number of people that would both be large enough to create an active, diverse community, but not too large as to dilute members' ability to get to know each other?\n\nHow do you recruit people as to have diverse enough community?\n\nHow does that community govern itself? I think elected mods and policies would be fitting, and an interesting experiment in itself.\n\n\np.s. I imagine that communities that fill this role likely naturally spring up from time to time, but I do think there's something interesting in the utopian project of constructing a community.\n",

I feel that while some subreddits benefit from being very open and unrestricted, some would benefit from stronger moderation.\n\n  I guess I am wondering if a spell of very strong moderation might help \"right the ship\" a bit, it won't solve all the problems and trolls (and the like) will always be a issue but I can't help but feel that if it is done for long enough, it could potentially encourage more users to police both their own posts but also help the moderators do their jobs more effectively (and thus make said subreddits generally more pleasant).\n\n  ",

Therefore, upvote mentality for attractive female submissions is trivial.\n\n- Female submissions, 18 to 24, will be immediately upvoted across all 3 subreddits. This may be countermanded by low quality submissions of the female poster.\n\n- Male submissions, of all ages, will be downvoted in all 3 subreddits, HOWEVER, if in the title the male user submits pictures of \"progress over time X\", they will be upvoted significantly compared to male users who do not include 'progress pictures'. \n\n- Progress pictures will be significantly upvoted, regardless of gender.\n\n- Follow up posts with updates to the poster's appearance, usually prompted by comments to their previous appearance will be upvoted significantly more than the original post regardless of gender.\n\n- Posters that highlight disabilities that they've had to live with will be upvoted significantly, regardless of gender.\n\n- /r/AmIUgly has a higher tolerance for male submissions.\n\n- /r/AmISexy will upvote novelty male submissions, however this may have been discontinued by the subreddit's mods.\n\n\n**Supporting Evidence:** \n\n- The top scoring posts for this month (2014 November) in /r/rateme, /r/amisexy, and /r/amiugly are completely all Female posts except for 1 male post in AmIUgly.\n\n[RateMe](http://www.reddit.com/r/Rateme/top/?sort=top&amp;t=month)\n\n[AmISexy](http://www.reddit.com/r/AmISexy/top/)\n\n[AmIUgly](http://www.reddit.com/r/amiugly/top/)\n\n[Male post](http://www.reddit.com/r/amiugly/comments/2kj88k/took_the_advice_about_getting_a_haircut_what_do/) that reached the \"Top Monthly\" in AmIUgly.\n\n**Conclusions**\n\nWhile the userbase of each subreddit favors female submissions in the age range of 18-24, this aligns with Reddit's male dominated userbase. \n\nWhile each subreddit has their own rules, males genuinely wishing to receive honest criticism for their appearance may find it hard to do so. Which may prompt demand for a subreddit focused on male appearance, similar to the malefashionadvice, malehairadvice subreddits.",

It'll probably be upvoted if the comment is kinda relevant and will probably be well received. This is the origin, and the start of propagation. From there other redditors will see the joke, and it will be in the back of their minds for the next couple of days. Inevitably there will be another thread with another opportunity to make the joke. This is where it gets fun   \n\nNow the joke is said again, \"whoop whoop me?\" or something. Less upvotes, but still reasonable. The people who saw it yesterday aren't as inclined to upvote, but that won't stop the rest.

He wasn't trying to game the system, but he was making a different mistake that's not hard when we look at a site that keeps score: we're all trained to some degree to believe that scores *mean* something. \n\nSo there he is, elated last night, but texting me this morning about how bullshit it is that he got gilded and then like 150 comment karma rolled in for what he thought was a throwaway response, and how all of his effort before had meant nothing. Again, it's not like the site doesn't straight up tell you that the internet points don't count! It's a trap that he's fallen into, and I think that I did too.\n\nIn truth, I don't have suggestions, and was looking more for explanations. I wonder how many other people are out there playing reddit like it's a competitive sport. I wonder if there's anything that could be done to make the numbers relate more to some kind of reality, rather than feeling so fickle, without losing the ability to put really shit comments under the threshold. I assume there's not, but someone here might have something brilliant on offer.\n\nMost of all, I think we all know people who are competitive and self-critical. There's part of me that wishes that there was a special opening guide for them that emphasized that chasing points is totally stupid because you'll not get them for no reason and get them for no reason, and that the system can be effectively gamed, so stop thinking your score reflects you in any way.\n\nI don't play the game. I comment mostly, and have basically one post I got all my post karma for. I'm ok. But other than theoretically chilling out, what's the advice for him?",

        "text": "A little bit of background: As my username might suggest, I am a [Canadian historian]( https://uwaterloo.academia.edu/GeoffKeelan).  I have been active on Reddit for several years longer than the age of this account, I am a semi-regular contributor to /r/AskHistorians (depending on how busy I am), and for a year and a half, a content creator.  I’ve posted links to my [blog]( http://clioscurrent.com/) here on the site since its creation as well as discussing what [a site like Reddit means for historians]( http://clioscurrent.com/blog?tag=Reddit).\n\nAt first, I posted links fairly often before getting reported as a spammer, which cut down on my frequency quite a bit.  And, as you can see from my account page, I had a subreddit dedicated to my blog, before again realising this also contravened Reddit rules about posting your own content.\n\nI know this subreddit in particular has discussed the issue of [content]( http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/search?q=content+creators&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all) [creation]( http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/search?q=content+creation&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all) quite a bit, as well as one single post three years ago about Reddit as part of the [public sphere]( http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/kpjf6/is_reddit_a_discourse_community_a_public_sphere/), but I think the topic needs revisiting.  \n\nWhile one post by /u/alienth notes that [mods have the ability to decide whether a post is spam]( http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/22uah1/warning_youtube_personalities_and_other_content/cgqgcom) and that engagement is a key element of whether or not you are a spammer, most Subreddits mods I have interacted with have very strict rules about posting “blogs” or your own content.  They are either unaware of /u/alienth's clarification, or simply align their views with a more recent post by /u/yishan that [clearly outlines Reddit’s position]( http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/29x5a1/are_reddit_rules_made_to_coerce_newnot_well_known/cir1023) on content creation. In his words\n\n&gt;**reddit is not for content creators, it is for content consumers.**\n\nI think this reveals a contradiction with Reddit’s system, one I don’t know how to resolve, so I am putting forward to this audience in hopes that it might be clarified at least.  Since it is a site rule interpreted by moderators, I hope that it is a relevant topic for discussion here.\n\nThere’s very clear guidelines about [self-promotion]( http://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion) and how to avoid [spamming]( http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq#wiki_what_constitutes_spam.3F). Content creators are at the mercy of mods in a subreddit and whether or not they choose to abide by the site rules.  I think there are a lot of issues with the application of those rules on a case by case basis, but I think those issues have been debated at length already.  What I want to discuss here is two fold:\n\n* 1)“Content” as a product vs. content as discourse\n* 2) Reddit as a public sphere\n\nIn all of Reddit’s rules in regards to self-promotion, as well as in the comments offered by the most vitriolic defenders of them, it’s clear that admins are trying to avoid commercialization or commodifying “content.” That is, they want to avoid spam users submitting links to sell their own product directly, public relations, for the purpose of advertising revenue, or even just generating traffic to your own website.  In this sense, Reddit is a marketplace where users are vying for the best “stall.” But, as /u/yishan explained, this is not the purpose of the site but rather an outcome they are explicitly trying to avoid: \n\n&gt;**Finding high-quality interesting content that has been organically discovered and voted up is why users come to Reddit. The Reddit rules are intended to enforce that dynamic, because it is the one that creates the most value for users**\n\nOn the other hand, despite /u/yishan’s explanation that sponsored links “**are intended to \"coerce\" you into not promoting your own content**,” by offering that service, content becomes a commercialized. You can “buy” frontpage links, albeit through Reddit itself rather than some other PR service or spamming. The “stalls” in the marketplace are up for grabs.  \n\nThere’s nothing wrong with this approach, other than perhaps being a bit idealistic, I just think it firmly makes content into a product – which is to the detriment of the “spirit of Reddit” found in /u/yishan’s post.  I would argue that content is not *solely* a product, but rather must be considered as an interaction between creator and audience *in some cases*. That’s because, despite what its administrators want Reddit to be, it exists within the “digital public sphere.” \n\nWhat is the public sphere?\n\nThe concept of a public sphere was popularized by sociologist and philosopher [Jürgen Habermas]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%BCrgen_Habermas), though he was not the first to discuss the idea.  He points out in his book [The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Structural_Transformation_of_the_Public_Sphere) that the rise of the absolute state (such as France under Louis XIV) led to a separation between society and the state as the growing bourgeois society of the middle class sought to counteract the state's increasing social control and political centralization.  The public sphere formed as a space in which political discourse could occur between the state and its citizens.  Its development was a crucial part of the growth of modern society – it helped to emancipate people from arbitrary authority and unthinking customs by allowing them to debate political action. The public sphere shaped the modern, democratic society in which most Redditors live today. In theory, it allowed persons from diverse backgrounds with varying interests to set aside their differences to engage as individuals in discussion. \n\nIn simple terms, the public debated the issues of the day in the public sphere, eventually a majority could develop that would become “public opinion,” which in turn shaped government action through the will of the people.  Sound familiar?\n\nSo what is the digital public sphere?\n\nThe digital public sphere is far broader and immediate than anything previously imagined by sociologists or political theorists.  Online, individuals can express themselves freely and be exposed to the opinions of far more people than in the physical world.  Christian Fuchs explores the state of these “virtual communities” in his book, [Internet and Society: Social Theory in the Information Age]( http://www.amazon.com/Internet-Society-Information-Routledge-Technology/dp/0415889928), arguing that “cyberspace ... is coined by the forces of commercialization and commodification; on the other hand, it is also a space for a great deal of voluntary, altruistic cooperation as in the case of open-source and open-content communities, Wikipedia, online friendships, online love, and so on.”  The Internet is, so far, more easily accessible and participatory than physical society. Discourse between individuals is safer, as anonymity can protect you from repercussions, and broader, as anyone can participate.\n\nIt’s unavoidable that Reddit has become a platform where individuals can interact with each other in amazing and sometimes profound ways.  It cannot simply be reduced to content as products (though sometimes – if not often – it is), there must be an awareness that what happens here on this site is incredible.  It is interactive.  It is new way to be a part of the world.  As we’ve seen in so many blogs from the Admins, Reddit connects people to each other in surprising ways – it is part of the digital public sphere.\n\nSo I agree that Reddit is for the content consumer .  I think that is an integral facet of its nature as part of the digital public sphere – it is about the upvote democracy, Redditor interaction and debate, and above all, not chaining public discourse to a higher authority. Redditors make Reddit what it is, not the admins! Content creators are supposed to have a passive role in that process, not an active one.\n\nYet where does this leave the content creators who are there to interact within this public sphere of discourse, but not offer content-as-a-product?  Here is where I return to my role as a historian.\n\nHistorians have a duty to communicate history to the public.  If we exist in isolation, only discussing what we know and have discovered among ourselves, we are no longer participating in history, but in – to use Reddit’s terms – circle jerking.  Historian Carl Becker famously gave an address entitled “[Everyman his own Historian]( http://www.historians.org/about-aha-and-membership/aha-history-and-archives/presidential-addresses/carl-l-becker),” writing that \"If the essence of history is the memory of things said and done, then it is obvious that every normal person, Mr. Everyman, knows some history.”  Becker was explaining the similarities and differences between historians and his “Mr. Everyman” and emphasized that the historian's duty is to “not to repeat the past but to make use of it, to correct and rationalize for common use Mr. Everyman’s mythological adaptation of what actually happened.” \n\nBecker comes off as slightly condescending, but we can take the meaning of his message that historians must communicate history to non-historians. We must be actively involved in forming society's memory of historical events.  One of our most basic tasks, lecturing, is a way of communicating history to the public.  In the classroom and public lectures, historians are involved in providing meaning to the past. Some historians choose to write less academic history books. Others like myself, start blogs.\n\nSo – if Reddit is a part of the digital public sphere, and historians have a duty to engage in that space about history, and some of us create our own content based on our historical knowledge – how are we supposed to do that if we cannot “create content” here?\n\nI don’t post links to my blog to promote a “product” in any way.  There are no ads on my blog, nor books being sold, or what have you.  Instead, my purpose is to discuss history with a public audience and to reveal the historical background behind contemporary issues.  Sometimes we succeed, sometimes we fail – it’s a work in progress. I’m still trying to figure out how to be a historian in the digital age.\n\nBut, ultimately, we want to be a part of the digital public sphere because that is where history exists for many of those who have been “born digital.”  That is where the individual Redditor discusses the issues of the day, not the textbook or the newspaper or the classroom.  We try to post our links, to discuss the issues they raise, and as Becker notes, “to correct and rationalize for common use Mr. Everyman’s mythological adaptation of what actually happened.”  Are we to be limited only to answering questions in /r/AskHistorians?\n\nAs it stands, unless I go and delete my early forays into posting content, I should be banned for spamming according to the 9:1 ratio rule. So my options, if I want to post content, seems to be as follows:\n\n* post content solely for to meet the 9:1 ratio, essentially posting whatever I can to offset my own content.  This seems inherently disingenuous and contradictory to my role as a historian as well as the “spirit of Reddit.”\n\n* Make a fake account not publicly associated with my blog to post content that I “found.”  Also dishonest and contradicts my role as a historian.\n\n* Not post content hoping that a reader who “finds it” thinks it interesting and submits while I keeping engaged with Reddit via comments.  Not as fruitful, given that most Redditors are link clickers, not comment readers. \n\nI have essentially chosen the third option, with a few select postings when I think it’s extremely topically appropriate (usually to /r/CanadaPolitics, where the mods kindly accept me “spamming” according to the rules). \n\nMy questions then are these: \n\n* Are these self-promotion rules the only ones that will work and preserve the site’s intent as explained by /u/yishan?  \n* Must content creation only be considered as a form of self-promotion to preserve the intent as explained by /u/yishan?\n* Is there a way to make Reddit function as a space to communicate ideas and information via external sources, without falling victim to commodification/commercialization or dishonest practise? \n* If we accept that Reddit is a part of the public sphere – should this influence how moderators/admins to their jobs?\n",
