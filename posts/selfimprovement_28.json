        "text": "I’ll start off this post by saying I’ve been in a little bit of a rut lately or should I say for the past 4-5 years. After finishing high school, I went to a small community college. I finished after two years with an associates. I was dealing with an addiction to drugs at that time which ruined me, Finally got off it late 2020. I did it as I thought it would be helping with stress anxiety and big personal problems I was dealing with during that time but instead it was really doing the opposite. I’ve also been working and bouncing around between different jobs during 2018- 2022. Around 4 just trying different jobs out to see if they where for me or not. They weren’t but I did learn new knowledge and stepped out of my comfort zone. Now I’m at a job in a warehouse just to make some money for the time being. Im in the middle of a move to a new house as well  so being stuck in a small apartment doesn’t help but I don’t mind. Since getting Covid Twice I don’t feel the same as i used too. Will all that said and done I’m really optimistic about finally getting my life on track. I joined a gym 6 months ago and I’m seeing progress. I’m changing my diet. Which was 80% carbs like 20% fat. No veggies or fruit I now add veggies to all my meals. And fruits to my smoothies. My next step is working on my weakness watching videos on talking with a clear voice since I’ve always had speech problems growing up  I’m even watching videos on math since I wasn’t the best at it in school or how to learn faster on the fly. I also want to start hobbies I’ve been pushing off wanted to write a book or poetry. Do art or join a class specifically with clay I noticed as a child I used to do clay but I guess I lost that spark . Get better sleep as well. Make music lofi or learn an instrument. For a full time career I’m still stuck but if I do want to go back to college it’s for something I really want to pursue and not waste time and money. Am I on the right track?\n\nAlso does anyone know why typing out text is so laggy might just be my phone?",

        "text": "We met in summer 2019. We quickly “fell in love”- it was the first time in my (32m) life I had felt “head over heels” and she (34f) felt the same. She’s the most naturally beautiful woman I’ve ever seen, no exaggeration. We met each other’s families and things were getting serious—saying “I love you” and making plans for our shared future—right until she broke up with me out of the blue and without thorough explanation in April of 2020, about 8-9 months later. I was devastated and confused. I fought for the relationship for months but was rebuffed. \n\nIn July 2021 we run into each other after over a year of no contact. She was in a relationship and I was single at the time. We went for dinner despite her relationship status. At this rendezvous of ours, she tells me I’m “as handsome as ever”, and we continued seeing each other (semi) platonically for a couple of months. I know this wrong and I knew it then— she had a boyfriend and we shouldn’t have been seeing each other. She frequently complained about her boyfriend to me (he was critical of her, flakey, much older than us). I told her early on in our reconnecting that I still had strong feelings for her and didn’t want to hear about her boyfriend anymore; she told me that “was music to her ears, but that I might have to play the ‘long game’” because she wasn’t single. She interlaced her fingers with mine as she said this.\n\nWell, she broke up with her then boyfriend not long after in October 2021, and we began sleeping together a few weeks later. Right before we slept together the first time, she told me she “does love me, but is scared.” After sleeping together, she would pull away frequently (say things like “we shouldn’t have done that”) and she made a relationship impossible. I persisted. I got routinely hurt—really badly—by her cruel hot/cold treatment of me. As just one example of many, she had friends over one night and invited me. When I arrived she ignored me the whole time. Whenever I tried to contribute to the conversation, she would openly disagree with me in front of her friends (I didn’t know anyone there). \n\nAnother time, I also caught her in a lie—we had made plans one night. She texted me to cancel bc she wasn’t feeling well. Before I could respond, she texted me again, saying “can’t wait to see you tonight!” which was obviously meant for someone else. She apologized and said she had double booked herself, but really wasn’t feeling well. I then went “no contact” in Feb 2022. \n\nI missed her terribly, and reached out in April, just a couple months later. She was happy to hear from me, and by May we were now in a committed relationship (fully on the rollercoaster by this point), seemingly picking up where we had left off in our last relationship. She said she had realized over the preceding couple of months during NC how much she missed me and how important I was to her. \n\nBy June, we were saying “I love you,” going on weekend trips, and making plans to move in together. \n\nHappiest time of my life, until she abruptly ended things, yet again in sudden fashion after a weekend away with her parents in October. She was distant on the trip, and more critical of me than normal. She was frequently critical toward me in general, or undermining, or belittling. At times, I couldn’t do anything right; I made the bed wrong, she was critical of my cooking, and worst of all she told me I was “annoying” and “cringey” in a certain social situation on that trip. When we got back she told me she loved me less than she did before we left, and thought she wanted to date other people. \n\nI was devastated, again. Despite the breakup, we continued to see each other for dinner—usually at my apartment. I continued with my Herculean efforts—cooking elaborate meals for us, having her favorite wine ready, etc., but no sex and her demeanor towards me was frequently cold. One night when she came over, only a few weeks after the trip with her parents and subsequent breakup, I asked if she had started dating. She said yes, and that there had been a few. I stupidly asked if she had slept with any of them. She said she “didn’t want to talk about that with me,” to which I said “so that’s a yes.” I started getting emotional and politely asked her to leave. Less than a month earlier I was being paraded around her family like their future son-in-law, and now she was sleeping with other guys, just like that. \n\n\nIn the beginning of our relationship (both times), I experienced “love bombing” —she would say things like “I hope our kids have your face,” “I can’t wait to move in with you,””I love you,” “I’m crazy about you” and “you’re so important to me.” This love bombing quickly shifted to devaluation (frequent criticism over small things despite my endless efforts to please her, belittling, prioritizing others over me, withholding affection, etc). It went from 0 to 100 and back to 0 again, in a matter of months. I was an objectively good boyfriend. I loved her endlessly and passionately, and she was my main priority. \n\nI reached out to her over Christmas, only to be told she’s now in a “serious” relationship and doesn’t “feel right about seeing each other one-on-one.” The wound gets deeper and deeper. \n\nI recently ran into her the other day at CVS, turned down the isle and boom there she was. I walked up and said hi, she gave me a hug and I wished her well etc, and walked away. Seeing her was absolutely heartbreaking and I can’t stop thinking about her. I really just want to reach out to see how she’s doing— I care about her so deeply I can’t help it. Her birthday is coming up soon and I just know I’m going to reach out. I don’t think I’ll be able to resist. \n\nDespite all the times she’s hurt me, I still want her back, desperately. It’s been months and the anxiety is still killing me. I wake up most nights in a cold sweat after dreaming about her; they’re more like nightmares though. They’re dreams of her “with” her new bf, or humiliating me publicly, or some such thing. The thought of her falling in love with this new guy is destroying me. I picture him being better than me in ever way. \n\n\nI’m sorry for the long post, and if anyone has any ideas or insights as to her behavior, or what I should do, please share because I’m at a loss and can’t get over it. Thanks for reading.",

        "text": "You may have heard of spiritual bypassing. But what does it mean? \n\nThere's a movement in self development to always stay positive no matter what, to keep going no matter what, to keep using positive affirmations and keep pretending. But did you know that \"fake\" positivity is not helpful at all?\n\nIt doesn't help heal trauma. It doesn't help you feel better. It doesn't help you feel happier. On the contrary, when you're masking your true feelings, you're denying your truth, your true feelings. You're denying your true self, and therefore rejecting your true feelings and rejecting your true self.\n\nSo then why pretend to be well? What's the use in that? To be truly happy, you have to truly feel it and believe it within.\n\nSpiritual bypassing is an often overlooked concept in spiritual and personal development. It is a term used to describe the tendency of some people to use spiritual ideas and practices to avoiding dealing with unresolved emotional issues, psychological wounds, and unfinished developmental tasks.\n\nSpiritual bypassing is a term coined by psychologist John Welwood and it's when an individual uses spiritual practices and beliefs to bypass uncomfortable feelings and unresolved issues. It's a coping mechanism to deal with emotional pain and trauma. Spiritual bypassing is often used as a way to avoid dealing with difficult feelings, such as fear, sadness, guilt and shame.\n\nInstead, I encourage you to place awareness on your true feelings -- no matter what they may be -- and at least be honest with yourself about them. And instead of telling yourself something that's \"fake\" positive, tell yourself, \"I'm proud of myself for being honest my with myself. I'm proud that I have the courage to see even what I don't want to see. I am grateful that even though this is so uncomfortable for me, I am willing to deal with my challenges\". Now you're at least being honest with yourself.\n\n\"To Thine Own Self Be True\" - Shakespeare",

I want to study philosophy, art, science, maths, at my own pace, at my own rhythm, with the help of others. I absolutely CAN do this thanks to the internet, but the stress with school has been making me act out. \nTeachers want me to devote all my life to appear for exams and get a good degree, but I cannot relate to that at all. And so whenever I actually do that, I simply lose interest and get into my bad habits and addictions. the worst part is that, it was me who let it all happen. I allowed them to take control of me by being a \"good\" student in the class. By trying to gain my teacher's respect.

And I am fed up of these endless fights. I had an year and a half of a goo period, and now seven months into shit.  \nI don't see the point in anything. In getting a shower. Working out. Doing better for my job. I just drag myself out of bed one hour later and do the bare minimum. This is not sadness, this is hell - not having a point to live, to strive to be better.  \n\n\nMy only refuge is alcohol. I am a beer junkie. I feel the extistential burden not being there for a while, just for 20-30 mins when I down  a beer or two. And then some more. I had a window of not drinking for almost 2 months, because I had fucked up my liver - and I was still shit without it.  \n\n\nI am planning to see a new psychiatrist next week and see if they would come up with better meds. During this good period I mentioned I felt so complete (in a very silly chilidish way) that I got this good paying new job. At a certai point I broke down again, felt like shit again, drinking made me gain more weight, so I am even more into the gutter.  \n\n\nMy problem is I am afraid of death. In a absurd way the voice is telling me, well your mother is 58, when she gets close to 70 you will be dying from fear about her death, hence nothing is worth it. Same happened with my grandmother - for years I was afraid of her eventual death. She died two-three weeks ago. Felt a strange \"relief\" of death anxiety for two days and it moved on to my mother.  \n\n\nAlso I am 33, male, don't have kids and the fact that I can't handle the stress of being a father and the thought I will never have a fmaily on my own, or that it won't even bring me relief is also eating me inside along with the fear of my mother's mortality, so I just do nothing, go to sleep early at 10, no desire to do shit to achieve anything and just drink",

        "text": "Hi everyone!! Looking for your insight and advice.\nI (22F) broke up with a toxic ex in may of last year. During our 4 years long relationship, he was controlling, jealous and abusive, while towards the end of our relationship he was going out every weekend partying and i did not have any idea what he was doing. He really was a piece of s**t and i do not miss him or the relationship. But since he was controlling, gradually i spent more time with him and shut down many opportunities to hang out with my friends. Covid didn’t help and i mostly only hung out with my two best friends beside him and my social life took a little dip. It did not really bother me that much since i hung out with him a lot and since we broke up, i am more social and went on trips and some hangouts that i for sure know i would not have attended if we were still together.\nBut now i cannot help but feel somehow lonely because time spent with friends obviously does not measure up to such an unhealthy codependent relationship and i always feel like a loser when i am home on weekends with nothing to do. I feel like i should be partying with a big friend group, which i do not have and that makes me feel even worse when i open instagram and see people having fun. I get that my friends are also in relationships and i guess i made these types of friendships because that was more fitting for me at the time. But i do wish i could have friends that were more outgoing and spontanious and that we could just go out on the weekends but i just feel like i am incapable of forming these types of friendships and i do not know whether it is just me trying to fill a hole that the breakup created in me. Would i just be sad and feeling like i am not enough in a different way if i went out more? Basically, i have a feeling that no matter how many social interactions i have, i will always crave more.\n\nIf i am being honest i think the problem is my ego, because i consider myself friendly and outgoing, and i do look quite attractive as well and i was usually in the more ‘popular’ group of people and maybe i just cannot comprehend how i could feel so inadequate all of a sudden. This makes me feel and question my looks, my personality and if i am more boring and unwanted than i thought.\n\nI feel kinda lost and i really look forward to your thoughts.",

I'm 19 and I'm definitely doing better than before. I went from having no friends to being someone who can basically talk to anyone, I noticed that I am quite sociable. I do have my friends with me, I learned a lot of lessons because of errors that I make. But sometimes I wonder who I am.\n\nWhen I'm with my friends, I'm the loud one. I'll laugh at simple stuffs, I crack jokes, I'm also emotionally available. I help those who needs help on some subjects, since I experienced before how hard it was to self study. There doesn't seem to be any problem right? \n\nWell, I have this weird feeling in me that I feel like I don't know myself. Even though I have friends I don't have a best friend, I know it's silly but I get really sad when I think about how I'm everyone's friend but no one is my best friend it's like all of my friends have their own closer friend.\n\nAnd actually I believe the reason is because I'm not sure of myself, I have a huge abandonment issue that I don't know how to heal from. I'm really open on tips on how to heal myself, since my happiness starts with me. I wanna start all over again and relearn or unlearn stuff.\n\nHow did you guys find yourself? Or how can I get to know myself?\n\n I see people who just have this \"I know myself\" type of vibe, and because they know who they are, they shine the brightest. I wanna shine too ^⁠_⁠_⁠_⁠_⁠_⁠_⁠_⁠_⁠_⁠^",

        "text": "Now, I’m a 19 year old Irish dude.\n6ft,skinny  but nice broad shoulders so I generally have the frame of a big guy, pretty deep voice and despite my facial features being a clash between masculine and feminine and my body and facial dysmorphia torturing me for years, I generally fit the traditionally masculine bill. Tall, decently big frame, deep voice, jaw, etc. (Not flattering myself here fellas this is all what I’ve been told and I really wish I was as hot as these words describe me I still am pretty pale and riddled with acne and my nose is pretty big and etc) \n\nThis is all relevant to something I’ve been struggling with. Im just so unsure of how to carry myself as a bi guy.\n\nI’ve started seeing this dude recently, 21M, best friend I’ve ever had and a complete fucking dreamboat, dude could be mistaken for a girl. He’s possibly one of the prettiest people I’ve ever seen. He’s really helped me out of a dark place that nearly killed me several times and he doesn’t even know it. Anyway…. I sucked his dick.\n\nOne morning we woke up hungover and I don’t even remember how it happened but we ended up stripping down and getting dirty. I sucked him off better than I even knew I’d be able to on my first try and we continued exploring eachother all morning. After we were done, we just lay there and I was just silently staring at the ceiling while he went back to sleep and I remember thinking “does this make me gay now?” \n\nI’ve been bisexual for as long as I can remember. I’ve always loved both genders, their unique traits and sex appeals and the variety of types on both sides there are. But prior to this encounter I’ve only ever had sex with girls. And yknow what? It was pretty boring. Because I’m supposed to be the dominant masculine one all the time.\n\nNow, don’t get me wrong, this experience has not shifted my sexuality, rather confirmed it. I’m still into girls and now I’m also into dudes with the same physical experience. I sincerely love both and I’m very excited by the possibilities, but it’s forced me to confront something about my identity I wasn’t aware of.\n\nI fucking hate the idea of being a traditional masculine man, but I love the idea of being masculine in a certain sense. I want to embrace my pretty boy looks, play around with my style and enhance the feminine aspects of my personality, but I want to keep working out, I wanna get bigger, stronger. I want to be strong enough to protect the people I care about, I want to be fierce. I want to be a man in the most primal sense of the word.\n\nBut I also want to be pretty. I want to feel sexy and loved. I want to be craved, worked for and earned. \n\n\nI want boys and girls to see me for what I am, not one or the other.\n\nI just don’t know how these two aspects can ever come together. My depression stops me from making real progress, it keeps this version of myself unacheivable and fake and unrealistic. It’s also stopped me from being able to talk to people, girls especially. The confidence I desperately want is just out of reach. \n\nI don’t know if I can be myself without being a clashing, awkward mess. And that deeply saddens me.\n\nI don’t want sympathy or validation, just unbiased advice. Cheers.",

One of whom uses the internet extensively,** ***and another who uses it almost never.***\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe first man kept up with the latest news. He kept his finger on the pulse of current trends. He knew what was cool and what was not. And he knew the details of the lives of celebrities.\n\n*The second man had no idea what was in the news. He had no idea what the current trends were. And in the midst of his day to day routines, he forgot that he didn’t know.*\n\nThe first man, hearing online that women found dad-bods attractive, stayed out of the gym. Later, after hearing online that women preferred ripped bodies, he furiously started lifting weights.\n\n*The second man exercised in a way that made his body look good when he looked in the mirror, and made him feel good throughout the day.*\n\nThe first man read online that women only like the top 10% of men on dating apps. He read online that women only liked men who were over 6 ft tall and had a 6 figure income. Being or having none of these things, he carried a sense of helplessness and low self-esteem around women, further repelling them away from him.\n\n*The second man, upon seeing a woman he liked, simply approached her and started a conversation.*\n\nThe first man watched endless hours of pornographic content online. He had deep interests in a large number of exotic and strange fetishes. And he dreamed of one day recreating these extreme and obscure fetishes in reality with a gorgeous girl with a beautiful face, perfect breasts and a nice curvy ass. He pleasured himself late into the night watching porn, fantasising, imagining and wishing.\n\n*The second man explored sex multiple times a week with his partner.*\n\nThe first man heard about the vegan diet online. Then he heard about the paelo diet. He did research, read the latest scientific papers, read ebooks, listened to podcasts and took a long list of supplements. He spent years trying to understand the science of nutrition and achieve the perfect diet.\n\n*The second man tried eating different kinds of foods and paid close attention to his body and his mind. After three months of trying different selections of food, he found a diet that made his body and brain feel good that he could could stick to for the rest of his life.*\n\nThe first man would carefully craft comments online; critiquing the works of others and delighting in the likes his comments received from other users.\n\n*The second man spent his time creating content and art that he truly believed in.*\n\nThe first man was filled with knowledge. He talked fast and talked a lot, his mouth rattling off facts, news and gossip to those he met, as his hands gestured wildly to match his rapid speech. He knew something about everything; his knowledge spread wide and thin.\n\n*The second man spoke slowly, deliberately and with purpose. The second man, despite not having much to talk about over a glass of wine, carried a presence with him that was felt by everybody in the room. A presence that often intimidated the men he encountered, while intriguing the women.*\n\nThe first man felt his neck stick out and his shoulders round forward; his body adapting permanently to the posture he held while using his laptop and phone.\n\n*The second man stood straight up and his shoulders naturally fell backwards; his posture being something that never crossed his mind.*\n\nThe first man carried a constant nagging fear that he was missing something; that there was some piece of information he didn’t yet have that would finally fill in the missing puzzle piece of his life.\n\n*The second man carried an aura that his own life puzzle had been complete since long ago.*\n\nThe first man felt resentful as he came to the end of his youth; feeling as though his life had passed quickly — his achievements few and far between.\n\n*The second man proudly moved on from his youth, satisfied that his younger days were finally over and ready to move on to the next stage of his life.*",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/115x69f/on_feeling_lost_in_college_social_life_career/",
        "text": "Hello everyone! I don't use reddit too frequently, but I do lurk on this subreddit sometimes (as a form of quasi-procrastination, usually). I'm taking the time to write out all my thoughts on the current state of my life, and would be delighted if anyone could give me some pointers regarding certain struggles I am currently going through. I'm at a point where I'm very unsatisfied with the current state and trajectory of my life, and I'm looking for advice to set me straight. My experience is definitely not unique, so I'm hoping some of you all could give me some advice if you have gone through similar issues. I've split my major concerns into 5 categories for organization's sake, and have summarized them at the end of this post for people who don't want to peruse my lame narrative.\n\nFor summarized context: I am currently a 21 y/o Asian female in university. \n\n**1.** **School** \n\nLike most people who are chronically judged by their academic achievement (i.e. people with strict parents), I have a love-hate relationship with school. I did extremely well all throughout high school in terms of academic achievement because that is what I based my self worth on. Even more so because I really had nothing else to fall back on in terms of self-worth-- I am not particularly pretty nor athletic nor charismatic. As someone with a burning desire, I suppose, to feel respected and admired, I leaned heavily on my grades to give me the validation I wanted so badly. Obviously, putting all your eggs in one basket is the surest way to a fragile mentality. This mindset was what led me to become sort of an academic generalist-- I did not pursue any of my passions but divided my time to maximize my grades. It was this mindset that essentially robbed me of any joy I had for learning and raised my anxiety regarding grades. I took the hardest classes and aimed to get the highest grades in all of them (to prove that I was the biggest bird); if I somehow failed in this endeavor, I would mentally beat myself up about it, thinking thoughts like \"I'm so stupid/dumb, I should just drop out and flip burgers because that's all that I'm good for anyways,\" or \"As if it wasn't enough that I wasn't born pretty or rich, I just had to be born stupid, too,\" etc. I of course realize how trashy and counterintuitive it is to cycle through these thoughts in seeking academic success, but it's difficult not think so negatively when the whole of my self worth stood on my academic accomplishments; without them, I saw myself as worthless. I have been told that I am overly critical of myself and others, and I really do think this criticism comes from a sort of self-loathing. I am trying hard to overcome this mindset, which I will elaborate more on in section 4. \n\nAnyways, while I did manage to graduate at the top of my class (trust me when I say I'm not trying to brag, even typing it out makes me recoil, but I need it for context), that self-doubt continued to linger. I was always asked why \"x\" or \"y\" wasn't the top of the class instead, and I would just have to laugh it off as if it didn't hurt me to do so. I had few friends in school, as those who knew me would just say that all I did was study and that I was not that fun to hang around, which is definitely understandable considering how I acted. Fast forward to now, and this academic grind/fear of failure has still continued to haunt me to this day. I take hard classes just for the sake of taking them. I do not enjoy some of them. I used to cry every day I drove to school, because I hated going. I take 19 hours/semester just to feel that I'm even remotely worth something. Since coming to college, I have definitely been humbled. I know that I am somewhat smart, but I also know that there are probably a billion people smarter than me. I know it's unbecoming/cringe to compare intelligence between people, but I am envious of people who I perceive to be smarter than me. I get through every day by telling myself that I am the dumbest person in the room, and that to succeed in any career, I have to work so much harder than them. So this terrible mentality has brought me to where I am at today. I currently am a triple major (2 STEM, 1 humanities) with 1 minor. I get 4-5 hours of sleep every day, and I am unable to function without energy drinks (I have tried coffee/tea but I hate the taste). I am currently pre-med because after graduating from high school I didn't have anything I was passionate enough about to pursue. My parents chose the pre-med track for me, and I assented because I didn't have anything else I liked enough to go against their decision. I'm at a point now where it really is do-or-die, that is, whether I want to keep playing up this farce of being a conscientious/responsible/motivated student or come to a halt and really think about if I like where I am headed at the heavy detriment of putting my academics/career on hold. I have no passions, but I wish I did. I know I can work very hard, but I want to know what for. My toxic relationship with school/academics really hit a breaking point where I passed out in the bathroom due to sleep deprivation/caffeine overload. I have been a chronic procrastinator and feel that this is due to my fear of failure; procrastination, of course, has further fueled my sleep deprivation, feelings of self-loathing, and hatred towards academia. \n\n**2. Social Life**\n\nAh social life, the unwilling martyr of my grades. Because all I did was study and play video games, I never really did talk to people while growing up. It didn't help that I am an Asian in a predominantly white community. When growing up, the coolest cats were always those who were good at sports. As someone who occupies the complete opposite side of the spectrum and has looks as visually pleasing as a cardboard box, I was not a top contender for the most popular kid at school. Combine these facts with my major introversion, it was the perfect set-up for the social anxiety I now have today. For context, I did not live on campus in a dormitory for any part of my college career, due to both A. COVID, and B. money. As such, in my third year of university, I have a grand total of zero (0) friends. I do have people who I share notes/homework with, but I have no one I would hang out with outside of school. Every single time I have tried to join a club or attend an event, I always end up cancelling last minute because I get too anxious. For instance, one time while walking to a club meeting, my knees starting shaking, I became nauseous, and I got cold sweats. I had to cancel because there was no way I could attend in that state. I have tried going to other meetings, but I am always too awkward to make conversation with anyone. I know it's immature, but I've grown a tad misanthropic/bitter/arrogant in regards to other people due to my inability to connect with them. I rationalize it by thinking that I wouldn't have anything in common with them anyways, or that I wouldn't like hanging out with them anyways. To some extent, this is probably true, as I loathe party/greek life culture. I hate drinking and loud noises/harsh lights. This does not mean I hate people, as I do like to debate/discuss with people over topics I enjoy. This inability to connect with people has led me to just do everything in a group project myself, or otherwise micromanage every component of it. During conversations, I can typically only carry them through when the topic is school or any of the video games I play; otherwise, I'm stiff and my dialogue sounds forced. I know I must seem insufferable right about now, but trust me when I say that I do want to improve. I don't want to have a ton of friends, I only want to be able to build a support system with like-minded people while I'm at university. I don't want to keep blaming my social anxiety for preventing me from growing and connecting with people.\n\n**3. Health**\n\n5-6 hours of sleep each day due to school/work/commute; it really is hard to get around this because of my loaded schedule. Usually I drink 1 energy drink/day at minimum because I like how productive I am when my brain is awake. Otherwise, I am too fatigued to get anything done properly. In regards to sleep schedule, I wake up at 5:30 AM and sleep at 11:30 PM. Sometimes I have to work overnight, which in that case, I go directly from work to school. I do consider myself to be have an evening chronotype, wherein I am more mentally/physically able during later hours of the day, but as I have classes in the morning, it's hard to get around this. I have passed out 2x from sleep deprivation. I have no chronic diseases, however. I ate like 3 broccoli over the past week, which is more vegetables I consume than normal. I wouldn't say I eat too much; rather, I only eat 2 meals a day, but this typically consists of fast food or meat/rice. I do want to try packing my own healthy lunch, but I feel as if this is a level of productivity I have yet to unlock, haha. I have gained about 10 lbs. since starting college. I do not exercise, and I live a sedentary lifestyle. I suspect that some of my mental anxiety/turmoil could be somewhat assuaged if I started to exercise and get the chemicals in the brain up and running. There is a gym at my school, but I have been too anxious to go. I have tried working out at home, but I get so bored, so this has never lasted long. In sum: diet bad, sleep bad, activity level bad.\n\n**4. Mental/Self-Perception**\n\nIf you've read this far, you probably understand that it's pretty bad. You probably saw the spikes of neuroticism, self-loathing, narcissism as a coping mechanism, social anxiety, and overall depressive symptoms. I have not been medically diagnosed with any of these, by the way, as I am afraid it would do more harm than good as of now. My parents are the type of people who think: \"if depressed, just be happy.\" I have tried communicating with them about my depression and anxiety, and I have been met with responses like \"grow up already,\" or \"it's time to start acting like an adult,\" or \"just fight it,\" or some religious comment like \"don't worry God has a plan for you.\" As a side note, I did grow up as a Christian, and while I do believe there is a God and bear no ill-will towards the church, just hearing my parents use God in a way to minimize my struggles is just so infuriating and grating to my mentality. Because of this, I have major apprehensions about seeking therapy or medication. It's not to say, however, that I am extremely anxious or depressed. I have thought about killing myself a couple of times in ways that are grandiose or shocking (what can I say, it's the performer in me), but I have never self-harmed or taken steps towards those plans, and I never plan on it. In regards to my physical appearance, there have been episodes where I have overall hated how I looked and have desperately wished to look like other girls. Unreliable narrator as I may be, I think I am extremely average/plain/homely in looks. No curves or accentuating feature. I have a face you would forget because it looks like the average of all Asian women combined. With the rise in popularity of Asian culture, my self-perception has become even worse as I have thousands of women prettier than me to compare myself to. And yes, I realize I could just cut back on social media usage, and I definitely plan on it. I have tried to \"glow-up\" in regards to my looks, but every single time I put on make-up or straighten my hair, I look in the mirror and think to myself: \"Ah, a little girl playing with makeup.\" So I typically just stick to neutral-colored, plain clothes that are comfortable for long periods of work. I at the very least try not to look slovenly, and I maintain my personal hygiene at the bare minimum. In regards to relationships, I have never had a boyfriend and felt that anyone would be unlucky to have me as their significant other. It's kind of sick, but whenever I do feel happy, I immediately become nauseous. I don't know how to explain that. I just want to have a stronger, more resilient mentality that doesn't break when things go off track. I want to be more amenable, charitable, and social without sacrificing the authenticity of my personality.\n\n**5. Career**\n\nAs stated before, I am currently on the pre-med track and have a job in a hospital. I also work in a lab. I do like both of my jobs, and they are generally not too time-demanding (although it really depends on the week). My major concern, though, is while I don't hate medicine as a career choice, I just feel that it is not right for me. I was initially drawn to the field for money and I am terrible at connecting with people. I intuitively know that someone like me should not be in healthcare. At this point, I really have to double down on medicine or explore other options. I know I can succeed as a doctor, but I am not sure whether this is the best course of action for me. The other option is for me to hold off on medicine and explore other options, of course, losing time and money in the process. I know the world is not an ideal place and 90% of people aren't working in careers they are passionate about, but I'm wondering if I could find a passion and work twice as hard if I put medicine on hold. So there's the conundrum: a pretty stable path with a set future (which albeit, does require a ton of effort) that I neither hate nor love, or a path that leads somewhere else-- a path that I could love but could otherwise cost me a lot of time and money only to lead me back to medicine.\n\n**Inquiries:**\n\n\\-How should I work to balance my school life?\n\n\\-Should I give up some time to pursue other interests (I say as if I have interests) or career options?\n\n\\-How should I connect with other people during my time in university?\n\n\\-How should I stop self-sabotaging?\n\n\\-Career advice in general (would be cool if it came from other people who are in the medical field).\n\n\\-What are some tips to get a more resilient mental?\n\n\\-What are some books/resources that you have used to improve yourself?\n\n\\-What are some tips to overcome anxiety when meeting new people?\n\n\\-How do you get yourself out of low points?\n\n\\-What are some healthy habits that you want to share?\n\n\\-or anything else you can think of\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThanks for reading this, although I'm sure many people won't, haha. I understand if I come off as very neurotic or insufferable, but trust me when I say that I am trying to improve myself to get a healthier mentality and lifestyle. I had a lot to get off my chest, and even typing this out helped me some. I would appreciate any tips of stories you would like to share. Thanks again! :)",

I feel like I've tried everything up until this point and everything else is just a quick way to pull me back into the cycle that i've been repeating for so many months now, I find a solution, I practice it, it leads to me overthinking the situation and I get back in once again.  \nI feel like i'm pushing away the very few people that are still in my life, most of the time it's hard for me to relax even around some of my closest friends, i don't know what to say to them, or what to talk about.  \nWhen it comes to my relationships with people I really just try so hard to make them work and yet, it all goes to waste very quickly.  \nI don't do a lot with my life at the moment as it's my summer break but it's like every day i don't do anything productive, and the days i do push myself to do stuff I get demotivated again anywhere between a day and a week, and it takes tremendous effort to push myself to do stuff again, and even the days i do push myself to do stuff (like working out) i feel extremely lazy before and afterwards, of course, this doesn't happen ALL the time, but it does happen a lot.  \n\n\nI just feel like i've tried everything i can to cope with this and it keeps coming back to me, i'm reaching the point where i'm genuinely desperate and scared for what lies ahead of me.   \n\n\nI don't know what to do anymore, i could try pushing myself to do stuff again, to start looking into my options for the future once again, but that dread i feel whenever i think about my social issues just destroys any kind of motivation i get.",

I have so much going for me but still feel like I'm mentally a zombie all the time. I feel depressed when I'm alone and highly anxious in public / around others. \n\nPhysically: Always have a feeling of malaise, like somethings not right, just tired, lethargic and just an \"unwell\" feeling. I wake up every morning feeling heavy and tired, no matter how much I slept. Feel achy and shitty and I'm ONLY 21. How the fuck do people go out there and do shit when I barely have enough energy to lay in bed.\n\nSpiritually: Feel no connection to God or anything. I don't necessarily believe in God but just feel completely empty, totally detached from spirituality and nature and other people. I feel very lonely and haven't had a girlfriend in 6 years. On top of this I feel like the future is bleak every time I watch the news and see the horrible path that the country / world is on. Life feels very meaningless and I feel quite lonely. \n\nI have felt like this off and on for about two years. I've tried changing my diet, getting more exercise, all kinds of shit, but just feel like there's something wrong with me. I'm in very good shape and have goals, but I am just so depressed and unhappy with my life and I don't even know why. I've tried self improvement books, tried adopting a david goggins mindset of mental toughness. But damn, I'm just exhausted. I'm just lying to myself, maybe one day I can accomplish the goals, but the next I'm right back in the hole again. \n\n How the hell can I change this. I've spent all day today laying in bed and staring at the ceiling, watching the hours fly by. Occasionally I get up, stare at my lifeless eyes in the mirror of my bathroom, wash my face and try to snap out of it, then go back to bed. I fucking hate living like this. I have things I was suppose to do, and I failed to do them. My apartment is all gloomy and dark, and I hate being cooped up all day, but simultaneously don't have the energy to get out of my apartment. \n\nPlease give me some advice. Thank you very much.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/115tmv8/lets_talk_about_consuming_with_intention_how_can/",
        "text": "In today's world, we are surrounded by an endless stream of information, thanks to the internet and social media. While this can be great for staying informed and entertained, it can also be a major distraction when it comes to achieving our personal goals.  I know I'm not the only one that finds myself \"doom-scrolling\" on TikTok or Reddit when I'm feeling overwhelmed. And I know I'm not the only one that feels so much guilt when I notice that 2-3 hours have passed and I haven't done anything remotely productive...\n\nThis is why it's essential to **consume with intention** – *to be mindful of the media we are intaking and choose content that supports our goals.*\n\nWhether you're working towards earning a degree, reaching a career goal, achieving a health/fitness milestone, or pursuing any other personal goal, consuming content that aligns with your objectives can be immensely helpful. Here are some of the benefits of consuming with intention:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**It helps you stay focused**\n\nWhen you consume content that aligns with your goals, it helps you stay focused and motivated. You're more likely to stay on track and avoid distractions that can derail your progress. By consuming content that reinforces your goals, you'll be more likely to make progress towards achieving them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**It provides valuable information**\n\nConsuming content related to your goals can also provide valuable information and insights that can help you make informed decisions. For example, if you're pursuing a fitness goal, you might find blogs or videos that provide workout tips or meal plans that are specifically designed to help you reach your goal. Alternatively, if you're working towards your degree or towards a career goal, you may find content that provides insight on a specific niche in the line of work that you're entering, or perhaps even finding tops on networking and enhancing your resume. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**It creates a supportive environment**\n\nWhen you consume content that aligns with your goals, you're surrounding yourself with a supportive environment. You'll be exposed to like-minded people who share your goals and can offer advice, encouragement, and support. This can be particularly helpful when you're facing challenges or setbacks, as it can help you stay motivated and positive.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**It saves time**\n\nWhen you consume with intention, you're less likely to waste time on content that doesn't support your goals. Rather than mindlessly scrolling through social media or watching random videos (which you're likely to forget about by tomorrow), you'll be spending your time on content that can actually help you achieve your objectives. This can be a huge time-saver in the long run, allowing you to make progress towards your goals more efficiently. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**So, how can you start consuming with intention? Here are some tips:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Identify your goals**\n\nThe first step is to identify your personal goals. What are you trying to achieve? Whether it's earning a degree, losing weight, or learning a new skill, make sure you have a clear understanding of what you want to accomplish.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Find relevant content**\n\nOnce you've identified your goals, start seeking out content that aligns with them. Look for blogs, videos, podcasts, or social media accounts that focus on topics related to your goals. You might also consider joining online communities or forums where you can connect with like-minded people who share your objectives.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Limit your intake of unrelated content**\n\nWhile it's okay to consume content that isn't directly related to your goals, make sure you're not spending *too much* time on it. Limit your intake of unrelated content, such as mindless scrolling on social media or binge-watching TV shows. Instead, prioritize consuming content that supports your goals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Evaluate your progress**\n\nFinally, make sure to regularly evaluate your progress towards your goals. Are you making progress? Are you staying motivated and focused? If not, you may need to adjust your content intake or your approach to achieving your goals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn summary, consuming content with intention can be an effective strategy to reach your goals. By intentionally choosing content that aligns with your objectives, you can stay on track, gain valuable knowledge, create a supportive environment, and save time. Therefore, being mindful of the media you intake is crucial for achieving personal growth and success.",

I have trouble focusing on what's going on and always disconnect from the group/conversations and have no idea how to get involved and enjoy myself.

I'm pretty sure I also have ADHD, since my focus is a weak point for my entire life. I just feel trapped on my inside and don't know how to let go and be myself, enjoy everything, just like another normal human being. I am interested in being social, making new friends (I have my group of friends, go out, and attend gym regularly, where I workout, but also have no trouble in having occasional small talk), but when it comes down to hanging out for long periods of time, I have lots of trouble engaging and keeping at it. New smile would probably do wonders, but it wouldn't fix all my ''problems'', so for those who overcame this, how did you manage to do it and how was your journey? Thanks in advance!",

What started as long covid (probably still going on), also resulted in depersonalization/derealization (dpdr); depression; anxiety, etc. . \n\nIn these \\~2 years, I have run away from my responsibilities and have found it extremely difficult to focus on myself. In this period, there has been a girl in my life which I became very fond of and she became my distraction of all my mental issues. In my head, she became the solution to everything: if she would choose for me, my life would be okay again. Even though my issues wouldn't have been solved, I wouldn't care because I was with Her: my ultimate goal in life.\n\nI've expressed my feelings towards her a while ago, and she didn't see me that way (how could she, I can't even love myself). At that time, I hoped that this rejection would wake me up from this state of mind. Unfortunately, about 2 months later, I still can't stop fantasizing about us being together and being with her still is my only goal in life.\n\nThe hard reality is that every other aspect in life is crumbling away. Due to massive brain fog I can't study, I can't work. I can't exercise since that massively exacerbates my symptoms. I'm living with my parents again and can't take care of myself.\n\nThing is that even now, all I can think of is being with her and being with her would 'solve all the issues', at least that's what is feels like. \n\nI also notice that when I decide to change myself for the better, or at least think about it (it's damn hard to pursue anything in this massive dpdr brain fog), I feel that I do it to increase my chances with her. Every choice I make is with her in my mind.\n\nRationally, there are many reasons why I think that we wouldn't work out anyway and I can find things which I truly dislike about her. Even then, these personality traits of hers are ignored by me 'because she is perfect'.\n\nI've been struggling with this for a while now. I'm seeing a psychologist and also discuss this with her, but I don't see her that often unfortunately.\n\nDoes any of you have an idea/tip how to deal with this, where this is coming from and how to get rid of it?\n\nThanks a million for your help.",

        "text": " I want to eventually be able to go up to a girl I find attractive and start a conversation from nothing. Initially I made it a goal to go up to every girl I saw and start a conversation but that was stupidly ambitious. So instead, I've made some prompts to get to a stage where I can get to that level and not feel self concious. Today’s prompt was **“Ask someone how are you and** **ask a follow up question”**\n\n**Before:**\n\nKind of similar to yesterdays answer how are you with fantastic. Instead of moving on straight away, sit in the tension and see what comes out of it. I might ask something a bit different to get a better answer tho. Something along the lines of ‘how’s your day going’ just to spice it up\n\n**Experience:**\n\nStarted with the guy at the store asking me how my day was, I said ‘good… actually fantastic’ (I’m learning slowly but surely). I then followed up with how are you doing, just starting or close to finishing and then if he had anything nice planned for after. He told me he was going for steak with the fam so we got talking about steak. I said I look forward to hearing about it when I see him next.\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\nOne thing that’s interesting from this experience is that with every new stranger I say hello to, am upbeat with and learn more about, there’s one less stranger in the world, one less person to be anxious around as I know them to some extent.\n\n**If you have any thoughts/ideas for prompts which I could use to slowgress towards confidence with strangers then lmk.**",

        "text": "I guess I’ll just ramble here. I have Asperger’s and have posted here several times looking for advice to the crisis that is my social life. Never to any avail though. People have given me advice and tried to help but it just feels like I’m a lost cause.\n\nI have exactly one friend who I talk to on a regular basis and who I hang out with, although being at college now I don’t hang out with him. I have other “friends” I talk to, mostly in classes, and other people I used to be close friends with who I text every now and then.\n\nSo, at the end of the day, my only in-person real socialization is with people in my classes. I’m not bad at talking with other people, at least not when we have a full on conversation and I’m somewhat comfortable with them. For example, in my lab group in class there’s a girl and two guys and I make them laugh, smile, and I love talking with them and listening to them. But that only lasts for an hour and a half twice a week, and that’s the most socialization I do in a week. I enjoy it, and I look forward to it, but I can’t figure out how to do that outside of class. It’s like a world of difference.\n\nSome days I become so lonely and crave socialization so much that I’ll go to the grocery store, I’ll go to the gym (sometimes even twice a day), and heck even taking a shower sometimes makes me feel better in this regard. But afterwards it really doesn’t make much of a difference. Even going to the dining hall, where I always sit by myself. But it’s all only temporary relief.\n\nI’ve decided to start improving myself, too, which makes me feel better about myself and makes me happier. For example, I’ve started working out, taking care of my acne, doing more for my oral hygiene, et cetera. And it has put me in a better place mentally and physically, certainly. But it still doesn’t solve my social life, or lack there of.\n\nI’ve posted in the Asperger’s subreddit to see how others deal with this, but that only ever disappoints and saddens me. They all seem to believe that there is no solution and with Asperger’s we’re cursed for a life of isolation and loneliness. I don’t want to believe that. I want to believe that I can find at least one person at the very least to share my life with.\n\nAnd I know it’s possible, and that’s partially why I’ve started working to improve myself. I want to become a person who can be happy alone so that I can bring happiness to other people and make and strengthen relationships. I’m not a bad person, I’m not an ugly person, and I’m not an unhealthy person, but I have to admit that I am lonely no matter how hard I try to be able to be happy alone.\n\nBut I don’t know how. I don’t know what to do. I don’t know how to improve this facet of my life. I can improve everything else but no matter what advice I’m given, I can’t seem to improve it. And while I can find motivation and discipline in myself to improve myself and be happy with myself, I want more than that, I want to share, love, and grow with other people but that is the impassible obstacle I’ve struggled with and likely always will.",

Later a while when we came out jenifer was totally into me and kissing me and we were making out in cab . Later we reached her place where I went down her and made her come orgasm and vice versa. But I was somewhere not in the mood for sex and wanted to know someone more. So we didn’t have sex.\n\nComing forward to 3rd date yesterday,we went out and while we came back to her place and were kissing , she stops in the middle and says “I am not feeling anything” and she also said “that day whatever happened im the drunk state doesnt count as she wasnt sober”…. Later to this line we were cuddling again and talking about her insecurities. But her line seemed like an red flag to me. \nI mean genuine desire is irreplaceable. Whats should I do ?
