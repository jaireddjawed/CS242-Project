        "text": "Hello all,\n\nThis question pertains to Lyophilization and/or freeze drying technology for avian semen. I am about to purchase a freeze dryer from Harvest Right, mainly to use for food for myself and making my own pellets for my critically endangered species of parrots. I intend to breed them when they are old enough. In the case where they do not breed well on their own, I intend to pursue assisted reproduction methods. This may possibly involve lyophilizing or freeze-drying artificially extracted semen through the cloacal massage technique, or electroejaculation if that is something I must pursue.\n\nAnyway, I was wondering if it is worth purchasing the more costly scientific freeze dryer unit, so that I may use it for possible future use of Lyophilization or freeze-drying avian semen. Otherwise I would get the less costly 'home freeze-dryer' which has less sophisticated software for control and just be used for food. What are the findings of this semen preservation method for conservation? I think I read somwhere that this method tends to cause semen to become 'immotile' after reconstitution, and would thus only work with 'intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI)', which sounds like it would be out of my capability.",

Lot of research to find NGO, lot of research to find potential job and paid volunteering everywhere.\n\nFunding is also a big problem for organizations.\n\nThatâ€™s why I was just thinking and brainstorming and idea of a conservation hub regrouping all opportunities of career or volunteering. Also a place where organization could get funding more easily via a crowdfunding scheme.\n\nI did a small research, but I donâ€™t know if it already exist. I also know there are multiple websites to find job or different ways to find volunteering opportunitiesâ€¦ But what about just one single place to visit? Or maybe we forget about the job/volunteer part and we focus only to make funding more accessible?\n\nI did a small form to gather feedback. So plz visit and share your thoughts.\nhttps://forms.office.com/r/v7taiqddQj\n\n\nPs: Iâ€™m not a web developer. Itâ€™s just a random idea I had the other day which si think was making sense.
