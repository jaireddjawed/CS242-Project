The crux of my argument isn't really important here, but my usage of \"analepsis\" in noun and adjective form is.\n\nOne of my professors, after a reading of a previous version, suggested the term. It reads as kind of clunky in my essay upon a rereading I did today.\n\n*OED* has it listed in the way I'm using it, but I'm not sure if this is something that people are using in the narratological discourse to describe the way that the narrative in the novel works.\n\nI guess my question is this: what does analepsis mean to you, and is it used much? \n\nPS: There's a chance that I'm over-thinking the use of this term. Forgive me if you find this question unnecessary or poorly stated.",

        "text": "This question isn't like most on here, but the topic list on the right states \"including but not limited to\" and I think you guys will have the most expertise on Reddit on this subject.\n\nI graduated with an English degree a decade ago, with an emphasis in Critical Theory. Although I used to consider myself a great writer stylistically (at its best my non-fiction style is dense and wordy with lots of run-on sentences, without sacrificing coherence), lately I have felt stuck in a rut. I write a lot for work, but I work in a field totally unrelated to my degree and my writing is almost entirely for work on various business subjects. I am the only English major I work with, so there is no reason to put too much effort into my writing. In short, I have gotten lazy.\n\nThe vast majority of my sentences follow the same style. I start off with a positive comment, but then I tell you the downside. It's a compact and always-relevant sentence structure, but way too easy to overuse. The only variety I have is the similarly structure cause-and-effect sentence, so sometimes I mix it up like this. They're both nice sentence structures and maybe I'm just too self conscious, but every sentence I write makes me wince in awkwardness.\n\nSo please, ALS, tell me how to be a better writer. I feel old and stuck in my ways, but I want to get back to the pride I used to take in my writing. I don't have the time or energy to take up writing as a hobby (yes, I guess you could say I sold out long ago), so I want to combine form with function (in the least literary sense of that phrase possible).",

Being the-one-for-the-other is being there, both \"meaning\" itself and waiting, listening for meaning. It does not remove the condition of otherness, but it does mean that the particular condition of the other's otherness—being one—might be more audible, or visible. If so, then this itself would be less othering, as I think it is for Eve at the very end of Paradise Lost.\n\nThe \"this\" in the final sentence could conceivably refer to several things mentioned in the last few sentences, and to either a whole sentence, or just part of one. The word \"this\" is useful to eliminate having to repeat a phrase several times, but the more complex the context gets, the less obvious it is what the referent is. Does identifying the referent get easier with practice? Is it bad style to use \"this\" when the surrounding syntax is as complex as it seems to me in this case? Do authors ever do this to be intentionally ambiguous?",

Looking at the stones that once marked graves, he sees his name, the date of his birth, and the date of his death. He then realizes that he is dead, and is amidst the ruins of the \"ancient and famous city of Carcosa.\" \n\n**A footnote at the end of the story states, \"Such are the facts imparted to the medium Bayrolles by the spirit Hoseib Alar Robardin.\"**\n\nThis is supposedly a famous line, but I don't really understand the significance. \n",

I recognise that Jane Austin was a good author but that does not make reading Pride and Prejudice any less painful.\n\nI feel like this is seriously affecting my grades. Last year we did WW1 literature and I really enjoyed it, the poems seemed to be full of meaning, and spoke to me on an emotional level. I found it easy to form opinions on pieces of literature and more importantly to write about those opinions. The romantic literature feels like the complete opposite, most of the time when I sit down to write an essay I get stuck behind writers block until ~3 hours before the deadline then produce a really bad essay. (because a bad essay is better than no essay)\n\nI don't know how to start finish or end an essay which is normally titled similar to 'compare and contrast the portrayal of love in the literature you have studied?' At some point a question gets so open ended it stops being a question and I feel that questions like this are right on that limit. \n\nIs there a good way of finding an appreciation for this genre? Or at least gain enough of an appreciation to get me through my A level.",

The abstract is as follows:\n\n\n       As a uniquely Indigenous movement, Two-Spirit as identity and  \n       cultural enactment pertains directly to the realities of living as    \n       an Indigenous person whose sexuality and cultural identity are    \n       implicitly “other”. Two-Spiritedness, in both concept and  \n       practice, therefore exists in contradistinction to white queer   \n       normativity, undermining the prescriptive paradigms of both \n       'queerness' and 'whiteness'. In this way, Two-Spirit \t\t\n       identity resists queer conventions of settler nationalism, refusing \n       and refuting the deliberate erasure of cultural identification \n       localized within sexual and gender identities. For Metis poet \n       Gregory Scofield, the navigation of cultural identity within \n       the parameters of cultural hybridity and queer identity involves \n       explicit engagement with the pluralities of queer, indigenous, and \n       Two-Spirit identities. In Native Canadiana: Songs from the  \n       Urban Rez, Scofield calls attention to the inherent  \n       contradictions and complexities of these identities through three \n       dominant lenses: that of the erotic, the ironic, and the sacred.  \n       The erotic poems of Native Canadiana explore the \n       complications of queer power dynamics between colonizer and \n       colonized, using humour, imagery from Metis cultural practice, \n       and historical-colonial context to engage with the consequences \n       of specifically queer and Indigenous realities. The interweaving  \n       of pluralistic identities constitutes a necessarily postcolonial and  \n       emphatically decolonial self-identification. To explore the \n       racialized dimensions of queerness through Two-Spirit and \n       Indigenous queer identity in Scofield's poetry is to engage and \n       enact these identities and tie them to the realm of cultural \n       production.\n\nThank you!\n\nETA: Not sure why the font turned out that way, but it's in Times New Roman on my document. Also, the title of his work is appropriately italicized in my draft.",

I'm quite happy studying English and have gained a lot from the classes I've previously taken. This year I enrolled in an all year study of American and British Modernism.

I have one semester left in this course and it is important to me that I excel with a reputable grade, but that I also take away an education.

        "text": "I'm a grad student teaching a composition course next semester. I'm organizing the class around environmental consciousness. I'm planning to do a survey of environmental consciousness through literature and I have a few questions I hope you all can help me with.\n\nFirst, the constraints: (a) I'm a grad student and eco-criticism is *not* my specialty. That said, I'm reasonably well read in the sub-discipline (compared to the non-specialists I've talked to so far at any rate) and I've got time over break to crash-course myself. (b) The course is gen. ed. so I need it to be accessible to students from all majors. (c) The course is research based, culminating in a 10-15 page research paper, and since it is gen. ed. I want the students to be able to do research in their own disciplines.\n\nSecond, the non-constraints: (a) I don't want to instigate a debate about the \"ability\" for composition students to discuss literature at a high-level. Let me deal with that.\n\nThat out of the way, my questions:\n\n(1) I want to do a historical trajectory. The idea here is to give students an understanding of how Western societies have understood their relationship to nature over time. (From there, they can do research in any number of areas, with an attention to the ways in which environmental representation affects the ideological frameworks motivating the debates around whatever research topic they choose.) Accordingly, I'm planning to start with the Classics and move to the modern day. I teach at an American university, so I do plan to stick to primarily American authors once I reach the Industrial Revolution. That said, here's my list so far. You will see that it has tremendous gaps.\n\n---\n\n**Archaic Greece:**\n\nHesiod (beginnings of the pastoral genre)\n\n**Classical Greece:**\n\nTheocritus (pastoral)\n\n**Hellenistic Greece:**\n\n?\n\n**Rome:**\n\n?\n\nBasically I am thinking Apollo and Daphne from Ovid and then the Eclogues and Georgics from Virgil. I will present the Georgics as a new sub-genre of the pastoral.\n\n---\n\n**Judeo-Christian**\n\nGenesis 1-3\n\nPotentially the Israelites wandering in the desert, but probably not.\n\nMatthew 25, parable of the talents\n\nI'd appreciate other ideas.\n\n---\n\nAs you can probably see from this section of the list, I'm working with ideas of Eden, Arcadia, the role of labor both pre- and post-lapsarian, etc.\n\n---\n\n**Middle Ages**\n\nNo idea??? This is so far outside my training.\n\nAt this point I'm starting to move towards specifically American nature literature as much as possible.\n\n---\n\n**American Agrarian**\n\nJefferson\n\n**Industrial Revolution**\n\n--Romantics: I really only know the English Romantics so American suggestions would be helpful.\n\n--Transcendentalists: Emerson, Thoreau\n\n--Naturalists: Specific works from the usual suspects would be much appreciated here.\n\n\n**Cold War**\n\nAny post-WWII suggestions? Preferably literature, although I have *Silent Spring* in mind for non-fiction. Obviously the focus here will be on the onset of the apocalyptic mindset.\n\n**Post-Fordist Capitalism**\n\nI'm looking for suggestions about waste and consumer capitalism here. I'm thinking DeLilo, but I'd appreciate other suggestions as well. Also apocalyptic literature specifically concerned with the environment.\n\n---\n\nAs you can see, this list needs much filling in, and lacks certain important movements, such as American agrarian protest literature (*e.g.* Wendell Berry). Pointing out any egregious omissions would be much appreciated.\n\n(2) I need critical theory reading assignments to buttress my own ability to teach this effectively. I'm sitting around with Lawrence Buell, *The Ecocriticism Reader*, and *The Country and the City*, but additional suggestions would be much appreciated. Obviously I will be scouring their bibliographies, but specific suggestions would be helpful.\n\n(3) I need non-fiction primary sources (part of that process of making the course available to students of all disciplines). I'm thinking Rousseau, Locke, de las Casas, maybe Columbus, and then I'm pretty much clueless. In particular, I want primary sources from *and* about First Nations (things like idleness, efficiency, land use, relationships to land, myth-making, etc.). I also wouldn't mind suggestions for reading the environment in terms of slavery and gender, but I feel more competent in those areas.\n\nOkay, I feel like after putting this post together I have just embarrassed myself more than anything. At any rate, much help is needed and I would be deeply grateful. Thank you in advance.",

Up until this semester I wanted my other major to be history, I never considered english until I took a American Lit. class this semester. I did okay (b's) on my first two basic english class, they were kind of interesting. But I can say this American Lit. class is by far my favorite class I've ever taken in college and I'm a junior. In the class I was especially interested in the transcendental writers (Emerson, Thoreau, Fuller). I wrote my term paper on Thoreau's \"Resistance to Civil Government\" and I have never been so enthusiastic about a paper before this one, in fact the minimum was 1700 words and I wrote almost 3500. In the class I did not do as well on the objective tests as I wanted to. But on the in-class essays I did well and I got extra points for writing good essays. I feel like I do better on written assignments than I do objective tests. I'm still not confident in my writing though, I take a long time forming sentences. I also really enjoyed Hawthorne's \"A Minister's Black Veil\" and \"The Birthmark\". I am taking the second part of this literature class next semester, so I guess I will see if i enjoy that one before making a decision. I'm just confused because I've never been interested in literature, as much, until now. Also last year I started to read leisurely (outside of school) for the first time. \n\nI guess my main questions are: \n\n1) What can I expect in more advanced literature courses?\n\n2) What can I do to improve my writing or just become more confident in my writing?\n\n3) What kind of job opportunities would I have? (i'm considering law school)\n\n\nThanks for reading!!\n \n**Edited for grammer mistakes (feel free to point more out to me)**",

He draws on Nietszche to list the qualities and spiritual values one must have to achieve this. My argument is that the passive nature of the Flaneur, turns the figure into a narrative of modernity, and the differentiated man is one who possesses these qualities but ultimately has some sort of goal, endpoint or aim.\n\nAny further reading, questions, help or anything would be appreciated.",
