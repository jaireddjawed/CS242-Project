        "text": "(Edit) For people still reading this [here](https://youtu.be/TzbZJTqiaOw) is a video explaining exactly what I’m talking about. Make sure to watch it until the end to get the whole story!\n\nI’ve been following a man named Brien Foerster for a while now. He has been in Paracas, Peru for a few years examining the hundreds of elongated skulls that have been found there. [here](https://youtu.be/JnERUZNqwbc) is a video that shows the clear differences between our skulls and the skulls that have been found. \nThere has been a full [DNA research](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMmawVi0KpXFuTD7hmxSDIMmdW3esXe_-) on these skulls for the people who think this is pseudoscience. And to counter the argument that these ancient people deformed their skulls on purpose. Yes that is true. Brien Foerster tells us about these deformed skulls and shows the difference between real elongated skulls and purposely deformed ones. The fact remains that you cannot change your skull capacity by deforming your skull. Because that is imprinted in your DNA. You can however, alter the shape of your skull.  \n(If you find this interesting I recommend you check Brien Foerster’s videos on youtube and maybe buy his book if you are interested in the details of the DNA results). \n\nI know what I’m going to say doesn’t fit into the conventional paradigm but please keep an open mind while reading. Your beliefs are not being attacked. \n\nIt’s clear that we have a bit of trouble with finding our last common ancestor (LCA). Also known as the “[the missing link](http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20170517-we-have-still-not-found-the-missing-link-between-us-and-apes)”. Correct me if I’m wrong but I’ve read it’s because the difference, between the ancestors of the human species and those who came before us, is just to drastic. There had to be something in between that shows a gradual change into what we have become now. \n\nOne of the biggest changes I’ve read about is brain size. Specifically the cerebral cortex. In the animal kingdom there seems to be a link between the size of the cerebral cortex and intelligence. And I’m talking about the intelligence that humans express. \n\nCheck the video to see the difference in size of our cerebral cortex compared to other mammals (and chimpanzee). [skip to 1:42:10 for explanation about cerebral cortex](https://youtu.be/m2EtLk7VyI4). I also recommend you to watch the whole video but first, let me explain a little bit more. \n\nSo here we are searching for our common ancestor. Looking everywhere. Under/in every rock but still without any results. \n\nBUT what we did discover is a human species with a bigger brain volume than ours and way heavier skulls. \nAnd I’m not talking about a slight increase I’m talking about skull capacities up to 25%  bigger than ours and 60% heavier! And they seem to have only 2 cranial plates instead of 3 like we have. And the foramen magnum (hole where nerves enter the skull) is placed differently. So this has to be something DNA related. You can’t tell me you can change all this by binding your head with something. Crazy that this is not all over the news. And these skulls have been catching dust since 1928 or 1938!! Can I get a salute for my man Brien🙌🏽. \nI understand that there where other human species with bigger skulls hundreds of thousands of years ago maybe millions. But these skulls are no older than 2000 years and lived among the mayans.  \n\nQUICK HISTORY LESSON:\nWe all know about the ancient egyptian empires who left the great pyramids of Giza and many other mysteries behind. But there is a civilization who, according to scientist, started about a 1000 years earlier. They are called the [Sumerians](https://www.google.nl/amp/amp.history.com/news/history-lists/9-things-you-may-not-know-about-the-ancient-sumerians). I’ve posted a quick link but you can write a whole book series about this civilization. (Like zachariah stitching did) :). \nBut the main thing I want to address about this Mesopotamian civilization is what they have written down as the beginning of mankind. \n\nBuckle up cause here I go. And remember, an open mind. \n\nThe Sumerians have written down in cuneiform on clay tablets ([sumerian tablets story of creation](http://www.ancient-origins.net/human-origins-folklore/origins-human-beings-according-ancient-sumerian-texts-0065)) that more advanced, human looking beings came to earth (some other ancient civilizations say from beneath the earth) and they modified the already existing humanoids that were roaming the planet long before us... I know it’s a lot to swallow but bare with me. The Sumerians wrote these stories down and accepted this as 100% truth. (Not me\nbut I’m not saying it’s 100% false). Even the beings that accomplished this genetic modification where described still living amongst the people. \nBtw they called these beings the Anunnaki. Roughly translated in would mean something like: those who came from above or something like that. \n\nOk let’s stop for a sec. there are two thing you could say at this moment. \n1. These people where smoking something we cannot even imagine and made this all up. All these complex stories about our past and origin. \n2. They meant what they said and said what they meant. \n\nPlease do keep in mind (or research) how advanced this civilization was. It’s almost stupid to say they didn’t meant what they were writing down in such detail... I mean, at a certain point you have to draw a line between someones imagination or a possible true source of inspiration. \n\nLet’s continue. \n\nThe reason I brought up the missing link is because I wanted the people who read this to see the last common ancestor problem from another perspective. \nThe problem right now is that the difference (mostly in size) of the human brain and those of the species that came before us is just to big. There is a gap. \n\nNow the possible theory to fill this gap:\nWhat if there was a human species with an even larger brain or skull capacity roaming the planet. Like the skulls we found. And they would genetically alter a humanoid,with a very small brain, to look more like them. \n- Again. this is what the Sumerians wrote down and scholars even claim this is where the biblical sentence: Make man in our image. Comes from.-\nBut by mixing a bigger brain than our own, with a smaller brain than our own. Wouldn’t you get something in between those two? Maybe something like our brain? Could it be that instead of a missing link that is behind us in the evolution, it could be ahead of us? \nI would like to ask you, if you have a PhD in this field or not, to play with this thought for a second. And I would really like to hear your opinion about it!\n\n\nFor those who think: If there was such a civilization why wouldn’t they left something behind? \nWell someone did, ever heard about [Gobekli Tepe?](http://gobeklitepe.info) It’s a huge ancient megalithic structure that predates stone hedge with 6000 years! We supposed have invented basic pottery then. We in fact keep finding remnants of something or someone more advanced than the humans that were supposed to be present in those days. \nAnd we’ve got the Giza pyramids. We still cannot explain how the ancient Egyptians build it. And after the Giza pyramids (which were one of the first and most sophisticated pyramids) the level of architecture only decreased. You would imagine that the people would learn from their previous work and keep improving it. Unless they didn’t built it themselves. And want to replicate the builders.  \n\nPlease don’t forget about the factual data I presented like: \n1. The DNA results of the elongated skulls. \n2. The writings of the Sumerians. \n3. Ancient megalithic structures that don’t fit within the present story of history. \n\nNow from my past experience some people will get mad when I post controversial stuff like this. So if you are reading this and want to bite me for thinking about lesser explored territories in science. Please do not comment in the comment section below because it’s a waste of everybody’s time. \n\nI want to thank you for taking the time to read this essay like post😂 please share this with whoever you think will find this subject interesting and at least spread the word about the Paracas skulls because it is a proven fact they exist.\n\nPEACE. \n\n\n(Update) \nFor the people who are reading this. I’m not going to respond anymore but make sure to check the comments for some interesting debates. I still firmly believe there was a knowledge presented to us at a certain point in time. I never said this were alien or whatever words people put into my mouth. I’m saying there could be a lineage of humanoids that we can learn a lot from. If we really build our knowledge up to the point to where we could build the Pyramids of Giza (one of the first pyramids built) with all its astrological alignments and lazercut precision. Why did our knowledge decreased. Not 1 structure has the same sophisticated architecture after the Pyramids of Giza were build. The technology used suddenly disappeared. Check [this](https://youtu.be/r8LgcQ29aoQ) video so you can laugh in the faces of those telling you they did it with stone hammers and chisels. Remember to always keep an open mind and stay true to yourself.

I've been taught, among other possibilities, that this may be attributed to competition or perhaps interbreeding, but I have also been taught that the interbreeding does not seem to have occurred too frequently due to the DNA existing in small amounts (although I also hear this could be the result of many of natural selection selecting out the DNA we received from them as unfavorable). What I am wondering is in what way the differing appearances, if they differed a significant amount at all between the two, could have had an effect on how likely it was for interbreeding or hostile competition to take place. In other words, is it possible that one perceived the other, or both saw each other, as distinctly different enough in appearance to warrant a bias against interacting, cooperating, or breeding? Or would these differences have been wedged by cultural practices alone, if at all? To clarify I am not attempting to steer this towards HBD (far from it), but whether or not phenotype and or cultural differences could have been complicating variables in the social interaction/cooperation between the two groups despite their underlying genetic relationship.",

It seemed to me too complicated and risky to go study abroad without better knowledge of a foreign language, without knowing exactly where to study (and therefore, why in there), etc.\n\nBut well, today I said, **** this, I'd like to at least give it a try. And here I am, because as soon as I got into a couple of websites I got dizzy again. There's so much I don't understand. So, I have a few questions that maybe someone in here can help me with.\nBut, first: I'm curious and find most topics interesting, but I think it's fair to say I lean towards Social Anthropology, and specially like specially politics and economics topics, as vague as that is. The 'final project' for my undergraduate explores how people in a consumer cooperative organize themselves to make it work, how cohesion of the group is built and what conflicts arises in it. So:\n\n- How do I find out where I'd like to study? I know a few well-known names, but not much more, and I've asked colleagues and professors here but most of them have told me that there weren't there or simply don't know, and that I should ask someone else. I've tried to compare programs, but there's so much, and I easily get lost.\n\n- Admissions, application and general university system, which  outside of Spain. I'm most interested in US and UK, but that's only because I don't know much about other places. I'd be happy to be told about anywhere else. I speak Catalan, Spanish and English (B2-FCE, altough that was years ago and I think I'm probably at C1 level), and a tiny bit of German. Being in April, I'm aware I'm probably on last call tops, but I might just get lucky.\n\n- Scholarships or job-finding help, as I'm not much buoyant. I'm working atm in Barcelona but I'm seriously preoccupied about this, as I've been going around the undergraduate with top grades, which gives you a discount for next year (Matrícula de Honor, not quite sure 'graduating with honors' is a valid equivalent in English), but I fear I might not be able to keep with that in a foreign university and with a foreign language. Also, I'd love to focus on studying, as naive as that might be!\n\nI'm probably forgetting a lot here, but I think this is enough. I'll edit and add more or simply follow on comments if there's any answer. Thanks!",

        "text": "Steven Pinker is said to claim language acquisition is one. I was reading the following section of the wikipedia entry on instinct and couldn't find a clear answer:\n\n&gt;The term \"instinct\" in psychology was first used in the 1870s by Wilhelm Wundt. By the close of the 19th century, most repeated behavior was considered instinctual. In a survey of the literature at that time, one researcher chronicled 4,000 human \"instincts,\" having applied this label to any behavior that was repetitive.[citation needed] As research became more rigorous and terms better defined, instinct as an explanation for human behavior became less common. In a conference in 1960, chaired by Frank Beach, a pioneer in comparative psychology, and attended by luminaries in the field, the term was restricted in its application.[citation needed] During the 1960s and 1970s, textbooks still contained some discussion of instincts in reference to human behavior. By the year 2000, a survey of the 12 best selling textbooks in Introductory Psychology revealed only one reference to instincts, and that was in regard to Sigmund Freud's referral to the \"id\" instincts.[citation needed]. In this sense, instincts appeared to have become regarded as increasingly superfluous in trying to understand human psychological behavior.\n\n&gt;Psychologist Abraham Maslow argued that humans no longer have instincts because we have the ability to override them in certain situations. He felt that what is called instinct is often imprecisely defined, and really amounts to strong drives. For Maslow, an instinct is something which cannot be overridden, and therefore while the term may have applied to humans in the past, it no longer does.[3]\n\n&gt;The book Instinct (1961) established a number of criteria which distinguish instinctual from other kinds of behavior. To be considered instinctual, a behavior must: a) be automatic, b) be irresistible, c) occur at some point in development, d) be triggered by some event in the environment, e) occur in every member of the species, f) be unmodifiable, and g) govern behavior for which the organism needs no training (although the organism may profit from experience and to that degree the behavior is modifiable).[4]\n\n&gt;In a classic paper published in 1972,[5] the psychologist Richard Herrnstein decries Fabre's opinions on instinct",

        "text": "As everybody should know by now even if many people regrettably don't, scholars in anthropology have widely rejected the once-ubiquitous theoretical category of \"tribe\" for at least half a century now as an analytically questionable, oversimplistic, misleading, or even implicitly/explicitly racist catch-all blanket term for an impossibly broad array of non-state or state-adjacent forms of social organization, and as a byword for Western colonialist discourses against which many in the field have done quite a lot of soul-searching. The anthropological literature is pretty clear dating back to influential work by scholars like [Morton Fried](https://nyaspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.2164-0947.1966.tb02369.x) or [Aidan Southall](http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/journals/10.1163/15685217-90007037), the Cambridge Encyclopedia of Anthropology has [a solid entry by David Sneath](http://www.anthroencyclopedia.com/entry/tribe), and I've seen [good popular-facing articles](http://africanactivist.msu.edu/document_metadata.php?objectid=32-130-153D) from outlets associated with Africana studies, but what I haven't seen is mainline Western anthropologists producing short and accessible critiques aimed at a non-academic or at least non-anthropologist audience, to bluntly and directly confront the colonial-era notion of \"tribe\" that still survives in the mainstream Western public imagination. Even someone like James C. Scott, probably one of the anthropologically-literate scholars with the broadest influence among non-anthropologists today, buries his critique of \"tribe\" in a popular-facing book like *Against the Grain* in the middle of a larger discourse on state and nonstate societies, instead of lingering on the term itself.\n\nPart of why this seems important is because as Sneath hints at the end of his entry, outdated notions of \"tribe\" still survive and thrive outside of anthropology, in other social-scientific disciplines to a certain extent, but especially in the more cod-scholarly strains of middlebrow popular work by authors like Jonathan Haidt or Amy Chua. The common maneuver is to take long-discarded anthropological stereotypes as unproblematic received wisdom, then spin them as mere particular manifestations of an underlying Platonic-ideal form called \"tribalism\", which in turn gets spun in vintage Santa Barbara evopsych \"just-so story\" terms as a deep-seated social instinct for rigid inflexible in-group loyalty and out-group hostility, allegedly hard-wired into our innate genetic endowment of human nature through our evolutionary origins in the cutthroat Hobbesian state of nature, [and so on and so on etc etc you know the drill ^(please kill me now)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypEaGQb6dJk). And as much or as little as I've seen anthropologists grapple with the notion of \"tribe\" in different settings, I've *never* seen an anthropologist link this to a direct critique of non-anthropologists' theories about some underlying psychological/biological force called \"tribalism\", let alone in an accessible setting for a lay audience.\n\nBy my interpretation, not only is the mainstream \"tribalism\" narrative out of step with decades' worth of modern anthropology, it ultimately serves a far-reaching and deeply pernicious ideological agenda: to defend contemporary political tendencies like white supremacy (even if the surface-level goal is to denounce or disavow them) as grounded in innate and unchangeable human nature, obscuring their historical contingency as relatively recent social constructions that can be made *or unmade* through conscious political action. This seems to me like an area where anthropologists could potentially play a much more positive and constructive \"mythbusting\" role in mainstream discourses than they currently are — so either (1) am I misinterpreting something about the underlying theoretical problems in anthropology, (2) am I overlooking an existing body of anthropologist-authored or at least anthropologically-informed popular literature that fits my description, (3) am I not cognizant enough of any broad institutional/discursive imperatives that might be preventing anthropologists as a \"tribe\" (ha ha ha) from tackling a project like this, or (4) am I right to suspect that this might be a promising and invaluable area for some enterprising and articulate anthropologist(s) to try to break into the mainstream Western pop-social-science circuit?",

        "text": " I'd like to get educated on human prehistory.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nMy interests on the topic are broad, but can probably be organized into a few key topics: The major differences between homo sapiens &amp; our ancestors, why we are the only homo species left, why humans switched from hunting-gathering to agriculture, how inequality entered society, the process by which government, states, cities, and empires formed. \n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nI started off by reading The Mind in the Cave &amp; Lifeways of Hunter Gatherers. They were both excellent books that gave a broad perspective on larger concepts. I suspect The Lifeways of Hunter Gatherers will be particularly useful, because it provided a lot of interesting mathematical data on why people on a large scale would move from a mobile to a sedentary lifestyle. However, I realized that I should probably organize myself a bit better in terms of trying to answer the above questions in some type of order that makes sense. I assembled a bunch of recommendations after scouring the internet, and come up with these books which seem interesting &amp; have generally high ratings. I'm assuming some of the information contained within books with such similar topics is redundant, and it would become low yield to read all of them. I was wondering if people versed in the field could give me some opinions on which of these are the shining stars in the pack. I would also love any additional recommendations for any stand out books that are missing surrounding these topics. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\nEarly Paleolithic\n\n1.

Recently I have seen unroasted, and more expensive cacao beans promoted as having promoting health beyond what would be expected with the use of the cocoa powder and chocolates commonly available in the west, even when these have low sugar levels.  Did Europeans invent cacao roasting, or is this traditional for Native Americans as well?  Did some Native American groups roast cacao, while others would consume it raw?  I have seen contradictory information on the topic.\n\nI always try to ensure that I consider traditional methods of food preparation in planning my diet because I have seen Westerners, including my own mother when I was growing up, seize on various foreign or traditional, but out of fashion foods without properly considering how they need to be handled for digestibility and the removal of plant toxins, causing more health problems then they prevent.  Accordingly, rather than just assuming that 'raw is better,' I would like to know how Native Americans, including, but not limited to the Kuna, actually processed their cacao.",

This post will reference a couple of the articles brought up in their exchange.\n\nIn his [second co-authored Vox article](https://www.vox.com/the-big-idea/2017/6/15/15797120/race-black-white-iq-response-critics) responding to Harris' infamous 'Forbidden Knowledge' podcast episode with *The Bell Curve* author Charles Murray, Prof. Richard Nisbett argued the black-white gap had narrowed to 9.5 points from the roughly 16 point difference at the time of Murray's book.\n\nI emailed Nisbett recently and he not only stood by this claim, but said that he believed the gap may have shrunken even further recently.\n\nHowever [a blog post](https://medium.com/@houstoneuler/the-cherry-picked-science-in-voxs-charles-murray-article-bd534a9c4476) Nisbett responds to in the Vox piece criticised this number and suggested that the very study by James Flynn Nisbett was citing actually still cited a 16 point gap.\n\nI then emailed Prof. Flynn and he confounded this further to me by claiming that the 9.5. gap was correct for 17-year-old test takers in 2008, but that the number for adults was still 16 points. I did not get a confirmation from him whether this was the result, fittingly, of the Flynn effect and that these teens would've carried these gains with them into adulthood, or whether the gap grew with age.\n\nI next found a study from 2013 that claimed the gap was just under 10 points (see the last paragraph for the section on Wikipedia for [Race and intelligence#Flynn effect and closing the gap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_intelligence#Flynn_effect_and_the_closing_gap), but when I emailed one of its authors Dr. James Thompson he told me that since that study he had come to the conclusion that his numbers were wrong an the difference is still 16 points.\n\nSo... what the fuck is going on here?
