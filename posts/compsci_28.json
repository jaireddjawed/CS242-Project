Ideally the signals would be wireless / I am not sure how this would work out so I am open to book suggestions on the topic (brain computer interfacing / passing message to hardware?)\nShould my first prototype be on a smaller instrument such as a xylophone? I was thinking the final version would be on an automatic piano (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Player_piano) \nAny thoughts you may have to fill in my hardware shaped hole would be appreciated,\n\nMany thanks in advance for your help ",

        "text": "Hi, I hope that a Software Engineering question will be allowed here, too.\n\nI'm in progress of writing my thesis. It aims to deal with estimating some costs related to migration of an application to cloud and tries to optimize the overall cost of the process. The overall framework aims to be limited to a narrow class of enterprise applications with given architecture (think CRUD applications with conventional aplication server + any SQL database, backups, replication - and so on). At the point I'm at now, I have lots of quantitative metrics extracted over the course of analysis. \n\nWhat I need at this point is some kind of method, however crude or inaccurate, which would attempt to estimate hardware requirements having the knowledge given above. Or any method from the domain of software engineering which would allow me to calculate any kind of estimate for the minimum hardware specification. Having only found methods for estimating costs of developing the solution itself (COCOMO, FP etc.) I'm starting to get afraid that my expectations are too far-fetched.\n\nMy question to you is as follow: Have you stumbled upon a paper which would describe something similar to what I'm talking about?",

        "text": "Hey guys,\nI'm reading through *The Algorithm Design Manual* by Skiena and I have a misunderstanding about checking for graph isomorphism. Definition of a graph isomorphism is (by the book, page 550):\n\n`Find a (or all) mapping f from the vertices of G to the vertices of H such that G and H are identical; i.e. , (x, y) is an edge of G iff (f(x), f(y)) is an edge of H.`\n\nHowever, when the author explains how to proceed with constructing the algorithm of finding the isomorphism, he says:\n\n`Although no worst-case polynomial-time algorithm is known, testing isomorphism is usually not very hard in practice. The basic algorithm backtracks through all n! possible relabelings of the vertices of graph h with the names of vertices of graph g, and then tests whether the graphs are identical. Of course, we can prune the search of all permutations with a given prefix as soon as we detect any mismatch between edges whose vertices are both in the prefix.`\n\nThe thing that bothers me is this:\n\n&gt; all n! possible relabelings of the vertices of graph h with the names of vertices of graph g\n\nWhy do we relabel the vertices? Aren't vertex names arbitrary? Shouldn't we exchange *edge weights* instead of vertex names (labels)? This doesn't hold for when the graph is unweighted. \n\nIf the graph is unweighted, then I wouldn't exchange the edge weights, but rather go through all vertices of one graph (one by one) and check if there is a vertex with a matching number of edges in the second graph. If there is, I would \"cross it off\" (maybe by setting some `bool` array element equaling the index of that node equal to `false`) and then I'd proceed. No relabeling needed. Time complexity O(n^2).\n\nLet me know what you think.",
