        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/110ldj0/ive_made_a_proof_that_life_after_death_exists_is/",
        "text": "I've made a proof that life after death exists (or at least that you have some experience/qualia after you die). I can't see any fault in my reasoning. Even if I'm wrong, I'm curious what's wrong with that reasoning...\n\nHere's the reasoning.\n\nThe typical atheist mindset goes like this:\n\n1. There is a universe.\n2. Before you were born, you hadn't had any experience, there were no qualia because you hadn't existed yet.\n3. Then you were born.\n4. Then you are alive for a very short time comparing to the entire time of the existence of the universe (you live 70 years, the universe exists for billions years and will exist for billions years).\n5. Then you die.\n6. And then there will be nothing again - you won't experience anything, there won't be any qualia.\n\nI'll prove that it can't be true (or that it's very unlikely).\n\nImagine that you have a box. You know that there are yellow and blue balls in that box and nothing else. Let's suppose that there is John. You know that when John tells a statement, it's true 99% of times. So John tells you that in that box, there are 999 999 999 blue balls and 1 yellow ball. Now imagine that you sample one ball out of the box and it's a yellow ball. Given the fact that you have sampled a yellow ball, the statement that John told you is most likely wrong (even despite the fact that John is right 99% of times). That could be mathematically shown using Bayes theorem or something similar.\n\nAnalogically, the current moment which we have now (12 February 2023) is a random moment out of all moments of the universe existence (analogically, the sampled ball is a random ball out of all balls in the box). The typical atheist mindset (presented above) implies that you exist only for a very small fraction of the universe existence. Therefore, presuming the typical atheist mindset, it's extremely improbable that the current moment (which is a random moment out of all moments of the universe existence) happens to be a moment in which you exist (which is only a tiny fraction of all moments, according to the typical atheist mindset). Given that you exist in the current moment (which is the case), it's extremely improbable that you exist only for a very small fraction of the universe existence. Therefore, the typical atheist mindset is very improbable (with probability being close to 0).\n\nTherefore, you must have existed before you were born or will exist after you die for a significant part of the universe existence. Or maybe our perception of time is incorrect, but the typical atheist mindset (as presented above) must be wrong because it leads to a conclusion that is very unlikely to be true.\n\nIf my line of reasoning is unclear, please let me know - I will make it more clear.\n\nWith a similar reasoning, it can be deducted that it's very unlikely that you are right at the beginning of your existence or right at the end of your existence. So you have existed before you were born and you will exist after you die.\n\nCould you please let me know if you agree with my line of reasoning or do you see a fault in it?",

For example Nagata, Nakayama.\n\nRecently I also heard about Polish space (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_space), named after Poland because of the set/logic theory gang there. \n\nI wonder if there are any other objects named like this? In honour of a group of mathematicians instead of just one. It's impossible to Google it because I can't just search {country}+{mathematical object} aimlessly so I'd like to ask here. It can also be named after things other than a country. The history behind will be interesting as well I believe.",

        "text": "Hi, sorry if this is the wrong sub. Just saw a card trick from a friend and spent some few hours trying to figure it out. He told me there’s some math involved.\n\nSo\n\n1. We have a deck of 52 cards shuffled, now the person performing the trick has a look at the deck for a few seconds.\n\n2. The K,Q,J and Ace all have a value of 10. You begin making 4 piles of cards, starting from pile 1, where if the starting card for example is a 7 of any, now you have to place cards 6 cards in that pile.\n\n3. Now move on to the next pile, place the first card, it falls to a random number (example 4) now place 3 cards.\n\n4. Repeat upto 4 cards.\n\nNote: If the first card is a card of value 10 i.e K,Q,J,A you can move to the next pile. \n\n5. Now if you add all the numbers of the first card in our case above it is\n\n7+4+ (some number) 5 + (some number) 10 = 26\n\nIn the 26th position he guesses which card is present.\n\nNote: The person has looked at the deck for 5-7 seconds in the beginning after shuffling.\n\nTIA!",

        "text": "You might've seen thee recent veritasium video about this: https://youtu.be/XeSu9fBJ2sI\n\nThe problem goes as follows: \"sleeping beauty has volunteered for an experiment,  she is told beforehand how it goes. A Coin is flipped, if it comes up tails she is woken up twice, if heads she's woken up once. She can't remember past wakings. When woken up she's asked: \"what is the probability the coin landed heads?\" What is the answer to this question?\"\n\nSo i came up with a solution based on simple probability that includes both views of the problem (this is a copy paste from the comment i left on the video btw):\n\nThis problem can be divided in \"events\" and \"measurements\".\nIf she knows there wil only be 1 performed experiment then there is a 1/2 chance for it to be heads, since there is 1 event for which all measurements agree either way.\nWith 2 experiments we get 1/4 for full agreement and a 1/2 chance that 1/3 of the measurements is heads. So the chance is 5/12. With 3 it's 31/80. This converges to 1/3 as the amount of experiments approaches infinity.\n\nNow, if we don't know how many experiments will be performed, then we have to average the probability spread of the amount of experiments. If we assume an even spread, then despite every value being greater than 1/3, the average of all values to infinity is 1/3. So if we take the simplest way of not knowing how many experiments will be performed then the probability is 1/3.",

        "text": "Most math people I know had some \"discovery\" or crank result they were really proud of when they were younger.\n\nThis was my story:\n\nWhen I was in middle school, I stumbled across the \"result\" that for certain x, x\\^x\\^x\\^... converges to a y satisfying y\\^(1/y)=x. After some experimentation, I discovered that formally:\n\nx\\^(1/x)\\^(1/x)\\^...=y such that y\\^y=x.\n\nHaving heard of tetration, I was extremely excited to have found such an inverse function and thought I was onto something big. \n\nAfter trying several values in my calculator, I discovered the interval of convergence was ((1/e)\\^(1/e), e\\^e). But when x&gt;e\\^e, it did something really bizarre - it alternated between approaching two values 'a' and 'b' such that a\\^b=b\\^a=x!\n\nI didn't have the language of calculus yet, but I did have a graphing calculator that showed me that the maximum of x\\^(1/x) occurred at e. And intuitively, sliding down the line f(x)=c from c=e to c=1 and looking at the intersections with f(x)=x\\^(1/x), you'd get the values of 'a' and 'b' for increasingly larger 'x', from e\\^e to infinity.\n\nI had no idea how to prove any of this, and so began my journey into learning higher level of mathematics as quickly as possible. In parallel, kept trying to generalize this to higher orders of tetration but wasn't successful until a few years into high school when I had more mathematical maturity. Unfortunately, by generalizing it I also realized the triviality of the whole thing - just start with a\\_n\\^{a\\_{n-1}}=x and solve for a\\_n. And so I didn't think more of the problem for over a decade, even though the behavior remained \"unproven\".\n\nRecently though, I started browsing this subreddit more and got nostalgic seeing other people post their \"crank research\". After a bit of searching, I found an easy theorem that showed how to determine the stability of fixed points and it was just algebra from there (viewing two iterations as a single iteration for x&gt;e\\^e). So after 13 years, the case was finally closed.\n\nWhat were your childhood \"research\" results?",
