        "text": "Ever since the Magna Carta, English Royalty appears to be on a long slow slide to irrelevancy. Today royals really only have ceremonial duties and powers; the aristocracy has even less. \n\nAmericans tend to paint King George III as a villain, but how involved was he, really? Other media points at the king as a sort of non-entity sitting above everything while various parliamentary ministers to about the work. Ignoring the regency where he maybe went mad (unless the regency/madness had a real impact on my question, which would make sense) what could the king really do back in ~1780-1810, and what could parliament do? \n\nSimilarly, how did the aristocracy fit in? At some point they stopped being local rulers and became just rich guys and landlords, so what actual powers beyond lease contracts and access to capital did a duke or earl have?",

        "text": "Hello,\n\nI come from an academic background in English Literature. Recently I've been reading a lot more, especially history. In the English world, I'd often hear how important it was to read the right books. \n\nSo, I'm wondering what the \"right\" books are. I understand my wondering is sort of broad, here, so I'll ask more specific questions to get the ball rolling, but I really am curious about the field as a whole, so please don't treat these questions as all I'm asking about:\n\n1. I've always been curious about Russian/Soviet history, but I'm deeply skeptical of the texts I read, as they are from an American perspective, which I assume is pretty intensely biased. What books/writers can I trust on this topic?\n\n2. Are there any books that write about the methodology of Soviet/Russian history? Or, more broadly: Do methodologies differ subject to subject?\n\n3. I'm also incredibly interested in Mexican history, especially areas which have been both American/Mexican. But really, I'm just ignorant on Mexican history as a whole, and I'm worried about finding texts that are largely written from a colonial perspective.\n\nAs I said, I'm curious about other books too. Thanks for taking the time to respond to this post. Love the content y'all generate.",

But my understanding (which may be wrong!) is that ideas about Noahide laws and a Noahide covenant with God didn't come into existence until much later - like Talmud era.\n\nSo we've got kind of an awkward period of about 400 BCE to about 200 CE (to maybe up to 600 CE) where I am not totally sure about Jewish views of pagans. Obviously, I know that Jews didn't want pagans to impose their gods on the Jews, and didn't want Jews worshiping pagan gods - but what did Jews think of foreign pagans (not living in Judah/Judea) worshiping their own gods in this period? Do we have any information about it? Were \"good\" pagans supposed to acknowledge Yahweh as either supreme god/the only god?",

I'm familiar with the intellectual roots of neoliberalism — the Mont-Pèlerin Socierty, etc — but not how those ideas managed to become dominant.\n\nAmerican Keynesian policy was a response to the Great Depression and the crisis of liberal values, and West European postwar dirigist policy was seen as the best way to rebuild and modernize the economy as well as to ensure a safeguard against the reemergence of fascism. What was neoliberalism a response to? Why did that response eventually stick?\n\nI sometime hear about the stagflation caused by the oil shocks being related, but I'm afraid I can't make the connection.

So, which is true?\n\nHonestly, [u/commiespaceinvader](https://www.reddit.com/u/commiespaceinvader/)'s response seems like it aged like milk in the light of the war in Ukraine and its admitted genocidal aim, along with Russia's denial of the existence of a Ukrainian identity. The phrase \"the Ukraine\" makes me especially uneasy, given how Ukrainians feel this phrase is used in Russia to dehumanize the local population and suggest that Ukraine is just a place rather than a nation state.",

And if so, which those states would be.\n\n**Which were, precisely, the proposed splits that were considered by this committee?** The only proposed separations of Germany post-1945 that I could find were the Morgenthau plan, Churchill's Danube Confederation idea, and the effective East-West separation that I believe resulted more from the occupation zones + start of the cold war, rather than a plan put forth by this committee.",
