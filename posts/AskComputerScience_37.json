I love the programming classes, along with the linux/ubuntu courses, and even don't mind some of the networking/switches courses.\n\nHow ever I have like 4-5 other courses that are basically just different variations of System design/ UML diagrams/ OOP Analysis Charts. I cannot for the life of me pay attention in these courses . I don't know what it is but they literally bore me to tears. I would much rather be doing any of the above, and its almost to the point now where I cant even be bothered to go to the class some times let a lone take time out of my programming projects to do the work. I guess what i'm asking is how important are these classes in the long run, Its pretty bad for me now because I have finished all but the enterprise level of programming course, in which after completing I was thinking of just applying to jobs without actually finishing all the courses. \n\nI really can't see my self spending another 2 semesters doing what seems to be the same thing but just in different variations.",

I decided to go with EE even though I was more than half way in my CS career but my gpa did take a hit and so I just graduated in EE. I really should of just stayed in my CS program and continue to finish it but that's too late now as re-entry at my university seems impossible for a second major after post graduation.\n\nI'm currently in the industry for rf hardware due to my ee background. Not really liking it so much so I'm trying to switch to software. What should I be doing to prepare for software interviews? How can I bulk up my resume to become a viable contender? My only experience for software is an internship that dealt with Java unit testing and some undergrad research dealing with python in the past. I program on the side for fun but nothing truly competitive like a full blown app. Languages I focus in are C and Java, some php and sql for db management. \n\nAm I on the right track? Or is it just a matter of aggressively applying? Would I have more luck with larger or smaller companies?\n\n",

I just need to know what those areas are.\n\nBackground if you're curious. The classes are available as electives but there's a limit to how many electives you can take at each year level. First year is one elective module a semester deciding to take classes I enjoy (physics 1 and 2) ate up both the slots. And I can't go back because I won't get the required credits at higher levels.\n\nHigh school didn't cover anything more complicated than working out standard deviation and left out statistics completely and the only reason I've heard of induction is my calculus class spent a couple of weeks on the basics. \n\n",

I can't go into too much detail about the project (school patents, etc) but it involves developing a genetic algorithm (in Matlab or C++) with our experimental results. Our plan is to go about changing parameters and running our experiments and collecting data and developing a genetic algorithm to have a tool that can give us the ideal parameter settings for a specified end value (without the need for experiments, accurately). \n\n**My dilemma**:  \n\nI don't have a solid background in computer science theory or really advanced math past Calc 3/chemical engineering courses. So it's really difficult trying to decipher how to start working on the algorithm. I have experience in C++ and Matlab so syntax/actually programming isn't that much of a concern, but a lot of the studying I've done on GAs seems broad and I'm having trouble seeing how I could apply it to my project, but a GA is definitely the route I'm going. Does anyone have any tips on how I can learn to code a GA? How would I learn this without a formal course? I have 4 months left of the project but I want to use the next few months to work on it at home so I can hit the ground running coming back. \n\nAdditionally, if anyone has any helpful resources for me I would really appreciate it! \n\nThanks :-)\n\n",

The author names Haskel, HTML, MishMash, Piet and INTERCAL (which I now know is a joke) as esolangs, and goes on to say that they will become more necessary in the future to prevent computers from coding themselves as they require human creativity. \n\nThe rest of the article just talks about what coding is, why we need it and lists differences between Java, C, Adel, Python etc. \n\nWhen I did my initial search before publication, there was not a lot of info on esolangs, so what was said seemed reasonable to me. \n\nMy questions are: Have I been trolled, has the author just used bad examples of esolangs and overestimated their importance, or are the commenters unfamiliar with the practical uses for esolangs and only for jokes?

I started thinking that it would make sense to move on and do a masters in cyber-security after that as I find that stuff interesting and apparently there's good money + a lack of people doing it(from what I understand). My research has told me that MS in cyber/network security isn't actually that common, or maybe I'm not looking in the right place. \n\nSo my question is; do I have the right idea? Is getting a masters is the way to go and I just need to find a program? Would it make more sense to just get certs? Should I even get a 4-year degree or should I just get certs? Any other advice that hadn't even crossed my mind?\n\nThanks all.",

I am having to learn proofs by wrote because I am struggling with the course (harsh marker, no help, no lecture notes). They have defined the problem as: \n\nDefine a switch function to be a function S: (alphabet to alphabet) (not necessarily a bijection). E.g. it switches the letters of a word with other letters in the same alphabet. x is a member of the kleene star alphabet, and S(x) = S(x_1)S(x_2)... and so on. L is a language over this alphabet. Show that if L is in NP, so is S(L). \n\nHonestly don't even know where to start.

If 10 dB = 1/10 of the signal, then 20 dB is equal to 1/100 of the signal, isn't it?\n\nThe only conclusion I can draw from this is that it is the noise which is decrementing, right? So 10 dB essentially equals 1 part 'noise' for every 10 'signals'? 13 dB = \"1 part noise for every 20 signals\", 20 dB = \"1 part noise for every 100 signals\". Is that correct?\n\nIf so, my equation should be:\n\nC = (10 * 10^6) * log2(19.9526231497 + 1)\n\nC = (10 * 10^6) * log2(20.9526231497)\n\nC = (10 * 10^6) * 4.38905896736\n\nC = 43890589.6736 bits per second or approximately 44 Mbps?\n\nDoes that look right?\n\nThanks :)",

It doesn't make sense to compute this every single time. \n\nThe only practical way to do this would be to store a master list for each user as metadata. This seems like a fairly significant about of storage to be used, even if some sort of optimizations are used. It would also require less, but still considerable processor cycles.\n\nThis could be completely proprietary and no one knows, but how do you think it is done? I tried googling and all I could find were articles on details of their privacy settings. \n\nThis is out of my league but my guess would be a use of the [observer pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern) when a user makes a new friend, in addition to some fancy ways to group people into networks if they are all friends with one another to save space. \n\nedit: fixed some words, added some words",

These diagrams are akin to an algorithms, there are individual actions executed and structures such as conditional switches (ifs) and loops.\n\nI'm trying to come up with an algorithm that traverses these FSM graphs and rebuilds them as an algorithm, but I'm not entirely sure if it can be done at all. For example, I can't think of a way of representing [this FSM](http://imgur.com/lPW070a) as an algorithm using only ifs and without repeating any nodes.\n\nI'm pretty certain it can't be done, but can't think of a good, logical reason.

I have been debating graduating from college a semester early (after this fall) in order to save the money for a semester's tuition. My college is only undergraduate students so I would be only applying to programs at other institutions.\n\nMy eventual goal is to become a machine learning engineer in the tech or fintech industry. While I recognize that most people pursue a PhD to do academic research, I see publishing as a fulfilling and rewarding endeavor and I also see the value in obtaining a background in research for the sake of specialization and expertise.\n\nLast summer, I was lucky to do research in bioinformatics at a top 3 research university and should hopefully obtain a publication in a machine learning conference paper this year. This summer I will be interning at one of the big 4 tech companies on an ML-focused project.\n\nThat said, while I have taken upper-level courses in computer vision, statistical modeling, probability theory, and real analysis, I lack any formal course work in machine learning. Most of what I know comes from self-studying and I feel like I lack a solid theoretical foundation in many areas of AI and ML as well as some systems courses that would be useful. If I graduate early, then I will be unable to take my school's undergraduate courses in AI, operating systems and statistical theory, as well as programming languages and computer networks (areas in which I am interested). I am worried that skipping these foundational courses will leave holes in my applications to different graduate programs.\n\nDoes anyone have any advice on this?\n\nThank you in advance!",
