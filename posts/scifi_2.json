        "text": "\nWhen we left the crew of the Titan, the ship had taken a badly self inflicted hit to the stern (or Star Drive if you prefer) section. Engines and power were in a bad way and the ship was falling down a gravity well towards something (presumably massive) at the heart of the nebula. A changeling is also loose aboard the ship committing all sorts of sabotage. Well, one sort thus far.\n\nThe A plot is made of the character’s reactions to this impending doom- and some attempts to get out of the situation. The B plot is Raffi! Nah, just kidding. Recap Raffi is taking a break for this episode and the B plot will be provided by Seven and Shaw hunting the changeling. The whole episode takes place on the Titan, bar some ‘5 years go’ stuff and a check in with Vadic.\n\nThe plot is mostly character driven with an underlying theme of the characters needing to connect. In some cases this is purely personal, and in others they must work together to get out of a situation in classic Trek style. Picard, facing death, attempts to bond with the son he never knew he had. Riker reveals why he returned to Starfleet and bemoans the separation from his imzadi- and the reason for that self-inflicted separation. Shaw reveals why he hates Picard and why he treats Seven with (at best) disdain. Seven has to work with Shaw to track down the changeling. Picard and Riker need to reconnect after the heated exchange that capped off the last episode. Crusher meanwhile is working on something. Something that may just get the crew out of this mess and let them live long enough to enjoy this affirmation.\n\nI’ve often railed on Discovery for its ‘feels first’ approach to story telling. At first blush this episode may seem to be doing the same thing, but as always the difference is in the details. In short, this episode is focused on mature emotional discussion driven by the characters and their baggage, each interaction with its own flavour as influenced by the involved parties. The goal is to bridge some interpersonal gaps and work as a team, rather than an egocentric therapy session. The backdrop of these exchanges is also important- the ship may be in crisis but it’s the sort of the crisis the crew can’t do anything about. The engines are screwed. Crushination at the heart of the nebula is all but assured. There’s no technobabble solution (yet!) all avenues of escape are cut off. There’s nothing left to do but prepare to face the end. The situation both encourages emotional intensity and allows for it- except for Seven who still has a job to do.\n\nThe episode makes use of a Voyager deep cut by having the holodeck use its own separate power grid to explain how its running while the ship is screwed, with further justification that the holodeck can offer a ‘sanctuary’ in times like this where the crew is certainly going to be under incredible stress. Human needs including relaxation and rest don’t just suddenly vanish in a crisis and the longer people go without them, the more likely they are to start making serious screw ups. In err… less thought out shows, they’d have the holodeck just work because Star Trekers have holodecks. Again, detail matters for making this world and by extension the people who live in it, feel real. It doesn’t matter how emotionally intense scenes are if disbelief is well and truly grounded. It becomes just actors on a stage- fine for theatre but not for here. \n\nPicard and Jack (the latter being initially unreceptive) connect out over a drink. Picard likes his wine. Jack prefers whiskey- cheap if you’ve got it. Again- nice detail to illustrate that they are very different people while also getting in a nod to the established lore. Picard tells Jack a story about him and Jack’s namesake. Jack asks how much longer he’s going to have hair for.  The conversation is initially appropriately awkward and is well acted by both actors. Picard drops an F bomb and I didn’t hate it. It feels appropriate, backed up by the performance Stewart is giving- Picard is remembering something so horrible he can only express himself with a curse. Trekkies will have their own thoughts on characters cursing but I reckon it was a good moment.\n\nThen Shaw turns up. Off his tits on the classic combo of pain killers (and possibly booze), he rips the moment up and proceeds to explain his dislike of (by method laying into) Picard. Shock and shock- Shaw was at the battle of Wolf 359. But this point is augmented with a personal story of survivor’s guilt to add some more dimension than simply “you killed mah friends”. Picard responds by walking away but not before reverting to the stand offish, distant character he is in TNG. Stewart brushes the dust off that depiction of the character and gives it back to us in the worst possible context- all of that effort and change Picard made to himself that’s been so well expressed through the series to date is stripped away for a few moments. Unable to deal with Shaw’s emotional barrage, Picard reverts to the only thing he knows will work- and leaves his son in the room in the process. It’s a powerful moment conveyed in the performance and writing rather than having characters raise their voices.\n\nMeanwhile Seven is hunting the changeling with limited success. At one point she finds it and even shoots it, but then stands there like a lemon while it gets away instead of raising a force field or just shooting it again (or cranking up the phaser power and shooting it again). Hey, episode isn’t perfect but when it’s getting the important things so right details like this just don’t bother me. I notice them and it would be nice if they were fixed- but we’re back to the now old analogy of dents on the bodywork as opposed to a broken axle. \n\nObviously it’s too early in the season for everyone to die. So how will our intrepid explorers get out of this one? Crusher finds out the waves of energy impacting the ship from the heart of the nebula are building in intensity and increasing in frequency. The crew put together a risky plan to throw everything they have left into using one of the intense waves to recharge the ship and ‘ride’ the wave out of the nebula. There’s a bit of false tension where Riker is unwilling to take the chance (come on dude it’s die now trying to get out or die in forty minutes), but is persuaded. Shaw makes modifications to the ship (he’s revealed to have come up through the engineering track as part of his Wolf 359 story, and the ship is old enough the current engineers can’t make the modifications needed), and the crew are able to surf out of the nebula with nary a Beasty Boys track to be heard.\n\nOn the way the Titan grabs an asteroid with its tractor beam and uses is to take the Shrike by surprise and give it a good whack. Being shielded the Shrike survives but not before being crippled to the point of being unable to pursue. It’s a very Riker move, pay off for him getting his shit together over the episode.\n\nThe crew turn back to see that whatever process was going on in the nebula has spawned a whole mess of space jellyfish in a special effect that’s charmingly reminiscent of TNG effects without being awful.  The crew briefly enjoy this new life, before deciding to boldly GTFO before the Shrike gets its senses together. \n\nEpisode 4 is a great climax to the first act of the series. It takes things built in previous episodes and runs with them, it provides a strong look at the characters under stress, and it’s confident enough in the writing and acting to let those things carry an episode without the need for lots of explosions and dogfights and phaser fire AND SHOUTING. The climax here is emotional, the characters facing death and what they do under such intense circumstances. Seven doesn’t get this, but instead she has a job to do and is denied that luxury- acting like a Star Fleet officer with a duty. The crew have now actually been brought together- they have experienced something with true emotional weight as a group and have been able to overcome differences and personal grudges to ‘be their best selves’. And they have changed as individuals over the process. Compare this to Picard season 1 (and to a point 2) where the crew of the… *checks google* La Sirena were all best mates for no real reason beyond they were the main case of the show. \n\nI tip my hat, doff my cap, tug my forelock and owe a pint to, to Terry Matlas. He’s taken a steaming turd of a series, something I quit in disgust two and half episodes into its second season, and made it into something I actively want to watch each week. Something I am not just watching to fill time, but is actively engaging me and entertaining me. There’s a little rage in the fact it’s taken over a decade since the revival of Star Trek to get something even enjoyable, let alone so good. But we’ve got it now and I couldn’t be happier. In my write up on episode 1 I was keen to stress that Nu Trek tends to start at its best each season and get worse and worse as the season goes along. Well by now every other season had already started to fall apart. Picard S3 is still going strong and the seismic shift in approach and quality leaves me believing that the rest of the season will also be solid. I’m abandoning the caution and going full optimist.\n\nStar Trek that makes me feel optimistic? Whodathunkit?",

It makes the classic mistake of telling about instead of showing what’s happening. \n\nI don’t know if this book is just a lot worse than the first one, or if my tastes have changed but i’m not sure i’m going to finish it. There’s not a single character that i care about enough to want to know what happens to them, and the events are described in such general terms that there’s nothing compelling about them. \n\nThis guy seriously needs an editor. This book could have been half as long and twice as compelling if someone were to just cut out all the boring and unnecessary repetition.

There’s something almost supernatural happening with the gravity well that actually has a kind of cool payoff. Our heroes use their brains for a change while showing heart and grit. \n\nI liked it.

I know that we write stories to examine ourselves, and writers often use these robot characters as stand-ins/metaphors/allegories for oppressed people, or the use these characters to examine human nature. \n\nI also know that plenty of stories exist where the robot's are not sentient, or where their sentience is not important to the plot in any meaningful way (e.i. basic scifi drones or most star wars droids). \n\nI guess I'm asking for stories where a robot or similar \"artificial\" character is presented as sentient, but this turns out to be a lie or deception.\n\nDoes this exist?",

There's a scientific research station on this planet, where scientists study the wildlife of Horeska, looking to understand how they survive and thrive in such a heavily irradiated environment. The researchers are hoping to use this research to develop treatments and cures for radiation sickness.\n\nWhen the PCs arrive in system, they're going to receive a distress call from the station. Some disaster has occurred, and the researchers are trapped in the facility. They need help getting rescued, and then they're going to need assistance getting the facility back online.\n\nEssentially, I'm going to turn this into a game of Among Us. There's gonna be ten or so researchers there, plus the four PCs, and one (maaaybe two) of the researchers is actually a saboteur. They want to shut down the facility, and they're willing to resort to murder to do so, but they want to do this covertly so that nobody either on- or off-world suspects them or their backers.\n\nHere's the thing: I'm not sure what their actual motivation should be! I'm not sure exactly why they want to shut the facility down, and, if they *do* want to, why does it need to be covert? Why not just plant a bomb or go in guns blazing?\n\nI've got one idea I'm toying with, which I'll put in the comments, but if anything else comes to mind for anyone, I would love to get some brainstorming feedback!

        "text": "^by ^Dr. ^David ^Dodson, ^Ph.D\n\n^^^Published ^^^on ^^^Monday, ^^^March ^^^10th, ^^^2025 \n\nWhen our physics research team at Oak Ridge National Laboratory discovered alternate realities more than two years ago, many other types of sciences suddenly became relevant, including chronolineology (the study of branching timelines), multiverse and timeline cartography, variant psychology, and variant genealogy. Today we will be going into brief details about the latter. \n\nFor starters, let’s look at what is known as the “Variant Family Tree Law.”\n\n**The Variant Family Tree Law Explained**\n\nSuppose you become lucky (or unlucky?) enough to enter an alternate universe not unlike our own. And suppose you get the chance to meet your alternate self in that world. If this person happened to be born at the exact same date and time as you, and is genetically a carbon copy of you, they are biologically equivalent to being your identical twin. If the variant was born on the same day and at the same (or a similar) time, but is genetically different at any level, they are essentially a fraternal twin. If the alternate in question has a different age (and different looks, or is a member of the opposite sex, etc), they are a genetic older or younger sibling. \n\n(**Note:** First and middle names can be the same as, or different than, your own. This has no bearing on how close your alternate self is to you— or whether or not they even *are* a version of you at all— but is merely a consequence of a parent’s naming choice.)\n\nSpeaking of parents, if one is genetically identical to yours, while another is different in any way, your variant is biologically your half-sibling. If both parents are genetically different than the ones in your home universe, this other world’s version of you is a “first cousin” of yours. If one or more grandparent is different, your alternate is a more distant cousin, and so on, and so forth. \n\n**An Oft-Cited Example**\n\nResearchers of this field have often cited Marvel and Sony’s popular 2021 film *Spider-Man: No Way Home* as an example to further explain this theory— given that each of the three Peter Parkers’ sets of parents were likely different, the closest possible relationship between “Peter One,” “Peter Two,” and “Peter Three” would be as genetic first cousins (despite Andrew Garfield’s variant referring to the others as “brothers” at one point… heh). \n\n**Conclusion**\n\nScience can be convoluted, and any field of multiverse science can be *very* convoluted, especially when dealing with infinite possibilities! Variant genealogy is no different, but I hope this article has helped you understand this exciting new *branch* of science (pun intended). \n\nSo on the off-chance you ever meet an alternate “self,” now you know you’re actually meeting a long-lost relative from another universe! \n\n^About \n\n^Dr. ^David ^Dodson, ^Ph.D ^is ^a ^physicist ^based ^in ^Oak ^Ridge, ^Tennessee. ^A ^Harvard ^graduate ^and ^colleague ^of ^Leah ^Broussard, ^he ^was ^one ^of ^the ^first ^persons ^to ^discover ^the ^existence ^of ^parallel ^and ^divergent ^universes ^in ^August ^2022. ^Now, ^he ^is ^a ^leading ^researcher ^in ^the ^brand ^new ^field ^of ^variant ^genealogy.",

        "text": "My wife and I are rewatching Fringe and I think it needs a fresh spotlight in today's conversation about classic SciFi shows.\n\nThe show is brilliant. Not one episode or season to me strikes me as \"filler\" where the writers didn't know where to go with it but had airtime to fill and just made up bullshit. \n\nEvery episode and season was made with purpose and. I'd believe it if you told me the creators knew from the very beginning the entire story and had it all planned out from day one. \n\nThe science is believable. The emotional consequences of everything that happens in the show is VERY present and it gets EVEN BETTER once we start dealing with &gt;!the alternate versions of characters in the other universe!&lt; \n\nIf I had to pick ONE episode I don't like as much it's prolly the first episode just because Broyles is an asshole to Olivia and Peter is a bit of a doucher. But all of that melts away by episode two. The character interactions start to run deeper, back stories are given and you suddenly understand everyone more. \n\nI also love the running gags that surround\nWalter. Like him never getting Astrid's name right, he's always experimenting with drugs and asking for inane food items at inappropriate times. \n\nIf someone here hasn't seen it yet (HBO MAX has the whole series), I can't recommend it enough. It's episodic but has major plots that over arch the entire series. \n\nI also love the Easter eggs. The weird symbols between scenes at commercial breaks belong to a secret alphabet that spell the episodes title. There is an &gt;!Observer!&lt; In every episode. So on ... \n\nIt honestly deserves a place in the pantheon of all time best modern SciFi shows alongside X Files, Stargate, Battlestar and Firefly.",
