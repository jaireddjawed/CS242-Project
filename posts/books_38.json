        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/117gj59/a_disappointed_review_of_the_emperors_soul_by/",
        "text": "I made the mistake of reading *The Emperor’s Soul* shortly after reading *Frankenstein*. In some ways, they are surprisingly similar tales: both involve the artificial creation of what is effectively a new conscious being. Yet while *Frankenstein* unflinchingly explores the dubious morality of such an undertaking, *The Emperor’s Soul* largely ignores the issue.\n\nIn *The Emperor’s Soul*, a character named Shai must essentially create an artificial mind for a brain-dead emperor. She is instructed to make this artificial mind as close as possible to the man’s original mind, before the accident that left him brain-dead. At first, she complies, but gradually comes to realize that she can “improve” him by giving him a little extra moral fiber. She comes to view this as creating her life’s masterwork—an incomparable artistic achievement that will be her legacy. The book makes this its main theme—the connection between art and obsession, the drive to excel, and what have you. On the surface, this may seem all well and good, but when read in light of Frankenstein, it all becomes rather disturbing.\n\nWhat gives anyone the right to create a new life-form? Shai is effectively playing God—under coercion at first, but over time, as she begins to view the project as an expression of her artistic skill, she leans into the part and takes it farther than anyone intended. She decides to make the titular emperor a better person, but who is she to say what’s better? She is accountable to no-one and nothing but herself. Even if she’s justified in trying to make him better than the original, the question remains whether she’s justified in creating a new mind at all. How would this new person, inhabiting the body of a similar but not mentally-identical person, react if he knew he was the creation of a human? What if there’s some unintended consequence, and he turns out to be a worse person than the original? Isn’t it also highly questionable to undertake such a morally-fraught endeavor entirely in secret, to preserve the illusion that the new emperor is the same as the old one? (The secrecy is mostly not Shai’s fault, but the narrative doesn’t dwell on the enormity of such a deception.) In light of all this, isn’t it incredibly prideful to view this project as a form of artistic expression, with little concern for the deeper metaphysical implications? Isn’t it, in fact, strikingly reminiscent of Dr. Frankenstein’s attitude at the beginning of his tale?\n\nThese are all important questions that are not nitpicks or minor incidental details. They are implicit in the very premise of the story, and to gloss over them is to share in the blind hubris of Dr. Frankenstein—the hubris that’s lead our species to seriously endanger itself countless times, especially in the past couple of centuries, by valuing technical achievement over morality. “Just because you can doesn’t mean you should,” as another similarly-themed story can tell you. If you’re going to play God, you’d damned well better think long and carefully about it first. Sanderson’s chosen theme of exploring the nature of artistry is a fine one, but he should have chosen a less-fraught premise to explore it with unless he was prepared to simultaneously explore at least some of the questions Mary Shelley raised two hundred years ago.\n\nOn a different but interesting (to me) note, there's something else that bothered me a bit about the novella: it’s sci-fi barely disguised as fantasy. Shai is essentially creating an AI. The magic system resembles computer programming in the way the final “product” must be built up to with a complex series of interrelated directives and failsafes. This is reinforced in the dialogue—there’s talk, for instance, of building “back doors into the emperor’s soul” and magical effects “not taking.” To many, this is a beloved feature of Sanderson’s writing, and I don’t mean to say it’s necessarily bad. But it doesn’t give me what I’m looking for from fantasy. Science fiction, tending more towards empiricism than fantasy, is more suited technical conversations about “mechanical” procedures.\n\nAs a final complaint, Sanderson is of course no master prose-stylist, but couldn’t he come up with better systems of nomenclature? Does he need silly apostrophes in his names? Do terms like “MaiPon and “reForging” need capital letters in the middle that forcibly call to mind brand names like FedEx and PlayStation? Of all the awkward PG-rated swear words he’s come up with, couldn’t he do any better than “Nights?” (Nights, that’s a limp swear-word.) I also dislike the way he tosses in little worldbuilding details that don’t matter and aren’t embedded in any kind of meaningful context—for example, early on he tells us that the stonework in a certain location was “after the Lamio style, with tall pillars of marble inlaid with reliefs.” This doesn’t really tell us enough specific about the Lamio style to let us envision it as anything other than generic columns with some kind of undefined reliefs. And styles of architecture have nothing to do with the plot, nor any of the character’s interests, nor even with the story’s symbolism, so why do we need to hear a made-up name for a thing we have no reason to care about? It’s supposed to add “immersion,” but it does so in a shallow way bereft of genuine meaning or interest.\n\nTo conclude, The Emperor’s Soul is not a bad story. It paints a reasonably compelling picture of a human soul, and its commentary on the artistic process is not without merit. However, I don’t think these elements are strong enough to outweigh Sanderson’s usual stylistic shortcomings and his myopic oversight of the philosophical implications of his story unless you’re already a fan.",

I know Eco has a penchant for philosophical fiction, which I really enjoy when it's done with humility. I also love twisting and encyclopaedic novels: the Dictionary of Khazar is amazing, the Books of Jacob fights with House of Leaves for my favourite novel ever, which are mammoth in different ways.\n\nAdmittedly, &gt;!I haven't yet witnessed the identification of the Intruder!&lt;\\- I'm just about 100 pages in. There were ideas that I liked to immerse myself in: being marooned twice, first in the ocean, then in the sunlight that surrounds the ship; exploring the ghost and what part Roberto plays in its creation; and at times his writing is beautiful. However. It seems to me that he has no soul. He has become lost in ideas that seem interesting, and forgotten to make them mean something. I am aware that I am not far into the novel and what things mean becomes incredibly clear when you begin to take on the way of the novel, but Roberto's memories are described so dispassionately I wonder what the purpose of the foray into memory is at all. Nothing has yet begun to link together, and in everything else I recently read I begin to see things immediately. And yet I know that I'm missing something here, as you can find meaning in anything if you understand it well enough. I got so frustrated with Eco's writing yesterday I had to put it down, with how scathingly he writes the priest that confesses Roberto and with the clear veneration that he creates the Parisian that Roberto looks up to: what is the point in putting philosophy in a book if their character doesn't reflect their ideals?\n\nI don't like the idea that I can see Umberto Eco the man writing this: infatuated with his ideas, convinced of their correctness, perhaps even arrogant having no sense of humility: and without humility, you write like this, where every monologue has the weight of a feather.\n\nTo re-emphasize, I know I'm missing something about this. But I have *never* felt this way for a book before, and it's got me in turmoil. Eco enjoyers- what am I missing?",

If I wasn't doing it every five seconds, it'd feel like I'm reading the book, but the information is not connecting, therefore I forget everything right afterwards. It's like this especially with feelings (when I'm reading a novel) - I *constantly* need to realize what the character is feeling at that moment, so I pause and try to connect everything together to feel what they're going through...\n\nThis keeps happening and I'm getting sick of it, because one book can take me weeks to finish, when I'm capable of finishing it in a few days. I'm wasting a lot of my time and I honestly don't even understand why this is happening to me.

I watched the first couple seasons of iCarly when it was on and it's crazy to me that I, like everyone else watching, had no idea what this poor girl had been going through. I feel absolutely sickened by her mom. What a disgusting, narcissistic, abusive person she was. I'm also sickened by Dan Schneider, and this is actually a very eye-opening book about child actors in Hollywood and the harmful nature of growing up in the entertainment industry. Also such an eye-opening book about eating disorders, especially bulimia. I feel such sorrow for Jennette and I hope her road to true recovery has been going well. If it's any consolation to her, she was a funny and talented actress on that show, and now I know, she is an even better writer. I'd pick up the next thing she writes.\n\nThe one part of the memoir, of her meeting her biological dad, felt a bit rushed, in my opinion. I would've liked a little more about that.  But other than that, great book.",

I had to power through a few storylines and arcs we totally could have done without. But please, if you enjoyed the first few books and then gave up, try again - the last 3+ will blow you away. A Memory of Light is a masterpiece from start to finish. I am absolutely floored right now. \n\nEgwene is the best character in the series, and I currently cannot think of a better female character arc in any book I've read. Maybe that's just because I'm all worked up right now though, but I don't think so! One of my all time favorite characters - just the best. \n\nI am going to miss these characters so much. It's been a long ride (over a year!) that I feel bittersweet to have finished. \n\nJust had to spew this! Thanks for reading.",

        "text": "Honestly, this should be a legal requirement (yes, that's tongue in cheek) for multi book series. Out of all the series I've read, and there's been many, only once have I read a book (literally one book, not even the whole series) where the book started with a recap chapter to get you up to speed, which you could easily skip over since you're binge reading back to back anyway and carry on to the actual book. However, if it had been a while since you read the last book, you could easily just read the recap. Perfect solution. \n\nUnfortunately, it seems the preferred style for most authors is to weave bits of recap into the first several chapters leaving for a very annoying mix of reading interesting new content constantly interrupted by telling me things I already know from the previous book(s), totally breaking immersion. Some authors do this quote subtly, just passing hints almost to refresh your memory, which is ok, but most make it read like snippets of a history textbook inserted into the narrative.\n\nI should say I had one other book where the recap was separated from the narrative but just as the first part of chapter 1 so it meant reading a few sentences to see if it was recap or new story, skip a page, rinse and repeat until finding the actual start. Just label it.\n\nSo, this would be my ranking of recap styles:\n\n1) Separate, clearly labeled recap section. Actual story contains no recap material at all.\n2) No recap content at all. Briefly wondering who some minor character is breaks immersion far less than dropping the character's social media bio in the middle of the sentence they are first mentioned again.\n3) Weave recap material into the first several chapters. This is awful, stop doing it. For the 1% of authors actually doing this smoothly, keep at it if you must, but for everyone else, see number 1.",

Is it ever going to be mentioned again? Are we going to get an explanation of what any of this is or even means? Banks seems to be going for world building by throwing so much extraneous and shallow detail at us that we just assume there must be a larger universe with a rich history. It's an absolute slog to get through because its neither entertaining or meaningful. It absolutely packed page to page with fluffy nonsense that does nothing to inspire the imagination nor set the context of the world in which the story plays out. \n\nDespite all this even the core ideas like the Mercatoria are poorly characterised. It seeming to be cumbersome, flawed, strict but ultimately benevolent form of government at the start only to be completely turned on its head with no warning in the space of a page.\n\nPerhaps I could forgive all this if something had actually HAPPENED.

The story has all the flavor of pulp fiction from that era, a cross between \"Fu Manchu\" and \"Secret Agent X\".  The plot  involves an African-American millionaire who plots to create a Black  empire across Africa and overthrow white supremacy throughout the world.   The plot seemed surprising for that era, seemed like something that  would have been published in the 1960s.

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1177web/thoughts_on_the_riddlemaster_of_hed/",
        "text": "*The Riddle-Master of Hed* is a tricky book to review on its own, because I don’t think I know what happened in it. Not really. I could give you a plot summary, but then you would only know as much as I do, and that isn’t much—the book is wonderfully opaque and seems to delight in not letting you know the full context of anything. It’s also hard to review because it’s clearly the first act of a longer story: it would be absurd to review *The Lord of the Rings* if you’d only read up to the part where Frodo reaches Rivendell, and doubly-absurd if it were written in such a way that you still weren't quite sure what the Ring had to do with that Sauron fellow. So I’m not going to give a proper review, but just a few scattered thoughts and observations I had while reading. I hope to write a proper review of the series once I’ve read all of it, but I’m not sure how long that’ll take me.\n\nThe book hails from the period of roughly the mid-1960s to 1977 when fantasy authors could draw inspiration from Tolkien without feeling the need (or being coerced by publishers) to fit themselves into a narrowly-defined “Tolkienesque” mold that mimics certain elements of his work without engaging with his deeper themes and narrative techniques. The world of Hed features no elves, dwarves, or Hobbits, the closest thing to a Gandalf-figure is a harpist—not a wizard—and the narrative is clearly centered around one protagonist who never really accrues a fellowship around him—he outright refuses at least one offer of companionship. (Also, the map has the ocean to the east—a truly revolutionary move on McKillip’s part.) But despite the lack of surface similarities, McKillip showed that she understood the narrative function of The Shire far better than any number of would-be Tolkiens. The island kingdom of Hed is presented as a comfortable rustic quasi-paradise much like the Shire—a paradise Morgon, its humble monarch, is understandably very attached to and feels responsible towards. As a result, when destiny comes calling and he inevitably Refuses the Call, it never feels as if he’s a coward or a slacker, because we understand that he has a strong legitimate attachment that his destiny is getting in the way of. This is, of course, very similar to Frodo’s reluctance to leave the Shire in *The Lord of the Rings*, and it’s effective for much the same reasons. The story is also told from a slightly removed perspective that doesn’t give us as much access to its characters’ inner lives as a typical novel is expected to—another technique of Tolkien’s (and Le Guin’s, and many others) that is sadly under-utilized in the broader fantasy genre. It contributes to the genre's inherent sense of wonder by making me feel as if I’m reading about characters out of a fairy-tale or myth, not a bunch of knuckle-heads who have the same shortcomings I do.\n\nI also appreciate McKillip’s use of Welsh names. I’m not sure if anything in the story was inspired by Welsh mythology (I’ve read the Mabinogion but haven’t noticed any parallels), but Welsh is great for fantasy names, as Lloyd Alexander and Susan Cooper could tell you. And, of course, Tolkien based Sindarin on Welsh.\n\n*Hed* features a narrative technique that the *Malazan* series is often praised for: throwing the reader into its world with an absolute minimum of exposition. The book is written almost as if it’s an in-universe chronicle; it doesn’t bother explaining things that everyone in the world of Hed would be expected to know, or things that its characters feel are their own private business. As a result, there are a number of vital pieces of information that we’re left to extrapolate for ourselves from things the characters say. If you’re paying attention, it’s not hard to figure out what you’re meant to, but failing to do so will make the book’s ending incomprehensible (as evidenced by several frustrated Goodreads reviews). The biggest difference between this book’s (series’) technique and Malazan’s is that it stays focused on one character, rather than constantly changing perspectives between a huge cast of briefly-sketched characters. I think structuring the story as McKillip does is a really good way to maintain a sense of mystery and avoid talking down to her readers while still keeping it relatively accessible to an audience that may not want to tear their hair out making spreadsheets to keep track of the massive complexity of it all.\n\nAnother “modern” feature of the book is the fact that its protagonist is aware that he has a destiny and actively tries to resist it. Other Chosen Ones may feel they’re unready or the wrong person for the job, but Morgon of Hed tries to reject his destiny specifically because he doesn’t want a destiny. I can’t think of an earlier fantasy work in which the hero takes that attitude towards fate.\n\nApart from the lack of exposition, McKillip made another change to her usual style to accommodate the three-volume-epic format: her prose is a bit more straightforward than usual. It’s still far from being utilitarian—it has excellent rhythm and use of metaphor—but it isn’t a borderline prose-poem as many of her other books are. This disappointed me slightly at first, but I came to like it. I suspect it was an intentional choice to blend her own prose style with Tolkien’s, and viewed from that angle, I think it works marvelously, especially since the dream-like quality of her stories shines through as clearly as ever. Tolkien could make me believe in talking trees, but only McKillip could make me feel as if I was becoming a tree.\n\nAll in all, it was a wonderful read, made all the more so by the fact that I was frequently bewildered. I’m not totally sure how I feel about it yet, because I have little idea where the story is going, but I’m very curious to find out.",

My first thought was how Meursault like Ari appeared in parts of the book. It was almost like Melbourne was Algeria and the killing of the Arab was Ari’s crescendoing destructive behaviour, his sexual encounters, his carelessness about the future all until that scene in the room with George. I keep thinking that’s the point the veil of detachment lifted but frankly it might be quite obvious that it was never really there. Loaded was a deeply tender and heartbreaking read and although the ending did leave a bitter taste for me, I’m glad I stumbled upon it.",

I kinda wish the movie was based on a book so I could read it too. \n\nAre there any books with a similar premise to Fresh? I'm looking for something with a gripping, intense, and disturbing storyline similar to what I watched. Any recommendations would be much appreciated!",

        "text": "First of all this is just my opinion in the book of girl in pieces by Kathleen Glasgow \nI would give this book a 4.5 but Definitely leaning more towards the 5 stars mark ,\nThe one negative thing I witnessed is that there is so many characters and you don't get much contexts about them so you forget them but they also tend to be very important to the plot in the rest of the book so you kinda have to stop and try to remember who they were but overall This book is one of the most beautiful books I have ever read .\n***I do not recommend anyone with any mental health problems to read this book because it's very triggering .\nFirst of all I loved the small chapters and the way that they were written it made me feel like we are reading her diaries which made me feel more attached to the book \nAnd also loved that the author didn't explain everything in pure detail so it made me feel like i'm on the same boat as Charlie (the heroine) I had to figure stuff out leave some puzzles incomplete and actually think about the book not just read it \nAlso I feel like kathleen did a very good job of presenting what it is to be stuck and to not know where to go and feel like everyone around seems to be figuring it out except for you which was so relatable to me .\nAnd finally I loved the author note I felt like it made the book complete .\nI can understand why alot of people dnf this book or give it bad reviews because it's not a book that you just read and give you entertainment for a couple of days it's a book with very heavy topics that change the way you think and leave you  wondering after .",
