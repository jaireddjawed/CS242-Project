Many have something from their childhood that they hold dear, and now is the time to share it with the world!\n\nAs an artist, I am currently working on a social exhibit designed to archive the childhoods of former children from all over the world. I am seeking participants who are willing to share a photo of a childhood item along with a questionnaire consisting of 15 questions regarding self/childhood. All entries will remain anonymous.\n\nParticipating in this exhibit is a chance for you to share a piece of your childhood with the world, and to be a part of a global archive that will preserve the memories of generations to come. Your contribution will be invaluable, as it will help us gain a deeper understanding of what it means to be a child, and how our childhood experiences shape who we are as adults.\n\nIf you are interested in participating, please feel free to reach out to me directly or submit via my [website](https://berkannawicks.com/remnants/questionnaire)!  Your involvement is greatly appreciated and will help us create a meaningful exhibit that celebrates the joys and challenges of childhood.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration!!",
