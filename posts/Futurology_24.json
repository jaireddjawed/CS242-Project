And that crash landing killed the dinosaurs and out of were the ones who remained alive\n\nMaybe they stored all their research in a book and now that book is known as the Bible or Bhagwad Gita? What if all those great scholars tell the tales of the Martians and those Martians taught them, What if we all are the descendants of some people from outerspace who came to earth to start from scratch after their original home was destroyed.\n\nWhat if Mount Olympus, and many other locations that we have only heard or read about actually existed? What if Zeus or Other gods were just Martians who were so advanced in their technology?\n\n\nIndian book Ramayana mentions Ravana having a vehicle called Pushpak Vimaan which could fly, a Vehicle that could do what we are striving to do now in those ancient times.\n\n\nI know this sounds fascinating but it leads to the question if not Mars, which planet could be our Third home?",

        "text": "I‚Äôm trying to create a sci-fi story set in the far future where parents use genetic engineering on their kids to not only influence what behavior, gender, and looks they will have. But to also make them smarter, stronger and longer lived. Here is my take on how these future super-humans could be made realistically by influencing certain genes and inducing notable mutations that are already present in some people around the world.\n\nPersonality \n1: (Greater Empathy) these future would probably be able to strike a balance between the average person in and an empath, making them more empathetic and intuitive without as much risk of them accidentally ‚Äúabsorbing‚Äù other peoples emotions, or becoming as easily overstimulated/emotionally exhausted.\n2:  An increase in the hormone Oxytocin causes these future humans to be more optimistic.\n\nIntelligence \n1: Eidetic memory.\n2: They carry the CORD7 mutation of the RIMS1 gene, which has proven to be correlated to increased verbal IQ and memory as it increases the transmission of information at the synapses, and thus also increases cognitive function.\n\nStrength\n1: ‚ÄúUnbreakable Bones‚Äù or TDO, a mutation that causes bones to be extremely dense.\n2: (Myostatin-Related Muscle Hypertrophy) a mutation that causes muscle cells to grow bigger and divide more than usual.\n3: The genes ACTN3 and ACE are much more prevalent in their bodies. These are the genes that influence muscle fibers, specifically fast-twitch muscle fibers. Making theses genes stronger could result in better strength, speed and endurance.\n\nSenses\n1: (Tetrachromacy) a condition that causes the eyes to have a 4th cone in them allowing for visualization of a wider range of color.\n2: (Synesthesia) a condition that causes certain stimuli to trigger more than one sense, like being able to taste the color blue. Along with allowing people to experience the world in more exciting ways, people with synesthesia have been shown to be smarter, more creative, and to have a better memory.\n\nOrgans\n1: Larger lungs and lower residual capacity to improve respiration.\n2: Larger heart size for better blood flow.\n3: Increased levels of the gene HEXIM1 would increase the number and density of blood vessels in the heart and could potentially even prevent cancer. \n4: A naturally large barrel shaped chest to hold the now bigger lungs and heart.\n5: An extra artery is present in their arms.\n6: Arteries are generally larger in diameter.\n\nOther(no one category)\n1: No more wisdom teeth.\n2: (Super Sleepers) by having a mutation in the genes DEC2 and ADRB1, these future humans only need 4 hours of sleep a night.\n3: Higher metabolism.\n\nThese are just the ideas I have right now.  Please share what you think and what ideas you have.",

        "text": "\nYour gut has¬†an obvious job: It processes the food you eat. But it has another important function: It protects you from the bacteria, viruses, or allergens you ingest along with that food. ‚ÄúThe largest part of the immune system in humans is the GI tract, and our biggest exposure to the world is what we put in our mouth,‚Äù says Michael Helmrath, a pediatric surgeon at Cincinnati Children‚Äôs Hospital Medical Center who treats patients with intestinal diseases.¬†\n\nSometimes this system malfunctions or doesn‚Äôt develop properly, which can lead to gastrointestinal conditions like ulcerative colitis, Crohn‚Äôs disease, and celiac‚Äîall of which are on the rise worldwide. Studying these conditions in animals can only tell us so much, since their diets and immune systems are very different from ours.\n\nIn search of a better method, last week Helmrath and his colleagues announced in the¬†journal¬†Nature Biotechnology¬†that they had transplanted tiny, three-dimensional balls of human intestinal tissue into mice. After several weeks, these spheres‚Äîknown as¬† organoids‚Äîdeveloped key features of the human immune system. The model could be used to mimic the human intestinal system without having to experiment on sick patients.\n\nThe experiment is a dramatic follow-up from 2010, when researchers at Cincinnati Children‚Äôs became the first in the world to create a working intestine organoid‚Äîbut their¬†initial model was¬†a simpler version in a lab dish. A few years later, Helmrath says, they realized ‚Äúwe needed it to become more like human tissue.‚Äù¬†\n\nScientists elsewhere are growing similar miniature replicas of other human organs‚Äîincluding the brain, lung, and liver‚Äîto better understand how they develop normally and how things go awry to give rise to disease. Organoids are also being used as¬†human avatars for drug testing. Since they contain human cells and display some of the same structures and functions as real organs, some researchers think they‚Äôre a¬†better stand-in than lab animals.\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs incredibly important that when we are trying to create these platforms for testing drug efficacy and drug side effects in human tissue models that we actually make sure that we are as close to, and as complete as, the tissue in which the drug will work eventually in our human body. So, adding the immune system is an important part of that,‚Äù says Pradipta Ghosh, director of the Humanoid Center of Research Excellence at the University of California San Diego School, which is developing human organoids to screen and test drugs. Ghosh was not involved in the study.\n\nTo grow the organoid, the scientists started with induced pluripotent stem cells, which are created from mature human cells drawn from blood or skin. These have the ability to turn into any type of body tissue. By feeding the stem cells a specific molecular cocktail, the team coaxed them into intestinal cells. After growing for 28 days in a dish, the cells formed spheres of tissue just a few millimeters in diameter.¬†\n\nThe team carefully transplanted these spheres into mice that had been genetically engineered to suppress their own immune systems so that the organoid tissue would not be rejected. (The researchers transplanted the intestinal organoid next to each mouse‚Äôs kidneys, so it wasn‚Äôt actually connected to the animals‚Äô digestive tracts.) To stimulate the organoids into producing human immune cells, they had previously given the mice human cord blood‚Äîa source of stem cells that could transform into the desired cells.¬†",

        "text": "**TL;DR: (and it's long)**\n\n**What I am trying to argue here is that ‚Äúintelligence‚Äù is complex enough to be inseparable from the physical processes that give rise to it, and if that is not convincing, the ‚Äúcomputing‚Äù power necessary to mimic it is unobtainable with any of the machinery we have created to date and nothing is on the horizon. Anything from the future that would match up could not even be called a computer at that point because the inner workings would have to be radically different. Also some criticisms of Large Language Models and neural networks in general. They don't work the way people seem to think.** \n\nI make this post not because I‚Äôm trying to get into a ‚Äúdebate‚Äù where I try to beat everyone's opinion down or to be a doom n' gloom downer, but because I'm hoping for a discussion to work through my thoughts and maybe yours. I have been mulling over some problems with the field of Artificial Intelligence and in the process I have found myself convinced that it‚Äôs never going to happen.\n\nSo I present some questions and ideas to people who still believe the hype and those who may not be into the current hype but still believe it will happen eventually. I want to refine my thinking and see if there are holes in my reasoning because of anything I have missed. I‚Äôm perfectly willing to change my mind, I just need a convincing argument and some good evidence.\n\nSo with that out of the way we‚Äôll start with this:\n\nNobody would ever say that a simulated star gives us a nuclear fusion reactor, yet we assume a simulated or emulated brain will give us a mind? Why? I know many of you are itching to trot out ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt flap wings to make planes fly! Do submarines SWIM?‚Äù but there is a massive flaw in this reasoning. We‚Äôve worked out the principles that govern flight and underwater traversal, so we can create alternative methods towards these ends. We have NOT worked out the fundamental principles necessary to create intelligence/cognition/perception by any other means, all we're working with is what it feels like to think, which is very subjective. Neural networks are also not a simulation of neurons in any sense, neither replicating any of their ‚Äúbase‚Äù functionality in an abstract form nor trying to accurately model their attributes.\n\nThe limits of the current paradigm, and any future one, come from what I think is a fundamental misunderstanding of \"the symbol grounding problem\", or rather, what has to be dealt with in order to overcome the grounding problem. Without solving this, they will not have any generalized reasoning ability or common sense. Language models give us the illusion that we can solve this with words, and I think I can articulate why this is not the case. Word association is not enough.\n\nHow are our minds ‚Äúgrounded?‚Äù How do you define the meaning of the words we use, how do you define what anything actually IS. Words and definitions of words are meaningless symbols without us to interpret them. Definitions of words can be created endlessly, because the words within those definitions also need to be defined. You are stuck in an unending recursive loop, as there is no base case, only more arbitrary symbols. You can scale to infinite parameters for these ‚Äúneural‚Äù networks and it will not matter. Imagine trying to make sense of a word cloud written in a foreign language that does not use your alphabet. The base case, the MEANING comes from visceral experience. So what are the fundamental things that make up an experience of reality, making a common sense understanding of things like cause and effect possible?\n\nMuch like a star, our brains are a real, physical object undergoing complicated processes. In a star, the fusion of atoms results in a massive release of heat and energy, and that release is what we want to capture in a reactor. In the cells of our brains, immensely complex biochemistry is carried out by the interactions of a vast number of molecular machines. Matter is being moved about and broken down for energy to carry out the construction of new materials and other processes.\n\nWe have grounding because in order to experience reality, we are both transformed by it and transformers of it. All of the activity carried out by a cell is the result of the laws of physics and chemistry playing out, natural selection iteratively refining the form and function of the molecules that prove useful in their environment for metabolism and self-replication.\n\nYour brain isn‚Äôt taking in data to be used by algorithms, neurons are NOT passive logic circuit elements! Action potentials are not like clock cycles in computers, shunting voltage about along rigid paths of logic gated circuitry; their purpose is to activate a variety of other intracellular processes.\n\nThe cells of your brain and body are being literally transformed by their own contents and interactions with their environment, shaping and reshaping every moment of their activity. Photons of light hit the cells in your eye, triggering a sequential activation of the tiny finite state machines known as signal transduction proteins. The internal state of the cell transforms and neurotransmitter gets released, once again triggering sequential activation of signaling proteins in other cells downstream in the process. This is real chemical and mechanical transformation, a complex exchange of matter and energy between you and your environment. You understand cause and effect because every aspect of your being down to the molecule depends on and is molded by it. An experience is defined by the sum total of all of this activity happening not just in the cells of your brain but everywhere in your entire body. Perception and cognition are probably inseparable for this reason.\n\nThere is no need for models of anything in the brain. Nothing has to be abstracted out and processed by algorithms to produce a desired result. The physical activity and shifting state ARE the result, no further interpretation necessary.\n\nNow let us examine what is actually happening in a deep learning system. The activity of neural networks is arbitrary-symbol manipulation. WE hand craft the constraints to retrieve desired results. Don‚Äôt let the fancy words and mathy-math of the blackbox impress you (or convince you to speculate that something deeper is happening), focus on examining the inputs and the outputs.\n\nThe fundamental flaw of a Large Language Model remains the same as the flaw of the expert systems. This flaw is again, the grounding problem, how it is that words get their meanings. The training dataset is the exact same thing as the prior art of hand coded logic rules and examples. Human beings are ranking the outputs of the chatbot for the value system the reinforcement mechanism will use to pick the most viable answer given a prompt. The black box is just averaging all of this together to be able match a statistically relevant output to the input. There is no reasoning going on here, these systems don't even handle simple negation well. It just appears like reasoning in an LLM because the structure of the words looks good to us, from the use of the vast corpus of text to find frequencies that words appear together. \n\nAsk any linguist or psychologist, humans do not learn language like this, humans do not make and use language like this. I must emphasize that we are NOT just doing next word prediction in our heads. Kids won't pick up up language from passive exposure, even with tv.\n\nYou cannot attempt to use extra data sources like images to overcome this problem with labeled associations either. Which pixel values are the ones that represent the thing you are trying to associate, and why? Human beings are going into these data sets and labeling the images. Human beings are going in and setting the constraints of the games(possible state space, how to transition between states, formalization of the problem). Human interpretation is hiding somewhere in all of these deep learning systems, we have not actually devised any methods that work without us. \n\nWhile the individual human beings labeling the data attempt to define what red is for the machine, with words and pixel values, merely even thinking about ‚Äúred‚Äù is literally altering the chemistry all across their brain in order to re-experience incidents where they encountered that wavelength of electromagnetic radiation and what transpired after.\n\nThis is why there cannot be grounding and common sense in these systems; the NN cant ever ‚Äújust know‚Äù like life can because it cannot directly experience reality without it being interpreted first by us. It‚Äôs a big bunch of matrix math that only has a statistical model of tokens of text and pixel values by averaging *symbols of our experience* *of reality*. Even the output only has meaning because the output is meaningful to us. They do absolutely NOTHING on their own. How can they perform dynamic tasks in unstructured environments without us to painstakingly define and structure everything first?\n\nChange the labels? You change the whole outcome.\n\nYou cant change the laws of physics.\n\nWe exist in the moments when molecules bump into each other. You can‚Äôt simulate that you have to DO it. Because the variance in how these bumps occur produces all of our differences and fallibility and flexibility.\n\nThe molecular dynamics are not only still too unknown to distill into an algorithm, but too complex to even simulate in real time. There isn‚Äôt enough computing power on the planet to simulate all of the the action in a single cell let alone the trillions that we are made of, in a human time frame with reliable accuracy.\n\nBonus: Moravec‚Äôs paradox is still kicking our ass. Single celled organisms (eukaryotic specifically) and the individual cells in our immune system navigate unstructured environments and complete specific and complex tasks in a manner that puts all of our robots to shame. Remember cells as tiny molecular robots composed of the assemblage of an incredible amount of complex, nested finite state machines, and then watch the Kurzgesagt videos about the immune system. The ‚Äúcomputing‚Äù power on display is unmatched.",

Sure we may think AI will first come for the menial jobs but to corporations, profits will always be the goal, so anything that disrupts that will be eliminated.\n\nNow, the biggest expanse in a corporation is, most often than not, its payroll, so our minds go towards AI eliminating that, but I'd also say that when the AI sees the book and then the *real book* with all the shady dealings and money being diverted they'll also eliminate that. AI may screw up a village in Thailand for profits, pollute a river in the amazon by mistake, and one thing it will not care about as well is people scratching each others' back. In the end, I think corruption, bias, bad managerial skills may very well be one of the first things AI goes after and I hope I'm alive to see it. \n\n(The assumption here is whoever programmed the AI did not input their own bias into it or a \"true\" AI that works independent of its first coding.)\n\nWhat y'all think?
