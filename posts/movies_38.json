I really enjoyed EEAaO but it feels so strange to me that Todd, and Tar, are getting so little awards season love, when really, I think 10, 20, 30 years from now, if people had to vote on adding a film from this past year to something like the Sight and Sound list, I think it'd be Tar.",

There are a few movies that i absolutely love such as Manchester by the sea, tarantino movies and the creed/rocky trilogy. I would love to get more into movies and catch up with the rest of the world, any recommendations anyone has of movies that everyone should see would be greatly appreciated as i’ve always been really impressed and moved by the movies that i’ve seen but i’ve never had any recommendations to get me more into film. Any recommendations would be appreciated :)\n\ni should probably mention also that i’m not a big horror fan because I absolutely hate anticipation and being on the edge of my seat, I also find it hard to sit through really long movies due to having a short attention span. I don’t need a movie to have stuff going on constantly but i recently seen Casino and towards the end i found it insanely hard to sit through the rest of it. I’m sorry if this is so picky but i think the more movies i watch, i will be able to sit through and appreciate slower movies.",

        "text": "So today I decided to watch The Wailing, and boy was I glad that I did. I’m starting to slowly think this is one of my favorites, but others beg to differ saying that the ending was sloppy or that the director threw in the plot twist for the hell of it. But here is what I think.\n\nThroughout the movie we had the same perspective as Jong-goo the entire time, confused on what the hell is going on. Typically throughout a movie we can tell by the formula on how it’s going to play out, but I couldn’t find myself doing that in this one. To put it into better words:\n\nWe trusted the shaman just as Jong-goo, we thought the Japanese man was the one cursing the town just like Jong-goo, we thought the lady in white was helping Jong-goo but still a bit skeptical of her because of the lack of her screen time. Towards the ending we all think that the Ghost Girl is evil after the shaman pukes blood. We are literally on the edge of our seats thinking wtf is going on. Even when Jong-goo is with the ghost girl the shaman we trust tells us not to believe her and after we had this seed planted in our head like Jong-goo the final straw was seeing the ghost girl wearing the items of previously cursed victims. We all would’ve done the same thing if we were in the shoes of our protagonist. I don’t think I ever felt so connected to a protagonist like I did in this movie. I’m not very good at writing or expressing my thoughts but I hope you can understand what I mean. \n\nPlease let me know what you guys thought of this amazing movie.",

I love Tarantino films but put it off until this morning.  I finished it and thought it was great. Before going to the Internet, I wen to talk to my friends about what they thought of the film.  They mentioned the Charles mansion thing and all of his children and the ranch. That completely went over my head throughout the whole film.  So, watching it without knowing that I came to my own interpretation.  At the beginning of the film Rick goes to diner with A guy Can you tell him it’s careers on the backend and he needs to go film in Italy.  Upset Rick goes home, and vents to Cliff.  The neighbor drives by, and Rick gets optimistic, stating that he is one pool party away from a big role.  Throughout the movie is a series of stories until the end.  The last scene Rick is in his pool when the hippies come, and he takes them all out which leads to an invite to the neighbors house for drinks.  I believe Tarantino used that opening scene and Rick saying he was one pool party away as a metaphor “pool party” for what was to come. The movie ends and he goes in for drinks inferring that this was the “one pool party” that we can assume revives his career.   That was what I got from it.  Similar to the Big Lebawski almost.",

This woman interacts with the main character throughout the moive.\n\n\\- There is a cave with jail bars where those who retaliate against the government's order are thrown into.\n\n\\- Near the end, we see the office of the \"head of the government.\" His desk looks very futuristic. A scene takes place in there (maybe a fight? an argument? something like that)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is all I can remember.

Both are actually fighting against exploitation based on their work in their earlier part of the movie (events as they happened); what intrigued me was the commonality in their nationality. I couldn't help but wonder if there was any other reason for both the directors to be influenced - political, social or even the producers - to have cast Filipinos for the roles or is it just plain coincidence. Once again, I have no intention of singling out any nationalities and I have heard some of the most terrible stories of even Pakistanis, Bangaldeshis and Indians treated horribly in Europe and Middle East for instance. Exploitation, living &amp; working conditions raise serious concerns for people from lower/middle class from developing countries with overseas jobs - the most recent one being their plight in the Middle East, for FIFA in Qatar (an example). And while I am happy that there is some light shone on their plight, I couldn't help but wonder if there was another reason to this awakening.",

I remember that before if you bought your ticket through fandango Rotten Tomatoes could verify that you saw the movie. But now I don't see that option when I leave my review. Does any know how verify that I saw the movie?",

Will you go with actor? Perhaps the best five Denzel Washington movies. Or go more obscure, the best five Bob Hoskins movies. \n\nMaybe go with a shared location, like the five best submarine movies. Or subject matter. Five best movies about horse racing.\n\nAre you going to go with obvious movies everyone will love? Or deep cuts, or obscure subject matter to showcase your unique film knowledge? Five best adaptations of your favorite author? Five best movies by your favorite cinematographer? Five best movies where a main character drives a Camaro?\n\nGet creative!",
