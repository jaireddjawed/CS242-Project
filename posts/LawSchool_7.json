I hate all my classes, any time I think about law school or having to practice law in the future I have to hold back tears or things start not feeling real anymore and worse I'm behind in basically everything, failed a few assignments and one course I don't understand anything aside from topic 1. At one point even just looking at the school building would get me upset. The counselling at the school is so overloaded that you are lucky it you get an appointment after 4 weeks and as luck would have it due an assignment I forgot about mine and it was pushed back 5 weeks after I had waited 4 weeks to get it. When I spoke to the student services, they told me to \"do some yoga and see it that helps!\". I realised from early year 3 that I never wanted to do law but felt stuck since so much money has gone into this, but I'm tired of feeling I'm fighting every day, tired of feeling incompetent everyday and tired of spending half a decade doing something that I have no interest in just because it is a more stable career path. I envy the students in my class who enjoy learning the law and feel all the stress is worthwhile. I really don't think the experience should be this taxing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSummary: A very exhausted student venting about being in law school.",

Where I end up is not confirmed, but for the purposes of this post let’s assume McGill. I’ve spent the last year or so purely focusing on law school applications and really enjoyed the LSAT process, but over the last few days have stumbled across post after post discouraging the pursuit of law and painting a somber picture of what life is like following graduation. \n\nTo add some personal context, I didn’t exactly pursue law blindly. I graduated in management and have been working in public sector consulting over the last two years. I enjoy certain aspects of my job, including the constant change in the nature of tasks, the writing and my involvement in our strategy. However, I can’t get away from the feeling that all my efforts are purely for the purposes of enriching the company’s bottom lime, and in the long term, I feel like I would ideally be contributing to causes I care more about. Ironically, I would love to work in fields like anti-corruption or those relating to international development, trade or economics. \n\nI know jobs in agencies like the UN are highly desired and extremely hard to get into. However, if I were to begin building a relevant skillset throughout my JD at McGill and trying to work in related fields as early as possible – is it a realistic possibility to work in the fields of law I am interested in, or will I most likely regret forgoing my current career trajectory for a legal education?",

Besides Quimbee lessons and the Barbri 1L mastery course that I have a free subscription for, are there any supplemental books you recommend that go over the material well, have practice essays I can test out my understanding, or any other (preferably free) resources y'all recommend?",

        "text": "Hi all:\n\nDo you think I have a character and fitness issue ahead of me? I go back and forth because it is not a crime by any means, but it is a shitty situation, not really by my doing. Anyway, here is the story, please bear with me and let me know your thoughts.\n\nBefore going to law school, I was fired from a job I held. They told me it was due to performance issues, even though there was some question as to whether or not this was true. I received good performance reports before and never had issues, and I heard rumors from other co-workers that the company had financial issues that might've forced them to have to fire someone (aka me). It sucks to lose your job, but I moved on and found a new job within a week, where they sponsored me for a security clearance (more on that later).\n\nAbout two weeks later, just after I was offered my new job, my former boss (the CEO of the company that fired me) called me out of the blue in the middle of the day. There was a negative review posted on Glassdoor, and he accused me of writing it. He said I breached our separation agreement and NDA that I signed upon being terminated. I was shocked because I had never really been on Glassdoor much, I did not have an account, and thus, I did not write the review. He tried to get me to admit to doing it, but I did not admit to doing it because I didn't write it, and he hung up on me.\n\nAfter this, he allegedly asked the remaining employees in the office if anyone had written this, contacted old employees and asked them to write good reviews to improve the company rating, and even called Glassdoor asking them to doxx the writer of that review (which they refused to do due to company policy).\n\nI sent my former boss an email later that day reiterating that I did not write the letter, and I sent him my internet history from the day the review was written, showing that I did not visit Glassdoor. He thanked me for doing this and said he would fulfill his obligations under the separation agreement.\n\nBut this is where it gets worse. Remember how I mentioned my new job required a security clearance? I was in the approval process for my security clearance when I was asked to interview with the federal agency that conducts background checks for security clearances. I did the interview, and my former boss absolutely tore me to shreds when the investigators called him (I listed his company as my former employer). He continued to accuse me of writing the Glassdoor review and also claimed I was a terrible employee, I was impulsive and threatened him, etc. I told the investigators his claims were false, and I was positive my security clearance would be denied. \n\nI was so concerned that I almost discussed getting a lawyer involved to write my former boss a cease and desist letter. However, I did end up receiving my security clearance.\n\nFast forward to today, I am a 3L who's applied for the bar and has a BL job lined up. However, I am sort of concerned that this issue above will be a C&amp;F problem. I go back and forth in my head about it.\n\nHere's why I am not concerned:\n\n\\- It's the one red flag about me.\n\n\\- It's not a crime, and getting fired from your job is not the worst thing in the world (NOTE: I disclosed my termination and the reason for termination that they told me to the jurisdiction I am taking the bar in). Generally, I imagine some bar applicants have far worse in their backgrounds.\n\n\\- I have good personal references, including people who worked with me at this company (they have all moved on to new jobs), that will say good things about me. I consider them my close friends, and I'm even in one of their weddings. I also have personal references from lawyers that I worked with this past summer.\n\n\\- Despite my former boss trashing me to a federal investigator, I still received my security clearance (and the government entrusted me with classified info).\n\nBut, here's why I am concerned:\n\n\\- I know the Bar Association will talk to my former boss, since I listed his company as my former employer.\n\n\\- I'm confident he will say the same lies to them (I've also heard he's humiliated because after he fired me, I went to a top 30 law school, had success, got a BL job at a solid firm, etc.)\n\n\\- If one took what he said as the truth, it probably reflects poorly on my character and fitness to be a lawyer. \n\nAny thoughts on this would be much appreciated. If you read all of this, THANK YOU.",

No dice. I’ve always relied on Barbri lectures and outlines in addition to what’s presented in class so I’m going to take a look at their material over spring break.

Last week was midterms and we got our grades back this week. For the writing class, my paper was the lowest score. In contracts, my paper *and* multiple choice were the lowest in class. I have homework due tomorrow and can barely focus.\n\nI am shocked that contracts went terrible. I understood what the questions were asking, but I guess I just didn't pick the right letter. How can I change this around? Is it too late already (1L1)? I am scared it's over and I will be kicked out over poor grades. I go to class, listen to the lectures in-person and the recordings, have an outline, and yet this happens. There are people who come to class high or watch Youtube videos during lectures and I am baffled that they scored higher than me. \n\nI wish I could talk to my mom, but she has so much on her plate and I feel like this would crush her. I am scared of being kicked out of school. It's not the best school on the rankings (as I have heard after a certain number they get pretty predatory), so I am upset if they kick me out over grades. \n\nI don't know what to do, but any advice is much appreciated! Thank you!",

I am unable to rely on parents or anyone else for any financial assistance whatsoever and have been completely on my own since 17 (I am now 23).\n\nI am strongly considering withdrawing after this semester due to the lack of opportunities for evening students, the inability to quit my job for a summer internship, and the fact that I am having an extremely hard time putting my all into this while working 40 hours a week and commuting 40 minutes each way by train to school. \n\nBasically, I want to know if going back would ever be an option. I do want to finish school, but I want to be able to do it right. Ideally in a few years I would be able to save up enough to go to school full time.\n\nIf there are any former night students here who had similar experiences and are now practicing (or not), or if anyone withdrew and returned at a later point in time, any insight or advice helps.\n\nAlso - I expect to be sitting at about a 3.2 GPA at the end of this year, which is my lowest ever and very discouraging.",

I know people with SAD sometimes do that as winter approaches, and perhaps knowing I’m entering into a time of tremendous stress (+ less time for exercise, sleep, etc) makes it a good idea for me. On the other hand, the PA who prescribed them for me is of the opinion that I should just wait and see how I manage.\n\nDoes anyone have similar experiences?

Im all set up basically for Ohio, just need to take the UBE.  \n\nI have a few things going on in my life and I think the best move for me is to move to Illinois for family matters. I was looking over the requirements for approval into the Illinois Bar. The website states all first year students must file \"Law Student Registration application.\" It states that if you are not a first year student then you must get approval from the board. How do I go about getting this approval? Do I just email them asking for approval?  Is it to late for me to apply for the July Bar in Illinois? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWould it be easier to take the UBE in Ohio as I had originally planed and then upon passage of the UBE transfer my score to Illinois?",
