The only problem is I don't know where to find these friends. \n\nI've tried joining clubs, but I've had little success. \n\nI tried an anime club and a chess club, two interests I like, but outside of liking anime/chess I couldn't relate to anyone I met there, and I didn't like either of those two things to the extent necessary to justify being in those clubs.\n\nI tried joining a dnd club because I've heard of so many people finding lifelong friends through it, but I genuinely didn't find dnd fun no matter how much I tried to force myself to like it. \n\nI've tried going out to bars after turning 21 but I end up either being in my corner or never seeing the people I talked to that night ever again. \n\nI go to the gym but nobody talks to each other there unless they come in together or already knew each other.\n\nI've heard of how people make friends through gaming but, same case as with dnd, I genuinely just don't have fun playing video games either no matter how much I tried to get into it.\n\nAnd finally, maybe the solution would've been somewhere in here if the circumstances were different, what I'd consider my one true passion in life is both making/producing and listening to music. Unfortunately, a club for music nerds is non-existent on my school's campus.\n\nMy problems are further exacerbated by the fact I live a whole 30 minute drive away from my uni's campus and live with family so I can't just befriend whoever is in my non-existent dorm building. So naturally, a huge bulk of my free time is spent by myself. I luckily still have one close friend from childhood that I'm in contact with, but one friend isn't enough.\n\nI feel like I'm doomed.",

I often am not invited to events, or at events I feel socially awkward and out of place as if I don’t belong in any of the groups I am in. \n\nIt must be the energy or vibe I’m giving off but not sure where it’s coming from. Is it anxiety, depression, try-hard-ness, not trying hard enough-ness?\n\nHere’s an example: today at the workplace there was a tornado warning so everyone went to the staircase. While there everyone started chatting amongst themselves and making jokes with the entire group, and I felt like I was just there. I feel like something is expected of me so I feel like there’s attention on me so I wanted to contribute but couldn’t.  So I was just kind of there taking up space. That feeling happens a lot.",

Even the people who likes these topics find me too weird when i talk too much, but it's just because i'm too excited..\n\nNow i just stay away from everyone because there's no one for me, it would be cool to have someone to come at me and talk about what we like for hours but.. In reality it's just too awkward and i have the feeling i'm alone and by myself everytime.\n\n\n\nDid anyone already feel that way? And if yes, please help me.",

Then it dredges up every other little thing this person has done to irritate me in the past month and by that point it’s over and I’m being a total bitch.\nIn those moments of anger I feel justified, then about ten minutes later I realize I’ve just made everyone feel like shit and not fixed anything.\n\nI’ve tried talking to this person, explaining what’s wrong, tried to come up with compromises and solutions and everything tried seems to blow up in my face.\n\nI’m at a loss here.",

Also my husband works out of town, and I have 2 toddlers, so I’m struggling with exhaustion/burnt out somewhat. I’m the only one with kids, and feel so guilty every time I have to call in because one of the kids is sick. I used to bring in baked treats or order from my favorite bakery, but no one ever said or ate any so I stopped. There was one incident with a coworker, where she thought I was lying about an email I sent, because she said she snooped our ChurnZero account, and if I would have sent the email to the client it would have been there. I got on a call and shared my screen to show her, and then she brushed it off. It’s a small team and they are a tight knit group, and I feel like I’m just not part of the team. I wish I could go to happy hours, tennis, etc after, but I just can’t. I live across town and my main priority is to be a stable parent to my kids. At my previous company, I had so many positive friendships, and still talk to several of them on a daily basis.",

        "text": "I was working on some reports with two colleagues who are more junior than me (one of them (female) is in my team, the other (male) is in another team who I had never met but was asked to help out). We communicated via a group chat on Teams to discuss the work and a few weeks later I thought of asking the male colleague to go for coffee because I had never met and thought it would be nice to network, get to know people in other teams in such a big company, put a face to a name etc. \n\nSo I messaged him on Teams saying things like, how's things going, was wondering if you'd be free to go for a coffee sometime, thought it'd be nice to put a face to a name after working on those reports\" etc. He replied saying \"been well thanks, but busy the past few weeks. Sounds like a plan\" and then I said I was generally in the office on such and such day, if that suit you etc and then he never replied, just left me on \"read\" on Teams. \n\nSo, my question is, is it just not the done thing to ask a colleague to go for a coffee? Or did it potentially come off the wrong way, give him the wrong idea given it's a male colleague? I told another colleague of mine and he said that it could come across as a bit strange for a more senior person to ask a junior colleague to go for coffee whereas it wouldn't be as strange if it was the other way round?? \n\nPersonally, I'm not sure there's a difference between the whole junior/senior thing. I was thinking maybe it's because it's a male colleague I'm asking. But it's not as if it's a male senior colleague asking a junior female colleague so I'm not sure if I'm just overthinking. If I'm not overthinking then surely it's a bit rude to not reply at all? He did seem pretty nice from the limited interactions I had about work so I genuinely just wanted to get to know him and more people at work since I'm still fairly new to the company.\n\nThoughts?",

The general feeling I get from him is that anytime he needs to do something, he needs to be a smart ass about it. If I make a minor mistake in anything, he'll immediately be all over them. He uses a ridiculous amount of hyperbole and makes certain things about me be a constant running joke. I just smile and try to laugh it off but I really don't like it. \n\nHe's a friend of friends and I sit a couple of seats next to him as well, so when there's a mid-sized crowd or when doing a group project, I'll inevitably encounter him which is why I can't just ignore him. Though, I basically don't talk to him unless spoken to.\n\nThere were some times when he tried to play nice such as inviting me to places with mutual friends or whatever, but if he sees me again he can always switch back to being condescending if he wants. Which is what I don't like tbh. It feels like he has power over me: he knows he can choose to be nice or not and it's up to him and his mood, not that I have power over that decision.\n\nWhat could I do about it? To be very honest, I'm kinda scared of calling him out. I'm timid and socially awkward. I'm not good at arguing at all. So if I did that he'd run circles around me and make me out to be the odd one.

I've been kinda introverted throughout my life , but have tried to change it in the past few months after my college started , by trying to be more of a cheerful person and socializing more.\n\nIt worked well , I made quite a lot of (friends?) . The thing is I have this problem of always putting others first before mine (not trying to brag about it , but I'm really a non-pretentious nice person) .\n\nI've always sent assignments and notes to all people who have asked me for it , although most of them don't appreciate my help , it has become an obsessive behavior to help people out now. As I said , I tried to talk to literally everyone , (small talk has been quite taxing , but I did get over it) , but I feel like no one vibes well with me. It feels like people have interests that don't align with mine. I get feeling of being used up. The only texts I get from them are related to academics. My absence on social media could be a reason , but oh please! don't tell me that I should be on that shitty Instagram and Snapchat to view their fake lives. (Yes , the only things that matter to me in a person is genuineness) I'm not trying to be picky of someone's flaws here , it's like everyone has found a best-friend to hang out with , whereas I get easily frustrated with any kind of gossip that happens and hence I hate everyone.\n\nFML \n\nTLDR: idk what I just vented out , thanks for reading tho , have a good day!

And every time I see her I make small talk with her like I would with anyone. I do think she is pretty but never said anything to her I wouldn’t say to anyone at my work. And had no intention of asking her out at this point. \n\nI just make very basic convo, such as, “Hey, how’s the day going? You pretty busy? How’s school? And then maybe try to throw a joke in there so it’s not just a boring conversation. \n\nBut it’s like she doesn’t reciprocate at all. When she sees me it’s like she immediately tries to go the other direction, and asks nothing to keep the conversation going. She does kinda smile and appear shy, but I just feel anxious because I’ve never had anyone react this way to small talk. Even if she doesn’t want to be asked out by men, or she has a boyfriend or whatever, it’s still no excuse to actively avoid small talk for 45 seconds. Unless she’s just highly socially anxious. \n\nAt this point I’m not sure what to do. I just feel like it’s wrong to avoid someone at work who has only shown basic, everyday  interest. I want to understand the social world better. Please list some possibilities of what’s going on if you can. Thanks",

One of our friends (his co-resident’s husband, let’s call him K), suggested some of us med spouses get together and do our own fun thing this Tuesday night while our S/Os are at our dinner. Makes sense. He’s the only one in our group who has a kid (a 4 year old) and was especially excited because they already have the babysitter scheduled, so he’d like to take advantage of a child-free night.\n\nWhile he initiated the idea of plans, I suggested we extend the invite to a few other resident spouses we hang out. Total, there are 6 of us. It soon became clear that K has very different ideas of what he’d like to do Tuesday night than the rest of us. \n\nI suggested bowling, or trivia, or dinner - while he’s thinking some combo of laser tag/escape room/karaoke bar (about 30 miles away from us). WITH dinner and drinks thrown in there. I hate to be a buzzkill, but I do not want to drink or be out late on a Tuesday night as I have a very mentally taxing corporate day job. K, on the other hand, works for himself and has more flexibility.\n\nThe rest of us in the group seem to be on the same page as me about a more low-key Tuesday evening… at least one that doesn’t involve hopping from activity to activity and drinking in between. However, I feel responsible for suggesting we invite the others (who share my sentiments), and not being game to give K the child-free evening he’s looking forward to. How do I get rid of my guilt? Is it unreasonable for me to think his request is unreasonable?",

Now I am just an introvert. I have very strict parent so I am also time bounded. Also my financial state is not very good. At the start of my college I put effort in getting to know many people and quickly became friends with many. Though I am not good with talking and also am very secretive? Reserved? \nSo today I have been thinking how my friends always hang out outside of college and they never invite me. Well they invited once but the plan was cancelled because one of them could not make it to the trip. I never get calls to just talk, only for the favours. \nNow one might say it's because they are not real friends but maybe I am unable to connect with people in some way others does? I don't involve in conversation much and I also don't call them. Although I hang out with them during college time but I don't show much excitement about trips because of my personality. \nAs an introvert, there are some people you feel homely around?? You feel like it's just ok?? Idk... But there is one in that group like that for me (no romantic interest tho). But they too never reach out to me. \nSo do I need to improve or make new friends??

Now as a 22 year old guy, I’m much happier and content with my life but still have trouble physically smiling. I’ve come to wonder if it was my lack of smiling growing up that rendered the facial muscles involved in the mechanism of smiling dormant and poorly trained. I find that whenever I want to laugh or try to crack a smile, my lower face feels physically strained and my facial muscles almost feel exhausted from disuse like any other muscle.

        "text": "Maybe someone can help me understand. First of all, I know I'm a sheepish, insecure, out of touch big guy. Sometimes I try to play it cool around people, but there's always people who can zero in on how odd I am, and that I'm faking being aware of what's going on. People love giving me a hard time, and confuse my sheepish awkward nature for stupidity. So they like to mess with me. \n\nI know not to get angry or try to stick up for myself, it always backfires and they have fun with that as well. I go to parties or try to meet new people, but my friends who brought me never help me out - I would think if people saw I'm having a hard time getting comfortable they wouldn't be so hard on me. It makes me seem uptight and weird, because once I start getting mocked or interrogated with sarcastic interest from people playfully trying to act like they give a shit, I just lock up and freeze. People can tell I'm uncomfortable, and I become a klutz and very self conscious. \n\nInstead of feeling bad for me, good people just pity me, and those who hate people like me seem to get disgusted and dislike me. \n\nWhat pisses me off, is these types of cool people are clever, smart, and are more successful than I'll ever be. It's like people who lack empathy get the most out of life. Like, they don't feel guilt at all. It's why I don't even bother trying to retort, they just use what I say against me and don't give a shit. They admire these traits in others as well. \n\nI get why people are put off by me, but I grew up kind of repressed and I feel balled up like I'm afraid to express myself. I just don't know how to be like this. \n\nPerhaps some of you know the type of people I'm talking about. Growing up it seemed like every teenager was like this to some degree, and I don't have that air of confidence and coherent clever talk, lilke most people have. There are people who keep me around and act like good friends, but I can tell they hold back around me, and only hang out with me in specific conditions like one on one, but in a group I fade into the background or I'm treated like the weird guy. \n\nIt irritates some people the way I am, like I'm overly scared and immature, inexperienced, and basically a dork. \n\nI'm not going to get anywhere in life if I can't figure out how to get along and feel a part of this society. Or at least I won't be able to live the life I want to live. \n\nI don't want to be treated with kid gloves anymore, and I want to stop getting thrown off so easily when I'm even just teased by a person. My mind just depresses and I turn into a bumbling mess. Even teenager can do this to me to a degree. \n\nI'm overpowered very easily, basically speaking. People are always trying to mess with me, sometimes just to get me to open up, but I'm afraid to because I'm just going to embarrass myself. They'll see the guy who doesn't have a clue, tries too hard, and sadly seems inexperienced in life. \n\nI missed out on a lot of growing up, and I just feel stupid not knowing how to grow out of this...",

I know a lot of people who are similar personality types as me and are generally introverted and quiet and don't get perceived this way. In my head, I'm just a laid back, reserved, chill but still confident person but I have no idea why others don't see me that way.

I had met this girl who was also new but from the same city and school board I was from and our classrooms were beside each other and I found her to be cool and she seemed normal unlike the rest of the staff.  For whatever reason not many people liked me at the school.  Its a small town and they just looked at me from the beginning with scowls on their faces. The families at the school and I had different ideas of the meaning of school, I am very strong on academics but also personable and the parents would ask me to \"play more\" (their kids were 12 and all failing when I came in) anyway the year ended and as it did I noticed this fellow teacher became super fake with me (Id ask \"how are you?\" Shed respond \"how are you?\" Everytime w this fake tone) so Id understood she really didnt want to be anything more than colleagues.  The year ended and at the end of the year she gives me this gift card for a mani pedi it was worth like $100 or so and I thought wow but Id realized she was paying me off for all the help I gave her throughout the year.  I just felt that was what she was doing.  So after the year ended we spoke once more ovee the phone because we'd both changed contracts.  She seemed fine on the phone but I decided not to reach out anymore as Id understood she didnt care.  Anyway 2 years go by I have another child and Ive been working at the virtual school.  Its been going super well I love it for many reasons but mostly because I dont have to deal w nasty ppl.  Anyway I did make 2 friends at the school who are a married couple, they also see ex colleague sometimes because their daughters are friends. They tell me how no one liked me at the school etc.  I honestly dont even understand why but it gets to me.  I was only kind to everyone at the school but for whatever reason they didnt take to me.  We didnt even socialize ever because of covid.  Anyway back to ex colleague.  So through thr years Id ask about her to.ppl seeing how she is.  I NEVER said a bad word about her.  I never treated her in any way badly.  I did confide in her alot which maybe made her uncomfortable I dont know.  If she was, she certainly lies well.  Anyway I finally saw her after 2 years at the christmas show for our kids and she completely avoided me covering her face while crossing me my husband and new baby.  Then I ran into her a few days ago while picking up my son and I said hi and she looked like she saw a ghost.  She said hi gave me the dirtiest look and ran off w her daughter as if I were a murderer.  Wtf?  Idk why but all this hatred toward me from this town is really getting me down.  I honestly dont even know what to do anymore or how to be.  Its making me so upset.  Any advice on where to go from here? And no I refuse to ask her what's wrong.",
