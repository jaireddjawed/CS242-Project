        "text": "Okay, so I'm a very new GM, and very new to D&amp;D as a whole. However, I've taken the time to try and go through the rules as extensively as I can (on and off, absorbing things for a year or so) and watching various D&amp;D shows and reading up on helpful GM/DM advice. All this is so that I can try and successfully run a homebrew campaign for some uni friends. I know that that might see a little ambitious I know, but it seems to be going at least okay for a couple of sessions.\n\nMy party is a group of my friends, and we all get along well. I'll give a little cast list, just in case I decide to share any more stories down the line, should I prove entertaining enough.\nWe have:\n*The Cleric: A half-elf bastard son of the player's previous (dead) character from a different campaign. His shtick is that he is an intentionally anime edgy protagonist kind of guy. He is also a sort of straight man for the group, and is only really into adventuring for the money.\n*The Druid: Cleric's gf (OOC and jokingly pushed for IC). An Elf girl who is almost a parody of the socially awkward magical girl, stumbling into civilisation because her magical ruins in the forest gave her a vision that her home might be in danger.\n*The Rogue: Stats are very polarised, very high DEX and INT but has abysmal CHA and bad WIS. An ex street gang urchin driven from his city due to a hostile gang takeover. He has no social skills, and is driven almost entirely by a paranoid desire to survive.\n*The Warlock: My gf. His thing is that he is an alcoholic, kicked out by his wife for being drunk one too many times. He stumbled off, accidentally made a pact with what he thought was his god (based off of the sun from the Tellytubbies) and then drunkenly hitch-hiked his way to adventure.\n\nNot the most conventional or serious characters, but it's what we're sort of going for.\n___________________________________________________\n\nAfter a meet-up of characters that admittedly could have been a little better thought out and perhaps more engaging right off of the bat (thank the gods for forgiving players). My mysterious hooded figure cliche left the group at the tavern corner table. As some of the group are completely inexperienced, and others are only marginally more so, I thought that the best way to gauge the groups understanding of combat would be to give them a simple starter encounter, expecting only a few minutes of play. The encounter I chose to do was a smallish infestation of rats in the tavern cellar. The promise of putting up the adventurers for a while as a favour seemed like a good incentive and established a nice base for the party. It was very simple: Go into the cellar, get attacked by rats, defeat the rats, get free lodging and food for now.\n\nThe first thing I've learned about GMing is that even with a good amount of planning, things can still catch you off guard.\n_______________________________________\n\nSo the first thing that happened is the Druid decides to talk to the rats and try and persuade them to leave of their own accord. This worked with her sort of parody Disney princess vibe. She beat the cleric in a persuasion-off to convince the Inkeeper to let her try and handle the situation. The party followed her into the cellar.\n\nNow this rat infestation is intended to be linked to the presence of wererats, which themselves are linked to the activities of a future arc villain. As such, I felt that the rats were magically agitated, and not likely to listen to the Druid's attempts to get them to leave peacefully. The rats wanted them gone. Unfortunately, due to terrible rolls from the rats, their attacks all missed. My ensuing description of a bunch of small furry animals failing to chomp through her toes sort of incited the Druid to pity them more than want to retaliate. The Warlock triggered a bigger swarm of rats to come attack though. In response to this, the druid ran all the way out of the cellar and halfway out of the tavern itself, the rogue standing at the door slammed it shut on the approaching horde of rats (theoretically managing to deal an impressive negative 1 damage thanks to me quickly and unthinkingly ruling the attack a 1d4 plus a negative STR mod). While the Warlock and Cleric proceeded to deal with the rats, the Druid sheepishly returned to the cellar door, peeked down, \"noped\" and then basically abandoned the others to wait in the tavern.\n\nThe Warlock remembered that he could do cantrips, and eldritch blasted the remaining swarm to pieces, leaving two stragglers for the rogue to skewer with his dagger.\n_________________________________\n\nThis was meant to be the small encounter to test the waters, before the party engaged in an actual quest. It turned out to be perhaps nearly an hour and a half due to new player hesitation and general indecision, coupled with running away from a weak swarm of rats and forgetting that magic is a thing.\n\nThe good news is that things have progressed in terms of combat thanks to a more successful second session and encounter. Unfortunately, the event has still left me with an IC Cleric who hates his party and ended up being stalked by them into joining them for said second quest.\n(I had actually provided for the chance of the Cleric leaving the group and looking for others to work with, mostly because we have a little jokey standoff going on of how far he can push me off of what he thinks is the straight path.)",

        "text": "Well, I called it. The full party still hasn’t been assembled, but we’re up to four people now. The Paladin was out, but our Cleric finally has a working computer and was able to join.\n\nThe Party:    \n\nDamien, the LG Paladin - The unofficial party leader. Unavailable to play due to computer issues. Party was definitely worse off without him.\n\nLuvLock, the NN Warlock - Interrupted the gaming session to change his arcane focus from a book to an orb so that it would match his picture. Note: No one can see this picture. All you see in game is the face of his character. Previously, his arcane focus has been a staff, a different orb, and a cat. I told him he can’t change it any more.\n\nMidir, the NN Gladiator - Was having trouble getting into character until I told him to play like he’s an MMA fighter or boxer. He doesn’t just fight. He entertains. He should do things like flourishes and taunts. After telling him that, he really started playing his character better.\n\nSir Elvenbeard the Vast, the CN Pirate - Still loves stealing and drinking. Misses his ship. I noticed that on his character sheet, he has “So sexy it hurts” listed as his sole flaw. I know some DMs who would get all upset about a player not taking things seriously, but I appreciate the Right Said Fred reference, so I’m letting him keep it.\n\nSir Richard Burns, the LN Cleric - After two sessions of passively sitting back and offering minimal healing, he’s ready to smite some evil. And he loves smiting evil. \n\nThe party slowly descended the winding staircase from the attic of the house to the basement. Although the word basement doesn’t really do it justice. The place was more of a dungeon. There was no light and the walls were hewn from the ground itself, with supports placed every 5 feet to keep the ceiling from becoming the floor. The first thing the party encountered were the coffins of the family who had occupied the house. An investigation revealed all of them were empty. The remains of the two children, Rose and Thorn, are in the attic, but where are the remains of their parents? The party quickly closed the coffins and left the crypt. \n\nThe next room they found was a dining room. Various bones, both animal and human, were scattered about the floor the Warlock noticed an odd rustling noise coming from a darkened corner. When he investigated, LuvLock was attacked by a ghoul. The party fought off the ghoul and continued searching the basement. They discovered several traps and fought off an ambush of ghouls before arriving in a large room, the walls of which were lined with moldy skeletons. At one end of the room were large statues of a severe looking man and a wolf. The statue of the man was holding a crystalline orb in its outstretched hand. The Warlock saw the orb, and [had to have it](https://68.media.tumblr.com/05d99df3d5732cacb835d8f1c3e17333/tumblr_nju3y0zjpm1s2wio8o1_500.gif). There was nothing magical going on. He just wanted the shiny. As soon as he touched the orb, five shadows appeared and began attacking him. They got a couple of attacks in and nearly drained his strength to zero. And then it was the Cleric’s turn. Channeling the power of his god, he called forth the power of the sun the shadows melted away. The rest of the party sat there amazed. With one attack and without any apparent effort, the Cleric had just cleared the entire room of enemies.\n\nAfter the shock wore off, the party continued their investigations. They found several abandoned rooms complete with chests of loot. The Pirate got to work unlocking the chests and the party found several gems, a silvered sword, a fancy eyepatch, and bag made of human skin. The pirate really wanted the eyepatch, but so did the Warlock. The Warlock made sparks and smoke come off the eyepatch in an effort to convince the Pirate the item was cursed. The Pirate failed his wisdom check and begged the Warlock the taked the cursed item away from him. The Paladin quiety observed the exchange, shaking his head in exasperation. As they continued exploring the basement, they came to a staircase going down into darkness. They all heard faint chanting coming up out of the darkness.\n\nAnd on that cliffhanger, we ended for the night. I really think the story of the Paladin smiting five enemies at once with holy light is going to one of those highlights that that the group tells other people about whenever they get the chance. It was a pretty epic moment that caused the whole party to break out in cheers.\n",

        "text": "I have a group that is very roleplay oriented. If they can they will almost always take the option to talk their way out of the situation or avoid it entirely. Of course, this means that I design my encounters to be able to be talked out of, but if things go south then guns blazing works too.\n\nThe characters in this game are transplanted from a previous Pathfinder campaign that survived the Gap by hiding out in Soul Gems. One their very best and dear friends, a Paladin of Shelyn, for some reason didn't take on a new body like everyone else (the player couldn't continue due to life circumstances). Shelyn is also one of the deities that didn't make it across the Gap.\n\nIn this particular situation they were recruited by a local Eoxian administrator to deal with a terrorist cell outside the city. They were given coordinates and a buggy and sent off. After being chased by wraiths and welcomed into the compound, they discover that the \"terrorists\" worship Shelyn... sort of. What little of her teachings survived the Gap have obviously been twisted and turned for the worse as the terrorists now destroy in her name, believing the beaurocracy and utilitarianism of Eox to be antithetical to Shelyn's teachings. Also list to the Gap is Shelyn's name.\n\nI had prepared a fairly large multi-session roleplay playground with intrigue, stolen artifacts, factions within the terrorist cell, a bombing, and many other such roleplay delights. But one fateful conversation changed the course of the game. This is the summary of a conversation between two NPCs, a human named Marigold and an undead Lashunta named Strawberry\n\nMarigold: (in a ditzy hippie accent) \"Would you like to learn about the goddess of love and beauty, Shelly?\"  \nStrawberry: (sounding like a bored teenager) \"Uhh, it's actually Sheila.\"  \nMarigold: \"Well, actually we don't know her real name. *I* call her *Shelly* and Strawberry here calls her *Sheila*.\"\n\nIt's at this point our Technomancer who used to be a Witch in Pathfinder speaks up. She's the cold, pragmatic type who sees everyone around her not as friends or comrades, but as useful lackeys. You'd be hard pressed to elicit a strong emotional reaction from her, but apparently disrespecting the name of her former friend's Goddess is a line you do not cross.\n\nHer: \"I shoot them.\"  \nMe: \"Hah yeah they're pretty annoying, right?\"  \nHer: \"No, I kill them all.\"  \n\nAnd with that the roleplay encounter turned into a bloodbath. The players recover their artifact and rig a bomb to destroy the compound. \n\nIt's not often I'm happy to throw out hours of prep time, but in this case I'm overjoyed. To know that I pushed their buttons hard enough to cause them to glass two dozen people and their homes over the memory of a character warms my GM heart.",

        "text": "This recurring villain wasn't the Big Bad, but was an imp sorcerer that liked to use clever tactics to ambush the party.  In fact, they had been forced to run from the nighttime fight where he was raining down fireballs on them from too high up to see, as they fought several minor fireproof creatures on the ground.\n\nThis time, in the middle of stemming a minotaur invasion (not much danger to the party, but they have to work fast to save the locals), some random peasant walked out of a tavern and launched a nasty offensive spell at the party.  The first retaliatory hit killed the peasant.  Then it happened again:  Different peasant, same tavern.  They killed the fourth spellcasting peasant inside the tavern, where a minotaur ranger was keeping hostage a room full of forty more peasants.  There was a tourmaline set atop a candlestick on the counter.\n\nThey soon made enough checks to figure out that the tourmaline was being used as the component of a Magic Jar spell.  (The imp was shapeshifted into a rat, hidden in a cabinet under the counter, and appeared dead due to not inhabiting its own body.  They didn't know that yet.  So if anyone found it, it was just a yucky, dead rat.  With magic.)\n\nMy intention had been for them to either dispel the Magic Jar spell or free the hostages, then fight the imp and its minotaur henchman normally.  Instead, while the imp's consciousness was back in the crystal because it hadn't yet possessed its next victim, the party's wizard asked, \"What would happen if I put the crystal in my *bag of holding*?\"\n\nI think my face froze for a few seconds.  \"Make a Spellcraft check.\"  It was a very good check.  \"The crystal would be on a different plane of existence, out of range of any potential victims.  It would also be out of range to return to the caster's body, which would die when the spell expired.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" said the wizard, \"I do that.\"\n\nI probably had it coming.  I discarded the imp's character sheet.  With the main battle skipped, they went on to squish the minotaur ranger, loot the imp's corpse, save more townsfolk from the minotaur grunts, learn who had orchestrated the invasion, and eventually discover the Big Bad's influence.",

        "text": "Our group's Fate campaign has just finished, and man, did nobody expect that conclusion.\n\nIt was our group's first attempt to dabble in Fate, and what the group created was basically an odd amalgamation of *Trigun* and *Van Helsing.*\n\nNow, a few important points about the setting. Gold is actually condensed magic, and with enough gold, you can accomplish anything from levitation to lightning guns and pocket dimensions. Every living thing has extra lives. The world is beset by undead demons, and we are trying to find a way to end their assault and save the innocent people.\n\nAnd so we are going all over the place in this world, fighting demons as a small team that consists of:\n\n* expert **demon-hunter priest** who has great prowess with the Holy Word and holy hand grenades;  \n* outstanding **marksman and gunsmith** who is a licensed demon hunter;  \n* very **strong rat person** who can lift everything and anything;  \n* **half-owl, half-human** graduate of the demon-hunting academy who can shoot bullets out of a whip;  \n* master **tinkerer** who has a gold-leaf monkey wrench that can (un)screw *anything*;  \n* and last but not least, a **cannoneer** extraordinaire who loves cannons so much she even stores *everything* in her cannon that has a convenient goldcraft hammerspace.\n\nWe even used a lot of gold and the cannoneer's cannon to create a flying airship (long story). I still cannot believe our gracious GM allowed us to pull this off.\n\nAt one point in the campaign, we suddenly see a **huge** building slowly descend from above the clouds, and we are lured to fly to it using our airship. And of course the huge building is full of demons armed to the teeth and a very powerful archdemon who can shoot lightning. We kill these with some effort, the building starts to lose altitude and crashes somewhere in the vast flatlands, we escape safely in our airship and then notice that building is made of *pure gold.*\n\nAt first we consider commandeering it as our new airship, but then a problem arises: if the demons had one huge flying building made of gold, there is a good chance they have *more than one* and can use them to colony-drop all human settlements out of existence.\n\nOur tinkerer starts looking for a solution and soon discovers a type of wrought iron that is so incredibly mundane and anti-magic, it turns gold into fragile dust on contact.\n\nNow, our cannoneer’s cannon has a hammerspace made possible using gold. Somebody in the group says: \"Well, then you better not use that cannon to shoot those flying buildings. If you drop this metal into the cannon, it will probably create a black hole.\"\n\n*Of course* our tinkerer had to try this out. He asks the cannoneer to create a tiny, centimeter-sized replica of the cannon complete with a teensy goldcraft hammerspace pocket, jury-rigs a device that is supposed to drop a tiny piece of anti-magic metal into the tiny hammerspace cannon after a set period of time, then brings it to an empty flatland many miles away and activates the timer.\n\nYou can probably guess what happens. The experiment worked out perfectly. *Too* perfectly.  \nThe resulting black hole **destroys the world, and everything in it.**\n\nWell, good news: every living thing in the world has extra lives. And *the planet itself* is definitely a living being, isn't it? So the planet quickly pops back into existence several months back on its usual orbit, complete with everyone who still had extra lives.\n\nNow, there are better news: being undead, demons have **NO** extra lives.\n\nThe title of this thread is a direct quote from our GM, who spent several minutes laughing out loud.\n\nThe resulting baby black hole was quickly dealt with as we pawned it off to the Realm of Eternal Precision, which quickly absorbed it for energy. With Hell now empty, the underground caverns are quickly populated and all imprisoned people are safe - all because we accidentally destroyed the world.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/7829nq/battletech_megamek_rookie_mistakes_episode_iv/",
        "text": "If there’s anything you might have divined from my stories thus far, it’s probably that I’m not the most patient man when it comes to Battletech. I want to attack now, I want to move now, I want to be the guy who gets the first hit in by running up and whacking them now. It’s inevitable that I’ll get shot at or hit or what have you, so I might as well start causing trouble first.\n\nWho could blame me, if you saw my record in my first battles? I had the luck of the Devil the first few times I fought. I was lousy about missing shots, so when I was aware that Battlemechs could punch and kick one another, of course I’d go for it. A free attack? Sure, one that probably couldn’t miss quite as readily? Gimme, I needed it.\n\nAnd so, I developed the bad habit of wading into melee with damn near every mech I had. Even the custom VOTOMS ATs I’d created were equipped for melee because duh, the ATs threw gun propellant-driven punches at one another all the time, some had claws, they were all built to close range during assaults and rip targets open in blitz attacks. Hey, it worked, right? I could get into melee range, knock a guy over, then keep stomping a mudhole into them as they blundered into the cycle of pain that was “fall over, try to get back up, fail, fall back down,” hurting themselves while I kept piling on problems with more damage.\n\n“That doesn’t sound so bad,” I hear some of you saying, and it doesn’t, but obviously, every mech is not an Axeman or some other melee-focused mech, and if your favorite tactic can be shut down by anything above “throw rocks at it like an Ewok or something,” you need new tactics. That doesn’t mean I didn’t take advantage of it whenever I could, though. In the fight record between myself and my friend, the winner was always the ground, because I still think that rat bastard gravity did more damage to any of our units than either of us did to one another.\n\nMost of the instances of River City Robots I’d racked up aren’t worth discussing. Seriously, they aren’t. They were just me walking right up to a guy and swinging because I got inordinately pissy at missing with lasers, autocannons, and missiles, and I still hadn’t gotten out of that thought of mech warfare as damage exchanges, so I picked whatever course of action got me as many attacks as I could per-turn. Then began the melee. ...then also began the moment I kind of immediately out myself as a perennial roleplayer because I developed the habit early on of always kicking in mech combat. I can’t tell you why because I’m not sure exactly why. I mean, I say it was a part of roleplaying because your typical Battlemech is not festooned with guns on its legs the way it is on the upper body and arms and I needed to avoid unnecessarily damaging my weapons wherever possible, even though I’m sure it’s not reflected in gameplay at any point, because I still believed myself to be finely-ground crap rather than merely average. The other reason is probably superstition: for some reason, the first time I was in the mech commander’s seat, my kicks landed more often than my punches, and I stuck with kicking dudes the whole way.\n\nThat was how I had some of my early draws as I was being trained. I’d close in at some point and wail on my opponent at melee range, using a kick to knock over another mech and immobilize them for a little while. It’s pretty clear that if I was thinking about it, it could have been a real effective stalling tactic, mostly because I hadn’t heard of the Mech Taser yet and entirely because I had yet to find a situation where Operation Chorus Line had failed me. Well, okay, aside from standing around with my ass in the air just waiting to get flanked and vaporized, and never really doing enough damage to make the melee worthwhile. I dunno, I just hated the idea of being outrun with a weapon I could only use in an environment where I’d just be sacrificing the ability to start the damage exchange first.\n\nA detour to talk about the proud history of melee in Battletech: the old guard, the Inner Sphere, love it, probably for the same reasons I did. Hey, you got limbs, if you’re in close range, why don’t you use them? Hey, that must be like five to twenty tons of limb ready to offload kinetic energy from landing with an almighty BANG, and it might knock a mech on their ass without having to land 20+ damage, so why not? Meanwhile, the outta-towners, the Clans, don’t like it. The Inner Sphere think it’s because they’re pansies, but the Clans know it’s because they don’t like attacks that probably might smash up their own mechs because they lived in an environment of relative scarcity before they began being...Clanny. Like everything else in Clan society, it was a rule of thumb that became ritualized to all holy Hell and back, and that’s why lots of Clan mechs forego hands entirely, seeing melee as mostly worthless and manipulators tipping the weapon arms as dead weight. The Inner Sphere scoffs at this, having basically raised melee to a very clumsy, doofy art form. Swords, axes, spikey fists, claws (which at least one Clan mech has, the Ghost Bear totem mech if I recall, so whatever) and the like show up on IS Battlemechs from time to time with mechs like the Axeman built around carrying a big choppy thing, and one form of melee has its own term in-universe and in gameplay: the Death From Above, also known as the Highlander Burial for the ancient 90-ton assault mech that popularized the move. It involves firing your jump jets to leap into the air and Rider Kick opponents, slamming your mech’s weight into your opponent at Autobahn speeds. Well, because this is Battletech, it’s not so much a Rider Kick as it is “fly into the air, hope you stay upright, and Goombastomp. Also, try to stay upright even if you land a hit.”\n\nThat last one is pivotal to the stupidest thing I ever did, and probably the event that put me off melee for a good long while. This is the tale of customs from my first VOTOMS hack attempt and when I decided to take this to its illogical conclusion. It’s basically the most kicking I ever got done in a skirmish. This was enough kicking that I basically got it all out of my system.\n\nThis one was a skirmish, one where I was experimenting with my MegaMekLab creations. Not just the various attempts at making the canon Scopedogs and stuff, like my mentor’s Scopedog variants, but my high-mobility Partial Wing sky dancer things. These imperfect prototypes I’d made were armed with a Rotary Autocannon and Short Range Missiles to lay down hurt at medium to close range and enough speed and jump jet distance to basically ignore adverse terrain by flying over it. 45-tonners, which puts them at about a light medium weight-wise. Seeing the layout of the map we’d be having a skirmish in, this gnarled canyon with a maze of rivers and big cracklike dry river beds with tall mesas up above, I had a simple plan: hog the high ground.\n\nAt that point I did the stupidest thing I could, which was misread the map during deployment and, instead of immediately grabbing high ground, deploying in the buttcrack of the canyon system, trapping myself down low like an idiot because I mistook the minus signs for marks to separate the elevation level of hexes from other map data. Well I could have jumped up at any time, except my mentor had now freely hogged all the space up above and started plinking away at me while I desperately skated my three high-mobility mechs now robbed of their one real advantage in between the canyon’s many ruts, trying to figure out some way to turn this all around. We traded shots, he blasted away at me, I shot at and missed him a whole bunch, I had armor slowly but surely stolen from me as his shots landed more than mine did and I struggled to reposition. I couldn’t take the good spots because I was trapped in fields of fire. I had to do something, something that would make the enemy clear out so I could get some room to breathe.\n\nWith panic setting in, I decided, fuck it, I’m jumping. I had my three guys target his three guys for a synchronized three-Death From Above attack.\n\nI kind of wish I could have been in the heads of those pilots I’d singled out while I went for it. As if it was planned and practiced numerous times, three mechs suddenly burst out of the canyons in unison, spreading wings like eagles in the sky before swooping down on their prey. Must have been one hell of a sight.\n\n...the punchline is that according to my brick-stupid “take an AT’s weight in VOTOMS and multiply it by ten to get Battlemech weight” system, the venerable Scopedog was the equivalent of a 75-ton heavy mech, and I was trying to attack three of them with 45-tonners using a technique built for mechs twice their size. There was only one way this could possibly turn out…\n\n...which was that it worked! From a certain point of view. I mean, I’d gotten them to move, hadn’t I?\n\nFirst, the bad news. Mechs littered the ground. For a while there were only two kinds of state a Battlemech was in, which was knocked the hell over or knocked the hell out. And by “knocked the hell out” I mean the pilot was unconscious, opening them up to called shots to shoot out parts individually and such. That wasn’t much of a problem for either of us, because we were all sprawled around trying to stand after I did the equivalent of grabbing a handful of minis and throwing them full speed at the other side of the table and watching as pieces went everywhere like skittles. See, that’s why it’s good this was being done over Megamek and not with actual miniatures. Being that stupid with physical objects would’ve gotten a little expensive, what with the score now standing at us having a couple mechs apiece, either immobilized or straight up dead. Call that one and a half mechs each, some damaged from fire beforehand and others from the 135-ton three-pack of good decisions I’d just dropped from the sky. I lost a mech from that attack and a subsequent attempt to get it back to its feet! You wanna talk backfiring, that’s a huge backfire right there.\n\nThe good news was that I’d sort of leveled the playing field that way. Up until that point I was sure I’d lose a mech, which I did, one of the ones that missed their attack as I recall, but I’d instakilled one, sort of. See, I wasn’t aware that kicking or otherwise shoving a mech off the map meant it retreated and, I guess, didn’t come back. That remains the first and only time I ever earned a kill via Super Smash Bros, and I don’t fancy my luck trying that crazy move twice. All in all, it was probably the luckiest break I had. \n\nAs I recall, that battle ended in a draw, too. Everything was too wrecked to seriously do any damage to the other side, and if we kept playing it would have turned into a race to see who did less falling damage to themselves trying to get back up or lazily wade into range to try to kick one another to death with our sole working legs. We’d done so much damage to one another, as usual that if it was called a victory, it was gonna be pretty damn Pyrrhic.\n\nI’d lost my taste for melee in that encounter. It’d just become too risky to pursue with mechs I’d built that just weren’t designed for it. I did a lot better if I was just allowed to stay disciplined and patient and wear down my opponent with fast maneuvers and harassment from range. That’s exactly what I did in the test skirmish that perfected the Tonbogiri, which went my way and cemented the jump jet flyer as my signature mech type. I dunno if I’d ever go back to seriously trading on melee again - maybe do some builds sometime? Guess someone just has to get close enough to find out...",

        "text": "* [&lt;&lt; previous](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/778dr1/vtm_jalees_kamal_villain_by_proxy_part_13/)\n\nWelcome to the end of the ride. Please keep your hands and feet inside the car at all times.\n\nLady ST started off the next game with: “The city is under siege from the Sabbat.” She has this way of using just a few words to command complete attention. I had changed my place at the table, shifting closer to Lady ST, and away from the other players. They looked at me with a range of emotions, and I calmly smiled back. Lady ST took a few minutes to describe the current state of the Domain.\n\nThe Domain had been overrun with Sabbat, seemingly in a single night. Where there was once a bustling nightlife there was now egregious breaches of Masquerade. Where the feeding grounds were once plentiful and safe, a quarter of the Domain was missing after feeding earlier that night. There were confirmed sightings of at least fifty Sabbat, and suspicions that there were more like a full hundred of them lurking in the night. The rest of the Domain had gathered in the secondary Elysium, one of the larger banks’ satellite site at the outskirts of town. The Prince and the other Primogen had met, and had come into the Elysium with concerned looks on their faces.\n\n&gt;Prince: “Alright, alright. Everyone calm down and take your seats. I know that this raid is a surprise, and has caught a lot of us off guard, but we have driven them back before, and we can do so again. King and friends have arranged for a delivery of blood tonight, so we should be able to get everyone fed and ready at least for the next few nights.”  \n&gt;P: “Now, we need to begin to mount an offensive to counter the-”  \n&gt;Edvin raises his hand  \n&gt;P: “to counter the gross misconduct of the Sabbat in the area. Once I’m done speaking we’ll begin to-”  \n&gt;Edvin waves his hand back and forth  \n&gt;P: “begin to assign you all to groups based on your areas of expertise. The Primogen will come around to-”  \n&gt;Edvin stands up, still waving his hand  \n&gt;P: “to hand out details and arrange armaments. *Yes, Edvin*.”  \n&gt;E: “Prince Santino, I did not receive a call to attend a Primogen meeting.”  \n\nThat got some whispers started.\n\n&gt;E: “If I had, I could have informed you more privately to not count on any help from the Anarchs in this matter. As you can see-”, arm sweep, “none are here tonight. I have been informed that the Anarch free state have converted to the Sabbat, and encourage all of us to do the same.”\n\nThis is the point at which the Prince lost control of Elysium. I got a lot of looks from the other players. Fortunately, I didn’t get assaulted with questions, as Lady ST went right back to the Prince.\n\n&gt;P: “The Anarchs did WHAT?”  \n&gt;Nosferatu Primogen: “Sire, the Anarchs know that this is our fallback Elysium. I suggest we begin to disperse immediately to the tertiary-”  \n&gt;P: “Yes, everyone gather in groups of 2 or 3 and head to this address!”  \n&gt;Edvin: “I don’t think it’ll matter. I’m pretty sure that’s them now.”  \n&gt;P: “Who now?”  \n&gt;E: “The front door is about to be torn from its setting. I suggest everyone funnel out the emergency exits in the rear of the building. I’ll do my best to hold the Sabbat off.”  \n&gt;King: “You’re the one who led them here in the first place, aren’t you?”  \n&gt;E: “I’m appalled that you would think that of me. I’m no more a member of the Sabbat than you are.”  \n&gt;P: “Drop it, King. Let’s get everyone to safety, and then we can get to the bottom of it all.”  \n\nAnd so, the Domain filed out into the night via the rear of the building, while Edvin went out front to meet the Sabbat attackers. He had a nice, if unproductive, chat with Jalees and a few members of his column, and then returned to the coterie’s haven. He left a note to the rest of the coterie, indicating that he was saddened that he didn’t think that any of them were ready for the morality shift of the Sabbat, and so didn’t attempt to recruit them, or were they ready for the intense loneliness and uncertainty of the Inconnu, and didn’t invite them along his journey. Edvin gathered his things, put them into the moving truck that had been left for him, and quietly left the city. This was all worked out beforehand with Lady ST, so I just passed her the note to indicate this part of the plan, made a couple of unnecessary dice rolls, and then changed sheets.\n\nAnd I made a big damn show of changing my character sheet.\n\nLady ST then took the players through the city as a group, running from Sabbat jumping out at them left, right, above and below. It was a harrowing chase, taking them from the west side of the city to the far south, almost outside of the city itself. They fought, snuck, ran, hid and all manner of plans were conceived, actioned and abandoned. After almost two hours of travel they finally made it to the third Elysium. They congratulated themselves, and looked around for the others. They found the others standing outside of the building, watching with varying looks on their faces. Looks of anguish, defeat, resignation and fear. Many, many kinds of fear.\n\nThe third Elysium was on fire, and had been for quite some time.\n\nThe fire department had been called almost three hours earlier to the site, and had determined that the fire was of  such size that there was nothing that they could do to quell the fire without great risk to themselves. The safe and smart play was to control the spread of the fire and protect the surrounding buildings. They had already ruled it a possible arson, for a variety of factors, but mostly for the color of the flames.\n\nEveryone, say it with me now: “GREEN FLAME!”\n\nThe Prince was slow to get control of the situation again, but he began to go around to all of the members and see who had a place that was both secure enough and large enough to fit the almost 300 Camarilla members inside of comfortable, and with enough space and supplies to defend it. He canvassed a majority of the members before he got to the player’s coterie. The players had a couple of spaces, King’s being the most suited, but they all agreed that it was Edvin who had the greatest chance of having such a fortress to fall back to. The Prince agreed, and shared that he hadn’t seen Edvin since they left him to fight of the Sabbat. No one had.\n\nThe other players looked at me again. I confirmed that no, Edvin was not at the site of the third Elysium, and no, none of their phone calls were going through. In fact, all of their phones gave the ‘This number is no longer in service’ message when they attempted to call him. All of his text-only numbers and email addresses bounced as well, his online profiles deleted and even the few websites that he ran privately were gone. Edvin had disappeared as if he had never existed. I got really, really strange looks from the players.\n\n&gt;King: “Well, now what do we do? I don’t think we’ll be able to go to ground anywhere for the night, not if Edvin was feeding them information.”  \n&gt;Thea: “What makes you think that he was?”  \n&gt;The boys all look at each other  \n&gt;Brain: “Well, to understand that, you need to understand everything else that we learned about Jalees.”  \n\nAnd they explained everything. They explained all of Edvin’s manufactured stories, and all of the half-truths that they were based on. They detailed everything they could find out about Edvin, up to and including some of the private things in his Tremere file. His repeated attempts to leave the Tremere clan, his excellence at all things Thaumiturgical, his natural ability of being forgiven time after time and time again. His specific connection with Tremere, and how that could be influencing the Tremere around him, how all of the Tremere that cleared out of the Domain before his arrival had all been reassigned elsewhere the week before. Lady ST helped them out with the particulars, but they managed to cover a good 80-85% of Edvin’s backstory, with a little bit of cautious assumption. \n\nI told them as much.\n\n&gt;John: “So where is Edvin?”  \n&gt;Me: “You’ll find him. Keep looking.”  \n\nThe Primogen council got together and made a snap decision to move back to the primary Elysium, if only to get out of the street and to a somewhat defensible position. Many were against the idea, not least because it was the ideal place to lay a trap for any returning members. The Prince agreed, but decided that even the Sabbat could scarcely take all 300 members at the same time. He ordered the move, and those assembled slowly filtered back out into the night. In groups of 4-7 the Camarilla of the Domain made their way to Elysium, and none fell on their way. None were even harassed, or looked at oddly.\n\nThe 300 members of the Domain finally made it to Elysium, and all of them roughly around the same time. The lights were dark as they approached, but everything seemed in order as the Prince led the way into past the security guards and into the building. The Primogen Council came in not far behind him, and then the rest appeared in small batches and hurried inside. Everyone was riding high on paranoia and fear, exacerbated by their unassailed return to Elysium. The players were concerned, but went inside anyways.\n\nThe main hall looked as it ever did, and a few servants were tidying the place, dusting off tables and setting up chairs. One of them, the Prince’s main ghoul, came over to the Prince.\n\n&gt;Ghoul: “Ah, Prince, you are slightly earlier than anticipated. Preparations will be ready in just a moment.”  \n&gt;Prince: “What do you mean by ‘anticipated’?”  \n&gt;G: “Well, the nice man up on the dias told us that Elysium would be starting within the hour, but that was only a half hour ago.”  \n&gt;P: “What man on the dias?”  \n&gt;G: “Oh, that’s odd, I could have sworn he was up there just a moment ago…”  \n\nThe Prince and the Primogen stormed up to the dias and began to look around. After a little while of turning up nothing, I spoke up: “Good evening, everyone.” Everyone turned to look at the voice, and found a medium height, olive skinned man wearing a bespoke dark charcoal suit, features unhelpful in determining his origins.\n\n&gt;P: “Who the hell are you?”  \n&gt;Me: “I am here to invite you to join the Sabbat.”  \n&gt;P: “Then you can fuck off right back to where you came from. No one here’s interested in joining your cult!”  \n&gt;Me: “How unfortunate. I was hoping to convert more of you, after the great success we had with your Anarchs.”  \n&gt;Brujah Primo: “Those traitorous scum! After all we gave to them these past few months.”  \n&gt;Me: “Tsk, tsk. Name calling is uncalled for. They joined of their own free will, after hearing all about the membership.”  \n&gt;Ventrue Primo: “I seriously doubt that.”  \n&gt;Me: “That’s perfectly fine. Everyone has five minutes to make a decision.”  \n&gt;Thea: “What’s the choice again?”  \n&gt;Me: “The same pitch as always: Join or Die. Anyone wishing to join may step over here, behind me.”  \n\nThe Domain began to chitter amongst itself chaotically. Voice rose and fell in rollercoaster fury, several groups fighting amongst themselves, and amongst each other, about the value of unlife vs the horrors of the Sabbat. There were a few questions asked to the man in the suit, with no response. This caused even more frenetic whispering. He gave a warning at sixty seconds, and another at twenty. His face was calm as he counted down the last five seconds.\n\nIn total, none of the Domain went to his side.\n\n&gt;Me: “What a disappointment. I was hoping to salvage at least a 20% recruitement rating, especially after disposing of that loafing oaf.”  \n&gt;Prince: “Which oaf would that be?”  \n&gt;Me: “Well, adieu, Domain. This is your final night.”  \n\nThe man in the suit disappeared, and all of the doors were shut and locked. One by one, the doors were lit on fire - regular fire - and hot smoke and ash began to fill the room. Thankfully for those inside, the ceiling was rather high, so it would take some time for the smoke to begin to impair them. Unfortunately, there were no windows in the main room, not even skylights, and so there was no easy exit to get everyone through. Various members tried to find alternate escape routes, but none were successful. All of the normal escapes were carefully, professionally foiled in some way.\n\nLady ST put an hourglass on the table, waited a beat, and then flipped it over. Ten minutes.\n\nA few members resorted to simply opening large holes into the parts of the wall that hadn’t caught on fire yet, and charging out into one of the surrounding rooms. Screams echoed from those holes, and none were too eager to follow behind those first few. The fire began to close in around the room, filling the walls with bright, aggravating heat. A few members fell prey to their fear, and dove through the nearest exit regardless of what await on the other side. Those inside were slowly forced back, forced together in the middle of the large space. The walls began to creak and crack, threatening to collapse.\n\nThe players began to sweat, and sweat hard. The walls were about to give way, the roof was threatening to come down, and no one was coming up with any options to escape. They all looked at each other and babbled, coming up with ideas and shooting them down without much investigation. I had planned the trap fairly well, but I had made sure to leave a few obvious - what I thought to be obvious - holes in the plan that they could exploit. \n\nThe Sabbat in the outer rooms could only handle so many at a time, so herding everyone out the same exit would be a good way to get out, though you would need to sacrifice a few. The walls were set on fire, so opening a hole in the roof would allow for those with high potency to throw others out, and then jump out themselves if they were quick enough about it. Downward was also largely undefended, but any real amount of potence would be able to break through rather quickly.\n\nThe players considered all of these, except downward, and dismissed them out of hand. They were convinced that there was no way out. The players started to complain about the time limit, they started to complain about me, and how I had tricked them. Lady ST simply said “you do not have time to not focus on the game. We can discuss out of game concerns after game.” I passed Thea a note: “Thea receives a text: ‘There is always a solution to the problem at hand. Assumptions should be tested.’”\n\nThe players had another round of questions for Lady ST, and finally decided that the most direct way out was through, and started to convince the others that the best course of action was to have everyone run through one exit as fast as they could, and do their best not to get caught by the Sabbat. The others were nervous, but eventually they were able to convince the Prince and get everyone massed up towards their chosen door. They waited until everyone was in position, took a last look around them, and then…\n\nRan out the other direction.\n\nIt was a great fake out, and it absolutely worked. The Sabbat members, seeing them begin to mass in one direction, shifted the majority of their forces in that direction, leaving the surrounding net rather thin. As they turned and began to run, the Sabbat howled in anger at the trick, and charged around - and some through - the room to chase them. The majority made it to the other side, but a solid sixth of the Domain were lost in the charge. Another sixth were lost to the anti-personnel mines that had been arranged at the perimeter of the building. Their escape from the building complete, the remainder of the Domain split up for the night, and went their separate ways in groups of twenty or so. They searched for a safe haven for the day, and for a reliable blood supply for the inevitable counter offensive.\n\nThe Sabbat let them leave for the night, content that their spies would follow them to where they slept and have their mortal agents finish the job during the day. The Domain’s security was well maintained, however, and they only got a scant few. The next night fell, and the Sabbat had claimed both the former Anarch territory and a large section of territory on the opposite side of the city. The entire city was now caught between two fronts of Sabbat, and had a whole new problem to deal with.\n\nLady ST closed game, and I made my farewells. The other players were both angry and ecstatic about my move, and asked to have me fill them in on the whole story. I told them that they would have to seek that particular knowledge from Lady ST. I kept in contact with Dilton and Sabrina, the past year or so, and they have been having a blast trying to win back the city from the Sabbat. They still haven’t gotten all of the information they need to piece together some of the more obscure things from the game, especially about who the man in the suit is and how he and Edvin had arranged things, but they know around 95% of the story now. The group was doing too well for me to feel confident in killing off any of the PCs, so I settled for massive damage to the NPCs of the Domain.\n\nI think they’re down to about 85 total, having gone through three Princes - the original, one, two, and now they’re on their third replacement.\n",

        "text": "I've been running and playing one-offs and short (4-6) session campaigns, mostly on Roll20, since losing my regular group a few months ago after moving, and for the most part, everything has been going well enough.\n\nLast night didn't go quite so well. It was the end of a 4-session homebrewed campaign. It was a low-magic setting (with no dedicated casters in the group), and the players' task was to stop a demon from opening a portal to let more demons through.\n\nThe group consisted of a dwarven warrior (played for 3 years, RL friend with the rogue), human rogue (3 years, RL friend with the warrior), half-orc barbarian (1 year), and a human ranger (10+ years).\n\nAll things said, it was a pretty standard mini-investigation / dungeon-crawl game up until the final battle.\n\nAt the very end of the game, the players made a decision I think I've only ever had true newbies make in the past.\n\nIn the last room before the BBEG, the party faced a handful of mooks. They weren't too dangerous, as the intent was to build suspense, not to challenge. Throughout the fight, I gave bits of narration about chanting coming from the next room, how the chanting was crescendoing, and as it did, increasing amounts of infernal light could be seen seeping in around the door.\n\nIt was meant to build up suspense and let them have an \"in the nick of time\" moment. I didn't plan on having the demon finish during this battle, but I *did* kept careful track of time through it, but only to play with the \"urgency\" of the situation and make it feel as if the battle was against the clock instead of the mooks.\n\nWhen the battle with the mooks finished, none of the party had anything more than scratches. Despite this, the barbarian (our newest player) spoke up:\n\n&gt; I think we should take a short rest, just to be safe.\n\nThis catches me off-guard, but them being a newer player, I can accept that they make strange decisions at times. I was about to point out the urgency of the situation to let him know it was a bad idea, when the other three players, including our 10-year-vet^\\* , agree. I'm struck dumb for a moment.\n\nCatching myself, I sum up the current situation: They're sitting outside the BBEG's door where they can hear its chanting, they know that the BBEG is trying to open a portal to let through more demons, they know the process is nearly complete, and despite all of this, they want to sit down for an hour?\n\nAll four players answer in the affirmative.\n\nI ask for a second confirmation after pointing out that there's no way the demon *doesn't* know they're there, and if it finishes the portal while they're resting and attacks (and point out that there's no way it wouldn't), they're going to be starting the battle without any of the advantages of a short rest, but all of the *dis*advantages of being caught while resting.\n\nTo which our warrior, who had played for a few years, replied,\n\n&gt; It's a game. Nothing's going to happen until we're ready.\n\nI'm shocked. I ask one final time if they're sure they want to do this, and openly state that I think it's a terrible idea. Despite this, everyone agrees.\n\nThey didn't get their short rest. Five minutes into it, the demon bursts through the doors, joined by several other demons, and the \"final\" battle is on.\n\nOriginally, the final battle was going to be against the demon and a horde of undead, with the undead whittling down the party while the demon ignored the players while attempting to finish the portal. The demon would need several more minutes of concentration, with each interruption of concentration adding a bit of time to the task.\n\nThe demon would have been fully focused on the portal. It would have required the demon to maintain concentration, with a narration showing the effects of said concentration. The intention was that the ranger or rogue could take occasional pot-shots against it to stall for time until the party could engage the demon fully and it would be forced to abandon the portal to respond.\n\nAt least, that was the plan. You know what they say about making plans for adventurers, I'm sure.\n\nNow, instead of a horde of undead, I have the demon supported by a handful of other demons. They're weaker than the main demon, but still stronger than the original undead, even with fewer numbers. The warrior, barbarian, and rogue were none too pleased with this (even after I point out that I asked them *three times* while pointing out that it was a terrible idea).\n\nI was nicer to them than I probably should have been, but I generally try to avoid a TPKO without having a damned good reason for it (*total party brain failure* being one such reason). Even so, I didn't exactly go easy on them, either.\n\nThey're ultimately victorious, but the warrior is dead, while the barbarian and rogue are in bad shape. Only the ranger isn't struggling (I could learn a few things about positioning from him). The three survivors enter the final room to deal with the portal (thankfully nobody suggested another rest), and are met with the originally-planned horde of undead.\n\nTo be fair to them, I *did* reduce the size and strength of the horde, though I was greatly debating on not doing so. Again, I usually try to avoid a TPKO, and the survivors were already in tough shape, but this was an unusual circumstance. It was only through a few lucky rolls from the ranger that the barbarian and rogue both survived this final fight.\n\nThey defeat the undead, destroy the portal, and after the game was finished, the warrior, the three-year player who made the comment about how \"nothing's going to happen\" sends me a private message saying that I cheated and used cheap tricks against them, and declared that he and his friend would never play in one of my games again.\n\nOh, well.\n\n---\n\n\\* The ranger, the 10+-year vet, only went along with the idea because of how silly it was. I have no doubts about this, even if he didn't say so. Among other hints, he was always the last person to respond to the requests for confirmation, his responses were always a simple \"yes\" that had an \"I'm struggling not to laugh\" tone to them, and said nothing when the other three complained about the short rest being interrupted.\n\nAs well, prior to this, he had been an offensive player (play-style, not personality). In contrast to this, in the battle against the demon and undead, he acted in a much more supportive manner. It's honestly because of him that the party survived at all. For the other three, it felt like they were entirely certain that a short rest at the BBEG's door was a great idea.",

        "text": "Just like last week, our party was down two members. One guy was in Florida and the other was still experiencing computer issues. \n\n**The Party:**\n\nLuvLock the NN Warlock - The know-it-all. Dislikes it when I make rules apply to him or call him out on his metagaming. He’s being slowly taken over by some Cthulu-esque dark god. “Luv” references H. P. Lovecraft. “Lock” is because he’s a warlock.\n\nMidir the NN Gladiator- He finally made a character sheet and was ready to play. I’m eager to see him play up the performer aspect of his character. I’m probably going to have him change his alignment, because he was playing more a NG character.\n\nDamien the LG Paladin - Serves Helm and is the moral compass of the party. Currently his job is tanking any damage, making Perception checks, and keeping the party from stealing things. Definitely the party leader on account of being competent *and* smart.\n\nSir Elvenbeard the Vast the CN Pirate - He was in Florida this week. Probably wanted to get closer to the water.\n\nNo-name the LG Cleric - No-name has had computer issues these past two weeks but is planning on buying a used PC from a friend. I took control of his character this week to offer healing to the rest of the party. Other than that, he took a passive role.\n\nLast week the party was attacked by an animated suit of armor. They defeated it, only taking minimal damage, and resumed their investigation of the abandoned house. I should note that except for a couple isolated instances, the no one was actually rolling to search. They’d go in a room, I’d give them a description, and they’d move on. Eventually, they ran out of house and still hadn’t found a way down into the basement. So they went outside and started questioning the children. Well, I say questioning. It was more like interrogating. The children answered a few questions before the party scared them and they started crying. Real smooth, guys. At this point a heavy mist starts surrounding the house and the characters retreat inside to actually search the place.\n\nThe first thing they noticed is that the wood paneling inside the house is actually decorated with skulls, monsters, and generally scary things. This added a layer of ominousness to the rest of their search. The cute figurines on the mantle are actually skeletons. They feel unseen eyes watching them. Spooky. They also managed to find a couple secret rooms. One contained a skeleton clutching a letter written by someone named Strahd. Who could this be? The letter mentions rituals and sacrifices, so Strahd can’t be a good guy. The other room has stairs that go up to the attic. \n\nThey searched the attic and found a locked room that contained the skeletons and ghosts of the two children they met outside. The children are pleasant enough and when asked, give the party information on how to reach the basement. They older of the two, a girl named Rose, points to a location on a dollhouse that looks eerily similar to the house they are in. The Paladin takes this to mean that the way to the basement can be found in a room down the hall. The Gladiator takes this to mean that the way to the basement is in the dollhouse. No, it wasn’t a Zoolander reference. The player actually thought this. Strangely the ghosts seem unaware that the party had met them before. The ghosts claim that they are confined to this room. As the party left the room, the two ghosts begged them not to leave. But the party left anyway. So the ghosts rushed forward and possessed two of the party members - the Gladiator and the Warlock. They tried to roll Intimidation to drive off the ghosts but failed horribly, leading to whining from the Warlock. Why do these things always happen to him? (They don’t) He didn’t even go into the room. (He did) His Elven resistance to charms and sleep should apply to ghostly possession (It shouldn’t) His semi possession by a dark god should make him immune to other things possessing him (Sigh) Eventually the Paladin stepped in and convinced the ghosts to leave, promising that the party would lay their spirits to rest. With that done, the Paladin left the Gladiator and the Warlock investigating the dollhouse to open up the secret door to the stairs that led down to the basement.\n\nAnd with that it was time to end for the night. Next week there should be more combat and hopefully the entire party will be there. They probably won’t be, but at least no one will be in Florida and our Cleric should have a new computer.\n",

        "text": "&gt;The cast of misfits:\n\n**Arcturus Harric** - Senior Techpriest in service of the Ordo Haereticus. Only one to survive from the original squad and operates under the assumption that those sentient servitors his inquisitor pairs him up with are there to fetch things and catch bullets. Screeches at people in binary whenever he's about to lose an argument. 1001110110000110 \n\n**Valeria Cawl** - Sister of battle who wears the moniker of bolter bitch with pride. Survived two assignments and now wields custom crafted full-auto bolter pistols. Once got into a shouting match with a space wolf, rolled for intimidation and made the Astrates back down by being scarier than a genetically enhanced space viking killing machine. Also, has a dark family secret and yells at people who try to figure it out.\n\n**Ulam Dran** - Psyker shaman from a tribe of cave men. Was selected by the gods of battle to serve the overfather Emprah. Actually the smartest guy around and quickly adapted many of the wonders of technology. Still prefers to hunt small rodents and grill them over the open fire over going to the ships cafeteria for food though. Acts stupid to mess with people.\n\n**Percival** - Space Marine reject who somehow ended up on a rouge trader vessel and became the local master at arms. Then got gobbled up by the current inquisitor when the rogue trader got blammed for heretical acts and his crew got assimilated. Badass cqc specialist who uses a las carbine and a chainaxe with shocking efficiency.\n\n&gt;The job at hand\n\nCaptain Paranoia (aka the inquisitor) intercepted a vox communiqué from the second planet of the system they were currently refueling in. It was about a dastardly daemonic deed that was was supposed to be performed on the day of the local praise-the-emperor-festivity and spoke about sacrificing the souls of the loyal citizens on the height of their revelry to fuel Glabreklicksclubssomethingwhatnot. After burning through five astropaths who all shat themselves to death upon hearing the name, Captain Paranoia managed to have a chat with his colleagues from the Ordo Malleus and confirmed that this guy must be some Slaaneshi big shot daemon. \n\nChecking his calendar, he also found out that the main event of the festivities was coming up in 5 days, so - with a sigh of defeat - he accepted the lot of handling that situation and sent his... bestish... men to whack people over the head until they found the cult leader while he did the important cogitator work from aboard his vessel (wich pretty much amounted to sifting through the local internet forums and looking for posts saying Chaos rulez!!11 and drinking recaff. He was not exactly the emperors finest...)\n\n&gt;The a-team goes at it\n\nAfter about thirty minutes of scribbling and asking questions to a ever more strained astropath on the nature of their foe, the gang packed their stuff and boarded their shuttle, ready to purge some heretics. Valerie was playing with her bolters, Ulam was  eating something disgusting and Percival was screaming at Arcturus to stop humming children's songs in binary, which the arrogant heap of cogs and tubes ignored. \n\nThey landed on a rather pleasant day, on the private landing pad of the planetary governors estate, and walked into the massive, totally-not-compensating-for-something building. They were greeted with the most impressive, most majestic display of imperial art and architecture they had ever seen. The high, marble walls were lined with gold display of imperial iconography - skulls and such - and paintings of unmatched quality showed scenes of piousness and pride. A subtle music began playing as the gang walked along the long corridor that could - judging by the splendor and grandiose artistry - be taken straight from the imperial palace itself. The music started subtle, just out of the range of human hearing but loud enough to be subconsciously noticed and slowly swelled to a beautiful, bombastic orchestra that brought tears to the eyes of Valerie and Percival. Intricate machinery made the light itself dance upon the walls, showering them in a million colors and captivating the techpriest with its elegant complexity.\n\nThe a man, clothed in rich robes and scented with the finest perfume imaginable stepped forth to meet them, bowing graciously to the agents of the holy inquisition. He introduced himself as governor Soandso and expressed how tremendously honored he felt to assist them in their good work. He had prepared his finest guest apartments for them and invited them to join him at his table to talk about the matters at hand and to enjoy the finest foods his world had to offer.\n\nValerie and Percival thanked him for his hospitality and cooperation - after the last grueling jobs they were more than looking forward to having a base of operations that was not a hovel on a deathworld or a half-empty cargo container on a space hulk. Arcturus was still oiling his pants at the sight of the simple yet beautifully complex machinery, and Ulam pulled his Las pistol and shot the governor.\n\nWait, what?\n\nEverybody was in total shock and I had utterly lost my flow. \n\n\"Ya see...\", his player explained. \"I rolled on whether or not my character came to this conclusion.\"\n\n (he had. It wasn't out of the ordinary for this player to roll for his characters decisions whenever he was treading on the fine line  between meta and ingame knowledge)\n\nHe looks at me. \"You've spent the last ten minutes going into detail how everything is mind blowing beautiful and overwhelming. Slaanesh is the god of excess. You describe this guy as a hedonist. Hedonistic aristocrats are Slaaneshs , as we learned from the Ordo Malleus guy. He's being nice to us, no one in your games is ever nice. So I pull out my gun and shoot him, then, while everyone is wtfing, I search his corpse.\"\n\n(there were a few more things he I mentioned, but I'm cutting it short here)\n\nI take of my glasses and wipe the panic-sweat of my face. I take a sip of beer and think about how to salvage this disaster: After all, the fucker had just killed my fucking slaaneshi sorcerer. \n\n\"The man is far to stunned to react as you wordlessly burn a fistsized hole trough his skull. Your companions gape in shock as you casually walk over to the corpse and rummage through his cloak, finding a purple amulet with the blasphemous symbol of Slaanesh on it, hanging around his neck. Now take your Xp and and go suck off an ork.\" \n\nAnd so it was, that, for the first time in history, a player actually paid attention to the hints I drop. Usually they are as dimwitted as lobotomized gretchens when it comes to deducting and maybe I got cocky, but this time they (or he) sherlocked the shit out of my quest and I couldn't even be mad about it...\n\nWas it a little that guyish? Yhea... If he had been wrong, he would have hendersoned the whole campaign. \n\nBut he wasn't. He listened and recognized the given clues as clues. Then he put them together and solved what was supposed to be a race against time to stop a massive murderfuck in, like, ten in-universe minutes. The campaign then turned into the PCs going full on whitchhunter, appropriating personnel through liberal abuse of power and basically going full on Gestapo on the cultists, rooting them out in a single, bloody session.\n\nAll because of one motherfucking caveman...",

        "text": "So I just finished a Dark Heresy campaign with what is undoubtedly the best tank character I've ever played: The Songfather's Glorious Will. \n\nFor those of you unfamiliar with Dark Heresy, its a game set in the Warhammer 40k universe. Like all 40k RPGs, it's focus is to slowly wear down a character's sanity and resolve until the grim reality of the universe sets in. This was not the case for Will. He was a hulking mountain of a man, skilled in both paperwork and melee combat. Between his first session and the end of the game, he never suffered a single insanity point, corruption point, or disabling wound. Will was a stone, immutable and unyielding. His exploits included:\n\n\n\n-surviving on an ork infested world with only primitive weapons and armor. \n\n-escaping from the intern pits of the Adeptus Administratum\n\n-singlehandedly slaying a giant burrowing worm\n\n-walking away from a fight with three slaanesh daemons\n\n-walking into lasfire, and taking zero damage\n\n-having the same lasgun thrown at him in frustration, and taking zero damage\n\n-holding an ancient Eldar psychic artifact without gaining corruption\n\n-getting into a fight with a blast door, underwater, and winning\n\n-returning to said underwater hell to save a party member that had been left for dead\n\n-defeating a khorne empowered mutant in close combat (with some help), and taking zero damage\n\n-assaulting an entrenched firing line by running at it, and succeeding\n\nThen just when it seemed nothing would stop him, the party's transport shuttle was shot down and Will was sucked out. The party mourned for him because he had, at last, found a foe he could not defeat. Gravity. \n\n\n\n... at least until he rejoined them at the crash site, battered, beaten, but alive. \n\n\n\n\nThanks for reading! I can go into more detail in the comments if you guys want, just felt like explaining each of these would lead to a post that was WAY too long. \n\n",

My character is a tiefling variant (winged) cleric, my back up characters are her four older siblings.  This was my first time starting a campaign at level one, so I was very prepared for her to die early on and didn't put much thought into her at first, until she acquired a sentient weapon our first session and things spiraled from there.

I ended up writing mine and their journey to the ruins of Bael Turath, once the city of tieflings, to help me flesh out the characters in my head as well as finalize the details of their backstory and figure out how a bar fighting tiefling became a cleric of Selune.

        "text": "So, I used to run this D&amp;D campaign in Uni. And I felt the party could use a few more members, so I set-up a short side game for some of my player's friends, with the intent of transplanting the ones I liked into the main game.\n\nI had:\n\n* Two players from the main game, I wanted a few people with actual experience with my games to help guide the newer ones. They played a Dwarven Cleric and a Dragonborn Fighter, but I had the Fighter start out with a Redshirt to establish that characters could die for the new players.\n\n* The first of the new players, one of my players' roommates. She was Seneca, came from a reservation. Notable Facial Scars, from a feral dog I think.  She played a male Goliath Barbarian. \n\n* The second was a workplace buddy of the Dwarven Cleric. Decent bloke all around. Played a Tiefling Rogue.\n\n* The third was that guy. He'd played before with one of my players, and apparently they thought they'd hit him up for this little recruitment game. This turned out to be a mistake. He played a half-elf wizard that was blatantly an idealized version of himself.\n\nSo, I had them run through a Dungeon. Really basic dungeon, just to see how everyone played. It was a Kobold Dungeon, with minor influence from Tucker's Kobolds. After the first combat encounter I had a scripted event occur in which the Redshirt fighter would get swept away by a water trap. I then had the player's meet the actual character, the Dragonborn Fighter, in the Kobold jail cells. \n\nAnyways, lots of traps and lots of fighting cheating kobolds. I think most of the players were having a good time, but That Guy was being creepy. He was staring at the Barbarian's player. It was a warning sign I didn't pick up on until after the fact. I would later learn that That Guy was a self described \"Incel\". This venture was doomed from the start. \n\nAnyways, beat dungeon, killed the boss of the Kobolds, and return to town. The Dragonborn fighter went to the blacksmith, the Cleric went to prepare his spells, Rogue went to chat up the bartender, and the Barbarian went to go get a drink. \n\nAnd then That Guy ruined my game.\n\n-----\n\nNot only was That Guy an Incel, he was an Incel with a Transformation fetish, specifically one of Men into Women. There are certain internet subcultures, notably Deviantart, that let this sort of thing fester, and I have every reason to believe that That Guy was an avid consumer of creepy internet fetish drawings.\n\nAnd he let that bleed into the game. He cast Polymorph on the Goliath Barbarian, and said something along the lines of \"I turn [The Barbarian] into a Human Chick\".\n\nI like to think of myself as a quick witted DM with strong improv skills but I had no idea how to react to this. I started looking up whether he could even do that and I stopped narrating the game, when really I should just have said \"No, you can't do that\". I think it stunned the Barbarian's player too, she didn't roll for her Wis. check. But That Guy said he rolled for her, and rolled low. That combined with the Barbarian's low wisdom score meant that in the mind of That Guy, he had succeeded.\n\nI hadn't commented yet. I was fucking shocked, and I think part of that was how That Guy was acting like he was the DM now. He acted like he was in charge. He acted like his rolls had succeeded, and then he said \"I cast Suggestion, Barbarian wants to go up to my rented room and have sex\".\n\nSo That Guy tried to:\n\n1. Pull shit I would not have allowed by doing it faster than I could respond and react to.\n\n2. Alter the appearance of another player's character.\n\n3. Magically Rape another player's character.\n\nEven one of those things would make me at the very least punish him, all three in quick succession was an immediate kick out. And frankly there was no way we could continue the game. A moment like that just brought everything to a halt and sours everything that could come before or after.\n\nI don't know why That Guy did what he did. Maybe he was trying teach the Barbarian's player a lesson about some perceived slight against him. Maybe he was trying to hit on her in some fucking horrible way. I don't know, and I don't really care. We kicked him out of the group and I have no idea what happened to him.\n\nI have no idea how the Barbarian's player reacted. I don't know much about her life before University but I know she came from a really rough reservation, and there's a very real chance That Guy had just smashed a fucking sledgehammer down on a really personal matter she would rather not be thinking about during something that's supposed to be fun escapism. Thankfully it didn't ruin the idea of the game for her, and I was able to bring both Her and the Rogue to my main game. \n\nTL;DR: Don't bring Fetishes into your games. Also I don't know how to end this.",

        "text": "* [&lt;&lt; previous](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/76uuk6/vtm_jalees_kamal_villain_by_proxy_part_12/)\n\nFor two games, I said maybe a grand total of a hundred words. I did big things in the background, pushed agendas for the other characters - particularly Miser and Thea - and otherwise didn’t (ab)use Edvin’s abilities directly. For two games I was barely more than a background character, a follower of the players. John and I had talked a bit, usually during one of his smoke breaks. He had been taking less of them as we went on. Game twenty two is where the end of it all started. There was an outside group of vampires in town, and Edvin got a tip off before they started causing trouble.\n\nGame twenty two is when the Tremere came back to town. \n\nLady ST opened the session with everyone attending Elysium, and a group of eight Tremere barging in halfway through one of the Prince’s updates on the Anarch problem.\n\nTremere: “We have an interest in one of the members of this Domain, Prince Santino.”  \nPrince: “Do you now? Yes, Edvin is right over there.”  \nTrem: “No, Prince Santino, we would like to speak with King. We will return him when we are done.”  \n\nJohn looked at me. I looked at him.\n\nJohn: “What?”  \nMe: “What?”  \nJohn: “What did you do?”  \nMe: “What did *I* do? What did **you** do?”  \nJohn: “Well why do the Tremere want me?”  \nMe: “I dunno. Did you happen to steal some information you weren’t supposed to know?”  \nJohn: “That’s what this is about?”  \nMe: “Best guess. Tremere don’t take kindly to thieves.”  \nJohn: *realizing* “[Silly]... Edvin didn’t turn him in, did he?”  \nMe: “That sounds like a good question to ask him.”  \n\nAnd so, King was hauled off by a squad of Tremere and interrogated for his sources. King was relatively low generation, so none of the squaddies could break him with Dominate. They would have to call in an Elder Tremere to really put the screws to him. To do so, they would need to contact the local Regent and inform him, and get his permission to request aid from an elder. It just so happened that the local Regent was an elder, and so they asked him for aid.\n\nEdvin carefully took the bag off of King’s head, and tossed it aside. He had suffered many wounds during the torture, but he hadn’t cracked. Edvin had a bowl of hot water, and went about cleaning the blood and dirt and muck off of King’s face and body. King was incredulous, and just a bit delirious.\n\nKing: “What are you doing, Edvin?”  \nEdvin: “Cleaning you up.”  \nKing: “Why? Why are you here?”  \nEdvin: “I’m the next one to interrogate you. The others don’t have enough power of the blood to bend your mind with Dominate, and so they requested the local Regent to aid them. I am here in my official capacity as the Regent of the local Tremere chantry.”  \nKing: “But… you can’t. You would break the oath of the coterie.”  \nEdvin: “Yes, I would. By raising my hand directly against you, by using a power of the blood against you, I would be dismissed from the coterie.”  \nKing: “So it’s true. The Tremere back the clan first.”  \nEdvin: “Yes, they do.”  \nKing: “Did you call them?”  \nEdvin: “No. I was alerted late yesterday that they would arrive tonight, and that they were hunting someone in connection with a breach of security in regards to some Tremere data. I did not know whom their target was.”  \nKing: “I don’t know if I can believe that.”  \nEdvin, laughing: “I don’t need you to believe me, you dolt. The truth is still the truth.”  \nKing: “What do you need to know?”  \nEdvin: “I forgive you.”  \nKing: “What?”  \nEdvin: “I forgive you, King.”  \n\nAnd King told Edvin how he had gotten the information that he did. He, via Brain, had hired the Nosferatu information network to investigate Edvin, and he had gotten exactly what he had paid for. The information network was able to build what amounted to a complete dossier on Edvin’s public life for the past six hundred years, and were mostly accurate for the two hundred odd years before that as well. The Tremere elected not to pursue the Nosferatu, mostly because they also relied upon the Sewer Rats for their information at times. They left town.\n\nAfter that, King was very, very different. He didn’t get too much of a chance to portray it, but he thought he had gained a measure of understanding of what Edvin stood for, and why he did what he did. King didn’t become Edvin’s biggest fan overnight, but he began to ease up around him. Edvin was pleased to see King’s progress, as was I - and the rest of the group - to seeing John’s progress. Step by step, he curbed his less than positive social tendencies.\n\nAs the rest of the game played out with the Anarch negotiations, the finishing of the clean up from the Infernal disease, and dealing with the sudden appearance - and disappearance - of a Tremere interrogation squad. This focused mainly on Thea and King with the Anarchs and Miser, Brain and Edvin for the others.\n\nThea and King had been having a hell of a time convincing the Anarchs of anything after the initial meeting. If they hadn’t been so certain that the vampires were who they said they were, they would have sworn that the Anarchs that came to the meeting the first time weren’t the ones that had come to all subsequent meetings. Frustrated with the pace of negotiations, both the Prince and the Anarchs at large were having trouble containing the border spats between their respective members. The threat of Masquerade breaches, and the summary justice that followed, was having less and less effect on slowing the issue.\n\nMiser and Brain were having a much easier, if longer, time of cleaning up the aftermath of the Infernal disease. Edvin had already done the most of the work against the disease, with eliminating the actual disease, as well as devising a ritual to cleanse whole sections of the city at once of the remnants. Miser and Brain, however, had to deal with the much larger, and arguably harder, task of cleansing the public’s memory of the incident and moving the city back into the roaring night life that it had had before the incident began. They had to wield their combined influence effectively, efficiently, but most importantly - invisibly. If anyone noticed that a cover-up was being attempted, serious issues may arise.\n\nEdvin, then, was left to mostly his own devices. After a little more than six months of playing this game weekly (we skipped a few weeks), I was about ready to be done playing Edvin, and to take my leave. I had had enough of an impact on the John, and the group, that I thought that Lady ST and Sabrina could continue to rehabilitate John as necessary. As the game drew to a close that night, I looked over to Lady ST and nodded.\n\nMe: “I think next game should be Edvin’s last.”  \nLady ST: “Are you sure?”  \nMe: “Yes. I’ve had a great time, and everything’s been a blast, but I think that Edvin’s story is just about done.”  \nGroup: Various pleas to continue  \nMe: “No, no. I had a specific goal when I created Edvin, and I think it’s time to get it completed and move on.”  \nThea: “Well, what goal was that? You haven’t done much of anything the past few games…”  \nMe: “It’s not quite done, but I think that Lady ST can make it happen next game.”  \nLady ST: “If you think it’s time, then yeah.”  \nMe: “I do. It’s time for the go order.”  \nGroup: “The what?”  \nMe: “Next game, I promise.”  \n",

        "author": "bionicle_fanatic",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/76ym0f/playing_solo_a_transcription/",
        "text": "Despite doing my best to give the concept of solo D&amp;D a brief overview, I’ve had a lot of people ask me about how it’s actually done. It would appear that playing without a DM is as foreign to some people as the idea of TTRPGs was to me when all I’d played before was board games; I couldn’t wrap my head around *what* an RPG actually was. People said it was a collaborative storytelling experience with rules, which accurately describes it if you’re familiar with it. But that meant nothing to me before I got my first sourcebook. It only clicked when I read a transcript of an actual game, where I figured out that it wasn’t so much about moving around a board and collecting pickups, but more like a sophisticated version of cowboys and indians. Needless to say, my mind was blown.\n\nSo to help people understand what in the nine hells I’m actually talking about, I’m gonna make this little transcript thingie from a solo game. This is my first attempt at doing something like this, so bear with me.\n\nI recently got the Tortle package, so this gives me an excellent excuse to run it. I’ve briefly scanned through it before, and I’m not expecting the same epic plot or insane odds that the other characters are currently facing in the game. This will be more of a laid back, peaceful little side-story; Much like how I imagine the Tortle lifestyle to be.\n\nThis also takes place on the plane of elemental life, which I’m just about to invent in the main chronicle. It’s basically Chult: a lush, dense jungle filled with greenery and living things. And not-living things. I can’t really explain why there are undead waltzing around the last place you’d expect them to be, because spoilers. In fact, I can foresee a fair bit that will have to remain vague until it’s revealed in the original story. Still, that shouldn’t be too much of a bother, because our protagonist for the day doesn’t exactly have a wealth of inside knowledge.\n\n* * *\n\nOur hero is a Tortle named Enok, a friendly, selfless, inquisitive Stone Sorcerer. Bit of an unoptimised build, I’ll admit, but the primordial nature of the stone sorcerers fit too well in my mind with the reptile-like Tortles to worry about the AC redundancy. Enok is the last in a line of guardians sworn to look after the treasure of a shrine deep within the jungle, a shrine that just so happened to be plundered in a previous adventure by some other characters. Freed from his duty, Enok is finally giving in the urge to explore and see the world; Starting with his homeland, the Snout of Omgar.\n\nScene 1; Enok arrives on the island. I’m not sure where yet, so I ask the virtual DM where he lands, by way of Mythic’s yes/no system: \n\nThe most likely place he’d land would be the nearest shore, that being High Horn. Does Enok land at the High Horn? (Rolls d%, 50% chance: 87) \n\nOkay, so he avoids that area due to the many wrecked ships dotted about it. Does that mean he’s sailing on a proper ship? I kind of imagined him on one of those coracle things… (50% chance: 67) \n\nSo he’s not on a proper ship, but the rocks look jagged enough to wreck even his dingy little craft. He’s going to continue around the east side of the island, because the shape of the land looks like it might provide a cove of some sort. He wants to land as quickly as possible instead of scouting around the shore for a settlement, due to his coracle not really being crafted for open sea traversal.\n\nThe package has two random encounters for two terrain types, land and water, the latter being a strange choice in my opinion. It would have made more sense to include “volcano”, as much of the island is taken up by just that. I nonetheless check for a random encounter as Enok circles around the High Horn and heads towards the beach, but nothing pops up.\n\nScene 2: Investigating the statue. Enok knows nothing of the Snout of Omgar, but he did spy the giant tortle carving at High Horn, which makes that his first destination. Before he gets there however, we should check if anything modifier or interrupts this scene. This is a favourite feature of mine from Mythic, as it stops the adventure following a completely logical, boring path: It adds inspiration and initiative from the virtual DM’s part. I roll a D10 to get an 8, which is higher than the current Chaos Rating (4 at this time, due to the laid-back nature of the previous scene). We proceed to the High Horn unchallenged, and find everything as expected.\n\nWhile Enok marvels at the stonework of his people, I should figure out a few features of the area. A couple of the shipwrecks are submerged during a low tide, says the package, so with complete disregard for tidal physics (this *is* a fantasy world that doesn’t have a moon) I ask if the tide is high during the middle of the morning: A result of 38 with a 50% chance means a yes. \n\nThis raises complications for Enok: The package also states that a two-headed plesiosaurus prowls the water at high tide. Enok, being the curious little fellow he is, can’t resist going to investigate the wrecked ships. \n\nChecking the stats for the dinosaur, I see that it’s a double-deadly challenge even without the modifications for two heads. While I’d normally let actions have consequences and let the encounter play out RAW (most likely killing off the little guy in the process), I think I’m going to be kind and adjust things a tad. Playing with a single character require a more strict adherence to challenge ratings, especially at lower levels.\n\nSo one quick visit to Kobold Fight Club and we have our adversary: A giant crab, scuttling up out of the shallows to attack. I roll stealth for the creature and it fails to keep under Enok’s watchful radar. I use a custom chart to determine the distance between the two: 160 feet. I roll initiative for both of them, and combat begins.\n\n* * *\n\nA side note about fighting in solo D&amp;D: I’ve been playing games against myself for as long as solo dodgeball was a thing, so it’s not hard for me to act as a brutal opponent to myself. While Mythic does a great job at creating stories and worlds for characters to inhabit, it’s also very easy to game the system. Asking the virtual DM if you find a legendary item on the road into town and giving it a 95% chance is an actual thing you can do. But it doesn’t make any sense, as well as making the success of obtaining an item worthless. If you’re in it to win it, solo D&amp;D might not be for you. But I’m not playing for the gold, for the magic items, or the XP. I’m playing for the story, both the good and bad. I’ve lost five characters in the last week, some of which I had really high hopes for becoming new favourites of mine. In that same week my main cast faced off against a challenge that was double their maximum challenge rating, and managed to somehow survive. It’s the lows that make the highs all the worth it. Each treasured character that falls makes the ultimate victory against their slayer all the more sweeter. \n\n* * *\n\nAnd thus, battle commences! Enok loses initiative, as any slow little tortoise-man would. The crab scuttles forward. Does it take the dash action? (80% chance, as he’s probably hungry: 60). The crab closes the distance to 100 feet. Enok doesn’t really want to harm the beast, as it’s only trying to survive. He takes a few steps forward and casts the *Sleep* spell. He send the crustacean tripping over its own hurrying legs as it falls into a deep slumber. He then decides to make a hasty exit from the beach before the spell wears off. \n\n* * *\n\nNo food, no water, and no sense of direction. These are all threads which Enok will have to complete in the next few days if he wants to survive. It would make sense that other creatures would come and go to see the statue, so he checks the ground for any trace of activity. Tracking DCs are usually around 15, so I roll a d% and add 25 for a total of 77. Dividing that by 5, I get a DC of 15. Enok rolls a survival check and gets a 6. He is completely oblivious of any tracks that may or may not be there, hurrying into the jungle without glancing back.\n\nThird scene: The rest of the day is spent aimlessly travelling around the northernmost part of the island. Enok fails his survival check, so he wastes a lot of time backtracking into areas he’s already been. I check for random encounters, and ask if this scene is altered or interrupted: Nothing. The island is as sleepy and peaceful as I expected.\n\nNext day Enok heads towards the coast, and due to a successful survival check he soon discovers Ahoyhoy, a Tortle village. But what’s this? The virtual DM says the scene is somehow altered. My first thought is that the settlement is being attacked, but vDM says it’s not quite that. I ask wether the place is abandoned, and get a yes answer. Strange. I was hoping for this to be a social encounter, so I could show off how NPC interactions work. It would seem we have a mystery on our hands, instead. There doesn’t seem to be any signs of a scuffle. Were the inhabitants frightened away, perhaps? Did they simply up and leave, as Tortles are want to do? Either way, this calls for some investigating…\n\n* * *\n\nAnd that’s all for now, folks. While I’ll probably pick this up again when I have a spare moment, playing while writing it down is quite time consuming compared to doing just one or the other. Hopefully this has given you a vague idea of how things go down when I play solo. I’ve been purposely vague on the nitty gritty of the rules in Mythic, as I don’t want to inadvertently get accused of copyright infringement. But I’m still hopeful that this has enlightened those who can’t wrap their head around solo play. Next chapter in the tale of Tirkosu should be out in a few days. And trust me, unlike with little Enok and his misadventures, anything with Della, Turf, Flamer, or Lundal in it is definitely going to be epic.",

        "text": "I was told to post it here as well :-)\nIts an Shadowrun Sr5 story : \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Shadowrun/comments/74yhyy/todays_run_will_be_remembered_as_the_magnesium/\n\n**Let me tell you why todays run will be remembered as The Magnesium Torch Run**\n\nThe job was simple (as it always is), infiltrate an abandoned military station in Auburn and extract a shipping container.\n\nThe problem? Some gangers settled in the base. And the feral ghouls in the basement.\nNothing the gang couldn’t handle.\n\nThey started out by scouting the area, which went well, with only one person taking a point blank shotgun blast straight into physical overflow. \n\nAfter some regrouping and more scouting and one tortured guard the gang had the following information:\n\n* The gang is some 30 members strong, but goes on frequent raids that leaves the base with only a skeleton crew of half a dozen.\n* Said skeleton crew does include a rather strong adept\n* Something in the basement of the base, where they need to go, is giving off serious negative magic background count. \n* Said basement is also sealed off by the gang because some people went insane down there and started eating other people.\n\nLong story short, they blow up the adept with a booby trap, drop a few guards and after some hitches enact their plan to free whatever is downstairs to have it and the remaining guards duke it out before picking off the remainder. So far so good.\n\nThey then have to go down below and get the power running again to start moving the container with a very big crane. To do that the “mechanic” of the group finds the auxiliary generator room, which is also where some excess fuel was stored apparently.\n\nUpon noting that the fumes in there might be dangerous the “mechanic” ensures me he has a gas mask so he’ll be fine.\n\nThe situation at this point looks like this:\n\nThe “mechanic” is in the generator room, surrounded by barrels of gasoline. With him is an army flashlight and, if he needs it, a night vision enhanced scoped weapon. The melee adept who helped break down the door is outside, asking if he’s alright in there.\n\nThis is what the mechanic then does:\n\n“I take out and light up a magnesium torch and hand it to the adept”\n\n**. . .**\n\nEveryone does their own little version of “you do WHAT?” while he is fairly oblivious to the implications. He is then told how much damage to defend against as the room turns into a fireball. He is very lucky indeed when all the barrels make their resistance test and not also blow up.\n\nFor some reason that surely made more sense in his head he also needs to be convinced to first see if he makes the resistance test before burning an edge point to survive.\n\nThe adept, who clearly notices the sudden warm blast across his back as he was walking away, shouts back a “was that intentional?” to which the hasted, if probably rather raspy reply of the ever so slightly singed “mechanic” is “Yes absolutely, just wanted to burn away the bodies to be sure”\n\nThe adept, dense as a brick, takes his word for it and continues on his way.\n\n*And thus, the most competent group ever marks another victory.*\n\nI hope you enjoyed reading it ;) \nAs we enjoyed it live in our round quite a lot :D",

This, plus 2-3 more, and that’s the ballgame.\n\nGame nineteen rolls around, and the whole table is tense. Dilton and Trev are looking at Sabrina, Sabrina’s looking at John, and John is looking at me. I’m waiting patiently for Lady ST to start the game. Lady ST draws it out for a bit by shuffling papers around writing down some notes. She looks up some things online and writes down some more notes. Dilton, Trev and Sabrina trade looks, John keeps staring at me, and I smile at nothing and no one in particular. Lady ST takes a drink of water and clears her throat.\n\n“Is Edvin going to go with the Scourge quietly, or is he going to resist?”\n\nIt was at this point that I began to suspect that I was boned.\n\nEdvin, being a naturally easygoing person, agrees to go with the Scourge. The Scourge - otherwise known as the Brujah Primogen - led Edvin to a car, which took them to the outskirts of town, to the lesser used meeting place of the Primogen Council. The Council had been called, and the Scourge had been asked to escort the other members to the premises personally. Edvin was off-puttingly compliant. The Council was called to order, and everyone was told to take their seats.\n\nEveryone except Edvin.\n\nThe Prince spoke at length about the information that he was passing around to the Council members. It included information on Edvin’s current standing in the Tremere hierarchy (not good), Edvin’s whereabouts in the 18th and 19th centuries (not in Camarilla territory), and the nature of the circumstances which brought him to the Domain (completely fabricated). The Prince continued on a short tirade about how even the best presented story will have holes in the details, and that eventually those holes will have a light shown through them.\n\nI turned my shit eating grin to John, and I asked the Prince how long it took King to put the pieces together. The Prince stumbled in his speech and asked what made me think it was King.\n\n&gt;Edvin: “My story, as you call it, was a carefully crafted lie that was meant for King to pull on. It was designed for him to chase his tail endlessly attempting to solve the puzzle, and so I know that he had help from someone with more - and significantly older - contacts than he has access to. I’ve been sent to interact with King and investigate old issues being brought to light.”  \n&gt;Prince: “Your story is written in the style of the most outlandish of fictions. Do you honestly think that we’ll believe anything you tell us?”  \n&gt;E: “No, but I don’t need you to. I am on a mission, and I know that none of you can stop me, even if you tried collectively. I don’t care about you, I don’t answer to you, and I am not at liberty to say who I do answer to. Suffice it to say that it is someone that none of you would question. The name is not well known, but the title is.”  \n&gt;P: “You shovel more lies on top of lies, and offer no proof.”  \n&gt;E: “Well, if you would like to collectively stop me, I can certainly offer it.”  \n&gt;E: “Or…”, here I slide my gaze back to Lady ST, “you can stop wasting my time, and allow me to finish my duty.”  \n&gt;P: “Hardly. You will be detained until either someone comes to retrieve you, or we remember that we left you somewhere and decide to put you out of our misery.”  \n&gt;E: “I must warn you, Prince, that you are making a grave mistake. Should you take action against me, I will have no choice but to report your actions.”  \n\nThat made them pause. At this point it was clear that the Prince intended to stake me and put me in a nice dark closet somewhere for a few years and seeing if that had loosened my tongue. There were a few problems with that, but the most pressing problem was that there was already a full detachment of Jalees’ people moving into the city, and if I didn’t tell them to stay inside every night, the Domain would fall in no more than a month. Secondly, I don’t think I had managed to successfully turn John yet, and that wasn’t a goal I was about to give up.\n\nAnd so Edvin strode up to the council table - one of those real wood, steel reinforced numbers, muttered a quick word, and lifted the whole thing off of the ground and snapped it in two, down the middle. He put the two pieces down again, muttered another word, and then decayed the entire table into nothing more than a few bits of rotten wood and pieces of rusted steel. “This was an enlightening conversation. I hope it was not lost on you.” Edvin turned and left, and no one stopped him. \n\nAnd with that, we returned to the negotiations with the Anarchs. King and Thea had had the upper hand the night before, but this night the Anarchs were in top form, and the pair were having difficulties keeping up their dynamic duo. The Anarchs were able to keep the subject too fluid for either one to pin down any solutions or details. The Anarchs also varied the way at which they approached a subject each time they came to it, casting their desired resolution in a slightly different light, and preventing King or Thea from gaining any traction on a single subject. The pair came back after a long night, and both were surprised to find Edvin reading the evening news on his laptop in the common room.\n\nI think John and Sabrina were expecting a conversation about what King had done. I could see the wheels turn in their heads as I described what Edvin was doing, and in what sorts of clothes - nothing had changed. Edvin wasn’t responding at all to the threats of the Primogen Council, and I seemed to determined to forget it ever happened. \n\nAnd then King decided to push the issue.\n\n&gt;King: “Edvin? I didn’t think you would be back tonight. Didn’t [Brujah Primogen] come to get you yesterday?”  \n&gt;Edvin: “He did, but the meeting ended up being a lot shorter than everyone expected. I can’t go into details, obviously, but the meeting was a success for some more than others. Everyone got their point across, and a lot of information was shared.”  \n&gt;Thea: “You know exactly what he’s talking about, don’t you King?”  \n&gt;K: “Yes.”  \n&gt;T: “Do you want to enlighten the rest of the class?”  \n&gt;E: “It’s just her, isn’t it? It began when she was under the effects of the disease. Brain and Miser already know.”  \n&gt;K, Brain, Miser: “Yes.”  \n&gt;T: “What happened to not keeping secrets from each other, gents?”  \n&gt;K: “Don’t even start with that [silly]. He’s been keeping the greatest secret from all of us. He’s not even a real member of the Camarilla!”  \n&gt;E: “What makes you say that?”  \n&gt;K: “You spent more than 2 centuries outside of Camarilla controlled territory. No one can do that. Somewhere along the line you were converted to the Sabbat. I don’t know why the other Tremere haven’t killed you yet, but someone aught to.”  \n&gt;E: “Think very carefully about that, King. Very carefully. I walked out of a meeting of the Primogen council without any of them laying a finger upon me.”  \n&gt;K: “Don’t think me a child, Eddie. I don’t intend to do a thing. I simply contacted the Tremere about a traitor.”  \n&gt;E: “Oddly reasonable. From whom should I expect a visit?”  \n&gt;K: “Why would I tell you that?”  \n&gt;E: “You *can’t* tell me, is more my point. Whomever you spoke to didn’t believe you, or if they did they didn’t do anything about it. They have a file on me, you know? They have a file on every Tremere. Anybody care to guess what my file is marked?”  \n&gt;Brain: “Top Secret?”  \n&gt;K: “Blood Traitor.”  \n&gt;Miser: “His Holiness!”  \n&gt;E: “Once again, Miser is closest, and he doesn’t quite know why. It says: ‘Edvin Eyvinder, Pontiff of the Sixth Circle’. It says some other things, but that one is the second most important.”  \n\nThat got a lot of looks. Pontiff puts Edvin one ranking level below the Tremere ruling council of seven. There are only 49 Pontiffs in the entire world. This, of course, is a lie. Edvin’s only a Regent, but as we know, Edvin lies very, very well. They looked to Lady ST, who shrugged. Edvin stood, and made to leave.\n\n&gt;King: “What if we don’t believe you?”  \n&gt;Edvin: “King, I will tell you exactly what I told the Council: I don’t need you to believe me. You can’t stand in my way.”  \n\nThe Table was quiet. That had primed the powder keg, and now I just needed to hold off the fuse for a few more games.\n",

Getting around a hill just up ahead, I built some cover and continued to run for safety. He  was undoubtedly consumed in the torrential rain by now. Even so, the shots continued to whiz by my feet, back, and head. Just up ahead a bloke that hadn't heard the fighting was steadily making his way up another hill, to safety.

More grenades burned my heels, and it was only so long before I was caught - either by my pursuer or the storm, whichever was more hungry. I knew what I had to do. Unslinging the old bolt-action from my back, I took a breath, looking at my innocent prey in my scope. \n\n\"You must die so I can live\"\n\nHe would never hear those words, but the shot rang true and he fell.

        "text": "I've recently taken up the task of transcribing two of my GM's Pathfinder games, one of which I'm a player in (takes place in a special military unit dedicated to fighting off the undead), and the other I'm only a spectator (follows a group of young mages as they advance through the ranks of a guild). After getting the permission of the players involved and the GM, I decided to post an edited version of the Mage's campaign here. \n\n##**Terms and Characters:**\n\n**Sribe Bot:** Me.\n\n**Mage’s Guild:** Name is fairly self explanatory, their school for young mages is located close to the City of Dragonscale.\n\n\n**Elizabeth “Beth” Farcrow:** A young human wizard hailing from minor nobility, Beth almost never left her family’s estate prior to enrolling in the guild. Timid and Naive.\n\n\n**Thion Blackreach**: Tiefling son of Lucifer (yes, *the Lucifer*), Thion was put in an orphanage shortly after his birth, remains unaware of his ancestry. Incredibly arrogant, was accepted into the Guild alongside Ardras. Named himself “Blackreach” because he saw the word in a book and thought it looked cool.\n\n\n**Adras aka “Choir Boy”**: A male Aasimar Sorcerer, he was in the same orphanage as Thion. Given special attention by clerics due to his divine heritage, Thion resented him and claimed he was the subject of extensive sexual abuse while in the orphanage, calling him “Choir Boy”.\n\n\n**Saladin**: Human Fighter, by chance, he was also in the same orphanage as Thion and Choir Boy. However, he was recruited by the Guild well before Thion and Choir Boy were. But instead of being recruited as a mage, he was trained to become a warden- a martial fighter assigned to deal with threats to the guild that had resistances to magic.\n\n\n**Mog**: Red Kobold Wizard, Mog left his village to join the guild, wanting to sate his desire for knowledge and not wishing to simply serve the dragon his village worshipped. Kindhearted and generally good natured.\n\n\n**Miro**: Human Sorcerer, son of one of the most powerful fey in setting, does not know his actual parents, was raised by adoptive parents in the nature. Has a tatoo where he holds his companion, a little Rhamphorhynchus.\n\n\n**Thousand Blades**: The King's personal guard, extensive Eastern Influences.\n\n\n**Rule 98**: Just because Lyrica (setting's Goddess of Fertility, Travelers, and Drink) said it was okay does not mean you may be drunk during lectures.\n\n\n##**Part I**:  \n\nMog and Elizabeth, escorted by Warden in Training Saladin, headed off to their first class after a brief thing in the common area. Miro, having broken Rule 98, was in detention for the duration of classes that day, Thion ran late, and Choir Boy’s arrival was delayed. Rolling a d4, they wound up having Arcana as their first class. They were informed that it'd have a new instructor for every class, with this week being taught by one of the Thousand Blades. He decided to have them practice mage armor owing to Saladin being present- Mog would cast Mage Armor on himself, and Saladin would try to beat him with a \"punishment stick\", a non lethal weapon assigned to him (a last minute call from the GM, realizing that Mog's player would have had to roll a new character if he used his halberd). Saladin found himself unable to hit Mog, much to his surprise. Their lesson complete, they headed off to their next class, with Elizabeth screaming at the caged animals (including a Yeti) as they journeyed into the depths of the school.\n\n##**Part II**: \n\nThe group’s next class was in the school's basement, and about concentration. This partuclar lesson was taught by a rather enigmatic fellow, who while mostly concealed in the dark, was eager to teach the young mages. The group was joined by Thion, who had missed their first class for unknown reasons. The key lesson in this class were things that could interrupt a mage’s spell casting, with Mog and Thion being chosen as test subjects. Mog was placed right next to Saladin, and was ordered to cast any sort of spell- if it was a deadly spell, he was to cast it as the instructor. He did as told, only to get whacked with the punishment stick, interrupting his spell. Thion was then asked to cast any spell at the instructor, and complied; the instructor swiftly cast Color Spray on him, knocking him unconscious. Waking him up, he demonstrated how to maintain a spell for longer periods of time (and how to avoid getting interrupted), ending their lesson.\n\n\n##**Part III**: \n\nThe three students and the warden headed off to their third class of the day, where they were informed that their tuition would be paid through indentured servitude to the school through the production of spell scrolls for the global market. Thion, being a little smart ass, decided to give the teacher lip- as it turns, she was equally sarcastic, and after walking up to him and telling him that he knew all that he needed to know to graduate, he had Color Spray cast on him for the second time that day. After he recovered, he was put to work alongside his fellow classmates, somehow being the best at scroll making ~~despite not taking it as a feat and only being allowed take part because of GM favoritism~~. After laboring away for a sufficient amount of time, their “lesson” was complete.\n\n\n##**Part IV**: \n\nAfter learning how to toil away for the benefit of the school, they were sent to their fourth class of the day, bloodlines, starting with Aberrant. They brought in an Aberrant (who Thion decided to question about the identity of his ancestors), eventually pitting Saladin and Thion against two in a fight to the death after an explanation of the bloodline. Emerging victorious (albeit, Saladin getting hurt), they moved onto Abyssal. Thion took offence at the bloodline type having been \"tainted by filth\", which prompted a discussion about demon vs devils, before they brought in a low level demon that was restrained, who Thion also decided to question about his ancestry (this time asking if it had a clue who his father was).\n\n\n##**Part V**: \n\nThe last bloodline discussed was Accursed. Apart from an explanation of its powers, being told to not make deals with hags, and a sick burn against Beth made by Thion regarding hags, not a whole lot to say. The group was then released for the day, and hung out in the common area. Thion decided to paint, which prompted Elizabeth to ask him a couple of things, leading him to open up about Choir Boy's absence (saying he couldn’t stand him, but wanted him around to make fun of), along with her asking him to teach her how to sketch. Mog also chose to chime in, exchanging some pleasantries with Beth. \n\nOur GM, deciding the end of classes was a good place to stop, the session ended there.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/76en9o/my_continued_experiences_playing_solo_dd/",
        "text": "[The story so far:](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/767n9h/my_experiences_playing_solo_dd/) I introduce the perks of solo, mobile D&amp;D, and create some characters. They exceed expectations. \n\n* * *\n\nWow, I've only just remembered something. I came very close dropping the team I'd only just created. \n\nYou see, although MoM was a success, it took me two days to complete. For a single dungeon, that was inordinate amount of time for me back then. The problem was the amount of characters I was playing. Beforehand I'd stuck to parties of two, as it was small enough to be manageable while also allowing some RP dynamic. The problem with *that* was, most big modules aren't designed for such a small group. I could have scaled up encounters on the fly, but that was a hassle and I wanted to really feel like I'd completed the whole module. But having seen how long things took with four characters, and having finally scanned in my favourite published adventure (Princes of the Apocalypse), I decided to give them a break until I figured out how to speed things up. \n\nSo I created a new duo, an Aaracokra Monk hailing from the birdfolk monastery who was being paid to teach a spoiled human girl how to survive in the wild. I don't know, it probably made more sense at the time. I don't even remember their names; they got as far as the introductory dungeon before dieing to the necromancer miniboss at the end. I did a metaphorical table flip, and decided the extended play time was worth it if the characters actually survived. But looking back, it was a close shave: if monk and brat had survived, the epic tale that unfolded over the next year might not have ever happened. \n\nTheir short-lived adventure wasn't worthless however, as it acted as the hook which introduced the actual team into PotA. When the bodies of the two were found dumped in the center of the nearby village with a eye symbol carved in their foreheads, Della got her team together again to investigate. They arrived to find the place flooded with undead, which they quickly ploughed through, and put down the necromancer controlling them. This in turn led to them investigating the individual elemental cults. \n\nWell, I say investigating. It was more like a standard dungeon crawl than the covert infiltration the book seems to want the players to do. You see, I'd already played through the first couple of chapters in that stealthy style during a previous campaign, and I wanted to switch it up a bit. It also fit with Turf's preferred style: go in, wreck everything, and get the hell out before things got tough. It was fun, but it was a bit of a grind. I remember Riverguard Keep best, the water castle dungeon. It was quite thematically appropriate, because I played through it while on the worst ferry crossing I've ever experienced. Seriously, you went into the bathrooms and there was literally vomit on the *ceiling*. I mean, how does one even manage to do that, even gives the massive waves we were experiencing? It was like the real elements themselves were rebelling as I plunged deeper into the cultist's lair. Very fun, for me. Not so much the poor soul who'd defiled the bathroom. \n\nAt this point I actually drew up a proper map of Empai Tirkosu, and filled in some proper worldbuilding details. Still very rough, but that was okay. With solo play it's a good idea to stay vague about something until it's directly referenced in game, as the virtual DM requires a fair bit of improv to work. But at the moment the island's geography was less than vague, bordering on nonexistent. So out came the pencils. I decided on a few main towns dotted about with a smattering of smaller settlements around the mainland, and, of course, the big steampunk city, Orthraze. I also established the ten main races, and because I'm a Bionicle nut I affiliated each one with an element: Dwarves with Earth, Aaracokra with air, Aasimar with light, Merfolk with water, Golath (basically non-nomad Goliaths after a typo) with ice, Elves with life (or, greenery), Gnomes with steam, Warforged with fire, Elkore (custom race with martian eyes and a hair thickness 50x the norm) with smoke, and humans with dust. \n\nI spent extra time statting out the nearest village, a place called Rahg Krahv (the name coming from the Golath that had started the settlement, and totally not a random generator). So, naturally, virtual DM decided the earth cultists were going to bomb the place. And so they did, wiping out half the population and three hours of work. It was annoying, but it made me hate the cultists more than the system. We returned to the grind with a vengeance. \n\nIt was around this time that the individual combat styles of the characters were forming. Turf was a straight up powerhouse, flattening everything and anything in her way. Flamer had mastered his druids transformations, now able to turn into mechanical animals at will. Della was very nimble despite wearing heavy armor, while also being surprisingly strong; at times, she even outmatched Turf in damage output. Lundal... Complained a lot. He wasn't too keen on delving into ancient Dwarven mines in search of elemental cultists, even if it meant a shortened prison stint. A fat lot of good liberty was if he wasn't alive to enjoy it. Despite this, he was pretty effective in combat. He'd found an octopus familiar in Riverguard Keep, and was wearing the thing on his head. As it counted as an ally, he was getting sneak attacks every single round. He also called it Nora. \n\nThey eventually reached the fane of the Elder Elemental Eye, which I shortened to the Elder Eye for some reason. They met the Black Earth prophet, who waffled on about how the all-seeing Eye would be their eventual doom. They shrugged it off as lunacy and bumped him off, Turf claiming his silver warpick as her own. It was time for the final dungeon of the module: the fire node. \n\nThey were woefully underleveled. Thanks to Turf's in-and-out style of combat they hadn't been able to clear every single room in each dungeon, meaning that a level thirteen area was being challenged by a group of level eights. Five levels is basically a whole tier in D&amp;D. The module provides many chances for side quests for this purpose, but the virtual DM had set a ticking clock by making the cultists bomb Rahg Krahv. The team was hell-bent on destroying the cultists before they had an opportunity to unleash a devastation orb elsewhere, regardless of whether they were prepared to face the challenge. So in they went. \n\nIt was chaos. Let me try to put into perspective how insane of a fight it was: The final fight consisted of Vanifer the fire prophet, who on her own was a deadly challenge for the team. Then on top of that, there was a fire elemental and a young red dragon, who together made up a second deadly challenge. They were all coming at us with full strength, and we were already below peak performance from dealing with some flameskulls on the way there. Add to that the timer which the virtual DM had kindly added, ticking down as Vanifer concentrated to the moment when an all-consuming fire elemental would be summoned, and... We should have died. We *should* have died. \n\nBut we didn't. Lundal changed headfirst into the fire elemental and tore its molten body to pieces, Della and turf worked together to confuse the dragon as they darted out of reach of its fire breath, and Flamer, in one of those epic moment where everything falls into place perfectly, transformed into a giant steampunk eagle and rescued turf as she was tossed out over the lava. I hadn't been checking his Wild Shape ability for a while, and when it seems like they were going to lose their heavy hitter I was delighted to discover that 8th level provided no flying restrictions. I'm sure there's a trope out there for critical abilities being unlocked at the last moment, but I really don't want to lose myself in TVTropes again. \n\nSo they did it. Against insane odds, they managed to take down all three adversaries. Flamer gave the final strike, plunging Vanifer's own dagger into her with a heroic battle line. I can't remember what his exact words were, but I believe they were something like: \"I'm sorry. But I am going to have to burn you to the ground.\" Flamey was always anything but impolite, even to his enemies. \n\nThe team slow-mo walked out of the elemental node to the fitting tune of Sonic Librarian's *Dice Of Gods.* Flamer, battle scarred and clutching the dagger, named Tinderstrike. Turf, carrying the heavy warpick on her shoulder and grinning ever so slightly. Lundal, jaw set and staring straight ahead through the welding goggles he constantly wore. Della, leaning on her staff from the many burns, but smiling. The island was free from elemental evil. Imix would not be crossing over to this plane any time soon. \n\n* * *\n\nIf the virtual DM had a physical form, he'd have been cackling and rubbing his hands together at that moment. Because something big was brewing. PotA was officially over, but the team's adventures certainly weren't. And I've found that the best storylines spring up when the imagination is left to run wild, free from the constraints of an official module. This moment of epic destiny, this success against the impossible? It was just the eye of the storm. And the forecast was cloudier than it had ever been. \n\n",

        "text": "We begin where we left off, our heroes watching the pale, captivating form of the White Lady floating off into the woods before dawn. A flash of unnatural blue light started the three men, but upon investigation, it was revealed to be the missing girl, Annie. She was covered in blood, pale and frightened, but she seemed to not be fully present. She had a faraway look in her eyes, as if dreaming while awake. When Tower picked her up, she cried and cried, and finally collapsed of exhaustion. With the sun's rays rising, the three men returned to the village of Gavony, carrying a sleeping Annie and leading a thoroughly frightened Farmer Zarovich behind them.\n\nBefore they can even fully recover from their injuries, the town's senile old mayor tasks them with traveling to the various farms outside the village to ask the outlying farmers to stay with the other townsfolk until the \"ghost\" can be dealt with. The elf Van Helsing asked his wife, Anna, to start trying to convince the other townsfolk to install Tower as mayor while they are gone, and she in turn warned him to be careful.\n\nOut in the forest, as they decided to visit the furthest out home first, the wizard Rizzo noticed a corpse trapped under a felled log. They managed to pull the body out from underneath, and failing to recognize her, searched for for anything they could use to identify her. They found only a note written in a language they didn't understand and a coin, which Rizzo identified as being at least 1,500 years old, possibly older. \n\nInspecting the corpse itself, they found puncture marks on the dead woman's wrist, and spiders had taken up residence inside the body. While Van Helsing and Tower dig her a shallow grave, Rizzo started to piece together that all of the events of the past few days were similar to children's stories of vampires, but that vampires hadn't been seen for almost a thousand years. \n\nThe party continued onward after the burial, when Van Helsing spotted bandits hiding behind trees. The bandit leader, upon realizing they had been spotted, stepped out behind the tree with his bow drawn and ordered his fellows to do the same, one of which had a big hound with him.\n\nThey told the party that they would be allowed to pass if they put all of their valuables on the ground, the \"Lady's Tax\", they called it. The party realized that these men were connected to the ghost woman somehow, and noticed that dreamy look in their eyes, the same as the child had. After failing to convince the bandits that they also worked for the White Lady, the wizard Rizzo surprised the bandit leader with a color spray spell, knocking him out and beginning combat.\n\nThe fight was long and grueling. Tower was the first to fall, but Rizzo laid down a spell of *grease* to trip the dog that kept trying to eat Tower. Van Helsing was knocked out by a stray arrow. Rizzo had taken care of all the bandits, but when he went to destroy the still-slipping dog, the first bandit to fall got back up. He took a knife wound from Rizzo as he revived one of his fallen comrades with a healing potion, but with the two of them, they held Van Helsing hostage, forcing Rizzo to surrender.\n\nThe three were taken to the Bandit's camp, where they were tied to posts and healed fully, for the satisfaction of the White Lady, who would return when night fell. \n\nNodding at his friends, Tower burst free of his bonds, using the rope he had been tied with as a weapon. While the guards were distracted, Van Helsing used the knife hidden in his boot to get free, and Tower ordered him to run. And run he did, as fast as he could, to his shame. He even left behind the weapons that had been passed down through his family for generations. \n\nAs Tower fought off the bandits, Rizzo's familiar, a hawk, loosened his bonds enough that he was able to slip free and join the fray, magic and might and pure dumb luck winning the day. After executing the bandits for their crimes, the two collected Van Helsing's weapons and returned to town, much to everyone's delight. The three men decided to take a few days to rest, to recover, and to plan what to do next.\n\n\n\n",

We edit out the small talk and other things that aren’t part of the story.\n\nOur fourth story arc, Victorian Age Vampire “Diluted” is special to me for many reasons. It was the first time Quin, a player in our other story arcs, has ever been a ST/DM for a game. It blows me away that he was willing to try it out for the first time ever in a format that people can see online. He was awesome in setting the mood and tone of Victorian Era England, and was great in playing NPCs and telling a fun story I had the pleasure in playing in.\n\nSo here it goes, the full chapter playlist of Victorian Age Vampire “Diluted”. I hope you enjoy!\n\nIt is the start of the year 1848. Kings and Queens hold on absolute power is slipping away. Mankind is leaving nature behind for the safety and efficiency of coal and steam powered machines in the cramped and diseased cities. Great machines do the work of dozens in half the time even as they are operated by children. Science, which can be claimed by any person with a loud enough voice, is bringing brand new medicine to every street corner. For the ones living in the dark, this means little until one such health tonic proves to have rather unpleasant side effects.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlI7udTBmjbEt-ZF5tpX6TMaas7OuU0nS\n\nCheck us out on Soundcloud \nhttps://soundcloud.com/twin-cities-by-night\n\nWe are also in the iTunes store and other Podcast apps!\n\nFind us on Twiiter!\nhttps://twitter.com/Twin_Cities_VtM\n",

        "text": "**TL;DR: I explain the concept of playing D&amp;D solo and mobile, and create my characters. They turn out to be very promising. This is a long one, that needs to be long, so grab some popcorn and a shake.**\n\nI Play Alone\n\nSo, weird thing about me: as far as I know, I'm the world's first single-player, 100% mobile D&amp;D group. \n\nWhich would technically make me not a group, as it's just me, but there we go. Mostly this is because I live in the sticks, where asking someone I they'd like to join your D&amp;D group would be met with a blank stare and a shrug. But it's also because, well... It's the sticks. There isn't anyone else to ask. And when you're living in the same room as four other people? Even without horrific social anxiety it would be a chore to play online. So instead, I did what I've always done: played it all myself. \n\n\"But Fanatic,\" I hear you ask, \"how can you play D&amp;D without other people? If you're acting as both DM and player, doesn't it stop being a proper game at some point?\" Quite true. You can't play a \"proper\"  game that lacks a DM without it simply becoming a session of let's pretend. Luckily, solutions do exist for those wanting to play alone, the best one being the Mythic GM Emulator. At its very basic level it's a simple yes/no system, where you ask questions and receive answers from the dice. A lot of improv and adaptability is needed to run something cohesive, but when you get into the meat and bones of the system it's almost as good as having a real-life DM. \n\n\"But Fanatic,\" I hear you pipe up, \"surely you can't be 100% mobile? Don't you have all the books, papers, dice, etc.?\" Yes, actually. But they're all in digital format. Everything from the adventures, to the character sheets, even the dice are all stored on my tablet. This allows me to do two things;\n\n1, play anywhere. And I mean, anywhere. I've trudged through wave echo cave while in the middle of the English Channel. I've explored pyramids spawned from magic beans while taking my evening walk. I've had characters meet their doom in the back of taxis. And I've trudged through the deepest jungles while lying on a Mediterranean beach. \n\nAnd 2, I get to play at any time. Because everything is digitally stored, I can whip out my tablet while, for example, waiting in line at a supermarket, plough into a couple of demons or two, pause the game when the lady in front has *finally* stopped chatting with the guy behind the checkout, and resume the battle when I have a free moment. This means I go through modules really, really quick. I think the fastest was Storm King's Thunder, which lasted me less than a week. \n\nSo that's my setup. No fancy setups, snazzy dice towers, or even physical character sheets. Just me and the \"virtual DM\", as I've come to call the combination of Mythic and the random generators I use. Solo D&amp;D. Some people think I'm a weirdo for playing like that. And they have a point, because it sounds like it would just produce a bunch of boring \"go there, kill this\", CRPG-like stories, right? Well, that's what I kinda thought too, at first. But now? I'm a die-hard convert. \n\nAnd hopefully, the following saga will convince you too.\n\n* * * \n\nCreating Legends\n\nI've been running campaigns in the same setting for a little over a year now. Beforehand I'd played in a faerun style world, where magic was rampant and you were just as likely to encounter a slaad as you were a goblin. It was fun, but it felt like a \"D&amp;D world\". There was little consistency, and sporadic plot. Not to say it wasn't epic: it certainly was. But after literally ending that world, I decided it was time to make something different. Something interesting. I'd tested the waters with the Mythic system, and it worked. It was time to take it to the next level. \n\nThere were two things I knew while dreaming up this new playground: it was going to be an island, and it was going to have steampunk tech in it. I'd been reading the old Eberron sourcebooks, so that influenced the latter side of the world's theme. The island thing is because I'm a huge tiki fan. Anything related to Polynesian culture (the Maori in particular) is instantly good in my book. Observant users who've seen my username might know where I'm coming from. \n\nThus, Empai Tirkosu was born. I honestly have no idea where the name came from. It might have been as out-there as a prophetic dream, or as simple as a chocolate wrapper name with the words slightly mixed up. But it sounded right. \"EM-pie teer-KO-sue\". It has a certain ring to it that just clicked with me. \n\nI had no idea about the lay of the land. My situation at the time meant I didn't have access to any graphical editing software, and with my horrendous artistic skills a physical map was out of the question. So instead of going all out with the world building, I focused on the characters. The main cast, if you will. \n\nFlamer was the first. I'd been browsing a lot of fantasy art, and was steadily getting bored with the large amount of full plate armor knights, shirtless druids, and hooded rogues. Then I came across a pic of a warforged, coppery-gold in color and radiating a regal air like Sean Bean with a crown on. It was fantastic, but there was something *too* epic about it; This was a character in his final form, at the end of countless unimaginable adventures. I was creating a level 1 rookie. So I kept on looking until I found yet another warforged: standing tall and looking upwards while wispy flames licked his char-colored limbs. There was something very vulnerable about this new image that perfectly contrasted the heroic stance of the former one. This was perfect, this was the hero in his early days. It was there and then that I formulated Flamer's backstory. \n\nHe was a warforged. A mechanical soldier, one of the many. Sworn to protect the trade empire (it was called *Empai* Tirkosu after all). An average warrior, just doing his duty, sir. Until an accident with some energy crystals destroyed his unit, leaving him as the only survivor; and wielding an apparently innate control over fire. \n\nThis was an okay start, but I wanted to put a spin on things. A couple of questions put to the \"virtual DM\" confirmed it; warforged were not supposed to have any innate connection to magic. Arcane magic, sure. But magic without study was seen as unreliable in even normal beings; in a warforged, the unknown effects were downright dangerous. Fear of technology is an interesting and current theme in the real world, after all. \n\nNext up was Della, a half-elf. I actually modeled her with Nick Fury in mind, because I decided she was going to be the glue that held the team together. But she wasn't going to be the tough, special agent type of character. Quite the opposite: Dell was sweet, innocent, and slightly shy. The perfect waifu, if you'll excuse the anime term, except for the fact that she was a cleric of the Supreme One (a deity pulled from my previous game), and had taken an oath of chastity. Basically a nun with impressive bo staff skills and divine magic. \n\nI created Lundal while en route from London, which is probably where the name came from. I already had an idea of what their first adventure together was going to entail, and from previous experience running Mines Of Madness I decided they needed a Bilbo Baggins. A burglar. Lundal was created to fill that role. As a gnome, he'd worked on the interior design of the Warforged during the Great War, but when the fighting died down and the engineers were laid off he fell on hard times. Lund had lost his fiancé in an aerial bombing, and was dealing with the grief by gambling. A lot. This led to him stealing and selling illegal tech, which eventually landed him in jail. That was the hook that led to lead him to the team; help them break into the mine, and he'd earn time off his sentence. \n\nAnd finally, Turf. Megan Bridgewater, who preferred to be called by her nickname, was created to be the muscle of the team. We had Flamer the magic user, Della the healer, Lundal the trapmaster. We needed a heavy hitter, and an ex-military Berserker Unit was the perfect fit. I'd already decided there was going to be a heavy focus on the elements in this campaign, and Turf being an earth genasi fit that theme. She'd come from a rich family that was only rolling in it because of her absent father, an uncaring Dao who gave them the gold in return for their firstborn son to train up as an elite warrior. Turf was the tomboy sort, and had excelled in the Great War; but now that there was no imminent threat, she was getting restless. Della's team was the perfect distraction.\n\nWhen I created these characters, I decided to run them thorough a mini-adventure to give me a chance to explore their personality independent from the inevitable group. They were just small, one-encounter little plots, like something you'd find in an introductory Adventurers' League module. I actually only remember Flamer's in proper detail. Lundal stole some magitek (I think), Della exposed some cultists, and Turf... Killed something, probably. They weren't really important, but they helped me get into the groove. I think Flamer's one in particular stood out because of how cinematic it was, and because it set the tone for the campaign perfectly. \n\nSo the first \"scene\". Adventure structure is quite cinematic in Mythic, which makes dungeons crawls slightly difficult but allows the overall adventure feel a lot more like a movie. The first scene was set only a year after the end of the Great War, and ran something like this. \n\n*Captain Veil, a low ranking officer wearing a discreet combat exosuit and outlandish purple hair highlights, walks briskly down an wooden paneled hallway reminiscent of an expensive hotel. She opens the doorway at the far end and steps through to a room cluttered with maps and strategy tables, lit by the orange glow of a setting sun through a large Georgian-style window. At a central desk sits a man in his thirties wearing a crisp white military uniform, his jet black hair swept back from an angular face. This man is Grayson Strell, the Grand High Commander of the military.*\n\nVeil: You wished to see me, sir? \n\nStrell: Indeed. (*Sets down his pen and pressed his fingertips together*) The warforged. How's he coming along? \n\nVeil: Number T-K19? \n\nStrell: The same. Any news from the lab coats? \n\nVeil: (*Apologetically*) He's only been conscious for two days, sir. We've been focusing more on his physical injuries than any... Effects he may have sustained. \n\nStrell: Hm. And you're quite sure that what he displayed was magical in nature? Not a, system failure or residue energy crystal? \n\nVeil: Positive. He... He was able to create a small fire in his own hand. It wasn't unintentional. \n\nStrell: I see. (*Stands, turning to face the window with his arms folded*) Take him with you. Tonight. You're looking into those smugglers, aren't you? \n\nVeil: Well that's true, but he isn't ready. His reflexes are still far from the standard-\n\nStrell: Forget his physical limitations. Take him along with the unit, and observe his behaviour. Take a note of any magical outburst. \n\nVeil: And? If he does display any... Irregularities? \n\nStrell: (*Pauses*) We terminate him. \n\nVeil. I... Yes, sir. (*Turns to leave*)\n\nStrell: And Charlotta? \n\nVeil: (*Looks back,  a half-smile on her face*)\n\nStrell: Be careful out there. \n\nVeil: Always, sir. (*Exits*)\n\n*Scene change. Panning across another corridor, filled with bronze pipes and ending in a brass airlock. It opens with a hiss to an airship hanger converted into a running track. Two men in protective suits spray down a char-colored warforged, his chest heaving from the training despite not actually needing to breathe. Captain Veil approaches the metal man.*\n\nVeil: Flamed up again? \n\nT-K19: (*Nods*)\n\nVeil: But only a little, this time? \n\nT-K19: (*Shakes his head*) \n\nVeil: The Grand High Commander wants you in the unit tonight. You think you're ready? \n\nT-K19: (*Grins*) Ready. \n\n* * *\n\nThings didn't go as planned for Flamey, that night. While Veil had managed to keep his powers a secret up until then, he ultimately gave himself away by displaying them in front of the whole unit while fighting the smugglers on top of an airship. Veil told him that if he stayed, he'd be killed. So he ran, and hid. And just by luck, he ran across a secret organisation of druids, who taught him how to control his fire power. They also helped him learn an ancient Druidic secret: the ability to morph one's self into an animal form. Of course, Flamer was made of metal, so the creatures he transformed into were also metallic. But it was still a useful skill. And it was epic as heck. \n\nSo now the story truly begins, with the four members meeting up to delve into the Mines Of Madness. If you haven't run or played in this yet, you need to. It's a quest to get this philosopher's stone from a lich hidden in an insanely trapped mine. Basically a more fun version of Tomb Of Horrors. I'd run it a couple of times before, each session ending in horrific TPKs. So I was interested to see how these new guys would fare. \n\nAnd they did it. Not flawlessly, but they actually got the stone without any of them dieing. Della agreed to be killed to save the rest of the party only to turn up alive two minutes later, and Turf got turned into a gelatinous version of herself, but even that was reversed by the end of the dungeon. It was a great success. \n\nThere was a bit of a bother about what to do with the quest macguffin, which they dubbed the Forever Stone. You see, Della had put together this team under the urging of the high priest of the temple, who hadn't specified what the artefact could actually do. And finding out that it made the holder immortal, well... She wasn't exactly keen on simply handing it over to anyone, even the high priest. Not that she wanted the thing for herself, mind you: she unattended herself from it after the team finally agreed to pretend as though it hadn't been inside the mine at all, and that Dell should keep it hidden and safe. In her mind, only someone truly worthy should become an undying, and only if they were doing so for reasons other than the fear of death. \n\nSo they split up, a little older and a little wiser. Flamer went back to the druid enclave, Turf brooded about her family mansion, Lund went back to jail and, Della tried not to lie too much to her superior. They'd beaten what had never been beaten before at my table/tablet. \n\nIt was then, that I knew; they were destined for great things. \n\n* * *\n\n* * *\n\nPart 1 of many, I guess. ",

        "text": "* [&lt;&lt; previous](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/756j4w/vtmjalees_kamal_villain_by_proxy/)\n\nAfter a couple weeks passed Edvin finally had the time to seek out Rayzeel and attempt the suspire. The long version isn’t entirely relevant to the story at hand. The short version is he succeeded, and to the extent that he was forever changed by his experience - Edvin had reached Golconda.\n\nThe change was immediately apparent to any that knew him, and almost as much to any other Kindred. His blood consumption took a steep dive, his Beast was at peace, and he was freed from the bonds of Generation. For all mechanical purposes, Edvin was considered to an Antediluvian.\n\nGenerally, this is where a story would end. This would be the climax, and the rest of the story would be about how everything changed, but everything stayed the same, and one Lick in Golconda can’t really do much of anything. But this story isn’t done.\n\nThe real climax wouldn’t come for another three games.\n\nGame eighteen rolls around and a couple of months have passed since the disease was cured. The Domain was still cleaning up the fallout from it, but most everything had settled out. The leadership of the city had cataloged the dead, arranged for their wills to be executed, and their estates settled. There were fewer than expected from such a long and effective disease, but the timely turnaround of the blood banks of the city were never more lauded than those few months. The Prince even arranged to advertise them, on his own dime.\n\nThis was the first game where Edvin’s ascendance to Golconda was revealed, and it hit the others like a truck. To my surprise, John was the only one who displayed faith in my ability to pull it off. Which was unsettling, in a way. Dilton and Trev were concerned about the balance of the game, while Sabrina was… quiet. I never got a reason for her hesitancy - not one that I had full faith in, anyways.\n\nSo, as Edvin walked out into the coterie’s quarters that night, with the subtle, but obvious lifting of the weight of unlife from his shoulders, there were a number of questions going around. Edvin had only one answer to give: “We can get to that later. How is X going for you?”. A complete dismissal of the question, and then asking them about a project that they had been working. Needless to say, the characters were put off.\n\nElysium was much the same, although Edvin made a point to stand in the back and out of sight for the majority of the official ceremony. He continued his dismissive defense, and was able to make it through the night without actually answering any questions on the subject.\n\nAs the Prince spoke to the assembly, he spoke at length about what changes the city had gone through the past several months, and brought out a small marble pillar, to be placed in the foyer of Elysium, which had been engraved with the names of those that were lost to the disease. There were twenty-some names so engraved. There was a brief moment of silence, and then the Prince continued.\n\nThe Prince discussed several of the cleanup projects around the city, and called those in charge of each onto the stage to address the Domain with a status report. All of the projects were going to plan, except the few surrounding the Anarch’s territory. For some reason, any project that bordered their territory had been delayed. When those whom saw the pattern inquired, the project leaders implied that because the Anarchs weren’t keeping their members under control, the cleanup crews were having to cover their masquerade breaches as well as do their own work.\n\nThe Prince became seriously upset.\n\nAfter talking him down from abolishing the Anarch Free State of the city, King - with Thea in tow - convinced him to allow them to speak with the Anarchs and attempt to get everything sorted out. If they couldn’t do it in 3 nights, then the Prince could outlaw the Anarchs and call Blood Hunts on them.\n\nLike I said, the Prince was seriously upset.\n\nThe matters of state dispensed with, Edvin was called to the stage. He stepped up, and those assembled which knew him stared. Even the Prince could not smooth his expression fast enough to hide it from Edvin. Edvin explained calmly that he had had no other contact with the Tremere that had been in the city previously, and had begun to actively search for them in the city. He explained that he had also sent word up the chain of command, and was awaiting their reply. He then explained that that was his boon to the Prince discharged, and he could no longer speak about the private affairs of clan Tremere. Others began to question him about his change in appearance, but he ignored them, and left the stage. The Prince recovered first, and dismissed Elysium.\n\nEdvin made his way out of Elysium quickly, avoiding anyone wanting to question him, and went about arranging the business that he had pushed King and Thea into. Calls went out to his contacts in the Anarchs - the movement had grown significantly during the disease and during the following cleanup. They were now almost 30 members, a sizeable minority in the Domain. They hadn’t needed to expand their territory yet, but they had been grandstanding about the issue anyways. Edvin had advised them to get their house in order, and it seems as though they had failed to do so.\n\nAnd so Edvin made arrangements for King and Thea to meet with the Anarchs on neutral territory, to speak about the issues. Thea was thrilled, and anxious, to have such an important job, while King was suspicious:\n\n&gt;King: “Edvin, the Anarchs are kinda your thing, aren’t they? Why send us to talk to your contacts, at a meeting that you arranged?”  \n&gt;Edvin: “Because this is a priority, and I do not have a spot in my schedule to handle it in a timely manner.”  \n&gt;K: “How do you-”  \n&gt;E: “I know your schedules, dear friends, because I pay attention to what you do.” *rolleyes* “And because I actually read the shared calendar that Brain so kindly put together for us.”  \n&gt;Brain: “I’m just happy someone else uses it. A waste to make it public only to be met with silence.”  \n&gt;E: “No, Brain, it’s been very helpful, although, I notice that it doesn’t cover all of everyone’s activities. I understand the desire for privacy, however.”  \n&gt; The others look at each other.  \n&gt;Thea: “Edvin… exactly how much spying have you been doing on us?”  \n&gt;E: “None. I simply interact with you enough to form an opinion about where you go and what you do each night, and draw inferences from our talks and status reports.”  \n&gt;T: “That’s a lot of status reports to read, Edvin.”  \n&gt;E: “It takes me considerably less time to read them than it does for you all to write them, I assure you.”  \n&gt; More odd looks.  \n&gt;E: “Peace, peace. Now, to the task at hand…”  \n\nEdvin informed them of how the meeting would likely go: the Anarchs would begin in a big huff and bluster, which would be best responded to with stonewalling until they run out of steam. Following that, the Anarchs would likely try to divide King and Thea on the issues by using obfuscating and confusing language, which simply means that they will have to be aggressive and cut through the smoke and half-lies. Then, finally, the Anarchs would be open to talking about the actual problems, and probably cut the pair a bit of slack during the negotiations.\n\nHis instructions given, he left the others to talk about how to approach the Anarchs and to do whatever other prep that they needed. He left a few messages with Jalees about needing to speak in person, and then went out into the night. The negotiations went exactly as Edvin had explained that they would. King played the stoic good cop while Thea played the loose cannon bad cop, and they soon had the Anarchs agreeing to everything under the sun about what they needed to do and how to get a handle on their people and so forth. And then, for the first time, the players threw me for a loop.\n\nThey asked the Anarchs about Edvin.\n\nThe Anarchs didn’t have many beans to spill on the subject, but they had enough information that it may be difficult to find appropriate half-truths to tell the others to keep Edvin under the radar. Even worse, Lady ST clearly was waiting for this line of questioning, and had the Anarchs come forward with everything. How Edvin had made sure that they had had a solid supply of blood during the epidemic, how he had even given them some from his personal stash at times - “The ones what in the big clay pots”, and how he had gone out of his way to ensure that they knew the rules of Anarchy in a Domain, especially the bit about still needing to keep to the tradition of the Masquerade.\n\nAll of which was entirely half of the truth. Edvin had given most of them a good supply of blood, and eaten some others. He had given them blood from clay pots at times, but that was actually from Jalees’ stash, and had a whole host of thaumaturgic implications. He had beaten into their Baron the importance of the Masquerade - and the importance of knowing when to break it by having some Games of Instinct.\n\nSabrina and Dilton traded looks as I remained serene in the face of Lady ST spilling fully half of the secrets, and I’m not sure that that made them any more convinced that I wasn’t going to hopelessly take over the game. As she finished I laughed under my breath, as if laughing to a joke that only I knew I would understand. To this day I still don’t know if that helped or hindered.\n\nThe negotiations with the Anarchs complete for the night, and the hot light of day rising in the east, the group retired for the day, and waited patiently for game nineteen.\n",

        "text": "The Curse of Strahd\n\nThe six of us had planned for this evening for about a month, so of course there were two cancellations right before we started. One guy was sick. The other person’s computer apparently crashed. All of that lead to us getting started about 30 minutes late with the party two members short. I would have postponed the game, but we had already postponed from last week when a player was helping his parents move. At this point, I feared that we would never start if we kept delaying for people with last minute excuses. So we started the game without them.\n\nWe’re playing Curse of Strahd (henceforth abbreviated as CoS) over Roll20. I didn’t tell my players a lot. Two of them know that it’s an updated Ravenloft. They all know that there’s a horror theme, although I’m willing to bet that most have forgotten by now. Kind of like how they all forgot to give their characters names. \n\nThe Party:  \n - Our most experienced roleplayer is an LG human Paladin. He’s played more D&amp;D than anyone else in the group.  \n- The know-it-all who’s been roleplaying for a few months is a half-elf N Warlock.   \n- The guy who’s been roleplaying Savage Worlds for 10+ years but is new to D&amp;D is a human Fighter. He was sick, and hasn’t made his character yet. I’m sure he’s forgotten what an alignment is and will need to be poked and prodded before next week when we play again. He usually needs about 10 reminders before he does something.   \n- There’s a guy who’s played a short game of Savage Worlds and a short game of D&amp;D. He’s a LG human Cleric. He’s made his character, but his computer has died. We’ll see if he can make it next time.  \n- Lastly, there’s a guy who we all play Destiny with. He heard us discussing CoS, said “That sounds interesting” and played his first session with us. He’s a CN drow rogue. With an emphasis on Piracy. I don’t anticipate many pirate ships in CoS, but I applaud his imagination in character creation.   \n- And of course, there’s me. The DM and Strahd himself. I’d been playing and GMing Savage Worlds for about 15 years until I moved for work and left my playgroup (which contained our Paladin and Fighter) behind. I started using Roll20 a few months back as a way to play with some of the people I’d left. I Gm’d a Savage Worlds campaign and then DM’d a short D&amp;D campaign and asked my players which rules they’d like to proceed with. They chose D&amp;D, so here we are. \n\nOn to the actual game. Our heroes (well three of them) find themselves in the city of Waterdeep. A nobleman has hired them to rescue his daughter from the evil Jeromy Gride and his bandit gang. As is fitting for such an evil group, they operate out of Skull Cave in the Sword Mountains, northwest of Waterdeep. The party splits up to gather more information about the Gride Gang. The three of them learn that Gride is a pretty evil guy. He likes killing the people he robs and will probably kill this hostage even if he is paid the ransom money. Fortunately, the Pirate is able to learn the location of Skull Cave.\n\nThe group reconvened later and share info. The Pirate shared the location of Skull Cave and the Paladin told the party of Gride's evil nature. The party decided to set out immediately and so they rode off into the evening. That night, after they set up camp, a cold mist rolled in and surrounded the camp. When they wake in the morning, everything seems a bit different. They kept traveling, but couldn’t seem to find the landmarks that will lead them to the bandits’ camp. Instead, they come to the gates of a seemingly empty town. Everything is locked up and no people are out. Our Pirate tries to break into a tavern because he wants rum. The Paladin stops him and then they are all surprised by the voice of a young girl. “There’s a monster in our basement. Will you help us?”\n\nOf course they agree. The girl and her little brother are scared. If the party can’t save the kidnapped girl, they can at least help these kids. The children show the adventurers to a rather derelict looking house. The party goes inside and begin to explore the house. Despite how run down the house looks from the outside, the inside is clean and well decorated. The pirate wandered off on his own to steal some items. He liberates the owners of the house of a hand crossbow and several bottles of their best wine. The party explores the first and second floors and by all appearances the house is quite nice, if a bit vacant. But there’s no basement, which is odd because the little girl said there was. They make their way to the third floor of the seemingly abandoned house. At the top of the stairs, there’s a suit of armor which the warlock decides to investigate. He stumbles back in surprise as the armor comes to life before his eyes. It raises a fist to strike him down and...\n\n...then we cut. It’s 10 pm and everyone has work in the morning. The three present party members agree that this is shaping up to be a nice adventure, but are worried about the kidnapped girl from Waterdeep. They hope they can get back in time to save her. Perhaps when the mist is cleared they can find their way back. Everything went smoothly, and I only had to use my omnipotent DM powers once. The paladin used Divine Sense on the little girl and boy and they’re ghosts. I highly doubt the party would follow undead children to their scary house and while CoS is very open world, I can’t have my players skipping the intro. So I had his check fail. Maybe he was tired. Maybe it was Strahd. Maybe it was the house itself. Who knows? In the future, there will be plenty of opportunities for them to use their wits to avoid conflict. But for now, they’re going to the Death House.\n",

        "text": "Megamek is powerful. You know what’d be even more powerful? Megamek with the capacity for custom units. If that sounds like your jam, then MegaMekLab is for you. That was how it was pitched to me, and I couldn’t imagine one being downloaded without the other now. It feeds my crippling addiction to creating stuff. What else is good about it is that it’s impossible to cheat: you want to make a unit? You have to have MML validate it. Your tonnage needs to be right, your slots used, heat output and cooling need to be correct, and it generates a Battle Value and unit cost you must abide by.\n\n...this does mean that however high-performance and/or specialized your creations may be, they’re not always gonna pan out. This is the story of what I learned by answering the question “well, why not?” as I noodled about in MegaMekLab.\n\nMy first experiments were Solaris specials, basically, since that would be the easiest thing to throw together, right? Make mechs adept at killing other mechs without worrying too terribly much about battlefield endurance or non-mech opponents. To that end I thought I’d take a page from my the Something Awful Mechwarrior 4 Solaris Specials and make a bunch of mechs that were capable of completely bisecting other mechs in two shots by carrying the biggest guns possible.\n\nBecause I’d apparently thought I could make a better Fafnir than the official Fafnir, my first experiments included Improved Heavy Gauss, which are bigass magnetic cannons that have Gauss Rifle range...which is technically also a thing for the normal Heavy Gauss, but unlike the Gauss Rifle’s flat 15 damage all the way to an insane gun distance, Heavy Gauss does more than 20 damage close in and that starts falling off with range. You want to close in, then unload. Improved Heavy Gauss do a flat 22, so they’re more reliable.\n\n...this did not work for the dumbest reason. Essentially, I’d discovered that these guns also had some sort of recoil problem or something...vaguely similar, because when I fired both of these guns from a standing position, you know, like a Battlemech is supposed to, it flung the damn thing over onto its back. Okay, that didn’t work.\n\nFar better, though, was the Ultra Autocannon/20 that could lay down a 40-point bodybreaker from a colossal double tap and the Hyper Assault Gauss/40-wielding mech that could do the same. I called the UAC/20-slinger “The Ambassador.”\n\nThat was a simple brawler, one that didn’t require much discipline to use, just killer instinct and ammunition. Far fancier was my attempt at seeing what other weapons I could get use out of in a solo fighter, like Streak LRMs. This baby was White Line Fever, and Streak LRMs were all she used.\n\nWhat’s a Streak LRM? Well, it’s an offshoot of a Long Range Missile, normally used for rear-line artillery work by being launched in huge waves that bombard targets as long as they have a vague target to fire at. Streaks are just a little bit different: they only shoot when they’re guaranteed to hit, which means if you’re smart about their use on a mech that’s fast enough, you can pepper targets with them while you dance about. The Clan ones don’t even need to travel a minimum distance to arm themselves, which makes them even better. Now, I forget what that one was called, but hey, it proved that under the right circumstances, a single-type weapon build was totally doable for a solo arena mech. That one was fast, fragile and designed to dance about on its jump jets, leaping a good 5 or so spaces at a time, running and dancing just out of reach of opponents. With disciplined fighting it was totally possible to win arena matches this way.\n\n...then my mentor introduced me to an anime called Armored Trooper VOTOMS.\n\nVOTOMS is...imagine real robot mecha that took sort of the opposite tack to Battlemechs but feel just as real, maybe even more so because they’re all dinky and very purposeful. Instead of one 75-ton mech that’s like the size of a small house, get ten 7.5-ton mechs called Armored Troopers that are a few meters tall each and skate around on motorized rollers hidden in the feet. Arm them with rapid-fire guns and missile spam launchers that make them read like angry attack helicopters with feet and send them at opponents in bigass waves. If that sounds like a good time to you, it sure as hell did to me.\n\nI love that show, and a quick jaunt off to some sites told me what I wanted to hear - the heaviest AT in official VOTOMS media was 10 tons heavy, the lightest around 3.5. You could seriously divide a Battlemech’s weight by ten to get its equivalent AT tonnage. I thought it was perfect.\n\n...except it wasn’t. As it turns out, the weapons don’t scale down as well as the mechs do. You can get a Rotary Autocannon or an Ultra to be the machine gun that lots of ATs wield, or maybe a Light Autocannon if you’re really running out of weight to play with, and maybe one missile launcher type. Compare to the anime, where a Scopedog stops at a full-blown autocannon and a bigass shoulder-mounted missile pod if it’s packing light or standard issue. When one’s pissed off or being built by protagonist Chirico Cuvie, expect it to sprout another gun in a torso pod, maybe an oversized cannon over the shoulder Armored Core-style, and at least two other missile pods at whatever free space there is at the other hip or over the other shoulder. Guess what happens if you try that in MegaMek. And don’t think I hadn’t tried all the permutations: ATs were never the toughest things, so armor was not high on the list of priorities, but it was still fairly necessary. But even if I had one trundle into battle butt-naked, they could never carry quite enough ammo, nor carry quite enough weapons to accurately mimic what was done on the show, and at that, the heavier one of these MegaMekLab ATs got, the more immobile it became. It never squared out.\n\nThat didn’t mean I didn’t get some powerful “ATs” out of the deal when I went off-script and started building original mechs tailored entirely to my style of play. My favorites, the best performers out of them all, were the Tonbogiri series of 55-tonners (5.5 ton ATs by this really rock-stupid conversion) which used jump jets and a device called a Partial Wing to leap 8 hexes at a time, as far as it can run, with a Rotary Autocannon and missiles to back it up. Blistering skirmisher, capable of crossing damn near any terrain it ran up against and while fragile, was never meant to stand and fight...even though my mentor pointed out to me that that’s what Battlemechs are supposed to do. No wonder I had an average fight record. No, it was meant to dance and harass, and dance and harass it did, as long as its jets or wings didn’t get shot out. With careful play it could lay claim to being the nimblest medium I’d ever built that could still land a blow.\n\nActually, what was worse was the fact that I can’t really, you know, use them with anything else. The whole idea of an Armored Trooper is that it’s like seven tons of robot as opposed to seventy; they’re dwarfed by tanks and maneuver with infantry as opposed to lording ominously over them. You’re supposed to keep them away from large armored vehicles, not drive closer to them so you can hit them with your sword. If it stops being VOTOMS the minute any non-Armored Troopers show up, is it really a conversion? Yeah...no.\n\nStill, I was learning a lot. I decided to see exactly what the limits were, and went to my favorite topic first - speed. The Land Air Mech (think variable fighter from Macross, as in literally) parts didn’t exactly function, instead simply forcing you to throw plane parts like landing gear into the internal structure somewhere, so I needed to get my fix of crazy mobile mechs differently, and I knew how to get there. From my crawls of the Battletech wiki I was aware that one of, if not the fastest ground unit in Battletech proper was the Gabriel scout hovercraft, which according to the rules could move like 25 or so hexes a turn at the cost of being a flea outweighed and outgunned by most weapons systems. As in, just the guns, not the vehicles or mechs. Could I beat the Gabriel and still get a combat-usable mech out of it?\n\nThe answer was: Oh hell yes could I!\n\nSince I couldn’t build a LAM, I got creative, building a 20-tonner that went from experiment to pretty workable thing. A Land Air Mech is basically a Battlemech that can turn into a fighter, but this was a Battlemech built more LIKE a fighter. Meet Kongo (I’d wanted to name my combat-capable designs after legendary blades and ended up making so few I didn’t get out of the Japanese ones): it was built using an ultra-light composite structure (because I didn’t know that Ferro-Composite was 75% the weight of a normal internal structure as opposed to Ferro-Fibrous’ 50%, but it squared out because I had more room for stuff, 75% the space of a normal internal structure as opposed to Ferro-Fibrous’ 50%) the lightest, most powerful engine I could get my hands on, and rather than a Gabriel’s one Small Laser, a Medium Laser and two Small Lasers - the equivalent of seven Gabriels screaming about and buzzsawing into targets like a swarm of angry bees. It was decently armored, decently armed, and a full 8 hexes faster than the next fastest mech: the Firemoth, or the Dasher, or whatever you prefer to call it. Not only that, but it could jump three hexes to the Firedashermoth’s zero. In solo combat it could outmaneuver and pop a Firemoth in a dogfight. Maybe not the highest praise, but I bet it would have been even more frustrating to face than the ‘Moth for its role.\n\nHowever, that was the prelude to a truly ridiculous experiment: what was the absolute fastest mech I could build, period? For that I’d need to delve into the experimental stuff. Down the weight went to 10 tons, the lightest proper Battlemech possible. In went the biggest engine it was possible to fit, and up went the speed. On went a Supercharger, which increased engine power at the risk of blowing up the Supercharger, and up went the speed. On went MASC, which increased engine power even further at the risk of blowing up the MASC system, and up went the speed.\n\nUp it went past 30, to 50, and beyond. The fastest I could ever figure was the fastest anyone else dinking around in MegaMekLab had ever gone: 65 hexes maximum, a max speed of just a bit over 700 kilometers per hour. How fast is that? Oh...about 440 MPH, or the maximum speed in level flight of the fastest prop-driven fighters during WWII. On something with legs. Totally useless for something meant for combat, but it’s a good 20 hexes faster or so than the fastest official mech from a Technical Readout, an April Fool’s thingamajig built out of some light mech I can’t remember for illegal street racing. Sorry, pal, but real speed is purpose-built.\n\nThat did beg the question of what the hell I would use them for, but I had that covered, though I never made the map for it...I wanted to build an F1 circuit sort of thing with paved roads and everything, tracks where it was totally possible to spin out and have bad crashes in tricky corners. Trouble is, though, every mech would basically end up being the same after a while, so without any meaningful way to advance the players or make them distinct from one another I’m not sure how long the racing series would have lasted. Or maybe it would have; I haven’t tried it yet but I can just see where the cracks are. Hey, maybe I’m wrong. Maybe in playtesting this would be perfectly hunky-dory and I’d think of something, I’ve just never tried yet.\n\nFor a while, that was all I did, tinkering with my ultimate speedster. However, that’s boring and I want to shake things up a little bit. It’s probably time I got back into the game, maybe use the Protomech rules to make ATs this time around. Hell, why limit myself to the VOTOMS conversion? I haven’t even begun to experiment with all the possible play permutations. Melee-only slapfighters fitted with nothing but swords and axes? Clattering ICE-powered monstrosities for building an army of rogue construction equipment? Assaults built like Tonbogiri grown too large, hovering ominously over the battlefield like how the Phoenix Hawk IIC must be advertised in the Diamond Shark brochures?\n\n...oh yeah. Be afraid. There will be drunken stumbling back into the world of Battletech as long as I can come up with wacky Frankenmachines to inhabit it. Hell, I could make a whole other series of stories out of that, too, someday, couldn’t I?",

        "text": "***SPOILERS FOR CURSE OF STRAHD***\n\nYesterday, my neutral evil warlock became lawful evil. We were in the treasure room of the amber temple, and we found the secret passage to the three sarcophagus beyond it. We killed the vampire spawn easily through the use of our (true neutral) druid's daylight. We also had a (lawful good) revenant life cleric (with no offensive spells so she wouldn't be too powerful) , an (chaotic good) arcane trickster, as well as the npcs, (neutral good) Ismark and (true neutral) Casimir (dusk elf wizard). Before we investigated the sarcophagus Ismark told the party he loved them and trusted them and he's so glad they've come this far for him and he couldn't imagine losing us, to which I put my hand on his shoulder and told him I couldn't think of losing him either (total lie). Casimir got the gift from the resurrection god and I got the gift from what I think is the night mother (when I asked, it just kinda laughed at me). So this is when I found out I'd have to kill someone who loved / revered me, drink all their blood, and get killed by someone who hated me. The cleric had a crush on Ismark, and got jealous whenever I talked to him, so I figured these two would be my helpers. I got a good short rest in to get my spell slots back, but the cleric was out (so no revivify). Then I told Ismark I need his help for an experiment which might lessen the darkness of the sarcophagus which are now downstairs. The cleric butts in and asks what's going on, so I explain my plan and that Ismark is the right guy for the job but I'll call her if I need her (natural 20 on the deception). So I go down with Ismark, fear him into a corner, gag him, and start beating his head in with a rock. The cleric starts to go check on me but before she can get far I telepathically tell her in a calm but assertive tone, \"Prying eyes will break my concentration. Please stay above until I've called you.\" She does so, and also wards off the other members of the party when they start wondering where we've gone. After I'm done drinking Ismark's blood, I tell the cleric I need her. She tries to spare the dying. Too late. She's sad and confused, wondering what's gone wrong. I tell her that I killed him because I wanted to. I've committed a great sin. I serve Dendar, the Night Serpent, and bring living nightmares in her name. The cleric's sad confusion turns to hatred fueled rage and she starts trying to choke me with her necklace. I feign resisting and laugh maniacally as much as I can laugh while being choked to death. Right before I think my dying thought, I telepathically alert each remaining party member, \"Please come down here. I need help! Quickly!\" The whole party comes down to see the cleric standing over two, now dead party members. She realizes what I did. She tried to convince them I must be in league with Strahd, that I killed Ismark, but I've never shown signs of being evil and have always passed my deception checks to hide my evilness. She gets a 2 on her persuasion check and they proceed to cut her down. Sad and confused, they feel defeated with half of their party gone and their chances of defeating Strahd greatly diminished, some even crying over this loss. Then I wake. I confess my evil deeds proudly, knowing that as a true vampire I am powerful enough to kill all three of them. I tell them that my goal has not changed, and since we share that goal, I would continue working with them, if they would allow it. It was their best chance of beating Strahd so they begrudgingly agree. The revenant comes back as well, retrieves her things, and as she does this, Ismark's skeleton reanimated and follows her (it's part of her character that she always has a skeleton butler, and her old one recently died). She then rejoins the party. The sad and broken party. Everyone feels guilty except for me. Everyone is living their own nightmare. ",

Since we were pros by that point, meticulous planning was done before we raided the compound where his mansion was located. That planning obviously immediately went to shit at the gates.\n\nSocial engineering our way in didn't work and the gate was shut in our faces. Garuu being Garuu decided to do what he does best and tried to rip the massive metal gateway right of its mounts. And succeeded. Alarms begin to sound, guards draw weapons and the rest of the team is at least as surprised by this turn of events as the guards.\n\nOnly Garuu wasn't and deployed his \"baby\". A Vulcan Minigun with powered break-down that transforms into a troll sized suitcase and back on the press of a button. Laughing gleefully, he begins shredding the oncoming guards while the rest of the infiltration team get over their surprise and pull out their own weapons.\n\nSome unimportant clusterfucks later, they finally entered the main mansion making haste towards the panic room to pry it open, with only 2 guards being left alive (as far as their Matrix overwatch could tell). Those played it smart and waited on one of the upper staircases, popped smokes and started to hose down the team with automatic fire.\n\nFinally, after a lifetime of being intellectual insignificant, Garuu was struck with inspiration: He just needed a big enough ventilator to get rid of the smoke and his gun rotates! So he shrugged out of his coat and tied it to one of the barrels, only to have it immediately seize after spinning up again, the reinforced cloak turing the delicate machinery into a mangled mess and adding even more smoke to the environment.\n\n*****\n\nWe did finish the run with some more horrible consequences, but Garuu's part was mostly played.

        "text": "* [&lt;&lt; previous](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/743msz/vtm_jalees_kamal_villain_by_proxy_part_9/)\n\nPart 10:\n\nWe spent games nine and ten hunting down the infernalist through various means, but there wasn’t any particular drama or intrigue that went on. King had a starring role in a big way, with Brain and Miser as his wingmen. Thea and Edvin mostly played backup and cleanup crew, given Edvin’s distaste for needless violence and Thea’s rapidly worsening condition - more on that in a moment. There were a couple of scenes dealing with Edvin’s search for Golconda, but the specifics aren’t entirely germane. \n\nIn game eleven, however, everything started to go topsy-turvy. By this point, the Infernalist knew that we were on to him, and had begun to accelerate whatever vector he had used for his disease. Large swaths of the population became infected with it, but it was sloppy, the signs were easier to notice, and even the populace at large began to identify the signs. The available feeding pool shrunk rapidly, and it was only by the grace of the blood banks that the majority of the Kindred community remained adequately nourished.\n\nThe most amazing thing was that the vector affected Thea even though she hadn't drank any additional infected blood. The disease inside of her simply changed and advanced as it did in the population at large. She began to take social penalties, and then physical penalties, and just this game she took a small mental penalty as well. Edvin was completely mystified at how that worked, but he was convinced that removing the Infernalist from play would result in the disease weakening, and eventually dying off.\n\nThe Coterie, at just barely above half blood, woke for the night, and returned to what they had been doing every night for the past four weeks - hunting the Infernalist. Edvin had managed to arrange for blood deliveries to various smaller groups of Kindred in the city, and had been doing it long enough that he wasn’t looked at too much when he decided to do deliveries personally, taking along a couple of ghoul retainers. He reported the few that had the disease already, in an effort to keep others away, and he reported a few that “had the disease already” to hide his tracks. He would later report those few again as “no longer needing deliveries, as the disease had consumed them”.\n\nSheet change: +12 Diableries, +40 XP from Diableries, -1 Generation, Humanity 10, Most Attributes 5, Countermagic 4\n\nThis night, however, was slightly different. This night, he had a message from a contact around town that had been monitoring a couple of key Thaumaturgical ingredients for doing any sort of large scale distribution of a disease. The contact had narrowed down a couple of companies that had recently begun, or largely increased, their usage of these components, and sent the list to Edvin for inspection.\n\nEdvin brought this to the Coterie, and convinced them that it was of the highest priority to begin operations at once. The group was hesitant, especially with Thea, one of the two big combatants, down and out for the fight. Edvin wasn’t concerned, confident that he could shore up any issues himself. That drew some funny looks, but otherwise swayed the others to jump on the opportunity now, before the Infernalist had a chance to move his operation.\n\nEdvin and group geared up for a big fight, and it was somewhat impressive. Edvin had a small number of things that had been commissioned for him by older, bigger Kindred, among them:  \n\n* a suit of heavy chain maille painted black and reinforced with kevlar and ceramic plates (the latter had been recent additions, obviously)  \n* a sword somewhere between that of a spatha and of a traditional English longsword, thin with a hexagonal blade and a fine weighting  \n* a 10-round box magazine automatic shotgun, normally filled with 12 gauge slugs  \n* a bag of thaumic components and miscellany.  \n\nThe rest were geared in altogether more recent sorts of armor and weapons - flak jackets, kevlar vests, and firearms of various descriptions. They cast him a couple sidelong looks until he demonstrated the silence of the armor and the sharpness of the blade. The gang then mounted up in one of King’s many black-on-black SUVs and began riding down the list. About a third of the way down, the group found its target, and exhibited the naturally extreme prejudice that most hold against Infernalists.\n\nAfter kicking down the door and surprising a fair number of mortal retainers, all of whom displayed highly advanced symptoms of infection, the group slowed a bit and began to take the task of sweeping the building looking for the Infernalist seriously. They went room to room, in pairs, carefully combing every room. While they wasted time, Edvin smacked one of the retainers around and Dominated him until he spilled where the Infernalist was hiding.\n\nEdvin walked to the secret door hidden in the wall, listened against it for a brief moment, then changed out his normal magazine of slugs for a magazine of military-grade incendiary rounds. He loaded a single wall-breaching round manually, to open up the wall so that he could fire through it. Edvin carefully aimed the shotgun against the wall, stopped breathing, and then held down the trigger.\n\nThe breaching charge tore through the plasterboard wall, ripping it open in around a 20 inch diameter. The following ten rounds of incendiary ammunition shot flaming magnesium alloy particles around the small alcove, inflicting serious, aggravated wounds on anything waiting therein. Especially if what was waiting therein was a Vampire.\n\nA flaming ball with legs leapt out of the small alcove, bright green balls of fire in either hand, eyes similarly alight with an eerie lime glow. Edvin calmly reloaded, switching back to slugs now that he had gotten everyone’s attention. The Infernalist turn to him, and threw his great, sickly green globs at him, and Edvin simply stood in place and stared them down. The green flames winked out of existence a few feet in front of him, and Edvin followed them with a few aimed bursts - one to the Infernalist’s legs, and one across his shoulders.\n\nEdvin succeeded in blowing off his target’s legs, and damaging his arms enough that he couldn’t do much of anything. It was at this point that the others returned, finding Edvin standing over the burnt, legless, uselessly writhing Infernalist. Edvin quickly bent his powers of Dominate to the task of extracting as much as possible from the Infernalist’s mind about the disease and how to cure it.\n\nIn doing so, he was able to get a glimpse into the mind of the Infernalist, and glean a few important reasons.\n\n&gt;Edvin: “The Infernalist thinks that he is helping humanity by killing off vampires, himself included.”  \n&gt;King: “So what? He [fluffed] with our food source, and he [dang] well knows that there was no way this could ever end differently.”  \n&gt;E: “You don’t understand. He willingly and knowingly sold his soul to the Down Below because he thinks that Vampires are a bigger threat to humans than Demons are.”  \n&gt;Miser: “How does that make any sense?”  \n&gt;E: “Demons can’t walk the earth unless they are summoned and break loose. Vampires procreate almost as easily as humans.”  \n&gt;Brain: “That has an odd sense of truth to it. Though, most Kindred try to keep the local mortals happy and healthy, if only for their own ends.”  \n\nEdvin then said to the Infernalist: “I understand your reasons, and I think your motive was pure. I forgive you.”\n\nThe green light from his eyes snapped off, and he began to cry - not blood, but tears. Seeing that his pawn had been defeated, the demon that the Infernalist signed a pact with cursed him with a return to humanity, for just long enough that it would kill him. The infernalist died, and no one wanted to bring him back again. Edvin went to the hidden lab where the infernalist had done his work, collected his notes and use them to help devise a way to cure the disease for good, with the same virulence that the original had displayed.\n\nEdvin arranged for a proper burial.\n",

        "text": "Seven Kingdoms begins in the year 188 AC, one hundred eighty-eight years after Aegon I’s conquest of Westeros and one hundred years before A Game of Thrones begins. It has been 35 years since the death of the last dragon, but House Targaryen still reigns strong over the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros.\n\nThe year 188 marks the fourth year of the reign of King Daeron II, the mostly-admired successor of the much-hated King Aegon IV. It is the one-year anniversary of the integration of Dorne into the Seven Kingdoms proper, after the marriage of a Targaryen princess to a Martell prince. This year also marks the completion of the seat of Summerhall, House Targaryen’s magnificent castle in the Stormlands. It is a noteworthy year for the realm, which has been relatively peaceful since the end of the last war, the Dance of the Dragons, over fifty years prior. \n\nHowever, tensions still build. Dorne is still new, and favored by the Crown, increasing anti-Dornish sentiment amongst the other kingdoms. King Daeron’s bastard brother, Daemon Blackfyre, grows more rebellious after being denied a marriage to his love. Some believe him to be Aegon IV’s true heir, after being granted the Targaryens’ ancestral Valyrian steel sword Blackfyre and being legitimized upon his his father’s deathbed, and there are stirrings of support for Daemon across the realm. These conflicts and more could drag the kingdoms to violence again, or be smoothed over once and for all… \n\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n**1st moon of 188 AC**\n\n“Is it time?”\n\n“In just a moment, Your Grace.”\n\nFrom down below in the city, it would be impossible to spot the three tiny figures atop the highest of the Red Keep’s towers, standing on the iron ramparts. The castle was bathed in blackness and jutting upwards into a vast sea of stars. It was the tallest thing for leagues and leagues, and certainly the most commanding. To the west, it dwarfed the Great Sept sitting on its hill, and similarly the ruined Dragonpit to the north looked squat and unassuming in comparison. The city lay in between the three points, and sprawling outwards past them; it was nearing midnight, and lights glittered and winked like a million fireflies even at this hour, casting their muddled reflections into the waves of Blackwater.\n\nKing Daeron Targaryen, Second of his Name, looked out at it all and felt a wave of euphoria catch in his chest.\n\nIt was an uncharacteristically warm night, even for summer. Perhaps that had something to do with it, or else the wine he’d drunk earlier. He had not ever overindulged in his life, and was unused to feelings of drunkenness. Could a man get drunk on the sky? Or anticipation? Or maybe it was the feeling of the wind, stronger at this height than on the ground, whipping incessantly, invigoratingly at him. He had only himself, his two companions, a lantern, and the world up here. \n\n*This is all mine,* came a voice in his head when he looked down at it all. *No. Not mine. Ours,* he corrected himself. Up here, above the city, it was so much easier to know what his purpose was. Here he could see it all laid out, bare to him. The people, so small that he couldn’t distinguish their individual forms. The fertile lands beyond the city, and more people beyond that. The realm. It was not just a thing that plagued his thoughts every moment, it was real, and he could see it all.\n\n“Are they coming?” He cast the question behind his shoulder.\n\n“The Lord Steward delivered the messages, Your Grace,” said the patient Grand Maester Theo, pushing a pair of spectacles up his nose as he perused one of a number of large charts he was holding. “Beyond that, I know not if or when they will arrive.”\n\nDaeron tore his eyes away from the sky and the earth. “How will you know the exact moment?” he wondered aloud, peering at the diagrams of lines and dots that the Grand Maester had sketched out. “How do you know it has not already passed?”\n\n“There are old ways, Your Grace, older than the Andals or Valyria, ways lost to some but still taught at the Citadel. The ancients used stars to plan their lives, and the stars are a reliable clock. You will see the constellation of the Father line up with--”\n\nNormally he would have paid rapt attention, for if there was anything Daeron adored most it was learning of old ways and new wonders, but just then his ears pricked at the sound of footsteps on the spiral staircase below him. He turned abruptly, and saw his third companion, Ser Alyn Connington, flinch. The grizzled commander was an ever-keen watchman. Daeron chuckled and assured him with a lopsided grin that he was not about to fall from the battlements. \n\nThey arrived just in time, according to the Grand Maester’s estimate. Daeron swept forward to wrap his arm around his wife and gesture the rest all forward. Curious faces watched him carefully, no doubt confused about the notes he’d had placed under their each of their doors:\n\n&gt; *On a brand new year let us set our sights*\n\n&gt; *Atop the tallest tower, at high midnight.*\n\n&gt; *Climb the stairs and you will find*\n\n&gt; *Stars and hopes all aligned.*\n\n“Father…” a sleepy Rhaegel began, but he was interrupted. \n\n“Your Grace… it is… now.”\n\n“Now?”\n\nGrand Maester Theo nodded. “Yes. The one hundred eighty-eighth year after the great conquest has begun.”\n\nDaeron swelled. He dashed back to the battlements and peered over. \n\n“Ring the bells!” he called out, gazing down at the massive belltower, cloaked in darkness. “Ring the bells! Let all the city hear of the new year!” He gulped a great breath of fresh air. It was silly, he realized, to feel like a new year meant anything beyond what men made it to mean, but he what was wrong with a bit of silliness when he spent his days inordinately serious?\n\nThe bells rang deafeningly, sounding out for every bird and ant and sleeping peasant child to hear.\n\nHe wrapped one arm around a son, not conscious of which one it was, and one around his wife again, squeezing them both. “Ahh, a new year. And I remember the old one like it was only yesterday.” His eyes slid slyly to Mariah, waiting for her smile. And even though his sons groaned, his eyes were clear and full of pride. \n\n*Our realm. Our year.*\n\n(/u/erintargaryen - 7K's House Targaryen player)\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nWelcome folks! We are happy to tell you about our game, /r/SevenKingdoms ! \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[SevenKingdoms](https://www.reddit.com/r/SevenKingdoms/) is a new game merging between more mechanical Powers games and complete RP centric games. It encourages story-telling and advancement of characters while still having strategic game play as an element. Our game balances both roleplay and strategy elements in a way that appeals to a broad range of players. You control your House in 7K and can take them in many different directions, whether advancing their place in Westeros or challenging the status quo.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe game will begin officially Tuesday in 188 AC, several years before the canon Blackfyre Rebellion. Dorne has just entered the realm, after the failed Conquest of Dorne three decades before, bringing contentions and issues with it. Summerhall is due to open in 188 in lands taken by the Crown after House Toyne’s controversy. Not only the Dornish issue, but the ruling of King Daeron II’s father brought about debates, rising feuds, and tensions among the realm. Unlike in canon the future is not yet written and any event could or might happen from a Bittersteel Rebellion to a Second Conquest of Dorne or any number of diverting paths. Claim now to start your House’s story in the Seven Kingdoms!\n\nThe game provides many opportunities for users to take their characters and build up their stories to tell a fun and exciting tale. There are plots, intrigue, with it possible for small houses to rise to power and large houses fall from grace, as well as interactions between characters and in-depth lore. \n\nPlease look over our [Claims List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14O2L4cnd7LLAhMl9t-bPykH_QaiLyDztVvGVUZzQqzY/edit?usp=sharing) to find an open claim great for you!\n\nYou may also join us in our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/tBF4r6p) for any and all questions.\n\nFor details on the State of the Realm in /r/SevenKingdoms, you may [read through this expansive and thorough guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PWoKbGM3jCTxh_e5sYykufiDpM_Ik62xvry9MeYs4xM/edit) written by players from our community.",

        "text": "Its been a while for this one so my apologies if the particulars are a bit off for anyone familiar with this group.  Less of a story and more a collection of character bits from one of my favorite PC's.\n\nA summer camp I worked at befriended me with a group of nerds that convinced me to give up my 3.5e roots and try out a Shadowrun campaign.  We only played a few sessions, but it was a lot of fun.\n\nI decided to forego my normal mage or mage-like character and roll a frontline combative instead.  A troll seemed the obvious choice, and our GM house ruled some character gen stuff, so we rolled our attributes instead of the normal karma allocation system.  I remember rolling probably the most unbalanced crap in my life, I ended up with max starting Body, Strength, and Willpower, with mediocre in Agility and Reflex.  Everything else was god awful, the next best thing was intelligence at 2.  Yeah, I rolled 3 max rolls, a 2 and 2 1's, with like a 4 and a 5 or something for the midland ones.\n\nAnyway the thing that for some reason sticks out to me, and ended up being the core of how I played Urg, was that damn 2.  Maybe it was that it was just slightly above total crap.  Maybe it was that it was flanked by 1's on both sides on my character sheet for logic and charisma, which I would consider related.  In any case, before even finishing the rest of character generation, I knew how I wanted to play Urg.  I thought in my head, a 2 means he's just smart enough to realize exactly how pitifully dumb he is.  He's still going to do many a stupid thing, but obvious 'this is for smart people' stuff as he would put it he avoids or deals with in... other manners.\n\nWe proceed on with character gen and I make a few 'mistakes' along these lines.  The first thing is I buy a 'gun' which is kinda a loose interpretation since it's a Panther XXL.  For those of you unaware, the in book description of this weapon contains the phrase ' similar to the primary weapon in many small tanks.'  15 round clip, single shot, glorious 17 hit dice, and the reason this is a mistake is my stats make me a much more viable melee character.  The GM even calls me out on it in character generation and I simply say \"I'm metagaming here, but I have INT 2, Urg truly believes the best use of his strength is wielding a fucking huge gun.\"  The GM laughs, checks I have enough starting credits to actually buy the damn thing and then says \"carry on\".  I buy a combat knife for 'close work'.  I intentionally 'mistakenly' buy a human sized one, so it's basically a butter knife to Urg.\n\nThe next mistake is buying absolutely nothing in order to take advantage of the smartgun mod built into my personal cannon.  The GM even makes comments about this throughout the campaign.  \"Your gun's computer calculates the perfect shot, and sends it over its wireless comlinks to...  Nothing, you know nothing about it.\"\n\nI get myself some armor and basics and call it on character gen, but not before spending the majority of my leftover starting cash on a nice tailored suit, complete with pinstripes.  The dumb muscle persona is complete.\n\nWe open the game in a conference room, as we are all freelancers being hired for a job.  No one in the party knows each other in the game yet.  Urg walks in, sits in a human sized chair, and his something like 400KG of pure muscle causes the thing to collapse under him.  He stands for the rest of the meeting.\n\nThe job is to steal some files from a research computer at a rival corp across town.  Cool beans, lets do this.  Fast fowarding a bit, we're in the thick of a security alert on something like the 80th floor of this corp skyscraper.  4 guards are laid out in two rows of cubicles, their backs to the floor-to-ceiling windows, and our backs to the central support/elevator column.\n\nUrg, being a dumbass, decides this confined space, indoors, near the top of the man made equivalent of a mountain, is the perfect place to try out his assault rifle as he thinks of it.  He levels it at the nearest guard, who happens to be kinda in the middle of the room, closer to us than his three buddies in the back row of cubicles.  I don't remember what I needed to hit or what I rolled, I just remember being one off.  Crud.\n\n\"Roll damage\" the GM said.\n\n\"Uh, I missed?\" Thinking he made a mistake or misheard my hit roll number.\n\n\"Just roll it\"\n\nAnd so I did.  15/17 successes.  Almost perfect damage outta the first time I fired this cannon, and yet I missed.  Or so I thought.  The GM sighed, looked up, and said, \"The shot misses, but barrels by his head so close he's knocked out by the pressure wave of the round as it blows by him.\" I started to raise a fist and whoop before the GM just said \"HOLD ON.  The round continues, smashing into the windows behind the guards, the glass holding just long enough to set the round off.  The resulting explosion tears all the glass from that entire side of the floor and the decompression from being so high up sucks the remaining three guards out into the night air\"  He stops.  It takes a second for it to sink in.\n\n\"Dude, you just killed 4 people with one round,\" the demolitions expert of the party says to Urg.  Urg shrugged.  The beginning of an in game friendship for the rest of the campaign is born, him with his grenade launcher and budding psychic abilities, and Urg being, well essentially a tank, both in HP and in damage (when he hits).  There was a lot of mayhem outta these two.\n\nFinally we reach this computer, and our hacker goes to town on it.  Urg gets bored and starts wandering the floor, as a new security team hasn't climbed all the way up the building yet.  There's a few minutes.  He stumbles into the CEO's office and briefly looks around, pocketing a few shiny things on the shelves and such.  There's a big comfy chair, and its one of the few designed for humans that Urg can actually sit in without breaking it seems.  He tries a password or two on the CEO's computer before giving up.  Then I kid you not, I couldn't decide if Urg would be smart enough to do this, so I friggen flipped a coin on whether or not I would do it.  I 'won' my coin flip and decided that Urg was smart enough to realize if he couldn't crack the computer, the computer could always come with him.  \"The files are in the computer\" he says, as he unceremoniously rips the damn thing out of the desk, not even bothering to turn it off first.\n\nWe complete the mission, and Urg takes his computer to the only contact he has listed as \"Smart guy J0H4na$\" in his address book.  J0H4na$ is a high level hacker, and so he cracks the computer open.  He siphons what credits he can outta accounts that won't be traceable and gives the whole sum to Urg, keeping corporate secrets and other information as his own payment.\n\nDemoman learns to pilot with his new karma from the mission, Urg gets more Urg-gy (more attributes in Body IIRC).  Urg spends a good chunk of his now small fortune purchasing a hover dropship/tank thing.  He puts his own name on the lease but hands the keys to Demoman.\n\nFast forward past a few missions here, stopping to catch Urg chucking a desk at a police car in one (it got totalled), and holding a businessman up by the back of his collar while he flails unsuccessfully trying to land a blow on Urg in the next, and Demoman gets captured by this psychic cult group, believing he is a prophet or some crap because he 'fulfilled a prophecy' during one of our missions.  Party gets wind of his location through one of our contacts that's been handing us jobs, and we go into this base compound kinda thing out in the middle of the jungle.  One guard tower takes an Urg directed howitzer round and ceases to exist and the other's guard is silenced by a sniper round from our hacker.  We fight our way into the main compound, and end up on the opposite side of a vault wall from Demoman (he sensed and then contacted Urg telepathically through the wall).\n\n\"I punch the wall, attempting to break through\"\n\n\"Its rebar reinforced concrete with steel plating covering it\" - GM\n\n\"I'm too dumb to know what that means, all I know is there is a wall between me and my friend.  I keep punching the wall.  Actually scratch that I go into a rage and then punch the wall\"\n\n\"*sigh* roll damage\"\n\nThis is how I circumvented like 60% of a base without realizing it.  We ended up fighting most of it anyway to get Demoman his launcher back after we sprung him through the troll sized hole.  He actually wanted to leave it but Urg insisted it be retrieved.\n\nUrg's finest moment of roleplay though in my opinion was when he got pissed enough to hurt himself pretty severely, just to get revenge.  You see, as mentioned previously, Demoman and Urg were pretty good friends.  This probably doesn't do it justice though, they were more like blood brothers, a relationship forged by battle and the joy of being in it, as well as the surety of the other having your back.  The moral of the following story is don't fuck with Urg's friends.\n\nThe cult we bloodied getting Demoman back didn't like us taking their messiah back.  They hired a team of hitmen, but they were really little more than gang-bangers, so they didn't pay too much attention to the whole \"hey don't kill our saviour\" part of the contract.  They did a drive-by and ended up hitting Demoman with more than a couple of bullets.  He's bleeding out on the sidewalk, and our street-samurai/medic starts trying to stabilize him.  Urg goes full rage mode immediately, and sprints after the car.\n\nThey pull over about a half block down.  Mistake number one.  Urg fires his artillery piece from about 20 ft away and obliterates one of the 4 that hop out of the car.  The driver immediately fails his will save at seeing his comrade turn into chunks of meat, and starts trying to climb back in and start the car.  Mistake 2. Sniper/Hacker takes out numero 2, and Urg leaps over the whole car in one bound to land ON TOP OF number 3 guy.  400 Kilos of enraged troll hitting a dwarf from about 6 ft in the air...  He was knocked out on impact.\n\nDriver slams his foot down and the car starts shooting away.  I make a reflex save, nail it, and slam my combat butter knife into the damn driver side door.  Make a strength check, nail it cause I'm a friggen troll, and start getting dragged with the car, down the street, at 45 MPH, hanging onto a knife embedded in a door whose handle doesn't even make it halfway across my palm.\n\nDriver makes a hella risky skill roll, but ends up making it, and rolls the car over the centerline, aiming to nail Urg with an oncoming car, while skeeving by safely himself.  Urg wants none of that shit, and levels his Big 'Friendly' Gun at the driver, from about a foot and a half away, and pulls the damn trigger.  Don't even roll to hit, the GM says, you just roll damage and you both take it at this point.\n\n12/17 successes.  Driver's head and a significant portion of the vehicle's ceiling cease to exist and car slumps off back into its normal lanes from the force of the explosive round.  Urg gets tossed into oncoming traffic, gets hit by a scooter for an additional 4 damage and then crawls off the street while traffic stops to allow him to do so (fucking Vespas).  From full to 2 HP in the span of about 2 in game seconds, but worth it for revenge.  Demoman and Urg spend a good amount of time in the hospital together and go on to have many more and often explosive hijinks.",

        "text": "So my desktop bit the dust a few years ago, and I hadn't been able to play Skyrim for quite some time. When I got access to a decent computer recently, I decided to mod it up properly this time and make it the best Skyrim it could be. This has gone horribly right.\n\nRelevant mods to this story: Live Another Life, Frostfall, Realistic Needs &amp; Diseases, Hunterborn, and Requiem. \n\nAfter a week of meticulous searching, downloading, installing, tweaking, and fixing of installs, I finally have Skyrim ready to go. I wake up in a cell with a statue, as LAL do, and through the magic of Race Menu, Fine Face Textures for Men, Slof's Skyrim Eyes, and Apachii I manage to make [a Dunmer who doesn't look like a potato that's been smashed with a bag of rocks](https://imgur.com/zbplI9Y). \n\nThe first two hours of my playtime down, I finally come to the point of choosing my alternate start. Well, as I'm a Dunmer, \"Just got off the boat [Raven Rock]\" seems perfect. \n\nSo I wake up in an abandoned building, surrounded by booze (nice, thirst won't be a problem at least), with miner clothes, a magic necklace, an iron sword, and about 100 gold to my name. One of the things Requiem does is give me three free perks to make up for it making it harder to level, so I happily take my perks and distribute them as I think fits the type of social manipulator thief-mage he is destined to be. 1 to Sneak, 1 to Speech (bartering will definitely come in handy), and 1 to Illusion (Charm Person, sweet!).\n\nWe can probably agree that this would be an... *interesting* build in the best of games.\n\nI leave my shack and go exploring. I notice I get cold, but I stay more or less in town and warm my hands by torches so the fact that I don't find any cloaks doesn't bother me. I steal a blue robe from somewhere; what sort of smooth-talking mage would wear common miner clothes? I harvest a metric ton of trama root and ash yams. I venture out and harvest oysters for pearls. This is good for my hunger, my alchemy skill, and my purse. Life is pretty okay. I buy some lockpicks, because of course I do. There goes most of my money. I find the ship to Skyrim, but it costs like 350 gold, and why would I want to cut short my time here so quickly anyway? It's not like I'm the Dragonborn or anything. \n\nI talk to people and get a quest to return an ancient pickaxe from a mine. This should be okay for a level-one con artist to get some experience from. If you're not aware, Requiem is an overhaul which essentially de-levels the entire world, so that it doesn't start easy and scale up with you, and in some ways nerfs your character. A simple mine delve should be a good test of that. \n\nI get horribly killed by a Frostbite Spider. I decide not to do that again. \n\nI find these weird people working on some standing stones outside of town and no one can tell me anything about them. All right... I think I'll avoid that for now. I have learned my limits at the moment. I find the Temple instead. Ah, it reminds me of home... except the priest tells me outsiders don't belong and I'm not welcome there, which seems a [littl](https://imgur.com/wi56UGj)e o[ffensive](https://imgur.com/EOSh6OW). Insulted on behalf of my once noble house, I lurk around until he goes to sleep and steal the gems and money from the shrines. Boethiah will understand, right? Yeah... I do feel a little bad, so I leave Hir most of my trama root.\n\nWhile I'm out exploring the walls, I gain another level of tiredness. Another thing Requiem does is set your default carry weight to 100, and add weight to gold, so with everything I've gathered and the food and drink I've ~~stolen~~ hoarded today I become over-encumbered. Obviously it's time for bed. I painstakingly trudge my way back to my shack.\n\nNow, remember how I said my computer had kicked the bucket a few years ago? It turns out that while I've owned Dragonborn since shortly after it came out, I've never actually played it, and I had more or less managed to avoid spoilers. So you can imagine my surprise when I wake up to find myself chanting in response to an ominous voice in my head while I chisel at a standing stone in the snow.\n\nI manage to extricate myself while I'm freaking out and get my bearings, and take stock of my situation.\n\n[I use iHUD, so this is what my screen looks like.](https://imgur.com/tKYb5sX) No compass, no quest markers, no map markers. All the status bars (health and such) are invisible until they're needed. I am growing painfully familiar with my exposure meter.\n\nI use a no-map-markers mod, so [this is what my map looks like until I discover things](https://imgur.com/Zk1WaVv). I have a marker for myself and Raven Rock, though, and I see they are on the opposite ends of the island.\n\nFrostfall is set to kill me on too much exposure. I am wearing blue robes, miner boots, and leather gloves. \n\n\"But Eronyth, you can make a campfire!\" you might say. No friend, I cannot. ^\\(Well, ^actually ^maybe ^I ^could ^have, ^but ^I ^didn't ^realize ^it ^because ^I ^didn't ^read ^carefully ^enough.) A fire requires kindling, which I have none of, and I am concerned that using the powers to search for wood would raise my exposure too high, because they take time, time where I am sitting outside in the snow in my blue robe.\n\n\"But Eronyth,\" you say, \"you can craft a robe or a cloak from Cloaks of Skyrim or Winter is Coming! And you can make a tent or a sleeping roll with Campfire!\"\n\nWell I would love to, friend, but I have Hunterborn installed, and I have not managed to actually buy a hunting knife at this point, which means I cannot skin any animals. And I haven't seen any animals that can't kill me anyway.\n\nAnd I am still a level one ponce whose highest skills are Sneak and Destruction, but who has only one spell: Charm Person. \n\nWearing a blue robe, on the north end of Solstheim. \n\nI find my way to the Skaal village and get into a house for warmth. That's something. But I cannot sleep in a bed that isn't my own. New Quest: make my trek back across the island to my shack before I become too exhausted to live, or carry anything. Or at least find an unowned bed. \n\nSo I loot as much food and drink from the Skaal as I can (they're too busy chanting to mind), gird up my loins, and head out. I'll follow the coast. At least it's not snowy mountains. Also maybe there are fewer wisps or bears or sabrecats to kill me. They have sabrecats here, right? \n\nI find a couple dead people - bandits? pirates? skaal? This is concerning development, because obviously something killed them, and they were better fighters than I am, probably. But I sacrifice my fashionable blue robe in favor of their armor, and grab a crossbow and bolts from them. Now I'm overencumbered again, so I have to make a decision. I need food and drink to live, armor to live, and a bow is better for my continued survival, so I leave my sword behind and take a dagger so at least I have a hand weapon if I need it. \n\nI sneak away in case whatever killed them is still around. I hear a Nirnroot. Sweet! [There's a scary black thing hanging over it.](https://imgur.com/SvyZMio) I freak out a little, but it hasn't seen me, so I take a chance and shoot it. That only alerts it to me and barely damages it. I panic and run away while it shoots magic at my back.\n\nThere are horkers on the coast. The only thing that saves me from them is that I have SkyTEST installed - finally something doesn't want to kill me when I give them enough space. They could though.\n\nThere's a building that looks cool on a smaller island off the coast, but I'm fairly concerned that swimming in the Sea of Ghosts would kill me, and even if it didn't what's over there would kill me. I make a mental note for later and don't go there.\n\nThere are some people. I am concerned they'll be violent, so I sneak close, but they're just having an argument about getting back to their meadhall. I eavesdrop around the fire, eat and drink, and look for an unowned bed because the day is half over and I'm concerned about sleep. No luck. Have to keep going. I survive a troll by luring it back down for them to kill, but without a hunting knife I can't do anything with the body anyway, so they can have it. \n\nThere are Reiklings in their meadhall. I start up there, but I get chased by a bear and panic and run away. Maybe not. I keep going down the coast instead. \n\nThere are Dwemer ruins. I spit in their general direction and give them a wide, wide berth. \n\nMore standing stones. I train my sneaking by watching the thralls work.\n\nI see Telvanni mushrooms, and my heart is lifted. Home! Ish, anyway. Then I get concerned that there is something there to kill me, so I sneak around it instead. Silt Strider! Fuck yeah, take me out of here! Oh, it's too old to travel. I use its owner's fire to get warm, then it's back to sneaking. The rumbling of the volcano unsettles me deeply.\n\nAsh Spawns kill me every time I try to cross the [river and ash area](https://imgur.com/tKYb5sX). I decide not to do that anymore.\n\nEventually I sneak up to the Telvanni mushrooms and realize they are not violent, and I find a place to sleep in the kitchen. [I can go back to my blue robe](https://imgur.com/dcIZDNA). I guess I live in Tel Mithryn now.\n\nIn summary: \n\n~8 hours playtime  \n2 in-game days  \n6 deaths  \nstill level one  \n[now fully aware that Boethiah does not appreciate trama roots](https://imgur.com/Qk2fd0K)\n\n**TL;DR: Requiem + Frostfall + starting in Solstheim without knowing about it beforehand + Needs + clean HUD and map + surprisingly, Hunterborn = being lost, confused, and alone in a world that wants to, and easily can, kill you.** I've honestly never felt the thrill of a scenario that felt so unwinnable in Skyrim before, and I'm liking it.",

        "text": "* [&lt;&lt; previous](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/72wl5l/vtm_jalees_kamal_villain_by_proxy_part_8/)\n\nSheet Change: Humanity 9\n\nIn game seven, I decided that Edvin had spent enough time sitting around and was ready to jump on some lower generation NPCs and eat their hearts. Before we get to that story, however, I need to come clean with you all. Edvin’s had another goal for the game. Other than upstage King, smack him around a bit and see to realigning his play style with one that is more cooperative, Edvin has been on a mission. A mission from God. Edvin is searching for Golconda.\n\nAnd before game eight started, it found him.\n\nGolconda is a state of being for a vampire where he is no longer subject to the Beast, or otherwise his human and Beast aspects are in harmony. Saulot, the originator of Clan Salubri, was the first to achieve Golconda, and passed it down unto his Clan, many of whom became teachers of Golconda. When Tremere diablerized Saulot, the Salubri were hunted, driven into hiding. Clan Tremere set about erasing much of the Golconda lore that was spread, and most in the modern nights treat it as a myth.\n\nEdvin heard it from the horse’s mouth, in a sense. Clan Tremere was small when Edvin was Embraced, and those few that were thought to show promise were given an audience with the Council of Seven. Tremere himself attended, and sent the others out of the room to speak with Edvin alone. Saulot, having attached his soul to Tremere’s, had a brief window to take control and did so to speak with Edvin. Saulot told him of Golconda, and spoke to him of sources that would teach him, if he could find them and convince them of Saulot’s existence.\n\nMore than eight centuries later, where the wildest of the Wild West once lay, Edvin found the last piece of information that he needed. Or rather, it found him. While Edvin was out and about in the seedy underbelly of society, seeking materials for his thaumaturgic needs, Edvin had the sudden paranoia that he was being watched, and being followed. He continued about his business, then ducked into a shop and waited. A hand gripped him on the shoulder, and a terrible pain spread across his body. In the window he saw the woman behind him, her third eye alight and shining.\n\nEdvin: “Stay your hand, Lady Rayzeel! I come on orders of Saulot!”  \nRayzeel: “Silence, Tremere. You are a pitiful pawn, and you shall pay for your sins.”  \nE: “Lady Rayzeel, I come on orders of Saulot. Saulot lives, his soul bound to Tremere.”  \nR: “You lie. Tremere drank of Saulot’s heartblood, and Saulot is no more.”  \nE: “I assure you, Saulot lives. Eight hundred and sixty years, four months and seventeen days ago, I spoke with him on the night of my Embrace.”  \n\n\nAt this point, Rayzeel released her grasp on Edvin, her face focused in discerning Edvin’s lie. Edvin wasn’t lying.\n\nE: “Rayzeel, childe of Saulot, renown for your gift of song, I bring you words from Saulot: ‘Speak unto this vessel, daughter mine, and set him on the true path to Golconda. Do my will unto him, as I did unto you.’”  \nR: “He lives. No other could tell you those things. Come with me, we have much to discuss.”  \n\nRayzeel gave him the Cliff’s Notes version of the path to Golconda, and turned him loose, entreating him to come back when he was ready to attempt the suspire, the one chance at achieving Golconda. Edvin waited outside for a few minutes, and then turned around to go back inside. Rayzeel surprised him by being right behind the door. “Not tonight. You would not make it tonight.” was all she said before shutting and locking the door.\n\nAnd so, Edvin stewed.\n\nEdvin returned to the haven, and had a brief chat with the others. He talked at them about wanting to correct the disease that was afflicting the city, but couldn’t find solid ground to start on. He talked at them about his weariness of long unlife, and his weariness of the politics and cloak-and-dagger of Camarilla life. He talked at them about how they had made him feel actually welcome, something he’d not been in a long time. He talked at them for a while, thanked them, and went to his lab to try and figure out what exactly pissant disease was affecting his friend.\n\nThe others weren’t quite sure what to make of this, and talked amongst themselves about what could have brought about this sudden emotional dump.\n\nKing: “What the [fluff] was that about?”  \nMiser: “He’s taking this thing with Thea hard. He’s already put a bunch of effort into figuring out what’s going on, and he doesn’t feel like he’s any closer to an answer.”  \nBrain: “Maybe. More likely I think that the weight of years is getting to him the most. Always running from those pursuers, losing all of his childer, having to bend to the will of Prince after Prince after Prince, and all of them younger than he is.”  \nMiser: “Has anyone noticed that Edvin’s been looking more human lately? His skin seems less pale, and his aura has been saturating over the past few weeks.”  \nKing: “No, I hadn’t noticed. He did seem to be oddly emotional just then. Something strange is going on, and I’m not thrilled for it. Any time he starts doing weird [silly], dumb things start to happen around us.”  \nMiser: “There is some sort of strangeness that I feel from him. Like he’s on the precipice of something, and he’s eyeing the edge with excitement.”  \nKing: “That’d be just his style, wouldn’t it?”  \nBrain: “No. If he’s waiting for something big, it’s something that he’s already actively working towards. Either he’s more frustrated that we can tell about not solving this disease business, or there’s something from his past haunting him.”  \nKing: “Maybe… Did we ever do any checking into that story of his about being pursued for centuries by some group of things?”  \nBrain: “No, we didn’t.”  \nKing: “We should, then, and soon.”  \n\nThe three stooges looked into Edvin’s past for the rest of the night, checking and triple checking everything that he had ever said, and came up with a few contradictory threads. Most of them resolved after careful review of the grand picture, but a couple of things stood out: They couldn’t find anything that could have been related to the supposed group that was hounding his heels, and they couldn’t find any history that he had in any Camarilla Domain between 1700 and 1924. Both Brain and King had considerable contacts amongst the Kindred community, and while some of them could place Edvin somewhere before 1700, and after 1920, there was a complete gap in between.\n\nThat was quite concerning to them, and they ventured into Edvin’s lab around 3 a.m., looking to ask him about his whereabouts during that period of time. As they got to his door, Edvin threw it open and exclaimed that he had good news, and that he had bad news. King wanted the good news first, and Edvin told him that he was successful in tracing the origin of the disease. Miser wanted the bad new, and Edvin’s response was exactly what he didn’t want to hear.\n\nDark Thaumaturgy.\n\n“Dark” Thaumaturgy, officially, is any Thaumaturgy learned from demons. In practice, it’s much worse than that. There are a couple of Storyteller options for using Dark Thaum that have come out in various books, but mostly it boils down to this: Those who learn Dark Thaum are on the clock, and when time runs out they’re demon food. The demon now runs the character’s unlife, and it never ends well for the character.\n\nWhenever Dark Thaum is introduced as a plot device, I, as a player, get squick real quick, because I know that something bad is coming. The price of the quick, easy and cheap power that is Dark Thaum is the Sword of Damocles over their head, in a very real way. At any point in time, if the character is sufficiently deep in the hole to the demon, or acts against them too often, the character can be dragged off to Hell. Permanently. There is something worse than that, though. Something that has a far bigger impact on the game, and something that Storytellers often use as a big reveal of the Big Bad - the demon takes the character’s body for a ride.\n\nSo when, late that night, Edvin kicked open the door and started yelling, fear-filled, about how Dark Thaumaturgy is the only thing that hasn’t been ruled out, and that the Prince needs to assemble the Domain at once to inform them, the others did the only thing that they were absolutely sure was okay to do:\n\nPanic.\n\nThe rest of the coterie, having considerably less knowledge about what exactly is feasible via Dark Thaum, began to secure their holdings - King and Miser began to call around to their mortal herd, retainers and so forth to instruct them to hole up somewhere for a couple of days and be safe, Brain started to spread word through the Nosferatu Underground, and Thea curled into a ball and wept. That last one is particularly bad, because Kindred weep blood, something that Thea was already having a difficult time keeping in her system.\n\nEdvin called around to all of the Primogen, and the Prince, and with the first rays of light creeping into the sky, they decided that tomorrow was as soon as would be feasible to get anything done. He put a couple of calls into his contacts to have them double check their work, and left a coded message for Jalees to see if it was possible for him to provide any assistance towards hunting down the Infernalist.\n\nIt was the beginning of a long month of investigation, interrogation, hunting the infernalist, and cleaning up its mess.\n",

        "text": "So, recently I decided to do a small experiment with my cousin, someone who's been a good chunk of his life playing vidya (he gave me my first videogame lol), make him do a full playthrough of DS1. Here you have some reports of his experience in this wonderful game.\n\n**A (not so) rough start**\n\nWe created his character, warrior with master key, nothing to fancy; anyway, he first has some trouble with the controls (mostly because he isn't used to play with xbox controller), but he will get a good grasp of them on Tauro. He escaped asylum demon quite quickly, I was expeting him to die atleast once trying to kill him with the broken sword. He almost missed his shield if it wasn't for me to insist to backtrack to pick it up (hey, I'm not gonna help him, but having a shield is minimum). That part until the boss was quite usual, nothing to comment there. Most people do the fall attack quite easily, right?\n\nHe doesn't, the first time he misses completely and gets ultimately trashed by the demon, second time he does the attack right, but still loses to him. Fortunately, he manages to beat him at the third time (\"A la tercera va la vencida\", as we spanish say). And then we proced to firelink shrine.\n\n**From shrine to trash**\n\nHe levels up some VIT and STR, as he believes to be quite necesary (he is not wrong), and then we proced to new londo. He goes to the ruins and NOPEs the fuck out when he sees the first ghost. Wise decision. When then march towards Valley of Drakes, when he pick up the Astora's Sword, to be jumpscared by the undead dragon, getting him killed. He decided that retrieving the souls wasn't worth the trouble.\n\nAfter this unfortunate encounter, he finaly decides to continue, and goes to Undead Burg, using 4 estus with the hollows on the way (the ones on the shrine). He takes the alternate path on the burg, picking up the Trash and getting gangaraped by naked hollows. Ouch.\n\n**Is my Zwei not as tough?**\n\nSo, after the gangrape, he decides to explore the rest of Firelink, looting petrus stuff (fuck that guy, seriously), and heading towards the cementery, to wich he runs away upon seeing that his weapons are almost useless against the sketons, but I tell him that if he rushes the area he could get some cool loot. He rushed and gets the Zwei and the winged spear. He falls in love with the zwei, but is saddened when he finds out he doesn't have enough strenght to use it; but at least his long sword stills works. Anyway, he heads to the burg, when he gets scared when the drake lands on the bridge. He manages to get to the bonfire quite fine, but I still have to remember him to block.\n\nHe has a lot trouble to just get to the tower, but on the 5th death he has most stuff grasped, and is able to get to the boss quite easily. Buuut he decides to go downwards instead, meeting with [can't_stop_the_rock.jpg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pURJDToKA0k&amp;ab_channel=Mcrxwolf), getting him instakilled, the same goes with the black knight. He will take them out later, when he has better understanding of the controls and how to parry.\n\nHe finally goes to Taurus's fight, taking almost 50% of this health at the first try; [very good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTLtFDkyryI&amp;ab_channel=MEMES), to be honest. 2nd try he uses the resin, leaving Tauro at one hit. Ouch. He stood up of the chair in fury, welcome to the true dark souls experience, bro. At 3rd try he takes Tauro out, using a resin again. Keep in mind he did it without the fall attack on the tower.\n\nLater we meet SunBro, and he seems to like him quite a bit (who doesn't?), and levels his strenght to 24, wielding the sacred Zweihander aka. The Bass Cannon.\n\nWe stopped playing at this point (because it was 0:30). Tomorrow (today?) will continue, this time to the Gargoyles. Wish him luck!\n\n\nBTW, [here](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/318343049484828672/363784883232964609/IMG_20170930_223040.jpg) you have a picture of him playing.",

During the previous session, Barlowe came into a pretty nice magic sword made of what appears to be solid Voidstuff, it can cast darkness in a small field and also gives me darkvision, decent stuff for an 8th level character.\n\nSo as we are exploring the ruins of an old castle, we come across a room with a summoning circle on the floor. Unfortunately the demon that was trapped here wasnt too happy with us disturbing it and attacked us. Barlowe, being from a magically oriented family, immediately recognizes it and swings down at the basalt floor with the sword to cut a gouge out of the basalt floor. He makes an attack against it.\n\nNatural 20.\n\nOur GM then rolls a hardness check to see if my sword shatters.\n\nNatural 20.\n\nWe both just kinda look at each other. He then tells me to pick High or Low, and of course I go High.\n\nNatural 20.\n\nHe consults a few sheets, rolls a few more dice, then has us all roll Reflex saves, which thank GOD we passed, because here's how it played out.\n\nWhen I struck the stone, the sword shattered and the void power combined with the summoning circled opened up a massive portal to the abyss that sucked in the circle, the demon, everything currently in the room, and ALMOST 4/7ths of our party.\n\nThe sword's blade then reformed and, even though it was a shadow, it was glowing.\n\nBarlowe named it Bright Shadow, and it not only can cast darkness but also has permanent daylight eminating from the sword blade, and allows the wielder to add 1d4 to any attack AND damage roll made with the sword 4 times a day.\n\nAnd that is how I accidentally created an artifact.",

        "text": "Our story begins, as most do, with our heroes. The elf Willem Van Helsing, the old man assimar named Tower, and the ancient little Wyrwood called Rizzo are attending their little town's impromptu wolf hunt after a surge in attacks on livestock.\n\nThe townsmen are sent out in groups of three into the Dark forest at night to track and kill the wolves. The elf Van Helsing was nearly killed, and the other two took him back to the village to find a mob outside the town hall, and the players took part in chastising the mayor for organizing a wolf hunt at night, with no idea how many there were. \n\nTower took charge for a few days and converted the town hall into a hospital, for there were many hunters wounded. The town smith, Gregor, had even lost a leg.\n\nThe first night, everyone living in and around the town suffered a nightmare about being chased through the dark forest. While chatting with the town healer, Agatha, the party discovered that she makes dolls of all the children in the town and keeps them in her house.\n\nThe second night, rumors abound of the Widow Proctor, saying that a ghost had been seen at her home during the night.\n\nWith the mayor locking himself in his chambers, it is up to the party to investigate. They find the dementia-ridden widow in her home, all the furniture had been turned over and a cleaver swung from a rope in the ceiling. In her bedroom, the letter \"A\" had been carved in one of her pillows.\n\nThe old widow described a dream she had of her dead husband visiting in the night, and the two of them going on a walk through the town. She doesn't remember anything else.\n\nOn the third morning, Goodwife Vidraru came crying and screaming to the town hall. Her little girl, Annie, had disappeared in the night. No windows or doors were unlocked.\n\nThe party investigated the house. They found that the little girl's bed was made, and that one of the windows could be pushed open from the outside. A music box was under the bed, and it seemed far too expensive for anyone in a farming village to own, except perhaps Widow Proctor. A man's bootprint lay under the swinging window.\n\nThe town smith, Gregor, was the first suspect, as he had himself installed the windows and locks. There had been rumors before the hunt that Gregor sometimes stared into windows at night, one of the reports came from the missing girl. \n\nThe smith was hesitant, but revealed he had been suffering terrible dreams of standing in a pumpkin patch, and when he woke he always found himself somewhere outside. He revealed that Goodwife Vidraru had asked him about fixing the window, but hasn't gotten around to it yet. \n\nThe party went back to the town hall, where Van Helsing's wife was comforting the grieving mother. Upon questioning, she revealed that she had forgotten the faulty lock and that she had never seen the music box before in her life. In fact, Annie's only toy was a doll of her likeness that the healer Agatha had given her when sick.\n\nFurious, Tower led the party to Agatha's hut, where they found her crafting a new doll in Annie's likeness. The old woman explained that she makes the dolls because she never had children of her own, so she looks after the village children. She never gives the dolls away, but Annie had been a dying girl, and she gave away the doll as an act of kindness. She had, however, seen the music box in Widow Proctor's tearoom the last time she was there. \n\nWith no other leads, the party decided to trust in the dreams. Only one farmer in the village grows pumpkins, so they marched out to meet him. Farmer Alex Zarovich had been about to run into town himself, for he had found blood coating on of the tree stumps on his property. The party discovered quite a few things. Hair scattered in the pumpkin patch, bloodied daggers hidden in a tree, the doll, and a bloody child's handprint on a fence.\n\nThey showed Zarovich the music box, and mentioned \"the lady\", which was a name they heard when playing the box. He became enchanted and described a beautiful pale lady who danced in his pumpkin patch when the moon was full. Tonight being a full moon, the party decided to set an ambush. They disguised Rizzo as a scarecrow, hid Tower in a bale of hay, and put Van Helsing in the farmhouse window with Zarovich.\n\nThe Lady came to the pumpkin patch, staring sadly at the bloody stump. \n\nShe saw Van Helsing, and wrought an enchantment about him. He felt compelled to come closer, closer, closer...\n\nA child screamed out in the forest. Annie! The party attempted to slay the White Lady, but she now held Van Helsing hostage.\n\n\"If you pursue me, you will never find her. She will come home tomorrow.\"\n\nAnd she laid a kiss on Van Helsing's neck, leaving her mark.  ",

Fond of alcohol, not so fond of furries.\n\nAdmir, aka Darth Forest Gump, Half-Elf Paladin. 8 Intelligence, but at least he has good intentions, I think?\n\nThe party arrived at the town our escort mission set out from at noon, and had about 8 hours to kill before the merchant we were hired by set out overland. Most of the party elected to use this time to study runes, train at the local academy, or shop. Except for Gottlieb and Admir.\n\nGottlieb was bored easily, and having done all his preparation at the guild hall before arriving in the city and having been a tinkerer and artificer in his youth, spent a short while creating Bender, an automaton designed to fetch beer from the bar, and a music box with a pyrotechnic display that played a tune curiously close to a certain song by Dragonforce; armed with these, he proceeded to enter the city tavern and get absolutely sloshed.\n\nMeanwhile, Admir decided suddenly to forego his original Chaotic Good alignment and the \"good\" deity in the homebrew's pantheon in order to adopt an \"ends justify the means\" train of thought and find and offer his services to the local organized crime ring, who give him a simple order - there is a man at the docks offering free one-way boat rides to the other continent to the north of the city, as well as giving them a mysterious white powder. Eliminate the drug smuggler, and the crime syndicates of the city will bow to you.\n\nFast forward two hours. The music box had entertained bar patrons so much that it inspired them to purchase more drinks than usual, Bender the automaton kept the bar busy, and Gottlieb was very, very drunk. And in this raucous state he noticed something off - sitting in the back corner of the tavern was a young lady who didn't seem to be too happy. A sober person would have talked to her and possibly offered aid. Gottlieb, however, determined that she was in fact a closeted furry after a quick perception check. So, naturally, his first reaction was to smite.\n\nMeanwhile at the docks, our slightly mentally impaired half-elf had concocted a brilliant plan. He was going to take the old man up on his offer of a free trip and board the ship, and then convince him to give up the trade while on the ship. Step one - completed without a hitch. Step two - a few hitches.\n\nHe first tried to persuade the old man to give up the drug trade and swim back to shore, which doesn't quite work when the NPC can't swim and your best argument is \"some shady assholes told me to tell you to knock it off\". So after a short panic, the logical next step was of course to pick up the old man, heave him twenty feet into the water in full view of the harbor, and then fail at turning the sailboat and capsize it, sending Admir into the water while wearing heavy armor.\n\nBack at the tavern, Gottleib had spotted his prey - an innocent furry. He snuck (stumbled drunkenly) up to the table, prepared himself mentally for the thrill of ridding the world of an unclean entity, projectile vomited, and promptly aimed at the wrong one of the two he was currently seeing, accidentally destroying Bender. The tavern mourned, but only for a moment, and he lined up a second attempt at cleansing the world with a searing smite aimed at the same furry he'd missed before. However, being so, so incredibly drunk, he managed to miss once more, destroying the tavern's entire alcohol supply, and catching the whole damn place on fire. \n\nGottleib was fucked.\n\nAdmir crawled back ashore, having dumped his heavy armor in the ocean to save himself, to find himself face to face with half the city. The mob explained to him that not only was the man helping people escape the dictatorship of the city, but that the mysterious white powder was, in fact, an herbal detox agent that helped remedy the effects of addiction to the drugs that the crime syndicate had been smuggling into the city - with the old man's help many citizens were able to kick the habit. This man was beloved by the whole city, had saved many lives, and Admir had just drowned him in front of traders, civilians, and children simply because some sketchy individuals told him to take care of them. They were out for blood.\n\nAdmir was fucked.\n\nI don't think our guild will be allowed back into the city\n",

        "text": "* [&lt;&lt; Previous](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/709zz5/vtm_jalees_kamal_villain_by_proxy_part_7/)\n\nAs game six rolled around, Lady ST updated me on a few things regarding Edvin’s goals, most relevant being that the ‘Anarchs’ I mentioned earlier were looking for a place to cut away from the greedy Camarilla and lay claim to as their own section of the city. The Anarchs wanted their own slice of unlife, and were keen to cut it away from one of the best areas of the city to boot.\n\nThis came to a head as one of the Primogen Council: the Brujah Primogen was dead set on allowing them to go (in fact, he wanted to join them, but that was a secret), while the Ventrue and Toreador Primogen would hear absolutely nothing about it. The Malkavian and Nosferatu Primogen couldn’t really be bothered to care one way or another, and so voted to allow them to leave, though with a curtailed amount of area to be given to them. The Gangrel Primogen - another default appointment, like Edvin - also voted to allow the Anarchs to secede. Edvin, appearing here as the Tremere Primogen, needed to keep on the Prince’s good side, but also wanted to help the Anarchs move away from the Camarilla proper.\n\nSo I abstained.\n\nBy abstaining, and forcing the point to the Prince, I was able to keep in his good graces by not voting against him, and keep from committing political suicide in the eyes of the Anarchs. I knew that the Prince wanted to block the secession, but without my vote he wouldn’t be able to secure even a tie. Technically speaking, the Prince does not get a vote on the Primogen Council, but on the same technicality, he does not need to follow the advice of the Council either. The Prince wouldn’t like it, but I was confident that even if he did realize the maneuver, I was protected enough that he would deal little, if any, retribution.\n\nThe Prince decided that he didn’t want to commit political suicide that night either, and announced that he would meet with the leaders of the local anarch movement and see if he could work with them to come to mutually agreeable and amenable terms. He then asked if everyone was willing to have Edvin come along to the talks, as the “most neutral available third party, to keep everyone honest”. Edvin projected displeasure, but of course it’s exactly what he wanted. I went along with it, and the matter was settled, and the floor passed to me.\n\nI updated the Council on my progress in researching the disease, I was making progress, but there was still too many possibilities for me to say for certain one thing or another. The Primogen were starting to feel the burden of the decreased blood flow, as their people came to them about needing to feed from clean sources. The blood banks were doing booming business, but their stock on hand was shrinking. Projections kept them operating in the clear for another two months or so, as long as they could keep the population interested in giving blood, but after that… I let the unfinished sentence hang in the air, allowing them to fill in their own worst consequences.\n\nThe Council adjourned and we went our separate ways for the evening. Edvin went into the night to search for ways to move towards his goals. He had come to this Domain specifically, and it was not lost on him that the most difficult part of his search was also the last - but that is a story for next time.\n\nEdvin returned to the coterie’s home, and found the others waiting to speak with him about their - and the city’s - plight.\n\n&gt;Edvin: “Oh, good, we have some discussions to-”  \n&gt;King: “[Dang] it, Edvin, sit down and shut up.”  \n&gt;E: “Careful.”  \n&gt;King blanches.  \n&gt;Thea: “Edvin, we have some questions. There’s been a lot of strange things since you arrived - and not to imply that you are the cause, directly or indirectly - but there has been a marked increase in the amount of weird.”  \n&gt;E: “That is not a question.”  \n&gt;Brain: “Don’t get defensive, we’ve been wondering about the timing, is all. The disappearance of the other Tremere, the swing in the political landscape of the state, the blood disease sweeping through, this new talk about an Anarch state. Things have been going… well, weird for us, but perhaps too good for you?”  \n&gt;E: “I’m still not sure that that is a question.\"  \n&gt;Miser: “What happened to the other Tremere?”  \n&gt;E: “I don’t know - not for certain. As it is an internal matter, I cannot say any more than that at this time.”  \n&gt;T: “What about the disease?”  \n&gt;E: “You know everything about it that I do, I leave the nightly reports on the table. My associates and I have managed to narrow it down to a few things, but there’s still more tests to be done. We should have concrete answers soon.”  \n&gt;K: “Why the political dust up, why the big 180?”  \n&gt;E: “It was necessary. The political landscape has been stagnant for a long time in this state, and I am tired of politicians being sleazy. Elected officials should act in accordance with their job description, and attempt to actually help their electorate.”  \n&gt;M: “Why do you seek the enlightenment of the one that hides in another?”  \n\nEdvin’s poker face is legendary. This question came from Lady ST, technically, fulfilling her role of being the Malkavian Madness Network and lending some insight to Miser. The other players looked between each other for a bit.\n\n&gt;Thea: “Does anyone know what that means?”  \n&gt;Edvin: “I know what it means. I seek enlightenment because perfection is a process, not a state of being.”  \n\nWith that out of the way, Edvin informed them of the impending talks with the Anarchs, and the apparently willingness of the current Primogen Council to apportion them an amount of land. Edvin tried to act disinterested, but the others knew him a bit too well.\n\n&gt;King: “Great, something else that you’re going to meddle in. Are there any pies in this city that you don’t have a hand in?”  \n&gt;Edvin: “Very few, but that’s not my purpose here. I keep an eye on things, and try to help them reach fruition. Change is not always good, but it is inevitable. Anyone who says that they can keep something the same is foolhardy.”  \n&gt;K: “That’s some great quote-a-day wisdom, Edvin.”  \n&gt;Brain: “Do you think it’s best to encourage the new Anarchs? Won’t that lead to more Masquerade breaches?”  \n&gt;E: “I can’t really give an informed opinion until I’ve met the Anarchs, officially. Unofficially, no, I think this is the wrong time to make this move, but I’m not the one making the call.”  \n&gt;K: “So you say…”  \n&gt;E: “In fact, it was the Brujah Primogen that fought hardest for the Anarchs, King.”  \n\nThat got his tongue pretty well.\n\nA few nights later, the Prince called upon Edvin to be arbitrator at the Anarch talks. Overall they went well, while the Brujah Primogen didn’t get too worked up and the Prince kept his legalese nitpicking to a minimum. Once the two started in on each other, it quickly devolved into ending the session for that night and continuing the next. After five nights of politics, the Anarch State was officially created in the Domain, and the Anarchs were apportioned the second best area of the city to conduct business. Edvin made a number of trips into the Barony to pay his respects and offer what advice and help he could to the new Baron.\n\nHis advice was a bit radical, overall, but it was well received by the floundering Baron.\n",

        "text": "In the dark days of high school, I started weaving together the plotlines of the games I played the most. Being that all these games  have their own expanded backstories now, there's really no other use for all the mental work I put into this than to share it with you all.\n\n**The Story**\n\nIn 1999, a cluster of asteroids entered a collision course with the Earth. The largest of these, the asteroid [Ulysses 1994XF04] broke apart in Earth's atmosphere over the western North America. The environmental effects were catastrophic.  Large fragments of the asteroid obliterated whole cities in an eyeblink, while smaller rocks pelted the planet for years afterwards. The most destructive impact was a direct hit on the Arctic ice cap, causing massive tsunamis and a permanent rise in size levels. When the chaos had subsided, the world was barely recognizable. Eurasia ended up looking [like this](http://acecombat.wikia.com/wiki/Usea?file=Usean_continent.jpg). While humanity survived as a species, most of our governments did not. Scarcity, competition, and the geographic reshaping of the world rent and folded people's loyalties and national identities. The world went through a rapid, messy process of Balkanization,  and acquiring military hardware from those who had a surplus to sell became a priority for many new nations. \n\nOther than the coastal shifts, Western and Central Eurasia were spared some degree of carnage by [Stonehenge](http://acecombat.wikia.com/wiki/Stonehenge_(Strangereal), a series of massive rail guns that fired pressure bombs over incredible distances. Stonehenge succeeded in destroying or deflecting  a great many asteroids from the Ulysses Incident, but its military potential was immediately obvious. As new nations formed across the supercontinent, a shaky alliance agreed to share custody of the rail gun array. The strongest of these new states was Erusea, formed by the remnants of the Russian military.  \n\nWhile the rest of the world rebuilt, Erusea looked to expand its high-tech military advantages. One of the more secretive programs was Project Leonidas, designed to create super soldiers. Using genetic information gained from refugees registered with international authorities after fleeing from the Impact, Erusean scientists identified a handful of people they believed they could grant superhuman strength and endurance to through a mixture of gene therapy and experimental surgeries. Erusean special ops arranged for the kidnap of two subjects. [Specimen 1](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/goldeneye/images/c/cd/Jaws.png/revision/latest?cb=20080510023317) endured the more aggressive of the procedures, grown to monstrous size through overstimulation of his pituitary gland, dosage with a Human Growth Hormone Cocktail, reinforcement of his skeleton with ceramics, and other horrors.  Scientists kept [Specimen 2](https://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/gtawiki/images/e/e4/Gta_3_screenshot.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20130406182249) more naturally human-sized, though he went through gene therapy to heighten reflexes, muscle tone, and endurance. He then underwent flash training, a procedure that uses the techniques of brainwashing to rapidly acquire a headful of skills in tactics, weaponry, and martial arts. The result of this was the destruction of Specimen 2’s personality and most of his memories. To see how he would operate in the wild, Erusean black ops deposited Specimen 2 in one of the worst places on Earth: Liberty City, built on New Jersey’s coastline by the survivors of New York, Baltimore, and D.C. Left with only a longing for revenge against those that had set him up to be abducted, Specimen 2 took work from some of the city’s gangsters, crooked politicians, and [weirdo billionaires](http://gta.wikia.com/wiki/Donald_Love), many of whom had ties to Erusea. The venture was a success for all parties. With his enhanced abilities and sociopathic disregard for human life, Specimen 2 was proved to be a one-man army, perfectly capable of blending in with a normal population. Specimen 2 got his revenge against those that set him up, yet remained obedient (and ignorant) enough that he would still follow orders. The Erusean military recalled him, reunited him with Specimen 1, and put them in command of a special ops team tasked with squashing the resistance cells that would spring up in response to the next step of Erusea’s plans: conquest of the Eurasian supercontinent.\n\nThe Erusean military launched a blitzkrieg in 2003, seizing control of the Stonehenge Array and flattening their closest neighbors. The other nations of the world quickly organized an alliance called ISAF – the Independent State Allied Forces. While ISAF had some support from the remnants of the US military and enjoyed a tremendous numerical advantage, the Erusean’s seizure of Stonehenge made the tenants of late 20th-century military superiority – air support, cruise missiles, and satellite imagery – inaccessible to ISAF. The result was comparable to a professional boxer being tossed into the ring only seconds after having his right hand cut off: with most of their tactics suddenly obsolete, ISAF ground forces suffered heavy losses from the tough Erusean army and unopposed air strikes from the excellent Erusean air force. Of particular note were the aces of [Yellow Squadron]( http://acecombat.wikia.com/wiki/Yellow_Squadron). ISAF soon decided to cut their losses and retreat to the fortress North Point, on what had once been one of Japan’s northern islands.\n\nDuring the Erusean advance, one young soldier distinguished himself. In an early counterattack codenamed [Operation Flashpoint](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaIAdHNQocA), a young corporal survived the death of his entire squad and fought his way out from behind enemy lines. He was quickly recruited into ISAF’s “Goldeneye” special forces team, and carried out a number of missions aimed at curtailing the Erusean’s ability to wipe out North Point in a single strike. Missions included [destroying a chemical weapons facility hidden inside a dam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUOqzy1PRtk) and [destroying a satellite that could deliver a targeted EMP burst]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJhJubSDuRc). Spared from instant annihilation, ISAF prepared a counterattack.\n\nISAF’s invasion of Eurasia was spearheaded by a team of elite pilots, able to take the fight to the Eruseans by flying beneath Stonehenge’s effective altitude. The most famous of these was [Mobius 1]( http://acecombat.wikia.com/wiki/Mobius_1). Mobius and his wingmen led the attack that destroyed Erusea’s [“Invincible” naval fleet](http://acecombat.wikia.com/wiki/Invincible_Fleet), then provided cover to ISAF forces as they [landed on the mainland](http://acecombat.wikia.com/wiki/Operation_Bunker_Shot_(AC04) and pushed to the edge of Stonehenge’s firing envelope. Fighting was particularly fierce, both in the [air](http://acecombat.wikia.com/wiki/Tango_Line) and on the [ground](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4wEJNjQm-8) in the jungles of the Erusean-held Istas Mountains, where the Goldeneye operators once again distinguished themselves. The ground fighting around Istas was saw the first meeting between the unnamed Goldeneye soldier and Specimen 2, who commanded the ground forces there from [a command bunker buried in the mountains]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jd1diAuVMZo). Both combatants survived their meeting, but it set up a rivalry that lasted until the end of the war. \n\nEventually, Mobius 1 led a mission to destroy Stonehenge itself, paving the way for the invasion of the Erusean homeland. The Goldeneye team inserted into the city of San Salvacion to [clear a path for ISAF tanks]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5-mmJTU9z4), while the Mobius team [engaged Yellow Squadron over their home base](http://acecombat.wikia.com/wiki/Emancipation).  From San Salvacion, ISAF broke through the Whiskey Corridor in the [biggest battle of the war](http://acecombat.wikia.com/wiki/Operation_Sandstorm). The fall of the Erusean capital of Farbanti followed soon after, and Mobius 1 and Yellow Squadron had their [final battle](http://acecombat.wikia.com/wiki/Siege_of_Farbanti) over the half-flooded city. \n\nThat should have been the end of the war, but it wasn’t. Specimens 1 and 2 led a force of Erusean fanatics to the top-secret Megalith missile launch facility, off the southwest coast of Erusea. This needlessly large, complex facility housed the targeting and launch systems for a series of interceptor missiles. When properly targeted, these missiles could redirect remaining Ulysses asteroid fragments in Earth’s orbit down to the surface. The Goldeneye team led the [assault into the facility]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nLd4DRZWn0), where the lead agent killed the hulking Specimen 1 in a blistering firefight. He then proceeded to the targeting facility at the top of the Megalith, [where he killed Specimen 2]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2n9M_XQr5U) by shooting him off the top control tower. Mobius 1 performed his usual heroics, flying inside the Megalith to destroy the large ICBMS hidden there. The Continental War was finally over.\n\nThings get weirder for our super-soldiers from here. The Goldeneye agent lived out his life in relative peace. A century or so after the war, however, he was cloned by the [Carrington Institute]( http://perfectdark.wikia.com/wiki/Carrington_Institute) and paired with their top agent, Joanna Dark. Together they fought their way through humanity’s first conflict – albeit a covert one –  with alien races. Earth found itself caught in the crossfire of a war between the Skedar and the Maians, each of whom where fleeing from the yet another alien threat: an alliance of powerful species who called themselves The Covenant.\n\nThe truth of the Maian/Skedar incident was highly classified, known only to a handful of world leaders and military attaches. Still, the threat posed by alien invasion was enough to drive the nations of Earth together, and they eventually formed a unified government.  Humanity pushed out into the stars as one, though of course tensions between core worlds and colonies eventually appeared. All the while, the various deep science divisions of mankind looked for ways to make better, stronger soldiers that could one day confront the still-secret alien threat. Researchers at the Office of Naval Intelligence eventually discovered the records of Erusea’s old Project Leonidas, along with a more macabre find: the cryogenically frozen corpses of Specimens 1 and 2. In a series of surgeries and experiments horrid even by their low standards, ONI kitbashed the two Erusean super soldiers together, adding in modernized upgrades and cybernetic components. In the end, they created the flagship soldier of the Spartan-II supersoldier program, a nameless warrior known only as the Master Chief. \n",

When I eventually killed something with the shard, however, it grew into an enormous longsword covered in chains and spikes, and asked my character - in a voice uncomfortably similar to the other voice that haunts her every move - \"**Are you to be my new wielder, girl?**\".\n\nThe weapon made a *fantastic* gift for the party's raven queen worshipper.",

Edvin, surprising the others, was against telling anyone of the issue. He wanted to conduct additional tests before starting a panic amongst the Kindred of the city.\n\nAnd so science was done.\n\nEdvin tested a variety of different scenarios, including tracking down the last few people that Thea had fed on to test them for various issues, bleeding Thea completely dry and refilling her, having Thea burn blood until completely dry and refilling her, and even running her blood through his semi-mystical dialysis machine. Nothing worked to clear her system. Edvin packaged as many unique bits of tissue that seemed to display the disease as he could, and set it off to various labs across the country on rush order, but after a week none of the tests could find anything mundane that was different about the tissue.\n\nEdvin tried to call on Jalees for aid, but his response was pointed: “Not my pig, not my farm”. Meaning, the disease wasn’t because of him, and it wasn’t his job to clean it up.\n\nWhen the fifth game rolled around, I had finally cleared XP expenditures and ritual learning times with Lady ST, as above. We sat down and started to ponder about what our next step was, when I was told that Edvin had a message to his personal email: “Agents removed from power.” It was a coded message from his allies that he had working on the removal of his “pursuers” from Tale #5. He shared this with the group, and filed it away to present to the Primogen council on their next meeting.\n\nHe also brought up that the group immediately needs to bring up the disease to the other Kindred of the city. Among other things, others should be warned to be careful when feeding, and that any with symptoms should come forward immediately to help the effort to cure it or alleviate the effects. Thea was solidly behind it, but Miser and King were leery - concerned that their initial decision to hide the disease for a week would be viewed unfavorably at court.\n\n&gt;Edvin: “We were investigating the disease. It’s entirely reasonable that we wanted to know the facts before causing a widespread panic.”  \n&gt;Miser: “I doubt the Prince will see it that way.”  \n&gt;Edvin: “The Prince is irrelevant. He may dislike it, but he cannot change the past, and acting against us will not change the future.”  \n&gt;King: “Make sure he doesn’t hear you say that.”  \n&gt;Edvin: “In this instance, I’d say it to his face. This affects all Kindred of the Domain, not solely him.”  \n\nEdvin declared that he’d bring it up to the Prince at once, who would likely call a Primogen council, which would give him a larger platform to work with. Edvin was already in good with most of the other Elders, especially considered at his advanced age of around 800 years, put him older than the rest of the Primogen council combined. Many of the Elders were surprised that Edvin had no childer, given his great age. Edvin told them that he had had childer over the years, but most had either betrayed him or had been wiped out by those that pursued him.\n\nAnd so Edvin sent a message to the Prince concerning the new blood disease, and was shortly sent a reply that the Primogen council was to gather immediately. Edvin bid his fellows goodbye for the moment, and set off to handle business. With a couple of extremely difficult social rolls barely succeeding, Edvin was successful in convincing the others that there was a blood disease in the Domain, and that action needed to be taken immediately.\n\nThe Primogen debated long into the night, and into the wee hours just before sunrise, and decided that they needed outside help. Edvin was convinced that this was not a run-of-the-mill disease, but instead something custom developed - whether by science or magic, he did not know. Edvin offered to send out samples to a couple of particularly trustworthy Tremere and Nosferatu that he knew, and was interested in sending one out to a particularly insightful Malkavian. The Lunatic was denied, but the others were approved, and Edvin did so as the first tinges of light came.\n\nThe others had a hard debate about kicking Edvin out of the coterie. They were convinced, by King, that he knew more than he was letting on, and that Edvin himself may be the source of the disease. That last part had some very suspect logic on it, but King was able to browbeat them enough to make it seem reasonable. When Edvin didn’t return until the sun had almost risen, and found that everyone else was asleep already, he checked his tapes - one of which included the full discussion that the group had. He was wounded that they would think that he could have done something so heinous.\n\nWhich is exactly what he told them the next night.\n\nNow that Edvin was there to represent himself, the conversation went in a completely different fashion. Edvin was able to calmly poke holes in every theory presented until Swiss cheese had greater overall density. Each point was refuted step by step, and none of the nonsense that King spouted stuck. Edvin even had charts and diagrams. Yes, Edvin overprepares. It’s at least half of the reason that he’s survived so long.\n\nAnd so Edvin appealed to the others’ reason, and successfully held his position in the Coterie. Thea and Miser were particularly happy to have kept him, given that he’d already been of great use to them. Edvin declared that he was going to be spending most of the night researching the blood borne disease that had cropped up, and would make time to take meetings with others if the need arose. He bid the others good night, and retired to his lab to work.\n\nThe others allowed him to work unmolested, each having their own problems to deal with. King was struggling to keep up with all of the requests for his presence at parties, now that he’d proven to people that he could be a nice and polite dinner party guest. He’d been wining and dining through the socialite circles in town for a few months now, and was beginning to detest attending. He strategically planned which invites to accept and which to decline. He needed to keep the circles intrigued with him to keep his influence up, and it did not come easy to him.\n\nBrain and Miser were hard at work optimizing the running of the blood banks without negatively affecting the day to day operations and the employee and client satisfaction. Efficiency is important to keeping costs low, but the key to keeping revenue high is the ability to keep a steady, revolving stock for immediate sale. To do that for a blood bank, you need to keep an influx of bodies moving through the process, and have enough storage to keep a large supply on hand for any sudden spike in consumption. It helps immensely when your target audience consumes your product.\n\nThea had the worst night of any, though. The hallucinations were the worst, even though she stayed locked in her room for a majority of the night. All of her fear, distrust and anger came boiling to the surface whenever she looked in the mirror, or thought about herself, or thought about being a vampire - really, whenever she attempted to do anything. Initially she was successful in staving off the madness, but eventually her will began to falter, and she descended into ranting and raving at the empty air.\n\nEdvin’s work, even after pulling on his manifold strings, was ultimately inconclusive, though he did manage to narrow down the possibilities. After sending out the new information to the Primogen Council, he settled down to pass the day. Edvin had successfully ruled out normal Tremere thaumaturgy, almost all of Assamite Sorcery, Necromancy, and most parts of “Setite Sorcery”. He farmed out a couple of the less well known parts to trusted colleagues, and awaited further data from them. What most concerned him was what he hadn’t managed to ruled out.\n\nInfernal Thaumaturgy.\n",

        "text": "I've been running a campaign as a DM for a few months now. At the end of each session, I do a write up of everything that happened, so that anyone who missed a session could catch up on events.  As time as gone on, these have become more elaborate, with lot's of invented dialogue that only loosely occurred, but still remains true to the actions of my chaotic players.  I make no apology for lifting NPC character names from modern pop culture references.  Also, in later episodes the language and themes turn a bit salty (that's foul language you know).  If these get enough positive response, then I will keep posting them, because I think that they are genuinely good and funny.  All comments and criticism warmly accepted. \n\nWithout further ado:\n\nTemple Of Set Episode I – And so it begins..\n\nOur party came together in the capital city of Jerum to take part in the invocation ceremonies of the Temple of Ra opening the great hunt for the long lost Ruling Rod of Ra. The party spent interminable hours in the heat listening to the long windy speeches of the clerics of Ra as they invoked the blessings of the god on their quests and wished all the participants great success in their journeys. For if the evil designs of Set were ever to be countered, it was imperative that the long lost temples of Ra and Set be located and the Ruling Rod recovered, despite the fact that in over five millennia of searching, no one had been able to locate these structures which were lost at the end of the first war of the gods.\n\nAs the day wore on and night fell, the invocation ceremonies took on a more festive atmosphere and eventually concluded with a giant light show put on by the clerics of the temple. The party retired to a nearby pub and drank to celebrate their future success. Many toasts were made and many rounds were ordered. At some point in the watches of the night, the party decided that they had had enough and decided to leave the pub; in fact right after they were thrown out by the bouncers.\n\nAs they stumbled down the streets of Jerum looking for a nice warm rubbish pile to collapse in, the party managed to notice that they were being followed by a number of large shadowy figures. In fact, these figures turned out to be mercenary fighters from the thieves guild. The guild had got word that some unlicensed larceny had taken place and had sent their heavies out to deal with the perpetrators. Whether or not the party where the actual perpetrators or not is inconsequential. The fighters had been out searching all night and this lot of drunken rabble would do as well as any other.\n\nA short scuffle ensued and the drunk party didn’t stand a chance against the trained and highly motivated warriors, who mercilessly pummelled the party into submission. The members were dragged back to the thieves guild headquarters basement where they awoke many hours later with sore heads from the drinking and the beating.\n\nThe party noticed several things at this point. First, that they were suspended by shackles from the ceiling and stripped to the waist. Second, that two ugly half orcs were guarding them, and that a large number of cruel looking instruments of torture seemed to be placed around the room, including a rack, wheel, iron maiden, and a virtual Justin Bieber who would presumably sing his greatest hits non stop until the will of the victim shattered.\n\nThe party tried to get some answers about where they where and how they got there from the guards, but the guards had no time for them and merely told them in no uncertain terms to shut up and wait for the boss who would explain it all. Failure to shut up would lead to them taking steps and activating the Bieber. The party immediately shut their gobs.\n\n\nAfter some time had passed, the door to the basement opened and a halfling dressed in an ostentatious gold robe and dripping in jewellery escorted by two cowled priests entered the room. The halfling seemed to perpetually be carrying a mug of steaming hot coffee in his hand. He also had the curious habit of wearing both an expensive looking belt along with gaudy red braces to hold up his trousers. The halfling explained that his name was Bill Lumbergh, and the he was the senior division vice president of the Jerum chapter of the thieves guild, and that his associates were Bob Slydell and Bob Porter who were consultant clerics on hand to help him sort out some personnel issues at the guild.\n\nLumbergh explained that normally the party would just have been put on trial by the guild for their crime of unlicensed larceny (All crime is regulated by the guild. Freelancers are not tolerated as they are bad for business), however in this instance he was “Afraid I’m going to have to ask you guys to do me a little … um … favour. Oookay??) It seems that a member of staff had, about six months prior, done a runner with the guilds idol to their patron saint the goddess Rennett. The guild needed to stay in the good graces of their deity in order to preserve their house advantage in the casinos that they run in the city, and that with the theft of the idol the goddess was extremely put out with the guild and they were now just relying on blind luck to ensure profitability. The central executive board of the guild had been kept in the dark about the extent of the Jerum guilds problems, however with the AGM shortly approaching and the annual P&amp;L numbers needing to be published it was imperative that the guild reacquire the idol and be able to put a positive spin on the budget report for 1989. The guilds non-executive board members with such colourful names and Sammy “The Skull Crusher” Graviano, and Saul “Big Pussy” Weinstein were not well known for their patience and understanding when guild division senior vice presidents reported growth rates of less than 5%.\n\nThe guild master told the party that he had tried hiring mercenaries to track down the thief, however the goddess was adamant that only guild members participate in the recovery operation. Two groups of members had been sent out. The first group had tracked the thief, who went by the name of Milton, to a cave in the Iron Hills (about two weeks travel outside of Jerum), but that was the last anyone had ever heard of them. A second group was dispatched, and although they had returned, it was with neither Milton or the idol. The members of the second group were crazy, and spoke of a land of beast men, and barbarians who inhabited ancient ruins in a secret valley in the caves and that everyone would be well advised to stay away from that place and avoid the “yellow death”.\n\nThe guilds permanent staff was getting a bit stretched at this point, and hiring more people was out of the question as the HR budget was not going to stretch to accommodate the new demand on resources. So Lumbergh made the party and offer. They could either become temporary unpaid members of the guild and go recover the idol for him, or they could be tied up with lead weights attached to their ankles and take part in the world record holding your breath underwater in the harbour competition. The party decided to become members of the guild.\n\n“So if you guys could go and get my idol that would be great.. Ok?” The Bob’s then produced a detailed contract that the party members were required to sign in blood outlining their rights and responsibilities as provisional members. The main points of the contact where that the party was obligated to the best of their ability to recover the idol of Rennett. The recovery of Milton was left to the discretion of the party. Dead or Alive. Failure to pursue to the quest would result in the party members dropping dead, their souls the becoming the property of Lumbergh, presumably to be tortured for all eternity in the heart of the Bieber. As a nod to the fact that the party members were not being monetarily compensated for their work, the guild would waive the usual 30% vig on all recovered treasure, the party could keep 100% of the profit with the exception of the idol of course. In addition the guild would provide free transportation to the Iron Hills, cover all reasonable living expenses, and outfit the party with whatever equipment they needed to get the job done, completely pro-bono. Should any of the party members die in the course of carrying out their duties, all funeral expenses would be covered by the guild.\n\nLumbergh then wished them they best of luck, and reminded them to file their TPS reports when they returned. Just to be helpful he would make sure that the party received another copy of the memo regarding the new cover sheets that must be used when filing the TPS reports.\n\nThe following morning, the party set out with their escort of thieves guild fighters for the Iron Hills. The two week journey passed uneventfully and the party eventually found themselves at the mouth of a weed choked cave deep in the Iron Hills. (The last town, High Rock,  was about four days travel back down the road.)\n\nThe escort told the party that they would make camp here and hold the fort but that they would not be venturing into the cave. An investigation of the cave ensured. The Barbarian, Gundrak, discovered some sacks of spoiled food rations just inside the mouth of the cave, and the Rogue, Shinra, was able to determine that the remains of campfires that they had found where at least six months old and fit the time frame for when Milton would have passed through the area.\n\nAs the party explored the cave, they also located some tracks that seemed to indicate that Gnolls, Cows, Dogs, and Iguanas had passed in and out of the cave several times. Human tracks were also discovered, as well as a single mouldy boot that looked quite similar to the ones that guild members commonly wore. Presumably this boot belonged to Milton who if he is ever located will be barefoot. After about half an hour of travelling through the cave, the party heard a roaring sound. They located the source of the roaring which was a large chamber with a hole in the ceiling about 100 feet above their heads. Through the edge of the hole, a waterfall was pouring down from the ceiling and into a pit which opened up before the party.\n\nShinra spent about ten minutes exploring the ledge of the chamber and discovered a locked wooden chest. For inexplicable reasons, the dwarven cleric, Ared, decided that he was best placed to open the chest and proceeded to bash the lock in with his war hammer. His intention was, however, greater than his skill, and all he accomplished was breaking a hole in the chest, leaving the lock perfectly intact. Undaunted by this setback, he then proceeded to spend the next ten minutes breaking the hole open wider until he was able to get to the treasure inside.\n\nThat treasure turned out to be a well constructed rope ladder, and various other climbing implements, spikes, hammers, and extra rope, necessary for descending into the pit. The wizard, Krystina, was unimpressed with all that and clearly did not trust the rope ladder. She had perhaps been scarred in a previous life where such mundane things as rope ladders contained the most devilish of traps (and you would have to roll an athletics check every 10 feet which is complete bullshit of course. But that was another game with a not very good DM ). In this case the wizard preferred to trust to her own skills and cast a spell of feather falling to allow herself, the barbarian, and the wizard, to descend gently down into the darkness. Ared was having none of this arcane nonsense, and since he had put so much effort into getting the damned ladder in the first place, descended entirely without incident (or a single roll for that matter).\n\nAt the bottom of the pit the party noticed that the water became a river which lead out into a jungle. Despite the cool alpine climate that they left at the mouth of the cave, this environment seemed steamy, hot and humid as if it were located at a much lower latitude or in some deep recess of the world's past. The party noticed what appeared to be the ruins described by the second thieves guild expedition some distance away in the valley centre, as well as thin tendrils of smoke rising into the air at the far end of the valley.\n\nSome time was spent (about an hour) following Gundrak as he attempted to lead the party towards the ruins, however under the canopy of the jungle, their direction could not be determined (and as no one had thought to bring a compass), the barbarian led them in the wrong direction. Shinra then climbed up a tree to get their bearings, and the party precoded much more slowly towards the ruins.\n\nTwo hours later the party broke out of the jungle and came across the ancient ruins. Before them stood a large building with no obvious entrance and what appeared to be trees growing out of the building itself. The stone was well dressed and may have looked impressive a couple of thousand years ago, but time had not been kind; erosion and weather had worn down the building.\n\nShinra did a preliminary search around the building and discovered the foundations of another building; it’s wall long since fallen away and appropriated for other purposed by someone or something, as well as an extensive reed filled swamp. A five foot wide shaft that appeared to be very very deep was found at one corner of the main structure and the party also located a small building which was missing a roof and whose floor was choked with dead leaves and weeds, but did have a set of stairs descending into the darkness.\n\nThe party decided to explore the stairs, and proceeded to light some on their torches as the descended into the dark depths of the buildings cellar. Upon reaching the bottom, the party discovered that the corridor they were in, indeed it really wasn’t a basement at all, turned 90° to their left and led to a deep chasm spanned by a rope bridge with a T intersection fashioned into it.\n\nThe ever cautious thief inspected the rope bridge and found that it looked both sturdy and recently constructed compared to the rest of the site, possibly only 50 years old as opposed to thousands. The party set out over the bridge crossing the chasm, continuing along the corridor and came eventually to a set of black iron doors and another T intersection. Nobody thought to listen at the doors, and the party casually opened them to see what was inside.\n\nInside the room was lit with torches set in sconces on the walls of the circular chamber, which was also draped along the walls. In the centre of the room was a five foot pile of human skulls (interior design by Pol-Pot), atop which was set a basin of “holy” water. Hidden inside the room where a number of plate-male armoured warriors and two clerics who had been alerted to the parties presence by their use of torches when they came down the back passage. A battle ensued, and one of the clerics, who turned out to be a necromancer, raised a zombie to fight as well. Despite the overwhelming odds, the party fought well, with the mage using her shocking grasp to electrocute the plate-male warriors, while the barbarian and the cleric relied on brute strength to get the job done. The sneaky rouge dropped back into the darkness and proceeded to pepper the opposition with arrows, at one point pinning a warrior to the rear wall. That foe was later raised as a zombie, who also met an untimely end at the hands of our heroes.\n\nHaving dispatched their foes, the party decided to search the room. The barbarian pulled back the curtain at the rear of the room and revealed a three metre tall black statue of a god with the head of a jackal. The barbarian got a palpable sense of fear (not something that usually penetrates his thick skull) and called the cleric over. The cleric immediately knew that this was an idol consecrated to the dark dog Set, but in that same instance he was paralysed with fright for the next 60 minutes and could not be coaxed out of that state despite the attempts by his friends to do so. He was joined in his paralytic state by the wizard who felt that she should also suffer in sympathy with the burly dwarf.\n\nHaving recovered from their fright, the party continued their exploration of the ruins and discovered a shrine to Set complete with a sacrificial altar (which was also moist with fresh blood) set right against  a deep chasm, from which presumably victims could be tossed into once there hearts had been cut out and burned in the small braziers which were currently cold and banked. Through an amazing stroke of luck, there was no religious ceremony taking place when the party stumbled into this, as who know what powers the high priests of the death cult possess and what they would do to any who dare to interrupt the most holy of dark rites.\n\nContinuing on past the altar room, Shinra continued to prove her value to the party as she discovered a trap door cunningly disguised as part of the floor. The party resourcefully recruited the bodies of the dead warriors from earlier as a test for the trap, and proceeded to dump them into the depths below thus determining that the door swung down and away over a ten foot square area and reset itself as soon as it had dropped it’s load, presumably by means of springs. All the party members easily jumped over the trap, except the dwarven cleric, who presumably due to his stumpy legs, managed to land in the middle of the trap. However due to extraordinary luck he managed to land just past the fulcrum point and the trap didn’t dump him into the watery depths below.\n\nAfter passing this obstacle, the party came to yet another T intersection, and as it always sensible in maze, continued their habit of turning left. This led to another set of black iron doors, only these were slightly ajar. The thief peered inside but couldn’t see anyone inside or make out much beyond another set of doors inside the room. The party retreated back to the intersection (which was a very defensible position) and stopped to decide what to do.\n\nWhile our heroes where dithering, the guardsmen who had been waiting in ambush in the treasure vault lost their patience and decided to bring the fight to the invaders. A short nasty fight ensued. One of the guardsmen who thought that they were being overwhelmed by the invaders legged it back to the treasure vault and released the guards pet brown bear while two other guards ran off in the opposite direction, and have not been seen again since. The remaining warriors and the bear put up a strong fight. The dwarven cleric was brought to the brink of death at least three times and had to be revived by his companions, using up a large supply of the healing potions that the guild had supplied, but in the end, the tactics of ranged sniping by the thief, raging by the barbarian, and proper application of electrical current by the wizard eventually one the day.\n\nHaving defeated their foes, including the bear, our party decided to investigate the room that they had found. On the walls were set torches in sconces which appeared to be burning and providing light, but never using up any fuel. Set into the floor on opposite walls where two large stone chests, and the opposite side of the room contained an open set of black iron doors, from whence came the bear presumably. They carefully checked the chests for traps, and finding none decided to open the chest. This, of course, immediately caused the curse set on the chests to invoke dropping the strength of our dwarven cleric to that of a weak frail old man (no save!), and released a cloud of sleeping gas into the room. Other than that, the only contents of the chest were disappointment. The wizard attempted to open the other chest, which also released a curse and dropped her strength to a minimal level. This chest however contained much treasure, including a jeweled mace, several gems, some gold, and a platinum chest containing a set of glass eyeballs that detected as magical.\n\nAfter about an hour and a half, the wizard and the cleric discovered that their strength had returned. Having defeated some foes and discovered some loot, the party decided to rest in the room. The rear door to the bear cave was trapped with a cunning alarm by the wizard, and the party settled in for a well deserved rest.\n\n\nWill the party remember that they only alarmed one of the doors? Will the guards who ran off during the last fight manage to raise the alarm and summon help to stop the looters? Will the only person in the party (Ared) with a +2 chainmail shirt manage to survive a battle without dropping to 0 HP? Find out in the next thrilling episode. \n",

        "text": "Having a Battletech background that entirely consists of “played the one game from that universe everyone liked less than all the others,” “played Mechwarrior Online before I knew what I was in for” and “saw Let’s Plays of Mechwarrior games people actually admit to enjoying” makes me assume weird things. At some point my concept of how Battlemech warfare worked was the Mechassault model: dumbly stomping around in a solitary Battlemech and putting bullets in every building to search for shiny boxes colored like my Xbox buttons before being put in a deeply impractical assault mech with not quite enough armor and definitely not enough speed to avoid having half the Inner Sphere’s mech arsenals thrown at it in an inelegant blob on the way to go blow up a giant spark plug. Then came Mechwarrior Online, where my experience back in the closed alpha (or was it the closed beta?) amounted to “accidentally crash into other mechs to ragdoll them,” “assume Ultra Autocannons are automatics because of that one Dragon with a three-barreled Gatling gun arm-looking thing since Rotary Autocannons aren’t a thing yet and never get corrected until I try it myself in a much later build” and “watch helplessly as my framerate falls like a Death From Above attack on its way to miss its target.”\n\nSo, okay, I was aware that mechs could fall over and that there was more to it than having the biggest dudes and that there was falling over involved somewhere. But clearly a simplified version of the Battletech experience had not prepared me for the real thing, where I quickly learned that I still had a lot of learning to do. It’s like...going from NBA Jam to playing an actual game of basketball with all the rules and everything. All of a sudden there’s little nuggets of information that start catching you out because they involve details you’ve never even considered before as they’d never been there to present a problem, and since they’re all coming at you all at once in a conga line all of a sudden you know friggin’ nothing. Here’s the stories I have of what I learned when I got blindsided by rules I never asked my friend about and instead learned firsthand like a complete idiot:\n\n**Pavement Is Dangerous.** There was no campaign with my friend, I was just learning how to Battletech from oneshot skirmishes so we could play with cool kit. One case was a Solaris arena battle, and already I can see the veteran BTechers bracing themselves to wince when I get to the punchline, because it was full of paved areas, bridges and buildings. Again, prior to my forging as a BTech player with real experience, I had come from video games where it was assumed mechs were flat out awesome, like having zero issues running around on pavement. So I use my usual tactic of “fast heavies and flanking,” go up to my full run speed and hang a turn expecting to do a good opener to start hostilities.\n\nSurprise! When turning in a mech on pavement at full tilt, you have to make a piloting roll, showing their skill to...well, just watch. If your pilot passes this roll they can turn and keep moving. If they fail, they fall over, damage the mech from the landing, might be knocked unconscious from the impact, and then slide along the ground. Thank God all that didn’t happen, just...the falling over bit, damaging bit, and skidding bit. I believe I had to switch to Plan B at this point and stop my speedy advance, and I either lost that battle or fought to one of numerous draws with my friend to where we just kind of had nothing that was able to fight and weren’t in a position to eventually score a decisive victory. No more turning at full tilt on pavement, then, since we just used stock pilots and didn’t mess with the stats.\n\n**Everything Is Destructible...** My misadventures in the concrete jungle didn’t stop there. See, not too long after that I was in another urban map and decided I’d go to other things I liked to get mobility in built-up areas, like jump jets. I quickly fell in love with jump jets because you could travel at a reasonable clip if you had the right setup, you would be trickier to hit that turn, and essentially just rotate and fly however the heck you liked. They were one of the few things that worked exactly the way they kind of did in my only frames of reference…\n\nPsych! No, they weren’t. I thought I’d get a leg up by getting some high ground on some buildings. Hey, in Mechassault you can hover up to a rooftop to snipe at dudes, and in Mechwarrior games you can probably go jetting around on top of buildings; sure goes that way in MWO, indispensable for lights and mediums. Turns out, in Battletech proper, Inner Sphere residential(?) architecture doesn’t much appreciate getting a 50+ ton walking tank landing feet-first on it, which means my mech’s feet went right through the building, followed by the rest of it, falling down, falling over, and ending up on its back faster than Filbert in a Rocko’s Modern Life bit. Lesson learned, don’t perch on everything like an excited cockatoo.\n\n**...But Some Things Are More Destructible Than Others.** Then there was another Solaris throwdown, one where I was confronted by something I’d never seen before, or that I didn’t know I was even confronted with: a bridge. In Megamek, bridges look next to no different than normal roads save for an elevation marker, which means it can be kind of easy to lose sight of what it is you’re looking at...even when it should be really, really obvious, which is probably why this was less me being fooled and more me learning another painful lesson about how to Battletech.\n\nUnlike those fragile standalone buildings, bridges don’t much mind mechs stomping all over them, but they do mind when you shoot them. I didn’t know that because I mistook the bridge between two buildings one could actually drive a mech through for a ground-level road, which I actually thought would be to my advantage to destroy. I had no wheeled or tracked vehicles to take advantage of the roads, and mechs could fall over if they turned on this one patch of pavement, so blasting the roads and cratering them the way you would a runway sounded like a great idea, you know what I mean?\n\nPerhaps I should have thought of that before opening fire on the bridge I was bloody standing on.\n\nI fell right the hell off the ex-bridge, and, stop me if you’ve heard this one before, fell over and took damage. So...yeah, don’t do the dumbest thing you could possibly do. Real important lesson, huh? If only that wasn’t one of my own mechs on that bridge, that would’ve really turned things around!\n\n**Rock ‘N’ Roll Ain’t Noise Pollution.** Here’s a positive one, a sort of happy rookie mistake. I loves me my Rotary Autocannons and Heavy Assault Gauss. They’re essentially flavors of Gatling gun: an Autocannon will fire one shot a turn, and an Ultra Autocannon will fire up to two shots a turn if you want it to, with the risk of it jamming and requiring a roll to clear the jam. A Rotary will go up to six if you want, letting you put up to 12 damage on a target in one burst for an RAC/2 or a serious 30 for an RAC/5. They don’t get any bigger, Mechwarrior 4 made up the RAC/10 and RAC/20 for the video game and they only (hehe, “only”) get Ultras which will still puke 20 and 40 points of damage respectively from a single gun. The way I look at it, if there’s a risk of jamming, why not deal with the risk and shoot it out?\n\nBoy, oh boy, would that get me far. I love my Rotaries and Ultras and they love me back, so don’t fear the jam, people. It’ll happen, and you don’t use a Rotary or an Ultra Autocannon to make safe shots. You make them to fill the air with shells, so make them loud and make them count. They will drill through armor, needle internal components and cause ammo racks to cook off. They’ll break legs and force mechs to the ground. In conjunction with other weapons, and maybe by themselves in the case of the RAC/5, they’ll do what my friend saw me pull off and knock a mech over in a single volley by passing that magic 20-or-so damage mark, the target blows a piloting roll and falls over.\n\nSo, what’s a Heavy Assault Gauss? It’s a magnetic Gatling gun. Gauss Rifles put out their damage in one blob of like 15 or so damage points, Heavy Assault Gauss does it in 20, 30 or 40 one-point projectiles at a time depending on the design used. Same deal, though, waddle in close and start sandblasting targets clean off their feet. And man, can a HAG/40 do that if you get lucky. Get hot and don’t be afraid, especially since these babies don’t jam. If you ever get the chance to use these don’t pass it up. They’ll treat you right if you trust in them. Just don’t fear the fun switch. Throw it and hang on.\n\nIsn't learning fun?",

        "text": "The crew and most of the party were below deck, questioning and probing, asking whys and wherefores of the stowaway goblin. What he had seen of this so-called river monster. Aro had had enough. Enough of the confines of the ship. Enough of the cramped interior. Enough of the circles the talk was walking.\n\nHe climbed from the hold to the deck, from the deck toward the crew cots. The night was shining cold and a breeze stirred. Stirred and scraped. A chill walked down Aro’s spine and he saw. Saw without seeing. Saw without looking. Felt, with every muscle, the electrifying pulse of danger behind him.\n\nTurning he saw it. He saw it against the dark. In the light of the stars and the moon and the lanterns he saw it. Blindly reaching, scenting, knowing him, where he was, without seeing. A great lurid pad, a thing of glistening hooks and suckers blindly reaching toward him without seeing, but knowing where he was, knowing him. \n\nA scream built in his mind. A tense scream that locked his muscles and consumed his mind. He tried to draw his sword. He tried to draw his sword and tripped. It struck. The hooks bit into him. Held him. Pinned him. Dragged him. The thing dragged him to the gunwales. Battered him against the gunwales. He dropped his sword in fumbling terror.  It lifted him up. The pain searing into him. Burning him. Tearing him.\n\nPounding feet like drums and his fire golem, chain mail infused with a fire spirit, burst into flame as it charged. Burst into flame and burst the ship into flame around it as it charged. It struck with its sword of fire. Struck and the blow glanced off the slick hardness of the chiten of the thing. The sword glanced off and Aro was lifted higher. A second thing reached from the water. Loomed from the water and slammed into the golem. Slammed into the golem and dragged it too. A spasm ringing down it as it grasped the fire spirit. Grasped the fire spirit and did not let go. Dragged it into the water and purged it. Quenched it. A plume of steam hissing burst like white flame and engulfed the ship deck as the golem was quenched.\n\n“DEATH” was the cry. “DEATH” rang the word. A word filled with fury. Filled with a berserk fury and violence rolled off it like a wave. A great hammer swung. Swung as the Ogre that wielded it charged. A brutal ugly charge of total violence. The hammer blow was the cry, “DEATH!” A violent ugly total death. The hammer landed, crunched, broke, severed, pulverised the thing. A mash of flesh and gore spattered the deck. Spattered Aro as he fell to the deck. Spattered the Ogre as his berserk charge carried him off the ship. Off the ship and over the thing. Over the water. A second blow he swung. The great hammer spinning in his hands struck. Struck hard. Struck with all the violence and force of the cry, “DEATH!” More flesh, more gore. The wet and bloody writhing thing from the water split, the force of the blow a shockwave echoing the cry, “DEATH!”\n\nWith a great splash the ogre hit the water. Fighting against the weight of the hammer he carried. Fighting to keep his head above the water. Fighting to live. A rope was cast from the deck and the ogre grasped it, was dragged by it. Dragged back to the burning ship spinning slightly in the current. Dragged up the side, over the rail, onto the deck.\n\n“The monster comes!” came a cry. Lord Heron leaned over the rail placing a bolt in the rail of his crossbow and crying again, “The Monster comes!” Firing into the rolling water, firing into the dark mass. Firing into the fell shape surfacing. \n\nQuoil the Changeling, dropping the rope he had used to drag the ogre, ran to the mast. Ran to the mast and climbed. Reaching the nest he pulled his bow and strung it. Bent the silken wood and strung the bow, nocked an arrow.\n\nBelow, on the deck, the ogre Yew Orca, and the mail clad goblin Tink, leapt from the gunwales. Leapt from the gunwales hammer and sword raised. Yew Orca’s clothes a wet weight, hair plastered across his face, river water still stinging his eyes. Goblin and Ogre leapt. Leapt onto the evil mass rolling from the water below them. Lord Crane fired another bolt. From the nest an arrow sang true. Aro, his wits gathered, cast brimstone to the star pricked sky above him, and with the Sunstone clenched in his fist, called down a terrible fire…\n\n***\n\n\nWell - that's an overly dramatic version. The funny thing was that the creature was dead with the first hit. The ogre charged and struck and killed it in one hit. Moments later Lord Crane (in the game elderly, and 'today' was a bad day - sore hip, pain in back etc) saw the river monster surfacing and started a call to arms - shooting as he did so.\n\nHad he passed his Vigilance test he would have noticed the thing surfacing was a dead body floating to the top.\n\nThe rest of the party kept attacking - hammering, sword blows, arrows, fireballs. It was hilarious. They didn't stop until one of them passed a vigilance test and realised the thing was dead already. Counting up the damage they had killed it five times over. None of them paused to ask why it wasn't attacking back - they just kept whaling on it. \n",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/6zpbz7/dd_the_tale_of_the_flaming_cheese/",
        "text": "So in my world we have the group named the Flaming Cheese... we have Shifts-The-Oak, a werewolf fighter, we have Chatter, a four-armed squirrel-taur fighter, we have Luperion, a giant lizard man barbarian with an acidic spit once per day, we have Zyreth, an anthropomorphic iguana cleric majoring in necromancy given his backstory, we have Leon, an anthropomorphic lion bard, and Smoke, an anthropomorphic raven ranger. This is 3.5 with about 80%+ homebrew, which accounts for the anthropomorphic races.\n\nIn my world I have things called Perils. They're worth 2000+ EXP if completed, with a LOT of sweet loot. They range in severity from 1 (\"Extremely Dangerous but doable\") to 6 (*\"This is an excuse for the DM to kill you.\"*) -- I had the party roll the severity of the Peril, and more 6s were rolled than anything else. The party decides to go \"fuck it, let's go!\" -- they'd cleared a Peril (a 4 on the scale) earlier in the session and feeling lucky, they wanted more EXP and loot.\n\nIn my world I also have a \"Critical Rule\" -- you can't be killed if you've got above 20% HP. If you take a life-ending hit, you're dropped to 1 HP if you're above the Critical Threshold. This protects low-HP characters at low levels and gives them an additional chance to escape. Perils ignore the Critical Rule; that's why they're called Perils.\n\nThe party has entered the cavern tomb of the man known as Veldarian LeCourse... an anthropomorphic rat who made some bad deals with the \"Tyrannical Darkness\" (the great satan of the anthropomorphic peoples) and lost his life. In the center of the tomb there is a magic circle with a treasure chest; off to the right are three more chests open and displaying all manner of coins, gems and wealth. Guarding them are two \"spirit demons\" in the shape of dogs. The dogs can assume the form of a PC to nullify damage from that PC, and on top of that are only damaged by magic weapons.\n\nStanding on the opposite side of the magic circle are three animated suits of armor, mounted on what appear to be clockwork \"war bulls\" (which Shifts identifies as being \"clockwork minotaurs\" instead, just on all fours). They don't act or move, and behind them at the far corner of the wall is a large \"tornado\" of blackness with Veldarian's soul firmly imprisoned in a crystal orb. Zyreth recognizes the whirlwind/tornado as being a direct conduit to the Tyrannical Darkness... although a weakened version since there's no amber anywhere in the tomb (amber being the signature mineral of the Tyrannical Darkness).\n\nOnce he sees the open chests, Luperion, being dumb as bricks (Int 7), immediately engages the spirit demons with his *Glaive +1 of Shocking Burst.* This wakes up the whirlwind and the Tyrannical Darkness uses His divine power to spawn three more animated suits of armor (which I called Silent Knights), calling for the party to entertain Him. The battle begins.\n\nLeon by accident enters the magic circle -- it's a gravity trap pulling anyone who enters closer to the chest. The chest itself is whispering \"Greed... greed...\" He almost gets devoured by the chest but at the very very last second luckily escapes the circle after a long set of failed Fortitude saves (3.5 with lots of homebrew). Unfortunately he winds up on the opposite side of the enemies and ends up getting focused down. He (and his pet tiger Tigger, who was a major tank in this fight) end up being first on the casualty list.\n\nSmoke immediately takes off and flies above the cavern, peppering the Silent Knights with arrows. These are things with 88 HP each, so he's not dropping them fast despite two attacks per round. He escapes the carnage with falling damage only (as late in the fight the Tyrannical Darkness threw a *Hold Person* on him and he was paralyzed mid-air).\n\nThe battle remains very close throughout the combat, Zyreth breaking out a wand of healing for his allies and the party consuming their potions during their turn in order to stay in positive HP. It was so close the Tyrannical Darkness was on the edge of Its seat and I described Him as being so -- if the party had survived, He would have *rewarded them handsomely* for sure.\n\nAfter Tigger begins constantly and reliably critting on every hit, the Tyrannical Darkness makes His move, \"spicing things up\" in order to remain entertained. He throws screaming souls around the Spirit Demons, causing them to both replicate as the demons split in half, and give the Spirit Demons an AOE effect for some damage to anyone who approaches them. Zyreth goes \"Nope nope nope\" and reaches out, using some of his special Necromancy powers (which he gets by having ranks in Profession: Necromancer) to draw the souls into his claw as a ball of raw soul energy. The first Spirit Demon loses its AOE effect.\n\nZyreth then reaches over to the second Spirit Demon and does the same thing, but fails the Will save to hold on to the raw energy. It explodes, triggering the energy sphere already in his hand as a chain reaction *Fireball* effect and almost blowing half the party up. The Silent Knights and Clockwork Minotaurs got the worst of it. The Tyrannical Darkness is amused and doesn't spawn any more enemies or tricks until Luperion decides to start chewing through the knights, using his Acidic Spit (once a day) to deal major (7d7) damage.\n\n\"That's not very sporting!\" cries the Tyrannical Darkness. \"Spitting on someone! How rude!\" *Hold Person*\n\nLuperion is paralyzed after a failed Will save (he needed to roll a natural 20 to save as his Will was too low, which is why he was targeted) with three or four Silent Knights coming in on him to coup-de-gras and finish him off. Shifts-The-Oak stands over the body of his fallen friend and holds them off for two or three rounds but in the end he gives his life and it isn't enough. Chatter takes up arms over Luperion, but can't penetrate the Silent Knight AC and he too, falls trying to save Luperion. Then Luperion is killed.\n\nI feel bad for Shifts-The-Oak -- he didn't roll higher than a six on a d20 all game. He'd been having this problem for several sessions, and he'd lost his previous werewolf Roman because of it.\n\nZyreth decides it's time to break out his special power known as \"Fracture The Soul\" (Ranged Touch, 3d7 damage, slight chance of raising the corpse as undead if killed). The Silent Knights are made out of soul-stuff, and take double damage from the effect. Zyreth facepalms and lays utter waste to the Silent Knights in the next few turns. He'd been debating all throughout the fight whether animated suits of armor would be affected by his powers. \"Souls are MY DOMAIN, BITCH!\"\n\nWith the battle over, only Zyreth and Smoke survived. Now Zyreth is about to make deals with the Tyrannical Darkness to perhaps raise his fallen allies to life so that the party isn't mostly eliminated. This isn't a sure thing and may very well be the end of the Flaming Cheese.\n\nWord to the wise: If the DM makes an encounter \"an excuse to kill you\" and labels it as such in plain sight going \"dude, you attempt this, you're going to Get Fucked.\", you don't take it, regardless of the reward. Still, the Flaming Cheese knew what they were going in against when they rolled, they understood the risks and discussed them since they were inches from their current goal elsewhere on the map, and everyone (save for Leon, who was new to the group, felt like he'd been dragged along to something he didn't want, and left the table because of it) had a lot of fun.",

        "text": "The party, drawn by the sounds of combat, burst into the clearing to discover a quite amazing sight: several skeletons had surrounded a huge half-orc, who was nearly naked save for a loincloth and a hide tunic. This, of course, was hardly exceptional at all for these adventurers. What made it surprising was the weapon wielded by the half-orc: it appeared to be a small tree.\n\nIndeed, it was. After \"rescuing\" the brute from his undead assailants, the party learned a little about him. Very little, in fact: Not only was Klob'Hur (as they learned was his name) quite illiterate, he also was almost completely lacking in any social ability - or, indeed, ability for higher thought! However, he was quite happy to share the tobacco in his pipe. Which, as it turned out, was also the tree-weapon he wielded with such ferocity.\n\nSlowly, painstakingly, the party learned bits and pieces of the origins of their newfound dimwitted friend. Klob'Hur seemed to remember very little, besides the forest. It would seem that he had been abandoned there by his parents at a very young age, left to die. But die he did not, and for thirteen years he had learned the ways of the wild and how to channel his inner rage when necessary for survival. Then, one day, for reasons that Klob'Hur was never able to communicate (or, perhaps, understand?), he left the forests.\n\nBut he got homesick quickly. So, he went back for something to remind him of his wooded home. When he left again, he brought with him his favorite... tree.\n\nKlob'Hur did not stay with the party long. While he proved an invaluable aid in battle (and as a restraint against the party's overzealous halfling sorcerer), his easily-distractable nature led him to wander off one day in pursuit of a \"budder flah\" that crossed the party's path. Though the group went on to many epic deeds, they never encountered Klob'Hur again... though occasionally, in quiet moments, some of them thought they saw a huge shape happily bouncing about in the distance, or heard the distant \"hu hu hu\" sound of the blissful laughter of a large man...\n\n----\n\nSo, Klob'Hur was a D&amp;D 3.5e character I played last Autumn who I absolutely fell in love with. It was a simple build idea I had toyed with for a bit: a barbarian built around the Monkey Grip feat. Our DM had us roll our stats, rather than point-buy. The result was Klob'Hur: a half orc with 20 strength and 16 con, middling dex and wis, and *abysmal* int and cha scores of 5 and 4, respectively.\n\nHe was a lot of fun to play, and the backstory I had written for him was pretty fun too. I even \"wrote\" journal entries for him, usually consisting of torn, slobbery, or blood-spattered pages with occasional doodles in whatever substance was readily available during the previous session. Unfortunately, due to pressures of school (and another group) I was forced to leave the campaign after only two short sessions.",

        "text": "The story of the hero's death is an oft sung tale. The legendary warrior who sacrificed herself to save her friends, or the mystical sorceror who lost his life saving the world. Death is seen as glorious, a fitting end, the ultimate sacrifice. But what of the others? What of the soldier killed in a meaningless war, or the child slain in a bandit raid, before their life could even truly begin? Death is not glorious. Death is the cold, ancient finger that touches us all. Older than time, older than the gods, and the only true certainty.\n\nReultian Nightlotus did not lead a happy life. Born into a family of drow necromancers deep in the oppressive Underdark, he was forced to face the pain and darkness we call life long before he should. Reultian's parents, usually apathetic in their approach to life, were inspired through their child's birth. They brought the drow together in pursuit of a greater future. Reultian was only a child during the escape, but he and his family, as well as many others, successfully escaped and made their way to the surface. With a world of opportunity ahead of them, they chose to venture to the Elven capitol and start over. Upon arrival, they were met with persecution and pain. Elves do not take kindly to those they find unworthy, and drow are often seen as the lowest of the low, hardly fit for even slaves. Reultian found himself an orphan before he could spell his name. Stumbling into adulthood, he slowly raised himself into a man. Dark magic flowed through his blood, and he learned the art of Necromancy. With this newfound power, he decided that a life of slums and darkness did not fit one such as he. His dark influence was felt throughout the city, and stories of a powerful drow wizard spread through the streets, empowering his kin just as his parents had before. As Reultian rose through the ranks, he met another remnant of his clan, who had survived with her wits and determination. They instantly fell in love, and were quickly married. For once in his miserable life, Reultian was happy.\n\nAll things are cursed to end. For some, it is far sooner than others. One horrible night, Reultian's wife was murdered and he was mortally wounded. As he lay in the darkness, staring at the corpse of his happiness and wishing for vengeance, he was approached. The Matron of Ravens, the goddess of the bridge between life and death, had been inspired. She restored his life and granted him a pendant in the shape of a raven, holding the image of his wife. His soul may no longer be his own, but a second chance was all he wanted. The next morning Reultian left the life he had spent his life building in the darkness and began his quest of vengeance.\n\nMany years later, Reultian had allied himself with a small group of adventurers, the closest thing to a friend he had since. His search had led to only dead ends but he was never discouraged. His party consisted of a few adventurers, each with their own goals. Drake, the human gunslinger, believed in making the world a better place as a hero. Nelson, the human warlock, was only a child of 13 and remained naive yet brave as he searched for his mentor. Ramen, the half elf cleric of Sarenrae, had been cast out from his church and sought to redeem himself. Drake knew Reultian the best, though he rarely spoke of his life before. They only knew of his search.\n\nA local baron hired the party to find an ancient dwarven forge, long forgotten by most and supposedly the home of many powerful weapons. They discovered the entrance far in the mountains, and found it had been occupied by orcs. Fighting their way in, they cleared the makeshift base the orcs had constructed and killed their leader, ending the series of orc raids plaguing the area. Below the base was a long series of steps, and a cave home to many horrible beasts. As they ventured deeper, battling through troglodytes and stirges, rescuing and befriending a trapped bear, Ramen was injured and knocked unconscious. The party unearthed a tunnel leading to the surface, and left Ramen outside with the bear to rest. Back into the caves, the party became more vigilant as their healer was unavailable. Passing through tombs of ancient dwarves, they uncovered old yet pristine weapons marked with the smith's symbol, and realized they were drawing closer to their goal. Reultian took one of the swords as it radiated magical energy. An enormous cavern filled with glowing fungi and glittering crystals stood ahead, and a large door marked with the symbol stood at the end. The party waded through the waist-high mushrooms until they had nearly reached the door. Suddenly, two gricks, horrible, tentacled worms, dropped from the ceiling in front and behind them, snarling through their sharp beaks. A battle ensued, and one of the beasts was injured and fled into the fungi. Moments later, it erupted from behind and grasped Reultian with its tentacles and began to squeeze. Before Drake or Nelson could react, the grick scored a critical hit and crused his spine, before burying its beak into his chest and dropping him limply to the ground. Enraged, Drake took the sword from Reultian's body and decapitated the worm in a single strike, before unloading his revolver into the other. They were dead.\n\nReultian Nightlotus lay dying in a cave he didn't even know the name of, surrounded by people he could barely call his friends. Drake knelt over him, pulling him into his arms. Nelson solemnly stared into the Earth as he reflected on his choices.  Reultian gazed at the ceiling as his body grew numb. Weakly, he reached into his pouch and held his pendant above him, opening it to see his wife one last time. He opened his mouth and could barely speak.\n\n\"I... failed.....\"\n\nReultian's eyes closed and he fell limp. The pendant slipped from his hand and fell onto the bloodied ground. Drake shouted into the cave, his words echoing against he glittering walls. He promised that his life wasn't in vain, that he would find the murderers and enact vengeance himself. He held the bloody pendant aloft as he made his promise. The spirit of the raven left Reultian and entered Drake, sending a chill into the air. With this, Reultian was gone. \n\nDrake and Nelson lifted up his body, and stepped through the doors. As they closed behind them, the sound of a distant hammer on anvil rang out.\n\nReultian's fate did not fit him. He should have survived, and continued forward, growing stronger and eventually avenging his wife. He would have become a legendary figure, influencing kingdoms and planets, and one day dying one of those glorious deaths bards like to sing about so much. Instead, he died in a dirty cave, killed by an insignificant monster on a quest that would have been forgotten in a month. All are equal in death. Fate isn't real. The world isn't fair. Sometimes, you just have to accept it.\n\nAnd that's the story of the first pc I ever killed.",
