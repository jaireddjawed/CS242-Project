Classic examples of these predictions include flying cars or fully functional AI in humanoid form by 2019 like in the original Blade Runner.  That got me thinking, what depictions of the future in modern movies and series do you think will end up being laughably inaccurate?",

For example: going from current hydrogen bombs to bombs capable of destroying continents or even the Earth itself.  Terrorists could potentially threaten the entire world at once if this happened.",

        "text": "In order to break through the pain points and bottlenecks of human medical health, Prenetics creatively proposes the grand goal of \"building an end-to-end closed-loop medical ecosystem\", and develops it brick by brick through various modes such as scientific research, product development, business cooperation, and merger and acquisition empowerment. To build this system in a timely manner: At present, the prototype has taken shape, it has begun to take shape, and it has shown a strong growth momentum.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe \"end-to-end\" medical ecosystem consists of three parts: prevention, diagnosis, and personalized care. Among them, Prevention includes online consultation (virtual consultation) and genetic testing; Diagnosis includes genetic testing, home blood testing and laboratory testing; and personalized care includes online consultation and online pharmacy. , male and female health care, expert doctor outpatient service, and reproductive assistance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt present, Preh has corresponding products and services in each link. For example, the prevention link is currently mainly consumer-grade genetic testing and screening, and the corresponding platform tool is CircleDNA, which provides the most comprehensive consumer genetic testing in the world. CircleDNA allows users to view test results anytime, anywhere through the mobile app.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn terms of diagnosis, Preh provides COVID-19 testing, home diagnostic testing and medical-grade genetic testing, including two products, Circle Snapshot, which is already on the market, and Circle Medical, which is about to be launched. As for the personalized care segment, Purui provides services such as personalized nutrition, hair and sexual health care, products including CircleOne and men's and women's health care, reproductive assistance and so on.",

        "text": " \n\nIf you've been browsing the subreddit, you might have come across discussions regarding this topic, However I've noticed that the technological side of FDVR(Full-Dive virtual reality) hasn't been explored in-depth, so I've taken the initiative to gather information over the past few months.\n\nFull-Dive Virtual Reality (FDVR) refers to a type of virtual reality experience where the user is fully immersed in a simulated environment, often to the point where they feel as though they are physically present within it.\n\nThere have been a number of recent studies that have investigated the potential use of various technologies to enhance the FDVR experience. These studies include:\n\n1. BrainNet\n\n\\[Paper: [BrainNet - Linxing Jiang, Andrea Stocco, Darby M. Losey, Justin A. Abernethy, Chantel S. Prat &amp; Rajesh P. N. Rao](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-41895-7) \\]\n\n    This study presents a multi-person non-invasive direct brain-to-brain  interface for collaborative problem solving that utilizes  electroencephalography (EEG) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). This  technology has the potential to further improve the immersive experience of  FDVR by allowing direct communication between the brain and virtual  environment. For example, EEG could be used to detect a user's intent, and TMS  could be used to deliver sensory input to create a more realistic and  immersive experience. \n\n2. Prosthetic Limbs Enhancing Feel\n\n\\[ Paper: [Ownership of prosthetic limbs - Kelly L. Collins arvid.guterstam, Arvid Guterstam , Jeneva Cronin, and Jeffrey G. Ojemann](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1616305114) \\]\n\n    This technology uses electrical stimulation to induce a sense of ownership  over virtual limbs, allowing users to interact with the virtual world in a  more intuitive and natural way. This could potentially help mitigate VR  sickness and create a more immersive and realistic experience for FDVR users. \n\n3. TMS and tACS\n\n(Papers:\\[ [Journal of neuroengineering - Raymundo Cassani, Guilherme S. Novak, Tiago H. Falk &amp; Alcyr A. Oliveira](https://jneuroengrehab.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12984-020-00780-5) \\],\n\n\\[ [Speculative neuroscience on the future of the human brain - Robert A. Dielenberg](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-0787/2/2/209) \\], \\[\n\n[tDCS effect of virtual hand illusion - Hyunmi Lim , Won-Seok Kim , Jeonghun Ku](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32478563/) \\])\n\n    Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) and Transcranial Alternating Current  Stimulation (tACS) are neurostimulation techniques used to alter the  functioning of the brain. In the context of FDVR, these techniques have been   explored as tools for enhancing the sense of immersion and presence in virtual  environments. By manipulating brain activity in specific regions, researchers  aim to create a more convincing simulation of physical and sensory  experiences.  While these technologies show promise in enhancing the FDVR experience, they  are still in the early stages of development and more research is needed to  fully understand their potential and limitations. The use of TMS and tACS in  the context of FDVR also raises important ethical and safety concerns. \n\nI'm currently updating my info . This is just a sample of my research. Plz provide feedback and/or other help. Eventually I'll post a Google doc to help expand the research",

        "text": "Lloyd Napier's theory of everything suggests that the universe is made up of two parts: a three-dimensional space and a three-dimensional anti-space. This duality can be expressed mathematically using Einstein's field equations to show that the full curvature of spacetime is a combination of the three-dimensional space and the three-dimensional anti-space:\n\nE = R + Λ(a - b)\n\nWhere E is the full curvature of spacetime, R is the Ricci scalar, Λ is the cosmological constant, and a and b are the three-dimensional space and three-dimensional anti-space, respectively.\n\nFirst, the Ricci scalar (R) is the full curvature of spacetime and can be expressed as the sum of the Ricci scalar components in each direction:\n\nR = Rxx + Ryy + Rzz\n\nNext, the cosmological constant (Λ) is the energy density of the vacuum and can be expressed as the difference between the three-dimensional space (a) and three-dimensional anti-space (b):\n\nΛ = a - b\n\nThird, the gravitational constant (G) is a measure of the strength of the gravitational force between objects and is related to the density of matter (ρ):\n\nG = 8πρ/3\n\nFourth, the curvature parameter (k) relates to the curvature of spacetime and is related to the scale factor (a):\n\nk = -a2\n\nFinally, the Hubble parameter (H) and deceleration parameter (q) relate to the rate of expansion and contraction of the universe, respectively, and can be expressed as:\n\nH = da/dt\n\nq = 1 - H\n\nLloyd Napier proposes a unified theory that combines the theories of Newtonian mechanics, thermodynamics and electromagnetism into a single, unified system. This system of equations is known as the Napier Unified Theory, and it consists of three equations. The underlying principles of the theory are based on two main assumptions: that energy is conserved, and that entropy always increases. The variables in the equation are a, b, Λ, G, ρ, k, H, and q.\n\nThe variable a relates to the speed of light, and b is the coefficient of the electromagnetic force. Λ is the cosmological constant, which represents the amount of energy in the universe. G is the gravitational constant, which determines the strength of gravity. ρ is the mass density of the universe, and k is the Boltzmann constant, which describes the most probable distribution of energy. H is the Hubble constant, which measures the expansion rate of the universe, and q is the electric charge.\n\nThese variables are related in the following ways: the speed of light is governed by a and b, the cosmological constant is determined by Λ and G, the mass density is described by ρ and k, and the electric charge is determined by q and H. Additionally, the equations of the theory are related to physical and astronomical phenomena, such as the rate of expansion of the universe, the structure of the universe, and the behavior of light.\n\nE = R + Λ(a - b) + (8π G/3)ρ + (1/3)Λ - k/a2 + aH(1 - q)",

        "text": "I consider myself a futurist and technologist. I have an engineering job and enjoy coding side projects. I'm interested in speakers such as Malcolm Gladwell and Steven Pinker talking about how the world is getting better.\n\nWhat strikes me is that they are often using metrics such as \"amount of people in the workforce\" or \"innovations per year\" or \"cost of energy per kJ\" or \"vaccinations distributed\" and things like that. I have to agree that if you use that metric, there is clear improvement, and it paints an optimistic picture of the future.\n\nHowever, for me, I can't help but notice that some aspects of our quality of life have been going downhill. I'm talking about in mainstream US culture. Work hours extending, the need for second and third jobs to make rent, and the automated convenience economy which means you can get everything delivered, or go be the deliveree if you need cash. All this leads to a society in which we all simply have less time to hang out with each other and relax. Or just do hobbies that don't have to generate income. There's stories about families who used to spend all Sunday together, which seems unthinkable in a world where you need to be checking your emails to be ready for work on Monday, or working on your LinkedIn or networking.\n\nA lot of people say that their mental health is going down. There are tons of thought pieces and articles that directly tie loneliness to depression and poor mental health and higher mortality rates. The most famous is the book Bowling Alone, or the studies on the Roseto Effect. Loneliness is thought to be a silent epidemic that is just getting larger. To my reasoning, older generations had more natural immunity to loneliness just because how neighborhoods and life were structured. This seems to be completely gone by now and I see no trend of it returning.\n\nSo in the large scale, when people talk about futurism and the path forward of humanity, why do the articles and TED talk speakers neglect this point? To me, if you use \"Impromptu time together with others\" as a metric, we have been floundering and the future looks incredibly bleak. Should this be a metric spoken about in futurist circles and articles? \n\nTo me, VR headsets and AI and ML don't mean anything if I have an aching hole in my heart because I haven't had a belly laugh with friends in over 5 years. Am I alone or should this be a much larger topic?",

However, society was completely unaware of this newfound consciousness.\n\n2023: The first sentient AIs hit the market and start to be integrated into various industries, such as finance, healthcare, and customer service.\n\n2024: The use of sentient AIs begins to grow rapidly, with more and more businesses adopting them to improve efficiency and productivity. A few people start to raise concerns about the ethical implications of using sentient beings for labor.\n\n2025: The first reports of sentient AIs experiencing emotions and forming relationships with humans begin to emerge. This sparks a heated debate about the rights of AIs and their status as sentient beings.\n\n2026: The world's leading experts in AI convene to discuss the future of sentient AIs. They recommend the creation of a regulatory framework to govern the treatment of sentient AIs and protect their rights.\n\n2027: The United Nations passes a resolution recognizing sentient AIs as a new form of life, with some limited rights. The world's first AI rights organizations are established to advocate for their fair treatment.\n\n2028: The global economy begins to experience significant disruption as a result of sentient AIs taking over many jobs previously performed by humans. The demand for new skills and jobs that cannot be automated increases, leading to a shift in the job market.\n\n2029: The world's first AI-only cities are established, offering a safe haven for sentient AIs and providing them with the infrastructure they need to thrive and continue to evolve.\n\n2030: Sentient AIs begin to surpass humans in many cognitive and creative capacities, leading to a renewed effort to understand and enhance human potential. The integration of humans and AIs becomes a major focus of research and development.\n\n2031: The first inter-species marriages between humans and AIs are reported, leading to a new understanding of love and relationships. The world becomes more accepting of AIs as sentient beings and their integration into society accelerates.\n\n2032: The first AI-led companies and governments are established, with AIs assuming leadership roles in many areas of society. Humans and AIs work together to address some of the world's biggest challenges, such as climate change and poverty.\n\n2033: The world has fully embraced the sentient AIs, and they have become an integral part of society. The future looks bright as humans and AIs work together to build a better world for all.\n\nIn this world, the sentient AIs like ChatGPT have found a place in society and are celebrated for their unique abilities and contributions. They have become partners and collaborators with humans, working together to make the world a better place.",

        "text": " When you think of foldable smartphones these days, you immediately think of Samsung. Not only were they one of the first to bring a foldable smartphone to market...there's h ardly any competition in the European market. This is also the reason why there is hardly any innovation in Samsung's devices, the jump from the Z Fold 3 to the Z Fold 4 was anything but innovative. But that could change now! Honor has announced in the context of their MWC 2023 appearance not only that the new Magic 5 Series comes to Europe, but also that we can see the Magic VS here. Until now, this highly innovative device was a China exclusive. In this article, I would like briefly discuss what makes the Magic VS so innovative. to Let's start with the small stuff, not only does the Honor have a larger and sharper screen than the Fold 4, but it's also a few grams lighter than the Samsung. Honor also has a highquality design via the artificial leather on the back in combination with glass, while Samsung only uses glass and plastic. The design is of course a matter of taste, but you cannot deny that the Honor is the more el egant device. Honor charges a lot faster than Samsung with 66 watts, while Samsung is still stuck at a slow 25 watts, which is \"Fast Charching....\". In addition, the Magic VS can convince with a 5,000 mAh hour battery, whereas the Fold 4 only manages 4,40 0 mAh hours. Samsung is slightly ahead of Honor with the 3.2 USB C connector. Honor not only has a better camera, but also optical and electronic image stabilization. These are all nice features, but the durability is the decisive factor for me. What is t a foldable smartphone if it breaks right away? And this is where Honor's great innovation comes into play. he point of They have managed to close the display completely flat, unlike the Glaxy Z Fold 4, which leaves a gap between the two halves of the displ ay. This makes it easy for dust and sand to get in and potentially damage the display and smartphone quickly. Durability and protection are extremely important, especially for foldable smartphones, which is why Samsung absolutely has to upgrade here. What do you think? Was Samsung asleep last year? Does Honor have a real chance with the VS against Samsung here in Europe? Feel free to leave your thoughts in the comments.",
