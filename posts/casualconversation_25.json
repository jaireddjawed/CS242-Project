Not like ADHD but I just have a lot of energy during the day. Which is ironic because I'm the one who is known as reserved or stone faced. I just want to do a lot of things. Like whenever I'm out with friends, I just wanna explore and  go places,  whereas 9/10 times my friends are gonna want to chill at someone's house or relax somewhere or whatever which ends up killing me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd I like things that are just completely different from them.

Things like cars and auto body repair, billiards, motorcycles, firearms, mountain biking, more extreme sports, etc. Idk sometimes I feel like leaving it because of how completely different I am from the rest. I mean I appreciate them. I just don't feel like I'm a good fit. Noting is wrong with them it's a me issue. I guess me being a very independent person doesn't help much either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIdk what kinda experiences do you guys have with stuff like this?",

I saw that fucker rub it's front legs in glee and prepare to gorge itself. I stayed as still as I could to bait it in and slowly got my hands in position to crush it into the next dimension. \n\nYou can probably see where this is going. In my haste to send this mosquito back to hell, I didn't position my hand quite right, which resulted in the blow glancing off my knee and right into my groin. I had a split second to think through all that was good in my life before the pain came crashing through. All I could do was curl up in a ball and try not to cry from the pain and laugh at the absurdity of the situation since that just made the pain even worse. \n\nI fucking hate mosquitoes so much, man.",

I couldn't buy anything, I just liked looking. When I got there I basically ran to the manga section, pretty much no one was there which was definitely expected the store isn't even really that popular since my town is 80% old people. I just looked around scanning the titles talking to myself then I got overly excited at the sight of the \"Soul eater\" selection. I said \"Soul eater!!\" And ran over basically vibrating with excitement, I knew I couldn't buy it but oh my god did it make me smile! Then I heard someone say \"You like soul eater too?\" I swear my heart basically died, I'm bad at conversation and any interaction ever but I didn't want to seem like a complete freak. \n\nI spun around and nodded, then I actually got a good look at who spoke to me - tell ya what, he was beautiful, drop dead gorgeous, I didn't even know people in my town could be so pretty. He smiled and asked me who I liked the most, of course, I said \"Crona\" because they are the best and I won't budge on that! He hummed and said Crona was cool but he liked Death better, which..fair he is pretty awesome. We talk a bit about the story and what we liked and didn't liked, I don't know what led to it but I mentioned it was my birthday and he smiled so nice and said \"Happy birthday!! Want a hug?\" Granted, probably should of been less excited to hug a complete stranger (at least he was close to my age maybe  17) and I said yes and he gave me such a nice hug. \n\nI got to see one of my favorite franchises manga in person, met a beautiful guy who was sweet and had a common interest, AND I got a freaking hug?? Plus it was all on my birthday?? How awesome was that?? Also he smelt so good, do guys normally smell that good??? \n\nAnyway, it was like I was love struck, I was so sad to see him go! But I'll forever remember that kindness, I haven't experienced much kindness like that and I rarely ever get hugs - what a great day that was :D\n\n(I know this is probably some amount of cringe but it's genuinely so heartwarming to think about!)",

I am also introverted and I am working in a supermarket now but there is this co worker girl who is introverted too. For starters I didn't pay attention to her( no offense to her I didn't pay attention to anyone at the start ) but someone told me she is similar to me and then I saw her and had this feeling.....dunno how to say She was extremely cute and all my thoughts were that I wanted to meet her and learn more about her. I talked to her once and she seemed to be interested in talking to me since people say she never initiates a conversation with others but she did with me after that. \n\nI have this feeling where she is in my mind and I feel disappointed if I don't see her but I want to learn more about her and I want to take it very slowly because if she is like me she would want the things to be slow too. \n\nI just don't know if it's normal to be thinking so much about a girl I barely know to the point even my pulse is different when I think of her.",

        "text": "Google's dominance has been challenged recently by some about its ability to find relevant search results. \n\nI agree there has been deterioration in the results  due to the massive number of SEO related keywords being used by marketers, \"sponsored \" results, and random websites that appear to imitate keywords or information relating to your search but lead to dangerous sites exposing users to potential cybersecurity attacks. \n\nPersonally I find myself to be very good at boiling down search terms to bring back relevant information. Along with self-filtering the useless results I mentioned above. On top of that from time to time if I really want to get down the rabbit hole, I'll use the translation tool to search in other languages and then translate the results back to English. That alone impresses me so much. \n\nFinally, my opinion is Google still has great utility in finding relevant information.",

I’ve made the right choice and everything, the only thing is now I’m having trouble really getting motivated to play at all. There is a maximum of 5 and minimum of 3 games left of the season and of my career (I can explain why it’s not a certain number in the comments if anyone is interested) so it’s not much for me to overcome but still I was wondering if anyone else had experienced anything similar or had any strategies they use to motivate themselves in situations they don’t want to be in.

I feel it sometimes too when I see little kids at the grocery store with their parents and I remember doing that as as a child. There are other instances too, but these are the main times I get that feeling. It is not a bad feeling. It is sort of aching but in a good way. Just a sudden, painful awareness that there are other people in the world and they have lives that are different from mine and I will never know them all. They have internal thoughts like me and a million mundane things happen to them everyday, just like me, and just like me they will never mention it to anyone because why does it matter? But at the same time I feel so happy to know that there are other people in the world who have lives and thoughts and problems and I am not alone So it is a very wistful, bittersweet sort of feeling.  Has anyone else experienced this? Is there a name for it?",

I just thought the gameplay was a bit silly but fun\n\n\nMy big go-to sites back then were mostly ArmorGames, FOG, Kongregate, Newgrounds.., and there were also others I visited occasionally for specific games like Miniclip and even Y8 (though some of the other options on that last one were a bit... weird). It's just cool how easy and accessible this whole variety of games was.\n\n\nOur fam wasn't really into buying video games or consoles so it was either hop on to one of these sites for free or we would use our allowance to buy our own games off Steam, etc., so these were one of my main sources of entertainment when I was younger and a big part of my childhood.. some of them do have remakes like the MNOG I mentioned but most of them are gone forever now",

I made more than I would have at my previous job managing a restaurant with an addict as a GM. It also just gave me something to do for the day. An opportunity to be around people, when I typically seclude myself when I'm in a bad place with my depression and anxiety.

There was this one boy, (won't say his name for privacy) I had a teensy crush on him at the time and on one day It was almost time for everyone to get on the bus' to go home and I was putting my backpack on In the hallway when he looked at me and says, \"You have the eyes of \\[either a lion or tiger?\\]\" or something along the lines of that. keep in mind this was around the age where a girl hates every part of herself. I can confirm I smiled all day long afterwards. It's now become a habit that I compliment atleast one person a day on something, ex: \"you're smile is beautiful\" or \"you're outfit looks very nice\" small things, but \\[boy\\] will never know how much I still think about that moment to this day.

Well we text back and forth to one another nothing serious just getting more acquainted. Well it has been a couple of weeks since we’ve seen each other and I had made plans with my cousin and our kids to go bowling and the old mate is also friends with my cousin he’s actually the reason we had seen each other after Al these years. So my guy wanted to know if I wanted to do something with him I told him yeah great but I gotta ask my cousin and he ask me why I said I didn’t know that u wanted to hang out so last week when we didn’t hang out I made plans with my cousin to go bowling and I wanna check to confirm or not but if we r going bowling u wanna go with us. He said yeah sure and he was like will we get time alone I said with a grin maybe and gave him a wink. He said we got a couple of days to find out I will. So he never texted me the next day which ain’t un common but we do text  yesterday but he never mentioned it so I finally b4 it got too late texted him tonight and asked hey was we still going to hang out and he texts oh I didn’t know u wanted to hangout 2 night I made plans with hanging out with my dad 🤨🫢🤔🤔I think he should have well what I would have done in that moment would be like hey made plans with dad let me call him and make sure that he and I can do something together 2 mar. But nope nothing he said sorry and he’ll text me later. Am I wrong for feeling like that I mean he sees his dad pretty much anytime every day. But it just seems to me I’m not that important and he’s seeing someone else which is fine bc we r not exclusive so I feel rejected.  Oh he also said he’ll make it up to me and that he’s sorry well I would be a very rich woman for every time I heard I’ll make it up to you bc I’m my time no man has ever made anything up to me.  So there ya go I guess I will move on.  But I would like opinions and advice and please b nice.",

Punched in the door code then dropped off the groceries at their door and left. All good right? Wrong. \n\nI got back to the gate and some asshole mf decided it was a good idea to put ANOTHER key pad on the inside so you have to put in the code again.  Well, this wouldn’t have been a problem except the code was different. I know this because I remembered the entry code and tried it when I finally got out and it worked but the outside keypad was out of reach so I couldn’t use it.  \n\nAlso, since I closed the delivery I couldn’t contact the customer and for the life of me I couldn’t remember the door code to go back inside and ask. I tried a dozen times but no luck. Also, no call box. \n\nSo now I’m staring at this 7’ tall gate with absolutely no foot holds. Thank Jebuz there weren’t spikes on top. My only option is to try to hoist my out of shape ass up and over. Easier said then done.  \n\nFirst try, hilariously not happening.  Second try, a little better but also not happening.  I had to stand back for a second and realize I’m kinda screwed but I have another delivery to make with the clock ticking. \n\nThird try, I took a running start and goddamn I’m struggling but determined.  Finally I’m able to throw a leg over the top and drag my pathetic sack of loser potatoes on top. Pretty sure I pulled something in my back but whatever. I made it. \n\nNow to get down without hurting myself.  Arms shaking, back burning, I managed to slowly lower myself to the ground. \n\nI imagined someone looking out their window watching my dumbass struggling to scale this stupid gate and laughing. Maybe they filmed it and they’ll post it on Reddit so I can relive the horror. \n\nI got back to my car feeling pretty defeated. I think I need to start working out again lol!",
