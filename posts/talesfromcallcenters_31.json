        "text": "I don't know if this will make you guys want to facepalm as hard as I did, since I guess the story is a bit specific to the fact that I work in call center that handles retirement investment accounts, but I'm guessing most of you folks will get why I'm still shaking my damn head over a call I had on last night's shift.\n\nAs I mentioned, I work in a call center that services retirement accounts.  Among the many things account holders can do is transfer funds from other eligible retirement/employer plans (like 401(k)s and IRAs) into their accounts with us.\n\nIn order to do this type of transfer, 2 items are required: a form that needs to be filled out by both the account holder and the financial institution sending the funds, and a transfer check for whatever amount is being deposited.\n\nA guy calls in to check on the status of a transfer request he says he has submitted (he'll be GC for \"genius customer\" and I'll be \"me\").  At first glance, I don't see that we've had anything come in, so I ask him to hold while I look through another part of the system.  I look, see nothing other than a note saying he had called in a couple of weeks ago and another rep gave him instructions on how to complete the transfer process.  But we haven't received anything from him, neither form nor check.\n\nSo I return to the line, thank him for holding, and tell him that I'm not yet showing any indication that the request has been received, but that it can sometimes take a few business days for us to be able to see submissions once they are received. I was getting ready to suggest that he simply call back on Monday or Tuesday so we could check status for him again when he said:\n\nGC: \"That doesn't make any sense. I faxed the form **and the check** on Wednesday.  They should be there by now.\"\n\nUmmm...Wat?\n\nMe: \"I'm sorry, sir, did you say that you *faxed* the check to us?\"\n\nGC (exasperatedly):  \"Yes, yes! I faxed the form and the check together on Wednesday.  There's no reason they shouldn't be there already.\"\n\nMe: \"Well, I think I may be able to offer you an explanation about why I'm not seeing anything in the system.  You see, sir, when a transfer is requested, we must receive the physical check in our office in order to process it.\"\n\nGC: \"What do mean? I can't fax you the check?\"\n\nMe (flipping up my mic over my head and stifling my mouth with my hand so he won't hear me laughing hysterically at him because our phones have no mute button): \"Unfortunately, no, sir.  We are not able to process a faxed check image in order to effect a transfer into your account in the amount of several hundred thousand dollars. Do you still have the original check that was issued by the other plan?\"\n\nGC: \"Of course!\"\n\nMe: \"Excellent.  Allow me to suggest that, at your earliest convenience, you resubmit both the form and the original check *by postal mail* to us at the following address.  Once we receive both required items, we will be glad to process your transfer. Is there anything else I can help you with this evening?\"",

        "text": "So one of the services the power company I work for provides is area lights that look much like street lights installed on customer's properties if they have an existing power pole in their yard. Customer pays a flat month fee for it, and we maintain it. If the light goes out, you call us and we come out and fix it. I recently got to answer the call for one such request and the story follows.\n\nSo about a week before I get involved Ms Customer has called and told us the light is out. Notes on the account indicate she verbally abused the rep that answered, but whatever, we go out and fix it in two days (we quote up to 3). We get a call back from Ms customer the next day and she verbally abuses rep 2, and accusing us of not doing our job etc etc because the light is still out. We send out another order. Since it's a second order, the tech calls the customer directly as he is going out there. For whatever reason (according to the notes) she keeps describing the light as her personal light as in something inside her house, so the tech told her this isn't covered and closes the ticket. \n\nCall number 3, and this time I've drawn the short stick apparently. Her call starts with the immediate \"Get me a supervisor!\". I use my \"authentication needed before we can do anything\" go to move to keep her on the line and avoid escalation. I don't have to try to get her to talk because boy does she have an opinion about us to share. I spend 45 minutes hearing about how we are all morons, nobody is doing their job, etc etc. Every now and then she demands a supervisor again but I move to the \"Ok but first let me make sure I understand about &lt;blank&gt;\" judo moving around her attempts to escalate. She eventually starts accusing me of denying her her right to a supervisor and that's illegal and she is going to sue us for that. At this point, I'm avoiding escalating her just to spite her. I calmly explain that there is no legal right to a supervisor and I am already emailing the engineer in her area to personally see to this light and resolve everything with her in person, and a supervisor in our call center can't do anything more for her than that. She starts cussing me out. Finally! I give her the shortest warning I've ever given a customer that went something like \"If you cuss again I will hang up\". She of course immediately cussed some more, and I instantly dropped the call.\n\nI'm a man of my word though, so I email the appropriate people and the ball got rolling to figure out what was wrong with this light. In the one day it takes for the engineer to get out there and handle this special case, she calls in multiple times and verbally abuses every rep she gets. Her account gets marked and a team lead takes over communications regarding this account, adding me to the email chain between the different people in the different departments since I made first contact with our service side. \n\nSo how does this tale end? Well as it turns out, the engineer's investigation came up with a simple explanation why the light wasn't working. Ms Customer wasn't at the house for the week this has been going on. She was calling us saying the light was off because she has a security camera that points out to the front yard that she accesses remotely to view her property. The light does point to the front yard, but Ms Customer's tree that she has planted under it has grown so tall that it's blocking the light. The light was working the whole time. Ms Customer was contacted, told this (and that the tree trimming is her responsibility), and the matter is now finally closed. Just in case she claims we are lying, pictures were taken of the light on and working behind the tree.\n\nTL;DR Customer complaining her light is out, but it was actually her tree covering the light the whole time.

        "text": "* Tricking us into signing stricter contracts\n\nThe information on the job offer was that we were working from nine until five, with two fifteen minute breaks and an hour for lunch, which lasted a whole fortnight. When the contracts were handed round, we were told they were generic company-wide contracts they needed us to sign quickly so they could continue with confidential training, and they would be updated to reflect our actual hours. Two weeks later they 'updated' the contracts by literally changing the job title. We're now working shift work anywhere from 6-2:30 to 11:30-8, with half an hour for lunch and no breaks unless you work half an hour longer.\n\n* Giving no training to the first wave of employees\n\nI was in the first of five waves of new employees, and we received four days of bumbling training in the training room before being removed to make room for the next wave to train. The training manager told us we were the guinea pigs for the new training plan, which mainly comprised of vaguely describing the part of the system that we would use without using the phones and without covering the separate part of the system the clients would use or the other separate part the freelancers would use that we were expected to be tech support for. The rest of our 'training' was assisting with admin for the other contracts the company had that we also weren't trained on.\n\n* Trying to force employees to ask permission to use the toilets.\n\nThe contact-centre has the most traffic in the company (about 110-140 calls per agent per day) which means calls are usually queuing. This problem is exacerbated by us battery chickens occasionally needing to use the toilet for five minutes, leading to a new initiative where senior team members attempt to prevent people from using the toilets and more or less intimidate them into asking permission to go during times of heavy traffic.\n\n'Times of heavy traffic' are defined as from 9 o'clock until four o'clock by the company. As a human being with rights, I do not fucking abide by this, and it also resulted in the hospitalisation of a team member with IBS.\n\n* Not paying the freelancers and then closing the department that deals with payment that they all want to speak to\n\nThe financial department had ignored their email inbox for months, and two freelancer paydays since then have passed and they are still dealing with the backlog. To lessen their load, they switched off their phones so nobody could contact them, which meant that we at the contact-centre were forced to deal with hundreds more calls from freelancers wanting to speak to finance and all we could tell them was to send emails that they would never receive replies to. Meanwhile, the freelancers are still unpaid from November, and as one of the people having to fob them off, I'm receiving so much abuse that I find it difficult to eat and sleep from stress.\n\n*  Crowing over the one day that we've actually hit our targets\n\nWe actually managed to hit our call targets once, which would have been rewarding if it weren't for the management and senior team sending out an email to the company saying how proud they were of - wait for it - *themselves* for trying new strategies to beat the queues. Their strategy consisted of walking round and yelling at everyone whenever a call was queuing, which ironically made the calls last longer as nobody could hear what the fuck the person calling was saying.\n\nAlso:\n\n* discussing employees performance in front of other employees \n\n* never actually giving any feedback that isn't negative\n\n* treating medical emergencies like asthma attacks or ibs as a deliberate lowering of performance to be worked on\n\n* operating a clean desks security policy but not providing any fucking drawers???\n\n*making one inbound centre for all elements of the contract from tech support to bookings to queries to switchboard and staffing it with eight people while other employees are sat idle in other departments\n\n* members of the senior team befriending members of the battery farm and allowing them to sit in acw on their mobile whilst also yelling at other, less valued members of the concentration camp for checking their mobiles between calls\n\n* actually never taking calls when somebody requests to speak to a manager\n\nWhat sorts of fuckery do your esteemed seniors pull?",

However, we have some more uncommon products as well, including candy, snacks, coffee, etc. etc.\n\nBetween December 19th and January 5th, we received 20 orders for approximately 200 different line items (about 10 different products per order ranging from 12 to 500 individual items of each). These orders quickly spiraled into the tens of thousands of dollars. However, when we followed up with the customer to provide a logo or payment for any of these items, we were not getting any response.\n\nThis isn't the first time something like this has happened, so I quickly realized the account seemed fraudulent and we simply started cancelling the orders as quickly as they could come in. However, this customer was not to be deterred. Orders kept coming, and occasionally they would mention wanting to receive the items before she paid for them.\n\nNow, our site does mention a couple of stipulations. **One**, *you will not be charged until the order has shipped.* **Two**, *if your event is missed because we didn't ship the order on time, your order is free.*\n\nHowever, we do require a credit card be provided to get the order out to production (or you can be invoiced if your company has good credit history) and we will charge the card once it's completed.\n\nNow, the customer goes into super-detective, Grade-A lawyer mode. She uses our online chat system to register her complaints.\n\n&gt;Customer:  What is up with your comment page? I want to make a complaint due to i made a onvoice where i can order as much as i want and pay it up as one payment. Now i cant get nothing\n\n&gt;Very Patient Sales Rep (VPSR):  comment are added to our website, when you respond to the emailed survey\n You would not be able to just write a comment on a random item.\n\n&gt;Cust: I love what i see in your products. But i eant to order things for all my employees to have things they cant afford\n\n&gt;Cust:  But i want to order alot of things at one time. Are u going to stop me from doing that\n I never get a survey sent to my email.\n\n&gt;VPSR:  We work with different production centers all over the US and Canada. Different items have different minimum orders.  \n Are you saying the items you would like to order have too high of a minimum order?\n\n&gt;Cust:  I order the smallest amount that i can get. I only have 50 employees. But i want them to have shirts &amp; shorts &amp; sweat pants for our baseball team for the summer. Sweat pants for home. Different sturdy coffee travel mugs for traveling for our office. Sweets to enjoy for our meetings. Profolios for the meetings. Can u help me.\n\n&gt;VPSR: Most of the apparel items have a minimum order between  6 and 18  So you should be able to find something\n\n&gt;Cust:  Yes when there is 50 Employees for my office. We are called the Helping Hands\n\n&gt;VPSR:  Depending on the mug you choose  we have options with a low minimum  But you may pay more for a quantity of 50 than you would for an order of 72\n\n&gt;Cust:  How can i get these items when i want to use my invoice. I just opened this company a month ago.\n I only need 50.\n I want to start account with your company\n\n&gt;Cust:  Send me info to (customername2016)@yahoo.com thank you kindly for helping me\n\n&gt;Cust:  There is a meeting coming up on Jan 9th 2017. Can i get the items by then. How much can i spend at once\n\nOur sales rep then goes on to explain the credit application process and the customer disconnects.\n\nNot to be deterred, this customer decides to put on their \"Lawyer\" hat and sends us the following email:\n\n&gt;From: (Customername2016)@yahoo.com\n\n&gt;My name is Attorney (Randomname1) Your company's policy is not perfect. My client (Customername) &amp; I ordered items and never received nothing for my meetings. You have till noon tomorrow which is Friday the 6th 2017 to have everything sent to Ms (Customername). Now since we where promised everything then i would pay the invoice by Jefferey. \n\n(I have no idea who Jefferey is supposed to be)\n\n&gt;Now we owe nothing. Its free due to Jefferey promised me order first of all orders. You have to go back on first order &amp; go from there. Charge Jefferey for telling us something &amp; it didnt happen. You all messed up my meetings &amp; had nothing for it. We will be waiting for our free items &amp; the count we ordered. Thank you Attorney (Randomname1) &amp; client (Customername) Attorney Office of (Randomname1) &amp; (Randomname2).\n\n&gt;Sent from Yahoo Mail on Android.\n\n\n\nTried to Google the attorney, nothing. Tried to google the customer's \"company\", nothing.\n\nKeep trying, lady. You're not getting gummy bears, pretzels, Hershey's kisses, flashlights, knives, lighters, coolers, t-shirts, or any of the other 200 items you decided you wanted to receive before you paid for them.",

I work customer service for a \"luxury\" car brand, meaning we get a lot of people who purchase our vehicles second or third hand and then expect to be catered to on bended knee.\n\nSo one of these guys calls in, and right away I know I'm in for an extended argument because he starts off with \"your dealerships are fucking incompetent, and you need to fix this right fucking now.\" Sure buddy, let me just reach into my drawer and grab my magic wand. \n\nSo turns out Asshole McDickpants owns four of our cars, none of which he bought new, or even from a dealer, so neither our independently owned dealers or our parent company has seen a dime from this guy, yet of course because this is a \"luxury\" brand, we absolutely must drop everything and cater to his every whim, for he is Lord Almighty McDickpants, king of the used luxury cars, and all must bow and bask within his glory.\n\nSo, Mr. McDickpants is angry because his brakes make noise. No shit, they're metallic brakes designed to stop your car on a dime, you listen to a Porsche, Lambourghini, Ferrari, they all have brakes that make noise too, and those are much nicer cars than what you're driving.\n\nNo, but see, it's the dealer's fault, and Lord High McDickpants doesn't want to deal with them anymore. Fine, whatever, there's another dealer, looks like they're even closer to your house.\n\nNope, not acceptable, that dealer did something awful that displeased the good Lord, and he shall not deign to set foot inside their pestilential residence of vehicle servicehood. Fine, how about the one in this town, still very close to you. Again, no, they somehow serviced his fourthhand car incorrectly and he will never speak to them again.\n\nYou're all smart cookies, you see a pattern developing here.\n\nLadies and gentlemen of /r/talesfromcallcenters, this wonderful slice of humanity was from the Chicagoland area, which I don't mind revealing to you because it's a huge area, and I really need to give you a sense of scale. By the time we had found a dealer that had not thrown away his business forever and ever and ever, I was sending him to Milwaukee. For those of you unfamiliar with Midwestern geography, that dealership was more than 100 miles away from the original dealer he had a problem with. We also eliminated NINE other service centers. NINE. Now, I get complaints about dealers all day long, but this just takes the fucking cake. I was on the phone with this guy for half a fucking hour listening to him bitch about each little perceived slight that the various service technicians have given him at dealerships all along the coast of Lake Michigan. \n\nNever has the phrase \"when you meet an asshole, you met an asshole, but when you only meet assholes, you're the asshole\" rung more true. I just wish I had the ability to show him what was going on without being fired for it.",

I was really hoping that taking a 4 day weekend and coming back fresh would recharge me, but nope things are the same as they ever were. \n\nAnyway, onto the new book. He seems to think that reading the book simply makes him a good leader, in the same way that my mom thinks reading the bible makes her a good Catholic, you eventually have to follow through with the lessons. the manager seems to read a chapter and then just tell us about the chapter, he keeps saying things like 'the  employees' instead of actually addressing us while he's talking at us. I kinda appreciate that he's trying, but this whole thing is going to wear thin pretty quickly. I don't know if he's gunning for a promotion or something, but he's been stricter on the rules since coming back to it. Hopefully he drops it soon. ",

        "text": "So this is 90% frustrating with the customer, and 10% frustration with colleagues.\n\nI got a call from a guy who had just moved into a brand new home in a brand new neighborhood, and he wanted cable/internet service. He came on the line already angry because, according to him, he had spoken with five different reps who told him the same thing: you cannot get service. \n\nAh! BUT, he exclaims, my neighbors have pending installs.\n\nOur process for new builds is simple -- get his address, the address of one or two neighbors who have service, submit it to engineering to confirm we can bring service there, get a yes, and voila! Service Installed: Achievement Unlocked.\n\nOnly engineering should approve these addresses. But some people in my center still have access to approve addresses despite having no idea if they are legitimate. So people who have that access approved those other orders, without verifying *at all in any way* if we even had services available.\n\nI told the guy I would call him back as soon as I had the full story from engineering. \n\nEngineering gets back to me and basically says, \"Um, no. Not only no, but we need to cancel every single order for this neighborhood - we have no idea when we will service this area.\"\n\nI call the customer back, understanding his frustrating at being misled, and enter into this back and forth:\n\n**Me**: I am very sorry, but we don't have the services available there. We do hope to have it soon, but it isn't something that can be forced along. I am very sorry it took some time to get this confirmed, but there is no way to issue an order for services.\n\n**Cst**: But my neighbors have orders ready to go.\n\n**Me**: Engineering will be reaching out to them directly to tell them the same thing. It isn't just you.\n\n**Cst**: No. This is bullshit. I can see the lines. You are installing this today. \n\n**Me**: I cannot put an order for what doesn't exist. There is no service to your area, and I am very sorry for that.\n\n**Cst**: Fucking bullshit. Put in my order, and give me the number to talk to your engineers.\n\n**Me**: Sir, there is no number for them. They don't work with customers. I am very sorry, but this cannot be done. I cannot place an order.\n\n**Cst**: You're a fucking idiot --\n\n**Me:** I do understand you are frustrated --\n\n**Cst**: You don't know shit, and the people you have talked to don't know shit. I am getting my services installed THIS WEEK, and you're going to get me that number.\n\n**Me**: With all due respect, neither of those things are happening, sir. We simply do not service your area. We will call you as soon as we do. \n\nThis back and forth went on for *forty five minutes*. My micromanaging supervisor was hovering over me, demanding to know why I was still on the callback, telling me I am wasting my time. I can't hang up -- no matter how combative the customer gets, there is no situation in which I can hang up. I can only repeat the same information.\n\nAnd then he went across the street to get his neighbor, simply to make me tell that customer the same information. \n\nThe entire call took two hours. They had me on speaker, screaming at me, demanding phone numbers that don't exist (for fuck's sake, even I don't have the number to engineering) and calling me an idiot. At no point did they ask for a manager, so I couldn't even transfer them off.\n\nAnd to top it all off, at the end of the call, I had to have a session with my sup for him to remind me to not \"waste time on calls you can't get sales on\". As if I had any control over any aspect of this.\n\nI almost hugged my bottle of wine when I got home. This job makes me drink. ",

        "text": "This all started last week, when I took over an escalation from a T1 agent; the customer (which we will call Raging Cunt) was pretty angry (with reason) because her insurance plan was accidentally terminated by her employer during a system update. She had already done her part, had her HR contact us and reinstate the coverage, however there were some system issues that prevented us from getting the update done right away (which, at the time, I wasn't aware of). Her HR also took the liberty of assuring her, after they called, that it was taken care of and her unpaid claim would be paid in 24h as a rush...  \nSo I take it over, I told her I would handle her case as a priority, would look into what was done with her HR and why it's not active yet and would call her back in 2 days at the latest with an update.   \nTwo days later (last Friday), I called her back, left her a message to let her know that it's taking a bit longer than I thought to get everything fixed since I have to get other departments involved and it's a system issue, but that I'm still handling her file as a priority and I should be getting an answer back that day or today, at which point I will follow up with her again. In the meantime, she called me back that day and left me a message and called me back this morning, 3 times, left me 2 more messages...  \nFast forward to this morning, when my TL tells me to log out and come see her ASAP...Apparently, Raging Cunt took it upon herself to find our CEO's email and wrote him a nice, long, detailed email about how it's appalling that I can't fix her problem right away, it should be easy enough to solve and I'm purposely ignoring her calls and not returning them...So this trickled down to all management levels, eventually made it to my TL, with whom I had a half-hour meeting about this and had to give a complete and detailed report to of what was done. She saw I followed all steps and procedures correctly, wrote back to management with my report and took my defence. It didn't quite end there though...  \nMy TL's manager got involved as well, she said that she spoke to the director that was going to call RC back and he wants me to conference in on the call, and not as a silent listener...Great...  \nSo he calls RC back, tells her I'm on the line as well, at which point, it turned into a pretty uncomfortable 10 minutes of getting utterly shit on by the client while she's asking me to justify why I didn't answer her calls/didn't return her voicemails right away. She also decided to complain that my answering message is 1st in French, then in English and it was an inconvenience for her...(which is our standard format seeing as we deal with both ango and francophones). All the director did was apologize without really taking my defence, though I could tell he somewhat felt bad for me, considering I had done my job.    \nSure, internally, I get off scot-free because I did everything by the book, but it was probably the shittiest 1st day back from holidays I ever had and I was definitely not prepared for that kind of a shit-storm. It probably doesn't help that my desk is right between the Support team manager and the call center manager's offices and I heard my name being mentioned a couple of times by both of them today in the context of this issue, which always stresses the life out of me.  \nSorry for the wall of text, I just wanted to share a lesson learned with you awesome people and hopefully, your work year started on a better foot than mine!

They also added a neat feature where we could remote into the customer's computer to see exactly what they were seeing. \n\nWell, I got a chat from some guy who was having trouble ordering from the Chinese restaurant he wanted.

Could you give me permission to remote into your desktop? This way I can see exactly what's happening.\n\nGG - No. This is my private computer. \n\nMe - Oh absolutely. I would only be able to look at our website on your screen. \n\nGG - I'm not comfortable with that. \n\nMe - Well, I'm not sure how I can help you if you aren't willing to call in and if I can't view our website on your browser. Would you prefer that I give you a call instead?\n\nGG - NO! What do they even pay you for?\n\nGG disconnects the chat.

        "text": "Hey guys, been awhile since I've shared a story.  I'm currently taking calls for Verizon so here's a story from today. \n\nThis caller we'll refer to as OB:  Old bitch. OB is from the north east and I'm sorry if you are from that area of the country but why are you guys such assholes, like damn chill the fuck out.\n\nOB:  I'm calling in because you people are constantly messing up my bill and this is getting fucking ridiculous!\n\nMe:  *internally screaming* I'm so sorry about the billing concerns, I know that is frustrating, let's look into your bill and find out what's going on.\n\nI'm usually looking for overage charges, activation fees, new upgrades or anything beyond normal charges.  Her only bill changes is every month for the past three months she's upgraded a line on her account to a new device payment agreement, literally no extra fees.\n\nOB:  Well you better fix it because I'm not paying this bill.  (Cool I don't really care)\n\nMe:  Absolutely, so here's what I'm seeing after reviewing your bill I don't see any additional charges to your account. I do see over the past few months there have been upgrades to your lines, are you aware of this and the monthly costs for these devices?\n\nOB:  Of course I am, I upgraded them didn't I?!  You must think I'm an idiot! (Yeah) I want the bill I was promised!  I was promised $260 exactly each month not $300!  FIX THIS NOW!\n\nMe:  Ok ma'am, under what context was that price....\n\nOB:  I said fix it now!  I want YOU PEOPLE to go or what I was promised!  *insert 10 minute mindless rant with me trying to explain that she has monthly credits coming for trading in old devices*\n\nMe:  OB, if you would please calm down and allow me I can explain everything but if you are going to continue to shout then I cannot do my job and help you. \n\nNow at this point I'm done with this pain in my ass. I only had 2 of my 3 total surveys for the day so I was trying to be nice so if this bitch got it maybe she'd pass my survey.  I wanted to stick it to this monster.  I pulled up the last three bills, her trade in values, how month those would be in monthly credit, the plan she would need to switch to in order to have a bill at the price she wanted, her device payment agreements and explained every little detail. I mean fine print, every number, what it all meant. I probably talked for a solid 15 minutes. I thought she hung up because after all of it there was a legit 30 second silence lol. Her last sentence to me was \"ok... I'm done, good bye.\" Lmao. \n\nEssentially with her upcoming credits her bill would be close to her demanded amount but there were no notes that she was ever quoted that price. I hope she still processing all the information I gave her lmao. This isn't a bargaining company, this is the price, pay it or not it's still the price.   ",

        "text": "This actually happened a couple of weeks ago. As context (for those who haven't read my posts before) - I work an out of hours IT desk, we support multiple businesses after hours when their IT teams leave for the day.\n\nIt's 11:30 pm and I get a call through from my least favourite business we support (we have no systems access and very little in the way of documentation, their calls are renowned for being a pain in the ass to deal with).\n\nEA = Extremely affluent sounding British guy\n\n**Me:** Service desk how can I help?\n\n**EA:** Oh hello I'm not able to print\n\n**Me:** Okay, any error messages? Any signs of life from the printer?\n\n**EA:** Now hold on I'm not a computer person so you'll need to use simple terms\n\n**Me:** What happens when you print?\n\n**EA:** Nothing happens that's why I'm calling you!\n\n**Me:** Do you see any messages appear on the screen when trying to print?\n\n**EA:** No\n\n*I have a particularly low tolerance for these kinds of callers who are unable to provide even basic details. This guy was also coming across as very condescending*\n\n**Me:** Is your printer turned on? Can you see any lights?\n\n**EA:** Of course!\n\n**Me:** Can you walk me through what you generally do to print something?\n\n**EA:** I'm not a computer person so you'll need to be more clear\n\n**Me:** Tell me how you'd usually print\n\n**EA:** Look here, I don't really understand what you're asking me\n\n**Me:** What would you usually do to print?\n\n**EA:** I don't understand you\n\n**Me:** Ok sir, I'd like to connect remotely to your computer so I can see what's on the screen. Is that okay?\n\n**EA:** This is all very complicated. I'm not sure what you want to do.\n\n**Me:** I'd like to access your computer so I can see what's wrong\n\n**EA:** I'm sorry, can you explain that more clearly?\n\n**Me:** I'm not sure how much clearer I can actually be with this. I need to remotely connect to try and fix this for you\n\n**EA:** Look this is terribly unfriendly for people who aren't technically savvy like myself. Why can't you fix this?\n\n**Me:** I'm trying to help you and fix it but you haven't been able to provide a great amount of detail on the issue, so I'd like to remotely connect a take a look myself\n\n**EA:** I'm not familiar with these technical terms. This is very hard. I don't understand why we have you people if you can't help people who aren't technically savvy\n\n**Me:** I'm trying to help, however as it's out of hours our scope is limited. I need to remotely connect to see what's going on. I respect that you are not technically savvy but at the same time we do expect a certain level of existing knowledge from users in order to be able to provide our support service after hours. I can ask that the main service desk calls you back in the morning if you'd prefer? \n\n**EA:** No look this is very important and I need this fixed, how do you get on my screen?\n\n**Me:** Firstly, I need you to open a web browser or just go to Google\n\n**EA:** I JUST USE THIS FOR EMAIL WHAT ON EARTH IS A WEB BROWSER?\n\n**Me:** Do you use Google?\n\n**EA:** Yes of course I do!\n\n**Me:** Okay, please go to Google....\n\n*we spend a painful amount of time getting gotoassist working*\n\n**Me:** Thank you I'm now connected. I'm going to take a look at the printer setup now\n\n**Me:** I see the printer is reporting \"not connected\". Can you check to make sure it's plugged in please?\n\n*I Google the model number and this is an old-ass Epson printer. USB only. At this point I've had enough of this callers ineptness*\n\n**EA:** But I don't know HOW!\n\n**Me:** I'm sorry, I really can't help you with this part. You're the one physically located with the computer and the printer. Go to the printer and make sure any wires coming from it are plugged into the PC.\n\n**EA:** OK. \n\n*Several minutes later I hear the unmistakable sound of a device being connected in Windows*\n\n**Me:** Okay, the printer is now showing as connected so it looks like the plug was disconnected. Please try printing again.\n\n*EA navigates to Outlook, opens an email about discounted camping products and proceeds to print it off*\n\n**Me:** I can hear the printer in the background so it looks like we're good now?\n\n**EA:** Yes it's working but you didn't help me at all *click*\n\nEA was such a PITA. He also left gotoassist running in the background - so I spent the next half an hour inconspicuously moving his mouse each time he tried to click something before I got bored and disconnected.\n\n**PS: If you haven't already come and check out /r/callcentres!**",

We worked at the general customer support line as we were trainees.\n\n$Co = Colleague.\n$Cu = Customer. \nHere's how the call went.\n\n$Co: Hello, my name is \"Colleague\", how can I help you?\n\n$Cu: Hi, where is my cutting board?\n\n$Co: uhm..cutting...board?\n\n$Cu: Yes, I want my cutting board. Where is it?\n\n$Co: I don't know ma'am. We sell and operate digital services such as digital TV and high speed broadband. Maybe you should contact the landlord? \n\n$Cu: But it said I should call you if I needed help..\n\nLong and repetitive story short. This went on for about 20 minutes until she understood that the landlord could help her with it.\n\nTurns out she had gone down the apartment complex to the main entrance and read on two overlapping papers. The text became something along the lines of \"if you need any help just call us\" 2nd paper underneath\" (the companys support number that reached my colleague.)\n\nTL;DR: Old lady reads on two papers and thinks she can get her cutting board back by calling a broadband support.",

Why can't you just give me the discount?\n\n&gt; We need to check the details of the offer you got, before applying to a purchase. I do want to help you get your discount. Our system will allow us to make changes for online orders within a certain time. Since it seems that you are do not have the discount code with you at the moment, another way you can handle this would be price adjustment at store. Bring your order confirmation with discount code and credit card to store our people will do adjustment on the spot.\n\n&gt; Your useless! I'm disgusted by the amount of time you spent asking questions!\n\n**Headache because I can't spellcheck or grammar check customers**\n\n&gt; I truly apologize for the confusion. Once you have the actual details of the promotion our associates will be happy to apply it for you. Is there any other way I can help you today?\n\n&gt; No! This was a total waste of time!

A guy called in demanding we honor that price(Already had 8 tvs, phone, net, everything we offer.  His bill was around $280 a month.)

Screaming and yelling is all he did, refused to let me talk and saying my company will be in so much trouble if we did not honor it.  I inform him that that was sent by mistake and even says on it new customers only and that made him even more pissed.  Then said we have to give him it because us sending him that is a legally binding contract!  I asked him to read a small fine print on it, (I had a copy of flyer at my desk) and he read \"Promotion can expire at any time\". I said sorry sir the promotion ended and can no longer offer it. FUCK YOU! *hangs up*\n\nI need a beer after work.\n\nUpdate: Somewhat bad news, He called back in today and the supervisor gave him the deal but his end bill was still like $155 but they shouldn't of given him crap for how he acted.

We're outbound, we call people who have made an online application and book them into Job Centres. Being the government, the Job Centres have been closed for the holidays as you'd imagine.\n\nBecause Captain Spreadsheet in charge of planning is completely incompetent, he's greatly overestimated the number of agents needed to do the amount of work available. Know what people don't do? Apply for benefits on Christmas Day. Despite this our call centre has been open Christmas Eve, Boxing Day, yesterday and today. The Job Centres don't start back until tomorrow, and then they close again at 12pm on Friday, in short, even if there were appointments to book, most people aren't getting seen until 2017. But there aren't any appointments to book. Captain Spreadsheet has got his maths completely fucking wrong, the client have been completely silly, and out of an anticipated 1300 cases we received one. Fucking ONE.\n\nThis of course has left my employer with a bit of a problem, because when you have 70 staff show up for ten-hour shifts and there's nothing to do obviously bad times will ensue. Rather than embrace the season of goodwill and let people go home my employer has managed to orchestrate one of the greatest pieces of dickery known to man. They decided to let people go home early, but only if they agreed to work the time back in January. My employer knows that January is going to be a busy month, and they're already looking for overtime pledges, so they've managed to get rid of a bunch of people when they don't need them and will be making them work 50-hour weeks in the busiest time of the year. Of course, most of my colleagues jumped at the chance to do this, because fuck knows why. I will never comprehend why people will willingly let this company fuck them over.\n\nFor the rest of us who didn't want to work 8am - 8pm shifts for the next week it was made clear that we wouldn't be able to go home and take the time as paid holiday, nor could we take it unpaid. In short the company has paid us to sit around and do fuck all for the past three days because they can, because they've fucked up, and because their spite and pettiness knows no bounds. Rather than let people go home and be with their families they've made people hand around for a full ten-hour shift until the very last second.\n\nIf anybody reading this is considering call-centre work - don't! It's run by assholes, pitiless relentless assholes.",

        "text": "I've been in a call center nearly two years and I am literally a few days away from getting out. When I first started the job, I was nervous and lacking in confidence (as you'd expect).\n\nAbout a year or so into the job I had become very good at what I did. I was thorough, accurate and would fly through all of my performance reviews. I had shitty callers (as you get) but I felt pretty comfortable dealing with them even though they upset me a bit, they didn't bother me all that much.\n\nFast forward till now and it's like I've completely run out of f$&amp;@s to give. I'm nowhere near as thorough as I used to be. We have the option of logging customer complaints about departments in written form or just putting the caller straight through to the team leader or manager. I used to log heaps of written complaints on other people's behalf. These days I almost never do this - instead I just send them through to the manager directly as it's less work for me. I also spend more time out of the call queue doing follow up work as I found that I was getting overworked and I needed to take more time out of the queue to be able to cope.\n\nI'm finding I am getting anxiety about shitty callers again. When I started the job I was scared of people and my job often involves saying no to people about things or telling them that I can't do anything to help (which is the case as I work for a government organization and people often ring about things we have no involvement with whatsoever) plus I often have to refer people to convoluted processes to get things resolved that they find frustrating. So I had a lot of anxiety when I first started the job mainly due to lack of knowledge and confidence but as time went on I ended up becoming quite good and strong at saying no to people when necessary.\n\nBut now it's like I'm back to square one again. I'm not scared of people anymore but I'm finding it harder and harder to say no to them again as I'm once again a bundle of nerves. It's like I just can't be bothered with their reactions and listening to their issues about things anymore. I am finding I'm getting anxious about each call that comes through and if I sense a call becoming hostile I feel rising panic coming through.\n\nQuestion - is this normal? I've been horrendously overworked this year - could this be a contributing factor? Is two years about the time limit you can be in a call center? Is this just because I'm over the job and itching to get out after two years of complaints or has this place seriously frazzled me? I don't want to take any baggage with me into my promotion.\n\nAny help or advice appreciated.",

        "text": "Greetings, fellow headset wearers. \n\nI know we all love a good gripe session about the ridiculousness we have to endure as Call Center workers, plus this is a great place for support and sharing experiences for those who suffer alongside of us. However I wanted to challenge us all on something - what positives can we take out of our jobs?\n\nI have been very negative about my Call Center job as I work for a Government department and alongside dealing with daily complaints about nearly everything under the sun, we've also been horrendously understaffed for most of this year so I was answering enough calls for two people every day. I'm moving on now - I have an internal promotion and I am moving to a new department towards the end of January after taking 2 weeks leave. And yes I am counting the days!\n\nHowever, as I look back I can see some real positives from my time in this place. I used to really struggle to be firm with people and assert myself when it came to dealing with customers in the work place. However, working in a call center has forced me to toughen up and learn to stand my ground on things. My people skills are so much better than what they were when I first started. I began to see this role as more of a \"training ground\" for bigger and better things rather than as just a means to an end - a place of growth and personal development.\n\nI've also realized afresh just how far being polite to the person at the other end of the phone gets you even if you've got an issue. In my job - if people have issues but are respectful towards me, I'll go out of my way to help them. If they are rude, nasty and disrespectful I'll barely lift a finger. I'm sure others in similar organizations have the same philosophy so it's helped me further to realize that if I need something I am best to be polite to the person who can help me get it!!\n\nI've also enjoyed the banter between teammates and sharing stories of some of the more ridiculous calls. I remember once a colleague was on a call where someone was complaining there wasn't enough air in the library. I was sitting next to her and honestly burst out laughing when I heard the complaint. I wouldn't be surprised if the caller heard me but I couldn't care less - it was honestly one of the most ridiculous things I've ever heard. When we get ridiculous calls like this come through (which is pretty much every day) we all share them with one another and have a good laugh.\n\nI am glad to be leaving as I've had enough of the job after two years and I seriously need to get off the phones as the stress and constant demand of people \"wanting things\" has worn me down over time. I am tired of having to probe for further information from idiots who barely even want to tell me their name, let alone what they are calling about yet somehow expect me to help them. I am tired of being on the front lines and being the \"middle man\" between customers and other departments who often don't like to answer their phones (can't say that I blame them). I can't wait to get into my new role. But I just wanted to reflect that it hasn't been all bad and that there are some real positives that can come out of spending time working in a call center.\n\nThoughts?\n\nCheers\n\nDL\n\n",

Her policy was in cancel status and I had to call out and let her know. I was giving her a courtesy call.\n\nThis woman berated me. Writing down what she said doesn't justify her aggression. My manager listened to the call and said it was too brutal to finish it.\n\nHe said her comments were unnecessary and she had a lot of pettiness. \n\nI stuck to the script and apologised and I didn't say anything special. I just went quiet when she got ridiculous, because honestly, it was going to be like arguing with an idiot. \n\n(If you need the conclusion, she paid in full for both policies...)\n\nYou could tell she was a narcissist. She had a comment for every little thing I did. She kept telling me I couldn't do my job, I couldn't do anything right, I was stupid, I took up her time. Just think: abusive to orphans like they are in the movies. Like that. She was a nightmare. She berated me the whole time.\n\nThe whole reason I didn't really get upset was because the situation was obviously not my fault and I know I do a great job. It was more confusing than insulting. She was like \"I just can't believe you people! Always messing everything up!!\"\n\nIt was her first policy with us and it just started. Literally no time has passed and there hasn't even been time for error.\n\nSo yeah- I'm more confused than upset. \n\nAnyways, my manager told me not to let people talk to me that way. He said I need more \"fight\". \n\nHow do I learn this? What can I do to be more assertive or give more push back? \n\nIt is needed in this situation where, it was an honest mistake, human error, easy to fix, not a big deal, I did nothing wrong. This woman was just abusive. \n\nEdit: she's the most condescending person I've ever spoken to. ",

        "text": "I worked at a call center for a large insurance company. The call center was designed to be a support for the independent agents that sold this insurance company's products. THey would call with questions and/or needing help with the quoting system, what policies covered, what coverages were needed for certain things etc. \n\nWell, I had an agent call in about 5 minutes before my scheduled lunch break. I usually kept my calls short so this was not a big deal. I was also very hungry and very pregnant. \n\nThis agent was a career agent and probably very close to retirement age. He normally had an assistant or as he referred to them, \"office girls\" who handled all the computer stuff but they were all sick or on vacation. So he had to be the one to input all the information in to the computer and generate a quote. \n\nYou guys, I was on the phone with this agent for almost 2 hours. I had to tell him where to click and wait for him to huntandpeck/type in the info. I didn't have a way to remote into his computer so he had to tell me what his screen looked like and I had to guide his eyes to the right spot. \"The box in the upper right corner, no not that one, the one in the upper right corner......yes that one\". Etc etc etc. \n\nMy stomach was rumbling so loud I was sure my coworkers across the room could hear it. My blood sugar was so low I was afraid I was going to pass out when I stood up.\n\nWe FINALLY got to the end of the quote. Here, the instructions were pretty simple. Click submit and then put the quote # and a couple of other pieces of info in an email to underwriting. \n\nHe clicked submit and then I kid you not, he asked, \"How do I send an email?\" I was ready to take a cyanide pill at that point. Luckily, I was able to show him where to go and he remembered the rest at that point. \n\nMad props to all the tech support people out there. I hope you have livers of steel, because after a day of taking calls like that, the only thing left to do is drink yourself into oblivion.",

        "text": "I work at an inbound call center for Satellite TV. 90% of my calls are helping service technicians. The technicians have a different number to call then a usual customer, but sometimes the technicians give out the number for their Help Line instead of the usual customer service number. \n\nFor those of you who do not know, call center agents are based on metrics (AHT, call backs, transfers, etc). The AHT for my department is between 3-4 minutes.\nOne day a customer came through on the technicians Help Line. The customer was having technical issues, and we are required to help the customer even if they come through on the wrong line. Anyway, this man was very grouchy, very hard to help, and very stubborn. I asked him to read me what his screen said, I'll refer to him as GM and myself as CS, here's how part of the conversation went:\n\nCS: \"Sir, can you please describe to me what's on your screen? Is there a 3 or 4 digit number in the upper right hand corner?\"\n\nGM: Fuck no. Are you asking me to work for you? You do not pay me to do your job. I am not reading you what's on my screen unless you write me a check for it.\"\n\nCS: \"Sir, I understand your frustration. However to get this fixed, it does require effort from both of us. I cannot help you if you do not let me.\" \n\nGM: \"Well fuck, I guess I'll read you what it says. It says 015.\"\n\nCS: \"Great, there's a start. How long has it been like this? And do you have a signal code in the middle of your screen?\"\n\nGM: \"30 minutes, and yes, 11-11-11.\"\n\nCS: \"Okay, any bad weather in your area? Have you moved anything around? Unplugged anything?\"\n\nGM: \"No. Are you trying to put the blame on me when it's your fucking company that is fucking up?\"\n\nCS: \"Okay. Can you do me a favor?\"\n\nGM: \"No, not this time. What the fuck else do you want from me? I read you what was on my screen, so fucking fix it!!!\". \n\nAt this point, I went ahead and pulled up the available appointments on the computer, because he wasn't helping me, and I figured he'd eventually demand a technician to come to his house. There was an appointment available for that afternoon.\n\nCS: \"Sir, I am trying to fix it. But I need your help. I am not at your house to unplug this for you, I need your help.\"\n\nGM: \"No. I pay too much for this shit. Get me a technician out here.\" \n\nCS: \"Sir, you do not subscribe to the insurance plan for $8 a month. Without that, the technician cost is $95.\" \n\nAt this point, we went through a few more troubleshooting steps. And every time I asked him to do something it was literally as hard as taking candy from a 4 year old. Now it's a 30 minute long call, and I'm getting a little frustrated because it's hurting my AHT. If he hadn't have been so stubborn, we probably could've got this call over with in about 10-15 minutes. Towards the last few steps, the customer said he was doing what I told him to do, but I knew he wasn't doing it. \n\nFinally, we completed the last few steps, and we did not get it fixed. At this time, I had to actually schedule a technician. This made him furious. He was cussing me out. He was going off for another 10 minutes about how I wasted his time, how we always screw him over, how we got nothing accomplished, etc. \n\nIt turned into a sup call, so I had to transfer it to my coach. My coach scheduled the technician appointment for him, but the appointment for later that evening had already been booked, as well as the next day. The next available appointment was 3 days later because we were closed on Thanksgiving. She ended up waiving the technician visit fee. If only he had been cooperative with me, he would've had someone at his house 3 hours after he and I got off of the phone. \n\nServes him right for treating customer service like shit when they try everything they can to help you. But in the end, I really wanted to kill the technician that gave him the technician Help Line number. \n\n\n\n",

You weren't charged for December, just November.\n* Cust: But don't you find it a bit sneaky that I spend 16 years being a loyal customer and then you trick one more payment out of me before cancelling like I asked?!\n* Me: I`m running out of ways to say this, sir. You called 3 days after that payment. That payment has already been paid by the time you let us know about cancelling, plus it was for the month of November anyway. \n* Cust: So im not even getting an apology!!??\n* Me: Sir, with all due respect, there is nothing to apologise for.  We didn't know on the 28th that you were cancelling because your call hasn't happened yet.\n* Cust: FINE THEN!!! - hangs up\n\nI had to take a break after this one. I couldn't believe that I just had to spend 10 minutes explaining the concept of time to a 56 year old grown man and failed. ",

        "text": "This story's probably the only thing I have that was particularly memorable from 3 years of working for an Australian premium directory assistance line. Sure, there's the amusing drunks, wags, idiots, people who sound like they're calling from a busted payphone located halfway up a dead dog's backside (never did work out why Telstra thought that would be a profitable location, but they obviously knew better than me) and the mentally ill, plus the usual scheduling and equipment nightmares, but overall it was good money for someone fresh out of high school and looking to save up for university. I didn't have overly terrible bosses, or a moment of triumph, or even anything funny enough that I remember it the better part of a decade on. Just did my job, kept my nose (mostly) clean and got out before it sucked me in for life.\n\nBut there's one weekend that still sticks with me, particularly at the start of a new year. I can't help thinking about it when bushfire season rolls around and, having just found this sub, maybe getting it down on paper will help put it to bed. \n\nFair warning, it's a long one, and there aren't any laughs to be had here. Most of it I remember, but this is the first time I've actually tried writing it down, and for a long time I actively tried not to dwell, so I expect to have to recreate at least some of it as I think it happened.\n\n---------------------------------\n\nSaturday, February 7th, 2009\n\nJanuary 2009 had been sweltering for the south-eastern portion of the country. Victoria, South Australia, Tasmania, and bits of New South Wales had been racking up records hell west and crooked, and now that February had arrived it was only getting worse. The Bureau Of Meteorology guys had all sorts of explanations for it, but what it boiled down to was that everything down there was dry. Tinder dry. The Fire Danger Indicator (FDI) signs were pegged at EXTREME, and had been for weeks. There wouldn't be a CATASTROPHIC rating instituted until afterwards.\n\nThere'd been a couple of stories about spot fires down there in the news over the past few days, but I didn't pay them much attention. Coming off a week of earlies and being dropped into a week of lates does that to you. Down south was the last thing on my mind as I jumped in my car and headed off to start the late afternoon shift. \n\nWalking in the door, I was expecting the usual sighs of relief from the shift about to clock off, but instead got handed a memo with big, red capital letters and pointed over to the wall-mounted call monitoring board, where the usual numbers had been replaced by a live feed from what looked like the pits of hell. It took me a moment to realise it was [a town](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinglake,_Victoria). Well, what would be a town for maybe 20-30 minutes more, at most. [Victoria was on fire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Saturday_bushfires), the emergency lines were full and us, with our quick, easy to remember number and catchy ads, were now the next port of call for what felt like the entire nation.\n\nIt was the early hours of the morning when she phoned in. We were all working overtime, everybody had either been called in or wasn't coming, and most of the work was dealing with tired, stressed people trying to contact loved ones, or people who really needed to talk to qualified folks like BeyondBlue or LifeLine. I hit the button to put myself back in the queue, got the tone, gave my canned greeting and the smallest, quietest *deadest* voice I've ever heard come back to me through the headset. I'd had a couple of real emotional \"I'm going to do it, they've pushed me too far!\" types through during my tenure (I imagine everyone who's worked a line like mine gets them from time to time) but this one grabbed me - from her first word you could tell this was a lady walking a razor's edge.\n\n(Note: I don't have the exact wording anymore. This call got to me, and I'm ashamed to say I tried to put it out of my head for a long time. You'll have to take my word for it that this was near-enough what was said.) \n\n*Her:* \"Please. Please, I have to talk to someone. The lines are full, I can see it, they're all gone and I've got the kids and the car, and I don't know where he is and I'm- I'm-\"\n\n*Me:* \"Ma'am, are you alright? What's the matter? Who's all gone?\"\n\n*Her:* \"The school. The town. I can see it from the window, the fire. It's all gone, and I don't know where my husband is. He left for work this morning, and I don't know if he's still alive and I hate him for abandoning us but I shouldn't and I've got the kids in the car and I want to hurt us and I can't get through...\"\n\nThere's a moment where your world narrows down to a point. She was about two steps from doing something neither of us would ever be able to forgive, and the good news was that she still had some scrap of rational thought left to recognise that she needed to be talked out of it. The bad news was that she was right - all of the help lines in the country were backed up (they'd be that way for days afterwards), and she'd obviously heard about the fatalities that were beginning to roll in. She needed a counsellor, what she had was a tired, nervous teenager two thousand kilometers from where she was standing, car keys in hand and ready to asphyxiate herself and her kids.\n\nFuck.\n\n*Me:* \"Miss, I'm glad you called. You are right, BeyondBlue and LifeLine are busy, but I am going to stay on this line until you're feeling better. Is that okay?\"\n\n*Her:* \"You promise?\"\n\n*Me:* \"I'll stay here all night if I have to. Now, can you tell me some more about what's wrong?\"\n\nGradually, and with a lot of repetition, the story came out. She was a teacher at one of the regional schools that was unlucky enough to be caught in the middle of one of the central blazes. Which one it was I don't remember - it wasn't important. She had a house on the side of a hill with hubby and their two kids, and she could see the whole inferno from her verandah. She knew the town was either gone or in the process of going, most of her students lived down there and she had a massive case of survivor's guilt. She wasn't in immediate danger, but she couldn't get in contact with her husband, after hours of trying, and the entire situation had just pushed her too the brink. She hated him for not being there for them, hated herself for hating him for something he couldn't control, and could not believe that anyone was alive down in what was left of her town. She had the kids in the car, windows up, the keys ready and a hosepipe sitting beside her, because that was the only solution her poor brain was capable giving her after hours of this. She'd called BeyondBlue, but they were overwhelmed and after being on hold for 10 minutes she was disconnected. She tried again, didn't even get to on hold. I don't know what they feed teachers down in Victoria, but somehow she didn't give up, and she finally called the only number she could think of for when she needed help with a tricky problem. Ours.\n\nI spent 30-45 minutes with her, that morning. The average call time could go hang, and I would have fought the man or woman who tried to take that headset from me. My supervisor noticed with about 10 minutes to go, and came and sat next to me. Never said a word, just put her hand on my shoulder and listened to my attempts to convince a woman whose world was ending that she could go on, that she needed to go on, for everybody's sake.\n\nEventually, she sounded calm enough that I asked if she would like to be put through to BeyondBlue again. I did warn her that I couldn't make sure she got to anyone, but told her that if she needed it, to call us back. She was exhausted, but said thank you. She didn't sound alive yet, but she wasn't dead. More than I'd dare to hope for when she dropped into the queue. I wished her luck, skipped the canned closing line, pushed the Connect button as gently as I could, then hit Busy and collapsed into tears.\n\nOur centre set call volume records that weekend, and as the fires continued to rage I thought about her, even as the calls slowly began to head back to normal. Still do, years later. I didn't record her name or number, and I didn't hear or read anything about any deaths that matched her description or situation, so I can only guess that she made it reasonably intact through the little pocket of hell that opened up in Victoria during February 2009. \n\nThank you, lady, whoever you were and wherever you are. Thank you for calling.",

I've worked at a call center for a major clothing retailer for over a year now, and have experienced harassment from customers, ineffective management, and ridiculous audits. I thought I wasn't going to escape. That I'd be stuck working here for years, living with my mom because I can't make enough to move out. My depression became worse, and for a while, I was a real zombie. The fact it's peak season for retail also contributed to this place being a real nightmare.\n\nI never gave up looking for jobs, always keeping an eye on job boards and polishing up my resume. Well, it finally happened. I got a new full-time, insurance/benefits job lined up in January, and I just put in my two weeks yesterday. I feel like a huge weight has just been lifted off my chest, and I can actually breathe now. I've always had a mild form of depression, but now my job won't be a major stressor.\n\nI initially came here because I needed a support group, a place to vent, a place where I wasn't some disembodied voice with a headset. I don't know what I'd do if I didn't read this reddit every now and then. I wish more people knew about this line of work - I'm currently writing an essay about my experiences, and hope to publish it one day.\n\nIf you feel like you'll never leave, I did too. Just know it CAN get better, and one day you won't have to deal with shitty customers, bad managements, and terrible metrics. \n\n**tl;dr** - Don't give up. It may take months or years even, but please know it's possible. I didn't think I could ever leave, and now I am.",

        "text": "Hello Reddit. I work for a large Inbound call centre handling general banking enquiries and account management for one of the larger banking organisations. There are just over 100 staff working in my corner of the centre. Security and privacy policies involved are obviously fairly tight as we handle sensitive information. I I really need some advice on wether or not I should be reporting the out of hours team to management for what could be considered very serious breaches in company policy. \n\nTo understand my dilemma you also need to understand the office hierarchy. We have CSRs who take calls, Support Staff who assist the CSRs and perform supervisor rolls, team leaders whom we report to, a campaign manager, and then above him what I will refer to as \"Operations Management\" who are still fairly accessible.\n\nTo set the scene, the company has recently had a rather large internal security scare, policies which have always been in place have now been doubled down on and are being enforced during business hours where before they may have been overlooked. We have a strict policy of no mobile phones to be used while in the centre due to the obvious security risk, with recent events stretching to also include no pens on desks, no unnecessary paper etc etc. If you breach in these regards during hours and Support Staff or a Team Lead catch you, you probably will get away with being told to put it away unless your unlucky or a repeat offender. If someone higher up catches you it's an official warning with a second strike meaning termination (we are almost exclusively casual). \n\nSo during business hours things are usually okay. Rules get broken but not normally the \"big\" ones. Out of hours though ( Late finishers and weekend shifts ) are a totally different ballpark. There is 0 management present. The highest authority is usually a single support staff who not too long ago was just CSR like the rest of us. All rules get thrown out the window. There's a whole laundry list of minor stuff that I would consider tattling if reported, eating in the call centre, dodgy technical issues, extended breaks, lots of stuff worthy of severe verbal lashing but not much more. It's the more serious violations that I'm asking for your help with today. While management is out use of mobile phones are rampant. I know most are responsible  and probably just browsing Reddit. But this a serious concern for our management who treat us fairly well. Abuse of this policy has lead to the  point where sensitive information is clearly at risk. Wasted employees, employees coming to work under the influence of drugs or after a long night of drug abuse, or just plain stupid employees are taking photos and recording in a room full of sensitive information and are clearly risking ALL our jobs if we lose our clients contract. \n\nIn a perfect world I could just report the worst offenders to my team lead and let him settle it all out. But alas, office politics are never that simple. All the out of hours staff are super tight with the Support Staff and TLs which is how they've got away with some of their behaviour for so long. The Campaign Manager is a no go  because he literally is best friends with my Team Leader. I would have to go straight to the operational manager and request a quiet meeting to discuss this with someone who is objective to the situation and unlikely to fire me as a result , or push me into a situation so unbearable I might be forced to quit. Given other recent security concerns he is on high alert and has already reached out to us to please come to him with concerns of corruption, and while no one may be actively planning harm against the company I genuinely feel that he is unaware of the extent of what's happening and that he should be informed. \n\nSo Reddit, the million dollar question. Do I go to upper management and risk my co workers possibly finding out? Do you think I could stand to gain from the situation if I play my cards right? Should I ignore the entire situation and be content with being a phone drone for the rest of my time with the company?\n\nPlease forgive the formatting and grammar as this is a late night post made by mobile on a throw away account for obvious reasons.
