I am unable to figure out the correct answer for the last 30 years. But may be anyone of you can and let me know the solution. The guy who asked me this puzzle originally, challenged me that no one can solve this question except him and he never told me the answer. Initially I thought that this puzzle is not solvable but then few years later another person ask me a different version of the puzzle. So the puzzle is:\n\nIn an island, there is a blind (one who cannot see), a deaf (one who cannot hear/listen) and a dumb (one who cannot speak). One day, the deaf stole the blind's man ring and the dump saw this. Now how can the dump inform the blind that the deaf has stolen his ring?",

In his mind the first two numbers of the code became a two-digit-number. If you multiply this number you get a three-digit-number, which is third, 4th and 5th number of the code. And lastly, if you multiply the first (two-digit-number) with a second (three-digit-number) you get the remaining five numbers of the code (five-digit-number). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hope i made sense :) Anybody knows the answer?
