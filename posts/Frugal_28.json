By that, I mean I don't need real diamonds or want to spend $1,000 for a piece, but I also don't want cheap Amazon jewelry where the stones fall out or the silver is a thin veneer which loses it's shine after a few uses. I suppose I'm looking for the Honda or Toyota of Jewelry.\n\nMy wife has a ton of Kendra Scott. Normally I'd pay something like $50-100 for these pieces. So expensive compared to cheap jewelry, and cheap compared to expensive jewelry. But she gets years of use out of them, and the company stands behind their reputation and replaces pieces for free when they break. The only problem is it seems their style is changing and my wife isn't as big a fan of the new stuff as she is of the old, so I'm hoping someone can help me find the \"new\" Kendra.\n\nI appreciate any help y'all can provide!",

That's not to say I don't buy groceries, but too much of it goes to waste because I don't make it quickly enough or it gets put into a freezer where I find it a year later. Skyrocketing restaurant prices made me decide now was the time to try a meal subscription for a month or two to see if it would save us money and time. This is what I've found so far: \n\nPROS: \n\n\\- We get more variety than we normally get from the same ol' restaurants. \n\n\\- The meals have been very tasty, with fresh seasonings, vegetables, etc.\n\n\\- It's costing about $65 per week for the 4 serving box, which I purchased for the 2 of us because we often have my FIL over. It would normally cost us about double that to eat at typical budget sit down restaurants. \n\n\\- The food arrives on a predictable day.\n\n\\- The kit is packed in a way that's easy to store in the refrigerator. All the ingredients are lumped together in the box, like when you bring home your bagged groceries, but the box can easily slide into my refrigerator's bottom shelf. \n\n\\- You get more of some ingredients than you strictly need for the recipe, which means a few extra items that can be used for other foods or shared with friends/neighbors. For instance, if a recipe calls for 4 cloves of garlic and two of the recipes you ordered called for this, they send two heads of garlic instead of just one. \n\n\\- They added a nutrition bar gift in the box. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCONS: \n\n\\- It requires spending time making the meals - about 40-minutes to an hour so far. \n\n\\- The recipe cards were a little confusing at times, but not terribly so. I found that the steps weren't necessarily listed in the best possible order, but by reading through them carefully first, I am able to adapt them to flow a bit more smoothly.\n\n\\- The food is delivered in an easily identified box and gets left on the porch. I was home and they did not ring my doorbell, but I knew to watch for it. I will want to be here each Tuesday when it arrives. \n\n\\- You have to place your orders each time. \n\n\\- You have to use some of your own staple ingredients when a recipe calls for it, like flour, butter, and vegetable oil. However, some things they've pre-prepared, like their chicken stock is concentrated and treated so that adding water turns it into gravy.",

Looking for recommendations for plans that are reasonable and reliable.  I have looked at AAA, the cost has definitely increased since the last time I purchased the plan outside of work...also the charge to cover additional household members is quite high.",

I am fairly new to frugal living and am planning to do a no-buy month for February (which may extend into March and April and beyond...). I've been working the last month or so to really rein in my budget, and right now I have my monthly grocery budget down to around $200-$300 per month, which feeds me and my husband.\n\nThe problem is, I have both a gluten and dairy sensitivity. It's not absolutely horrible, and I can have small amounts of dairy and gluten for a few days before I get sick again. I've been spending about $50-$60 per week on groceries this month, but I've really been neglecting my gluten and dairy alternative foods, and it's starting to affect my health. I've recently discovered the small gluten-free section at Walmart, which has helped somewhat. For more dairy-free foods other than milk and yogurt alternatives (such as plant-based cheese and sour cream), I have to go to the more expensive places like Whole Foods.\n\nI recently discovered I can make my own oat milk (I have a huge supply of oats in my pantry!), so I plan on trying that. But I'd like to hear any frugal tips for a gluten- and dairy-free diet!\n\nSide note: My husband does not have any food sensitivities and will pretty much eat (almost) anything I cook.\n\nSide side note: Not looking for any medical advice for my sensitivities, just tips for reducing the cost of dairy and gluten alternative foods.",
