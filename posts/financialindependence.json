[{"title":"Glorious New Subreddit Rules and Operations for 2023","author":"Zphr","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/financialindependence\/comments\/114lw2w\/glorious_new_subreddit_rules_and_operations_for\/","text":"Hello FI friends and family! \n\nToday we are rolling out an updated set of subreddit rules and operations based on our January low-mod experiment, your feedback, and our internal review of the sub over the past few months. Our goal with these changes is to make this community a welcoming place for all FI-minded people, but to also maintain a higher level of moderation and relevancy than is expected in more general or less moderated financial subreddits. \n\nWe have no intention of becoming another version of \/r\/fire or \/r\/personalfinance, but we do intend on being more openly structured than in recent years. This is so that we can be both more welcoming to new members, but also so that there is a larger and more diverse set of relevant top-level discussions for community members to enjoy and participate in.  \n\nWe will be opening a moderation survey for the community in the coming months for feedback after we\u2019ve all had some time living in the new framework. \n\nWith all of that in mind, here is a summary of the new rules and operational changes. \n\n* A modest level of positive subreddit karma will be required to submit top-level posts, but everyone is free to comment. All post submissions that do not pass the subkarma requirement will be placed in queue to be reviewed manually by the modteam - a change from the previous \u201cstraight removal\u201d of posts that did not meet this requirement. Additionally, we are keeping the rule that any submission which gets three user reports will be temporarily removed pending manual review by the modteam. \n\n* There is now a singular rule for top-level topical moderation, which is that top-level posts are expected to be relevant in some way to the FI community and demonstrate some minimal level of effort on the part of the OP. Authors should review the FAQ\/wiki\/sidebar before posting and also consider whether their post would be better suited for FI-adjacent communities like \/r\/personalfinance, \/r\/investing, \/r\/entrepreneur, and so forth. Commonly asked questions\/topics and lower effort submissions may be allowed periodically as top-level posts in order to foster community discussion and provide a space for new users to discover core FI topics, but will more likely be removed and be redirected as needed to the FAQ, daily thread, or more appropriate subreddits. \n\n* Personalized, in-depth content will no longer be actively pushed into Weekly threads, which have been removed moving forward. The sole exception to this is self-promo content, which will continue to only be allowed within the designated Weekly Self-Promotion thread. Anything that previously went within one of the Weeklies should now be posted within either the Daily or as a top-level post, depending on how substantial the material is. \n\n* Civility is required of everyone at all times. \n\n* We have expanded the \u201cNo gender\u201d rule to be more universally applicable to all of the routine demographic characteristics many of us are familiar with from the workplace. Speaking of your own personal experience is fine, but weaponizing such against others is not. \n\n* Politics remains off-limits, but policy itself remains fine as a discussion topic.  We have reworded things a bit to make it clear that neutral passing mentions of political parties or politicians are okay. A good general rule to remember  - if you need to bring up a certain party or person, then you likely aren\u2019t trying to focus on the policy itself.  \n\nFor the most part, the sub has already been operating under similar conditions for a few weeks now and things appear to be stable.  We want to thank all of you for your regular participation in our happy community and, as always, we are only a modmail away if you feel like reaching out. \n\n-FI ModTeam \n\nPS - For those of you who prefer a visual presentation, here is a completely accurate summary of our current mod practices.  https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/jaOI4TC.mp4","upvote_ratio":0.93,"created_utc":1676644102.0},{"title":"Daily FI discussion thread - Monday, March 13, 2023","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/financialindependence\/comments\/11q4lk0\/daily_fi_discussion_thread_monday_march_13_2023\/","text":"Please  use this thread to have discussions which you don't feel warrant a new  post to the sub.

I'm *not* so sure that you're average FIRE person would?  I know many of us wouldn't mind earning that much to try and find out; but really, we've all looked at our lifestyle and came up with 'the number' haven't we?\n\nFrom my personal experience, my first salary when I graduated college was a huge boost in happiness.  I went from living below the poverty line on disability to ~ 45k \/ yr.  Not *great*, even for the time, but it was enough for me to afford quiet, safe housing, a fridge stocked with whatever I wanted, etc.  All that really only cost about half my salary, so I saved the rest.\n\nMy pay improved as I switched jobs, and at each bump, it was more of an ego boost, 'wow my skills are worth *that* much?!' than a real increase in my quality of life.  Most every extra dollar I earned simply got transferred right into my brokerage account.  If you were to give me a 500k salary, well that'd mostly just get me to RE faster.  It wouldn't make me a great deal happier in my day to day life.\n\nAm I alone in this, or do you guys feel the same?  On the other hand, maybe this paper lends more credence to the \/r\/fatFIRE crowd, and most FIRE folks would be happier if they really pushed themselves to earn more money?","upvote_ratio":0.9,"created_utc":1678636792.0},{"title":"Is there an inherent benefit to having real life responsibilities in retirement?","author":"future_pirate","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/financialindependence\/comments\/11oyagj\/is_there_an_inherent_benefit_to_having_real_life\/","text":"So let's say you've saved up $100 million and can spend $3-4 million per year for the rest of your life even if you do absolutely nothing which would provide for quite a luxurious lifestyle.

In my mind right now I am weighing it up as:\n\n**Option A.**  Have the maximum amount allowed of the bonus (\\~40k), to go straight to the 401k.  The benefit of this would be I'd hit my 401k max contributions early, and I can lower my bi-weekly contributions and have a greater pay-check on the bi-weekly period.  One disadvantage\/consideration is market timing (lump sum vs DCA in Option B)\n\n**Option B.**  Accept all the equity into a taxable account.  The benefit here is more money for any 1-5 year type purchases (down payments etc.), and a larger tax bill to plan for.\n\nI'm tempted to go with option A because an increased pay check would be nice (while I enjoy things in the present, ESPP, HSA, DCA, 401k, etc. takes its toll).\n\nYa'll are always a big help so wanted to make sure I'm not missing any blind spots in my logic!  \n\n\nFrom an FI perspective - that's my overarching goal right now, so trying to think of it from that angle, but my point is, it seems a moot point.\n\nThank you.","upvote_ratio":0.81,"created_utc":1678557517.0},{"title":"Lifestyle creep after big milestone, is this normal?","author":"Kalico29","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/financialindependence\/comments\/11o1qxh\/lifestyle_creep_after_big_milestone_is_this_normal\/","text":"I (30M) had spent the last 2.5 years living incredibly quietly and saving anything I could to build up a nest egg.

It was a train wreck. Most of the reps had no idea what I was talking about when I said I wanted to do a non-hardship in-service distribution of my after tax funds to my Roth IRA at Fidelity. I even offered them to confirmation from the last transaction I did in case that provided some clues. I was transferred from person to person without introduction, had to restate everything several times, etc. I cannot imagine doing that 26 times per year to minimize earnings on those funds.\n\nThat brings me to my question. I am considering continuing doing after tax contributions, but only doing the in service distribution quarterly (or maybe semi annually). I recognize that there is a risk that I have earning on those funds during that time, and that there is also a risk that the account loses money and I have a loss (which would be better).\n\nMy question is about how are earning treated when they are split? The last rep I talked to who could actually help me asked me if I wanted to split any earning out and have those contributed to my traditional IRA. I declined, in part because I believe that this tranche of after tax money actually declined in value, and partly because I am not sure how those are treated.\n\nIf I split the earnings out from my contributions, and send the contributions to the Roth IRA via an in-service distribution\/rollover, can I then send the earnings to my tIRA?

We aren't ready to permanently pull the plug on the working world*, but have enough invested that we are just viewing this as a way for him to take a much-needed break.  He might even turn it into a year-long sabbatical. \n\nOur respective families have always known we're frugal, but it's clear that they don't actually see how frugality translates to savings.  Very few of my family members, and none of his, seem to even consider the possibility that we might have enough savings to get us through a spell of partial unemployment**.  I don't want to disparage them, because they are sincerely concerned on our behalf, but we really don't need dozens of job postings sent our way, or anyone pulling strings to get him a random job at someone's store, or (heaven forbid) any in-laws to move in with us and help pay the bills.  We don't need to borrow money to tide us over until EI kicks in.  We'll be fine.\n\nIt's clear, though, that if any of them were in the same position, they wouldn't be.  Even the ones who bring in big paychecks- they don't seem to have a concept of actually saving for a rainy day. It worries me to think what would happen if they were in the same boat we are.  It's never been more clear to me how true it is that most people are only a paycheck away from debt, or that most people can't handle a $1000 emergency without credit cards.  It sucks, because I can't really reassure anyone without looking like I'm bragging about our bank accounts. \n\nI'm so grateful for the lessons I learned by reading the up on FIRE strategies.

It's totally possible to be FIRE'd (with a modest AGI) and for your kids to get to go to college for cheap\/free.  Note that while our AGI is quite low ($43K, 116% of FPL), the results from FAFSA (and most of the schools) should be the same moving forward as long as we keep our AGI below 175% of FPL, which for us would be $70,490 in 2023 (family of 6).  Jump ahead to the ----- if you want to skip my rambling about our details\/plans and just see the aid results, such as my son will allow me to share.  Feel free to ask questions if you like, though I may not be able to answer detailed line-item number questions based on my son's wishes.\n\n\n\nA quick note to forestall a common observation about FIRE'd folks using the FAFSA: Filling out a FAFSA is a requirement for high school graduation in our state.  In addition, many\/most merit aid programs administrated through universities require a FAFSA as well.  In general, unless you are willing to simply pay full price and block your kids from a lot of the school-administrated merit aid out there, then everyone should plan on having to fill out a FAFSA.  In addition, whatever you get in Pell grant benefits from the FAFSA will be accepted automatically on your behalf by the school.  Optional things, like loans and workstudy, will not.  In many ways FAFSA seems to be becoming more of an automatic thing like the Child Tax Credit as schools\/states seek to get maximum subsidy from the federal government.  Based on the changes made by Congress in the FAFSA Simplification Act of 2020, it seems like the feds are also on board with this.\n\nI comment pretty regularly on posts related to FIRE planning and college financial aid, but to date I have not had actual concrete results to give anyone from our own experience as a FIRE'd couple with kids going to college.  Many people have asked me, in private and in public, to share such information for their own planning purposes.  I'm going to try to do that in this post, but I am constrained by the fact that my kid does not want me sharing the detailed particulars of his finances or his school choices.  I'm more of a sharer than he is, but I obviously respect his right to privacy.  So, I offer this as the extent of what I can as an answer for all of the folks who have asked me over the last year or two.  I apologize in advance if anyone is annoyed by the constraints I have in talking about most of the actual financial aid line-items. (again, skip ahead to the ----- below if all you care about are the numbers).\n\nWe are leanFIRE'd and don't engineer our finances for AGI\/MAGI, but we naturally qualify based on our AGI under the FAFSA's old system for no asset or detailed income reporting.  Under the new system coming this October, we will qualify even quicker using only our AGI and the new auto-max FPL rule.  We have millions in assets, but they are held entirely in either qualified accounts (TIRAs, RIRAs, HSA) or in our home, so even if we did have to report assets our results would still be the same since none of those count on the FAFSA.  Our FAFSA this last October took only 5-10 minutes and we got an EFC of 0.  This coming October it should be even faster, but we'll also be doing CSS this time around too, so I'll have CSS reporting to offer up next spring.\n\nPlanning-wise, we elected not to separately save for our kids' college funding, instead choosing to sink those funds into our overall retirement funding structure, but with the ability to draw it out if needed.  We didn't use 529s since there is no tax benefit to doing so for us.  In addition, we knew that we'd be able to pass all of our Roth conversions tax-free for around the first 15 years of our retirement, so \"saving\" those same funds in our retirement accounts effectively gave us a tax savings on \"college savings\/spending\" at our top marginal federal income tax rate while working, which would have been much better than the 529 savings anyway if we did have a state income tax.\n\nAlso, we worked and put ourselves through undergrad and grad schools and we've always wanted our kids to have similar skin in the game.  They know we have the money to pay for them outright, but they also know they aren't automatically entitled to it.  We've always told them that they will work (workstudy) and take federal loans for school unless their performance in high school, which we subsidize without limit, gets them enough merit aid to not need to do so.  They also know that if they do well and make good use of their college time that we will either pay-off or take over any loans once they graduate.  Similarly, they know that if they don't do well enough in high school to earn decent merit aid, that they will bear the cost of that poor performance if they decide to go somewhere expensive and take on high amounts of private loans.  They also know that any federal loans will be their sole responsibility if they screw around in college and waste their time there.  College is an adult decision and expense and we've always been upfront that we expect them to take full ownership for their adult responsibilities, just as we both did.\n\n-----\n\nSo we have the final results from our eldest's financial aid applications this year.  He ended up being really interested in only three schools, all of which are public universities in our state of Texas that rely exclusively on FAFSA for aid determination.  Results for all of them were fairly similar overall, as might be expected given that they are all in-state public schools.\n\n* Federal Pell grant - Maximum eligibility ($7,395) at all schools, will increase each year\n\n* Federal FSEOG grant - Awarded in minor amounts at all schools.  That's normal for FSEOG though. It's usually a tiny grant, if anything at all.\n\n* Texas state TEXAS (it's an acronym) grant - Bit lower than Pell, but large at all schools.\n\n* Matching school aid grants\/tuition waivers - Ranged from about half to slightly more than the TEXAS grant amount.\n\n* Federal workstudy - Good eligibility at ($2K-$5K) at all schools, but not required to be accepted.\n\n* Federal subsidized loans - Maximum eligibility ($3,500) at all schools, but not required to be accepted.\n\n* Federal unsubsidized loans - Maximum eligibility ($2,000) at all schools, but not required to be accepted.\n\n* Private or Parent loans - Unneeded at any schools since grants and federal aid exceed cost of attendance at all schools.\n\n* Merit scholarships - Highly variable, as expected, but offered to some extent by every school.  Will offset\/eliminate workstudy and loan use.  Still waiting to hear back on several scholarships.\n\nThe net result is that at one school he got a full-ride without any loans or workstudy needed and at the other two he will have to use his some mix of workstudy and\/or federal loans.  Naturally, he wants to go the most expensive school, but he's totally fine with the financial situation and is far more concerned that he get roomed up with his buddies who are also going there for the same major.\n\nSo the ultimate result is that our being FIRE'd did not interfere with our kid being able to go to a very nice college for cheap\/free due to the way financial aid works in the US.  Next year we will see if the same holds true for our daughter who is more likely going to go to an elite CSS school, but our discussions with them so far indicate that she might do even better.  I'll be back next year to report on CSS.","upvote_ratio":0.93,"created_utc":1678299619.0},{"title":"Accepting Starting Late and Thanks to This Sub","author":"lsthomasw","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/financialindependence\/comments\/11m8uc5\/accepting_starting_late_and_thanks_to_this_sub\/","text":"I share this as a thank you to this sub, and as solidarity with anyone else who, like me, is not one of the twenty somethings who often post on here with already $500k invested. 38F, married and making over $200k\/year combined as of Fall 2022.

No college loans, we chose an affordable college (that was still a thing in early 2010's), both worked full time during college, including my master's degree, and lived at home to save expenses. However, we never really prioritized saving beyond general emergency fund and vacations or for other big expenses like home down payment and only late last year finally put a serious focus on saving for retirement. I work in non-profit (which my friends call taking a vow of poverty) and my husband is a software engineer who prefers to work for smaller orgs with interesting projects for his mental health and work\/life balance rather than chasing FAANG positions. Passing $200k income per year is quite a milestone for us. We have always saved small amounts regularly towards my husband's 401k, but thanks to YNAB, no kids, discovering and committing to ways to spend less, getting a handle on lifestyle creep, and learning from folks on this sub, we recently passed $250k combined in 401k, Roth IRA, Traditional IRA, and a brokerage account. (I do not include home value in my calculations as I am most interested in tracking liquid assets. However, I am including a best-guess mortgage payment in my FI number to match reality since I don't think this is our last home purchase.)

Alternatively, I'm wondering if we should do some IRA withdrawals (less than a full year's expenses; staying in the lower brackets) to get some money out at a low rate and \"bank it\" for future use. Or....maybe there's another strategy that makes sense that's not one of these two?  Is it as simple as looking at taxes to be paid vs ACA subsidies gained and finding the breakeven point?\n\nI don't have concerns about RMDs being too high when I get to 72 if we delay IRA withdrawals another 3 years....so that doesn't need to factor into this decision.\n\nWe're considering talking to a fee-only Financial Planner or a Tax Planner\/expert - but we're unsure which discipline is best suited for our question.

With that out of the way, I have opened a lot of possibilities for other investment routes. Overall goal is for my wife and I to retire at or around 50 years old.\n\nA year and a half ago, when my first kid was born, I set out with the goal to pay off my house. I knew this was going to be tough because we didn't plan on having my wife go back to work, and I would be the main\/only source of income. This was June of 2021. At the time, I owed 170k on the house and I started crunching the numbers to see how soon I could pay it off. I used a mortgage calculator and decided to start tossing 3k extra per month at the principle. I was able to save 1 or 2 grand extra each month on top of making the extra payments because I work as an electrician in the industrial side of the industry (almost all the overtime you can handle). \n\nFast forward to today. I owed 77k on the house and with a little over 90k to my name (thank you tax return), I sent the final payment. Now I do understand that there are way better uses of how I could have invested that money, but I am kind of aggressive when it comes to achieving goals once I have my mind set to them. After all, that's how I was able to buy the house with a 20% down payment at age 21. I was lucky at the time of buying this house, and snagged it for 230k. Today it is estimated to be valued at 460k minimum. \n\nAs I said before, I was fortunate enough to work almost as much OT as I could handle. I was able to gross 150-160k each of the last two years. This was the only way this goal was even possible and I have no plans of working 2700 to 2800 hours a year for the rest of my life. With that in mind, all future financial considerations will be based off of 110-120k a year or so.\n\nWithout a house or any car payments, I am looking for some ideas for where to toss the additional cash. First and foremost, I am finally going to start a Roth IRA and start maxing that bad boy out (been putting it off for years because I don't even know how to go about starting\/managing one). We just had our second kid, with plans for a 3rd, so a bigger house is obviously in the plans as well. The original thought was to save 20% for our down payment on a 2nd house, and rent out the first one for $2500 or so a month (California rent is kinda nuts). A down payment on a house that we can see ourselves in for a LONG time would be around 120k.\n\nAnother possibility moving forward is to actually start my own contracting company. This has been a pipe dream of mine for years, but is becoming more of a possibility with the freedom from a house payment.\n\nAs a construction worker that knows little about investing, I am VERY grateful for any insight\/advice that you guys can share.

And after buying a $15k car and taking almost a year off work to figure out how to continue my life, I'm sitting at a net worth of $270k (excluding car and other items), and with yearly expenses around $10k.\n\nI currently live with my SO, and we pay $365 a month in rent for an 800sq ft apartment. I pay 75% of rent (around $275). Rent should double in July, since we have had 100% year on year inflation and rent prices adjust once a year.\n\nOther than that, I spend $200 a month on groceries, $100 a month in insurance+utilities, and $100-$200 a month in other expenses, totalling $700-$800 a month, and I live very comfortably. We don't plan on having kids.\n\nNormally, with 10k in yearly expenses and 270k in NW, I should be able to retire, but this is not a stable economy. Over the years, the purchasing power of the USD fluctuates a lot, and I don't have the certainty that I will be able to keep this level of expenses for even the short term, as new economic policy developments could easily double my expenses.\n\nRight now I'm DCAing my money into VT over a 2 year period, and will start looking for a job next month, where I expect to make around 1k\/month (I should be able to find remote work that can pay 4-5k after getting a few years experience, since I'm an Actuary and have been doing Python\/Data Science Courses). I estimate I should be able to hit $1M by age 40 between my current capital appreciating and the estimated pay increases and savings over the next 13 years, which should be enough to comfortably retire, considering my parents have also promised me an apartment (probably worth $100-200k) when one of my grandparents die (they are in their mid-80s and worth a few million each). If my parents make decent financial decisions, I can also expect to inherit around $1-2m when they die, but that is far off in the future and a lot can happen before that, since they are in their mid 50s.\n\nSometimes I struggle with the motivation to start working again, since right now I'm over the SWR for my current expenses, but I would have to live my whole life worried about cost of living rising in this type of environment. I figure it's worth it to play it safe and work a few more years.\n\nI prefer to DCA over lump-sum for a few reasons I'd rather not get into, and I don't want to buy an apartment since I expect to get one in the next few years as I mentioned, plus my parent's money (\\~2-3m when you account for future inheritance, which would be split between my brother and I when they pass) is all tied up in real estate already.\n\nAny advice on my situation?

I'm interested in reaching early retirement, and I think I'm off to a good start. I'm having trouble wrapping my head around some of the more niche parts of strategy, and whether\/how I can reach that goal by the time my daughter graduates from high school or so.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy situation:\n\n38M\n\nDivorced dad. My daughter (only child), age 12, is with me 50% of the time. Ideally, it would be nice to reach FI when she turns 19 or somewhere around there. It lines up nicely both with being an empty-nester (hopefully), and with the end of owing her mom child support ($1k\/mo currently).\n\nSoftware Engineer with 10 years in the industry.\n\nNW: $880k\n\nSalary: $210k\n\nRSU grant: $1mm payable quarterly over the next 4 years ($250k\/yr). I assume this grant will be refreshed in coming years.\n\nESPP: My employer lets me contribute up to the federal maximum ($25k basis). I am currently doing so, and will likely reinvest the yield into my taxable brokerage account, or hold onto it to live on while maxing out my mega backdoor (MBD) contributions (more on that below).\n\nCash savings: $42k\n\n401k: $123k. 70\/30\/10 domestic\/intl\/bond split. Most of this is pre-tax, a little bit is post-tax via MBD.\n\nRoth IRA: $56k in a 90\/10 total market\/bond split\n\nTrad IRA (probably going to do a backdoor Roth conversion with this): $6500\n\nHSA: $8k in VTI\n\nTaxable brokerage: $6k in VTI\n\n529: $29k in the aggressive portfolio (70\/30 stock to bond IIRC)\n\nPrivate peer-to-peer investment: $79k. This pays over 10% interest, but I'm unable to contribute any further funds.\n\nPrimary residence: $734k Zestimate, $403k on a 2.625% conventional 30-year note (I'm 2 years in).\n\nRental property: $350k Zestimate, $169k on a 2.99% conventional 15 year note (also 2 years in). This has been rented by the same tenant for about 5 years. She is extremely reliable and doesn't ask for much. I did all of the major repairs it needed a couple years ago because I thought I would sell, but ended up not doing so. I have to do some repairs each year. The sewer backs up, the fence blows down, stuff like that. The rent income is $1250\/mo. The mortgage payment is $1650. It's cashflow negative, but I chose to do that intentionally when I refinanced on the 15-year note. More about this below.\n\nOther debts: none.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGoal: retire in or around 2030 on \\~$60k\/year. This number is pretty lean for me, and includes a mortgage payment on my primary residence. Also, pay for a sizable chunk of my daughter's college education ($100k?).\n\nCurrent savings: I plan to max out my pre-tax 401k, HSA, backdoor Roth, and add $16k to the 529. My employer 401k match is 5k. They also allow me to contribute up to the federal limit with post-tax MBD contributions, so I have that as an option going up to $38.5k. I'm currently only saving $500 per month in the MBD, as a lot of my cash flow is tied up in my ESPP plan (I'm contributing double to get the lookback for the previous year). After May, I will hit the SSI yearly limit and reduce my ESPP outlay, which will free up some cashflow. I plan to use it to increase my MBD contributions accordingly (adding \\~$2800\/mo to the MBD bucket).\n\nHousing in retirement: one problem with my overall situation is that a lot of my wealth (>$300k) is tied up in the equity of my primary residence. I would prefer to keep living in the area I do. Ideally, in this same house. However, moving into the rental (which a couple hours away and not in my preferred area) is also a possibility. I refinanced it into the 15-year note with the intention of paying down some principle early, and thus having it fully paid off by 2030. At that point, I could either collect the rent and use it to reduce the amount of assets I need to draw from, or move into the house, sell or rent my current residence, and live rent free. As far as staying where I'm at, it would also be an option to build an ADU on my lot. I imagine this would cost $150-200k or so. I could probably rent it out for $1k\/mo for now, and upon retirement, move into it and rent out the main house. This would require diverting some funds up front, but would pay off later. Finally, I could consider leveraging some of the equity in my primary residence (or other funds) to purchase another rental property, probably a condo in the my current city, with which I could play the same game of rent now, move in later. However, that would probably run me $400-500k (though I would only need the down payment).\n\nOther strategies: kinda seems like an easy way to go is just max out all of the tax-advantaged accounts available to me (around $72k annually IIRC), plan to do a ROTH ladder, put the rest into a taxable account, and deal with the real estate part when we get there. I also wonder a bit about whether I should plan to go for a leaner number ($48k?) for tax reasons. Finally, I'm not totally opposed to working a couple of extra years if I need to. I'm pretty well set up to accrue more worth in those years.\n\nI would love any advice y'all have on how I'm doing, ideal investing strategy, and what to do about the housing stuff.

I am new to the forum and I am struggling with my path and some of the mental health implications\/concerns I\u2019m having. About me: 33 year old software engineer working for large corporation for over a decade. During the past several years, I\u2019ve financially prepared myself to pivot if and\/or when I was ready. With where I am financially, I feel stronger than ever that I need to make a change. Much of this is due in part to the mental health struggles I\u2019ve had over the past several years (anxiety, panic, and depression). Increasingly, I attribute these struggles to happenings at work. I have been privileged and fortunate in that I have been able to advance quickly and earnings increased accordingly.\n\nWhen I began my career, I was excited to start and about the work I\u2019d be doing. To the extent I advanced and earned more, that was a motivator in the early days. These days, I find myself constantly comparing myself with peers (and managers) that push you to \u201chustle\u201d to be regarded as a good performer. I find it miserable, though there are occasional bright spots. On the whole, I am constantly asking \u201cwhy am I doing this \\[to myself\\]?\u201d.\n\nI am at the point of financial independence and earlier retirement if I decided to do that. I know a lot of people are (rightly so) focused on the numbers, but I will spare some of those details for now. Generally speaking, I have maintained a low cost of living (even with inflation) in a low cost area and I don\u2019t foresee relocating any time soon. My partner plans to continue working until normal retirement which also presents another challenge.\n\nWhat is cause for concern is what the next few steps look like for me. I feel myself needing a \u201cbreather\u201d beyond what work can offer me. There are options for unpaid leave for a few months, and there is also short & long term disability. Just based on what I\u2019ve read, I don\u2019t think I would qualify for the latter, and I\u2019m not sure my pride would allow me to. Even beyond an extended time off, I have a strong feeling that I would not want to return. The company is pretty stable and even with the economic conditions, layoffs\/separations aren\u2019t likely. Where I am at right now, I think it would probably be in my best interest to make a clean break, but I am open to what others suggest in a similar situation.\n\nAssuming I make it past that step, my next hurdle is what is \u201cnext\u201d. When I talk to most people (including my partner), the solution is always to start something new. While I don\u2019t disagree, it is often framed around \u201cwhat are you going to do next \\[for work\\]?\u201d. This is at odds with how I think I will feel even after that break. I have several hobbies that will keep me busy and I plan to do a fair amount of volunteering, frequent traveling, and maybe some side work down the road. In talking to most people, they are quick to instill doubt and shame in some cases.

This is only my third year in school so I will be graduating early.

Thanks in advance.\n\nI have a question about how to structure my employer sponsored 401k contributions to take full advantage of both pre-tax and Mega Backdoor Roth contributions.\n\nContext: I make 115k, my wife makes 107k. Our expenses are around 70k so there is plenty of room to take full advantage of tax-advantaged accounts and strategies. My employer sponsored 401k offers a 4% match, and allows after tax contributions (up to 10% of your salary) with automatic Roth in-plan conversions. I started this new job Feb 21, 2023 with no other 401k contributions in the beginning of 2023, so I figure roughly 24% per paycheck going into the pre-tax bucket will max out 2023's $22,500 401k limit. There are 3 separate contribution inputs when enrolling in my plan: pre-tax, Roth, after-tax. We also should be under the $218,000 Roth IRA MAGI limit so we will max out both of our Roth IRAs (unrelated, but in case anyone suggests I should be prioritizing this).\n\nQuestion: Is it okay to contribute 24% pretax and 10% after-tax (with automatic Roth conversions) each pay period in order to take full advantage of the 4% company match, or do I need to max out the pretax portion first before doing the Mega Backdoor Roth portion? It is my understanding that the 4% match happens per paycheck, so if I tried to max out the pre-tax too early, I would be missing out on the 4% match towards the end of the year. And given there are separate inputs for the contribution %s of each, it seems like it would be okay to contribute to each one per paycheck, even before the pre-tax portion is maxed out, but I have read multiple times in other threads that you should \"max out the pretax portion first before implementing the mega backdoor Roth through after-tax\".\n\nThanks!\n\nEDIT clarifying my question:\n\nIf I contribute to after-tax (and do Roth in-plan conversions), does this eat into the $22,500 limit I can contribute pre-tax, or do the after tax contributions have no effect on that $22,500 limit? If so, is there any real reason people say to max out pretax first, or is this advice based on the assumption that someone may not have enough money to both max out pretax and also do mega backdoor roth, so the pre-tax contributions should be preferred before mega backdoor Roth is even considered?","upvote_ratio":0.67,"created_utc":1678137351.0},{"title":"Daily FI discussion thread - Monday, March 06, 2023","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/financialindependence\/comments\/11jumw3\/daily_fi_discussion_thread_monday_march_06_2023\/","text":"Please  use this thread to have discussions which you don't feel warrant a new  post to the sub.

These posts themselves are probably getting a little repetitive - but I think the results over the long term speak for themselves.\n\n**Current ages: 37 and 36**, with two elementary school kids and my sister in law who pays rent but otherwise maintains her own finances.\n\n**Combined pre-tax income**: About $259k (\\~18.9% increase). I'm an engineer, and my wife is a CPA. In very big news, my wife made partner at her firm in the past year, so she has finally shot past me in income! That's a trend that will probably continue in the future, with her having a much higher income ceiling than me. Unfortunately, it also gives her a bit of a golden handcuffs problem, because of delayed compensation structures with CPA partnerships. However, she has less desire than I do to actually RE after we hit FI, so that's not too bad of a problem to have =) \n\n**Assets:**\n\nCash\/emergency fund: \\~$62k (24% increase). We're currently piling up our cash with a plan to purchase a minivan once car prices and inventories stabilize a bit. In recent trips our current vehicles have proved to be a little cramped, especially when taking my SIL with us.\n\nTax advantaged Retirement\/HSA accounts: \\~$824k (0.49% increase). Welp, that was a ***bad*** year for investments, wasn't it? In 2022, we maxed out our 401ks, Roth IRAs, HSAs, and got matches, contributing nearly $70k to these buckets in a Sisyphean fight against negative returns. The good news is we're in a great position for whenever markets decide to improve. Also, because of our increased income, we've suspended Roth IRA contributions for 2023 in case we hit the cap. We might backdoor contributions early next year, or we might just keep throwing extra to the taxable bucket.\n\n529 accounts: \\~$59k (11.3% increase). We have a combination of prepaid plans (for in-state tuition) and 529 investments (to cover living expenses). Pretty on track for both kids.\n\nTaxable investments: \\~$57k (28% increase). With our recent raises and shifting our Roth IRA contributions over to here, we're now contributing $26k a year into this bucket on autopilot, so it's growing rapidly no matter what the market does. Additionally, we set up a [DAF](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/financialindependence\/comments\/p5ioid\/donor_advised_funds_a_lategame_strategy\/) and are now routing our charitable contributions though it to peel gains off our taxable investments, thereby limiting our tax exposure in this bucket.\n\nVehicles: $37k KBB value of three cars (8.9% increase). Second year in a row our used car values have appreciated...weird world. Planning on replacing one of them with a minivan at some point.\n\nHome: Using FHFA home index, our home value is now \\~$873k (20% increase); using Zillow, the estimate is currently $789k (4.0% increase). We use those two estimates to get a range to estimate our home's value rather than try to nail down some exact number that's going to fluctuate all the time anyways. FHFA index increased much more than Zillow this year.\n\n**Debts:**\n\nMortgage: $343k at 2.875% for 30 years (2.1% decrease). Locking in that rate in 2020 is starting to look like one of the best financial decisions we've ever made.\n\nNo other debt!\n\n**Net Worth Estimate:** **$1.57M** using Federal Reserve Home Index (\\~13.7% increase), **\\~$1.485M** using Zillow (\\~5.3% increase). Even in a terrible year for the stock market, our high savings rate is pushing us forward.\n\n**Safe Withdrawal Rate:** **$36,500** (7.35% increase). This takes our net worth, removes the home, vehicles, and college savings, and then applies a 3.75% multiplier to get an estimate for SWR.\n\n**Current plans going forward:** Keepin on keepin on. Saving up for the minivan, piling everything we can into the taxable bucket, enjoying life.\n\n**Not included**: Just figured it's worth pointing out that we didn't include Social Security for either of us, which I'll estimate at about \\~$40-50k\/year total. I'll also be eligible for a small defined benefit pension in my 60's for another \\~$20k-$25k\/year. I consider these as safety factors in case something goes horribly wrong.","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1677942761.0},{"title":"PF Junkie to FIRE - 1st Post","author":"pogonology","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/financialindependence\/comments\/11j6xak\/pf_junkie_to_fire_1st_post\/","text":"I\u2019ve always been a huge personal finance nerd \u2013 I started in the PF sub and realized over the past few years that there\u2019s a real chance of FIRE for us with the right planning\/consideration. A bit of background \u2013 my wife and I both started in nonprofits before making career pivots into the roles we have now. As a result, our earning power increased dramatically over the last three years, particularly acutely in the last year. \n\nWe\u2019ve been on a financial tightrope in the last two years at the same time: we bought a condo, renovated that condo, got married and I started a part-time MBA program. We\u2019ve successfully navigated to the other side with no debt (sans a mortgage and student loans for the MBA) and are now able to truly start saving. \n\nI will happily admit to being inspired by \/u\/MrWookieMustache, and so any formatting that looks familiar is specifically because I stole it. Thank you! \n&nbsp;\n\n**Current ages:** 28 and 29 (turning 30 in a few months), with a dog. Planning on starting a family in 2 \u2013 3 years, may get a second dog before kid #1. \n&nbsp;\n\n**Combined pre-tax income:** $274k base as of this month, $28k possible bonus, negligible RSU vest value over the year (call it $310-$315k TC). I\u2019m in product management, she\u2019s in customer success. My wife just started a new job a month or so ago, and I\u2019ve been in my role for a little over a year. \n&nbsp;\n\nFor context my yearly salary trajectory was the following (from memory, may be off slightly): \n&nbsp;\n\n*2015: $31k\n\n*2016: $42k\n\n*2017: $45k\n\n*2018: $50k\n\n*2019: $75k\n\n*2020: $86k\n\n*2021: $92k\n\n*2022: $130k\n\n*2023: $154k\n&nbsp;\n\n**Assets:**\n&nbsp;\n\n**Cash\/Emergency Fund:** $9k in emergency savings, $10k in checking that\u2019s assigned to various fixed\/living\/true expenses throughout the year. This is our #1 priority for the year \u2013 we\u2019re adding $2k\/mo in emergency savings with a goal of getting this to $30K (6mo bare bones expenses) by the end of the year. \n&nbsp;\n\n**Tax-Advantaged Retirement\/HSA Accounts:** ~$142K across my 401k and Roth-IRA, her 401k\/Roth IRA\/Traditional IRA and an HSA that I just started this past year. We\u2019ll be consolidating her Traditional IRA into her 401k to prep for back-door Roth contributions this year. We pulled ~$40k from Roth IRA principal in 2021 to help with the renovations. Looking back, we would have handled renovations much differently, but I\u2019ll touch on that in the condo section \u2013 we at least pulled that $40k at the height of the market! \n\nThis is the first year we\u2019ll be maxing out our 401ks, Roth IRAs, and HSA. I have a 3% 401k match that vests over 4 years, she doesn\u2019t have a match at all (true start-up). We have $2k in cash for the backdoor and have all the above saving on autopilot. I was pretty good about retirement savings even in my early years (have a lot to thank my parents for here \u2013 like paying for my car insurance the first few years out of school), whereas my wife focused more on having a solid cash savings buffer. We\u2019ll obviously be okay in the long run, but it will be nice to see where these accounts land at the end of the year.  \n&nbsp;\n\n**Taxable Investments:** Nothing here at the moment. I used to have a brokerage account with $5-10k in it but zeroed it out for the renovations. Once we hit our emergency savings goal we\u2019ll start putting some of that $2k\/mo into this bucket. \n&nbsp;\n\n**Vehicle:** Currently driving a 2010 with 175k miles into the ground. All things considered it\u2019s running well - the hope is to get it to 200k miles, which is a race against rust. We plan to buy a new car (either brand new or new to us depending on how the used car market trends) in January 2024, using my wife\u2019s bonus as the down payment if all goes according to plan. If it doesn\u2019t, we can go a few months without a car while we sort out how we\u2019d want to approach it. \n&nbsp;\n\n**Home:** We live in a VHCOL area. We bought our condo for $600k with 10% down at 3.25% in 2021. We gut renovated it for ~$150k. Looking back, we would have done everything completely differently, but can\u2019t do anything about it now. We got it appraised last year (valued $775k at peak) to remove PMI, but that was right before rates began rising. \n\nWe absolutely love how the condo turned out, love the area, and have a great mortgage rate. Unfortunately, we didn\u2019t realize how little insulation there was between us and our upstairs neighbors who have young kids, and the noise (and relationship) is borderline untenable. We\u2019re seriously considering selling once I finish my MBA and moving into my parent\u2019s for a few months while we assess other markets. They split time at the house we\u2019d move in to, so they\u2019d be there 4-6mo of the year in total if we stayed for a year, which makes it a bit more reasonable from a privacy\/space perspective. At best I think we could break even after selling the condo after 3 years of ownership, at worst it would likely be a $50k bath, accounting for sales costs, difference in mortgage\/equity vs. rent over the years, and cost of renovations. We obviously don\u2019t know what will happen in the housing market in the next year or two, but the silver lining is we\u2019ve learned much more about houses, renovations, and what\u2019s important to us for our long-term home. \n&nbsp;\n\n**Debts:**\n&nbsp;\n\n**Mortgage:** ~$521k at 3.25%, 30 year fixed. Our condo docs are incredibly anti-renter, so the option really is to sell and lose the rate if we decide we need to leave. I\u2019ve rationalized that we\u2019d be selling the condo in the next few years anyway (plan was to stay for at least 5, not 3) as there isn\u2019t really space to add kids - so in the long run, the amount of interest we\u2019d pay by selling out of this interest rate early will be a drop in the bucket. The stories we tell ourselves, right?\n&nbsp;\n\n**Student Loans:** Federal unsub loans of $20.5k, I\u2019m projecting ending school with $31k in total debt. The loans originated at 6.25% though are at 0% with the pause, we\u2019ll see how everything shakes out with the political\/judicial landscape. I plan to graduate at the latest in May of 2024, at which point that $1k\/mo in tuition will be turned to clearing the debt. If the loans start accruing 6.25% interest again, we\u2019ll shift other goals around to knock these out first. \n&nbsp;\n\n**Net Worth Estimate:** ~$312.5k using a $700k valuation for the condo. I\u2019m incredibly proud that we\u2019ll hit a 30% gross savings rate this year (excluding bonuses). \n&nbsp;\n\n**Plans Going Forward:** As mentioned, getting to $30k in emergency savings is priority #1. Otherwise, we\u2019re saving for our honeymoon at the end of this year, along with a number of other trips\/weddings. Our immediate next FIRE step is deciding what our number is, and what that means for our SWR \u2013 I think I\u2019m leaning towards $2.5m with a SWR of 4%. \n&nbsp;\n\nThanks for reading! Would love thoughts on the condo situation if anyone has any, as well as how we\u2019re trending in general.","upvote_ratio":0.51,"created_utc":1678041182.0},{"title":"FIRE in 1944","author":"wanderingmemory","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/financialindependence\/comments\/11hth9p\/fire_in_1944\/","text":"I came across the story of Anne Scheiber, an IRS auditor who retired at 51 years old in 1944.\n\nShe saved 80% of her $4000 annual income, equal to an inflation-adjusted $68k in today's dollars, was very frugal (probably too frugal by the standards of this sub!), and with a very slightly market-beating 12.5%, died in 1995 with a $22 million estate (inflation adjusted $43 million today) which she donated to scholarships for women.\n\nShe received a pension from the IRS, and as a guess from how frugal she naturally was, I'd bet that she barely withdrew from her investment portfolio at all.\n\nShe added munis to her portfolio in the 1970s, with her ending portfolio included 70% equities (many of which are still around today or merged into\/bought by existing companies) and 30% munis. Interestingly, many of the equities seem to have been picked by herself and she did not appear to ever have indexed.\n\nIf you were Anne, what would you have done differently?\n\n* We have no way of knowing whether she truly enjoyed her life even being frugal or if she could've been happier spending more money. Apparently she wore the same clothes for 50 years, which just goes to show how much more durable things were back then! My fanciful imagination says she liked lurking around shareholders' meetings, getting irrationally excited over freebies. But obviously, she could have spent a lot more money.\n* If she didn't want to spend more money after retirement, she could have retired earlier from her work. \n* She could have donated money earlier and potentially written off some taxes from her pretty hefty dividend income. \n* Indexing wasn't widely available until well into her retirement, at which point the capital gains to sell the original holdings would have been difficult to swallow for Ms Former IRS!\n* I considered whether adding bonds to her portfolio made sense given there's no need to reduce volatility, but I remembered she started adding them in the 1970s. Presumably at decently high nominal rates, so it makes some sense and she got to ride the tailwind of declining interest rates since the 1980s.\n\n[https:\/\/www.financialwisdomforum.org\/gummy-stuff\/Scheiber.htm](https:\/\/www.financialwisdomforum.org\/gummy-stuff\/Scheiber.htm)\n\n[https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Anne\\_Scheiber](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Anne_Scheiber)","upvote_ratio":0.94,"created_utc":1677916487.0},{"title":"Beyond the 4% rule","author":"Asihablozara","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/financialindependence\/comments\/11ihkcg\/beyond_the_4_rule\/","text":"I'm getting pretty close to financial independence so looking more in depth at risks after FIRE. I don't want to discuss again the 4% rule as it was discussed many times elsewhere.\nBut I wonder what people actually are doing to further decrease the risk ( there is a non negligible risk by using 4% rule that we may accept or not).\nHere are some thoughts. I am considering to do one or more of this but will love other options. Mainly from people fired or very close.\n\n1. The hated one more year- have an extra beyond the 4% and one less year to withdraw. Not crazy to me.\n\n2. Annuities- this also has no love on the FIRE community but I am considering to put some of the net worth on a fix income annuity. Even at the price of lower returns.\n\n3. Real Estate- I ha e a rental and may get another one. This, while having risks, it diversify from the stock market\n\n4. Continue working part time as contractor. If possible with very reduced hours. This is not so much for the income as to keep the ability to generate income if needed in the future. I consider this for the first few years only.\n\n\nOther ideas?\n\nFrom the posts below:\n\n5. Social security will play a role. How much to account for? Maybe worth a separate post\n\n6. Barista fire- I personally don't like that. I am lucky to have a high income now, won't like to go back to work for a low wage. I may take a teaching position at a college if really needed \n\n7. VWR- I like this idea. Not sure how this will work in practice, how do I live every year with different income?\n\n8. Bond tent- this may be useful. How does it change the 4% estimation? Now I have more bonds on the first years(instead of the 60\/40) so the 4% calculations  will vary.\n\n9. Pay the house early to reduce fix expenses.

With my house purchase and recent raise I am hoping to start moving in the direction of being more consistent with high savings rate and tracking progress to FI.\n\n**Age 35, single, no kids, 1 dog**\n\n**Pre-tax Income**: $150k, Received a good raise at end of 2022. My income has been stable but lower than I'd like for most of my career, by choice, so it was nice to finally feel like I am being well compensated. More details below.\n\n**Savings Rate**: Super happy to get 40% savings rate for the last two months (January I kinda cheated with unusual income from backdated raise payment). Hope to continue to keep that rate up while I also do some needed upgrades to my house.\n\n**Assets**: Overall net worth of about $250k without house.\n\nHome - Bought my first house Feb 2022. You can see my breakdown of first year expenses\/costs in my [FTHB post](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/FirstTimeHomeBuyer\/comments\/114q6ao\/one_year_in_my_house_review_of_the_first_year\/). I do not include house in NW graph as the Redfin\/Zillow estimates show me with $100k in net worth on my house and I find that unhelpfully inflated and more difficult to use for my goals which do not involve selling my house.\n\nMost the rest is in retirement, see graph. \n\n**Random notes on net worth\/income graphs**\n\n* 2014 taxable investments - I received a $10k college graduation gift from grandparents which they put with their financial advisor in the midst of the 2009 recession. While I really appreciated this financial foundation, I did not realize how terrible this advisor was. While happy this grew to ~$50k by 2014, it could have done much better with lower fees. Probably my biggest financial mistake to date was waiting to get that out as long as I did. I did appreciate the out of sight out of mind aspect which made it hard to spend though.\n* 2017 income\/taxes\/cap gain - I worked for free for 6 months, probably not a great financial decision (\/s). I used that time to liquidate the graduation account tax-free and shift a portion into an individual 401k.\n* 2021 Cap gain + Ira distribution - I received a 90-day eviction notice. I wasn't quite financially ready to buy a house but with super low rates and feeling emotionally ready, I decided to use the $10k IRA distribution and liquidate some investments for my down payment. The investment sale turned out to be quite well timed and locked in a 3.5% rate on my mortgage.\n* 2022 March - I'm not sure what the early 2022 bump is, that was when I was buying my house and moving money around so it may be double counting something. I need to check that data.\n\n**Notes on cash flow graph**\n\n* Feb 2022 - House purchase\n* March - June 2022 - Lots of DIY work in first few months to generally keep me at negative\/zero cash flow.\n* June 20222 - Positive cash flow\n* Jan 2023 - Backdated income payment came in January and I also did some big purchases to be at 40% cash flow.\n* Feb 2023 - First month of new higher income level and trying to get consistent savings rate, saved $3,300 that month.\n\n**Path**: I've had a bit of a bumpy career financially, mostly by choice (working for nonprofits since 2012), with inconsistent income growth. In 2018 I took over as the co-Executive Director for a new but struggling nonprofit. As you can see my income in the first few years had little growth, no retirement, and I was also dealing with mental health issues and generally very stressed, making saving a difficult priority. The nonprofit has done well and we've almost doubled our revenue every year. We're projected to have about $15million in revenue this year (up from under $500k in FY2018\/19). We brought in more in a single quarter this year than all of last year.\n\nI could easily have taken a path in tech and earned 2-3x as much (I'm experienced both as a software developer and product manager), so I do question my choices regularly. But I am happy to have helped build an organization I'm proud of and now be in a place to start moving towards FI.\n\nI've really had a lot of mental health issues over the last 7 years so it is always nice to see that I am still making some progress, even if its not as much as I'd like. And unfortunately, I've spent quite a bit of money on mental health care as well including taking 3 month leave from work in 2021.\n\n**Goals** My financial goals for this year are mostly to get a more consistent savings rate while also putting more work into my house.

They let you contribute either Roth and traditional. That's where you guys and gals come in. I know the benefits of having municipal 457b plan. You're allowed to take it whenever you leave the employer, regardless of age. I've read elsewhere that drawing your 457b early only applies without penalty if you're contributing to it \"traditionally\" as oppose to \"Roth\". If I'm not mistaken, a Roth 457b cannot be collected until 59 1\/2 years of age. \n\nI currently have $46,110 in my 457b and $11k in my 401k. I have $105k in an individual Vanguard account and about $20k for emergency. I own an home that I rent out using Airbnb with a family member and have about $50k worth of equity in, along with my prime residence which has around $70k equity. Other than the debt to the homes, I just bought a $26k van and that's all the debt I have. \n\nI have a girlfriend, and we have two kids, three and six. Lastly, my employer has a mandatory pension that I'm in. They take out 13% of my gross pay every check and apply it to the pension. When i'm 65 years old (34currently) I'll be able to collect an average (70% max) of the best 4 years salary out of my last 10 years of service. \n\nEarliest I can retire and collect is at 55 years old, but I would take a 5% hit for every year I'm not 65. Currently at $56.75\/hr with all overtime being at time and a half and emergencies being at double. Phew....being I don't want to spend my prime years working and my older years collecting, what would be my best option at creating a stop gate from my mid fifties to 65 so I don't have to die on the premise to collect what I've worked for?

Hoping to retire in 1-2 years and taking time now to plan for what that looks like. \n\nI'll list my assets, my plans, and future FIRE considerations below. This is both to share my journey and help organize my thoughts as we plan for FIRE. I'll also get into some nuances.\n\n**Our journey**:\n\nMy wife and I come from immigrant households - we were both born in another country, so we consider ourselves generation 0.5. We grew up in low-income households ($30-50k), worked throughout high school and college, and graduated from undergrad and then grad schools. I work in finance and she works in healthcare.\n\nWe've been in heavy accumulation phase for the past 7-8 years. We started with a net worth of \\~$0 (student loans canceled out our investments) in 2015 and sit around  $3.2MM today.\n\n**Our current overview and assets**:\n\n* We are currently 37 with 2 kids, a 3yo and a 6mo\n* Taxable: $574k\n   * Wife has a $200k bonus in the form of a 1% loan that would be,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 fully forgivable in 2027-2029\n   * If we FIRE early, she would have to repay this\n* Roth: $15k\n* 401k \/ IRA: $884k\n* Deferred Comp: $283k\n   * I have to work to 45 in order to control the timing and amount of this payout\n   * If I leave the employer, then this is paid out in a lump sum, W-2 wage, Jan 1 of the following year\n   * I can potentially roll this into a similar plan if I move to another employer that offers a 457 plan in CoastFIRE \n* RSUs: $70k\n   * I collect about 25% of this annually and concurrently receive a roughly equivalent new RSU grant (not a true grant since I'm forced to take it out of my bonus)\n   * If I remain with the employer until 45, these all vest, otherwise I give them up whenever I quit\n* Real Estate (gross\/equity)\n   * Primary Residence: $750k \/ $300k\n   * Secondary Residence: $550 \/ $325k\n      * In laws live here, so we can't rent it out for extra income\n   * Rentals (6 units): $1,340k \/ $430k\n   * Syndications: $460k\n* Other\n   * Venture Capital: $100k\n   * Crypto: $25k\n   * Franchise Investment: $65k (see below)\n   * Snoo: $800 (half joking, but seriously they keep their value) \n* Vehicles: 2 cars\n   * 2014 Rav4: Owned outright \\~$15,000\n   * 2022 Model Y: \\~$6,000 ($58k value, $52k financed at 1.94%)\n* NW: $3.2MM, excluding primary residence\n* My income \/ vacation: \\~$300k \/ 4 weeks\n* Her income \/ vacation: \\~$300k \/ 4 weeks\n* Dividend\/rental income: \\~$30k\n* Annual spending: \\~$134k, which includes\n   * $30k for PITI, $6k capex reserve\n   * $20k for the second residence\n\n**What is a safe withdrawal rate?** \n\n* $2.1MM is invested in the market and in syndications\n* $756k is invested in the second home and 6 rental units\n* $125k in a crypto fund and a venture fund\n   * These are binary outcomes that I'm comfortable with; 0x or 3x CoC are my assumptions. \n\n3% of the invested assets would be \\~$60,000\/year? The syndications get a little tricky since we need to make sure we're adding depreciation each year to account for the gains as projects return capital. \n\nThe rentals might add $20-30k, but the 5-unit property is financed with a commercial loan at 3.6% that is repriced in 2024. That will compress cash flow and I may sell for cash to put into a dividend fund, or 1031 the deal at that point. \n\n**Our preliminary plan**:\n\nAs you can see from the above, we have some \"silver handcuffs\" at work ($200k retention bonus, Deferred Comp, RSUs), so we can't FIRE immediately right now with our spending. \n\nOn top of this, we recently spent $65k on a franchise investment. We likely will put in another $300-$350k before it begins to cash flow. This is an investment and part of our CoastFIRE plan\/test. \n\nFrom here, we will go one of a few different directions. \n\n1. Continue working for 2-3 more years and FIRE with a little cushion. This is unlikely as we are both worn out with work and our youngest child needs a lot of attention. \n2. Take 1-2 years off and test FIRE. We are warming up to this idea, but the \"silver handcuffs\" at work need to be thought through and resolved. In theory, I could cash out my deferred comp and repay the $200k loan, but that would remove $280k+ from the assets listed above. Doable and painful, but not the end of the world. \n3. Coast FIRE. We are actively exploring this right now. \n   1. I am trying to find another more interesting position that covers our costs. \n      1. No more \\~50% marginal tax rate, need favorable cap gains treatment for investments and would like some benefits such as an EV tax rebate, child tax credit, etc. \n   2. My wife is looking at doing shift-based contracting work.\n   3. If our franchise does well and makes as little as $50k on the bottom line, then the financial calculators say our FIRE success rate is 100%. That might alter what we both decide to do next year.","upvote_ratio":0.47,"created_utc":1678039015.0},{"title":"Daily FI discussion thread - Friday, March 03, 2023","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/financialindependence\/comments\/11gwxtb\/daily_fi_discussion_thread_friday_march_03_2023\/","text":"Please  use this thread to have discussions which you don't feel warrant a new  post to the sub.

Since having our first child we combined our finances much more and are approaching this as a team 100% where as we used to track our milestones\/goals\/finances a bit more separately so we both were individually incentivized to save.\n\nSo what now? We need your help to see which of our goal budgets seem feasible so please poke holes in whatever you can or provide reassurance based on your experiences, etc. Which budget would you use and what % chance of returning to work would you believe I would have based on that budget?\n\n# Net Worth Breakdown:\n\n**Personal use assets:**\n\nPrimary Residence is \\~1.1M with 400k loan (2.75% 30 year fixed so will pay it off as slowly as possible)\n\n1 Car, paid off (worth \\~$40k). No plans for a second car as our residence is centrally located to our needs. We have bikes as back-ups.\n\nWe want to keep both the car\/house and so we don't look at them as assets that bring in money. Furthermore, we are very lean on cash currently as we have been spending all our cash on renovating this primary residence. That is finished but only have about $10k cash on hand right now after outstanding bills have been paid and that just basically is the buffer money in our bank account.\n\n*= $750k in personal assets that aren't really producing income ($700k house equity, $40k car, $10k cash).*\n\n**Passive Investments:**\n\nTaxable (Individual Tech Stocks) - $243k\n\nTaxable (Index Funds) - $103k\n\nRetirement Roth and Traditional (Index Funds) - $497k\n\nHSA (Index Funds) - $20k\n\n529 Education (Index Funds) - $14k\n\nCrypto - $201k\n\n*= $1,078,000 (consisting of $634k of Index Funds, $243k of individual stock, and $201k of crypto)*\n\nP.S. I am a huge index fund believer just like most of you. I got lucky that small investments in tech stocks\/crypto ballooned and I have just not rebalanced because I believe in the companies\/projects long-term and don't want to take the tax hit... \n\n**Investment Properties**\n\n2 properties, total of $1,000 a month positive cashflow from rents after mortgage\/maintenance if we keep them fully rented which we historically have been able to do.\n\n$1,019,000 in value against $656k of loans at \\~3% 30 year fixed with about 27 years left on average (so will pay them off as slowly as possible).\n\n*= $363,000 of investment property equity + $1,000\/month cash flow from renting them out after paying mortgages\/expenses. Would you include this equity as money you can pull against for the 4% rule?*\n\n# Goal Budgets - Which to choose?\n\nWe are an early 30s married couple with one 18 month old. Would likely want to have a second child, slight chance of a third.\n\n**ABSOLUTE LEANEST BUDGET: $54,000\/year** if we don't have any emergencies and spend on necessities only, minimal gifting, etc. We did just renovate the house thoroughly so it may be doable?\n\n**CURRENT PLANNED BUDGET: $60,000\/year** if we are careful and minimal emergencies\/issues, very thoughtful spending even on groceries... even a couple thousand a year more could give us a lot of flexibility but not sure if more is going to almost assuredly force me to find another job soon.\n\n**COMFORTABLE BUDGET:  $72,000\/year** just spending as we want as long as we find good value in the expense. A bit of cushion to bank away money for emergencies and to expand a bit more spending once we have a second child. \n\nWe know all about the 4% - 95% success for 30 year retirement but what parts of our net worth would you include in the nest egg to take 4% from and why? Our retirement goal timeline is to cover until we are in our 90s so more like a 60 year timeline for planning purposes (knock on wood). I am potentially okay with less than a 95% success rate as I can go back to work if needed. \n\n**TL;DR What amount of spending per year do you think we can afford with $1.45M invested + $1,000\/month in cashflow? Do you count investment property equity in your 4% rule calculations? Our total net worth is \\~$2.2M if you include Primary Resident\/our car's equity.

Even with company match she can only really afford to invest 490 a month. \n\nSo between the two of us we are around 55-56k.\n\nCurrently I can stand to invest 2-3k a month. While still being able to set aside around 2k a month for taxes (self employed) and ~1k a month for general savings between my wife and I (I wish I could invest all of that but it would be irresponsible in the current market). Which is huge imo. I\u2019m so blessed to have expendable income like that for the first time in my life. Through most of my 20s I lived off of 20-30k a year. It\u2019s been a grind to get here.\n\nBut also now that I\u2019ve found fire it\u2019s kind of a bummer to see that the soonest I can retire would be another 15-17 years and even this, although not lean fire\u2026would be more on the leaner end of fire once you account for inflation and a 3.5% swr\u2026 and if I want to make sure my wife can retire at the same time I do, really it would be 22-25 years. (She\u2019s cool with continuing to work until 60-65 though so that\u2019s not a necessity). \n\nIt really feels like I\u2019m stacking away some serious cash and this should all come sooner so it\u2019s a slight bummer. Especially since I don\u2019t want to lean fire. Even if I could live on 40-50k a year I\u2019d rather fire with some luxuries and cushion\/wiggle room on 80-100k a year but that easily pushes retirement to or beyond 20 years.\n\nThere are some plus sides though\u2026 over the next 5-10 years I\u2019ll have a massive cushion and should feel more financially secure than ever (to an extent I already do). I could even probably afford to invest in real estate or something like that by then or maybe even start a new business if I wanted. So that\u2019s great. \n\nIt is what it is I guess, and I\u2019m super fortunate.

I max out 401(k) for my and my spouse (41K), max out Backdoor Roths (12K), HSA (7K), and I get a pension when I turn 65 (worth about $25-30K\/year in employer contributions).

I would contribute about $43K into the Roth rather than into taxable accounts. My concern is without a sufficient taxable account buffer, I may have trouble meeting expenses from age 44 or so (hopeful FIRE age) and 59.5, and secondarily my concern is that I have less liquid assets for emergencies or private school or whatever else lifestyle inflation I may want to indulge in over the next 25 years.

I know you can draw the principle out from a Mega backdoor Roth after 5 years, but eventually the interest will be larger than the principle due to compound growth, and so I won't be able to access all of those funds in my 50s, for example.

Any feelings of inability to cross the chasm into wealth?","author":"bingbangbio","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/financialindependence\/comments\/11aiuk6\/any_henry_feelings_here_any_feelings_of_inability\/","text":"High Earner, Not Rich Yet refers to people who are\u2026making big income but aren\u2019t yet wealthy. I didn\u2019t come up with it. \n\nBut I\u2019ve been reading some interesting articles about it. An insightful one detailed HENRYs who have \u201cgiven up\u201d on becoming wealthy. Like, truly wealthy. These are people earning $300k-$500k\/year who are essentially set for life but cannot cross into living lavishly from capital appreciation alone. \n\nTalk about a rough life.\n\nBut the article was interesting cuz it pointed out a couple of things. \n\nFirst, just the general profile of these folks. At this point they\u2019re likely close to 50. They have kids in expensive schools, a big mortgage, etc and can\u2019t afford the risk, time, and energy it\u2019d take to make big big moves. Each additional dollar is taxed at marginally higher rates and overall it\u2019s just not worth pushing through the plateau. They experience feelings of finality or loss of momentum or even of settling. All their forward momentum bleeds away as it becomes increasingly expensive to live and compete at their levels. \n\nAnd second, just how wide the chasm is between the upper (labor) class and the truly wealthy. \n\nI didn\u2019t have delusions of billionaire status before. And I\u2019m on a good track towards millionaire next door status. But I still felt slight disappointment while reading some of the stats and finally internalized just how wide that gap is. Nothing a quick gratitude session didn\u2019t cure of course. \n\nAnyway, offering an excuse to pout about our lives - anyone kinda bummed about how nearly impossible it is to become rich rich?\n\nEDIT: The article is in the NYT Opinion section. I don\u2019t have a way to de-paywall it but it\u2019s called \u201c\u2018Fleishman is in Trouble\u2019 and the Angst of the Striving Upper Class\u201d. It also links out to several other articles and I read of few of them. I think it\u2019s just a general thought in the collective right now. A TikTok a while back went viral and had some good discussion about whether or not $100k is a good salary. The two sides were, yes and yes but only relatively. \n\nAlso, just for discussion\u2019s sake - I didn\u2019t quite mean being permanently disappointed in _not_ being a billionaire. I mean the realization that your incredible progress wont\u2019 get you close to where others are, realizing it\u2019s not worth further effort, and deciding to be ok. I think that\u2019s actually a very rational reaction and apparently it happens to many. In other words, I\u2019m talking about the moment(s) it becomes apparent to super ambitious people and they _do_ decide to relax instead.\n\nMoreover, I understand $300k is a fuck ton of money but just to clear up the levels that we\u2019re talking about - \u201cwealthy\u201c would be so rich that capital appreciation affords you both your ideal life (I\u2019m not talking just zip codes and vacations here, I\u2019m talking goals and endeavors) _and_ immense free time from an early point in life. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s obsessive or irrational to crave that. And yes, most of us are more fortunate than almost all humans who\u2019ve lived. I don\u2019t think that changes it.\n\nEDIT2: Thanks for all the great discussion. Don\u2019t let this edit box it in, but I wanted to clear up another point, which you can distill yourself from the article. It\u2019s not strictly an issue of lifestyle creep. The point is that at the inflection point the opportunity cost of continuing to live frugally is so high vs the tiny chance of crossing the chasm. It\u2019s actually a very rational response to then commit to private schools, nice homes, etc. In other words, frugality and ambitions gets them there, they realize how far they\u2019ve yet to go, and decide it\u2019s better to start spending more lavishly on the now. It\u2019s the opposite of keeping score.","upvote_ratio":0.8,"created_utc":1677214285.0},{"title":"Daily FI discussion thread - Friday, February 24, 2023","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/financialindependence\/comments\/11anupm\/daily_fi_discussion_thread_friday_february_24_2023\/","text":"Please  use this thread to have discussions which you don't feel warrant a new  post to the sub.

The work is hard but not miserable. \n\nQuestions 2:  You have an investment opportunity. It is semi passive. You have no cash invested. A partner puts up cash. You put up time.  You have to make weekly follows ups and answer emails and phone calls.  It requires a monthly site visit. It lasts 6 months. It is low level annoying and stressful. The return is a lump sum.

I left FT w2 1.5 years ago.  We have a total of 3 teens. LCOL rocky mountains. \n\nWe didn\u2019t really go the index route. We went the landlord route and pretty much times the market crazy perfect. I had a modest pension coming at age 57. She had a standard corporate 401k. I had always owned a duplex as supplemental income. She thought that was cool and we decided to buy a few together as retirement padding. The market was favorable and we pooled most of our cash and bought a duplex. Then another. Then we buckled down and threw every dollar into 2 more the next year. Then we started flipping and plowing the flips profits into long term rentals. Then she got her license and plowed that into rentals. \n\nOur goal was 17 doors, roughly 8-9 duplexes was kinda the thought.  The math on the cash flow in 15 years looked good. That would be manageable and a very comfortable retirement. We went with 15 year mortgages and the properties were basically cash neutral after conservatively budgeting long term. \n\nWe hit our long term FI goal, kinda. \n\nThen we were offered a trio of 4 plexes. Then a 6 unit. Then more. The prices were very good. The later units were 30 year mortgages. They did better in the near term than the initial units. Next thing we know we have 30+ units. Rates were favorable and I realized if we refinanced into 30 year fixed we would basically cash flow at or above our current household expenses. \n\nWe hit a cross roads where the side hustle was consuming our lives. Lots of midnights and weekends. I was taking vacation to renovate kitchens. The kids were growing up and resenting the houses. \n\nI put in notice at work and they asked for 6 months. Then 3 more. Then 1 more. I finally just picked a date and gave hard notice. They kept me on PT to troubleshoot issues, which I like. New boss is chill and respects that I am doing a favor, not earning real money. \n\nBut I find myself still grinding at times. We have 8x our annual expenses in cash. We have maxed all retirement contributions for a while. I\u2019m still flipping a house and added 2 more units to the portfolio in December. \n\nI have no idea what our net worth is.  Probably 2.5-3.5 million?  \n\nThe thing is that we don\u2019t live that expensive. I have fairly cheap hobbies. She has super cheap hobbies. We did buy a bigger house but it is sort of a flip too. Older cars, discount vacations. Our annual spend is 75-100k. We could trim it to 50k pretty painlessly. 100k feels absolutely luxurious. \n\nSo what are we doing?  Why am I going to lay tile today, on my own?\n\nPartly because I have a hard time spending money on stuff I can do myself. Partly because I\u2019ll do a better job. Partly because I\u2019m scared for my kids. They may never afford a house without a boost. Partly because my parents aren\u2019t in great financial shape. Part of it is wanting to build the stock portfolio to diversify away from land lord life. \n\nBut 50% of it is just greed. I can\u2019t turn down a flip that makes 50-100k in 3 months. \nShe can\u2019t turn down a client that pays 10-20k with often minimal effort. \nI added another duplex because it adds $1000 a month and I can think of many ways to enjoyably spend $1000, even though I don\u2019t. \n\nAt current trajectory we will be LCOL FATFI in 3-5 years. But I hate those guys.  I don\u2019t want a sports car or a sailboat. I hate wine and Michelin stars. I\u2019m a dirtbag who can\u2019t stop getting dirty. \n\nI have kids every other week. On my off weeks I basically work full time on projects. \n\n\nA meaningful chunk to me is 20k over 6 months. \n\nA weekend value with my kids is about $2000 and without is $750.","upvote_ratio":0.39,"created_utc":1677352858.0},{"title":"Furloughed -- job hop or travel the world?","author":"col02144","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/financialindependence\/comments\/11a5m4q\/furloughed_job_hop_or_travel_the_world\/","text":"TLDR: US. 25M. \\~$230k net worth.

April and May of last year I was still using my Crypto.com Card a little bit (more on that later...) so I'm missing a few hundred or so in expenses, mainly food \/ grocery stuff.\n\n[My Overall Expenses](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/fQcguIs.png)\n\n**Taxes:**\n\nIn 2021 I had paid around $40,000 in quarterly taxes to Federal and $8000 to State, and still ended up owing $11k Fed and $5k State.   For 2022 I was not anticipating so much \"unexpected\" income, so I paid $8k \/ $4k in quarterly estimated.   I have not done my taxes yet, so I'm not sure how close I'll end up being.\n\n**Shopping**\n\nBig ticket here was $2700 I dropped in September to fully upgrade my computer, which I hadn't done since 2017.  It's nice to have a rockin' PC, especially since so much of my time is spent on it with video games.    The other $4200 is all in \"Amazon.\"  The vast vast majority are food \/ snack \/ drink related.  I now get most of my Sugarfree Redbull (drink of choice) from cases on Amazon.   I do have some \"normal\" purchases though, like a electric kettle, household items like Ziploc bags, some clothes, mouse and mouse pad, Sony WF-1000XM4 Earbuds.\n\n**Food:**\n\nAgain a big category.  A lot of eating out, pizza every week.  I'm doing better this year though, I think I've only ordered Pizza three times since January 1st.\n\n**Health**\n\n$4200 medical insurance premiums and $340 dental insurance premium.  I didn't really use my insurance, one small Dentist bill, and went to a Chiro for a tweaked back twice.\n\n**Auto:**\n\n$1000 in gas, $1000 in auto insurance.   I drove a total of 5000 miles last year.   I did end up needing a brake job which cost $230.\n\n**Utilities:**\n\nMy electric bill is around $150 for three months of summer and closer to $50 every other month.  Gas bill is $70 or $80 in the winter months and around $20 other times.  My upgraded super fast 600 mbps Comcast costs me $65 per month, and my phone is just an added line charge on my parent's plan for $275 for the year.\n\n**Entertainment:**\n\nMan, I really need to cut some of my services I think.   Disney is $8, Netflix is $20, Spotify is $10.   Mmm, I wonder where my Prime is listed, must be up under Shopping.   Anyway, I should at least drop Netflix and Disney I think.  I have enough other stuff to watch on my Plex and I can download anything else I need.    I also spent around $200 on some video games last year.\n\n**TOTAL**\n\nSo ignoring the tax section, my total expenses were around $27,000.   Still pretty much in line with the past three years, which had expenses of $23k, $29k, and $24k.\n\n--------------------\n\n**Investments:**\n\nI'll just keep adding to the table from last year.\n\nType|Retirement Day|1 Year|2 Years|3 Years|4 Years\n:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--\n*Traditional IRA*|$299,000|$348,000|$380,170|$410,285|$360,715\n*Roth IRA*|$14,500|$18,150|$70,236|$75,800|$91,469\n*Brokerage*|$18,400|$22,900|$37,108|$179,110|$139,420\n**Total Vanguard (3 Above)**|$331,800|$389,100|$487,515|$665,195|$591,600\nOther Holdings, Crypto\/Bitcoin|$145,000|$291,000|$1,315,000|$985,000|$595,000\nHSA Investment|$6000|$7400|$8760|$9453|$9237\nCash|$20,000|$9000|$135,000|$9345|$11,785\n\nMarket's a bit down from where it was a year ago.   My \"normal\" accounts are down about $75,000 from last year and Crypto is down about $400,000 from a year ago.  I'm still doing a $20,000 per year Roth Conversion Ladder. Overall still way up from when I retired, so all's good.\n\nLast year I was involved in Crypto.com and the whole crypto yield \/ interest earning.

It works until it doesn\u2019t and then you never see your principle.*\n\n*Me: I disagree. We'll see.*\n\nWell, we saw.  Everything exploded, many people lost a lot of money.   For me, luckily, I pulled everything out.   In April or May of last year Crypto.com started **slashing** all of their Earn interest rates and it was just no longer worth it to have my crypto locked up in their system so I had everything pulled out in April\/May.   It was June when Celsius absconded with everyone's Crypto, and of course the whole FTX thing happened in November.   But I got everything out and it's all sitting in Cold Storage now, safe and sound on the blockchain.  Just goes to show that my old rationale of \"There's millions of dollars and really smart people involved in these companies, they are advertising like crazy and it's almost mainstream at this point: what could possibly go wrong\" was a bit... well, misaligned with reality.\n\n**Life Stuff**\n\nNot much to say here really, nothing much has changed.  I still haven't gone on a cruise yet (still thinking about it), and I haven't moved house (still thinking about it).   I've just been doing the same cadre of activities as always: dinner at my parents, a couple trips up to the Cabin with my college friends, playing board games and D&D, meeting up with old co-workers Quarterly.   Mustic, podcasts, video games, YouTube.  I'm cooking a bit more, and down a few pounds so that's nice too.\n\nThat's about it.  Everything is going great, still totally happy, never bored.

Our 8 year is finishing up his 1st year at a private school we were basically gifted. We could not afford it when he started ($1,400\/m). \n\nSince then I\u2019ve gotten a better job making $120k. My wife currently doesn\u2019t work, but has now been looking because of this. Next year our 3 year old daughter needs to start daycare as well ($1350\/m). Luckily my wife just found a job at a daycare that would let our daughter go for free as well as pay $14\/h, but due to the circumstances we\u2019d now be paying $1,800\/m for the private school and aftercare. My paycheck continues to pay all the bills with a small buffer and her paycheck would cover just his school and eventually she\u2019d transition to the same private school and I\u2019d cover any extra expense. \n\nThe issue here is that without private school we were set to both be retired or have an extreme ample amount of money within the next 10 years (35-40), as we currently have $400k+ net worth in real estate. Adding in the private school we\u2019re losing out on a very easy life of vacation on a whim or paying for extra sports, tutoring anything really. Private school would max us out.

I think everyone needs to find their own balance, but making FI a major goal really pushes you toward the \"save for the future\" end of the spectrum while you're in your accumulation years.  I was thinking about ways to balance out that concept in our day to day existence, but most of the talk about balancing it seems really subjective for me.  I wanted to find a way to quantify that idea of balance.\n\nThen I thought about the SSA life expectancy tables.  You can find them here.  [https:\/\/www.ssa.gov\/oact\/STATS\/table4c6.html](https:\/\/www.ssa.gov\/oact\/STATS\/table4c6.html)  It's an actuarial estimate on death probability divided into each age and split by gender for people who live in the U.S.  There might be a myriad factors that make you likely to live longer or less long than these tables suggest, but for me, I think they're good enough.\n\nI'm 27.  I turn 28 in a few months, so for simplicity let's just say I'm 28.  By that table, my life expectancy is between 49 and 50 years, but you can break it down further and get a percent chance of dying each year.\n\nI'm a tabletop roleplaying game fan.  In D&D we have the concept of a critical failure.  It's when you roll a 1 on a 20 sided die.  It's not a super common, but it's not super uncommon either.  There a 5% chance that it happens on any roll.  If you play with a group large enough and play long enough sessions, you usually see it happen to some poor unfortunate soul at least once per session.  That's the key.  It's uncommon but not astronomically so, and it happens to everyone eventually.\n\nPut these two together, and I think you get the idea of what I'm asking.  What does my life expectancy look like if I \"rolled\" a nat 1?\n\nFor me, if I did the math right, that's about 20 years.\n\nThat number has helped me reframe the way I think about life a bit.  It has \"quantified\" so to speak, the fact that there's a chance I'll die young.  It's something that's real for everyone, but I don't think we think about it that much or even really accept its reality that often.\n\nObviously, I'm not saying to build your whole life around the idea that you'll be in the bottom 5% of life expectancy from your current situation, but it's helpful to understand that it's a REAL possibility and not just some abstract idea.  At some point it will be true for you (otherwise, you'd never die), and quantifying that gives you a bit of a push to not put off the things you really want too much.\n\n**Edit: TLDR** here's the \"rule\" if that's even the right word :) \n\nUse the SSA life expectancy table to estimate your life expectancy from your current age and gender as if you will be in the bottom 5% of life expectancy.  \n\nKnow that number and take it into account in your life decisions as a sort of \"bottom\" end of what's likely.  \n\nObviously, the real bottom end is dying now, but I think 5% is a reasonable bar to quantify the idea that you might not live as long as you think.","upvote_ratio":0.79,"created_utc":1677092891.0},{"title":"Can I use Earnings Yield as the more conservative safe withdraw rate? - or use a variant of Earnings yield - adjusted for cyclicality?","author":"Previous_Ad5663","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/financialindependence\/comments\/119k91o\/can_i_use_earnings_yield_as_the_more_conservative\/","text":"In equities P\/E ratio is Price-to-Earnings ratio to measure how expensive stocks are.

My story includes only my finances as I have not combined them with my boyfriend. \n\nI had a weird relationship with money growing up. As an immigrant, my mom believed education was the way to move up, so she worked multiple jobs to pay for private school for me and my sibling. We often didn\u2019t have enough money for food. If I tried to save up birthday or Christmas money in the house, she would always find it and put it toward bills. As a kid, I used to be very resentful that we were poor while I was surrounded by rich kids at school. As an adult, I know my mom did the best she could. \n\nI got my first job in retail at 18 ($8\/hour). Made a bunch of money\/life mistakes as most do at that age. Wound up in the service industry while going to community college, then moved into an apt with my boyfriend at 22 (not the best financial decision to voluntarily start paying rent, but I have no regrets). Took me many years to transfer; when I finally did, I chose an excellent public university 2 hours away because I qualified for significant tuition waivers due to my low income. To this day, I am so grateful I didn\u2019t have to take out any student loans. I continued living with my boyfriend and commuted 2 hours each way to attend classes. It was a tough time because I was still working my service job nights and weekends to pay my half of our $2k\/month rent (HCOL area) and other bills. Also did several unpaid internships. Looking back, I\u2019m proud of myself for sticking with it.\n\n2019: Graduated college at 25 with an English degree. Many people told me it would be difficult to make money with that, but I\u2019ve known since I was a kid that I wanted to be a writer, and I chose to follow my dreams. Couldn\u2019t find a job in my field for the rest of the year so I continued working in the service industry. EOY NW: $2k\n\n2020: Landed a job! Worked as a writer ($18\/hour) at a media company and returned to commuting 4 hours\/day. Kept working my service job on weekends until Covid hit. Then, my company switched to work from home. Cannot overstate how much my quality of life increased by not having to commute anymore. Restaurants shut down, so I lost my weekend service job (never went back). After a three-month probationary period, my pay was raised to $23\/hour. During lockdown, I started learning more about personal finance on Reddit and YouTube. Decided to try and save every penny this year (not too hard due to lockdowns). EOY NW: $23k\n\n2021: Was hired full-time with a salary of $50k. Now that I had good dental insurance, I started dental work I\u2019d needed for years. Unfortunately, I made some bad single-stock investments (including buying TSLA at all-time highs) but I\u2019m glad I learned my lesson early in my FIRE journey. Mainly VTSAX and chill for me from here on out. Started to change my perspective on money a bit in that I was more willing to spend on things that mattered to me and was cheap with things that didn\u2019t. \u201cBuild the life you want and save for it\u201d and all that. I started manually tracking where every penny went in a spreadsheet, which was super helpful. EOY NW: $37k\n\n2022: Got a raise to $58k at the beginning of the year and later a raise to $63k. I finished my dental work frustrated with how little insurance actually covers. Flew to several friends\u2019 weddings as they\u2019d been postponed due to Covid. I experienced my first bear market and noticed a lot of doom and gloom online, but I was just excited to buy stocks \u201cat a discount.\u201d Got a promotion toward the end of the year and was very happy about the work I\u2019d be doing. Raise to $73k. EOY NW: $40k\n\n2023: Was very disappointed to be starting the new year with a NW barely higher than EOY 2022 (though the bear market and those old TSLA stocks nosediving certainly played a role, I spent too much money). Took a hard look at my budget and committed to buckling down. Market turned around this year, and I hit $50k NW at 29 years old!\n\nBreakdown:\nChecking and savings: 3,400\nHYSA: 15,740\nHSA: 1,880\n401k: 5,600\nRoth IRA: 17,590\nBrokerage: 7,000 *\nTotal NW: $51,210\n\n*higher brokerage than normal for my NW because I\u2019m getting my 401k match and maxing out my Roth IRA, then saving my house downpayment here since it\u2019ll take me many years to save up a downpayment anyway \n\nFinal thoughts:\n- Paying myself first with auto saving\/investing and manually tracking expenses was so helpful. Would highly recommend to anyone starting out. \n- I\u2019m super fortunate that my boyfriend is like-minded when it comes to money. Though we have separate finances, we can work toward our goals together as we\u2019re usually happy to eat at home and enjoy inexpensive activities like hiking with the dog. If I was with someone who always wanted to go out and blow money, I wouldn\u2019t have the NW I have today. \n- This is not a linear journey. Some months, you\u2019ll have an incredible savings rate, and other months, your progress (or lack thereof) will make you want to cry. I\u2019m learning that\u2019s okay; it\u2019s just life! \n\nMany thanks to this sub for all the great info!

Pursue FI\/RE?  \nMaybe because we want to be free from work? Why? Maybe because we want more time and freedom to do what we want to do? Why? Because that might make us happy.\n1.

Why are you pursuing FI\/RE? (see point 1)\n\nIf you\u2019re like me: FI\/RE (and everything done in pursuit of FI\/RE) isn\u2019t a terminal goal. They\u2019re instrumental goals that I chose to achieve (what I think is) a fulfilling life.\n\n**The terminal goal (for me) is living a fulfilling life.** \n\n\n#Ok, so what? Why does that matter? \n\n\nFI\/RE (and savings rate, etc) is *a* path to a fulfilling life. Not *the* path for everybody, and not *the only* path.\n\nSo stuff that may decrease your savings rate and \u201cdelay your FI\/RE date,\u201d but also lead to living a fulfilling life are *just as valuable and valid* as increasing your savings rate and pursuing FI\/RE. \n\n* You highly value traveling and would be miserable not traveling? Sure, not traveling would increase your savings rate, but that would not move you closer to living your vision of a fulfilling life.\n* You highly value having kids and would be miserable not having kids? Sure, not having kids would increase your savings rate, but that would not move you closer to living your vision of a fulfilling life.\n* You highly value having a house and would be miserable renting, or you\u2019re not happy with your living condition (too cramped, too large, too high maintenance, not able to remodel)? Sure, it might have a financial impact, but it\u2019s equally valid to take steps to live a fulfilling life.\n* Pursuing FI\/RE\/budgeting\/increasing income\/living in cities\/living in LCOL areas\/getting married\/traveling\/going to restaurants\/eating lentils\/having an emergency fund in a HYSA doesn\u2019t bring you joy?   \nCool, *you know best what\u2019s best for you.*   \nBut be intentional that you\u2019re not avoiding pursuing one instrumental goal because of another instrumental goal.   \n**Keep sight of your terminal goal.**\n\nThere\u2019s a balance to be found between various instrumental goals, none are inherently better or more valid than another. What is a good instrumental goal for somebody else, might not be a good instrumental goal for you (increasing spending on fancy cheeses is likely not going to make a dairy-intolerant person happier). \n\n#Additional Reading:\n\n[Build the life you want, then save for it](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/financialindependence\/comments\/58j8pc\/build_the_life_you_want_then_save_for_it\/)\n\n[Build the life you want, then save for it [Update]](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/financialindependence\/comments\/8cqbss\/build_the_life_you_want_then_save_for_it_update\/)\n\n[Build your life - Clarification](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/financialindependence\/comments\/952pgb\/build_your_life_clarification\/)","upvote_ratio":0.75,"created_utc":1677085460.0},{"title":"Daily FI discussion thread - Wednesday, February 22, 2023","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/financialindependence\/comments\/118ucuk\/daily_fi_discussion_thread_wednesday_february_22\/","text":"Please  use this thread to have discussions which you don't feel warrant a new  post to the sub.

My marginal contribution rate was 35%+ fed taxes and 9.3%+ CA tax brackets for a 44-50%+ marginal rate. \n\nEdit: I'm not recommending to convert up to 22%. It made sense in my case as I'm permanently disabled and receiving SSDI. Most people are best with 12% conversions. \n\nI made 100% pre-tax contributions to my 401k and back-door roth contributions (too high income for T-IRA contributions.)\n\nI strongly think it's optimal for FIRE focused people to contribute 100% to pre-tax (unless in low tax bracket with higher expected tax brackets - ie Medical Doctor Residents), then try to aggressively Roth-convert as much as possible in low income years. \n\nI converted to 100% roth for all the reasons \/u\/PayDBoardMan listed, which I won't repeat here. I'll add my own unique reasons:\n\n# Roth Conversions with taxes paid from outside sources = additional Roth Contributions mathematically!\n\nMany people overlook this weird math quirk - if you pay the conversion taxes from a taxable account, it's **equivalent** to investing that money in the Roth IRA! I've greatly expanded my tax-advantaged space by performing Roth Conversions!\n\nMath:\n\n$100k converted, $18k taxes owed (my case).       \nAssumptions: Effective tax rate the same in retirement, 15% LTCG.      \n\nPay taxes out of conversion:      \n\n$82k aggressively invested over 30 years at 7% daily compounded real rates = $669k      \n\n$100k aggressively invested over 30 years at 7% daily compounded real rates = $816k Roth or Pre-tax Value.      \n\nPre-Tax After Tax Value is $816k * (1-.18) = $669k.      \n$18k tax cost invested in taxable is $146.9k. After tax value = $127.5k      \n669k + $124.68k = $796.5k.      \n\n$816k Roth Value > $796.5k pre-tax after-tax value.      \n\nTherefore:      \n\nPaying conversion taxes outside of the Roth Conversion = equivalent to investing the taxes in the Roth account!       \n\nNote - I **did not** model average 0.5% tax drag for the $18k taxable investment either! If I model that then the taxable return is 6.5% per year and it's $126k before taxes, with a $109.8k after tax value! Even if we're all 0% LTCG for this example, pre-tax would be $815.9k, and $816k >>> $778.8k pre-tax-after-tax value so you're still getting a huge \"invisible\" investment benefit by paying the taxes with outside funds!       \n\nGiven my personal finance situation it's very unlikely at retirement I'll be less than 18% effective tax rates barring huge political changes\/etc. \n\nThen if you can grow the roth even better where you'd be well 30%+ effective retirement rate were it a pre-tax account still then you've scored big by converting. \n\n#Crazy Flexibility to move to any state of my choice\n\nNow that I'm 100% Roth I can move to any state of my choice and not worry about taxes! I could decide to move back to CA if I want to, or another state with high income taxes. I can't imagine withdrawing on pre-tax anything living in California when it's only [$66k to trigger the 9.3% state tax bracket](https:\/\/www.nerdwallet.com\/article\/taxes\/california-state-tax)  \n\nBeing 100% roth with an 18% effective rate \"locked-in\" is really nice for flexibility to move around in the future. \n\n#Roth accounts encourages optimal investing - no diminishing returns\n\nAs we saw in the above example living in a state like California, and federal taxes in general, makes most people not want to push for optimizing their investing strategies. If you build your account to the point where the government is taking more than 50% combined you lose a lot of incentive to keep putting in effort for diminishing returns. There is no diminishing returns to Roth accounts! If you get really lucky and make $1 billion in a Roth account it's not going to be valued only at $500 million after taxes if it was in a pre-tax account.\n\nYou're a lot more incentivized to optimize your investing strategy with a Roth account vs a pre-tax account. \n\n#Pre-tax income interacts badly with Long-Term Capital Gains Brackets and Social Security Taxation\n\nIn my case for investing for FIRE in my career I was already making substantial taxable account investments. Under the current tax laws ordinary income pushes out the 0% long-term capital gains tax brackets. However, being 100% roth I can have 0% taxed qualified dividends to [$41k per year single, $83k married](https:\/\/www.nerdwallet.com\/article\/taxes\/capital-gains-tax-rates), and **really lower my taxes.** \n\nPull up [TurboTax Tax Caster](https:\/\/turbotax.intuit.com\/tax-tools\/calculators\/taxcaster\/) and put $40k of short-term capital gains, then compare $40k of long-term capital gains as a single person. $40k STCG is $3k in taxes. $40k LTCG is $0 in taxes.  If you have both $40k STCG and $40k LTCG - $6.8k in taxes - your pre-tax withdrawals are pushing out your LTCG advantages! \n\nIf you need $80k of LTCG and pre-tax withdrawals to live off of - you only need $73.2k of roth + LTCG instead, greatly helping you **minimize expenses** in retirement.  It's the difference between a $1.8m portfolio and a $2m portfolio @ a 4% Safe Withdrawal Rate. \n\nNow imagine ordinary income pushing Social Security income to be taxable on top of the LTCG! Ouch! You can have as high as a [55% marginal tax rate](https:\/\/www.bogleheads.org\/wiki\/Social_Security_tax_impact_calculator) with all 3 sources of income interacting together! This is known as [\"The Hump\"](https:\/\/www.bogleheads.org\/w\/images\/9\/98\/Single63K.jpg) for social security tax calculations.\n\nPer the Boglehead's wiki:   \n\n>If you can convert funds at 25% or 28% today to avoid the 46.25% or 55.5% marginal brackets in retirement your financial gains will be substantial.   \n\nI really want to revisit \/u\/PayDBoardMan's burger analogy here - by being 100% roth you just got access to an exclusive restaurant that lets you buy 40 burgers for free instead of 5 burgers for free by avoiding all these bad tax bracket interactions!  \n\n#There are plenty of ways to fill up your ordinary income tax brackets besides pre-tax withdrawals or Roth Conversions! \n\nSpeaking of STCG taxes - if you want to fill up ordinary income brackets instead - you can pursue more lucrative \"hands on\" trading or unique investment strategies that's only really available in taxable accounts! \n\nFor instance, you could:\n     \n* Sell options using margin\/portfolio margined accounts to create excess returns. You can only sell cash-secured\/spreads in retirement accounts! (You can sell future options with leverage in retirement accounts.)     \n* Invest in investments that *initially* generate K-1 losses, but later generate substantial ordinary income (real estate syndicates, etc.)    \n* Day trade with 4x intraday margin relief.    \n* Converting taxable assets into charitable remainder trusts which spit off ordinary income but saves you from realizing substantial LTCG.\n* Annuitize by buying immediate annuities with taxable assets which the interest spits off ordinary income\n* Move your bond allocation to taxable and stock allocation to your roth account so it grows the most.   \n* And many more ideas!    \n\nI've been profitably trading options for several years now. I'm really glad my retirement account is 100% roth now. I have so many options at my disposal to fill my lower ordinary-income brackets now instead of making pre-tax withdrawals.\n\n# Estate planning\n\n\/u\/PayDBoardMan already touched upon the issue of a widow getting a pre-tax account and being in single brackets. That is a huge downside of Pre-Tax accounts.\n\nHowever there are more reasons why Roth IRAs are still the superior tool for estate planning purposes (unless you have a huge charitable bone.)  The lifetime stretch is STILL possible instead of a 10 year stretch for these cases:\n\n* A surviving spouse - that's still really nice.\n* A person who is not more than 10 years younger than the IRA owner\n* A minor child of the IRA owner (until turning 18\/21\/26 based on circumstances) \n* A disabled person\n* A chronically ill person (unable to perform 2 or more ADLs or has a severe cognitive impairment) \n\nEven if it does go to a heir where they have to drain it in 10 years, it's still much nicer to inherit a Roth IRA and stretch it than deal with the heavy income taxes of a pre-tax account. What if your heir gets a lucrative job and are in really high tax brackets by year 10 stretching a pre-tax account? Ouch! \n\nThen if you do have charitable purposes - chances are it'd be well past what your spouse needs to live off of anyways, and taxable accounts are still great to donate, along with HSA accounts! So you're less likely to be donating to charity in your inheritance plan being lower net-worth. \n\n# Everyone forgets about HSA accounts\n\nThere is no Roth version of the HSA account as it's already triple-tax advantaged for qualified medical expenses. This is another pre-tax retirement income source if you haven't been saving receipts for years or if the IRS\/Congress changes the rules later on. Inheriting HSA accounts really sucks - zero stretch, all income is due in the year of death for inheritance. Ouch!\n\nWell, guess what the other nice benefit of HSA accounts are? 100% complete investment control!  Your 401k plan probably has crappy investment options. You can transfer HSA funds from your payroll HSA custodian to Fidelity at any time and then invest in leveraged ETFs. You can pursue the most risky\/speculative strategies (say Hedgefundie's Excellent Adventure) in the HSA first and with $3k~ single contribution limits per year - either have a really amazing HSA that could grow to millions or worst case $0. Hell, $3k\/year lost to HFEA is probably not going to change anyone's FI plans, and if it pays off it'd be freaking amazing to have a $1 million+ HSA account.\n\nI have a HSA account, I maxed it out every year, and despite the recent brutal drawdown, it still has a great chance of hitting $400k-$900k in 20 years being invested in HFEA. I'm still on track to hit $6m - $14m by the time I'm 65 in it with HFEA.\n\n# Lower Medicare IRMAA in Retirement too\n\nEveryone is focused on the ACA subsidies. You also get [taxed extra based on your AGI](https:\/\/www.socialsecurityintelligence.com\/the-2023-irmaa-brackets\/)  when you're on Medicare as well! $97k or less you only pay $164.90\/mo for part B. $183k+ its $527.50\/mo, a $362.60\/mo increase, or $4,351.20 a year. It's an additional 2.3% effective tax and a 5% higher marginal tax.\n\nRoth withdrawals avoids IRMAA increases. \n\n# Emergency Fund Tax Safety\n\nI really like \/u\/PayDBoardMan's example that spending isn't consistent in retirement. I don't really think the car example hit home enough with me though, I really think that $40k could be $4k a year withdrawn as a car isn't going to die suddenly in year 10, ignoring auto accidents which insurance covers. Still - it's $4k extra withdrawals you probably weren't thinking of at first at your retirement marginal tax rate! \n\nWhat does hit home with me though is emergency house repair stuff. If you're a home owner you could get hit with a ton of surprises that requires unexpected high payments - $40k for a new roof you thought you still had 10 years of life left, etc. Or maybe you got hit with a 100-year flood, weren't in a flood zone and weren't required to buy flood insurance, but it's going to be $40k of repairs regardless.\n\nEven if it's a situation that you're likely covered under insurance - it might be better to get that $40k of work started now and contractors paid and deal with the insurance adjuster later.\n\nBeing 100% roth gives me a lot of flexibility with all of this without getting hit extra hard on taxes + agi increases + health insurance (ACA\/medicare) premium increases. \n\n# Medicaid Spend Down Planning\n\nLife fucking sucks. You might be in a position where you have to go in a nursing home that's $500-$600 a day or $200k annual spend but your FI budget is only $100k, and you didn't buy long-term-care insurance to cover it. \n\nMaybe you only have a $2.5 million portfolio and those 5 years are going to suck $1m leaving $1.5m. After consulting with a well-qualified Elder law attorney the choice is made to pay the nursing home for 5 years, give away the rest of the assets after the [Medicaid Look-Back Period has passed](https:\/\/www.medicaidplanningassistance.org\/medicaid-look-back-period\/) and you preserved the remaining assets! You're now in a upscale nursing home that can't legally kick you out or legally reduce your quality of care with Medicaid footing the bill. \n\nDraining a substantial sized pre-tax account is really going to hurt badly tax wise. With a Roth account - not a dime of taxes are owed. \n\n[IRAs and Medicaid is a really thorny subject](https:\/\/www.irahelp.com\/slottreport\/can-you-lose-ira-medicaid)\n\nToo large of a pre-tax IRA = RMD income may never be qualified for Medicaid. Medicaid can attach to the RMDs. Likewise since a Roth never has RMDs all the assets are available to Medicaid. \n\nMost advice is clear though - generally, and I'm not a lawyer, but the best advice is to just spend it down per the above websites:\n\n>The simplest and safest way to do this is by transferring funds to others more than 5 years (60 months) before applying for Medicaid benefits. Such transfers escape Medicaid claims entirely.\n\nFor my comfort zone, I much rather be 100% roth if I'm ever facing having to deal with a Medicaid nursing home situation. I'm really glad I'm 100% roth :).\n\n# Pre-Tax Advantages I gave up\n\nI want to conclude this post by listing some of the advantages pre-tax accounts have that I willingly gave up and alternative ways to deal with it for my situation:\n\n**Unable to withdraw earnings tax & penalty free until 59\u00bd**   \n   \nThis is the biggest drawback for FI purposes for a Roth account is locking away your money where if you need to tap the Roth IRA it's treated as a Pre-Tax account.\n\nHow I'm dealing with it instead - \n\nIt's not as bad as people think! First of all, retirement accounts are the absolute LAST resort to touch regardless of needs. My taxable account is substantially larger than the Roth account. So any early year withdrawals will be low capital gains impact. \n\nYou first withdraw your contributions from your Roth IRA, then conversion in the order of the conversion year. Backdoor roths are ALWAYS tax and penalty free, and taxable conversions are always tax free and penalty free after 5 years. You're only taxed on earnings for pre 59 1\/2 withdrawals, [unless if they're qualified](https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/publications\/p590b#en_US_2021_publink100089543):\n     \n>1. It is made after the 5-year period beginning with the first tax year for which a contribution was made to a Roth IRA set up for your benefit.        \n\n>2. The payment or distribution is:     \n\n>a. Made on or after the date you reach age 59\u00bd,     \n>b. Made because you are disabled (defined earlier)     \n>c. Made to a beneficiary or to your estate after your death, or     \n>d. One that meets the requirements listed under First home under Exceptions in chapter 1 (up to a $10,000 lifetime limit).\n\nIf you were affected by a qualified disaster, see chapter 3. (TL;DR of qualified disasters is earnings are still taxable with no 10% early penalty but you can spread the income over 3 years which greatly reduces the tax hit.)\n\nSo yes, sadly the earnings portions of SEPP withdrawals of the Roth IRA will be taxed, so you might want to do a [Roth Conversion Ladder](https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/how-roth-conversion-ladder-works-5214808) until your desired income gets you to age 59\u00bd. \n\nThen past 59 1\/2 you'll want to convert as much to a Roth as possible, perhaps going well past the $50k example the article has, before you start taking Social Security Retirement Income. \n\n**Qualified Charitable Distributions**     \n\nPre-Tax accounts can donate up to $100k directly to one or more charities to meet their RMD requirements.    \n\nHow I'm dealing with it instead - I'll be donating appreciated shares from my taxable account. Donating appreciated shares is mathematically superior already. You can donate up to 30% of AGI of long-term holdings AND you avoid incurring LTCG by doing so. It's win-win. \n\nAlso my options trading gives a ton of STCG too! I plan to trade options until I become senile, so in my mind I can donate $100k of STCG anyways and get the identical tax benefit. I don't see the Qualified Charitable Distribution bonus to be compelling enough to keep a pre-tax account around in my situation.\n\n**Optimal Inheritance for Charities**    \n    \nNo argument, Pre-Tax accounts are optimal to donate to charities. No federal taxes are due for charitable donations of pre-tax accounts at death AND no estate taxes! \n\nHow I'm dealing with this instead - I still have my HSA pre-tax account. That is marked for charities. I'm investing it the most aggressively to optimize it. At the end of the day charities get just as huge as an impact from a taxable account donation and Roth IRA donation. I'm also doing all my giving while I'm living, which I've already shown above the taxable account is the optimal donation vehicle while alive. Yeah the step-up in basis reduces the benefits of taxable donation inheritance but it still lowers any estate taxes due. \n\nOne can establish charitable remainder trusts of various kinds with taxable accounts that turns it into ordinary income and the charity gets the remainder! Likewise you can dodge incurring capital gains by gifting appreciated shares into the remainder trusts and getting a % donation impact based on actuarial values of how much the charity is expected to get in remainder. \n\n**Foreign Nations treat Roth IRA accounts as a Pre-Tax Account**     \n   \nThis one really sucks. It's true - many foreign nations double tax Roth IRAs. \n\nHow I'm dealing with it instead - I've done some excessive digging on this and for a few nations with a really competent local tax lawyer that's both versed in USA and the foreign nation law they might be able to reach an agreement with the foreign tax authority to treat Roth accounts as taxable accounts instead. So worst case is any sales will incur capital gains instead of distribution being taxed. There is a reason why TD Ameritrade and other brokerages keeps cost basis records of Roth IRA accounts and it's for reasons exactly like this! So keep really good records, and if I plan to move to a foreign country I plan to sell and re-purchase all my investments in my Roth before establishing tax residency! \n\nI also really don't see myself moving outside of the USA or living outside of the USA. I think with Roths becoming more and more common we might have more tax treaties in the future to fix these issues too. Be sure to write your senators if you really want to live abroad! Only The President along with 2\/3rds Senators can establish and modify new treaties. \n\nThen people overlook one huge benefit of doing Roth conversions - if you renounce your USA citizenship after 59\u00bd the [Roth IRA is tax free for exit taxes.](https:\/\/www.expatriationattorneys.com\/roth-ira-expatriation-tax-exit\/) \n\nHaving a huge pre-tax account can also REALLY limits your flexibility to move abroad if people want to renounce USA citizenship to escape being taxed on your global wide income. Worst case a pre-tax account might be treated as all taxable income in the year you renounce your citizenship if the exit tax applies to you, which it does for $2m or more of net worth. My original FIRE target years ago was $2.5m net worth. \n\nOn the other hand by now being 100% Roth I have a ton of expected tax free income - greatly lowering my tax burden. I really don't see any reasons to renounce my citizenship for tax reasons and a crap ton of disadvantages if I do! I love living in the USA, I love the travel flexibility of our passport, and we have the [7th most powerful passport in the world.](https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2023\/01\/19\/most-powerful-passports-henley-passport-index.html)  If you really think about it we have [186 visa free destinations](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Henley_Passport_Index) and Japan tops the most at 193. I don't really see any reason to get a Japan passport just to visit 7 more countries without paperwork! Those countries are: Venezuela, Bolivia, Belarus, Bulgaria(Americans just pay a fee on arrival, Japanese arrive no fee), Turkey(probably not a good time to visit), and a few Asian countries that Americans just pay fees\/get e-visas\/or visa on arrivals for. The USA also gets a few visa free countries Japan doesn't get Visa free access to. \n\nIn all respects I love visiting and vacationing in tropical islands and the USA passport is actually stronger for that! We have Hawaii, Guam, Puerto Rico, the US Virgin Islands, American Samoa, and many foreign tropical islands don't require visas for US travelers but require visas on arrival for Japan. We also have visa-free and PASSPORT-FREE Palau access even though they're now a sovereign nation with proof of US Citizenship(drivers license + birth certificate), and no tourist visa required for US citizens visiting one year or less. So despite Japan being ranked as #1, for my interests I really value keeping my USA passport a lot more than switching it out for say a Japan passport. \n\nI love living in the USA. \n\n\n\n\n**Unable to rollover Roth-IRA assets to future employer 401ks\/Solo 401ks** \n\nThis is a huge drawback currently. Once in an Roth-IRA account you can never rollover it into a solo Roth-401k again or an employer Roth 401k plan.\n\nIf the SECURE 2.0 act becomes law this issue is fixed. \n\n**Roth Future Tax Risks**\n\nLook - I can make the same arguments against pre-tax accounts. At one time we had a 70% upper federal tax bracket too. Boy that would hurt if you had to spend down assets for Medicaid at the time being. Pre-tax accounts also get hurt just as bad for sales taxes\/VAT\/so on if our government is greedy and DOESN'T reduce income taxes. Look at the EU\/UK - its high income tax AND high VAT taxes! \n\nWe can't predict the future. If you're worried about the tax future then 50% roth and 50% pre-tax is the only logical choice. \n\nHowever being FIRE focused, we are significantly living below our means. I'm living in a small home where property taxes is $4,000 a year and capped at 3% annual increases, AND property tax is computed on the home's replacement cost and not the market value of the home! My total housing payment WITH mortgage is $24k year, and FI for that is $600k which I'm already house-FI and lean-FI. In a worst case scenario I either pay off mortgage and live off $4k year + food costs, or relax with over 25 years of runway of cutting all other discretionary spending to the bone. I'm living by myself, I have 3 unused bedrooms and can get roommates at $500\/mo\/room. $24k spend just became $6k spend + food costs so lean-FI on $150k or less. Health insurance easily Medicaid or ACA subsidies, especially with being 100% roth. Paid off mortgage with 3 roommates = +$14,000 rental income each year. **I'm now FI just simply by owning a paid off home!** \n\nSeeking FIRE means you're adaptable and have a plan. We have tons of flexibility and privileges by being well off financially and being very financially and mathematically literate. We can handle any future tax issues that get thrown to Roth IRAs just fine. \n\nI feel really relieved having converted 100% of my pre-tax accounts to roth accounts. Look - if future proposed tax legislation bothers you - WRITE your senators. I wrote my senators about the above Roth IRA drawback of rolling over assets to future employer 401k Roth plans + Roth 401k RMD issues, and they were shocked as they were NOT AWARE of that drawbacks! They got it in the SECURE 2.0 act and will not forget this if it doesn't become law this year. I will not forget this issue either! \n\nI'm not afraid to give feedback about anything! I politely write people and things change - even my broker TD Ameritrade changes the % margin they take on various securities on Portfolio Margin as I ask them to review stuff as the percentage they're taking for margin isn't reflective of the actual risk! People are in the dark unless you appropriately communicate! :) \n\n**Roth 401ks are subject to RMDs**    \n   \nJust rollover it to a Roth IRA account. It was fixed in the secure 2.0 act should it become law where Roth 401ks will NOT be subject to RMDs.  \n\nAgain, I wrote my senators about this too! They could have made Roth IRAs subject to RMDs instead but they chose to align 401k plans instead, it's also a great sign that they really do care about preserving the tax benefits of Roth at this time! It's unlikely tax policy will drastically change in the next 10-20 years. That's why I don't feel stressed out about future taxes being 100% roth. \n\n**Fine grained taxable income control**    \n    \nOn 12\/31 every year you can know exactly to the penny your tax bracket is and make withdrawals from pre-tax accounts to optimize your tax brackets to the penny.   \n\nHow I'm dealing with it instead - Personally, I'm really freaking happy that I stayed in the 22% bracket and had an 18% effective tax rate doing my conversions. I'm personally happy to spend 12\/31 with family instead of spreadsheets trying to squeeze every last penny of tax efficiency with \"perfect\" withdrawals\/conversions! By finishing my Roth conversions I don't have to analyze it anymore **for the rest of my life.**  I can't express enough how amazing it feels to have Roth converted everything! It's freed up so much analyzing for me and I'm just really happy living life instead! \n\n#TL;DR\n\n**I have zero regrets converting 100% of my pre-tax accounts to Roth accounts!**","upvote_ratio":0.82,"created_utc":1676925291.0},{"title":"How do you evaluate nonprofits?","author":"one_rainy_wish","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/financialindependence\/comments\/117r2yo\/how_do_you_evaluate_nonprofits\/","text":"Whether it is donating money or time, folks who FIRE are in a good position to be of particular help to charitable organizations if they choose.\n\nFor folks who choose to use either their time or money to help nonprofits\/charities, how did you find reputable ones and what made you choose the one(s) you engage with specifically?

I am trying to have a discussion regarding building a life you want after FIRE vs accepting the life you have.\n\nThis post ended up being super long so I am going to post a TLDR here:\n\n \nDoes anyone else deal with this fear that retiring young will create financial hardship in the future? How do you cope with it? How do you get over it? \n\nI feel this would be a common fear, as those of us who are planners and got here through hard work, did it by anticipating the worst that could happen and when that doesn\u2019t happen we succeed. Now that we have succeeded the worst that can happen is losing it which stifles enjoyment of what we have built up. \n\n\n\nI\u2019m a 45 year old single male. Blue collar worker who got really lucky. 15 years ago I had a headstart on the \u201cmodern day\u201d gold rush (internet) pretty much, when a guy on reddit years ago showed me how to sell the shovels he was forging to people who had dreams of panning for gold. I was pretty much the guy digging the trenches for internet cables in towns. Since then I have managed to really build myself a nest egg and at 45 I am retired. \n\nThis success came after 20 years of failure. I failed 5 businesses. I was sued by credit card companies for $50,000. I lost investments in stocks. I lost investments in real estate. I almost filed for bankruptcy at one point. My current success had zero backing and it wasn\u2019t overnight success either. I worked a second job for 5 years to pay for it all while I was trying to start up, and sold \u201cshovels\u201d after work everyday from the time I got off till it was pitch black outside. Once I had enough to quit my job day job and focus full-time on the \u201cshovels\u201d I worked every single day and all hours. \n\nWhat I am trying to get at, is things have not been easy and I am tired of grinding. I worked long  hours and broke my body, my mind, and my relationships in the process. My only drive was that I knew this day would come.\n\nAnd now I am here and I don\u2019t have to worry about anything.  \n\nI\u2019ve managed to create myself a nice fortune for a single man. My main focus as I grew was diversifying my holdings, so I am not exposed in any one specific area.\n\n* 1 million in retirement funds (IRA, 401k, HSA, a taxable retirement based stock account, gold, silver, crypto)\n\n\n*  \u00bd million in fun money funds (cash, stocks). I don\u2019t spend this money but attempt to be a lot more aggressive with my trading\/gambling. I use to gamble a lot with stocks but now find buying and holding has treated me way better. The main lesson I learned is that even in stock trading, the house always wins.\n\n* $100,000 in living funds\/ER funds.\n\n* I own all my vehicles. A Gas guzzler for adventures. A gas saver for my daily. A hot rod to keep my garage warm. I just bought an RV trailer cash to try and spend more time away from home. \n\n* I own 2 commercial buildings, both are being leased at great rates. My diamond in the rough and the one I am most proud of, I paid $500,000 for about 8 years ago when I realized my business needed room to grow in. I refinanced it last year, paying it down to $250k with a 3% rate. Maybe a bad move paying it down with such a great rate but I really really hate debt and believe that is what got me to where I am\u2026. But more on that later. The building is now worth $1.2 million. My tenants will pay off the building in 5 years if I put all of the rental income towards it, but at such a great rate I think that might not be a smart choice. If I only pay the bills and pocket the rest I am looking at $100,000 annually.\n\n* My second commercial building isn\u2019t worth much, I purchased it all cash about 4 years ago for almost nothing and rent it out to a local company who has long term staying power. It will pay itself off this year. I think the tenants are worth more than the building to be honest so I am not gonna bother listing the price on it. The thing about it is that I LOVE the area. I really want to tear the building down and build a \u201cdream project\u201d of a commercial building with a couple floors and a living space at the very top which I can use as a vacation home. If I leave it as is I am making $12,000 a year on it. If I fix it up I will still only make $12,000 a year on it.\n\n* I bought my first house when I was in my 20s. One of my \u201cfailed\u201d businesses was to be a homebuilder and this was my first spec house. I completely failed at the business but managed to secure my first home. I own this house out right and have been renting it out well below market rate to a family friend. I have no desire to charge more rent because him and his wife take care of it and I don\u2019t even have to think about it or worry about it. They pay enough to cover the expenses and what my mortgage would of been had I secured a 30 year instead of 15 year. So I am not losing money but not really making money either. I am bringing in $12,000 a year on this one.\n\n* I bought my second house, and now my primary house at the top of the market last year, but got an amazing rate at 2.65 percent. It\u2019s an ok house, in an ok area, and cost me $500,000. I am currently fixing it up, which surprisingly brings me a lot of peace, so I don\u2019t regret the purchase. The struggle at the time was that I honestly could have afforded a million dollar house but I couldn\u2019t bring myself to spend it. I settled for far less, which helps me sleep well at night. At least I did sleep well. \n\n* I am still paid an \u201cowners dividend\u201d from my company that I founded at $3000 a month, but that will end in 5 years.  \n\nNow that I have explained where I am financially, let me explain my issue.\n\nI\u2019m kind of miserable. I don\u2019t want kids, and have no desire to have kids, so there\u2019s no one to worry about passing this fortune onto. Even then I can\u2019t bring myself to spend it. I do have someone I am sharing my life with, but it has been a struggle.\n\nMy enjoyment in life comes from traveling and being in new places. I loved where I am when I moved here, but it\u2019s been three years now and I have lost my enjoyment of it. It\u2019s a great location in terms of city life, and proximity to hospitals and airports. I grew up on a homestead. Not so much a farm but very close to the idea of one. I\u2019ve always dreamed of living on an actual farm and expanding on the life I was raised in. \n\nProblem is that I can\u2019t bring myself to spend the money to create this life. I\u2019m afraid that this nest egg I have spent years building is going to be gone. Sure, the farm life is nice when you are young and can do lunges all day long without consequences, but I am feeling the pains of age coming on and the wear and tear I put my body through when I was younger is slowly starting to show itself. I might not be as comfortable plowing field when I am 65.\n\nThat is not the biggest issue though. The biggest issue is that I am terrified of losing my wealth and being forced to go back to grinding again. Everyday we read stories about 70 year olds going back to work because they can\u2019t afford their bills. We see them at Walmart or other stores. My local grocery store no longer has high school kids picking up the shopping carts. Instead it is now guys older than me collecting them. I see this happening and it terrifies me. \n\nLet me be clear, I\u2019m not special enough to die young. Maybe I\u2019ll have the courage to put a bullet in my head once I am too frail, but until then I am pretty sure I am gonna suffer to a long age. \n\nEven if I make the leap into buying the farm, I can\u2019t bring myself to look at what I can seriously afford because of this fear. I am still bargain bin hunting for properties. Covid has completely eliminated bargain bins. Realistically with my wealth, I could buy a great farm with a house, and fields and plenty of acreage but I am looking at spending close to a million on that. Instead I keep looking at bare land. Even when looking at bare land, instead of considering the 100 acre properties with a stream and gorgeous fields for $300,000- $500,000 I am looking at the 20 acre plot for $100,000 because you can buy a really nice house in the 300k-500k range.\n\nIs this common? How do you deal with it? Have any of you taken the leap and spent a large portion of your wealth on something? If so how do you feel about it now?","upvote_ratio":0.52,"created_utc":1676987524.0},{"title":"Daily FI discussion thread - Monday, February 20, 2023","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/financialindependence\/comments\/1172yw6\/daily_fi_discussion_thread_monday_february_20_2023\/","text":"Please  use this thread to have discussions which you don't feel warrant a new  post to the sub.

See here for examples: [https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/personalfinance\/comments\/10qwnrx\/why\\_you\\_should\\_almost\\_never\\_contribute\\_to\\_a\\_roth\/](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/personalfinance\/comments\/10qwnrx\/why_you_should_almost_never_contribute_to_a_roth\/) But there aren't many that outline the mathematical benefits of Roth accounts. To be clear, I am not here to argue that contributing to Roth accounts is always better than contributing to Traditional (Pre-Tax). This is mostly aimed at the vocal minority that believe almost nobody should be contributing to Roth even if taxes were to go up in retirement. In general, I believe you want enough Pre-Tax to fill in the lower tax brackets in retirement and enough Roth to keep you out of the top tax brackets. With that being said, let\u2019s get into some of the reasons why Roth accounts are better than some would have you believe. There is an example at the end that shows how some of these Roth advantages could work in practice.\n\n**Comparing marginal tax rates to effective is flawed.**\n\nLet\u2019s say you need to buy 10 burgers. The Roth Restaurant sells burgers for $12 each. The Traditional Restaurant gives you the first 5 burgers free, then charges $15 each for the next 5 burgers. There\u2019s a bunch of people out there going \u201cThe Roth Restaurant sucks! Just buy all your burgers from Traditional! You\u2019ll get 10 burgers for only $75 instead of $120. Why would you ever buy a $12 burger when you get them for an effective cost of $7.50 each! Traditional could charge $20 per burger and it would still be a better deal!\u201d But in reality, it\u2019s not an either\/or decision. The optimal strategy would be to get your first 5 burgers from Traditional and then get your last 5 from Roth for a total cost of $60. The effective total cost of the burgers aren\u2019t as important as the marginal cost of each individual burger. You can still save money by buying $12 burgers even if the effective cost of buying all Traditional burgers was only $7.50. Obviously, you want to have enough Traditional to take advantage of the lower tax brackets, but that doesn\u2019t mean Roth sucks unless your effective rate in retirement is higher.\n\nThis seems obvious to me, but there\u2019s a significant number of articles out there that argue that Traditional is better even if taxes rise, and that\u2019s just simply not true if the marginal cost of what you\u2019re putting into a Roth is lower than the marginal cost of where you would be taking it out in retirement. For example, in this Wantfi article [https:\/\/wantfi.com\/skip-the-roth-ira-and-401k-pay-less-tax.html](https:\/\/wantfi.com\/skip-the-roth-ira-and-401k-pay-less-tax.html) they show that if taxes increase by 75%, then a 100% Traditional account would still beat a 100% Roth account as you\u2019d be paying an effective rate of 11.72% vs 12% with Roth. This is true. But an account with 39% Traditional and 61% Roth would give you an effective tax rate of 7.32%. Paying 12% in Roth saved you from the 18 & 21% marginal brackets in retirement and having 39% in Traditional let you take advantage of the 0% bracket.\n\n**Lower MAGI in retirement**\n\nThe ability to lower your taxable income level in retirement by utilizing Roth accounts is a potentially massive benefit that not enough people talk about. Traditional contributions allow you to lower your income today, but only so much. If you\u2019re contributing 20% to retirement, the most that you can lower your income is, 20%. But in retirement, you have much more control over your adjusted gross income. This becomes a massive deal when it comes to things healthcare or other benefits. I won\u2019t get into ACA specifics here as it can get complicated and the rules will likely change long before I retire, but there\u2019s a possibility that the savings from having a lower MAGI can far outweigh the additional tax burden of Roth. Let\u2019s say you paid 22% on your Roth funds and in retirement you\u2019re in the 15% marginal bracket for $40,000 of income. That 7% difference cost you $2,800 per year in taxes. But having $40,000 less in taxable income could save you $10,000 per year in healthcare premiums, deductibles, and OOP expenses. It could qualify you for SNAP benefits which save you another $4000 per year depending on what the means testing rules are at the time. There are many scenarios in which Roth accounts lose when just comparing total tax costs, but the Roth saver still wins by virtue of having a much lower MAGI in retirement. Trying to squeeze out every drop of tax savings with Traditional could end up being penny wise and pound foolish.\n\n**It's entirely possible for the lowest tax bracket to be more than 12%**\n\nMost people expect to have the same or lower income in retirement. Many people then conclude that their marginal tax bracket will be the same or lower. But that\u2019s far from a guarantee. Currently the lowest tax bracket in the US is 10% after the standard deduction with 12% being the next level higher. As recently as 2001, the bottom tax bracket paid 15% and the bottom bracket was 20% back in 1963. If you\u2019re in the 12% tax bracket today, you could have a lower income in retirement and still be paying a higher marginal tax rate. If you ensure that you have enough Traditional to fill the standard deduction, then paying 12% today could save you from having to pay 15-20% in retirement.\n\n**The standard deduction isn\u2019t guaranteed to remain this large.**\n\nThe standard deduction in 2023 for a married couple is $27,700. The standard deduction for a married couple in 2017 was $12,700 (roughly $15,500 in 2023 dollars). If the standard deduction returns to where it had been historically, then the \u201c0%\u201d bracket gets significantly smaller. You typically have far few deductions to make itemizing feasible in retirement, so this means a larger portion of your income could fall into the higher tax brackets, even if your retirement income is lower than your current income. A couple making $115k under today\u2019s tax bracket is paying a 12% marginal rate, but under the 2017 tax brackets (adjusted for inflation), they would be in the 25% bracket. If taxes were to start to look more similar to 6 years ago there are some people who may regret not loading up on Roth when it was cheaper.\n\n**Social Security**\n\nSocial Security taxation is somewhat complex and may change by the time you retire, so I won\u2019t go too deep into them here. But currently the rate at which you are taxed on Social Security depends on your taxable income. Someone who loaded up on Roth could end up paying no taxes on their Social Security while someone who only has Traditional may end up paying taxes on 85% or more. We\u2019ll get into how much this could save in the example at the end.\n\n**Spousal Death**\n\nIt\u2019s not something that people like to think about, but the fact is that if you remain married through retirement, one of you will likely outlive the other. There are some laws in place that make it easier for widows to transition, but eventually this may essentially double your tax rate. Let\u2019s take a married couple who earned $160k per year during their working years and in retirement they can comfortably live on $120k per year (2023 dollars). We\u2019ll assume tax brackets remain the same, but the TCJA tax break expires in 2026 as expected. The couple is solidly in the 22% marginal bracket during their working years, but only the 15% marginal bracket in retirement, so having all Traditional makes sense...atleast originally. One day the wife dies, but the husband wants to keep the total spending the same since he can\u2019t take it with him when he dies. His marginal tax rates are now 0% up to $13,850; 10% up to $24,850; 15% up to $58,575; 25% up to $109,225; and 28% on the rest. More than half of his income is now being taxed at 25% or higher. Even in this scenario, a 100% Traditional saver would beat a 100% Roth saver, but someone who saved mostly Traditional funds with a bit of Roth mixed in at 22% would come out even better than a 100% Traditional saver as it would help keep them out of the high tax brackets in retirement.\n\n**State taxes**\n\nIn general, factoring state taxes into the equation benefits Traditional savers over Roth. Many people live in high income tax states then move to lower income tax states in retirement. The flip side is not nearly as common, but it does apply to some people, so it\u2019s worth atleast mentioning. For example, I work in Texas, but plan on moving away in retirement. Texas has ungodly property taxes, which makes the prospect of retiring here unappealing. If I retire in Texas with a $300,000 house and $60,000 in taxable income, I\u2019d pay around $6,000 per year in property taxes and $0 in state income tax. If I move back home to Louisiana, I\u2019d pay around $2000 a year in property taxes and around $2,000 in state income tax. My overall tax bill would be lower even though I\u2019m moving to a state with higher state income taxes. Louisiana has a \\\\\\~3.5% marginal state income tax, so by prepaying the tax while I\u2019m in Texas, I can save myself that tax in retirement, and cut down on that $2,000.\n\n**Avoid Required Minimum Distributions**\n\nRoth IRAs and Roth 401ks don\u2019t have RMDs. These are well covered, so I won\u2019t bother, but not having enough Roth assets in retirement could limit how much control you have over your withdrawal rate later in retirement. Many people who use conservative estimates and don\u2019t include Social Security in the retirement calculations may end up with a much larger nest egg than they anticipated. Certainly a good problem to have, but if it\u2019s all Traditional, the RMDs and Social Security payments could push you into a much higher marginal bracket than you anticipated. This may not impact your ability to retire comfortably but it can have a significant impact on the inheritance that you leave.\n\n**Spending isn\u2019t consistent in retirement**\n\nTo keep life simple and stress free, many people choose not to carry debt in retirement. This means that often times large purchases are covered in cash instead paying over time with a loan. So if your safe withdrawal rate is $70k in retirement, but you budget $40k for a new car every 10 years, you may end up spending around $66k for 9 years and then $106k in a single year. If you don\u2019t have enough Roth funds, you could push yourself into a high tax bracket. Now, instead of withdrawing $40k for the car, you\u2019d have to withdraw over $53,000 just to cover the 25% tax bill. Yes, you could plan and budget and save a little every year for these purchases. Or you could just have enough Roth funds to cover these large purchases so that you aren't \"saving up\" for a $40k car when you have a $2 million nest egg.\n\n**There are several ways to fill the lower tax brackets in retirement**\n\nAutomatic 401k enrollments are almost always put in pre-tax. Many people may already have traditional funds from before they became financially literate and even knew Roth was an option. Employer matches and discretionary contributions are always (before this year atleast) pre-tax. Secure Act 2.0 allows for employer matches to be Roth, but that doesn\u2019t impact previous matches and it will likely be years before most employers begin to implement that. For some people, the employer match alone may be enough to fill in the 0% bracket in retirement. Social Security or part time work in retirement can also help fill in those low tax brackets for many depending on what the tax laws are at the time (I think it\u2019s likely that 100% of Social Security will be taxable for all incomes by the time I reach that age). And most people reach their peak earning years later in their career, so I would rather get older and realize I need more pre-tax funds than realize too late that I need more Roth when my marginal tax rate is highest. For example, my wife and I have $60k in pre-tax savings just from employer matches and our early 401k contributions before we did the math on Roth. I get a 5% match and 2% discretionary contribution. She gets a 4% match and 3% contribution. This means we get 7% in our pre-tax every year from our employers. A 7% match on our $140k combined salary is $9800 per year. In 23 years the original $60k along with the employer match funds will be worth around $760k with an inflation adjusted return of 6.5%. With a withdrawal rate of 3.5%, we can expect about $26,600 in taxable income in retirement without having to put another dime of our own money in Traditional accounts. This is almost enough to fill up the current 0% tax bracket of $27,700. There\u2019s a chance that we have already bought all the free burgers we can. Our marginal bracket will likely be 25% or higher for the majority of the rest of our careers, so we will have even more traditional funds then. It makes more sense to load up on Roth now while it's cheaper. The 12% that we\u2019re paying now won\u2019t be coming from the bottom in retirement, it\u2019ll be from the top.\n\n**The \u201drisk\u201d factor with Roth can be lower\\***\n\nEspecially for those who are in the 12% bracket. If you pre-pay taxes at 12% and then realize in retirement that you could\u2019ve been paying 6% instead, that\u2019s not ideal, but it isn\u2019t likely to devastate your retirement. If you pass on 12% today only for the US to adopt a tax structure similar to some European counties and you end up paying 40% in retirement, that can be devastating. If you\u2019re 100% Traditional and realize that you should've had more Roth to avoid high taxes, that could severely impact your safe withdrawal rate. If you\u2019re mostly Roth and realize that you should've had more Traditional to fill in lower brackets, you can do Roth conversions to fill up the lower brackets. If you run out of traditional, it\u2019s not ideal because you didn\u2019t optimize correctly, but it doesn\u2019t impact your safe withdrawal rate. You also get the benefits that come along with having very low taxable income, which can offset some of the loss of not being optimized.\n\nSome people argue that Traditional offers you the ability to do Roth conversions later, which is true, and is a great reason to have some tax diversity. But keep in mind, you still need money to live off. To start the Roth conversion ladder, you need to make your first conversion 5 years before you need the money. If you do this at the end of your working career, that money is taxed at your marginal bracket, during what is likely the highest earning years of your life. This would be the worst time to do a conversion. So most people start after they retire, but you still need to money to live off for those 5 years. For some, this is where taxable investments come in, which is a great idea as you can pay no capital gains taxes if your income is low enough. However, the other option is to roll your Roth 401k into your existing Roth IRA and immediately have access to all of the contributions (if the IRA has been open for atleast 5 years). The laws on long term capital gains can change at any time and the idea of a higher capital gains tax may sound appealing to the everyday voter. I don\u2019t trust that long term capital gains will still be 0% when it\u2019s time for me to retire, so I prefer to use my Roth contributions to bridge the 5 year gap while I\u2019m converting some of my traditional funds. There\u2019s also a limit on how much can be converted before it stops making sense. If I pass on 12% Roth today in order to convert later and the 12% bracket becomes a 15% bracket again, we can only convert around $50,000 each year before we hit the 15% bracket, which is lower than what we would like to live on.\n\n\\*The reason I say the risk CAN be lower and not the risk IS lower is because Roth does have a massive risk which is the possibility of the law changing and these accounts becoming taxable or included as taxable income in the future. I don\u2019t find it likely that the US would essentially rug pull every Roth saver, but I've seen worse, so it\u2019s worth mentioning.\n\n**Early Career**\n\nFor some reason people act like Doctors are the only ones who have salary increases in their career, but it\u2019s not unusual for someone to go from making around $50k early in their career, $75k in the middle, and $100k at the end. When someone making $100k retires, they are more likely to want to keep a similar lifestyle to their later career, not earlier. Going from $100k in income to $70k spending in retirement is not unreasonable. Loading up on Roth early in your career while your marginal bracket is likely at it\u2019s lowest makes perfect sense. You\u2019ll have plenty of time to fill in the traditional later on.\n\n**\"Worst Case\" Example**\n\nJust to be clear, contributing 100% to Roth throughout your entire career is almost never a good idea, but I wanted to give an example of how Roth can help protect the average person in retirement in a \u201cworst case scenario\u201d. A couple makes $100,000 combined ($50,000 each) and save 15% of their income from ages 30-60 along with a 5% Pre-Tax employer match, earning 6% per year (all figures are inflation adjusted 2023 dollars). Couple A contributes 100% to Traditional. Couple B contributes 100% to Roth. They spend their working years under the equivalent of the 2023 tax law, but after retiring the tax laws revert to back to the year 2000 levels: 0% on first $13,000; 15% from 13,000 to $90,000; and 28% on income above $90,000). Couple A has $1,600,000 in Pre-Tax savings and $0 in Roth. They can withdraw $64,000 per year using the 4% rule. They pay 0% on the first $13,000 and then 15% on the remaining $51,000, for a total tax bill of $7,650. This leaves them with $56,350 to spend. Couple B could only save $13,200 per year instead of $15,000 since they had to pay the 12% marginal tax. In retirement they have $400,000 in pre-tax from the employer match and $1,056,000 in Roth. Using the 4% rule they can withdraw $16,000 from their pre-tax and $42,240 from their Roth for a total of $58,240. The first $13,000 is at 0% so they only need to pay 15% on $3,000, leaving them with a total tax bill of $450. This leaves them with $57,790 to spend, which is slightly more than the $56,350 that Couple A has.\n\nThe slight difference in spending power isn\u2019t too significant though (and they would be exactly the same if the lowest bracket remained 12%, $57,880). Roth only shines when you start to consider the other benefits. In Uncle Sam\u2019s eyes, Couple A has an income of $64,000 while Couple B has an income of $16,000. We don\u2019t know what the healthcare laws will be, but we\u2019ll assume a structure similar to the ACA today. Couple B increases their pre-tax withdrawal to just enough to meet the FPL requirements and pays $0 in healthcare premiums and has a $0 deductible, giving them a total healthcare expense of $0 for the year. Couple A has to pay $350 per month in premiums and has a $15,000 deductible, of which they spend half, for a total healthcare cost of $11,700 (Being 60 can be expensive. Invest in your HSAs folks). Couple B also gets $300 per month in SNAP benefits (food stamps), for a total of $3600. This means Couple B saved $15,300 in NON TAX related expenses just by having Roth funds. Even if the Roth saver lost the tax battle (which they didn\u2019t) they would still be the winner overall. This savings means Couple B can either spend money on more optional purchases, or reduce their spending to $42,490, which is a withdrawal rate of 2.9% to give them more security.\n\nSocial Security income largely depends on when the couple decides to begin receiving them, but $40,000 combined is not unreasonable if they delay distributions. We don\u2019t know what Social Security tax rules will be by then, but we\u2019ll assume a similar law to today. Couple A will have to pay taxes on 85% of that $40k while Couple B can reduce their Pre-Tax withdrawal back down just enough in order to pay 0%. This puts Couple A\u2019s taxable income at $104,000, so 85% of $14,000 will be taxed at 28%. And 85% of $26,000 will be taxed at 15% for a total social security tax of $6,647. Couple B pays $0. Total spendable income is now $89,703 for Couple A and $97,790 for Couple B. It's unlikely that either would increase their spending this much, but the 28% bracket would come into play for Couple A in large purchase years. Keep in mind those numbers are just from the tax savings, not from the additional Roth benefits.\n\nMore years go by, one of the spouses has passed away, and taxes are now at levels that mirror similar developed countries: 0% on the first $16,000, 20% up to $40,000, and 40% above $40,000 for individuals. Both Widow A and Widow B are now spending around $60,000 per year and still have extra money to give. They decide to pay for their granddaughter Lorelai\u2019s $40,000 per year tuition to Yale in exchange for weekly Friday night dinners with her and her mother, also named Lorelai. Social Security is now 100% taxable due to the debt crisis. Widow B still has plenty of Roth funds due to their 2.9% withdrawal rate early on, so they only need to pay taxes on the $40,000 from Social Security which totals $4800, leaving them with $95,200 to spend ($55,200 after paying for Yale). Widow A has no Roth so they need to pay the $4800 on the Social Security and $24,000 on the remaining $60,000 withdrawal. This would only leave them with $71,200 after taxes (only $31,200 after paying for Yale). In order to have the same spending amount as Widow B, they would need to withdraw $100,000 from their retirement instead of $60,000.\n\nBy this point, Widow B would be far ahead of Widow A, but let\u2019s balance the scales anyway and assume that by 85 they have both managed their money well and have the same amount that they started with. With $1.6 million in Traditional funds, Widow A had to take minimum distributions of $100,000 per year on top of the $40,000 for Social Security, leaving them with a withdrawal rate of 6.25% and a yearly tax bill of $44,800. The extra money from the forced withdrawals will need to go into savings or a taxable brokerage, which may be subject to increasing estate taxes when they pass. Widow B has $400,000 in Traditional funds leaving them with a minimum distribution of $25,000 plus $40,000 for Social Security and a total tax bill of $14,800. A full $30,000 less than Widow A. At 85, they aren\u2019t getting out much, so having $50,200 per year is more than enough for them, meaning they can leave the $1.056 million in Roth alone to grow tax free. This also puts their withdrawal rate at 1.72%. When they finally kick the bucket, Widow B will have a larger inheritance to leave behind, with most of it being tax-free.\n\n**Psychological benefit**\n\nWhen we do the math on Trad vs Roth, we always make sure the Traditional saver is putting away more money to compensate for the tax treatment differences, which is the fair and correct way to do the comparison. However, ask the average person how much they\u2019re saving in their 401k and most of them will tell you a percentage, not a number. Most people here understand that if they were saving 15% a year in Roth and then they switch to Traditional, they need to increase the percentage to keep up. But many people aren\u2019t debating if they should put 15% in Roth or 19% in Traditional. They\u2019re debating 15% vs 15%. On paper, it\u2019s certainly not a fair comparison (which is why I did it the fair way above), but using Roth can trick some people into saving more for retirement as they\u2019ll never see the money. I know many people who intentionally have additional taxes taken out each month so that they get a bigger refund in tax season to use for a vacation or other large expense. Yes, it's an interest-free loan to the government, but it\u2019s easier to get a $5,000 tax refund than it is to save $200 per paycheck for a vacation that\u2019s a year away. If you\u2019re advising someone who you know has a \u201csee money, spend money\u201d mindset, convincing them to go with Roth may trick them into saving more money that they would with Traditional, even if it\u2019s not the optimal choice for their income level. Even for people who understand the difference, dedicating a larger percentage of your income for traditional isn\u2019t easy. For example, our combined income in 2022 was around $115k, which put us in the 12% bracket after HSA contributions. We maxed out our Roth IRAs, I maxed out my Roth 401k, and my wife put 15% of her salary in her Roth 401k. Due to a pay raise and my wife getting a new job, our income this year will be around $140k. I switched about $20k of my 401k contribution to Traditional to keep us out of the 22% bracket, which will save us about $4400 in taxes. To keep the same overall savings rate, my wife would need to increase her contributions from 15% to about 22.5%, which she shut down. She understands that our overall savings rate would be the same, but the psychological hurdle of increasing the percentage when we\u2019re already saving so much of our income was too much. So instead, that additional $170 per paycheck will likely just go into a HYSA, some home improvement items, or other lifestyle creep.\n\nAgain, just to be reiterate, I am NOT saying that Roth is better than Traditional. There are some scenarios in which a 100% Traditional accounts makes sense. There are almost no scenarios in which a 100% Roth account makes sense. At some point in your earning career, you will absolutely want some (possibly the majority) of your savings to be Pre-Tax. I did not cover those here, because that\u2019s not what the post is about. This is just here to show that Roth does not suck and there are many scenarios where it can save you a significant amount of money over Traditional. Not everything in my \u201cworst case scenario\u201d will happen, but some of them likely will, and having Roth exposure can help provide security, peace of mind, and flexibility. Some people may wonder why I mentioned the 12% bracket so often in this post. An individual who makes $58,575 or a married couple who makes $117,150 or less will be in the 12% marginal bracket or lower. Median income statistics vary, but all of them indicate that it is less than those numbers, meaning most Americans are in the 12% bracket or lower. I believe my example is relevant to a lot more people than something like the Go Curry Cracker example which features a couple making $54k a year and living off $17.5k.","upvote_ratio":0.94,"created_utc":1676821175.0},{"title":"An early plan to FIRE","author":"engineerdude2019","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/financialindependence\/comments\/116w6bh\/an_early_plan_to_fire\/","text":"TLDR; I'm a year out of grad school and knew I wanted to FIRE, but didn't know if I was on track. I made a tool to plan my investment goals and forecast my own early retirement. I'm using this mostly to set my near term (3-5 year) investment goals, while keeping an eye on the horizon for that sweet early retirement dream.\n\nI've been doing a bunch of math on my current financial situation and laying out my path to reach FIRE. I did the math and the writeup mostly to convince myself I was on track, but would like to get feedback on my current plan. Is it reasonable? What am I missing?\n\nHere's my situation:\n\n* 28 year old aerospace engineer with a masters degree, currently earning $95000 in a HCOL city\n* \\~$70k of student debt at 3.5% interest I pay $550 a month on\n* \\~$22k on a car loan at 3.8% that I pay $400 a month on.\n* Last year I managed to put away about \\~$23k for retirement with little to no plan (6k in Roth IRA, $14k in 401k, $1k in HSA, $1k other - crypto).\n\nNow that I have a better idea of my budget and what I can reasonably save off my current income, I've been doing a bunch of math forecasting when I can retire. A note on my approach is I'd like to pursue FIRE, while still enjoying some luxuries in life. For example, I don't regret purchasing a new car last year for the reduced stress about my car will break downing. I travel and will continue to. Outside of those two things, I'm trying to reduce expenses wherever possible.\n\n**Assumptions:**\n\nI'm assuming a FIRE income of $125,000. This is a bit of a guess since I don't know exactly what my lifestyle will cost 15 years from now, but my whole analysis is to get something to plan my savings goals for the next 3-5 years. I expect I'll dial this number in much closer down the road.\n\nI'm assuming an average market performance of 10%, I'm mostly invested in basic S&P 500 ETFs and will continue that. I'm going to aggressively pursue my first $100k. I'm dedicated currently to maximizing my savings, once the snowball builds, I'd like to let off the gas a bit. All of my raises until I hit that $100k goal will just increase my savings potential. I know I'm in for a decent promotion this year, I'm assuming an 8.5% raise (will know in the next few weeks! part of what's spurring the planning). Beyond that, I assume a 3% annual raise each year. Once my income no longer qualifies for Roth IRA, I will transition contributions to a non-tax advantaged brokerage account.\n\nThis year I've already upped my HSA savings to max it out to protect for unexpected medical emergency, though I am trying to pay for all medical expenses out of pocket and re-invest the disbursements. I'm also assuming a 4% 401k match (what I receive at my current job).\n\nLastly, I'm assuming no major lifestyle changes (marriage, kids, house). It's hard to forecast those accurately, so I didn't bother to try.\n\n**Knowns:**\n\nI will pay off my car at 33 and my student loans at 43. Once those happen, I will increase my monthly brokerage contributions. I am not writing off that I'll never buy another new car or other luxuries, but I will not permit myself to cut my monthly contributions to afford one. After I hit my first $100k, I'll start to allow myself to take some raises that would afford these luxuries.\n\n**Contributions Summary:**\n\nA graphical look at my contributions broken down. For most of my 30s, my contributions will be max 401k ($1625 monthly), max Roth IRA ($541 monthly), max HSA ($291 monthly) and $650 monthly brokerage (total of \\~$3500 monthly with employer match). In my 40s, I pay off my student loans and bump my monthly contributions to \\~$4200, though I'm now making too much to contribute to Roth IRA and transition that money to a brokerage account. At age 52, I begin FIRE, all contributions go to $0 and I begin pulling $10,416 monthly from my cash savings. See my forecasted [contributions chart here.](https:\/\/imgur.com\/hKsG5o1)\n\n**Account Valuations Summary:**\n\nAll of my account valuations steadily increase throughout the rest of my 20s, hitting that $100k invested mark just after I turn 30. As I pay off my car, I see my brokerage account start to grow more rapidly. When I no longer meet the criteria for Roth IRA, I see another jump in rate of brokerage account growth. At 52, I stop all contributions with a projected net worth of $4.1 million. This is where things get tricky, I cannot pull from my 401k until I reach 59.5, so all of my withdrawals are coming from my brokerage account with Roth IRA contributions in an emergency. At 52, my cash account is worth an estimated total of $715k and 7.5 years later is nearly completely depleted at $130k (some margin to prevent needing to withdraw from retirement accounts if possible).\n\nMeanwhile, this whole 7.5 year period my retirement accounts are growing! Just as I'm reaching the end of my brokerage account at 59.5, I begin to be able to pull from my larger retirement accounts. See my forecasted [account valuations chart here.](https:\/\/imgur.com\/YACfvBE)\n\nMy total net worth has grown to 7.4 million and my 4% safe withdrawal rate reaches $290k. See the [net worth chart here.](https:\/\/imgur.com\/eD9Dm4n) Time for a happy retirement!\n\n**Closing Thoughts:**\n\nI did this mostly as a planning exercise and motivation to be more aggressive with my savings goals. It's certainly possible to optimize brokerage account growth to have a more balanced period between FIRE date and 59.5 tax deferred account withdrawal age, potentially cutting off years of work. I also could have included a Roth IRA conversion to balance out retirement income and bring the FIRE date in even earlier. This would take a bit more work to include paying taxes on the conversion, so I haven't bothered to try to include this yet.\n\nI was hoping with a reasonably high income, I would be able to retire a bit younger than I'm showing here. This exercise really shows that it pays to start early. Avoiding lifestyle inflation early on and trying aggressively to get to that first 100k adds nearly a million dollars to my net worth by the time I try to FIRE at 52. I bet with more tweaking of my spreadsheet and more strict limits to lifestyle inflation in my 30s, I could bring that FIRE date in. I'm sure my life will change by then, my intent was really to set myself goals for the next 3-5 years that will set me up for success in the future.\n\nAnything major I'm overlooking in this analysis? Or any thoughts on things I should do differently?\n\nIf anyone would like to take a look at the spreadsheet I set up for this. It's imperfect, but with some tweaking you could use it to do similar forecasting.

People have made valid points about needing to nail down more specifically my expected expenditure so I can plan the stash required. I do feel even with a lowered SWR of say 3.5% that I would most likely already be there as it would be enough to maintain even my current spending in a HCOL location. It is just that earnings are so high at the moment that it would seem a fruitful use of my time to keep working for a little while longer. \n\nI think perhaps I need to plan for more and longer travel perhaps through a sabbatical so that I can trial my post-FIRE life without immediately losing the safety of a paycheck. This could be achievable in the near future and would at least give me something to look forward to.\n\nI guess my question is more a thought experiment. FIRE decisions are always about balancing different interests (financial security versus time). When you are financially reasonably set but don't hate your job, are there ratios of net income \/ net wealth at which it may be more likely to be a good decision to continue working?\n\nORIGINAL POST\n\nI've been on the road to financial freedom for quite some while. I am a single 39 year female with no plans of having children and am getting to the point where I could actually pull the trigger. I have a combined net worth of $1.6 million USD consisting of $1.2 million USD in a global index fund and the remainder as equity in a high-yielding investment property. I am currently living in the Middle East, however I am keen to first go on an extended period of travel and perhaps retire in a cheaper location in Europe or Asia.\n\nThe 4% withdrawal rule gives me spending of $64k USD which should be plenty. However, the future is unknown and taxation in some European countries could become a significant expense if I were to settle there. \n\nI currently earn around $210k USD each year tax free. This is by far the highest salary I have ever had and will not be easy to replicate should I leave my current employer ad ever decide to return to the workforce. \n\nAre there any intelligent formulas or other ways to estimate when it would make sense to quit? My current yearly earnings are about 13% of my net worth. This feels rather high and suggests the uptick to my net worth for each additional year is still very significant and may make it worthwhile to add more years. If the percentage was say 5% it would make it easy to walk away from my job and if it was 30% the case for staying would be very obvious. However, with 13% it is a bit in between. \n\nI am just wondering if anyone has any thoughts on how to approach this \"problem\". My work is easy and not stressful, but I don't really enjoy it and would not miss it if I were to quit.\n\nMy main motivation to quit is that I don't particularly like living in the Middle East. In my opinion it's not the best place to seriously date or otherwise settle down and I feel that each extra year results in me postponing the rest of my life.","upvote_ratio":0.87,"created_utc":1676829360.0},{"title":"Will international geographic arbitrage be harder in the future?","author":"FI-ReDH","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/financialindependence\/comments\/116aio5\/will_international_geographic_arbitrage_be_harder\/","text":"Looks like [Portugal is ending their golden visa program](https:\/\/gizmodo.com\/digital-nomad-airbnb-golden-visa-remote-work-1850127066).\n\n\nAlthough we plan to retire in our native country of Canada, I know many of us in the FIRE community were thinking of using geographic arbitrage for lower cost of living to make our money stretch further and saw Portugal as a post retirement destination. \n\n\nWill you just pivot to another low cost country, or decide you should save and invest more, likely drawing out your working years to stay in your current country and move to a LCOLA?","upvote_ratio":0.88,"created_utc":1676813947.0},{"title":"Can we fire?","author":"soureneye","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/financialindependence\/comments\/116vf3e\/can_we_fire\/","text":"\n41M and 42F married with no kids and one dog.

I\u2019m on a bit of a tangent here but I swear it all ties back to FI so I hope you stick with me.

So take my advice with a grain assault and if something works a bit differently for you then I\u2019d like to hear your take on things too.\n\n#How remarkably similar Health and FI are\n\nEveryone is looking for a quick and easy fix.  People seem to get most of their advice from influencers or advertising rather than sticking to tried and true methods.  Everybody is jumping on fads and hype trains.  The average person is mostly unaware and really not in a great state.  It seems overwhelmingly complicated from the outside.  The government is dropping the ball at helping people with this and corporations are stepping in.  Doing the wrong thing gets you short term pleasure at the cost of long term wellbeing.  Life is more expensive if you don\u2019t have it.  The only thing that really works is effort and discipline over a sustained time.  It all boils down to good habits and a few simple rules.  Once you build the habit it basically runs on autopilot.  Gains compound as the years go by. Having it unlocks more potential for you to achieve bigger and better things.\n\nAre the above sentences talking about money or health?  Well, both.  It\u2019s amazing to me how much the story is exactly the same between the two \u201cspaces\u201d for all intensive purposes.  It\u2019s a bit of a revelation I had after I hit the \u201cboring middle\u201d financially and looked to do new things that weren\u2019t boring.  I sought to own my health the way I owned my money and realized the two had so much in common.  I have no doubt that you, being on \/r\/financialindependence are fully capable of absolutely owning your health just like you\u2019ve owned your money.  It\u2019s worth it.\n\nBlah blah blah.  Take care of your health: we\u2019ve heard it a bajillion times for years.  Very boring  But what if I actually did it: really followed the rules?  Like how I actually followed those great personal finance rules (assuming, since you\u2019re here).  What if I didn\u2019t think those health rules were so out of touch, the same way so many think personal finance rules are out of touch? \n\n#Why Bother?\n\nSince we\u2019re on FI, I\u2019ll mention: being in good health can save you sooo much money.  I can get FI sooner.  Healthcare is hella expensive.  Insurance is hella expensive.  Your body is truly priceless, so if you do it wrong the bills get insane.  Also, getting healthy is cheap!  Healthy food is cheap (more on this later), exercise is cheap (more on this later), and there is another more powerful and deeper thing that saves the most money of all (suspense!).\n\nOutside of money, it\u2019s amazing to see how much of a difference is easily possible.  Take a look at the pie chart of causes of premature death in the west. (https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/nchs\/fastats\/leading-causes-of-death.htm)  It\u2019s pretty incredible.  Cancer, heart disease, diabetes, liver disease, respiratory disease.  Right from the gecko you can see like 75% of premature death is related to lifestyle factors.  Now, you could still get unlucky but you have the power to take almost 75% of your tickets in the \u201cDeath Raffle\u201d (starring Jason Statham) off the table.  Something will still get you eventually but you can probably make sure you get 75+ good years!\n\nOK it\u2019s not all about just being alive, what about quality of life?  It\u2019s pretty close to the same.  75ish% of chronic diseases are tied to lifestyle factors and often quite preventable. Why don\u2019t we just nip all those chronic diseases and deaths in the butt? You can live longer AND better.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s just talking about avoiding disadvantages.  I\u2019m sure you can list a few advantages like looking better, having more energy, being able to conquer greater physical challenges, and being happier.  This was ultimately what I was after: feeling good and the capability to do the activities I want to do for decades to come.\n\n#Well, what are the simple health rules?\n\nThis is a bit off the FI topic so skip if you need to. There\u2019s bound to be some controversy here (always is) but I am posting backup sources.  \n\n#1 Get enough sleep\n#2 Get enough exercise\n#3 Eat good\n\nDetails below.\n\n**1 \u2013 Get at least 8 hours of sleep.**\n\nPrimarily, you just have to actually give yourself full amount of time every night.  But if you have trouble with sleep quality there are [a few tips]( https:\/\/www.sleepfoundation.org\/sleep-habits) to try.\n\n[Why sleep?]( https:\/\/browse.nypl.org\/iii\/encore\/record\/C__Rb21759528__Smatthew%20walker%20why%20we%20sleep__Orightresult__U__X2?lang=eng&suite=def) Ever get a cold after an all nighter?  It\u2019s not a coincidence.  [Your immune system needs sleep. ](https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/niosh\/work-hour-training-for-nurses\/longhours\/mod2\/05.html)  Your immune system also fights cancerous cells and inflammation and respiratory viruses, which it sucks at when you don\u2019t sleep.  [Sleep also produces the human growth hormone]( https:\/\/www.nulifeinstitute.com\/blog\/what-is-the-link-between-human-growth-hormone-and-sleep) that lets you turn protein into muscle.  You can eat all the protein and work out all you want but if you don\u2019t sleep it\u2019ll still mostly get turned into fat.  [Sleep is obviously important for the brain too!]( https:\/\/www.brainandlife.org\/articles\/how-sleep-protects-the-brain\/)  Energy, memory, cognition, mood (happiness).  I hate to be the bear of bad news but [even if you can power through with caffeine, you\u2019re missing out on a ton of benefits by not sleeping enough.]( https:\/\/msutoday.msu.edu\/news\/2021\/caffeine-and-sleep)\n\n**2 \u2013150 minutes of moderate activity per week or 75 minutes vigorous.  Strength training twice per week, and a bit of stretching.**  (At least) (https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=an6LKlx3JH8) (https:\/\/health.gov\/sites\/default\/files\/2019-09\/Physical_Activity_Guidelines_2nd_edition.pdf)\n\nStrong heart, strong bones, strong muscles, good endorphins (happiness), anti-injury, anti-frailty, do more, go farther.  Why does everyone have back pain these days?  Mostly because weak backs and inflexibility sets us up for failure.  \n\nThere\u2019s lots of different exercise programs out there, and many of them are pretty good.  P90X, starting strength, pilates, 0-5k, personal trainers, laps in the pool, zumba, spin, lots of good options (and bad ones too, unfortunately).  If you have some specific goals like muscle building, weight loss, six pack abs, Olympic racewalking records, the splits, or becoming alpha, you can tailor things to you.  Just get started because you can't fix your body with duck tape later.  But start with rule #2 as the baseline and you can\u2019t go wrong.\n\n**3 \u2013 Diet: (a) Half your food should be fruit\/vegetables (b) carbs should be unrefined (c) lean towards plant proteins.** \n(https:\/\/food-guide.canada.ca\/en\/) \n(https:\/\/www.health.harvard.edu\/staying-healthy\/healthy-eating-plate)\n\nThese rules work for me.  What does not work for me is tracking food (counting \u201cservings\u201d, calories, macros, vitamins, minerals, or whatever else.  It\u2019s too tedious.) and this is more actionable for me than Mediterraneanness (is this avocado Mediterranean enough?  What about this sushi?). This is the anti-cancer, anti-cardiovascular disease, anti-diabetes, anti-oxidant, anti-inflamatory, anti-hypertension, anti-obesity, anti-tooth decay, high protein, low saturated fat, high vitamin, high mineral, low confusion, low hassle diet for forever.\n\nThis is also the scientific consensus.  Your influencer might like keto better but scientists like this.  \n\nWhy these food rules?\n\n(a)\tYou can do a whole lot with just this rule.  It almost speaks for itself.  Practically every vegetable is a \u201csuperfood\u201d in its own right and if superfoods are half your diet you are already killing it.  Vegetables are no contest the best nutrient\/calorie out there.  They\u2019re so filling they make it hard to overeat (thus calorie counting, which is a real pain in the ass, irrelevant) and so nutritious you don\u2019t really need to count vitamins by default.\n\n(b)\tCarbs are the villain du jour for a while now.  Carbs are fine, good even, y\u2019all are just eating the crappy ones.  Sugar and white flour, but [especially sugar]( https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=dBnniua6-oM&t).  Carbs like oatmeal, quinoa, whole wheat, brown rice, barley, chia \u2013 these aren\u2019t the Carbs you\u2019re looking for, Joe Rogan.  High in [fiber](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=EtnTuTX4L24&t), nutrients, more filling, less calories, less boom-bust blood sugar.  So much goodness and lots of energy (you have to fuel Rule #2, remember).  This rule was maybe the trickiest for me, because sugar is hidden in so many foods I thought were healthy (yogurt, granola, cheerios, almond milk, pasta sauce, protein bars, salad (dressing), health drinks, bread, and with the sauces that sneak onto everything).\n\n(c)\tI\u2019m not saying go vegan.  I am saying cut back on [processed meat (a group 1 carcinogen, the same group as smoking), and red meat (group 2A carcinogen)]( https:\/\/www.who.int\/news-room\/questions-and-answers\/item\/cancer-carcinogenicity-of-the-consumption-of-red-meat-and-processed-meat), cheese (like meat, just so much [saturated fat]( https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=qwSMgZYAaZU&t)) and add in more lentils, beans, and nuts.  [Lentils]( https:\/\/fdc.nal.usda.gov\/fdc-app.html#\/food-details\/172421\/nutrients) and [beans]( https:\/\/fdc.nal.usda.gov\/fdc-app.html#\/food-details\/747444\/nutrients) have more protein per calorie (and per dollar too) than [ground beef]( https:\/\/fdc.nal.usda.gov\/fdc-app.html#\/food-details\/746779\/nutrients) .  [They are just super good for you](https:\/\/nutritionfacts.org\/video\/beans-beans-theyre-good-for-your-heart\/), vitamins minerals fiber and so on.  There are some hardliners who say veganism is the healthiest diet, some say pesco-vegetarian, some say we\u2019re all lactose intolerant, nobody can agree about eggs.  The jury\/science is still out on a few things but either way the scientific consensus is that the West is eating too much animal products for it\u2019s own good.\n\n\n(d)\tWhat? There was no rule (d) listed above.  Well this is a bonus rule.  Rule (d) is that rules were meant to be broken.  Any diet that doesn\u2019t let you eat cake on your own birthday is stupid.  If you really fully follow a,b, and c even just like 80% of meals, then your diet is so damn good it basically won\u2019t matter if you have some treats on occasion.  This diet is for your whole life, not for yo-yo boom and bust.\n\nYou can add or adjust rules to fit your personal goals, but in my opinion this is the baseline to start from.  Less meat, cheese, and sugar - more vegetables, whole grains, nuts and legumes.  So simple. It\u2019s not rocket appliances.  I think it\u2019s pretty hard to argue with that, but people will.\n\n#But how does this help me be FI?\n\nNumerous ways.  Less medical expenses is obvious.  But you also get more years and healthier years to work (or not work) which gives you bonus time to become more wealthy.  Costs go down AND earning can go up: you are getting two birds stoned at once.\n\nAnd eating healthy is WAY cheap.  Oatmeal, quinoa, peas, beans, lentils, tomatoes, bananas, apples, squash, carrots, cabbage, brown flour, brown rice, peanuts, potatoes, onions, yams, corn, beets.  All these might be like $1-2 per pound.  A whole day\u2019s food might be like $5.  Way cheaper than fast and processed food and way healthier too.  People who say healthy food is expensive must not realize you don\u2019t need organic, or worse they might be buying ultraprocessed expensive dumb supplements, juices, bars, or shakes that probably have a load of sugar.\n\nExercise is cheap too.  A pair of runners and a trip to \/r\/bodyweightfitness can get you going.  Although you might want more, like some basic gear like a \/r\/homegym or a bike.  Exercise can be way cheaper than some other entertainment sources, like fancy electronics or hitting the bar or shopping on Amazon.  No exaggeration: in some cases, two pints at a pub will cost more than a month gym membership.  Commuting by foot power is way cheaper than a car.  It saves money in the short and long term.\n\nBut the real, most profound cost savings that I kept you in suspense about (not really) from the beginning is that good health makes you happy.  [Science shows](https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/learn\/the-science-of-well-being) that good health is a major factor in being happy.  Happy people aren\u2019t as susceptible to advertising to fill the void in their life.  They don\u2019t need consumerist junk.  They don\u2019t need to scour amazon for joy or get expensive status symbols for validation.  They don\u2019t need to smoke or drink to take the edge off.  They aren\u2019t cranky because they are tired and low on blood sugar.  Will following my rules make you happy?  No promises but science says it helps.\n\n#How has this worked out for me, so far\n\nGood actually.  It\u2019s been more than a year since I starting bringing these rules in and they are autopilot now.  If I eat fast food I actually get a bit of tummy discomfort now, so the rules are truly easier to stick with than not to.\n\nMy skin looks better.  I can see a bit of abs showing even though I\u2019m not trying for that.  I\u2019m looking trim while watching my cohort at work get fat (sorry y\u2019all, I\u2019d sugar coat it but im following Rule 2b).  I\u2019ve made gains with weights and my resting heart rate is down to 54 bpm.  I have pretty good energy levels for an old guy.\n\nAnd I\u2019m saving money like crazy.  My food costs like $60 per week.  I have no health issues to pay for.  I have a  $1,000 home gym which is now free entertainment. And love my surfing and biking and hiking which is also close to free.\n\nAnd I\u2019m happier.  I\u2019m so much better at dealing with stress at work.  My body just feels good most of the time, which spills over into my mood and so I just mentally feel good.  I like people more and have been socializing a bit better.  I didn\u2019t used to be like this.  I used to be tired and stiff, cranky and stressed.  It's not always perfect but it's better than before.\n\nWhat else is there to say?  Honestly, I just recommend giving it a shot.\n\n*Anybody wants to talk recipes or workouts I\u2019m down.  It's a bit off topic for FI though.","upvote_ratio":0.91,"created_utc":1676730936.0},{"title":"Has news of a critical\/ terminal illness of a person affect you ?","author":"pieredforlife","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/financialindependence\/comments\/115gbdp\/has_news_of_a_critical_terminal_illness_of_a\/","text":"42m this year. $290k. 1 year of living expensses in cash.

I have a pretty clear path to FIRE. But why am I not happy?\n\nMy job is not stressful, but not at all what I thought I'd be doing with my life. But it's flexible, I love working remote and the team and my boss is great. I am allowed to travel anywhere I'd like in the USA.\n\nMy girlfriend (dating 3 years now) is pretty great but she's going through some health issues so we're living with her parents while she heals (probably another year here). This causes me some stress but I am using this time to try to focus on my personal growth. Their house is beautiful and the parents are great but it's not really where I want to live nor do I ideally want to live with parents. As I said above my job allows me to travel within the USA, I just need a stable internet connection, but my girlfriend can not travel right now, so anywhere I'd go I'd be going alone.\n\nI contribute about $1,100\/month for groceries as \"rent\", the rest of my regular expenses are probably under $250\/month, and anything else above that is discretionary \/ for fun, probably another $400\/month. **So my total spend is about $1750\/month.**\n\nI have a few hobbies that I enjoy  (mountain biking, video gaming, exploring, volleyball).\n\nI have one friend who I want to say is a good friend but in reality I'm a better friend to him then he is to me.\n\n# After FIRE life\n\nI've always wanted to go back to school for genetics or nanotechnology. I'd like to work on improving the human body. Cure diseases, make humans live longer, give humans technology based super powers. But I feel I can't achieve this goal until I am financially independent. If I don't earn the money first then I'll always have to work and who knows if I'll be successful or still like biology stuff after being in it for 5 years. I've thought about starting online biology courses during my FIRE journey to get started and learn, but this wouldn't count towards college credit.\n\n# My solution?\n\nSo my  thought is try to earn **MORE** money so that I can reach FIRE faster! So I am in the process of getting my Real Estate license to try to become a loan broker, which is what my girlfriends father does and he is willing to teach me. I could probably do this on the side while keeping my W2 job.\n\nOther ways of making more money include growing my side business, but max I could probably only double this income. I've also been juggling with several other online business ideas, but the point is I could devote more time to making more money.\n\nBut this would still not solve my problem of now, that **I am not happy.**\n\nAny thoughts on what you think would help.

Saving an extra 5%\/yr is relatively easy. I could have done this without major lifestyle changes, just smarter spending\/saving. \n* **+10% savings\/year (33.3% avg):** Total net worth $980k (+89k). Saving an extra 10%\/yr would have required some sacrifices (less social activities, mindful spending), but would have been feasible. \n* **+15% savings\/year (34.8% avg)** Total net worth $1.02M (+$133k). Saving an extra 15%\/yr would have been tough without some lifestyle changes (less travel, cheaper rent). Looking back I'm not sure this was feasible given my desire for balance. \n\n**Ok so final takeaways:**\n\n* Save early and often. Time in the market beats timing the market. \n* Pay yourself first. Max your retirement accounts if able (at least to the free match) and then auto-draft from each paycheck into a taxable brokerage account. \n* Invest in a low cost, broad based index fund like the S&P500 (VOO) or Total Market (VT). \n* Increase your annual savings rate! Even +5% can make a big difference in the long run. +15% can be life changing over 30 years. \n\n\n**Note**: I will definitely be editing this multiple times to fix the table formatting.","upvote_ratio":0.93,"created_utc":1676663751.0},{"title":"Daily FI discussion thread - Friday, February 17, 2023","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/financialindependence\/comments\/114fuu4\/daily_fi_discussion_thread_friday_february_17_2023\/","text":"Please  use this thread to have discussions which you don't feel warrant a new  post to the sub.

Divorce can be very costly and result in the loss of half of your assets and retirement savings. Furthermore, being with the wrong person can be emotionally and financially draining, leading to poor financial decisions and potential financial ruin.\n\nHaving children also adds significant costs and responsibilities, which can delay early retirement and reduce financial independence. The costs associated with raising children, including healthcare, education, and basic needs like food and clothing, can be substantial and may require additional income to cover. This can make it more difficult to achieve financial independence and increase the likelihood of becoming a \"wage slave\" to support the family.\n\nFor those who value early retirement, it is important to be very careful about who they pursue intimate relationships with. Additionally, those who are serious about early retirement should consider being childfree or getting surgical sterilization, such as a vasectomy or bisalp, to prevent unwanted pregnancies.","upvote_ratio":0.28,"created_utc":1676794209.0},{"title":"Pre-retirement anxiety","author":null,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/financialindependence\/comments\/115cwrs\/preretirement_anxiety\/","text":"I\u2019ve been planning for retirement my entire career and I thought I was ready.

Is this normal, does anyone have any tips how to ease into retirement\/sabbatical without fear?\n\nI bring in about $10k in dividends and spend $7k on average per month, but after taxes it\u2019s cutting it a little tight. I have a few big expenses coming up for my house and really don\u2019t want to sell any stock because of what the market is like. I can cut monthly expenses but I really don\u2019t want to penny pinch or downgrade my lifestyle. I know $7k a month sounds like a lot but after mortgage and various bills I must pay there\u2019s not a lot of expenses I can cut in the short term unless I sold my house and car which is a little dramatic.\n\nMy biggest anxieties about retiring right now are that I\u2019ll be forced to sell stock or \u201cwaste\u201d a bunch of money taking a break and end up having to downgrade my life. I\u2019ve lived very lean for a long time and only just started treating myself.\n\nEdit: My anxieties are partially the mental aspect of moving from saver to spender. I am confident in my long term investment strategy. With a saver mindset I have a problem with the idea of selling right now and if anything I should be beg, borrow and stealing to buy right now. I planned to work through the downturn but was laid off so I am executing my long term plan a little earlier than anticipated and should be excited but I\u2019m worrying maybe unnecessarily.","upvote_ratio":0.5,"created_utc":1676718093.0},{"title":"Our Roth Conversion vs. ACA Strategy","author":"HereToLern","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/financialindependence\/comments\/1145955\/our_roth_conversion_vs_aca_strategy\/","text":"I stumbled across some really great case studies here of people working through the calculations for Roth Conversions and ACA subsidies (u\/curiously\\_clueless).

Or maybe you see one of the posts about job hopping to improve salary, while you\u2019ve been stuck in the same job for several years.\n\nHere\u2019s a different take, brought to you by the good people at Archie Comics (FYI - album should be 5 slides): \n\nhttps:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/vLvzsxo\n\nI remember reading this strip almost 30 years ago and it has stuck with me ever since.\n\nArchie gets the better paying job, but Jughead comes out ahead in the end.    A simple reminder that the higher paying job isn\u2019t always the best, especially if a lower paying job gets you home for dinner every night with your family.   It might come with an extra commute, nights\/weekends at the office, time away from family\/friends, maybe it puts you in a VHCOL area, etc.  Of course, if you're working like Archie but getting paid like Jughead, then you have a different problem.\n\nEveryone has different views of FIRE and how to get there.  Some people do whatever they can to maximize earnings, but I prefer the Jughead route.  I have a job that pays well, is super flexible, and has a great work\/life balance.  I could chase the higher paying jobs\/promotions, but I'd be giving up the minimal stress and tons of free time I have now.\n\n[Similar to the Gergich style, \"The best part about working at the Parks department was that I got to be home every night with my family at 5 o'clock, and to me that\u2019s what mattered most.\u201d](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=GTbJEIXU1Ms)  \n\n\nThe obvious counter is if you Retire Early, you get all the free time and family time you can handle, but not everyone can get the higher paying job or constant promotions or can handle that kind of grind.

I live in a HCOL area. My company has announced that 85pct of the staff will be cut and I am expected to be impacted in second half of 2023. I currently make $196k on base plus about a $100k in bonus and my spouse makes about $36k. All figures are annual. On being separated I will get 20 weeks of severance pay plus a prorating on all stock options not vested. My current situation is as follows:\n\n1. No debt\n2. Paid off home worth $750k\n3. 6 months emergency funds\n4. Almost $1M in retirement assets\n5. 4 months ahead on budget and trying to get to 6 months\n\nThere are multiple schools of thought about finding another job. Some are asking to wait for severance and then look while others are asking to start looking right now. I have started looking at the moment for the last one month or so and am not even getting one interview (just getting rejected on application). This is the hardest I have seen finding a job in the last 20 years that I have worked. \n\nMy monthly expenses based on take home pay adds up to $8825 which includes additional retirement savings, 529plan savings, buffer for health insurance in future, vacation savings etc. If I don't have a job, living where I am I can bring this down to $4300 a month which would not include any savings. I am looking for input on the following and would be grateful for any suggestions:\n\n1. 6 months Emergency savings plus 5 months severance plus 6 months ahead on current average spending of $8825 per month gets me to 17 months. If I reduced this to $4300 a month, it will stretch even further. If I add unemployment insurance it can stretch even further. Do I need to panic now?\n\n2.

I have been following this sub for a long time and thought I was on track for FI in <10 years but had major pause when I heard one of my colleagues (same specialty and similar salary) say that there's no way she'll ever be able to retire before 65. I'm turning to this sub for a sanity check since I think this other physician has a very similar lifestyle to myself. I make average for my specialty (and household wise below average, as many physicians are married to other physicians), and I don't know anyone who has retired early so that's another point giving me pause. \n\n**Income: $520K pre-tax, and about $370K post-tax** (my income is about 420K, SO makes 70K, and I have a pension worth 30K\/year.

In reality, I should be able to do it a bit quicker than the current estimate since once I become a partner in my practice in 2 years, my income will go up about $200K pre-tax (about $100K post-tax) through profit-sharing, all of which will go into my investments. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAm I missing something or am I really about 10 years from FI currently?","upvote_ratio":0.51,"created_utc":1676438194.0},{"title":"Daily FI discussion thread - Tuesday, February 14, 2023","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/financialindependence\/comments\/1120pfb\/daily_fi_discussion_thread_tuesday_february_14\/","text":"Please  use this thread to have discussions which you don't feel warrant a new  post to the sub.

In my early 20s, I was thrilled to play video games all night, but that same activity in my 40s brings much less, or possibly no, joy. Our sources of enjoyment change as we go through different stages of life.\n\nI remember the wise words of Charlie Munger, \"Invert, always invert.\" While it's challenging to define what is enjoyable, I can easily define what is not fun and strive to avoid it. The FIRE lifestyle often provides a means to achieve this.\n\n* I dislike interacting with people who do not share my values. Some people may be irritating to me, but that does not mean they are bad. I acknowledge that some people simply do not get along and prefer to keep my distance from them.\n* I dislike getting involved in trivial annoyances, such as dealing with a noisy neighbor in the early morning or someone who loves to complain or argue with me. I want to be able to distance myself from those who bring negativity into my life.\n* I dislike being alone and unable to share joy and excitement with my close family members, particularly my spouse, children, siblings, and parents.\n* Additionally, I dislike being overweight or lacking physical activity. After 40, it can be difficult to get back in shape due to a sedentary lifestyle and a slower metabolism. I want to hit the gym, play sports I enjoy, and maintain good health so I can enjoy good food even more.\n\nInterestingly, **avoiding these dislikes does not have to cost a fortune. And guess what, no matter what stage of life you are in, your list of dislikes often remains unchanged.**\n\nTraveling the world, supporting a good cause through a donor-advised fund, or driving a nice car can bring a degree of joy. However, I am not willing to trade any (or **all**) of these joys for any of the dislikes I just mentioned.\n\nI suggest creating an \"I dislike\" list and figuring out the minimum net worth required to avoid them. You can then use the 4% rule to calculate the target net worth and consider it your lower-bound net worth for FIRE. Any amount above the target can be considered excessive. Furthermore, most of the time accumulating money through work often comes at the cost of accepting certain dislikes, I guess.\n\nFor those planning to retire in their mid-50s, I suggest using the unconventional 5% rule instead of the 4% rule so you can pull the trigger a bit earlier. This is because (1) social security benefits typically become available around age 65, and (2) unless in excellent physical shape, people tend to engage in less physically demanding activities that don't require extensive travel as they enter their 60s. These travel-related expenses, such as flights, cruises, and hotels, can often be the most costly. (3) Life is short and one's last day on earth may arrive unexpectedly.\n\nIn conclusion, **the key to pursuing FIRE lies in minimizing the things you dislike and maximizing worry-free time in life, rather than pursuing desires or wishes.** Don't save much more than you actually need and please avoid becoming too rich in the graveyard:)\n\nFood for thought.\n\nI would love to hear your \"I dislike\" list. What are your top items?

In contrast, it is currently possible to rent a good apartment for $2.5k\/mo.\n\nI've looked at rent vs. buy calculators that use typical home value increase rates and rent increase rates, and they show that, with current mortgage rates, I'm better off renting even at 30+ years.\n\nIn general, I've assumed that it's better to buy for FIRE, because long term you lower your required monthly expenditures. However, the housing prices and current mortgage rates are so high, that I'm less sure of that here.

And the calculators' difference in net worth in 30 years is large enough that it seems like I should at least consider renting.\n\nI also suspect that housing prices here may not follow normal growth trends, due to the geographic constraints.

A while ago, I realized that doing a task yourself, and therefore avoiding paying for someone else to do it, can be thought of as a sort of fine-grained \"self employment\".  It can be even better though, since by doing a task yourself you legally avoid a ton of taxes (sales tax, income tax), conflicts of interest, and various business overheads like advertising and bureaucracy that add costs.  Plus, you have a guaranteed buyer.\n\nI commonly hear people make the argument that \"You'll be paying yourself less than minimum wage\".  This is usually true, but doesn't capture the whole story.  For one, avoiding $100 of spending is better than earning $100 through formal employment because you fully capture the economic value you add and avoid overhead.  There's also very little friction for you to spontaneously cook a meal yourself for just one night compared to committing to a job at a restaurant.  It's also not always possible to exert more short-term effort at your day job to produce a proportional short-term increase in income.\n\nOf course, one should also remember the benefits of specialization in society.  I contracted out my most recent HVAC repair since I'd be over my head for that job despite doing simple plumbing and electrical repairs on my home recently.  The key is picking tasks that don't have a high skill or capital barrier to entry to perform competently.\n\nThe last thing to consider is that many of these small chores can actually be enjoyable, since they add variety to your daily activities and prompt you to learn new skills.\n\nSome examples I've experienced recently:\n\n1. By cooking, I am \"self employed\" as a chef, busboy, and waiter\n2. By biking to work and avoiding car costs, I am \"self employed\" as a mechanic, oil rig worker, car salesman, insurance actuary, and perhaps even a doctor since I'm more healthy for it.\n3. By making home repairs, I'm \"self employed\" as a carpenter, plumber, and electrician\n4. By maintaining my own PC, I'm \"self employed\" as an IT worker\n\nI should note that I'm not advocating for everyone to become subsistence farmers.  Specialization is part of what makes wealthy countries great.  That said, being self-sufficient for easy core activities can sometimes be more efficient than contracting them out.","upvote_ratio":0.8,"created_utc":1676074983.0},{"title":"Daily FI discussion thread - Saturday, February 11, 2023","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/financialindependence\/comments\/10zhjk0\/daily_fi_discussion_thread_saturday_february_11\/","text":"Please  use this thread to have discussions which you don't feel warrant a new  post to the sub.

Have a well-maintained 2017 Toyota Camry. Bought a new vehicle six months ago, sold it for an $18k loss recently because it felt financially irresponsible to drive a nicer car, even though I worked hard for it and it wouldn't have impacted my finances too much if I kept it. I regret selling it, but I also know I would have regretted keeping it, cause I had been dwelling on what to do with it for over a month.\n\n=====\n\nLonger version:\n\nI apologize if this type of post is not allowed, but I'm wondering if others have come across similar situations, and more importantly, I'd like to know how others have overcome the challenge I'm dealing with at the moment.\n\nFirst, a little bit of my backstory. I am a 29 y.o. engineer in a medium COL city in Texas, and I've taken FIRE seriously ever since I began working in 2016. My parents struggled with money throughout most of my childhood and adolescence, at least from what I can remember, and I went into debt to pay for in-state college tuition. I also took out a loan for a used Honda shortly after my first internship in 2015. Because of this, I felt a strong need to prioritize paying down debt to increase my net worth as quickly as possible. My first job paid $85k annually, and I received raises and a promotion to a new role over 3 years, which put me at $110k per year. By the time I completed my 3rd year working, it had been a while since I finished paying off all debt. My savings habits were also fairly strong, in my opinion. I had a budget, and I had no problem sticking with it, prioritizing savings and investment goals over my \"fun money\" fund.\n\nIn early 2020, my Honda was totaled, and I needed a vehicle to commute to the office. I found a great deal on a certified pre-owned 2017 Camry with 10k miles for $16k, and I jumped on it. I took out a small loan to take advantage of low interest rates, and paid it off within the first six months. Later that year, I also found a new job. Career-wise, it was a lateral move and not necessarily a promotion, but my compensation increased to $300k per year. I was quite happy about it, and the salary increase allowed me to save even more aggressively for a down payment on a home.\n\nIn mid 2021, I bought that home and gave a 20% down payment (about $90k). I don't yet regret making that decision, and I'm still pretty happy about it. I got a low-enough interest rate, and all things considered, I only had to re-categorize my original budget from 2016 a little bit in order to make it work. I bring up my feelings regarding that financial decision because typically a home is the biggest purchase a person makes in their lifetime (at least in America), and while I was quite anxious about it at first, I got over it pretty quickly.\n\nA year later, in mid 2022, I decided to take a close look at my net worth. Since 2016, I had been pretty diligent about maxing out my 401k, Roth IRA and HSA, as well as consistently buying into the market every month with post-tax dollars. I was a bit surprised to learn that my retirement, brokerage, and savings accounts, as well as my home equity, were valued at around $650k. The \"surprise\" factor was there because I was still spending roughly the same amount of money on food, housing, and utilities since 2016. I was not spending much, if at all, on traditional luxuries like nice clothes, fancy trips, or expensive car payments. Looking at my total net worth made me realize that maybe it was time to do something \"nice\" for myself. The first idea I had was buying myself a \"nice\" car, so that's what I did.\n\nI bought a $70k (after taxes) new vehicle in July 2022. It was my first new car, and I was over the moon. I envisioned myself driving it to the ground over the next 10-15 years. I gave a $30k down payment and financed the rest at 2.5% over 48 months. I did not sell my Toyota, even though I could have gotten more than I paid for it due to the crazy used car market of 2022. I, instead, let my brother drive it since I knew he needed a car while he is living with my parents and starting his career in real estate.\n\nI drove my new car for five months before visiting my parents and brother for the holidays. I quickly found out that no one was driving my Toyota, because my brother was driving my mother's car, and my mother was carpooling with my father to work. This made me feel like my Toyota was just wasting away on my parents driveway. I was still reluctant to the idea of selling the Toyota, since the car was in excellent shape, paid off, and with regular maintenance, it would run without major issues for a long, long time.\n\nI took my Toyota back home with me last month. Nearly every day of January 2023 I thought about what to do, since having two cars for just myself makes no sense. I had to sell one of them, not doing so felt financially irresponsible, especially given the looming recession. I did not want to sell my Toyota because I knew I could count on it to run without major issues for at least another 10 years, but I also did not want to sell my new car because I felt like I had worked so hard and for so long in order to be able to afford it without severely impacting my FIRE trajectory.\n\nIn the end, I decided to sell the the new car and keep the Toyota. Due to market conditions, as well as the manufacturer recently dropping prices on the model I purchased, the best offer I could get was $52k. I took it, and realizing that I \"spent\" $18k to drive a nice car for 6 months made me feel like a massive idiot. Some days, I wish I could undo that decision. Other days, I feel like it truly was the best decision I could have made (the next best one would have been never buying the new car to begin with since I had a perfectly good car already).\n\nHow do others deal with this type of expenses? How do you overcome money anxiety? I think the tipping point for me was the feeling of financial recklessness due to having two cars but only really needing one. Looking back, I could have very well kept both and driven them both regularly, without breaking the bank or screwing up my FIRE trajectory. I'd like to hear about others who have the same FIRE mentality, but every once in a while, decide to treat themselves in a way that is appropriate to their income levels or net worth.

I\u2019ve always been a Roth guy so this advice has always somewhat confused me. Please enlighten me if I\u2019m thinking about something wrong.\n\nThe argument for pre-tax vs. Roth is usually this: if you choose to do Roth contributions, that money is post-tax, so you have less money to invest and grow. This is not really true, unless having that money taxed means you have less to invest in your budget. If you are maxing your 401k ($22,500), doing so with Roth contributions will result in the same amount invested, only you paid more taxes on your paycheck. Then, years and decades later, you will never pay taxes on your contributions OR the potentially massive amount of gains you will make; you will have initially just paid a little more tax on your paycheck for that money specifically.\n\nMeanwhile, with pre-tax contributions, sure it is a good way to reduce your up-front taxes (and I fully recognize this advantage), but decades later you will be responsible for taxes on all the money INCLUDING the possible substantial gains. Based on the above, the benefit of pre-tax over Roth just doesn\u2019t add up to me. I have read many articles and threads on the topic and I feel like they are all making the same flawed point: that you have less to invest if you are doing Roth. So please, knowledgeable people of personalfinance, tell me what I am missing!\n\nEdit: Very thought provoking comments in this thread. Not to stifle the thoughtful conversation going on, but my takeaways so far are:\nTrad is useful for qualifying for ACA and tax benefits, trad will result in higher gains because you can invest the money you save on taxes, and it is still useful to have a mix of trad and Roth money to draw on in retirement.","upvote_ratio":0.84,"created_utc":1675949445.0},{"title":"Backdoor Roth IRA conversion for a nonworking spouse for 2022 in 2023.","author":"HumbleSami","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/financialindependence\/comments\/10ywfow\/backdoor_roth_ira_conversion_for_a_nonworking\/","text":"MFJ: \n\nBefore 2022, we have never contributed to IRAs.\n\nI have already performed backdoor Roth Conversion for myself for 2022 and 2023.\n\nNow, I have recently started contributing to my wife's IRA in 2023.

If someone has been saving in their 401k diligently for many years, their total pre-tax assets might be in the millions.

But there are potentially two important factors with this that would cause this plan to fail:\n\n* Not enough years between retirement age and 72, depending on when you retire early (or even IF you retire early at all).\n\n* A pre-tax amount that is simply too enormous to convert efficiently; one that would require conversions of such a high amount per year, that it would essentially produce the same tax liability issues as RMDs would.\n\nAfter all of this:\n\n1.

We're both 31 years old and work full-time. My 20's were a time period where I bounced between jobs and didn't save much, I made the predictable silly mistakes like buying stocks and making\/losing a few bucks and spending far too much, but never invested in the ways I could have been. Now that I'm a bit older and wiser I'm looking more towards the future... I'm starting to max out my IRA (13k saved at this point, which I consider a huge step for me!) and plan to do so into perpetuity.  \n\n\nMy boyfriend only just started working a career type position and seems to enjoy his job so far. He's been there for \\~7 months and is doing quite well, and I think he has a plan for his future prospects that puts him into a position to move up in a career path and increase his earnings. The problem is, he's bad with money stuff. It's not like he's out spending cash on a new car or expensive clothes, he just doesn't have a concept of savings or interest. He's told me before that he'd prefer if I handled all the financial stuff, he thinks I'd be better at it, but whenever I try to bring up some things he's hesitant to talk about them.  \n\n\nI understand we're both (relatively) young, and we're on track to increase our earnings pretty rapidly as we get older. I'm on track to finish my M.A. and start a new career next year, he's on track to move into a higher paying role within a few months, but I'd like to make sure we have the systems in place to see our retirement savings grow.  \n\n\nAny advice on how to approach the topic without being overbearing? We're pretty open about how much we make, he shows me his bank balances\/debts and I show him all of mine, but it seems like when I ask him to commit to making changes he's hesitant.\n\nEdit: I appreciate the overwhelming number of comments I've received on this. I'm going to take the advice offered here and schedule a time for us to sit down and have a talk about goals and planning.

We were asked to liquidate our 401k positions to cash on Jan 5th so the accounts could be transferred to the new provider. The final date that funds are scheduled to be fully vested under the new provider is Monday Feb 6th. In the month that our accounts sat in cash, the SP500 gained 8.62%. \n\nAn 8.62% gain in the market represents about $28,000 of gains that I missed out on for reasons that had nothing to do with my investment strategy. I am a buy-and-hold index investor. I held through the brutal year of 2022, knowing that if I held onto my positions through the down market, I would be rewarded when the market rebounded.  Well... The market rebounded, and I missed it anyway. \n\nChanging 401k plans has no benefit to the employees that I can discern. The new provider has a UI that is more difficult to use and a much more limited selection of investments to choose from. The new plan also doesn't allow for after-tax non-roth contributions or in-service transfers, making mega backdoor Roth conversions out of the question. The decision to change providers was made by the company, for the company's benefit. Shouldn't the costs and risks involved be shouldered by the company? Why are employees being forced to time the market with their retirements savings? This isn't some abstract expected value calculation - I can tell you *exactly* how much this transition cost me, and that figure is $28,000. \n\nI've lost my temper during a few conversations with upper managers on this subject and I'm admittedly having a difficult time maintaining my professionalism. Coworkers are telling me I should calm down and saying things like \"It could have gone the other way\"; \"the market could have gone down\"; \"you shouldn't be too results oriented, we just got unlucky, the expected value of being out of the market for a month is much less\".  None of this makes me feel any better!  The fact of the matter is that my 401k balance would be $28k higher today if this transition was never forced on us. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation? There's nothing that can be done about it at this point, so there's probably nothing to gain by complaining to everyone about it.  I feel sick over it though and I can't stop thinking about it. \n\nOne last comment to help put this into perspective - The IRS employee contribution limit for a 401k is $22,500 in 2023.  I will have to max out contributions for more than an entire year to make up for this loss!  Also, the SP500 has a historic nominal annual gain of 11% if you include dividend reinvestment. My retirement account will be $640k lighter than it should have been in 30 years.  This has a huge impact on my FIRE plans.\n\nEDIT: Thanks for the responses.

Specifically, I\u2019m trying to get an idea of how my fianc\u00e9e and I are doing and what our next steps should be.\n\nI\u2019ve been passively pursing FIRE as a goal for maybe four years now but I\u2019ve gotten to the point where I kinda feel a bit lost as to where I should invest my time and money next. I also sometimes worry that we\u2019re not very \u201con-track\u201d with regards to our FIRE journey since we started saving later.\n\nI\u2019ve been investing pretty consistently (albeit with pretty inconsistent monthly amounts) since I started but if I\u2019m being honest with myself, I don\u2019t have a real strategy or proper allocations. I\u2019ve been considering a financial advisor but I\u2019ve also seen compelling arguments saying that it isn\u2019t worth it due to fees.\n\nFor context, I\u2019m a 32m living with my 31f fianc\u00e9e in a MCOL midwestern suburb. We are both Software Engineers working remotely and have a household income of $315k (she makes $135k and I make $180k). Here\u2019s an outline of just my current financial situation:\n\n~$65k in cash (currently in a standard bank savings account - working on moving over to a high-yield savings account)\n\n~$62k between two brokerage accounts\n\n~$12k in a Roth IRA\n\n~$40k between a few 401k accounts\n\n~$100k in home equity\n\n~$25k in car equity\n\n~$16k in student loan debt (which I\u2019ll probably pay off in lump sum once it begins accruing interest again)\n\nMy fianc\u00e9e doesn\u2019t really have any net worth yet due to some previous debt she\u2019s been paying off (started a small business but it didn\u2019t work out). However she\u2019s been paying it off aggressively and will have all high-interest debt paid off in about three months. \n\nShe only recently changed careers and started making a lot more money so despite not having anything saved yet, she\u2019ll be able to save quickly after payoff. She\u2019s never really been in the FIRE mindset before recently. Mostly due to her having debt but that\u2019s quickly changing as she approaches being free of that debt. She\u2019s been working really hard to get there and I\u2019m really proud of her.\n\nIn terms of the investments that I currently have, they\u2019re mostly in well-known ETFs like VOO, VGT, VYM, VNQ and a few similar ones. I\u2019m able to save probably 60% of my income easily but I don\u2019t have a specified amount that I invest per month. It\u2019s usually like $2-$5k per month but sometimes I invest less than that if the market is daunting (like during this past year).\n\nI\u2019m not currently contributing to my company 401k because they don\u2019t offer a match. In general, I\u2019m kind of averse to investing too much into 401k due to all the limitations for people intending to retire before 65. I know there are some caveats to this but 401k accounts make me nervous due to feeling like my money is really \u201clocked up\u201d. I\u2019m curious as to what others think about this.\n\nAll in all, I\u2019m very interested in what this community thinks about our current situation and FIRE potential. What are we doing wrong and what should we be doing instead? Our early retirement goal is far from set in stone but we\u2019ve discussed that it would be great and possibly feasible to retire at 45-50 with $2-$4m. It\u2019s also likely that we wouldn\u2019t completely retire and do nothing (at least until a later age). We\u2019d likely still do some part time work or contracting. My fianc\u00e9e is ridiculously crafty and I could see a possibility of her starting a small creative business. I\u2019ve also thought about starting a small business myself one day but who knows.","upvote_ratio":0.37,"created_utc":1675623772.0},{"title":"what are some alternative living situations to FI faster?","author":"mikel0202","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/financialindependence\/comments\/10t4tfy\/what_are_some_alternative_living_situations_to_fi\/","text":"I've seen people live in tiny houses, house hack, rent a room, etc..

We're planning to pay for some of their education, but leave them responsible for the rest (presumably with loans).  We haven't decided exactly how we're going to handle the split between us and the kids, but our initial thinking was to cover about half.  I was not involved in this process when I went to college (my parents setup the loans, and I paid my parents, who then paid off the loans).  **At the bottom****, I'll outline some of the details about our financial situation.**\n\nHow will our financial situation influence our kids ability to obtain loans for college?\n\nOutside of the 529 plans we setup (which I understand wouldn't be a taxable situation), are there any other tax considerations for any extra income we will need to take to help pay for some of their college expenses?  I'm assuming our income will need to go up when our kids are in college.  I know that we can also take Roth IRA contributions out tax free, but would rather avoid doing so if possible.\n\nAre there also implications for health insurance? We get coverage through the healthcare marketplace (our kids get Medicaid), and I'd also assume that this extra income needed to pay for college would impact that coverage.\n\nI'm considering this now, with 4 years left before our kid's go to college because it seems like it would be good to start taking extra income now in preparation for college expenses, to even the income out (for optimizing taxes).  Is it a sound plan to try to spread out that income in the years leading up to potential\/probable spike in expenses due to impending education expenses?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDetails:\n\n* We have \\~45,000 for each kid in 529 plan\n* We're 44 and 46 years old\n* Our current expenses are about 43,000 a year for a family of 4 (expecting this to go up when they are in college)\n* Our assets are located as follows 12% Roth IRA 26% IRA 1% HSA 61% taxable investments\n* We have no idea at this point where our kids will end up going to school.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet me know if you need any more detail.","upvote_ratio":0.87,"created_utc":1675451198.0},{"title":"Rate the plan pls:","author":"Sebvad","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/financialindependence\/comments\/10tncvo\/rate_the_plan_pls\/","text":"Age 50, married, spouse intends to work until 67 and her salary covers our current annual expenses of $70k with our home fully paid off.

I thought that skiing would be the same and so I never picked it up. An acquaintance wanted to take a road trip and check out Gay Ski Week, so I said yes! This was double SYT(A)A event because I usually don't do \"gay party\" type of events.\n\nI was absolutely wrong about skiing. It was so much more fun than snowboarding, I picked it up quickly, and started doing some blue routes on the second day. I definitely would ski again, but would NOT do it in the context of gay ski week (there way too many vapid WeHo twinks, and the party scene is not my cup of tea). Also I would try mid-week to avoid crowds and cut down costs.\n\nAs part of SYT(A)A, I decided to go take a 3 week trip with someone who I had only known for a few days (in person). Lesson learned, is that for travel, I need to make sure that I am more compatible with. After the first three days, I offered to pay to fly him home and cancel the rest of the trip because of how terribly it had started. We decided to continue and there were good parts, but there were some pretty awful parts of the trip and during the ski portion, I avoided him completely.\n\n**Cruise to Alaska**\n\nMy mom had been asking me to go on a cruise with her for at least 15 years and I've been extremely hesitant. I hate the idea of a \u201ccatered\u201d experience and also loathe the super restrictive schedules and super-touristy nature of cruise ships. But given this year's Mantra of SYT(A)A, the absolute worst case is that I get to spend 10 days with my mom. Turns out I didn't need to go on the cruise to know it wasn't for me. I\u2019m glad to spend the time with my mom, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever take a cruise ever again in my life.\n\n**Bedroom Adventures**\n\nI won't go into specific details here, but I've been exploring a lot of new things in the bedroom (kinks, fetishes, people with different gender identities\/sexual orientations). I've had a range of experiences from \u201cso-so\u201d to \u201camazing\u201d and has overall been a very positive experience. I feel like without the SYT(A)A mentality, I would never have discovered things that I now really enjoy. As a side benefit, I am in high demand for a particular niche that I also happen to enjoy a lot, which is a major plus for my sex life :-)\n\nGiven all of the positive experiences that went well, I want to keep the SYT(A)A mantra going forward and continue find reasons to say yes.\n\n**What are some things you want to find say yes to, but haven't quite made the leap?**\n\n# 2022 Highlights\n\n* Spelunked to the end of Catacombs Cave (and back :-D ) at Lava Bed National Monument. There were some belly crawls with less than one foot tall ceilings with about 1-2\" of wiggle room between your back and the ceiling. In some parts, I had to turn my head\/helmet sideways to squeeze through\n* 5 day trek in Pati Valley in Chapada Diamantina\n* Climbed Via Dos Italianos (700ft) and K2 on Corcovado (400 ft) in Rio De Janeiro. I only had to hang once on the first pitch of Via Dos Italianos\n* Led my first 5.10a, also led a 5.10b\/c (both sport, and the 10b\/c were very soft IMHO) and led my first multi-pitch route\n* Did my first packraft trip (3 days).

I spent 243 days away from home to be exact. All of this was with different friends\/family with the exception of spending \\~3 weeks solo in Brazil. Here\u2019s the travel that I did last year:\n\n* 3 week road trip to Vegas, Red Rocks, Death Valley, and Mammoth\n* 6 week trip to Brazil\n* 2 week road trip from SF to Seattle\n* 4 day road trip around the Olympic Peninsula\n* 10 days Alaska cruise and Denali Land Tour\n* 9 days Visting friends in AK and Vancouver\n* 10 day NYC and DC trip\n* 30 days of outdoor climbing in various places\n* 7 day road trip around Utah national parks\n* 5 day board game convention\n* 3 weeks in Thailand and Taiwan\n\nI tracked how many days I spent away from home, and categorized them by the type of accommodation that I had:\n\n* Hotel\/AirBnb\t71\n* Family 69\n* Camp\/Hipcamp 56\n* Friends 39\n* Vehicle (bus\/plane) 6\n* Volunteer 2\n\nFamily\/Friends I stayed at for free (mostly my sister in Brazil and my mom in Washington) and I treated people out to dinner and other things for letting me stay with them. Camping was a mix of state\/federal\/BLM\/Hipcamp. Most of these are like $15-$25\/campsite split usually among 2 or more people. Lastly the remainder is for Hotels\/AirBnB\u2019s. I used Marriott points for the expensive destinations like NYC and DC, but most of my nights were in cheaper locations like pousadas in Brazil, and inexpensive hotels in Thailand and Taiwan.\n\n**Volunteering - Summer Camp Blues**\n\nSo I did not get accepted to join one summer camp despite previously getting the \u201cMVP award\u201d and praise from a variety of people. Initially I was devastated and was thinking about what I could do differently to get back. When I asked for feedback from one of the directors on how to be a better candidate for the next year, they gave me feedback that is factually incorrect. When I ran this by my co-counselor from the previous year to get a second opinion, they agreed and thought it was unfortunate that they were single-ing me out. The director citied \"issues with my cabin\" as a main reason for not being allowed back, but my co-counselor (in the same cabin) noted that they never received any feedback and were also invited back to volunteer. The root cause of this is that I provided them direct, but professional feedback on things that I think they should change. However, it is now apparent that it was not received well and they have twisted the series of events to fit their own narrative. After talking to others, it seems like the people in this organization are just looking for \u201cYes-people\" and can\u2019t take any form of constructive feedback.\n\nI haven\u2019t been this disappointed in a long time, and because my other summer camp still not running in-person camp, it meant that I now had a big 2 month gap in my summer, and a hole in my heart that I needed to fill. I still haven't quite found a way to find a way to replace this, but what I do know, is that I need to go somewhere where my talents and skills are appreciated and I'm not gas-lit to think that I did something wrong.\n\n# Finances\n\n**Net Worth:** Decreased from $1.90M to $1.50M (as of January 1st 2023)\n\n[Asset Allocation of Net Worth](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/9NAH9y1) \n\n**2022 Income**\n\n* Dividends from Taxable Accounts: $16.7K\n* Long Term Capital Gains: -$4.9K.

[Here is an example](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/financialindependence\/comments\/10qtpwv\/aca_subsidies_fire_considerations\/j6s5h06\/) that might be more concise than this post. \n\nSo I came across an interesting conundrum when running simulations for my current FIRE status. I figured I'd share, and see if I'm missing anything. Please note that all numbers in this post are for 2023, single filer. I've included a link to my Python script at the bottom if anyone wants to look it over (it's messy, but shouldn't be too hard to follow). \n\n**Current Consensus**\n\nWe all know the general implications of ACA subsidies: if you're shooting for a withdrawal strategy that's less than 400% of the federal poverty level (FPL = $13,590 for single filer), then it's wise to attempt to suppress your MAGI in an effort to maximize the subsidy. The question is how should we alter our tax planning strategies, before retirement, to optimize the impact of the 'new' structure of healthcare subsidies.\n\nOne way to look at it is similar to how we look at the federal tax rates. The common wisdom, of course, is that if you're in a higher tax bracket now than you project to be in retirement (i.e. 24% bracket now vs 10% bracket in retirement), then it's prudent to place those funds in a pretax account (IRA or 401(k)) to save that net 14%. \n\nI think the same exercise can be done for ACA subsidies: if we assume that the max possible subsidy is the baseline, then every dollar paid for ACA health insurance is effectively a 'tax'. But first, we need to understand how the subsidies are calculated. \n\n**How are the ACA subsidies calculated**\n\n [Here is a great resource.](https:\/\/www.healthinsurance.org\/faqs\/is-the-irs-saying-ill-have-to-pay-more-for-my-health-insurance-next-year\/) About a quarter of the way down is this excerpt:\n\n \n\n>For coverage effective anytime from 2021 through 2025, under the modified rules implemented by the American Rescue Plan and extended by the Inflation Reduction Act, subsidy-eligible enrollees who buy a plan in the exchange have to pay the following percentages of their income, after the subsidy is applied, for the benchmark plan:  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>Income up to 150% of poverty = 0% (ie, the subsidy is enough to make the benchmark plan premium-free)  \n>  \n>150% to 200% of poverty = 0% to 2%  \n>  \n>200% to 250% of poverty\u00a0 = 2% to 4%  \n>  \n>250% to 300% of poverty = 4% to 6%  \n>  \n>300% to 400% of poverty = 6% to 8.5%  \n>  \n>400% of poverty or higher = 8.5%\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou can run through the example for Bob from the reference if you want to see exactly how we calculate the ACA cost if you land in between these income thresholds, but the important thing to take away is that **this structure does not behave like the federal income tax bracket - for the ACA, every dollar you earn increases the percentage taken from all previous dollars**. \n\n**Here's an example:** \n\nIf you make 2x the FPL ($27,180), you'll be charged $543 for ACA insurance. If you increase your income to 2.5x FPL ($33,975), you'll be charged $1,359. What this means is that the last $6,795 of income cost you $816 in additional insurance premiums, or 12% on a marginal basis ($816 \/ $6,795). \n\nIf you can't already tell, this can be quite impactful when you add this on top of the federal income tax. \n\nSo while the ACA is not treated like a marginal tax, we can still solve for the effective marginal tax rate by income level - basically, how much does one more dollar of income increase our amount paid for ACA?\n\n**Effective Marginal Tax Rates**\n\nFor reference, here is a graph of what the [Federal Income Tax brackets](https:\/\/taxfoundation.org\/2023-tax-brackets\/) look like if you charted them out. Note that this includes the standard deduction.\n\n[Federal Income Tax Brackets](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/iVJMDuY)\n\nNow, here are the effective marginal tax rates for the ACA, considering the effects of the subsidy by essentially performing the math exercise from above. \n\n[ACA Marginal Tax Rates](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/3f8pQmm)\n\nNotice that the lines are sloping. This is because the subsidy is a moving percentage of your income. Like the federal income tax, you should be able to find the area under the curve to calculate your total tax liability. \n\nTo find our combined effective marginal tax rates, we just add these two curves together:\n\n[Combined Marginal Tax Rates (Fed + ACA)](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/hoVKZ7r)\n\nAnd finally, here is the graph of the combined Fed and ACA payments in actual dollar amounts:\n\n[Combined Gross Payments (Fed + ACA)](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/zpsapbE)\n\nThe big takeaway for me is that beyond $25,000 of post retirement income, our marginal tax rate will increase beyond 20%, which, for many of us, will be pretty close to what our highest marginal tax rate is while we are working. This is equivalent to $625k in a 401(k) doing 4% Roth conversions (assuming you have no other sources of income). And for those that are shooting for a million dollar 401(k), that last dollar of a 4% withdrawal is taxed at a whopping 30%. \n\n**What counts as income for the ACA?**\n\nThe ACA is based off of Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI). MAGI will include virtually all sources of income. This includes Roth conversions, capital gains, rental include, etc. And there is no tax break for the standard deduction - all income is counted for the ACA. The only source of 'income' not included are plain Roth withdrawals.\n\n**Implications for FIRE Planning**\n\nThis is certainly something to seriously consider if you are planning to do BaristaFI (or CoastFI) with income supplemented partially by both Roth conversions & a part time job. \n\nFrom what I can gather, this really levels the bar for the Roth vs Traditional debate once you hit a certain threshold in pretax accounts. \n\n[Here is the link to the Python script](https:\/\/controlc.com\/88e0da79)\n\nI've also included the ability to account for capital gains tax. As you can probably gather, if capital gains are your sole source of income, the first $40k is free for federal income tax so the marginal rates equal the ACA marginal rate chart until capital gains tax kick in. So I didn't include it here. \n\nI imagine there is an optimization exercise one could run to figure out the perfect mix of pretax (with planned future roth conversions) plus capital gains. But I suspect, beyond the minimum federal poverty level income, it becomes increasingly advantageous to switch to Roth-only contributions while working. \n\nAnyway, let me know what you think. I'm sure I've made a pivotal error somewhere that makes this entire exercise a big nothing burger. I'd love to hear it. \n\nAlso, I realize that the thresholds set for the ACA maximum premiums may not fully reflect the prices you see on the marketplace, and that we may be able to find cheaper deals. I haven't had to get coverage on the Marketplace yet, so I'd love to hear people's experience if the above doesn't line up with reality.","upvote_ratio":0.93,"created_utc":1675255192.0},{"title":"Take the Tax Deduction with Trad or open a Roth IRA","author":"chedncheese","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/financialindependence\/comments\/10s23od\/take_the_tax_deduction_with_trad_or_open_a_roth\/","text":"TL;DR: I can make traditional IRA contributions and have the benefit of tax deductions but I'm worried about making more money in the future and ending up with a headache due to taxes\/penalties on mixing contributions if I have to go the backdoor Roth contribution route \n\nOkay, I acknowledge that this has been asked before in many different ways but I feel like I need reassurance and some people who are better at financial math to help me out.

I'm in digital marketing in a MCOL area and don't plan on moving to SF\/NYC\/etc, so I'm likely not on the track to make silly good amounts of money (as in I can't fathom the idea of more than 80,000 simply because it's a lot of money to me), but that doesn't mean life won't be kind and that I'll end up being in a tax bracket where it becomes less beneficial to go the traditional route.\n\nAlong with this, I don't plan on having kids, but I ideally would like to get married.

I do this stuff by hand on Excel.\n* The periods that didn't follow this pattern were the windows starting in 1953 to 1970, which experience the brunt of the Great Inflation, particularly when Portfolio 2 is starting to invest.\n\nGenerally speaking, one-year abnormal returns and inflation periods don't affect numbers too much. It's the multi-year periods of bad returns or inflation that can really affect the results.\n\nBottomline:\n\n* Invest early.\n* If you're in the middle of a Great Inflation \/ period of low returns, don't stop investing.\n\nSources:\n\n* S&P 500 Returns: https:\/\/www.slickcharts.com\/sp500\/returns\n* Inflation Data:

I guess the annuity thing sounds a bit too good to be true, but wanted to get everyone's thoughts.","upvote_ratio":0.44,"created_utc":1675266574.0},{"title":"Daily FI discussion thread - Tuesday, January 31, 2023","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/financialindependence\/comments\/10pvafy\/daily_fi_discussion_thread_tuesday_january_31_2023\/","text":"Please  use this thread to have discussions which you don't feel warrant a new  post to the sub.

It was great at first, but after 4 different presidents and 6 supervisor changes, the job became less fulfilling. My job is very niche, and not many people understand the extent of my role. However, I\u2019m always in demand and it is just me in my department(minus the overseas contractors I manage). Lately I\u2019ve been having to defend my job and it felt like they were trying to find a way to fire me. Anyways woke up one morning and knew I didn\u2019t want to do this anymore. I looked at my finances and realized I could go without a paycheck for 6months on my emergency fund alone. When I put in my resignation letter, a huge weight was lifted off my shoulder. I was happy again for the first time in 6 months. I may not have enough to retire yet but damn does it feel good to not be at the mercy of a company just to survive. \n\nThe rest of this is just a rant so feel free to stop here. \n\nThe kicker, during a meeting with my boss to discuss who will replace me. They said that they couldn\u2019t find anyone to replace me as they wouldn\u2019t go for the salary I\u2019m paid. I gave my boss the look of \u201cGee I wonder why\u201d. Raises have been dangled in front of me my entire time here with the company. I\u2019ve saved the company potentially millions of dollars in lost revenue and losing a new contract by gapfilling slots in our overseas contractors rotations. Recently saved $250k by meeting a extremely tight deadline. Basically we promised our customer a new aircraft every month. Each month we don\u2019t send them a new plane, we lose out on $250k on our contract. Hats off to the person who over promised. We still have 3 more aircraft to go. Anyways, after 3 years of bending over backwards for no recognition and having to defend my job it is time to let the company see how important my role is.","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1675086678.0},{"title":"Should I drain my investment to pay off half of my debt?","author":"waxing-mystic","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/financialindependence\/comments\/10qjso6\/should_i_drain_my_investment_to_pay_off_half_of\/","text":"Hey all,\n\nI\u2019ve got 25k in debt and 25k in student loans. \n\nI landed a job that pays well so I\u2019ve made a budget, but I\u2019ve got to do it again since it makes no sense, but I think I can roughly pay off 1k\/month to the debt (give or take when student loans come out and if I\u2019m actually budgeting correctly)\n\nI\u2019ve got about 20k in investments and about 2k emergency fund. \n\nShould I drain my investment to pay off my debt?","upvote_ratio":0.46,"created_utc":1675223571.0},{"title":"Invest HSA funds or wait to rollover?","author":"Hotsummers15","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/financialindependence\/comments\/10q6tu1\/invest_hsa_funds_or_wait_to_rollover\/","text":"My employer switched HSA providers this year.

(can someone link that post)\n\nWell, this is a logical expansion of that post because that's true until infinity and the end of time. I have a chart that shows this for 100 years to fit in a Reddit post, but you can extend this until infinity (or until Excel breaks) and it'll still be true.\n\nThis is due to compound interest in that by the 10-year mark, the portfolio of the first person will have grown so much that its returns now outpace the Roth IRA contribution limit and so that it's basically impossible for the second person to exceed the first person by force of math. That assumes they make mostly the same investments, of course.\n\nThis will vary depending on your expected rate of return, 8% works out to need 10 years. A higher rate of return needs less. A 7% expected return will require 11 years of savings from Portfolio 1 for it to be true. As returns go lower, it requires more years of initial saving.\n\nYou can logically expand this to include any type of account or saving.\n\n**This is also evidence that savings from your first decade and the compound interest on top of that will comprise of the majority of your portfolio, even for an infinite amount of time.**\n\nBottomline:\n\n* Start saving early\n* And when you are at FIRE, don't wait another year (or rather you don't have to work, do part-time or coast to let your investments do the work)\n\n**EDIT**: For those wondering why I didn't account for inflation in annual saving columns, I do via the rate of return. 8% is a real return, net of inflation.\n\nAnd yes, upon looking at this again, this doesn't account for sequence of returns risk. A calculation fully accounting for variable returns over time is beyond my capability. This was meant to be a simple post expanding upon the previous post on PF.\n\n**Updated formatting**\n\nYears | Portfolio 1 | Annual Savings 1 | Expected Rate of Return 1 | Portfolio 2 | Annual

a net worth of $106,600! I've been super excited to write this post since I first read about FI back in 2020.\n\nJan 2022 net worth: 27k. Started working full time as a Manufacturing Engineer in a new state in Feb 2022.\n\nPost-tax 2022 earnings: 75k. Post tax 2022 savings rate: 82.5%\n\nMy savings method was to max out my IRA first, then 401k pre tax, then continue to contribute to 401k post tax while depositing some money in a Vanguard taxable account. I also maxed out my HSA, though because my employer's plan doesn't allow for depositing the full limit at one time, I did that over the course of the year. This method worked out pretty well and I'm going to do it again this year.\n\nInvestments: 85% Stock (70% US, 30% International) 15% Bonds. I used Total Stock Market\/Total Bond Market Index funds in my IRA, HSA, and Vanguard accounts; my 401k didn't have total stock market fund options so I used smaller index funds to approximate the total market.\n\nMonthly Budget: \\~$925 total, with some variation in the power bill and gas costs from month to month\n\n|Rent (Includes some utilities)|572.50|\n|:-|:-|\n|Groceries|80.00|\n|Utilities (power and internet)|\\~66.00|\n|Phone Plan|15.00|\n|Car Gas|\\~40.00|\n|Auto Insurance|82.18|\n|Health Insurance|44.89|\n|'Fun' Spending Money|\\~24 (or whatever's left)|\n\n'Fun' Spending includes everything from restaurants and outings with friends to toiletries and mailing packages. In addition to that I had a 'Saving Goals' Fund of about $2000 (funded by the relocation stipend I got while starting the new job) that I used for doctor\/dentist deductibles, car maintenance (new spark plugs, oil changes, car wash, etc.), birthday\/Christmas presents, and travel over the holidays.\n\nIn 2022 my savings goal was 80%, and I met that by spending \\~13k of my \\~75k earnings. Since 80% was pretty achievable, my goal in 2023 is to get my annual spending down to \\~12k or, if not possible, to at least stay at a >=83% savings rate- mainly by lowering spending from that 'Saving Goals' Fund. I've been really inspired by Jacob from Early Retirement Extreme, who has lived on roughly 7k a year for the past 10 years. In the long term I want to get my spending to at or below 10k, by moving to a cheaper shared house\/apartment closer to where I work. Currently I'm in a 2 year engineer training program that transfers me to a new factory every 6 months, and since my current apartment is roughly equidistant from the major plants I don't want to move until I get my permanent assignment.\n\nOverall I think I'm in a good spot financially. I've set my annual spending post FIRE at 20k\/yr as a safety net, so my FIRE number is around $611k (7% tax and 3.5% withdraw rate), which I should reach in 5.9 years. But I've got a lot of work to do on the 'soul searching' lifestyle part of FIRE. I have no idea what I'd like to do if I don't have to work; I don't have many hobbies. I need to get into an exercise routine I can maintain, right now I get very little physical activity (40 min bike ride once a week) and I've got some mental health concerns that I need to improve before I can think about leaving my employer's health insurance plan.\n\nI've got some work to do, but I'm very proud of the budget I've kept and the amount of money I've saved this past year, and I'm ready to keep going!\n\nEdit: I'm getting a lot of grief on the '$24 fun' number, so I'll elaborate. \n\nYeah I don't go out much at all, possibly once or twice a month. 'Eating out' for me is an appetizer at buffalo wild wings or the Mexican place across the street that has really good $3 tacos. Doesn't have to be a $20 meal to be a good time. When I hang with friends we watch movies at each other's houses, or walk their dog at the park, or go sledding. It's fun, low-zero cost stuff where we have fun and enjoy each others company. Once summer comes around I want to go biking, thrifting, visit a dark sky preserve, etc. Bars, clubs, festivals, and the like aren't my scene and I wouldn't frequent them even without FIRE\n\nToiletries: I have a roommate and we've got an agreement that she pays for toilet paper in exchange for me doing more of the chores and we're fine with that. I don't use paper towels or tissues, reusable hand towels and handkerchiefs for the win. All my shower supplies are bought at the dollar store, my hair does fine with $1.25 conditioner.

This may be rather basic but I\u2019m a bit new to FIRE concepts. I\u2019ve been steadily investing 15% of each paycheck into my employer 401K, 7% to pre-tax and 8% to Roth. My employer matches up to 4% as well, so this amounts to about a $600 contribution a month. I also automatically invest $150 per month into an individual investment account.\n\nMy main question is, is my employer Roth IRA the same as an actual Roth IRA, or should I open up a separate one and contribute more to that? I see a lot of posts about the benefits of Roth IRAs on this sub and I\u2019m not sure what I\u2019m doing is basically the same thing. \n\nAlso, is there anything I can do differently to better optimize FIRE? For example, should I invest that extra $150 a month straight into my 401k instead of a separate account?\n\nThanks I\u2019m advance! Let me know if more info is needed to answer this.\n\nEdit: This has been very helpful! I\u2019ve decided to open up a Roth IRA, roll the maximum from my individual investment account into it, and continue investing from there.

I own a duplex (live in one side and rent the other) and I almost live rent free.

I'm planning to go back permanently to EU in about 1.5 years. I just learned that if I'm an EU resident I cannot buy ETFs in US. The only option is keeping an US address and not inform the brokerage that I moved to EU but this doesn't seem sustainable for a permanent move. Also, this could complicate my situation since I need to show that I'm not resident of California otherwise I'll keep paying state taxes.  I'm trying to figure out what to do to prepare for this. My expectations is that I would need to withdraw regularly probably after 5 years but that dependents on my work situation too. I could potentially FIRE but I would not if I don't need to.  I  have these options in mind.\n\n1) option 1: keep the same portfolio. Rebalance it before converting it to an international account (e.g. using Schwab). Stop dividend reinvestment. Since I cannot buy I cannot explicitly rebalance the portfolio. If I'm in a withdrawal phase then I could withdraw the right assets to keep the portfolio balanced. But if I don't need to withdraw then I need another strategy. I could sell stock ETFs that go up and convert them in eur and buy some CDs or something else less correlated to stock as real estate investment or gold. Or I could buy individual bonds (not ETFs)\n\n2) convert my portfolio to a target fund but this is not optimal because my portfolio has a different composition as compared to traditional target funds. I also know that a target fund in a taxed account could trigger big capital gains when they do some kind of rebalancing.\n\n3) just keep the portfolio as it is and forget about rebalancing. It means that in the accumulation phase I will not get the benefit of having uncorrelated assets (i.e. sell what goes well and buy stocks that are low).\n\nIt also means that whatever savings I accumulate from another job I would need to invest them differently like real estate or something that does not break the EU and US rules.\n\nAny other advice to share?","upvote_ratio":0.65,"created_utc":1675039154.0},{"title":"Most important DECISION you made so far that helps you massively towards becoming FI?","author":"BenjaminPav","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/financialindependence\/comments\/10nzljo\/most_important_decision_you_made_so_far_that\/","text":"What was the most important DECISION you made so far that helps you massively towards becoming financially independent?\n\nFor me it was quitting alcohol.

We\u2019ve had a close focus on our finances since we graduated college, and we now have a clear strategy and system that makes everything seem automatic. My wife is a high-earner (\\~$170k\/year) and more career-driven, and my work is freelance and more sporadic. We have a 2-year-old child, so the part-time freelance work has allowed me to spend lots of time with our daughter.

Key expenses included:\n\n* $56k taxes (a bit high this year due to timing of taxes paid)\n* $20k rent and utilities\n* $12k giving\n* $10k education for a postgrad\n* $10k travel and entertainment\n* $6k food (includes groceries and dining out)\n\nOur country has some advantages that keep our expenses lower. Our rent is paid with pre-tax money, so we\u2019re effectively receiving a 30% discount on rent. Because of the discount, we have no plans to purchase a property anytime soon. Childcare is super cheap, and we pay about $150 per month for daycare. We also live in a city that does not require a car, so we take trains or cycle pretty much everywhere \u2013 our local transportation costs in 2022 were $750 total. You can probably say that these lower expenses are offset by our higher tax bill.\n\nOur 2022 after-tax savings rate was just over 50%, which included $10k in non-recurring education costs and $12k in giving. We were able to invest $95k in 2022, which included a bit of carry-over cash from the end of 2021.\n\nAlthough we dipped from the two-comma club back to the one-comma club, we\u2019re happy to be purchasing stocks at a discount.

I'm currently heavily invested in the Total Stock Index. \n\nSelling or landlord'ing has the same effect on my FIRE date. \n\n=====\n\nHi All,\n\nI\u2019m at a financial fork in the road and I\u2019m looking for advice on which way to go.\n\nThe situation: I am relocating out of state about 1000 miles and can\u2019t decide whether to A. rent out my primary home or B. Sell to buy my new home in another state.\n\nIf I rent it out, it would make me a first-time landlord. Having read a lot and interviewed a couple of property managers, I have no direct experience in this endeavor. I would also need to draw a line of credit against the home to come up with a down payment on my 2nd home.\n\nIf I sell, I plan take the cash remaining after my 20% down payment and invest the balance into a total market index fund.\n\nOf course, the main objective here is to accelerate FIRE and maybe create some cash flow for \u201cfun\u201d so I am looking for any advice and input on thing a novice may have not considered. With that intro out of the way, here are the stats.\n\nPresent home stats:\n\nMortgage balance $100k\n\nCurrent PITI: $1700\/mo\n\nComps in the area $500k - $600k\n\nPotential rental income $4k\/mo\n\nScenario A. Rent out: If I HELOC to come up with 20% down payment and rent out, the calculations tell me I\u2019d net about $5k\/yr after all expenses including management, repairs, vacancies. Of course, I get the benefit of my tenant paying down the mortgage and any appreciation in the housing market, albeit more difficult to access than selling shares.\n\nScenario B. Sell: It will leave me with approximately $250k - $300k to put into an Index Fund. Theoretically, I can draw 2% of that each year and net the same \u201cfun money\u201d without the headache of being a landlord. The market will likely perform better than that, growing yoy on average behaving similarly to the housing appreciation in scenario A, only this one is much easier to access if I want to.\n\nThe math tells me to sell, but my gut tells me to keep the house. What do you guys think?

But the plan rule says HCE cannot contribute more than 16% of their salary combined across all 401k sub accounts (pre-tax, Roth, after-tax). \n\nThe plan administrators mentioned that they **typically** don't fail the ACP and ADP test due to the 16% limit on HCE. \n \nI just crossed the HCE limit in 2022. Even though I'm not an HCE for 2023 per the base salary, the bonus might put me over $150,000 in 2023 by a thousand dollars. Per the plan administrators I'll still be considered as HCE regardless of the bonus in 2023 because of my prior year (2022) salary. \n\nI have the following questions: \n\n1. When the after-tax 401k sub account is rolled over to the ROTH IRA by mega backdoor ROTH (MBR) strategy, the contributions will be tax free going into ROTH IRA. The earnings will be tax free if moved to a Tradition IRA. If I move the earnings to the same ROTH-IRA along with the contributions, the earnings will be considered as interest and will incur ordinary income tax. When moving the earnings to the ROTH IRA along with the after-tax contributions, will there be a 10% penalty on the earnings because it was pre-tax and it was distributed before the retirement age?\n\n2. At what amount (or less) does the MBR strategy is not worth the hassle? I know this is subjective but I wanted to see what others think. I plan to contribute to pre-tax $22,500 in 2023. If I tried MBR, I can only do less than $2,000. I'm leaning towards not doing MBR and just going with a taxable brokerage account. I already max out ROTH, HSA, 401K pre-tax, DCFSA, and have LPFSA and emergency fund as well. I am planning to open a 529 plan this year.\n\n3. ~~IF the 16% cap wasn't there and IF the non-safe harbor plan couldn't determine if I was HCE or not until after the end of the year 2023, would it make sense to put as much money as possible in after-tax for MBR but wait for the plan to let me know if I am an HCE or not before executing MBR? If I end up being HCE, I would get the contribution and earnings refunded and taxed on the earnings only. Hopefully without penalty - see question 1 above.  The contribution will be tax free as it was after-tax going in anyway. If I end up not being an HCE, then execute the MBR.~~        \n       IF the 16% cap wasn't there and IF the non-safe harbor plan couldn't determine the HCE contribution limit for  the year 2023 until after the plan year, would it make sense to put as much money as possible in after-tax for MBR but wait for the plan to let me know the HCE limit before executing MBR? If I ended up going over the limit, I would get the excess contribution and earnings refunded and taxed on the earnings only. Hopefully without penalty - see question 1 above.  The contribution will be tax free as it was after-tax going in anyway. At that point execute MBR if possible. \n\nI guess being HCE I have run out of tax advantaged accounts to save in.\n\nThanks in advance for your time!","upvote_ratio":0.47,"created_utc":1674878012.0},{"title":"Do you figure your inheritance into Coast Fire number?","author":"Witty-Commercial-442","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/financialindependence\/comments\/10niqnc\/do_you_figure_your_inheritance_into_coast_fire\/","text":"40s - 2 income HH\n400k combined income\n1 bird still in the nest for 3 more years\n\nAssets\n- 375k retirement accounts\n- 50k taxable\n- 300k home equity\n- 120k annual savings\n\nCurrent debt 300k @ 3% or lower (RE and auto)\n\nWe had kids young and struggled and spent (RV, boat, off road racing, expensive kids travel sports) during our 20's and 30's making 100-120k\/year.

In March of 2021, I got my dream job of working with cancer patients in personalized medicine. Then in May of 2022, I finally closed on my first property!\n\nThe property was a fixer-upper, requiring around \\~18 months of work. I can see myself living at the property for at least five years, the area is wonderful. I had taken on some debt to get the larger projects finished quickly, knowing that my yearly bonus coming in April 2023 would cover it. I had started the process of getting my PMI removed due to all the improvements on the house. I had six months of emergency funds and some cash for the cheaper house projects. The property was already bringing in some cash from short-term rentals (I live in a touristy area). My goals for 2023 were to focus on the smaller projects around the house and pay off last year's debt. By the end of 2023, I should have the interior of the house finished.\n\nIn mid-January, I find a pinhole leak from a hot water line in the walls that caused mold growth. The entire crawlspace and \u00bc of the house needs remediation. I\u2019ll be out of the house for at least a month, living in a hotel.

I'll try to keep this short and sweet.\n\nSo I am currently in the military stationed in Hampton roads, getting out in the next year. Married, with a german shepherd and a baby boy on the way due soon. No debts, 40k net worth (mostly invested... 4k in savings account... cash poor right now). Both 25yo. Wife is a teacher. I work in cybersecurity and have my clearance. I also started an online personal training business in Q4 of 22 that is slowly growing (operating expenses are VERY low - under $300 for insurance, etc.).\n\nGross income now is \\~$118k between the 2 of us, \\~$96k net.\n\n**Short Term:** Planning on leveraging my cybersecurity experience, certifications, degree, & clearance to pull $150-$200k job hopefully. I've been networking both in person and Linkedin. Wife is willing to keep teaching but it's draining her so she doesn't want to do it any longer than she needs to. She's contemplating a career change eventually but would like to see how she feels after having the baby first. Still going to be working on building my coaching business on the side.\n\n**Long Term:** Want to work the cyber job until we're FI. We have our whole lives ahead of us so I have no idea if I'll end up liking the job or not. I could see myself starting my own cybersec company down the road, but also maybe not. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f If the online personal training business is successful I could also see myself semi RE'ing once we are FI and just doing that for some income. I want to live in the San Diego sun, surf when I want, take weekend trips to Nat'l parks, show my kids the world I wasn't shown growing up.\n\n**This next year:** Daycare will cost us $1492\/mo. Planning on saving that in a savings account every month until the baby comes to get used to \"making the payment\" and bolster our savings. I want to have a 6 month emergency fund saved before I get out.\n\n**The Move:** The wife and I want to move back to San Diego. Our decision is either for **A)** Me to apply to jobs here and her to keep working, keeping the same spending and being able to save $50-100k\/year to build up some more savings\/ down payment for a house eventually in San Diego and then move after a few years of that OR **B)** Apply to jobs in San Diego and move there immediately after I get out. Also eventually planning to use my GI bill to get my masters which pays housing allowance tax free (right now that's $3800\/mo in San Diego).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know we've got a LOT of good things going for us and a bright future, I just want to make sure we're heading in a good direction. Financially it makes more sense to stay here for a few years to save some more money, but **we don't know how much longer we can live here**. We long to move back to SD (I was stationed there before), the east coast isn't really the area for us (ESPECIALLY hampton roads). We've taken vacations around us and we also took a vacation back to San Diego for 2 weeks to scope out areas & make sure it was still the same place we remembered\/ still made sense at this stage of life. The only hard thing about living there will be the distance from our family since we'll have our kid BUT our family lives in the midwest and we never want to move back there anyways \ud83d\ude02 We're pretty comfortable with the decision to move back there (and the goal is to buy a house there).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you guys so much for your help and advice.

Less tax efficient than the 529, but much more flexible.\n* Invest in rental real estate. While this would be good diversification, I'm hesitant to accumulate any more debt given the 650k mortgage.\n\nI'm leaning towards making a pretty small prepayment on the mortgage (say 10k), putting a tiny amount in the 529 (3k or so), and dumping the rest in the brokerage account, with the idea that rental real estate can wait until I have more liquidity relative to the existing mortgage.\n\nAm I missing any options?

Attended affordable engineering school with both Academic and Athletic Scholarships covering about half of total cost \u2013 parents did help out with living expenses. Had job related summer internships every summer. Only 1 job offer spring 2011 and didn\u2019t come with benefits so went to Alaska to work on fishing boat, then returned for graduate school. SO always had internship or research work during summer but attended same school with similar scholarships. Even in college I had the dream of not working forever, my plan was real estate, I figured I needed about 10 paid off homes was planning to follow the BRRRR method (before BRRRR had a official name).\n\n1 (2012) Left Graduate school after one semester to take job ($66k starting salary). (finished masters online). SO graduated in Spring 2012 started work ($72k starting salary plus small bonus). Purchased first house with intent to do some live in flip(worked pretty well more due to how cheap we bought it verse our great updates). Got married in fall. Paid down student loans and car loan (combined around $20k loans). My grad school was essentially free as I was a TA. \n\n2 (2013) Raise to 72k plus 10% target bonus, left job I was traveling too much(and too far of commute 80 miles each way) and work was limited and industry hurting(mining) forced 4 weeks unpaid leave. Did get a nice bonus before I left. New Job starting salary 66k. SO raise and good bonus. Purchased first rental house and did a slow BRRRR(not a great deal but cash flowed and learned a lot about construction and rentals)\n\n3 (2014) Had first kid late in year. Both got decent raises and I traveled a lot early in year for work (pipeline work) this made quite a bit of extra in overtime and per diem. \n\n4 (2015) Took risk and moved to Texas(with a 3 month old) for my SO\u2019s job advancement, and state with less tax and more income opportunity. Sold primary residence(sold for 30k more and moved with company so got bonus for selling quickly) and purchased new home. Got a new job with slight increase pay (or close to back to my original pay at first job).\n\n5 (2016) Purchased 3 rental properties from distance.\n\n6 (2017) 2nd Kiddo born (little bit in loss of pay for FMLA time) but also saved quite a but in daycare.\n\n7 (2018) Extra pay wife worked \"turnaround\". Higher spending various items (new a\/c, new cell phones, car repairs, ski trip, kids gymnastics, etc)\n\n8 (2019) 3rd Kiddo Born (lost some pay for FMLA) (but less daycare cost), negotiated large raise towards end of year by getting another offer and moved up to be bonus eligible. (start year pay 93k to 117k+bonus)\n\n9 (2020) Bought land in Mountain\/Ski town (only visited once) and started design on dream home. Also expenses down due to covid (no commuting and less day care)\n\n10(2021) SO left work, sold TX house, moved in with family during construction of house, bought 7 rentals with partner, also \"sold\" 50% of 3 currently owned properties to partner, Building MT House, approved to work remote, lived with family. Expenses down due to limited daycare, remote work, and living with family. \n\n11(2022) 4th kid born, bought 1 rental with partner, Baby #4, moved to Mountain town. Final construction cost was much higher than original budget and took way longer, extra cost not in budget. Expenses down due to limited daycare, remote work, and living with family. Took a ton of time off through FMLA used to test waters of RE in a short Mini-retirement.\n\n12(2023) Put in notice January - Going to have a great year without work. \n\n**Advice (mostly standard FIRE stuff \u2013 tried to add maybe not typical ones)**\n\n\u00b7 Reddit flow chart is great advice\n\n\u00b7 Learn to cook and meal plan (this is more of a life hack to me than FIRE related) \u2013 but meal planning saves time and brain energy. \n\n\u00b7 Work hard while at work but set boundaries (i.e. take your lunch break(I typically worked out, and left work on time(I had excuse of kids and used it) \n\n\u00b7 Use your FU money at work. I used this to set boundaries, speak my mind, ask for raises, ask to work remote, etc. \n\n\u00b7 If have kids use FMLA to your advantage (due to having multiple kids I used FMLA to create extra vacation time for me (granted it was unpaid but well worth it). I even went on week long hiking trip because of this. The way I saw it was a couple weeks now of vacation to work another couple of weeks later was well worth it. \n\n\u00b7 Favorite resources (MMM, MadFientist, ChooseFI, Jillian Johnsrud, Coach Carson, Optimal Finance Daily, Biggerpockets, Todd Tresidder, Michael Kitces, Reddit)\n\n\u00b7 Car \u2013 avoid the payments \u2013 we always bought cash and really just tried to avoid over buying. My SO has only had two cars her entire life and I generally went with cheaper car due to normally traveling far both of us have had pretty limited car expenses.  Cost of ownership overlife time was very small for both of us. Even better work remote and just have on car, we did this for one year but with 4 kids really prefer 2. \n\n\u00b7 Travel Hack \u2013 it really can be pretty easy money if don\u2019t abuse Credit Card\n\n\u00b7 Negotiate Pay \u2013 in 2019 got another offer and used to increase pay from 93k to 117k, not only did this give me more money it really put me on radar of company and got me elevated to eventually being one of youngest shareholder (left before actually bought stock)\n\n\u00b7 Real Estate \u2013 use property managers \u2013 still will have issue but in my experience, they get higher rents thus paying for management fee. \n\n\u00b7 Track spending (I have monthly spending numbers way back to 2013) \u2013 I don\u2019t budget but do forward tracking.\n\n\u00b7 Biking \/ Walking \u2013 chose current location of house based on closeness to schools(walking), grocery store(bike\/car), and activities (bus ride to ski mountain, and bike trail very close, bike\/walk to playgrounds, and long walk to downtown). Our gas expense in new location is going to be basically nothing. \n\n\u00b7 Rethink big expenses \u2013 my idea of rich life was owning a truck and a boat. I quickly realized that the cost of those two were not worth it, I had plenty of other hobbies that cost less and I probably enjoy more. Note \u2013 I probably will buy a boat in the coming years but also will have time to use it. \n\n\u00b7 Geoarbitrage \u2013 We moved to Texas from Midwest and increased pay and reduced taxes a very large amount.

That moved some investments into house networth. Still no mortgage, paid in cash.\n\nThe line is flat often because I don't update my data monthly any longer. Simply prefer to look less often, since it's not top of mind anymore.\n\nYou'll notice we theoretically dipped below my conservative retirement line. Since it's a very conservative line, I wasn't terribly worried.\n\n# A variety of updates\n\n**Work**\n\nThat \"lower paying\" job I had? I left it 3 months later (I hired my replacement). It was a very non-dramatic and boring event. It just wasn't the right job for me. When you have enough money, it's hard to stay in a job you don't feel is a good use of your time.\n\n**Next work?**\n\nWhen I left my job, I decided it was time to pursue another hobby of mine, writing. So instead of getting a job, I started a newsletter. I won't share what it is for doxing purposes, and because I strongly believe in the no self-promotion rules.\n\nThe newsletter worked out far better than I'd anticipated. I started a paid subscription for the newsletter, and started saying \"yes\" to people who asked me to coach them on various topics. While keeping my hours low (at the level I enjoy - which means turning down a lot of work), I ended up making approximately our expenses in income. Quite a surprise how that worked out.\n\nI probably work in the ballpark of 10 hours a week? 6-7 hours writing, and then another few hours of coaching. And zero when I'm on vacation (I pre-write a newsletter or two so I can relax on vacation).\n\n**Time spent**\n\nThe majority of my time is spent on family things. Exactly as planned. We have a teen and an elementary school kid. I get up before either of them, usually without an alarm. I make coffee, and then hang around with them until they both go to school, usually walking the youngest to her school.\n\nMy wife's parents live with us, so they also take a large role in taking care of the kids, giving my wife and I flexibility with our time as well.\n\nThen I take care of our chickens. We have chickens now. How fun is that? I could write whole posts about how interesting chickens are.\n\nI write my next article, occasionally meet with clients, but also do random other hobbies. Video games, book reading, and lots of exercising.\n\nThen when the kids finish school, I pick up my daughter at school, hang out with them at home, perhaps play board games, or watch a family movie together.\n\nI sleep at a reasonable time, because I love waking up without an alarm.\n\n**Travel?**\n\nWe travel pretty often. My wife and I travel together, with kids, without kids, to visit family \/ friends, to visit a random city, etc. With unlimited time, it really comes down to flight prices.\n\n**FAQ**\n\nFirst - I answered a lot of questions in my last post's comments. I'll try not to be repetitive.\n\n**What about your investments?**\n\nHaven't changed our strategy ( \\~50% VTSAX, \\~35% VTIAX, \\~15% VBTLX). Certainly saw a downtick in value in the last year or so. However, since we're not selling anything (considering I'm accidentally making enough to cover our expenses), I don't count it as a \"loss\".\n\n**Edit: How do you rebalance?**\n\n[https:\/\/imgur.com\/TA1PV7l](https:\/\/imgur.com\/TA1PV7l)\n\nIf that link works, it'll show my rebalance sheet, one of the sheets in my master Google spreadsheet. You can see the formulas I use.\n\n**Edit: How do you calculate things?**\n\n[https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/nMrDN4s.png](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/nMrDN4s.png)\n\nLet's see if that works. That should show the formula I use to keep track monthly of retirement estimates, expenses, various projections, etc. Very nerdy.\n\n**Do you think about going back to work?**\n\nI think about it occasionally, but since the newsletter thing is working well, it feels even more silly to go to an office regularly. I don't need the money, and I don't like the idea of having a boss. Just once in awhile a really cool job pops up, and I'm briefly tempted to put my name into the hat.\n\nThe thing which has thankfully decreasing is my vague professional jealousy. It's sometimes mentally challenging to watch the continued career advancement of everyone I knew, since that is a strong external validation. But over time, as I feel more disconnected from those positions, it becomes easier to ignore those feelings.\n\nAnyway.

I tried to post this in personal finance, but for some reason, it was removed right after I submitted it.\n\n*Original Post Below*\n\nI'm hoping someone can shed some light into this situation and let me know if there's anything else I can do aside from the action I've already taken.\n\n**Background**\n\nEarlier this month, I logged into my HELOC account and was shocked to see that I owed over $70K on it. I expected to see a zero balance because I had just finished paying off my $50K loan back in October 2022.\n\nOf course, I immediately contacted the bank. The people over the phone weren't able to help me, so I went into the branch. We were able to see that someone had written a check for $72,300 dated 11\/26\/22 and forged my signature. It cleared the bank on 12\/06\/22.\n\n**What I've Done So Far**\n\n* I filled out a form from the bank and had it notarized. They sent it to their fraud department.\n* I filled out a police report.\n\nI hadn't heard back from the bank in over a week, so I followed up. It turns out they needed my husband to fill out the same form and have it notarized as well since his name is also on the account. Why didn't they contact me right away when they received my form and noticed that they needed one from my husband? I don't know, but that wasted more than a week of time. My husband just had his form notarized and turned it in today.\n\n**What's Odd About the Situation**\n\n*The Amount of the Check*\n\nI found it odd that this happened right after I paid off the loan I had taken out. Over the years that I was paying it off, I never had any issues. Another thing I found strange was that they took $72,300. The total amount I had been approved for was $130K. The amount they took was almost the difference between what I had taken out and what I was originally approved for. If they had written the check for around $80K, it would have bounced. Isn't it strange that they wrote it for such a large sum, but knew enough to not go over $80K? I know this may come across as paranoid, but it makes me wonder whether it was an inside job.\n\n*The Fact That The Bank Allowed it to Go Through*\n\nI still had my original checks on hand at home. My checkbook started with #1001. That was the only check I had written. The fraudulent check was #115 (not even close to my check number). My check book had the bank's old name. The fraudulent check had the new bank's name on it (they had recently bought the old one). The signatures on the two checks looked NOTHING alike. It was clearly a forged signature. When you compare it to the checked that I had signed and all my paperwork from the bank, it looks totally different.\n\n*How the Bank is Handling This Situation*\n\nThe fraud department didn't contact me right away when I submitted my form to let me know that my husband also needed to fill one out. I had to follow up with them myself. When I asked the bank representative to provide me with the contact information for the fraud department (he was the one who I met with and submitted my form), he said that they would not allow him to do that. I was to follow up with him and he would follow up with them.\n\n**What do I do now?**\n\nAt this point, I am not sure what else (if anything), I need to do. I've already talked to the bank, filed a police report, and froze our credit.

FIREing at 40 with roughly $1.3m in assets 50\/50 between retirement and investment accounts, all in SWPPX and a paid off house\/no debt.\n\nSo, I've posted here before over the years with the most recent one being [9 months ago](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Fire\/comments\/uc298l\/should_i_pull_the_trigger_is_it_time_to_fire_what\/). I'm an American living in Japan with a Japanese spouse. I have 4 dual-citizen children. Next week I turn 40. I've dreamed of being done with work by 40 since I was in my 20's. Unfortunately, I made some stupid decisions like blowing a ton of money on cars when I was young. I was raised in a solidly middle-class family where my father specifically chose what he felt was his calling, over money. I joined the USMC at 17, spent 4 years in communications\/information technology. With some real-world skills and 2 years\u2019 worth of college credits under my belt I landed a good- paying defense contracting job doing nearly the same thing I had in the military. I made more money than I ever had and more than my parents combined their whole life. I ate lunch out every day, got a coffee or two from Starbucks and thought I was living the good life. I contributed the bare minimum to max out my employer match to my 401k and saved maybe 5% beyond that. I didn't rack up a ton of debt mostly out of luck because of my high income.\n\nJust over 10 years ago I lost a job I thought I'd have until I didn't want it anymore. I had a kid on the way, I'd just purchased my first house to live in (I'd played with rental properties twice). I probably spent everything I had and then some to get moved in. So, I had a mortgage and at least $10,000 of debt in addition to that just to get my house to a livable standard. I didn't know what I would do. I had no emergency fund, no savings, but I managed to get very lucky and swap the job I had just lost for something better. By sheer luck I swapped a 45+ minute commute to one less than 10 minutes. I stupidly even managed to get a pay bump. What I didn't know is that contract was on its last 18-months when I took the position. I would have still taken it anyway, but I was lulled into complacency by everything working out so well. Then came the end of that contract.\n\nI was offered an opportunity to keep my position, but on a new contract. For those that don't know, each time this happens you have to renegotiate everything. Because the contract had been bid to the bottom dollar, I ended up taking a substantial pay cut. I decided that I was going to stop eating out and figure out a way to spend enough less to make up the difference in my take- home pay. It worked, cooking dinner at home more often, going out less, as well as bringing my lunches and coffee from home easily saved what I had lost.I briefly accepted a different position making what I had been making, but the boss was a micromanager and I couldn't stand being forced to do busy work when there was really nothing to do. One thing that did happen was when I was doing my onboarding, he asked what size shirt I needed and laughed at me when I said 2XL. He tried to give me an XL and it wasn't going to work. I had slowly gained weight over the previous decade and had not been happy with it, but I had just ignored the problem for the most part. I had some minor success dieting, but one small hiccup would send me back to the path I had been on. About the same time, I had to go to the doctor and the nurses giggled when I stepped on the scale. It read 139kg which is 80-100kg more than most Japanese people way. I had a look in the mirror, realized I was 305lbs and miserable. I finally got motivated to change.I had been playing with credit card churning throughout this time. I'd also read Rich Dad Poor Dad at some point a few years before. I don\u2019t remember when exactly, but by late 2014 I came across Mr. Money Mustache. It was the perfect timing with trying to get in shape. I bought a bike, I started riding my bike to work every day, I saw a dietician and got my diet on track. I almost never ate out, stopped buying things I didn\u2019t need and always took my lunch from home.\n\nI built and emergency fund, then managed to hit over $100k in my non-retirement accounts. I kept saving, biking and for the most part living frugally. I had ups and downs. I started training Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu in 2017 I think and that took me from 100kg (I\u2019d lost 39kg\/86lbs by this point) to around 90kg\/200lbs. I felt fantastic. I also managed to knock out of Master\u2019s degree and even squeezed a second Associate\u2019s and Bachelors out of my GI Bill, exhausting all of it by the time of my last course.\n\nI took a look around and realized I hated my job. I was supporting a system that like many large Defense Department projects just didn\u2019t work as designed and there was nothing, I could do at my level to change anything. In the 10 years I\u2019ve been in this role, I\u2019ve worked for 4 different companies on 5 different contracts. That\u2019s a lot of uncertainty. I think I asked the first time if I could FIRE in this sub back in 2018 or 2019 when I had roughly 800k NW. The overwhelming response was to buckle down and keep saving. In January 2020 I went through a contract change yet again, but ended up with the best compensation package yet. The 2 years of the pandemic were personally fantastic. I spent several months working from home in which I built an RV (total waste of money, lost at least $15k in it), gardening and spending time with my kids. I loved it.\n\nAfter 2 years with the best compensation package I\u2019d ever had, the hammer dropped. In March of 2022, a company which I\u2019d worked for 3 times previously was awarded the contract I support and it was the worst! $30k pay cut off the top, no paid vacation, no holidays and no co-payment of medical insurance. I was planning to just stick around until the summer when my children were out of school and enjoy nearly 3 months off with them, but the world still seemed too chaotic to quit. I ended up working through the summer and stuck around to have their fancy pants international school paid for another year. Despite being on what was supposed to be a stable, 5-year contract we\u2019ve been running out of money and hearing rumors of personnel cuts, etc. I was told, unofficially, that my position would be cut in March of 2023.\n\nI had been thinking of my looming 40th birthday and decided I wanted that to be the day I walked away. We had a family meeting, I explained that we shouldn\u2019t have any problem living on 4% of our NW and that was it. I submitted my notice last week with my last day officially being on my 40th birthday. Timing will never be perfect. Inflation is high, the market is down the future is uncertain. While my job has had its ups and downs it took almost no effort and even after all of the cuts was still a 6-figure take home. That being said, I\u2019d rather die tomorrow free than waking up and dragging myself to a concrete box 5 days a week. A few hours before I resigned, I found out my position was solid until at least October, but that did not change my mind. I was asked to name my price to stay, but just said it was time to leave. I have so many things I want to do with my children that I haven\u2019t been able to do because I could only ever take a few weeks off at a time. I\u2019ve booked trips and fun all the way to the summer and I am really looking forward to having all that time to spend with them.\n\nThank you for reading this far. I\u2019ll do my best to answer any questions if anyone has them. I have a paid off house. Approximately $1.3m in SWPPX and a paid off house in Japan. I have another small vacation property worth nothing that I own half of with another friend in Japan. $52k a year or \u00a56.7m a year should be more than enough to cover all of my expenses.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*EDIT\\*\\* - I fixed a spelling error.

At the time I had no clue what I was doing and my advisor helped keep me honest.

Teacher\/Program Officer combo, both with experience working overseas. \n\n**Income\/W2 Employment Summary**\n\n***-Me (31 y\/o) - Program Officer - $77,000 (includes 10% match)***\n\nIn my last update I mentioned that I was actively applying for new positions in my old company looking to get back into that world. Shortly after that post, a competitor recruiter reached out to me on LinkedIn and asked for an informational interview. That call resulted in interviews and, later, an offer. I now work for a competitor where I support international development projects in the education and anti-trafficking spaces. The position is fully remote, with some international travel. The recruiter mentioned it was hard to find people that *actually* know how to speak French and have a background in government compliance (my social service admin work). The job is interesting, my French has been tested and improved a ton since starting, and it's doing good work. But it's still work. I once again find myself in a position where I\u2019m surrounded by people incredibly passionate about the work we do, whereas I\u2019m here to make a paycheck and help people as I try to FIRE. I miss working with people, the kids I taught were great, but I\u2019m not certain there\u2019s a job with the right mix for me. \n\nAll that said, since I\u2019m remote I told my spouse that we could leave our state and go somewhere closer to family (a new priority following our medical scare). I put the ball in SO\u2019s court and said wherever they found a job, we could go. They had a few offers and accepted one within a couple months. \n\n***-Spouse (30 y\/o) - French Teacher - $55,560***\n\nI mentioned last year SO wanting to get back into the classroom and that\u2019s exactly what she did. The nice part was that we didn\u2019t *have* to move. She didn\u2019t love her job, but could stay if she so chose. This gave her the ability to truly vet opportunities and interview them while they interviewed her. She ended up finding a job teaching French again and while the pay she\u2019s currently at is barely higher than the previous role, the salary schedule begins to accelerate quite aggressively within 5 years of where she\u2019s currently at of the schedule. The pension system also allows you to purchase years to accelerate your retirement plans, which we intend to do when she becomes eligible after her first year teaching in the state. The state refuses to provide more information on purchasing until she\u2019s eligible, but from what I can find it would mean a full pension by at least age 50, likely around 55k in today\u2019s dollars.\n\nThis is where my spouse says I\u2019m getting a bit silly, but the good news on this pension essentially means that we could push ourselves to retire earlier (\\~45?), but the extra effort in pushing, combined with the unknowns around market returns and the 4% rule might not actually be worth it when there\u2019s a guaranteed, healthy pension coming at just \\~5 years later that could support most if not all of our lifestyle. This essentially means that, while we will continue to save and invest for the unknown and\/or catastrophe striking again, the FI game is essentially gone. We just need to stay the current path and we\u2019ll have a full pension, a \u2154 paid off house, and likely around a million in investments. We\u2019ll have won at age 50.\n\n**-Family**\n\nFortunately, everyone is happy and healthy. Our oldest son is speech delayed and qualified for services through our local district, resulting in free childcare 4 days a week, 3 hours each day. It\u2019s only been a few weeks and he\u2019s already emerging in an incredible way. SO is happy in her role and with her new school, I\u2019m content enough with my own work (though always fishing for new opportunities\u2026SO says I can\u2019t stay still).\n\n**Real Estate Business Summary**\n\nThis was a big change from previous years. Following the medical scare that I mentioned in post #5, we decided to move closer to family and simplify our lives. Our long term tenant, who\u2019d actually lived in his side of the duplex for nearly 5 years, was actively pursuing a home purchase but was frustrated at prices (this was during the rapid escalation of prices when there were 20+ offers within 24 hours) and impatient sellers not taking their offers. We did our own comps and approached them with an offer that had us splitting the savings of not using a realtor, as well as a haircut on the price due to the relationship we\u2019d built with them as neighbors. They accepted, we legally split the duplex, and sold the property for $175,000. They immediately added a room and, knowing our intent to move, let us know that their contractor wanted to purchase our side. We then sold the half we were living in for $185,000 two months after that without a realtor. To summarize, we purchased the duplex for $270,000 in 2020, received $1325 in rent to our $1,690 mortgage, and ended up selling for all in $360,000. In both cases the buyers covered all fees (including those associated with splitting the property) and we were without a realtor.\n\nAs you can imagine, we had a fair bit of proceeds from these transactions. We had to pull some investments to be competitive in the housing market we were entering and ended up putting $100,000 into a down payment for a primary residence (purchased at $450k). We also couldn\u2019t find a house anywhere close to SO\u2019s new job and they now have a 25-30 minute commute. Given how supportive SO was with my desire to use our assets to invest in real estate, their new long commute, and just wanting to do something nice with the cash coming in, we purchased a new 2022 Hybrid Camry to replace our 10 year old civic. Nothing was wrong with the old car, we just wanted better gas mileage, a more comfy and safer ride, and tbh something nicer, and the market at the time favored new cars over used. That purchase gave us a fancy two-vehicle fleet, her 2022 camry and my 2022 Sienna (aka, the spaceship). I also used the proceeds to buy a nice guitar for myself and the remaining went to cash reserves and towards finishing the basement of the new house (my new office\/guitar space).\n\n**Numbers**\n\nNetworth - $242,873.40\n\nInvestments - $116,514.72 (mix of 403b, Roth and Traditional IRA, and pension)\n\nHome Equity - $102,325.07\n\nCash - $24,295.18\n\nDebt - ($261.57) (current balance across all credit card accounts)\n\nMy spreadsheet calculates our ROI from the date we first invested (March of 2017) and still shows a positive overall return (\\~25% cumulative, or 4.21% annual average). This has been a nice metric to look at when the market is down this far and I strongly recommend it for anyone feeling gut-punched in the current market.  \n\n**Final Thoughts\/Reflections**\n\nIf we weren\u2019t there before, the loss of real estate as a side hustle and the prospect of a full pension at 50 has put us well and truly in the *boring* middle. I\u2019m looking forward to gamifying the purchasing of pension credits, but need more info before I can get too deep into planning. Our kids are happy and healthy, we\u2019re closer to family, and we\u2019re comfortable. I\u2019d like to find a role I\u2019m more passionate about, but to be honest I just want to play with my kids, read fantasy books, and play guitar all day, so it\u2019s not a huge priority for me at the moment.. Not a bad life at all and after 2021\u2019s scare, the boring middle is likely just what we need.","upvote_ratio":0.89,"created_utc":1674495815.0},{"title":"Anything else I can do to accelerate the boring middle?","author":"WSBtoFIRE","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/financialindependence\/comments\/10j9lf0\/anything_else_i_can_do_to_accelerate_the_boring\/","text":"34 year old male in middle management accounting.\n\nI started investing as soon as I got a job at 19 and even opened a Roth IRA back then.\n\nCurrently making $135K\/yr (after bonus) and managed to save a good amount in my opinion:\n\nCash: $100K\nTaxable Brokerage: $220K\n401k: $240K\nRoth IRA: $100K\nI-Bonds: $20K (2022 contributions only)\n\nI do max out my 401k (since 2017) and Roth IRA every year.

During one of my \u201cno job, no consulting\u201d periods in the late fall of 2013 (fall is a notoriously hard time to find a new job as everyone is on vacation, spent their budgets, etc.) I fell deep into the bitcoin rabbit hole researching what it was, what it might become etc. I bought in a few times and sold a majority of my holdings in December 2017 (not at the peak, but close) for about 1.5M. I had also saved a shit-ton of money over the years (almost 1M) because I never spent other than buying\/fixing up my house. The FIRE idea was natural to me \u2013 I had an instinctual aversion to debt, simple tastes, and grew up without a lot (but didn\u2019t feel like that was an issue). My job was not really going in a direction I liked, and I had just cashed over a million in post-tax crypto so I quit and never looked back.\n\n**My FIRE Details**  With all my retirement, bank, and stock accounts bundled together, including house equity I had close to 4M when I pulled the trigger. Since retirement my entire portfolio has more than doubled to 9M at the peak (November 2021) but has since dropped to a little over 5M. I outright own my house and truck. I have no debts. \nThat said\u2026 it doesn\u2019t take much to have wild swings in my net worth. For example, the market had a mini rally today and bitcoin rose a bit and all said my assets \u201cappreciated\u201d (I have to put it in quotes, because it\u2019s absurd) by over $150,000. Today.  Compared to yesterday. Yeah.  So how do I sleep when this type of yoyo is possible? Well\u2026you get numb to it, or you learn to live with it (like tides) because otherwise you\u2019ll go batshit. I have talked about the gutpunch of the first time I lost a million dollars in a single month (see above) and it has happened more than once \u2013 it\u2019s actually been 4 times. My net worth in one month also rose over 1M twice, with one time being 1.5M. A couple hundred thousand dollar swings up or down are normal to me now. Part of what helps me sleep is that I have a large part of my nest egg in index funds that I am confident will be fine for the long haul, I own my house and truck, and have no debt. My bitcoin could die and I\u2019d be fine (and I already cashed a chink of that back when I retired, so it\u2019s all gravy from here.) \n\n**Big Changes**\nMy biggest changes in the last year revolve around my connection to my community. I have become very close with several neighbors and have had the opportunity to help them both physically (moving, dump runs, fixing things) and mentally\/spiritually (consoling through a divorce, providing a space to have real talk, and community gatherings.) Selling my rental house last year has simplified my world quite a bit, as I am no longer a landlord in a different city. I focused on rehabilitating my hundred year old current house (water mitigation, mostly) and half of my yearly expenses ($60k) was home improvements. \n\n**New Ideas\/Directions**\nI have taken up welding as a hobby and I\u2019m getting into making art and some structural  metalwork (garden beds, LP shelves, a light fixture). I really love going to scrap yards, putting on my gloves and digging through jagged offcuts for interesting shapes. I love sculpture, assemblage, and the art of making. \n\nI have begun learning python (finally). I spoke pseudocode before, but never was the one writing the whole program or architecting it. My brother is a computer scientist so I can ask him how to think about things. I\u2019m curious to try using ChatGPT as a programming buddy to help me with the stuff I can\u2019t quite overcome. I want to play around with predictive modeling, something I was adjacent to in my old working life but never got to get my hands dirty working on. I like accessing my old knowledge and put it back to work. My brain enjoys the puzzle. \n\nI\u2019m collecting thoughts and stories for a book I might write. I like dive bars and the characters you can meet in them, and I find that a lot of people are more than happy to tell you how they feel about a variety of topics if you just ask and\/or listen. I keep a pen and paper on me at all times. It might happen.\n\nI\u2019m finally got back on the road and did some traveling! Between ailing parents, a sick cat, and Covid bullshit, I was stuck close to home for the most part for 2.5 years. I ended up taking 8 trips total \u2013 3 \u201clocal\u201d (drive to location, couple nights each) and 5 domestic flights. Next year I\u2019m getting back to international exploration. It\u2019s been too long. \n\n**Moneycoaster**\nOnce I got to a certain stable bar of net worth (based on my needs, lifestyle, etc.) the rest of it seems less material. Losing a million or gaining $600k in a month is just information now. It was definitely weird to go from 9M in Nov of 2021 down to just below 5M one year later, but it\u2019s very abstract and distant, so it feels less like something to worry about versus monitor every so often. I look at the market every day, but only for 2 minutes and never with any real depth. Once a month I update my spreadsheet. I have my plan, it is in play, it requires little to no maintenance, and so it is what it is. My lifestyle is comfortable, and I\u2019m never fretting over the drop in net worth \u2013 I have 1M more than when I retired and I haven\u2019t worked in 5 years\u2026 how can I be stressed?!? These numbers are absurd, and I am lucky. To let them interfere with my happiness\/existence would defeat one core purpose of FIRE \u2013 freedom. \n\n**Challenges**\nThe biggest challenges I face are caring for aging parents (one from afar). One is quite independent, but I want to keep an eye on them in case things change and the other is not independent at all and as of a few months ago  is in a memory care facility. They are safe and cared for, but still need to be advocated for and monitored. It\u2019s really hard to watch a loved elder revert to an infantilistic state. Fun fact \u2013 people with dementia can become kleptos! They told me not to leave anything valuable there because people will wander into each other\u2019s rooms and \u201ccollect\u201d things they find shiny or meaningful (one woman is notorious for taking religious iconography). It\u2019s hilarious in many ways. \n\n\nI\u2019m still struggling with getting enough exercise and I just haven\u2019t made the mental leap needed to get me in some pattern that works for me. I\u2019m not massively overweight, but I could stand to drop 15 pounds. I did make two changes last year \u2013 I stopped eating breakfast (so I basically am on an IF from 10pm to noon) and I took up running (for a while, until I twisted my ankle playing with nephews). I have a love\/hate relationship with running so I might stick it out, or not. When I\u2019m running (was at 3x a week) doing a 2 mile loop (was about to up it to 3 when ankle got twisted), I\u2019m feeling my body and experiencing it change (like how I can run a whole mile with no slowdown\u2026that was not true at first) and I really like that. But there\u2019s something in me that resists putting on the shoes, and keeping the schedule. I probably need to join a damn running club (or make one). Shit. \n\n**Closing**\nI\u2019m really enjoying this lifestyle. I wake up and make coffee, read news (on the porch in nice weather), work in the workshop, ride my bike, walk around my hood, always have time for neighbors in need, work on the house, cook, listen to music, research new skills, read, plan and take trips, and generally enjoy a mellow pace of life. I am never bored. Ever. There is so much to do, and so much to see, I\u2019ll be fine. I\u2019m at this place where the numbers are\u2026just numbers. I hope this post is interesting, inspiring(?), and maybe gives you an idea about what it means to drop out of it all. \n\nOne interesting change for me this year is I am admitting to others that I am retired. I wasn\u2019t ready to say it in the past. I\u2019d always keep it vague. Now I just say it. The response has been overwhelmingly positive. \u201cGood for you!!\u201d etc. I\u2019ve also had people ask me about the basics of saving for retirement so I can help them get on a good track (maybe not FIRE, but at least retirement savings!)\n\nI\u2019m happy to answer any (reasonable) questions.

Overall this was about a \\~21% raise to do the exact same job, which was quite shocking.\n\nThis is now my 3rd year at the company (4 total years work experience) and I'm coming up on yearly raise time again which I only expect to be around 3%. Unless they make further adjustments for current inflation, which they should, but probably won't. In the next couple of months I also fully vest at the 3 year mark, which is about $20k from their match that I already include in my net worth below. I also receive my yearly bonus at the same time. They have me in handcuffs for a few months to say the least.\n\n**Current market conditions:**\n\nThought I should at least talk about this briefly. With the market taking a downward turn since my last post 2 years ago, I still continue(d) to max everything and changed nothing about the way I spend or invest in any way. As a result, even continuing to pump money in every month, my net worth stayed completely the same for about 1 of the last 2 years. Only recently did my net worth start to bump upwards more again, even like I said, while continuing to max everything out contributing monthly. I invest everything into VTSAX or similar low cost index funds that blend small\/mid\/large cap. I will never change my investment patterns. I will also never change my spending patterns unless I truly hit financial hardship.\n\n**The future?:**\n\nIn my last update 2 years ago, I said I was considering a job hop that year or the next. It has been 2 years since then and I am still in the same job and still not looking elsewhere. Why?\n\n1. Well first, because the 21% promotion was very unexpected and quite unprecedented. I shouldn't have gotten a promotion that early, and even if so, the promotion would usually be around 10%. I am not loyal to any company, but that was respectful and earned more time out of me.\n2. Second, I quite frankly barely ever have to work. I work remotely, and if I'm being completely honest, I work maybe 5 hours per week the average week. The irony is that my work is highly praised and appreciated and I often receive top 5th percentile employee performance in my quarterly reviews.\n\nLike my last post, my dream job is still to get into a tier 1 job such as google, facebook, amazon, netflix, apple. I have a new requirement that I want to stay 100% remote forever. Having said this, I have a newly found internal struggle: *is the increased pay worth having to work so much more?* I currently work 5 hours per week to bring home $126k in a LCOL area. Does getting a 20%, 50%, 100% pay increase make it worth it to have to work 40-60 hours per week and lose this extra freetime and happiness that I have? What percentage increase does make it worth it? Is there even a number within reason that I would consider?\n\nI really don't know. My current opinion is: I might stay in this job for as long as I barely have to work. I will continue to get demenial yearly inflation raises and possibly 1-2 more promotions down the road. I really love life right now and don't think I would be anywhere near as happy working much more for more money. Having said that, if I were actually to start being given a large workload, I think I should go have a large workload elsewhere for a lot more money. Regardless, I might also test the waters at some point just to see what those offers look like.\n\n**I am very open to feedback and will be here to answer any questions\/advice you guys have for me.

Time-wise, I spent around 8-12 hrs \/ week churning, in two-player mode (opening accounts for both myself and my wife). We had only expected to make \\~$1K \/ month from churning, so everything over that was a nice surprise.\n\nBit of background - my wife and I leanFIREd in early 2021 with an annual retirement budget of $36K. We both had hobbies we wanted to pursue part-time, which turned our leanFIRE situation into more of a voluntary baristaFIRE... my wife loves being around animals, so she got a funjob at a nearby barn earning min wage. And I've been churning as a hobby since 2010, so kinda just leaned into that.\n\nHere's the breakdown of our churning numbers -\n\n**Cash Breakdown**\n\n|*Category*|*# Churns*|*$ Churns*|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Bank Bonuses|60|$15,390|\n|Brokerages & Crypto Bonuses|20|$6,450|\n|Cellphones|14|$1,260|\n|Credit Cards Bonuses|27|$6,257|\n|Deals \/ Discounts \/ Freebies|35|$1,200|\n|Shopping Portals|24|$1,897|\n|Mealkits|35|See mealkit breakdown|\n|**Total**|**215**|**$32,454**|\n\nWith cash bonuses, particularly bank and brokerage bonuses, they are generally considered taxable. Banks will usually issue a 1099-INT for bank bonuses, and brokerages issue a 1099-B for brokerage bonuses. So we did have to modify our leanFIRE plan a bit, since we originally planned to stay under 200% FPL (for better ACA subsidies) and \"use\" most of that limit towards our Roth conversion ladder.\n\nLuckily, points earned from credit card bonuses are generally not considered taxable. The IRS considers them rebates\/discounts on purchases you made, rather than taxable income. So the 981K points (which are worth roughly $10K if you cash them out at 1 cent per point) are totally tax- free. We usually just save them for free travel, since it's fairly easy to get at least 1.5 cpp that way, making them worth at least $15K.\n\n**Points Breakdown**\n\n|Amex|300,000|\n|:-|:-|\n|Chase|541,000|\n|Southwest|140,000|\n|**Total**|**981,000**|\n\n**Mealkits Breakdown**\n\nNot included in the $ numbers above are the super-discounted dinners we got from various mealkit companies. I wasn't sure how to count those, since it really depends on how much you would typically pay for dinner normally.\n\nBut from the 35 mealkit churns, we had over 175 dinners for two delivered in 2022, from pretty much every mealkit company, including HelloFresh, GreenChef, Sunbasket, Blue Apron, Home Chef, Gobble, Freshly, Daily Harvest, Factor75. By stacking their signup offers with rakuten, swagbucks, ibotta, chase\/amex\/cap1 offers, etc., we were able to get each dinner down to under $5 total for two people.\n\nSo $875 total for dinner for two people for half the year... not bad, especially considering many of the meals were deliciousness enough that we would cook them again ourselves or for friends.\n\nAnyways, those were the main highlights of the year for us, but happy to go into more detail if anyone is interested. As a FIRE strategy, I do think churningFIRE is at least as viable as baristaFIRE for reaching and maintaining early retirement. Hopefully someone found it useful. Happy churning :)","upvote_ratio":0.91,"created_utc":1673971873.0},{"title":"Can anyone recommend a good company for homeowners insurance in Hawaii?","author":"Bikesandkittens","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/financialindependence\/comments\/10ge044\/can_anyone_recommend_a_good_company_for\/","text":"We also need hurricane and earthquake insurance.

A 4% Safe Withdrawal Rate is usually the starting point for people on this sub when starting to think about how much they'll need when they retire, and by 2009 it looked like year-2000 retirees would be one of the few cohorts who wouldn't succeed with a 4% SWR lasting 30 years. So, at the end of each year I like to  look at their performance.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Data**\n\nThis rough analysis looks at the results of  different withdrawal rates under 2 scenarios, 100% invested in S&P 500,  and a 60\/40 split between SP500\/10-YR-Treasuries. It adjusts for inflation,  assumes dividends\/interest are reinvested, and uses fixed withdrawal rates based on the starting portfolio amount (like with the 4% SWR rule).\n\n[Chart](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/CmqVDUw):  For 2000, and the years just before and after, it shows how much of their portfolio would remain on Jan 1, 2023 for various withdrawal rates.\n\n[Graph](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/qOeHOPh):  For people who retired January 1, 2000, it shows how their portfolio value would change over time for various withdrawal rates.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Thoughts**\n\nThe 4% SWR doesn't look like it will make it the standard 30 years with a 100% stock allocation, but with a 60\/40 allocation it is almost certain to last for 30 years. If you have a much longer retirement horizon than 30 years, then you'd want much more of your portfolio remaining at this point, and a withdrawal rate of 2.5-3% would have worked out better with the 60\/40 portfolio. \n\nThere's two reasons I think it's worth looking at this cohort. First, it is a real and recent example of a situation where there were big negative returns early in your retirement period. So it provides a good opportunity to think about how you might handle a similar situation. Second, because it's worth remembering that you are disproportionately likely to voluntarily retire at a bad time. A lot of people were retiring when stocks were reaching all time highs in 1999 and 2000, but very few people were choosing to stop working while their portfolios were dropping in 2001-2003.

My parents helped pay for college, so I graduated with a bachelor's degree debt free.\n* We paid for the last 2 years of my wife's college, taking on some student loans. We paid cash for my masters degree.\n* I am learning to be content and happy with my situation. When I take a step back, I have it made. I have a great job that pays well and I work from home. My spouse is able to stay home with our kid. I have a spacious house and so many other luxuries.\n* We've been a 1 car family since we've been married and saved a lot of money. I was lucky to be able to walk\/bike\/take transit for my commutes until I switched to remote. We started out with a 6k used car that my spouse had just bought, ran it to the ground and then bought a 7k car that was well maintained from a family member.\n* My spouse and I have fought a lot about finances. They grew up somewhat poor and didn't want to continue living as frugal now that they finally had money. I am naturally very frugal. We tried Mint to track stuff, didn't work well. Then we kind of stopped tracking and just tried to spend from a pot of money after bills and savings were accounted for. I like spreadsheets, my spouse never looked at them and I had a hard time giving up control. A few months ago we switched to a hybrid cash envelope system and using a money book that we track everything in. It's been great. My spouse has gotten much more involved and it feels like we are a team and can both see where the money is going and how much we have left to spend. My advice: keep trying until you find a system that works for you.\n* Discovered the FIRE community around 2017 and I soaked up everything I could. I realized the boring middle can hit pretty fast. I have enjoyed all I've learned the last few years and am trying to not focus so much on finances and just live. Invest regularly what you can and simply wait for it to grow.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Thanks for all the kind words. I've been trying to respond to any questions in the comments.

However as soon as we do the conversion from 401k to Roth IRA (doesn't matter if its $1 or $50k) the account gets suspended from making any more contributions to 401k, this includes pre-tax, after tax, or any other way.\n\nThe plan: Front load the 401k pre-tax and after tax, and try to max it before June, do the conversion, then in January repeat the process. The negative is ill probably miss out on \\~$3k of employer match. Small sacrifice to be able to mega.\n\nMy question: How could this effect the ESPP? Since I will be contributing 100% pre-tax and 100% after tax until June, will I not purchase any ESPP until June when I put those to 0%?\n\nThanks and let me know if you have any questions.","upvote_ratio":0.58,"created_utc":1673622525.0},{"title":"Changing jobs for higher pay vs staying and coasting","author":"elongated_smiley","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/financialindependence\/comments\/10af25w\/changing_jobs_for_higher_pay_vs_staying_and\/","text":"Hi FIRE folks,\n\nI (M45) am in a lucky situation today where I have to decide between keeping my current job and accepting a significantly better offer. \n\n-\n\n\n**current role**\n\nIn my *current role* (software company), I'm coasting - I feel semi-retired even though I have a full time job. Realistically I'm working 25 hours a week. This gives me a ton of flexibility to take care of my 3 young kids, as well as handle all those other normal tasks like investing, planning trips, dealing with home repairs, etc. \n\nI work from home 4 days a week on average. I have quite a lot of independence regarding where and when I work. The work is boring, but it pays the bills, and has allowed me to save towards FIRE. My salary at this point is basically capped for my role, so inflationary raises only the last 4 years.\n\n**new role**\n\nThe *new role* (at a much bigger company) comes with a *20% pay raise*, and is a step (or maybe 2) up the corporate ladder. Obviously there are some unknowns, but I have to assume I'd be working the full 37 hours a week and spend 4-5 days a week at the office, at least in the beginning. More oversight and visibility, at least in the beginning. \n\nThe work itself would be rather new for me, and potentially more interesting, allowing me to set the goals and path for a whole department. The potential to climb quickly from this position to another in the company is definitely there. Obviously less time for my kids, and lower work-life balance, although should still be good.\n\n-\n\n**considerations**\n\nI'm on the path to FIRE within 5 years. In other words, I'm not really interested in the long-term career opportunities and climbing the corporate ladder. There just doesn't seem to be any point. At least I haven't been interested in this until now - I have just been pushing towards retirement. But who knows what the future looks like? Maybe I want FIRE because I'm bored at work and this will change things. I doubt that I still want to be working full time in 5 years though.\n\nI feel totally lame turning down a prestigious role that I have not been offered before. What will I even say? \"Yes I know it's a nice job title and more money, but I'm turning this down so I can continue to not do very much\".\n\nThe 20% raise, while nice of course, will not get us to FIRE significantly faster. At this point the gains (and losses) in the market are overshadowing my yearly salary. \n\nAfter an initial ramp-up period, I don't actually *know* that the new role would be any harder than the current role. Maybe I can find a new balance where I'm doing the same amount of work, but this will take time if it's even possible at all.\n\n-\n\nI'm really stuck here, and have to give an answer by the weekend.

Am realizing now, after have returned to the same employer for another 3 years, that I likely need a more extended break (9-12 months), as my mental and physical health have deteriorated further. However, I have a number of concerns about taking such a break, so am hoping to learn from folks' experiences and how they were able to make the most of their time away without letting anxiety about the potential negative impact to career, FI, etc. take over.\n\nUnlike most early-career sabbatical\/gap year takers, my family's expenses are quite high. I live in a VHCOL area, am married (spouse works full-time as well), have a mortgage, and two young children. We've been fortunate though to earn and save enough to make pretty good headway on our path to FI , and have enough reserve to last us a couple years, but I have fears nonetheless. Some questions below: \n\n* **What were others' experiences upon re-entering the job market? Easier \/ harder than expected?** Obviously this will depend a lot on timing (in a recession vs. boom market), and the degree to which one attempts to change professions, so would love to hear how you landed back on your feet after the break.\n* My spouse, fortunately, likes their job and has no desire to take a break anytime soon. Although they have said they would support my taking an extended break, I worry that resentment might bubble up if I come back from a day of leisure, fun, self-discovery, and they come back exhausted from their work day. I can certainly pick up more of the housework and child-care to mitigate this a bit, but it's a concern nonetheless. **How have others in a similar home situation navigated this?**\n* **How did you quiet any anxiety around eating into your savings\/nest egg, especially when FI has been a major goal\/motivator for so long?**\n* **How did you find balance between structure \/ unstructured time during your break?** I'm sure this is highly personal and there's no right or wrong approach here, but curious to hear more as many seem to find the lack of structure difficult to deal with, especially at the start of their break.\n* **Looking back on your sabbatical experience, what would you have done differently?**\n\nI fully recognize that even being in a position to take an extended sabbatical is a luxury; I also suspect that my story is probably not that uncommon in my industry (tech), so am appreciative of any and all insight and wisdom this community has that can help me and others in the same boat gain some perspective.

I'm using a throwaway to not make sure they're not identifiable.\n\nTheir net worth is a hair over 1M. Two incomes, just under 200K or so total. Maxing 401Ks, RIRAs, 529s for state tax deduction, plus some additional savings in brokerage, totalling maybe 80-95K, so about 40-50% savings rate. So they consider themselves near FI, sort of LeanFI now. They don't anticipate retiring for at least four years, and they could imagine working as many as 10 more years. They are in their mid-40s.\n\nLots of current spend is giving and temporary expenses and large discretionary spending. Their essential spending is maybe 36K, including home insurance and taxes (5900\/yr total), but NOT including Principal and Interest.\n\nSo here's the deal. The mortgage P&I is 1400\/mo (16,800\/yr). Rate is 2.5% on 30 years. Refi was Oct 2020, when home appraisal was 460K. They've already paid off some extra, so current balance is 306K, and if they just pay minimums, they pay it off in mid-2046 (4.5 years early).\n\nThey have access to the MHA. (I'm not looking for a discussion of this element of the tax code, of course. I'm just looking to help this family member.)\n\nSo they could write off up to about 71K\/yr in housing expenses (due to the fair market value of their home rented in their market if fully furnished). So that's the 5900 for taxes and insurance and the 16800 for P&I, so 22700.\n\nAnd then they could write off additional principal paydown up to about 48K\/yr. They are in the 22% bracket, so the additional tax savings would be about 10K. A guaranteed 22% return is attractive, but it's one time, and then those funds are sitting in their home equity, not working for them.\n\nPaying off the house within the MHA would forego earnings if they paid the minimum and invested it for the life of the loan. Just paying the minimum and paying tax on the income would leave them with 48K - 10K = 38K to invest for the next 23.5 years. (Of course, each year passing means another 38K or so invested, but also fewer years to have it invested...)\n\n38K invested, assuming 2.5% cost of capital (because that's what they're paying in interest annually on it), and an assumed real return of 5%, e.g., means a return of 2.5% after inflation and after factoring in the mortgage. In 23.5 years, that'd be 68K in today's dollars. Of course, there's risk to this, and only working from estimates.\n\nI generally am in the \"don't pay off such a low rate mortgage, just invest and enjoy the liquidity and returns\" camp. But with the guaranteed tax savings, I'm wondering second-guessing that approach...\n\nAm I thinking of this rightly? Anything I'm missing? How would you advise them? Or what questions would you ask them?\n\nAnd if you'd prefer to reply privately via chat or message, please do!\n\n(Mods, in my searching, I wasn't able to find anything on the MHA, so I thought this might warrant a top-level post.)","upvote_ratio":0.28,"created_utc":1673278322.0},{"title":"Asking for Opinions on Housing Payments versus Investments","author":"Erik_Lassiter","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/financialindependence\/comments\/107fszm\/asking_for_opinions_on_housing_payments_versus\/","text":"Reddit Friends,   \n\n\nI am getting close to paying off debts and looking at next steps.  I am currently paying off a significant debt on a credit card.  Long story, but I was in a crunch last year and ran up about $10k on a credit card.  I now have it down to about $4k and expect to have it paid in full in the next three months.   \n\n\nOnce I have it paid off, I intend to pay off a debt of $9k.  I had a metal roof installed on my house and financed by the installer.  It was originally around $13k.  I now have it down to $9k @ 7.99% interest. The monthly payment is $130, but I'm paying for $420\/month (because it amuses me to pay that amount).  My intention is that once the credit card is paid off, I'll raise the roof payment to $666 (because it will amuse me further to pay that amount.) Doing that should have that loan paid in full in about a year and a half.  So ... this is long term planning, I acknowledge.   \n\n\nSo come mid 2024 or 2025 I will be completely debt free, no personal loans, no credit card debt, etc.  I will only have my mortgages.   \n\n\nI currently max out my personal ROTH contributions each year, invest an additional $200\/month into a brokerage account, and invest 3% of my salary (with an employer match of 7%) for 10% of salary going into my 401k.  Once my debts are paid off, I will have about an additional $1k month for further debt reduction or investing.    \n\n\nI am thinking of the following strategies:  \n\n\n* I own two houses.  One a duplex.  I live in one side, rent the other side out.  My tenant's rent is roughly about the same as the mortgage.  Because I am making additional payments towards this mortgage, it should be paid off in 6 years.  The balance is around $50k @ 3% interest. Since I've had this loan for about 6 years, currently each month's payment has the amount going to principal at about twice the amount going to interest.  \n\n*  The second home I own is a 3 BR, currently rented for about the same amount as the mortgage.  Currently balance on that one is $215k @ 5% interest. The mortgage is only about a year old, so currently each month's payment has the amount going to  interest is about three times the amount going to principal. \n\nI am over 50, so I am eligible to make \"catch up\" contributions to my employer's 401k plan.   \n\n\nWhat strategies would you guys recommend I pursue with the additional money I will have each month?  Should I simply put it all into my employer's 401k plan as \"catch up payments\"?  Look at paying off my duplex? This is my personal leaning. The idea of owning a completely paid off home is very appealing, but... the loan is only 3%.  Should I start making double or triple payments on my house since it's really early in the loan and it's a 5% rate ? And my duplex will be paid off in 5 or 6 years anyway?  \n\n\nWhat are y'all's thoughts?

When I was much younger, I saved much more heavily as I hated my job and felt directionless. As the years have passed, it's become less important to me; I don't really see myself retiring early any longer, but I do still want to be FI enough that I could stop working for a couple years or move to a start-up. FIRE has always been more of my goal, rather than my husband's. However, he is supportive. He does not see himself retiring early.\n\n**Current Income - \\~$250K** (using lower estimate of stocks)\n\n* My income: 137K + 15% bonus + $30-$50K RSUs\n* Spouse income: $55K, increasing to $70K\n* $300 profit\/month from a $200K rental property ($100K left on mortgage)\n\n**Net Worth - \\~690K** (not counting equity in rental property)\n\n* Regular Mutual Fund + vested RSUs : $160K + $55K = $215K\n* Roth IRA: $130K\n* 401K: $230K\n* HSA: $25K\n* Regular Savings Accounts (Emergency, House Fund, Travel Fund): $90K\n\n**Large Outflows**\n\n* We generally try to put away $4500\/month in any savings source (whether mutual fund or 401K).\n   * Edit: We don't touch my RSUs either. We sell those regularly and move them into VTSAX.\n* $3500 rent\/month (we live in the middle of a high COL city)\n* Planning for infant daycare in the next year\n\n\\-----\n\nWe will be in this high COL city for another couple years and aren't ready to move to a cheaper part of town. We are planning to have kids this year. Daycare for an infant costs $3600\/month where we live; though I will also have 6 months maternity leave, so hopefully we can minimize the infant costs with daycare. Since I'm not even pregnant, we have at least another 1.5 years of savings before we'll need to pay for infant daycare. However, we are planning to ease back on our savings rate this year so that we can \"live it up\" more as a DINK.\n\nEventually, we hope to move to a lower COL city, but that's highly dependent on our jobs. Regardless, we won't live in the center of town for more than a few more years. When we do move in a few years, we have a vague plan to buy a house. I'm hoping that our current accessible savings (from savings account + regular mutual fund) is enough for a deposit at that time. We don't plan to be saving much while paying for daycare; possibly we'll only aim to max my 401K as I get a 50% match (and I do realize that maxing out my 401K is still quite a large amount of savings in general. It's just much less than what we do now. I hope to be able to do this, but I'm not counting on it. It seems silly to leave a 50% match on the table though).\n\nI have a few questions.\n\n* Are we Coast FIRE?\n   * I'm confused as to what I should put in the \"Annual Spending in Retirement\" bucket, as I don't know what $30K\/$50K would mean in 30 more years.\n      * I also see that the median price for a nursing home is $7K. Are we supposed to plan for $14K\/month in expenses by the time we retire? That seem inordinate and not what most people can do.\n   * Same with current invested assets: I think we're coast fire if we take everything into account, but should we only count the retirement accounts (401K, HSA, IRA)? Considering we'll probably be taking a big chunk out of our mutual funds to buy a house in a couple years, I feel like I should not count the nonretirement savings (but at the same time, we'll still have at least 2 more years of savings until then).\n* Is it okay to not really plan to save while paying for infant daycare?\n   * I'm hoping that our base is large enough that not saving for a couple years won't make a big dent.\n* Any other feedback on our plan? Any things we should take into consideration as we continue to save for a house and plan for kids (and still aim for FI)?\n\nThank you for the help!\n\nEdit: Another clarification, the 8.5 years in my title is how long we've been working.","upvote_ratio":0.64,"created_utc":1673057789.0},{"title":"How do you protect yourself against future potential policy changes that would affect your retirement account withdrawals in early retirement?","author":"MapaRaccoon","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/financialindependence\/comments\/104tqno\/how_do_you_protect_yourself_against_future\/","text":"I've done some looking around and it seems that politicians have tried several times in the recent past to pass legislation that would make the Roth conversion ladder impossible to do.

This and travel are my primary indulgences\n4. 10% or 7k Travel\n5: 9% or 6k Wedding\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nIn March of this year, my parents gave me a few days notice before effectively dropping my youngest brother on my doorstep. This required my partner and I to move to and furnish a very expensive place in San Diego, CA on less than a week of notice. The ensuing legal battle also resulted in hefty lawyer fees and we had to cancel a honeymoon trip to Dublin. Once the dust settled and I no longer had my brother, we had to move again. All in, it cost $14k not counting the hidden costs of a HCOL for those few months, a second move, etc. My partner did not contribute to related expenses, including rent for the 3 months we were were in San Diego. Any quantities my parents reimbursed were subtracted from all calculations. From a financial standpoint, I don't recommend being the eldest child in a family with shit parents.\n\nI got married in September! The wedding was perfect for us and cost 12k. My husband and I split the total, although I've loaned him 6k which I am expecting to see next year. This is why my liquid savings are still so low; I've been covering housing. We are maintaining separate finances since we have very different financial habits and goals. My new in-laws covered our honeymoon hotel as a gift, which was awesome, and we received $600 in monetary gifts. Most of the expenses were because we paid for food, lodging, and plane tickets where applicable for all 10 of our guests.\n\nI absolutely would not have been able to do any of that without my income, and it's a miracle I handled so much unexpected spend and still came out on top for the year. I didn't keep to my budget at all, but was in survival mode for a while and just throwing money at problems until they went away. I was working a high-stress full time consulting job, a part time restaurant job, and being a 24\/7 caretaker to a very mentally ill teenager (not to mention planning a wedding.) This ultimately resulted in a minor breakdown and \\~2 months on short term disability, which negatively impacted my income but  allowed me to keep my consulting job (although I did quit a side gig making ramen.)\n\nMy financial goals last year were to pursue more side gigs and contribute more to my husband's student loans. I made 1.8k in side income, and I didn't contribute to his student loans at all but did loan him a significant amount. I'd consider these both successes, especially considering the circumstances. My financial goals for next year are to grow a 15k emergency fund (currently 0), be within budget at least 8 of 12 months, and max out all retirement accounts including my HSA.","upvote_ratio":0.81,"created_utc":1672952441.0},{"title":"way to legitimately earn money online?","author":"MWeeso","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/financialindependence\/comments\/105ppmb\/way_to_legitimately_earn_money_online\/","text":" I'm a college student , i can write stories , scientific articles , do  photo editing and Photoshop designs and i desperately need a way to earn  money online I've tried everything ,  every freelancing platform but  with no luck on getting a project :\/ i can work for as low as 2$\/hr can  somebody walk me through first steps of making money online ?","upvote_ratio":0.2,"created_utc":1673100107.0},{"title":"FI Update: 2L in Law School living in VHCOL City while pursuing non-corporate job","author":"mrpotatoe3044","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/financialindependence\/comments\/10492nu\/fi_update_2l_in_law_school_living_in_vhcol_city\/","text":"Hi Everyone!  27M married to a 26F living in a VHCOL city FIRE update. I don't think I've ever done a FI update post before, but pre law school I would every couple of months in the daily threads. I figured I would make my (first) post here for tracking! I don't do a super diligent job tracking my expenses so I will ballpark as much as possible. \n\nI'm currently a 2L in law school hoping to work in public interest after graduating (such as at a Public Defender's Office or Legal Aid, pay should be around 70K). Before law school I worked in biotech, and very fortunately, my company got acquired by a large pharmaceutical and all of my options got exercised on top of 6 months of severance (when I was quitting anyways for law school LOL, such bizarrely good luck) which netted me a total of \\~150K after taxes, which is really the main reason why we have so many assets (relatively speaking) for our age. \n\n**Income: 134K** \n\nWife: 67K in the nonprofit field that is almost entirely WFH. She actually got promoted at the beginning of last year for a couple grand raise. She likes it there a lot, but they are based in a different state, so the health insurance costs quite a bit (\\~$450 per month). \n\nMe: Also 67K (57K from independently tutoring about 10-20hours per week, 10K school stipend for my summer internship). \n\n**Worth (295K) (Cash\/bonds: 48K) (Stock: 247K)**\n\nUn-allocated Cash: 10K in her checking account, 10K in mine, and then 10K in our E-fund \n\nAllocated Cash: 8K for a 2025 wedding (we had a legal wedding back in the day at the town hall but wanted to wait to save $$ for a real one). Aiming to save up about another 8K. \n\nI-Bonds: 10K \n\nRoth IRAs: 30K in mine, 18K in hers. \n\n401K: 34K in mine, 18K in hers \n\nJoint brokerage 147K (down a good 15K despite throwing in money at it OOF). \n\n\\*Our stocks are almost entirely VTSAX. \n\n**Debt:**\n\n100K in student loans (all me LOL) \n\n**Expenses: ($3,645 per mo)**\n\nI really don't track expenses but we are relatively frugal. We tend to spend a bit more around finals as I get too busy to cook and it's not really fair on the wife to front that burden. Here is my best guestimate. We also have some random expenses, like travel for us to visit home (she's not American). We also help pay for her family's air fare to come over and such. \n\nRent: $1950 per month\n\nHealth Insurance (via spouse): $450 per month \n\nPhone: $100 per month \n\nInternet: $100 per month\n\nFood: $500 per month (groceries here are so expensive!!) \n\nGoing out to eat: \\~$350 per month\n\nSubway: variable since I bike when it's nice, but probably $120 per month \n\nDog Expenses: $75 per month \n\n**Thoughts**\n\nWere definitely pretty cash heavy. Going into Law School I was a little unsure of how well I could balance working with law school but the tutoring is pretty minimal, I can set it to my schedule, and has been surprisingly consistent. I've gotten pretty decent grades so far too, so I feel like it is still sustainable. I would invest it, but I think at this point we'll likely be putting some to the side for a down payment for a house, which would ideally be in about 4-5 years depending on if my wife decides grad school. We'd likely use most of our brokerage plus another chunk of cash. \n\nI'm not concerned about my law school debt. The school I chose has some of the best debt forgiveness (LRAP) for lawyers, which was one of the major deciding factors, so I will be relying on that to pay most of my loans. (The way it works is they pay my entire student loan payment until I start to earn >110K total, so after graduating I will supplement my attorney pay with tutoring right up until the 110 mark). \n\nThe \"sirens call\" of corporate big law does still occasionally seem appealing (I think they start at like 210K base nowadays) but it's really not the reason I went to law school and I have no interest in that field. I'm also at the point where I've only done internships for direct-client service organizations so this would be a somewhat difficult pivot anyways - for the best. \n\nMoving forward we will continue to max out our Roths, and then focus on our more short term goals (wedding\/down deposit). I don't regret going to law school and I have really enjoyed the (small amount) of work I've been able to do via internships\/externships. My attorney salary is going to be less than what I made as an associate scientist in biotech, at least at first, but I still feel like it was the right move to make. I feel like this sub can sometimes discourage \"passion\" fields, but I suppose I shouldn't be speaking too forwardly as I have only interned. I also feel really grateful for the luck I've had, especially as I grew up in a very low income household\/rural state.","upvote_ratio":0.68,"created_utc":1672950206.0},{"title":"How much did you spend on your car?","author":"leevs11","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/financialindependence\/comments\/105cv40\/how_much_did_you_spend_on_your_car\/","text":"How much as a % of your income or % of net worth did you spend on your car?","upvote_ratio":0.4,"created_utc":1673057368.0},{"title":"How will blockchain help protect investments in cryptocurrency in 2023?","author":"Mark88902505","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/financialindependence\/comments\/105oh1v\/how_will_blockchain_help_protect_investments_in\/","text":"How will blockchain help protect investments in cryptocurrency in 2023?","upvote_ratio":0.1,"created_utc":1673096354.0},{"title":"Next Steps for Achieving FI","author":"brilockojawns","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/financialindependence\/comments\/105hb8u\/next_steps_for_achieving_fi\/","text":"I have roughly $75k saved not including $50k worth of ETF, mutual funds, and other related investments.

However, in Philly I'll pay more income tax (1% suburb vs 3.87% Philly). I have to catch only 1 bus (1 hour long) from the Philly apartment and the place is extremely nice (furnished, gym access, very new, safe walking at night, right next to bus I'll use to commute) and a easier commute to NY where my partner lives.

Many people are planning on SWRs below 4%, even below 3% for early retirees.  However, I read [this article](https:\/\/www.advisorperspectives.com\/articles\/2022\/10\/24\/the-4-rule-just-became-a-whole-lot-easier) where the author created a bond ladder with TIPS to achieve a 4.36% real (inflation adjusted) withdrawal rate for 30 years (the same period as the original Trinity study). There is no catch, this is as close to guaranteed income as you can get, only a US government default or currency crisis would threaten your plan.  \n\nFor a typical investor retiring at 65 and looking for 30 years of portfolio withdrawals, this would be an excellent strategy for a portion of their portfolio.  However, because this portfolio exhausts the investor's initial capital, it likely is not sufficient for the early retiree, who will need income beyond the 30 year time horizon.  \n\nThis situation can be easily handled by setting aside a portion of the portfolio in equities, which will remain untouched for the duration of the bond ladder in order to get capital appreciation.  At the end of the 30 year period, the early retiree can begin to draw down the equity portion of their portfolio in the manner of their choosing, by creating a new bond ladder, variable withdrawal rate drawdown, or purchasing an single premium immediate annuity among other options.\n\nFor example, an early retiree with a $40,000 spending budget requirement could purchase $1,000,000 TIPS ladder which would generate $43,600 inflation adjusted returns for the first 30 years of retirement.  They would also invest $250,000 in equities, which would yield $1,080,000 in 30 years in 2023 dollars, assuming a 5% real return.  Once the ladder is exhausted, the early retiree could begin to draw down the $1 Million equity portfolio.  This works out to be about 3.5% withdrawal rate over 60 years.","upvote_ratio":0.73,"created_utc":1672785595.0},{"title":"Low-Mod January Community Enhancement Event","author":"CripzyChiken","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/financialindependence\/comments\/1027s0v\/lowmod_january_community_enhancement_event\/","text":"EDIT: Incremental Update #1 has happened! See below for details.\n\nHello r\/FI community and Happy New Years! \n\nA recurrent topic in the subreddit is the degree of moderation - whether it is over-moderated, under-moderated, or just right. This discussion has come up to a greater extent over the last few months with [the recent addition of our newest batch of moderators](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/financialindependence\/comments\/xxy87e\/welcoming_our_new_additions_to_the_moderation_team\/). We\u2019ve been working to try and let more discussion topics through and give the home page more activity - but many in the community still feel it isn\u2019t enough, still acting as gatekeepers to people looking for a new view on their finances and life.\n\nThis is a great corner of the internet where discussion can take place without being sidelined by politics or incivility - and that will never change as long as we are moderators - but much of the rest is potentially open for debate. Some of the criticisms we have received have been regarding the fact the subreddit isn\u2019t as newbie friendly as it could be, that we require too much effort to start a top level post, and that this harms engagement. \n\nHonestly - we see some of the points, and have decided to run a bit of an experiment to start off the new year. For the next four weeks, we are proud to announce: \n\n# Low-Mod January Community Enhancement Event!!!! \n*^fireworks, ^cheers ^and ^applause*\n\nFor the entire month of January, the mod team will only enforce [Rules 2, 3 and 7](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/financialindependence\/wiki\/rules). For those who (for some reason) haven't memorized them (or clicked the link) - 2 is no spam, advertising or promotion, 3 is be civil, and 7 is no gender, politics or circle-jerks.\n\nWhy only those - these are the hallmark of the mature and respectful community we have here, and something that no one on the mod team wanted to subject our community to a removal of. Additionally, they are more behavioral rules rather than 'topic' or 'idea' type rules. We still want - and expect - mature discussion here, and these are not things we will bend on.\n\n**So what does this mean, really?** \n\nThe mod team will not be removing stuff that breaks the other rules of our community. Additionally, we won't be pushing or directing people to use the daily or weekly threads.\n\nThis means that basic questions, surveys, feedback requests, and just general finance topics will be temporarily allowed. Additionally, we have increased the number of reports needed for an auto-remove (so spam can still be hit, but normal posts are unlikely to reach the new threshold before a mod sees it), and have greatly lowed the karma threshold to allow more new\/throwaway type accounts to post. \n\nBasically, treat this community as you do the rest of the reddit. Post where and what you think best fits the theme and feel of the community.\n\n**What does this not mean?**\n\nThe mod team is not disappearing. We are still going to be around. We are still going to be removing stuff that doesn't follow rules 2, 3 or 7. We will still be banning people for breaking those rules, this isn't a free pass to act like a child. Bad actors will still be dealt with appropriately.\n\n**So no more daily thread?**\n\nActually, the daily and weekly threads are going to stay as well. A good amount of the community likes the discussion and sense of community of these threads, so we are leaving them. Maybe discussion will continue, maybe not. We honestly have no idea. We want to give everyone as many ways to enjoy this sub as you want.\n\n**And at the end???**\n\nHonestly - we don't know yet. **We will go back to the normal rules on Feb 1**. The mod team has committed to having on going discussion between now and the end of the month about how stuff is going. Depending on those discussions, and how the community reacts to the month in general, we will determine the path forward. \n\nIt's likely that we'll do some sort of survey\/feedback gathering in early Feb as well, to ensure that everyone has a say. Additionally, we will likely pin this thread a couple of times throughout the month as a way to centralize feedback on how stuff is going. \n\n\nAnd that's the plan. Let us know thoughts below, both now and during the 'community enhancement event'.\n\n- \/FI Mod Team\n\nEdit:\n\nIncremental Update #1. \n\nStarting January 9th, we have reinstituted the karma requirement for new top level posts. However, we have greatly lowered the threshold (was 50, not publicly sharing the new number though) and changed it to **subreddit karma**. \n\nReasoning for this change: We've had less than 10% of the posts from the last week garner any decent amount of discussion. One thing that came up a lot was low effort questions, commonly from users that do not have any other history of posting within our community. The mods' thought is that by adding a low level subreddit karma filter, then it will catch a lot of the low effort posts that are easily answered in the FAQ\/wiki\/google. Any sort of other engagement in this community will give enough karma to clear the check, still leaving open the ability for more posts from community members.\n\nThere is still the old standard of \"ask the mods to be approved outside of the karma filter\" which is useful for stuff like new and throwaway accounts. Those requests will be reviewed in the same manner we are treating the rest of the posts for this month.\n\nNo other updates to how we are treating moderation practices at this time.\n\nAs always, please let us know your thoughts, feedback and anything else you'd like us to know.\n\nThanks!","upvote_ratio":0.88,"created_utc":1672751262.0},{"title":"Treasury bills, bonds, Money Market etc; and taxes, am i exempt from all?","author":"xboxhaxorz","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/financialindependence\/comments\/103sook\/treasury_bills_bonds_money_market_etc_and_taxes\/","text":"I am retired through Veteran and SS disability payments all of which is tax free, i do not have a paid job\n\nI dont file taxes with the IRS as they said i dont have to\n\nI am not too familiar with Money Market or Treasury bills but sites say that some are exempt from local and state while others are not, does that matter for me if they are not exempt?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCurrently I have about $30k worth of I Bonds and the rest is at Bask Bank with a 4% HYSA, i prob get between $4 and $8k  worth of interest annually through HYSA, credit card and bank offers\n\nI am living in a Mexican border town Tijuana, if that matters at all\n\nThanks","upvote_ratio":0.17,"created_utc":1672903175.0},{"title":"Lessons Learned After Reaching $1M NW (as a couple)","author":"TheHumblePiggy","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/financialindependence\/comments\/101r88j\/lessons_learned_after_reaching_1m_nw_as_a_couple\/","text":"It\u2019s that time of year again and I\u2019m back to give you an annual update.\n\nI\u2019ve missed you all and hope you\u2019ve achieved some financial wins in 2022.\n\nHere\u2019s a list of my previous posts for those who are interested:\n\nhttps:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/financialindependence\/comments\/emwhuo\/27_black_female_raised_in_hood_just_crossed_100k\/\n\nhttps:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/financialindependence\/comments\/n4tbll\/you_may_snatch_my_job_from_under_my_feet_but\/\n\nhttps:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/financialindependence\/comments\/rv6r2c\/reflections_of_a_black_woman_reaching_50_fi_in_55\/\n\nLet\u2019s jump into the numbers.\n\nMine - 401k: $214k \/\/ Ind.

Brok: $304k \/\/ Roth IRA: $32k \/\/ Checking: $21k \/\/ HSA: $10k = $559k\n\nTotal Combined NW: $1.03M\n\nIn 2022, I invested $122k and my fianc\u00e9 invested ~100k. So let\u2019s just say we invested over $200k combined.\n\nI am 30 years old, work in marketing, and now earn $291k total comp ($200k base, $82k cash bonus, $9k company stock). My fianc\u00e9 is 34 and earns $260k per year. We split expenses 50\/50, don\u2019t own a house or a car, and don\u2019t want kids.\n\nWe initially reached millionaire status over the summer and celebrated by drinking a cheap bottle of wine. We were on cloud nine for about a week and then returned to our baseline level of happiness. In terms of our RE number, we still haven\u2019t landed on a number we can both agree on. He still wants to aim for $10M to help ease the feeling of uncertainty during market fluctuations. For instance, if the market drops 50%, we wouldn\u2019t have to change our lifestyle. But I would argue we could achieve the same between a $3M-$5M NW. We anticipate spending up to $120k\/year in retirement (this includes healthcare and increased vacation spend) so at a min we\u2019d need $3M to live an upgraded version of our current lifestyle. I simply don\u2019t want to work longer than I need to. At the end of the day, I think this is a good problem to have. I know we\u2019ll eventually reach a compromise.\n\nFrom a career standpoint, you may have noticed that I switched jobs. Well, I finally made it to big tech and negotiated hard for my compensation package. The job\u2019s fine. Not as exciting as my last role, but I\u2019m learning some interesting things. One of my goals was to work at a tech company. Now that I've achieved it, I\u2019m not sure what I want to do next with my career. As our NW grows, I no longer care about moving up the corporate ladder. I\u2019ve been more interested in my creative hobbies, travel planning, and things we can start doing now before reaching FI (e.g., videography, photography, more exercise, more travel). I guess I sense our corporate careers are nearing an end as we get closer to FI. I'm slowing down on the corporate hamster wheel and I don\u2019t hate it.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, I\u2019m newly engaged and can\u2019t wait to marry the love of my life. We don\u2019t care much for jewelry so I asked for a cheaper gem instead of a diamond ring. He wants a rubber ring. Our thinking is that if we lose them, they can easily be replaced without breaking the bank. Also, the thought of my fianc\u00e9 spending thousands on a ring makes me feel queasy so we agreed to spend more on our honeymoon. We haven\u2019t picked a date yet, but plan to marry in 2024. We may have a small dinner party (no wedding) after we elope with no more than 20 relatives. Once we leave corporate America, we plan to slow travel around the world while pursuing our hobbies in more depth.\n\nNo one in our family knows about our millionaire status. They know that we invest and are pursuing financial independence, but no one has expressed particular interest in it.\n\nThings are still stable on the mental front. I\u2019ve reached a point where I couldn\u2019t care less if I get laid off. I have no doubt that I will be able to find another job eventually. Who knows, maybe I\u2019ll double down on one of my hobbies instead and see where that takes me. This mindset makes me feel incredibly powerful as if we\u2019ve already reached FI.\n\nI\u2019m still cycling indoors 3-4x per week and lifting weights 2x per week. I plan to continue doing this, if not more, in retirement.\n\nWhile no one knows what the future holds, I expect there to be some form of a recession coming (or maybe we\u2019re already in one?). I may get laid off and that would be totally fine because I have enough invested\/saved to weather the storm for multiple years and have full confidence in my ability to eventually find another job. It also helps having a partner who works too.\n\nAnyway, here are some lessons we\u2019ve learned that you may want to keep in mind and\/or apply to your FI journey:\n\n\u2022 Celebrate every NW milestone. You\u2019ve earned it\n\n\u2022 Your past does not define your future\n\n\u2022 The closer you get to FI, the less f*cks you\u2019ll give\n\n\u2022 Explore hobbies and practice healthy habits before reaching FI (ideally 2-3 years beforehand)\n\nRemember, none our progress happened overnight. It took a lot of luck and consistency to help us reach this point. However, I would be remiss if I didn\u2019t acknowledge the privilege we now have at this age. That\u2019s not lost on us and we (especially myself) are learning how to navigate that.\n\nUntil next time\u2026","upvote_ratio":0.85,"created_utc":1672701878.0},{"title":"Need Help on Being 1099","author":"Rare_Entrepreneur_78","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/financialindependence\/comments\/103rjj9\/need_help_on_being_1099\/","text":"So I started up my first 1099 self-contractor job in late March.

Might as well take advantage of high interest rates now with a high-yield savings account, then when the mortgage market is looking better in a few years, make the purchase myself. Anyone have any thoughts or advice? \n\nAddendum\u2014 I am working now but planning on going to law school so I won\u2019t have the same paycheck for a few years. Trying to factor this into my investment plan. I know inflation is high but those fees on the 403b make me very very suspicious, and I think saving in a high yield savings would preserve the value of my money better than a 403b.

I have 400,000 left in the loan. I'm 34 and earning around $135,000 pre-tax. I have been prioritizing putting money in taxed investment accounts and Roth IRA until I bought the house.

My expenses is pretty low but I do like to travel and spend extra money on things that I deemed meaningful such as cooking fresh food for my dogs. \n\nAfter counting the $2,600 monthly mortgage payment, living expenses, and rent contribution from my roommate, I get about $3,400 after-tax money every month to put away.

I'm pretty naturally frugal. I track NW monthly in these charts as well.\n* I paid off my car this year!! Maxed 403b, Roth IRA, I-bonds. This is the first year I have ever been close to maxing these retirement accounts available to me and I am stoked. Next year I get an HSA so that's to be added to the list!\n* in 2020 as I began investing, I learned a harsh lesson about single stocks. Invested about $6000 into my Roth IRA, thinking I could make some tax-free gains. In the beginning, I was up about $5000 in a few weeks, and thought this was great! I'm the smartest! Unfortunately I was caught bag-holding and that +$5000 quickly became -$5000. Learned a great deal from that, with a non-tax-harvestable $5000 loss. Now we are index fund gang for life.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHISTORY and INCOME\n\n* Divorced parents and 3 other siblings. Attempted to join the military out of high-school but could not due to medical issues. Mom stayed at home, dad construction. Not poor, but close. A fond memory I recall is \"loaning\" my dad $500 I got for my 13th birthday party \"or we wouldn't be able to go to vacation for the 2nd year in a row and it would be my fault.\" Never saw that money back, who'da thunk! Parents had their addictions and dad was in-and-out of jail occasionally in my teens. Better now and have a good relationship, but watching my parents grow up very much cemented the idea that I was going to do better. Parents have 0 savings and I am still asked to loan them money at least monthly. I will give my (possible, future) kids better.\n* 2018 - Graduated college Summer of '18 with a Bachelor's, unfortunately a mostly useless degree without going on further into a masters\/etc. First and only child to go to\/graduate college so far. Mom remarried in my first year of college to a gentleman making about 100k which unfortunately counted towards my FAFSA and I wasn't eligible for much aid, despite not getting assistance from my step-dad financially, which I wouldn't expect! I worked part time throughout school to pay what I could\/rent and graduated with about 55k in student loans. Moved to WV for a change in scenery and to start work. Made about $15\/hour for the final few months, lived with a roommate.\n* 2019 - In the same position, continued to work for the whole year with no change, maybe 45-50 hours a week on average.\n* 2020 - Decided $15\/hour wasn't enough with a Bachelor's and 50k student debt. Found a year-long program that would increase my income to about 55k base. Worked about 30hours\/week while in school 40hours\/week for the program.\n* 2021 - Graduated mid '21 from the program, moved about an hour or so for the new job. $27\/hour. Nice, nearly doubled my income! First paycheck hit and I remember it being more than I would make working 20 hours of overtime on previous job. Felt so good! Was fast approaching $0 NW and excited.\n* 2022 - Came off probationary period for work, proved I could do what I needed and became independent in work. Raise to base $29\/hour. Solid amount of overtime available. On call periodically, I pick it up frequently from coworkers because I have the time to work now. I probably average 50hours\/week currently and 10 on call\/week!\n\nFIRE TARGET and PLANS:\n\nI haven't built the life I want to live yet. I'm considering moving to a HCOL state where rent runs about $1200\/month and remaining around 70-80k\/pay. This will be a pay-cut unless I can find a job that offers more income, but right now I'm pretty bored living where I am. I live about an hour from closest friends and two hours from family. This move would put me squarely in the middle of a dozen friends, and I'm considering it as a big QOL improvement. My current goal FIRE amount is $1.5mm.

In 2022, I quit my job in late September after finding another job (unrelated to the tech layoffs this year). I thought it would be nice to take an extended vacation and set my start date for 2023.\n\nMy cash-flow and investment strategy is entirely hands-off. My checking account is configured to invest any amount above $4000 into my brokerage account, and refill up to $3750 via a margin loan when it goes beneath that amount. I don't have an emergency fund \u2014\u00a0I subscribe to [ERN's thoughts on keeping everything invested](https:\/\/earlyretirementnow.com\/2016\/05\/05\/emergency-fund\/). So that means I was going to have to live off of $4k + margin for three months. It's interesting to consider because I would have had the same financial scenario had I been laid off.\n\n# Finances\n\nIn 2021, I spent $47k (comparable to previous years, trending slightly upwards), but in 2022, I spent a staggering $95k. This was due to a lot of larger purchases: $20k car (bought in cash); $8k medical bill; $7k on vacation; $6k on wedding deposits (expecting to run up to $30k total over this year).\n\nFor discretionary expenses from 2021 to 2022:\n\n* Eating out: $4.3k \u2192 $5.1k\n* Leisure: $3.7k \u2192 $2.9k\n* Vacation: $3.2k \u2192 $7.7k\n* Gifts: $3.1k \u2192 $3.6k\n* Dates: $2.3k \u2192 $3.5k\n* Productivity: $0.5k \u2192 $1.8k\n\nI don't feel bad about spending more on dates, gifts, or productivity. Eating out and leisure together total around the same amount. I incurred >2x more vacation costs in 2022; probably a combination of relaxed COVID restrictions and attributing one 2023 vacation to 2022 costs.\n\nI incurred \\~$20k of margin debt in Q4 2022... and I feel fine! The margin is drawn against a \\~$600k account. Recent interest rate increases mean that I'm paying more in interest for that margin, but it's a small enough amount (in relative terms) that I don't feel the need to sell stock to pay it down. To be honest, if I were laid off, I would be comfortable spending several more months without income in order to find a good job, rather than just the first one available. What a luxury!\n\nI think the lesson here is that I need to adjust my expected spending rate in retirement higher to accommodate for larger expenses which I historically haven't had a lot of. Living off of margin, without an emergency fund, hasn't presented a problem so far.\n\n# Sabbatical\n\nSo I get to take a sabbatical and go on test-FIRE for three months! My top goal was to reestablish to a routine gym schedule and go 100% of days when not traveling. I used a habit tracker and I've gone 80% of days in total, which I consider a success overall. I've built a significant amount of strength since reestablishing a schedule.\n\nMy secondary goals were:\n\n* Play my favorite video game competitively. I went to in-person tournaments and improved my skill level in some areas, but honestly, I'm performing about as well in Jan 2023 as in Jan 2022. I think I need to get a coach, analyze my games more, and establish a better technical practice routine.\n* Arrange music. I did very little of this, to be honest. I still feel very much limited by my instrumental performance ability, not my arrangement ability. However, my performance ability has significantly increased over 2022, and I think especially during my sabbatical period, so I don't think I need a change of strategy yet.\n* Learn a new language. Given that I wasn't really immersing myself, I didn't expect to have a lot of success, but I fun doing vocabulary practice and puzzling out the translations of memes.\n* Do more open-source software development. I was productive and even accumulated my first GitHub sponsors.\n* Write more blog posts. I wrote 5 total in 2022, of which 4 were during the sabbatical period. I got 2.7k views on my most popular post among those.\n* Spend more time with friends and family. Well, I certainly wanted to spend more time with them, but they were still all working their jobs, so they couldn't just skive off whenever they wanted. So I planned a few events ahead of time for us (and was able to drive us all there, thanks to the purchase of a car), and visited some of them for lunch\/dinner during\/after their workdays.\n\nIt's clear that I have plenty to do to occupy myself without a job. I haven't really felt the need to quantify or assess my goals formally, as long as I'm doing something from the above in a given day.\n\nSetting a routine for the day is really important to avoid wasting time and regretting it afterwards (wasted time which was enjoyed is not wasted!). I started going to cafes in the mornings with my laptop, just to get out of the house and have a change in scenery. In retirement, I think I'll have to plan to have a space outside the house, whether it's some assortment of cafes, parks, or even a coworking space to hang out in. That will be an important consideration when deciding what neighborhood to live in in retirement.\n\n# Takeaways\n\n* Margin isn't that scary; consider it.\n* Plan for more big one-off expenses.\n* I don't feel bad spending more on loved ones; and that's an easy type of spending to cut back on, if necessary.\n* Sabbaticals are good. Plan things for your friends.\n* Prioritize one habit or behavior to establish at a time, and measure that. The rest can be just for fun.","upvote_ratio":0.63,"created_utc":1672724297.0},{"title":"Moving from MCoL with above-average income smallish town to HCoL with average\/a bit over average income big town?","author":"LegatusDivinae","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/financialindependence\/comments\/102z9gz\/moving_from_mcol_with_aboveaverage_income\/","text":"I live in a place where I have a decent standard of living compared to average (**in EU**), but nothing special that would allow me to meet my goals, just a \"a bit better food\" kind of situation.\n\nNow, if I were to move out of my country and move into some HCoL country, but with higher income, I would be in a similar situation (**I work in tech**). \"A bit better food\" but a nice house and FI would still be out of reach.

Moderators: this is not the right locations, please feel free to delete\\]\n\n**Introduction**\n\nWe're a dual-income, no kids married couple living in the San Francisco Bay Area. I\u2019ve been a lurker on this forum for a while and really appreciate the sense of community we have. We know that we are in a very privileged position, and we are also not perfect with our finances, so would appreciate everyone\u2019s advice.\n\n**Age \/ Industry \/ Location**\n\nI\u2019m 33 and my partner is 37. I work in Tech and my partner works in Health Care, both focusing on Strategy and Operations. We have lived together in New England since 2018 and recently moved to the Bay Area in 2022\n\n**Target FIRE Age \/ Amount \/ Withdrawal Rate \/ Location**\n\nOur overall goal is to reach financial independence so we can work on our own terms while maintaining an upper-middle-class lifestyle.\n\n* **Target financial independence age**: \\~late 40s\/early 50s. Given how driven we both are, I doubt we would retire at this point, but we may decide to scale back on work. Even after we fully retire, I think we may actually pick up some part-time jobs (e.g. I teach Zumba and Dancing, my partner does MBA and Career coaching on the side)\n* **Amount**: \\~$4M-$6M net worth\n* **Withdrawal rate**: \\~4%, but honestly this is more the rule of thumb we know about and haven\u2019t thought much about this\n* **Location**: I\u2019m from South East Asia (my parents and entire extended family are there), while my partner is from Pennsylvania. We want to be able to split our time between South East Asia and the US (uncertain on US location at the moment, but likely CA\/MA\/PA)\n\n**Educational Background & Plans**\n\nWe both have MBAs, and my partner also has an MS in Information Systems. We do not plan to get more education.\n\n* I went to a top 3 Liberal Arts college and a top 10 US MBA school, both with full ride scholarships\/financial aid (very fortunate and privileged situation I must admit).\n* My partner went to a top 30 national university and top 10 healthcare-focused US MBA school, with some outstanding student loan debt (broken out in the Debt section below).\n\n**Career Context & Plans**\n\nWe\u2019re both mid-career professionals (\\~10 years of work experience) and have been relatively successful (we think). We plan to stay in our current industry (Tech for me, Healthcare for my partner) but have NO desire to make it to c-suite level executives.\n\n* **My career path**: Financial Data Analyst (\\~4 years), Strategy Consultant and Manager (\\~3 years), Tech Strategy and Operations (\\~2 years)\n* **My partner\u2019s career path**: Healthcare Provider Operations (\\~4 years), Healthcare Payer Strategy & Operations (\\~8 years)\n\n**Current \/ Future Income Breakdown**\n\nCurrent total comp between the two of us is \\~$420K all in, broken out as follows:\n\n* Base salary: \\~$330K\n* Cash-based bonus: \\~$50K. Target 15% bonus rate for both of our companies, assuming average performance)\n* Equity: \\~$40K. I receive RSU from my Tech company. We usually do not sell these and hold onto them as part of our our long-term retirement\n\nI anticipate receiving **a promotion mid-2023**, in which case our **total comp** would probably **jump to \\~$500K-$520K** via base salary and equity increase (full year basis, pro-rated for 2023 it\u2019s probably a 25% bump)\n\nIn addition, we have the following retirement income matches from our company:\n\n* **My employer**: 50% match up to maximum 401k contribution, comes out to about \\~$11K since I always max out my 401k\n* **My partner\u2019s employer**: 5% match-free salary contribution starting after two years of full-time work (he joined in the past 6 mo)\n* **My partner\u2019s employer also provides a pension** that vests after 5 years of service, fully vested after 30 years. At the 30 year mark the pension is anticipated to pay out \\~50% of final salary including a spousal survival benefit\n\n**Net Worth**\n\n* Our current total net worth is \\~$750K, with \\~$1.8M in total assets (including primary residence + cars) and \\~$1.05M in total liability\n\n**Asset & Debt breakdown, including home, cars, etc**: total is $1.8M including primary residence + car + emergency savings. If we exclude these, it\u2019s about $670K in invested assets\n\n* **Primary residence ($1.05M)**: we recently bought a 2B2B condo in Oakland CA at $1.05M. It\u2019s in a great building and the primary school ranking is 8\/10. We plan to stay here at least for the next 5 years\n* **1 Car ($31K):** we bought our plug-in hybrid car about a year ago before the earlier federal tax credit ran out and have successfully obtained California CAV decal stickers for discounted FasTrak bridge\/HOV lane tolls\n* **401k ($415K):** total 401k balance between us two. I would say most of these are pre-tax dollars and invested in target retirement index funds\/S&P 500 index funds\n* **Roth IRA ($175K)**: total Roth IRA contribution between us two. Some of these are converted 401k from my prior employers, some are direct back-door and mega-backdoor Roth contributions. All invested in target retirement index funds\/S&P 500 index funds\n* **HSA ($15K)**: we haven\u2019t been contributing to HSA in recent years since our old companies did not offer a high deductible health plan. We plan to start contributing this year and plan to use this as a savings vehicle rather than a healthcare expense vehicle. All invested in target retirement index funds\/S&P 500 index funds\n* **Brokerage investment ($18K)**: every month we put \\~$800 into after tax brokerage accounts, but likely will have to reallocate this to our HSA and LPFSA contribution starting this year. All invested in target retirement index funds\/S&P 500 index funds\n* **Equity ($45K):** this is my vested equity amount. Have been holding onto it for a while\n* **Emergency savings ($50K):** this sits in a high yield online savings account\n\n**Debt breakdown**\n\n* **Primary residence ($995K)**: we recently bought our home and got a 5.75% credit union mortgage rate. Obviously hoping to refinance if mortgage rates were to come down.\n* **Car loan ($33K)**: We got our car loan at an extremely cheap credit union rate (<2%).\n* **Student loan ($27K)**: my partner has a minimal outstanding federal student loan balance, combined interest rate is 5.5%\n\n**Budget breakdown** \\- note that we recently purchased a home + switched health plans, so those items are definitely just an estimate. If you all notice anything strange with this budget, would appreciate your feedback.\n\n* **Monthly income (all-in, pre-tax)**: \\~$35K\n* **Monthly pre-tax salary**: \\~$27.5K\n* **Automated monthly investment:** \\~$11K\n   * **Equity vesting**: \\~$3K pre-tax\n   * **401k pre-tax savings**: \\~$3.75K (=$22.5K\\*2\/12) - we maxed out our pre-tax 401k savings between the two of us\n   * **Roth IRA savings**: \\~$1.1K (=$6.5K\\*2\/12) - we both contribute to our Roth IRA using our back-door Roth contribution\n   * **401k after-tax savings**: \\~$2.7K - my employer\u2019s 401k plan offers after-tax contribution and in-plan conversion, so I also contribute this to the max\n   * **HSA and Limited Purpose FSA contribution**: \\~$730\n* **Housing expenses**: \\~$8K\n   * **Mortgage P&I**: $5.8K. Definitely want to refinance to reduce this amount\n   * **PMI**: $233. Definitely want to pay down our mortgage so we can get rid of this PMI\n   * **HOA**: $750. Yes this is quite a bit, but our building has a lot of amenities which I enjoy, and this is still about \u2153 lower than equivalent buildings in our neighborhood\n   * **Property taxes**: $1.1K\n   * **Home Insurance & warranty**: $100\n* **Other debt payment**: \\~$1.3K\n   * **Car**: $625\n   * **Student loan**: $650\n* **Other Expense**: \\~$5K\n   * Grocery + eating out: $3K (yes we know this is a lot and are hoping to reduce this in the near future)\n   * Car insurance + Gas\/EV: $200\n   * Out of pocket medical expense: $800\n   * Subscription: $400 (yes, we know we have a lot here - Spotify, Hulu, Netflix, HBO, Disney+, YouTube, Economist, WSJ, NYTimes, Google Drive)\n   * Everything else would be a miscellaneous expense (e.g. entertainment, dancing classes, shopping, gifts, travel, etc.)\n\n**Health concerns**\n\nWe\u2019re both relatively healthy and active, though we could 100% benefit from losing weight and eating healthier, which is one of our 2023 goals. We do utilize a lot of therapy \/ mental health services to deal with our stress. We are trying out a high-deductible health plan in 2023 which will either be a longer-term good idea or a one-time effort soon to be abandoned.\n\n**Family: current situation \/ future plans \/ special needs \/ elderly parents**\n\nWe want to have kids, but not 100% sure on timing, likely not in the next 5 years. We both value education quite a bit and so would want to save for their education.\n\nMy parents fortunately have saved enough for their comfortable retirement, though we want to be able to help them with international trips etc.\n\nMy partner is a bit estranged from his family, though when push comes to shove we would likely end up supporting part of his parents\u2019 retirement.\n\n**Questions?**\n\n* Are we on track for our financial independence goals (\\~$4M-$6M net worth by late 40s\/early 50s)? If not, what are some things we could tweak to reach this goal?\n* What are some considerations we should have given that we just closed on our first home?\n* Anything else we should optimize for in the short\/medium\/long-term?","upvote_ratio":0.34,"created_utc":1672789413.0},{"title":"New to HSA employer use\u2019s optum bank","author":"ElRhinoMexicano","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/financialindependence\/comments\/102ohyy\/new_to_hsa_employer_uses_optum_bank\/","text":"Was up guys!

This is my first post on this sub. About a fifteen months ago I had made the decision to kickstart my life towards self-improvement in all regards: mental, physical, etc.\n\nDebriefing myself, I am currently twenty working as cook. I rent my own apartment and am financially stable with disposable income, nor do I have ongoing debt. I have stocks, IRA, savings account with a APYs. (Might do some CDs next) As well as recently starting to work on courses for Data Analysis.\n\nWith the New Year, I thought it would be a great to check-in with myself and reassess my goals if need be. I've laid the groundwork to create something for myself, but I feel like I am missing something that brings people from the majority to the minority financially,\n\nMy plans currently are to continue with the course and a few other I saw. Afterwards, use that to freelance and possibly start a YT channel about self-development. Also, with the money I am saving to take a course on phlebotomy, so that I may raise my base income. Or maybe a trade job(?).\n\nTo conclude, I am asking for people's opinion on how my present trajectory and if these tasks aid to my goal or if there are ways that I can refine the ongoing path towards financial freedom?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Edit**: Would like to preface and say thanks for all the comments negative and positive! Feedback is always appreciated. \n\nFirstly, I wanted to explain a little more on my current job position, a cook. That's just to get money. It's not my profession, nor is it a passion of mine. It's a way to make capital to reimburse into other avenues.\n\n Secondly, phlebotomy is just a way to test whether I like the medical field and my thoughts on it. I might drop it, considering the majority of the comments.\n\nThirdly, a few people had mentioned a trade; this is also something that's been on my back - burner. I'm waiting until spring to start job hunting in that market as there'll be job opportunities where I live. I will most likely do more research into this now.\n\nLastly, I know that the journey is long and is built on delayed gratification not on something I can do by tomorrow. That's why I made this post; so people who have achieved higher can help me avoid mistakes that may cost years.

Numbers are for 2 adults. If anybody would like a copy of the sheet I use you can click [here](https:\/\/docs.google.com\/spreadsheets\/d\/11_8-x72AhngLG2sN2L9fRTPdqUOkkxDXH3MsJv8k3Gk\/copy). As usual, let me know if anything doesn't jive!\n\nHere is a link to last year's submission: [2021](https:\/\/old.reddit.com\/r\/financialindependence\/comments\/rtltdg\/2021_year_in_review_my_4th_annual_submission\/)\n\nFor the last 7 years, at the end of the year I always crunch some numbers to see how our finances look in order to get a complete picture of our path towards financial independence. I add up all of our major assets, subtract all of our debts and come up with our net worth and find the year over year changes.\n\nI then separately add up our retirement assets (essentially net worth subtracting home equity), figure out what our average monthly expenses were and perform some rudimentary calculations to project how many years from being Financially Independent we are. Essentially, I follow [MMM's Shockingly Simple Math](https:\/\/www.mrmoneymustache.com\/2012\/01\/13\/the-shockingly-simple-math-behind-early-retirement\/)\n\nNote: I actually began tracking all of this in the middle of 2015. So there is a bonus 6 months at the start that can be more or less disregarded for purposes of looking at annual variations.\n\n### Numbers\n\n* Net Worth Change: +7% \n* Debt Change: -25%\n* Retirement Change: +2.7%\n* Monthly FI Expenses Change: +1%\n* Savings Rate Change: +4%\n\nFinal Savings Rate: 75%\n\nYears until FI (change from last year): 5 (0)\n\nRaw\/chart:\n\n[Net Worth](https:\/\/ibb.co\/mbPf6Kh)\n\n[Chart](https:\/\/ibb.co\/mGyLWk5)\n\n[Monthly Retirement Numbers](https:\/\/ibb.co\/Jtt4sVH)\n\n### Reflection & Goals\n\nAll in all we had a fantastic year as far as the financial picture is concerned, even if it didn't move the needle much as far as possible FI goes. Any increase, no matter how small, in net worth and our accounts after a year where the markets were down so much I'm going to consider a huge win.. even if it's all from contributions and increased property valuation. \n\nIt's humorous to me that as I wrote last years update I realized my allocations were out of whack and far too bond heavy. I ended up moving around $150k from bonds to international stock in Q1 last year, unfortunately half of that total came on the first of the year. Ahh well, live and learn. At least I got our asset allocation corrected and we didn't have to touch anything the rest of the year. As of today it's looking pretty good, still about 5% more cash heavy than I would like but will be buying more VTSAX in the brokerage (Finally opened one a couple of months back) with it over the next couple of months and possibly purchasing a new vehicle. Current allocations are:\n\n* Domestic Stock: 40%\n* International Stock: 37%\n* Bonds: 10%\n* Cash: 13%\n\nNow that I've got the Asset Allocation figured out and our brokerage has been opened, our goals for finances are largely to just ignore things this year and continue to throw excess funds in the brokerage. We've already made our yearly i-bond purchase and due to our IRA balances and employer 401k plans M\/BDR is a no-go. I suppose I should learn what the heck \"Tax Loss Harvesting\" is at some point, but don't think it's urgent. Mostly just on auto-pilot mode. \n\nOn the life side of things, last year continued to be stressful as ever and we need to continue to focus on personal health and long-term sustainability career and lifestyle wise. My wife and I are both burnt out and seeking change. Personally I loathe the idea of retiring early about as much as the idea of needing a job until old age, so would very much like to find some sort of gig that better aligns with my needs. Applied for a few jobs last year but no luck so far.\n\nWe solidified a lot of things that were up in the air last year or things we knew we should do but just never got around to chiefly planning end of life things with an estate attorney and making decision not to have children permanent. It's nice to not have to worry about the what-ifs there, both financially and as far as life goes. I find that those types of things always add a constant level of background noise and stress to us, so it's best when we talk them out, make a decision and then take action.\n\nI wish I had more concrete goals honestly.. but other than \"don't fuck it up\" and \"be healthy and happy\" I find it difficult to form them when I am mostly-content. Getting comfortable with being secure and content has been difficult enough the last couple of years, but here we are. I guess next up I need to get comfortable with the idea of being old and death.. but I'm not ready for that just yet LOL.\n\nLastly, I want to say that I appreciate all of the information and banter from all of you in the daily, especially over the last couple of years, as I think that we really are helping people reach some of their financial goals, as well as providing a \"community\" feel to this sub that a lot of folks appreciate. I've been absorbing information posted here for a decade now and it has been a great help on my journey. \n\nIf anybody has any questions or thoughts on the sheet or this post let me know.

However, after 4 months of working with the SBA advisor group (SCORE) it is clear that I am still nowhere near ready to invest in a business by myself at this point as (I feel) that I do not have the experience yet to confidently run a business. In addition, I currently have an unrelated (high-paying) job and I am not ready to make the leap into entrepreneurship until I have some experience in the spaces I'd like to invest. While the businesses are simplistic in nature (ie. Gas Stations & Laundromats) I recognize that there are many complexities that I am unequipped to deal with having had zero experience in the space. Additionally, I am limited in the funding I can throw into the business god forbid something goes wrong. For this reason, I have concluded that for my first deal, I do not want to be on the hook for the full equity amount of the business until I understand more about the space\n\nThe current solution that I would like to pursue is to bring one or multiple equity partners to help me on my first deals so that I can learn the ropes. From my previous explorations in RE I understand that there are scenarios where \"wholesalers\" bring investors deals in exchange for equity in the property and the ability to see how investors underwrite and manage deals. Do these scenarios also exist in the world of small business acquisitions?

To my surprise, I regularly found my coworkers talk about how they couldn't afford basic things. Many of them had no NW despite working their $100k+\/yr job for over a decade. At the time I wondered, \"How is that possible?\" I genuinely couldn't spend that much money if I tried.\n\nI've realized its because of their expectations in life: maybe private school for all their kids, a big home in their favorite location, nice cars or expensive wine. Whatever it is, each item my coworkers added to their list of life expectations negatively affected their outlook on their personal finances.\n\nOf course, that's not to say life expectations are bad. Everyone would argue some expectations in life (food, water) are justified and others are not ($1bn McMansion and a private island). Where you draw the line is up to you.
