        "text": "So, I got into a game of Pathfinder with 3 new players, and one semi-experienced GM. I am playing a rogue because we needed a thief, we have a cleric, a monk, and a dwarf battle cleric hybrid. We are playing the pirate campaign (can't remember the name off the top of my head). Anyway, we successfully take the second ship, and it's the first night on board. Plugg and Scourge are having their little rendezvous with their cronies about how best to kill us. Now, to back up a bit, our dwarf has some very strong spells due to wisdom based magic and a modifier of +4. He keeps wanting to summon a level 4 monster, when we are at level 2. Anyway, this conference is going on in the captain's quarters, I sneak up to listen at the door. We decide to off these guys right away, so everyone but the dwarf succeeds in a sneak roll. The door is flung open, roll for initiative. Dwarf gets to go first, summons a bunyip inside the quarters. We all cheer. Top of the next round, bunyip uses fear, which hits all creatures within 25 meters. Our monk, our badass monk that hits twice each round with +2 to attack and +6 to damage, and has been one hitting all the bad guys up until this point, fails his fear save. He turns and runs. We all yell at the dwarf. Pirates turn to fear save. Our GM, bless his heart, rolls a crit fail. Then confirms with a 3. All *8* pirates commit suicide they are so afraid, the boss leaps out the window into the ocean, and the bunyip pursues him into the water. We've won. 30 seconds of dead silence, followed by 25 minutes of uproarious laughter. ",

        "text": "tl;dr: Started with some off-session recon, now I have a daughter until I kill myself\n\nSo, some quick notes: I'm DMing a heist during a ball soon, but am normally a player, so my character is technically a DMPC during all this, but the general feel is that it's all good with how I handled it.\n\nSo we started with a two-on-one off-session to gather intel and get someone on the inside for a heist. After some quick rolls and RP, our Skinwalker Hunter and his Lion companion get hired as entertainment for a noble's ball. Then it shifts to one-on-one while a different PC (who had acted as the Hunter’s agent) pokes around for the local thieves' guild and anything they can offer. In the end, the guild makes an offer to help as long as we take out a guy, with bonuses if we don't make it obvious he was killed; he's also our in to the ball, as we might have a chance to replace him. They let us borrow some Gloves of Reconnaissance, which allow the wearer to see through walls. DJ the B, as he is known, is described as \"a flighty motherfucker who killed three assassins sent after him at the same time. Well, two at the exact same time, with one into the other, and then the third shortly after.\"\n\nThe plan was outlined simply. We make a felony-quantity of hardcore drugs with the intent to plant it on him so that one of us may assume his identity to attend the ball, while disguising him as a street-level junkie of some kind. Instead of having to kill him, which left a bad taste in our Chaotic and Neutral Good characters' mouths, he'd JUST go to jail for life, but still satisfy the Thieves' Guild's request to remove him from the scene.\n\nA short time later, we gather most of the crew (4 of us, minus the lion and an Alchemist). The Slayer sneaks up to the building and uses the Gloves of Recon to get the drop on him, but finds that DJ the B has a wife and five-year-old daughter. The party shouts a collective \"FUCK\" as their plan falls to shreds.\n\nThe players are presented with their first real roleplaying conundrum, as the wife and child are clearly easy targets to take out, but only the Evil Sorcerer and Hunter are really willing, and the rest of the party won't have it. \n\nAfter great deliberation, the party surrounds the house, and we have the nicest, goodest character (the Bloodrager) knock on the door. DJ the B answers, a Halfling Brawler (though the party assumes Monk). He makes it known that he is aware of the entire party, having noticed the Slayer sneaking up earlier. The Bloodrager attempts to coerce him out of the house, or find a way in, wanting to peacefully resolve the situation. Finally, he makes a single veiled threat- and DJ relents, stepping back to allow him in. The Bloodrager does.\n\n\"Roll a Reflex save against the trap.\" The save is made, and the Burning Hands trap on the doorway only does half damage. The fight begins, with windows being busted in, blows being exchanged, and the wife reveals a Liquid Blade hidden on her. Then my character, the Sorcerer, attacks the child with Burning Hands, DC 16- and the child rolls a 19 for half damage, and is knocked unconscious (instead of instantly killed). DJ the B then screams in a rage as he runs to his daughter's side- only to be knocked unconscious by the Bloodrager's nonlethal Attack of Opportunity. The Slayer follows up by grappling and knocking out the wife, as well, while the Bloodrager stabilizes the daughter. \n\nNow safely out of danger, everything goes to shit. The Bloodrager takes a swing at the Sorcerer (missing on a nat 1, showing there's no justice in the world) and picks up the child to leave the building. The Sorcerer and Slayer deliberate over how to handle what the hell just happened.\n\nOutside, a man sees the well-cooked daughter (yeah, I know, I'm an asshole) and freaks out. The Bloodrager fails to claim the situation is okay, and the man runs off, clearly to find some guards. Unbeknownst to my players, at this time I set an IRL timer for 10 minutes.\n\n'Rager comes inside, relays the information, and I lead by example by RPing, panicked, trying to piece together our story- our original plan is back on, with a twist. I should note that I'm in full PC mode here- I couldn't have known things would turn out like this, so we're all in the same shit-boat together. I manage to roll crazy high on a Disguise check to appear to be DJ, according to plan, while I coordinate an explanation on our story. Two druggies broke in, and the wife was a druggie, too- I just didn't know. My two personal guards, the 'Rager and Slayer, saved me by knocking them out, but the other (entirely nonexistent) one escaped, explaining all the broken windows. We planted drugs on the parents, and the little girl, now my \"daughter\" is unconscious because she triggered the front door's Burning Hands trap when she ran to escape. Oh, and the Hunter needs to GTFO, because he has no social skills and is more of a liability than anything to our success at this point, looking like a half-beast terror.\n\nThen the timer goes off, and my players freak as I say \"Shit, the guards are here!\" What followed was nothing less than a series of truly godly rolls as we roll nothing but 18s and above when relaying this story to the guards. Disguise, Bluff, Diplomacy, even Perception for noticing details we didn't know (the daughter's name) or finding the invitation to the ball. The guards take the parents away to be locked up forever, the evidence amply stacked against them for felony drug possession and home invasion. I ask for a caretaker for my daughter, not wanting to send her off to a real magical healer so she can wake up too early and spill the beans. She'll wake up in a few days, after the ball, during which I've hopefully faked my death (as her father) and willed her my estate. You know, so the party won't fucking murder me for attempting to kill a child. Which I am, I mean, a LITTLE guilty about. And the Slayer’s Sense Motive roll of 20 confirmed it to the party. (Yeah, my character IS that much of an asshole.)\n\nAt least nobody died all session.\n",

        "text": "**Party Roster** OZACK: Monk Party Leader KOGA: Sorcerer WHISPER: Ranger  EIFLEE: Tinker  SUNFLOWER: Druid\n\nSunflower's story begins with caravan. he wasn't following it for any particular reason. He was a man of the world\ntraveling from place to place as the wind took him. This particular caravan happened to be heading to Juno. A city\nbarely 25 years old that was already a multistory (like actual sections of the city sitting atop one another) \nmetroplis with booming trade. Out of the caravan there were two other travelers that stood out. One was Eiflee the\ntinker, and the other a stern monk known as Ozack. Well, as with most things, Sunflower preferred to solve his problems\nwith herb. So he wonders over Ozack and says; \"Hey man, wanna hit.\" Ozack ponders it for a second and takes one. He\nproceeds to fail every FORT save (I swear the guy didn't get above a ten), So until he can pass one he's baked out of his\nmind. And I mean really bad, like wandering around and talking about pretty stars and how everything just looks so... wonderful.\n\nSunflower offers some to the Eiflee, who, after seeing Ozack, declines. After the caravan raching Juno we all disembark and\n,while Ozack is still pratically incoherent, Sunflower does learn he's here to sign up as an adventurer. Well Sunflower isn't\njust going to let the poor guy go stumbling around in his condition so he decides to take him to the guild hall. Eiflee relunctantly\ndecides to lead them there. So we all climb aborad one of the many elevators the go between sections of the city. \n\nUnbeknownst to all of us Eiflee has a problem. He likes to... tinker. So with one Sleight of Hand check and a Device roll later. He\nsurreptiously popped the control panel off the elvator and begins to \"optimize\" it. So we, the elvator guard and 2 noblewomen, pile into the\nelvator. The guard hits the button and the elvator rockets upward slamming everyone, except Sunflower and Eiflee, against the floor.\nOzack, finally regains his senses and begins screaming at the top of his lungs as the elvator does it's level best to attain orbit\nbefore it comes to a screeching halt. The brakes are glowing red and Ozack is still screaming. The 2 ladies rush out of the elevator \nand the guard manages to get us and the sobbing Ozack out of the elvator. \n\nOzack wobbles his way towards the guild hall and Eiflee and Sunflower follow. We find out that the only guild available is a new one\ncalled The Looking Glass. So after some inital sign ups and Sunflower offering everyone a congralutory smoke, everyone refuses except\none guard who feels WONDERFUL for the next 6-8 hours. We finally land our first job.\n\nWe are supposed to escort a Moblin merchant and his caravan to collect some goods from his people's mine and return to Juno. The trip\nthere is pretty uneventful. Now, and this is important, Moblins can't breath our air normally. They all have special filters and \nbreathing apperatuses when they travel above ground. So after loading up the cart at the mine we are on our way. And then we are attacked\nby these strange water creatures, and we screw up and our Moblin buddy dies. We manage to find out it was a water creature callled A Sahugen.\nBut then the Moblin is possesed by this weird black shadow who begins using his body as a puppet. He starts shouting at us \"DECIEVERS! TRAITORS!\"\n\nNow in story we are actually in a very fragile state of peace with the Moblins. If this highly respected merchant starts saying we're traitors\nwe could end up in a war with the Moblins. But we're a good party so killing him is out of the question. So the party is stuck between a rock\nand a hard place. Then Sunflower says: \"Whoa guys, I totally have a solution for this.\" He then pops off the the air filter to the captured Moblin\nand tosses in a lit blunt. The Moblin is still shouting: \"TRAITORS, DECIEVERS,...Rainbows, Unicorns, Fairy Powder\" and slumps over happily muttering.\n\nWe turn him back to his people who believe that their merchant is just babbling nonsense.\n\nI still have a few Sunflower stories if anyone cares to hear them.",

I thought I would be a lot farther ahead i the story and was worried I didn't have enough material. Instead I only went 20% into the material. I forgot how long normal interactions take. I didn't think I did too well until I heard some feed back. I think next game will be even better.\n\nI'm happy in the end and can see the climax for the story will even have a bigger impact.\n\n https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x06gE3MfXNI",

I rolled up a half human half elf character and decided I wanted to speak draconian much to my Dm's surprise. Most people of played with never bothered with it. \nOne session we are walking through a coal root Forrest (coal root is a tree that when harvested can be turned into a narcotic that my character was addicted to) we stop to harvest some as it goes for a good price and we figure we can sell some for some easy coin at the next town we reach.\nAs we go about this we come across a group of bird people stripping the Forrest. They seem in quiet a hurry and tell us it's because a black dragon lives here. This is his Forrest and doesn't tate kindly to being robed. They scamper and we stumble across the dragon. He isn't happy at seeing the damage done to his Forrest. The dm turns to me and has me make a diplomacy roll to win over the dragon. This turns into me rapping to the dragon while two of our party beat box for me. I roll a 19 and manage to pull it off. The dragon accepts up and we tell him what happened here. He isn't happy and asks us to show him where the intruders are. We agree and hop on his back and lead him to the area we met the birds. \nThey see us coming and freak out. They take off and we follow them. All the way back to their city. Once we get close enough we see that it is a floating city attached to some magical bolder by a chain that keep it from falling. We get closer and the dm tells us that as they see a dragon flying towards them they open fire with a ballista and nail the dragon in the ass. He is less then impressed with this and lands on the side of the floating boulder. \nMy self and the party minotaur come up with an idea. He uses his strength to pull out the ballista and get ready a shot. I use my vision to pick a target. We decide on the gunner who fired it. My friend let's loose the shot with such force when it hits it impaled the gunner with such force it goes through him lodges in his chair and rips the ballista off its mountings.\nThe locals get mad at this and take flight to engage us. We take out some so combat between lighting , breaki.ribcages and faces.\nThey are having none of this and flock to together to swarm us. Seeing this we retreat to the dragon and using his flame breath we burn 80 percent of their population to death. \nIn the end we destroyed their city.

As they congratulate themselves, a human warrior falls down the staircase, and introduces himself as Iaghar. Not long after Iaghar arrives Lexter slaps him for no apparent reason, explaining his plan to \"knock him out and piss in his mouth while he's unconscious\". The party then sees 4 levers on the other side of the cave, and they walk over. Coraim shouts \"pull the lever Cronk!\", and Iaghar begins pulling all the levers... nothing happens. Next Coraim casts detect magic and detects a faint aura of illusion magic, coming from somewhere in the room, and after a while of confusion the party eventually finds out that the river blocking off the exit of the room is in fact not actually water but the illusion that was detected, ad they continue into the next room.\n\nIn the next room is a table with a deck of cards written in a strange language, which Vido promptly steals. Suddenly, two kobolds run in and are slaughtered easily. Through the next room the party finds a great forge run by kobolds, there were at least 50 of them, and there seems to be no way to fight them... but Coraim had a plan. The plan was for Iaghar to open his bottle of oil, light it, and close it again so it would explode instead of just lighting the oil on fire, and put it next to the crumbling pillars, while Vido and Lexter threw molotov cocktails made of random alcohol they had found, a rope to be used for lighting, and fire, at the kobolds to create chaos, all the while Coraim would distract the kobolds by playing terrible music (Hello by Adele) on lute, and then getting the hell out. Everything went as planned... until the party realized one thing, Coraim had tiny gnome legs, and couldn't run as fast, he was barely making it out as the ceiling collapsed, and everyone was sweating as the DM made a roll to see if he made it out...\n\nNatural 20. Everyone cheered as he narrowly escaped the collapsing chamber, leaving around 50 dead kobolds in his wake. The party continued upwards, finding a chest that contained gold and mysterious weapons with skulls on the crossbars, but they thought they looked cool and thought little of it. The party continued upwards through the passage until they reached a wine cellar filled with the finest alcohol any of them had seen, which they of course stole before continuing upwards. The next room up looked to them like the back room of a tavern, so they knocked on the door and asked if anyone was there, and apologised for breaking in, and, lo and behold, the barkeep of the inn they had stayed the previous night in stood before them, they were back where they'd started, and they'd just stolen 4 bottles of expensive wine, which Coraim was stupidly holding out in offering to the barkeep before swiftly putting it away when he realized it was his. The barkeep said he didn't care much about the wine, but he didn't believe that the party wouldn't talk, and as he turned around the party saw he had a sword on his waist with the same skull symbol that they had on the weapons they had found...\n\nCoraim pulled out his dagger with the skull on it and pressed it against the barkeeps throat, knowing he would see the symbol. \"Ah, another follower of Orcus I take it?\" (not the Roman god, the DM just stole the name) Said the barkeep. \"Uh, yah, but how do we know you're a follower of him too and you didn't just find that sword in some kobold loot stash? Maybe we should give you a pop quiz, first question, who's Orcus?\" Said Coraim. The barkeep of course didn't believe us, and we turned to threatening him, and got a very basic explanation, then when he stopped talking we killed him and read a note he had on his body from a fellow cultist, it was too cryptic to be worth paraphrasing. We searched the house for a deed to the bar (because who wouldn't want to own a bar) and when we didn't find one made another molotov and burned his house down, we then went to the library and did some research on Orcus, and found out he is a sworn enemy of Pelor. The session ended with a few **bottles** of ale or wine, depending on our tastes, at a different tavern (the one we haven't burned down yet), and getting absolutely wasted.\n\nEdit: My apologies if this isn't how you make a molotov, none of us wanted to look it up because we'd rather stay off the no fly list.",

He pitched a convoluted attempt at \"sci-fi meets fantasy\" to the guy, raising the \"very poorly written T.V. drama\" flag of anyone who was smart enough. The guy was nice enough to play along and see where it went.\n\nI was in the vicinity of two friends, let's call them \"Jessie\" and \"James\", who had played my campaigns before, and we heard the whole exchange. We guffawed at his concept and joked about it to ourselves over a facebook group chat. We cracked jokes like \"So the bard's gonna fuck a robot or an Alien first?\", \"Does the Wizard have a rocket launcher?\" and so forth. Eventually, someone posed the question, I think it was James: \n\n\"Has he ever run a game before? You should go over there and show him a thing or two.\"\n\nThat one comment spawned me, against my better judgement, to join his game. I consciously signed on to the shittiest game I've ever heard, run by the worst DM EVER...for the sole purpose of DESTROYING IT.\n\nJessie and James both joined me, Jessie played a Rogue, James built a Barbarian, and the other guy, let's call him Greg, built a Cleric. The role of \"Dedicated Caster\" fell onto me, and I played a Human Psion named Noza, with a Sword and Rifle\n\nI have not the words to describe how SHITTY the game was. We were members of an organization called the \"Star Security Club\" that was charged with protecting the \"Star Nation\" and enforcing their King's rule. His NPCs were ripped straight out of T.V. Tropes articles linked specifically to anime, lore was shitty and not at all coherent, the overall theme of the campaign was too campy even for it to be considered \"ironic\". It was like he vomited stuff that sounded \"cool\" onto a page and called it a game.\n\nHe also overlayed a bunch of bullshit homebrew rules that his NPCs followed to the letter, but all of them (except for one that will come into play later) were absolutely useless to the PCs who tried to learn them. It got so bad no one really cared about his powers anymore, and just stuck with the book stuff.\n\nI played until level six rather tamely, I didn't outright break any rules, I played along to see where it got me. I bullshitted a rule here or there in my favor, but it was little stuff that no two DMs would interpret the same way. The one thing I did egregiously bullshit was a Knowledge (Psychology) skill that he ruled \"works in place of any skill that uses a charisma bonus.\" (Knowledges are INT skills. INT is my casting stat, and already ludicrously high for my level.)\n\nLVL 6 was when my reign of chaos began. The \"king\" we were working for ended up being possessed by an outside force that caused him to attack and kill his guards. No one wanted to hurt him, and he ended up charging the party. I shot his knees out and broke his arms, disabling him from harming anyone further.\n\nPoint of note, Rubix has this pervasive, and fucking annoying, habit of making his NPCs monologue like DBZ villains way too often. It gets really hard to ask questions about an adventure when he's flappin' his yap for 45 minutes about the magical wood grain on the hilt of his sword. This particular rant eventually lead to the party having to make a choice between \"kill the king and find a new one\" or \"figure out who is doing this and murder them.\" The part decided the latter method was the best course of action, and the adventure would have gone down that route...\n\n...If I hadn't already decapitated the king with my sword, and placed his crown on my head during the monologue...\n\nI was placed in the seat of absolute power with a surprising lack of resistance from our first time DM, and was allowed access to the entirety of the resources at the kingdom's disposal. I poured all of it into creating an army of psychic robot zombies, and getting me a [kickass suit of psychic power armor and OP genetic enhancements,](http://orig14.deviantart.net/e2cb/f/2011/325/f/2/warhammer___emperor_of_mankind_by_genzoman-d4g9y0f.jpg) which granted me a whole bunch of bullshit abilities: boosting my physical stats, increasing my BAB and HD, Base speed increases, the whole nine yards.\n\nI became the most powerful king alive.\n\nFor the next four levels, I spent my time, resources and that Psychology skill I mentioned earlier rapidly taking over other kingdoms, and soon, I had the entire world underneath my boot, I had single handedly become king of the world, in the course of four levels.\n\nI was The Emperor of all Mankind.\n\nTHEN the real kicker showed up.\n\nAs part of the aforementioned \"shitty lore\", he revealed that our game universe was the \"dream world\" of our REAL universe. Everyone in the campaign was living in the collective subconscious of the world we live in. I think it was a cheap tactic to trivialize my quick and firey rise to absolute world domination. He proceeded to monologue about how beings from that world, had special, reality altering powers in this one, but had no real basis within the system we were using.\n\nI posed the question: \"Does it function like [Reality Revision?](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/psionic/powers/realityRevision.htm)\n\nHe didn't know what the rules were for it, so I explained that it's a psychic power that does pretty much what he described, and I showed him the page as linked above. \n\nHe said \"That does work exactly as I described. Mastering these powers would grant you that ability, at will, with no XP cost.\"\n\nI put all operations on hold until I mastered these powers. Some of them were skeptical of my choices, but ultimately they couldn't stop me. \n\nThat night I went home and spent 4+ hours writing out my first use of that power, I gave myself such bullshit powers like \"20 levels in every class\", \"Infinite pool of power points,\" \"the ability to use every psychic power/arcane spell/divine spell as a psychic power of the responding level.\", and anything that fell under the umbrella of **INFINITE COSMIC POWER**, and did it all in such an airtight way that he couldn't do SHIT about it. (\"Create a psionic item, or add to the powers of an existing psionic item\", my armor gave me this stuff forever.)\n\nAt the end, I added this little gem:\n\n**\"The creator of this armor can never be killed, destroyed, subdued, removed from existence, etc. by any means/being/power/etc. that has, does or will ever exist.\"**\n\nI was ready to become the god I was destined to be.\n\nTwo sessions later, I mastered the powers, and SLAMMED THAT BITCH DOWN ON THE TABLE. I read through everything, line for line, word for word, for like 20 minutes, and made sure absolutely EVERYTHING was transparent and out there for him to hear.\n\nI was now a GOD.\n\nThis brought him to utilize the one set of rules he DID know. When a god is created, or if a god exists in the mortal realm, then the realities in which he exists are destroyed. So I proceeded to destroy everything, just by being, and the party was rather pissed at me for it. Everything was destroyed, every man, woman, child, tree, dog, star, spec of dirt, ALL OF IT WAS GONE\n\nBut, thanks to my gem at the end, I survived.\n\nUsing my vast cosmic power, I proceeded to construct a new reality. Everything was rebuilt to my whim, my rules, my desires and preferences.\n\nRubix didn't get the memo. \n\nHe tried to continue the game, under his old vision.\n\nBut it was my vision, my multiverse, the entire plane of existence the party existed in was MINE.\n\nI.\n\n*IN CHARACTER.*\n\n**BECAME THE DM.**\n\nThe look on his face was fucking priceless. It was this combination of fear, betrayal, confusion, defeat, wonder and rage. IT WAS GLORIOUS.\n\nHe tried to poke every hole he could in my revision, but there was no where he could run. He stared at me, eyes wide with a belligerence that he couldn't drive past my perfectly laid out scheme.\n\nIT WAS **GLORIOUS.**\n\nI towered above the group, the usurper of a glorious throne of power, the group now under my benevolent hand.\n\nAnd do you wanna know the first thing I did?\n\nI **fired** Rubix; booted him right from the group he had started.\n\nThe party was allowed to keep their characters, sans the bullshit items they received along the way, and I proceeded to run a pretty solid game. Not my best, but certainly not my worst. We played until level 17, then the semester ended, and a good portion of us went our separate ways. The only one of them I still see on a regular basis is James, he's a member of my new Pathfinder group.\n\nand yeah, I still see Rubix. He refuses to change. He's still his old, shitty self...\n\n...he doesn't run 3.5 anymore.\n\nEDIT: I am in no way condoning my actions by saying this. I was an asshole, I admit. I did try helping him. I really, really did. Those six levels I \"played nice\" we're me trying to back him and make the game better. He blatantly ignored us.\n\nSeriously, he straight up told me: \"This is my game. Your suggestions will be taken into account when I say so.\"\n\nMy firing him was out of my conversations I had with the other players, and their distaste with him. I also put it to a vote in which neither he nor I participated, and the vote to kick him was unanimous.",

        "text": "Hello!  This is a part of a series that I have written about my experience on a minecraft server.  I will gladly elaborate on anything that you may have questions about, but would rather not directly link the subreddit for the server.  However, if you want to, I'm sure you can find it.\n\nI once played on a Minecraft server that focussed heavily on building civilization and role playing the power struggles, the rises, and the falls of nations and groups. It was deceptively simple at first glance: log in, found a nation or join one, and then… the whole world was open to whatever you made out of it. Little regulation, little interference, little guides on how to survive. \n\nBut the most terrifying thing, beneath the casual atmosphere, was the little glimpses of depravity that lurked under the surface. Slowly, carefully, darker and deeper, one would cautiously venture into the inner heart of the server, and begin to understand how it was filled with heated, bitter, real struggles between rival superpowers and alliances. Struggles and wars that would-- and did --completely end the world.\n\nI joined the server in mid-December, 2014. The server had been around for three months before my unceremonious arrival, and there were already a few prestigious mega-nations in play.  Revolution State, resting on the coast of the Great River was a militant nation with a proud history and proven past. Greyshore, a quiet trading state on the convergence of the two lesser rivers, from which they merged into the single Great to head northward. Brandenburg, a proud nation hidden in the realistically WorldPainted mountains. The Federation, a militaristic nation hidden sourly in the southern jungle had caused aggressive conflicts. \n\nAnd, possibly the most important of all, Moria. A kingdom built and etched out in the icy north. Due to their location, the citizens were determined to gather up all the diamonds on the map (exclusively located in the snowy biomes), stockpile, and eventually trade them away in small batches. This would allowing them to become the most powerful nation in the world, undisputed victors and controllers of the whole economy that balanced and thrived on access to diamonds.\n\nBut one nation would put a stop to that: Wyck.\n\nWyck was founded around the same time my newfriend self arrived at the mountainous Brandenburg’s gates. Wyck was initially nondescript, their eventual fate of the strong-willed military empire that held an iron grip on the land seemed far-fetched and laughable. Only claiming a small, practically uninhabitable mountaintop in the southern desert, and also the sole place where all the gold in the map was located, it seemed that Moria and Wyck would perhaps be allies of some terrible, omniscient alliance than sworen and battle-tested enemies at each other’s throats.\n\nVaults was a major game mechanic. Obsidian pyramids hidden deep underground, they held the trapped souls of killed players, bound to enderpearls. Once bound to an enderpearl, players would be trapped in the End. Using a vault, you could make it so that other players wouldn’t be able to release the trapped player, by reinforcing and protecting the obsidian blocks with diamonds, requiring an obscene number of breaks to finally destroy the block.\n\nI’m afraid that I have to skip over a lot of history here. Considering these events happened over a year ago, it’s hard to remember exactly what happened. Time stretches and dilates with no end, events become faded and soon may be lost to memory unless recorded somewhere. I would gladly elaborate in another post, if wanted. But before we can jump into the war, a few timeline items of note needs to be covered.\n\nOne, the Federation goes mostly inactive. A new nation tries to claim the land, but their rebellion is short lived, and they end up quickly butchered and trapped in the Federation vault. However, people begin to notice that the Federation has always been the “up to no good fellows” of the world, and public opinion quickly turns sour. Violent war seems to be looming over the horizon, but then small, nondescript Wyck steps onto the playing field to mediate the conflict. Peace is surprisingly reached, the new nation is freed from the Federation’s vault, and they depart from the Federation claims with tails between their legs, and ran from the Federation who still lusted for blood.\n\nHowever, during this conflict, a player discovers that the leader of the Federation, a man by the name of Blade, had placed a snitchgrid, or a collection of hidden blocks that record player movement within a certain radius, through almost every nation on the server in order to have a strategic map of player movement throughout the world.\n\nSnitchgrids are valuable, priceless resources. In the hands of the right people, one could feasibly watch over the entire world from the comfort of their own city. Why is this important, you ask? The founder of Brandenburg grew old, grew weary. He made me his heir, sovereign of the nation. But most importantly, he gives me the access to his own private snitchgrid, SkyNet.\n\nI wandered the land, lost for what to do. Brandenburg was empty, and only held the shadows of the golden days before. So I turned my horse southward, toward the desert, and toward Wyck. Despite me being under the firm 21+ age policy of Wyck, I made fast friends with the leaders and citizens alike, and they accepted the lonely Brandenburg ruler into their own fold. \n\nI was in something resembling a home, in a group of people building their way to prosperity. But only a few days later, the world declares war on the Federation, headed by the cold and powerful nation of Moria.\n\nWe of Wyck were caught in between, an alliance formed at the end of the mediated conflict, pulled us into the battle as well. But we were quickly killed, bound to enderpearls, and trapped in the End. We were held in the vault of a neutral, yet Morian-sympathizing man named Luni. For days, we watched from the End as surprisingly the Federation turned the sure defeat into a hollow victory against Moria. And we were freed.\n\nThe world entered a state of strangled peace, with only minor conflicts here and there. Months pass, old grudges fester and rot under the obvious new peace. Wyck and an influx of new members create a new nation, the Realm of Light, to form, and Wyck was made the capital of the Realm of Light. Both nations, Moria and the Realm, routinely make raids into the other’s territory, only to quickly run back and hide. Interestingly enough, the Lakeheart Dominion forms from the new nation that the Federation once butchered and chased off, and surprisingly becomes the Realm of Light’s ally.\n\nAnd that’s where this will start off again.  The Federation’s capital of Ameno was made the military garrison of the Realm. The Realm held a complete monopoly on the world’s gold, and quickly armored themselves into a powerful force. Gold was important, because to pearl and vault someone for a long time, you need gold to feed the vault. Many nations, including Moria, was furious. Tensions rose higher, but to expect a war to start was nothing short of crazy talk. \nThe Realm did, however, begin talking a lawless mercenary, and one of the best fighters on the server, into being a double agent for them. With Moria growing bolder and bolder each day, it seemed like pearling their king, Coyote, in a vault would cause Moria to crumble.\n\nI took up the mantle of spy from my old nation, a revived Brandenburg. Along with an ally, Angel, we would pry information from the Morians. Nothing for weeks seemed to come of my spying, until suppressed news of the Morian general, Getty getting ready to quit Moria reached our ears. We quickly abandoned Brandenburg, and after returning to the Realm, reported this to the king. \n\nI was sneeringly given the nickname “macRAT” from my betrayal.\n\nNight falls. We were chopping down acacia wood in the desert. Suddenly, I get a snitch warning from Skynet. Originating from Greyshore, increased activities marked something was happening within the sleepy trading town. Enemies of state were gathering there, Morian soldiers, leaders, generals. Names that struck fear in us, the very real reality that something much worse than a raiding party was heading down south. Along the river where there were snitches, I could track their movements. There was no mistake, Moria was coming.\n\nWe couldn’t defend, we could only run, leaving Wyck behind. We were in danger. An order was issued, the borders were closed and an emergency state was initiated. No one was allowed to enter our borders. We waited, and finally tiredness would overtake the Realm, but fear still tainted the dreams.\n\nThe next morning, we awoke. Everything, months of work was destroyed, looted, and reduced to rubble. War was declared. Nations closed their borders, restricting civilian travel. [Soon, nearly every power on the server was locked down.](http://imgur.com/a/CXcus)  \n\nAt this point, there was no turning back from this conflict. It had been brewing for months, and the pot had boiled over. We called our allies to war. The Eryndor Union.  Lakeheart Dominion. Arcestir. New Riviera. \n\nThey all joined united under our banner. We activated the Realmheart Alliance, and they were armed to the teeth and ready for blood. While Moria may have destroyed our aesthetics, and the obvious caches of supplies, we had enchanted gear, along with hundreds of potions, stuck in dropchests across the world, preventing all of our valuables from being compromised.\n\n Once Relamheart declared war, the opposing Omni-Alliance burst into action. They called in their allies, favors, and blackmail. Revolution State, Omnitopia, the Kuren Empire, and Nexus rallied against the Realmheart. Commanded by nation of Moria, but their real leader was the once-neutral, but now suddenly malicious Luni.  \n\tThe fighting was ready to break out. Besides the military mopping up a few attackers now and again, usually one-off probes, Moria was hesitant to draw first blood. The world hovered again, terrified and huddled behind locked doors, until the first major battle at Ameno. Gathering gear, brewing potions, and everything that we could use in a fight to fuel three units: archers, infantry, and cavalry. The cavalry was used to distract the enemy, while the infantry approached them. The Realmheart cavalry was headed by our best fighter and his friends, along with the occasional mercenary looking for a quick fight. Once the infantry arrived, however, the fighting began. \n\nI, as one of the infantry, started firing. One after another, I would hear a ding as I hit a enemy, they came at us in unprecedented numbers. Over and over, I would continue to draw and reload, draw and reload, hoping to aid and supplement the main damage, coming from the hand-to-hand combat.  \n\nEventually, however, I could do no more damage with a bow, and sprinted up to the front lines, and joining the Federation leader Blade, in taking on the man called Person, one of the top fighters of Moria. We bounced him back and forth, before he nearly killed me with a blow. I had to retreat away to heal, while Blade renewed his vicious strikes. Healing, I had the misfortune of being intercepted by Chopsy, one of the infamous soldiers of Moria. Cornered and unable to heal, we traded blows long and hard. It seemed I would perish in a few more untimed blows before an arrow sailed by my head, and punctured Chopsy’s armor.  \n\nThe man dissolved to the ground, kneeling over to leave behind his gear, which I took as a trophy of war.  My friend, an archer named Cath, had pearled one of the greatest menaces of the server, and let out a whoop as he checked his inventory to find Chopsy bound firmly inside. The fighting, however, was still long from over. It had spread out, with the Realmheart Alliance slowly forcing the Omni Alliance to retreat back. We recalled our own fighters back. One man had been lost, his fate to rest inside Luni’s vault until the end of the war. But that was a small price to pay for the five men we had captured and bound.  [One of the infantrymen would later reveal his video to the world, for propaganda purposes.  The first clip is one of the raids against Ameno, and the second is on the tail ends of the first battle.  It’s very loud, so turn down the volume.] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2SGa0H3slk&amp;nohtml5=False)\n\nOnly some would be released at the end of this costly war.\n\nWe had won the battle, but it was far from winning the war. A day of rest gave us a ticking clock before the next attack. We planned, and built small houses and defence. The next goal, since Moria had taken such heavy losses, was to take out the Omni-aligned Kuren Empire. Their leader, once a Morian general, had reprised the role, and was ready to take blood and bodies in defense of his new alliance and his former home.\n\nThat's it for part one.  I also have a video that beautifully showcases parts of the map, if you want it.  Thank you for reading!",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/4en3r8/dresden_files_rpg_the_quest_for_the_hellhound/",
        "text": "Recently I wrapped up a Dresden Files campaign and have had plenty of fun running it. While I have plenty of stories to tell from it I think this is the most noteworthy.  This is a story about a Hell Hound Corgi, or how Tim the Changeling embarked on his quest to acquire one.\n\nNow let me describe Tim. Tim’s a changeling, the child of a mortal and fae. In this instance Tim’s fae heritage comes from a fetch, a rather sneaky beaky type of fae. While he is sneaky beaky he’s also rather happy go lucky and is interested in making friends with any kind of creature that can talk. He also lives with another PC, a mundane mortal by the name of Jackson.\n\nEarly in the campaign he went to the Nevernever where he ended up ‘befriending’ (in the loosest sense) a fae cheese maker. The cheese maker made his cheese from hippocampus milk and Tim managed to get his hands on some cheese after the fae gave it to him and told him to scram. Tim ate the cheese and, like all faerie food, got addicted to it. So he went back to his home and proceeded to chat with Jackson.\n\nTim: “Hey Jackson…can we get a hippocampus?”\n\nJackson: “Why do you want one?”\n\nTim: “I want to make cheese!”\n\nJackson: “…If you can get me a hellhound corgi then you can have a hippocampus.”\n\nJackson thought that it would be an impossible request. He thought a hellhound corgi surely doesn’t exist. Thus Tim’s quest to get a hellhound corgi began. As the campaign progressed Tim used his web of contacts to try and figure out where to get a hellhound corgi. He ended up learning about a fae by the name of the Leanan Sidhe, or Lea for short. Now Lea a fae who has a love for hunting hounds, specifically hellhounds.\n\nNow I want to point out real quick something that happened during the campaign. Because of Tim’s actions of trying to befriend everything Jackson kicks him out of his house in fear of that Tim is going to do something and bring something really big and nasty back. Tim wanders about before getting himself an apartment.\n\nSo as the campaign progresses the party makes a rather shaky friendship/alliance with Artur, a black court vampire (think along the lines of Dracula) who works for the Order of the Dragon. Artur’s a decent mage and Tim, realizing this, goes up to Artur and asks him if he can summon Lea. Artur takes this as an opportunity to teach his apprentice of why you should never make a deal with the fae.\n\nTim’s taken out to a small outdoor shed and Artur draws up a summoning circle and summons Lea.\n\nTim: “I would like to make a deal with you. I want a hell hound corgi!”\n\nLea: “Do you? Then I shall need a trade.”\n\nHe offers her an enchanted coat he acquired and then this happens.\n\nMe: “You’re standing there when all of a sudden you find yourself closer to the ground.”\n\nTim(OOC): *has a confused look on his face* “Is she smaller?”\n\nMe: “No. She’s bigger than you. Everything is bigger than you.”\n\nTim: “What happened? Why am I small?”\n\nMe: “As you say this your words come out in a bark.”\nAt this point you can see that the realization has fallen upon him. She turned him into a hellhound corgi. Two of the players at the table are nodding their heads and going “I knew this was going to happen.” Another one sat there slack jawed that this actually happened and Jackson’s player was sprawled out on the couch losing it.\n\nI decided to be nice and have Artur step in and trade some knowledge with her to revert Tim back to his normal form. Once back to his regular form Tim’s standing there not pleased. After another player suggests he words his request differently he asks for it and trades her some books he found in a mages study. With the deal complete she tells him he’ll find the hellhound corgi soon. \n\nTim (OOC): “I feel cheated.”\n\nMe: “Well…you’re dealt with the fae. They will twist and turn your requests to their benefit.”\n\nTim leaves and returns to his home. The next morning, he finds this coal-black corgi sitting on top of him, licking his face happily. Excited he calls Jackson and tells him to get over to his apartment because he has the hellhound. Jackson arrives and is bewildered because Tim’s standing there with the hellhound corgi. He takes the hellhound corgi and is standing there with this look of “How…what..why?”.\n\nTim: “So can I come back now that I got you the corgi?”\n\nJackson: “..No. Our deal was that if you got me the corgi you can have a hippocampus. But you’re now living on your own you could have gotten a hippocampus regardless. Thanks for the corgi.”\n\nAt this point Jackson turns around and leaves with the corgi. And poor Tim never got his hippocampus.\n",

The rest of the party joined and the beast was slain. Then we each took a trophy and rested, and Rick told us about his new character. He had trained under a renowned Paladin/Monk who had later become a Blackguard, renouncing their god and killing almost everyone in their monastery. He had spared Rick, but now our new ally was hunting him down. He wanted his former mentor to atone, but would settle for his death. He laid hands on us as he told his tale, healing us and using detect alignment on Sam and Dan. He let us know he would check me and Jill when he could. The betrayal by his master had left him a bit paranoid. \n\nOoC, Rick had planned this brilliantly. He apparently had worked on this Paladin since he found out the bow was cursed, crafting him to have reasons this guy might turn up the Ranger's killer without having to directly look for them. He had seen mistrust in our group and assumed there was a reason.\n\nThe DM passed him a note listing the alignments he'd checked, and Rick chuckled, then handed it back. I was curious what had happened, and wondered why he'd picked those two. \n\nWe got back to town and reported to the mayor. Kerg was proud to give his trophy to the mayor, a symbol to show the people they were safe from the beast. Then he sent us off to the capitol of the kingdom. The king had a task for us. \n\nWe spent that night in the town, each doing our own tasks and preparing for the journey ahead, though the Paladin got his hands on me and Jill first. The DM passed the note, we waited, and the note went back. \n\n\"So? Learn anything interesting?\" Sam asked. \n\n\"Well, one of you is lying to the group, but it's not my place to say who.\"\n\nInside, I panicked. He wasn't talking about me. Kerg was every bit the true neutral I claimed. So who was our liar? Was I the only one working against us? Or had I been blind? I glanced at the others. Sam was watching Dan, who was looking at an equipment list. Jill was looking as confused as me. Rick was busy writing something on his character sheet. And the DM was waiting. \n\nWe each took our turn with him, explaining how we spent our final night in the starter town. \n\n\"I need to make sure Dan can never come back here. I'm going to disguise myself as him and make sure Sam sees me up to no good. Maybe rob a few things and plant evidence. Then I'll lose him in the sewers, change back, and check in with the mayor one last time.\"\n\nDM had me make a few rolls, many of which were just to oppose Sam's later rolls. Then it was Dan's turn, and finally, Sam went in. Shortly after, the DM called in Jill, asked her to have Dan to make a few rolls, and she reported back. Well played on his part. \n\nSam was more proactive than I expected, deciding after a time to confront \"Dan\" and end this. The DM ruled that as he approached, my character would just do his sewer escape early. And it succeeded, thankfully. But now I was ready for a blow out when we regrouped. \n\nWe gathered at the city gate, and Dan was last to show, some barmaid in tow to kiss him goodbye. When Sam made his accusation, she claimed Dan was with her all night. \n\nSam: Not to sound cliché, but we'd like a look in your bag. \n\nDan: No way. I don't trust you. \n\nJill: Who would you trust?\n\nMe: We have a pally who—\n\nRick: thinks we are wasting time with petty infighting. Let's get to the king and deal with bigger problems. \n\nSam wasn't happy, but Jill and I went with Rick's plan, so we headed out. I was a little let down, but now they were all a little paranoid. Jill was clearly torn, not sure what she'd seen when she was called in on Sam's turn. Dan and Sam both thought the other was at fault. Rick was paranoid before this, but I had no idea what he was thinking, though I was pretty sure he didn't blame me or Jill. I'd have to find a way to learn Sam's and Dan's alignments. ",

        "text": "Continuing the adventure of my friends and I learning to play D&amp;D the story picks back up with two players, one playing a monk, the other playing a rogue. The monk's player is still more or less along for the ride and the rogue's player still thinks this should play like a video game. Coming in later on are a druid played by a new player that also more or less along for the ride and a bard played by someone with years of experience that's capable of roleplaying and not whining when things don't go his way.\n\nThe rogue and the monk wake up in or about the inn they stayed at the night previously and are sent to go secure the rumored to be haunted estate. The estate is a brief walk north of town during which the party passes a number of people carrying hides towards a rather smelly building which is promptly ignored in favor of getting up the road. An unenventful jaunt later the party arrives at the outer wall of the estate and is greeted by a stone wall with a gap where the gate would have been and a path that seems to lead around to the back. The rogue decides to ignore the path in favor of the front door and the party is greeted by Jeeves, the estate's butler, who addresses the monk as \"Young Master\" and informs him that he has guests waiting in the ballroom and that his grandfather is in his room, having another one of his episodes. The party also sees the wall behind Jeeves as he is very assumably a ghost of some sort.\n\nThe party asks Jeeves to lead them to the ballroom where they open the doors to see several corpses on the floor. Taking a step into the room they see the shields and spears on those corpses float up and take a defensive pose. The rogue says they should burn the place down, the monk replies that this is where they're supposed to be setting up shop and they close the doors to the ballroom and ask to be led to see grandfather instead. Opening the door to grandfather's room they see all sorts of weapons that appear to be fighting one another before a pair of longswords move slightly outwards and all the other weapons crash to the floor in a circle around the small room. The rogue restates his desire to burn the place down and heads back for the front door. Outside the rogue sees some saddles float around the side of the building and decides inside might be a better option than outside and heads back up with the monk. The rogue then talks to Jeeves for a bit, asking him to get him some water. Jeeves floats off toward the far end of the manor, out of visual range.\n\nThe rogue, whose player thought he was fighting the large number of opponents in the ballroom, uses thunderwave from just inside the door on the pair of floating longswords, doing a decent bit of damage and throwing all the weapons on the floor to the back of the room to start combat. The longswords take one attack on each of the party members, missing both of them, and the monk and rogue both attack the swords. The rogue misses and takes some damage from the swords' riposte but then lands a critical hit and sends one of the swords falling to the ground. The singular sword makes an attack on the rogue and points to the monk, causing an axe on the floor to throw itself at him. The axe missed its attack, stopping midair in the doorway the monk was standing just outside of, and falling to the ground. Some basic fighting later the rogue lands the killing blow and opts to kill the remaining sword by stabbing it into the wall, where it quivers then dissipates, along with the rest of the weapons in the room.\n\nFighting finished, Jeeves returns with an empty cup.  An actual empty cup, which he gives to the rogue because he asked for water. The rogue's player is a little freaked out and the rogue, trying to get rid of Jeeves, tells him to go cut the grass. Jeeves lets the rogue know that they have gardeners for that. The rogue's player is getting pissy at this point and going to be mean to yet another NPC for not immediately giving him what he wants. The rogue sternly commands Jeeves to go cut the grass and Jeeves has had enough of his shit and lets him know in no uncertain terms that the rogue is not his master and that it is the gardeners' job. The rogue stabs Jeeves, to no effect. The rogue's player asks me if I'm sure it has no effect even with his enchanted sword and when told nothing happens suggests, yet again, that they just burn the place down. The monk asks him if he knows he's dead and Jeeves responds that he's not. The monk tells Jeeves that he is in fact dead, rolls low on persuasion, and Jeeves remains unconvinced. The rogue, in a condescending tone, tells Jeeves that he just stabbed him and he's dead. When asked to roll persuasion the rogue's player announces that he's proficient in deception. He's not trying to decieve anyone and he's also proficient in persuasion so he pretty easily makes the roll, convincing Jeeves that he is, in fact dead. Jeeves, now aware that he's dead, fails to vanish like the rogue's player had hoped so he's sent to get the rogue some food while the party goes back to the ballroom.\n\nThe rogue opens combat yet again with a thunderwave, taking one of the shields clean out of the fight and damaging everything else. The map had a natural chokepoint 10 ft wide, the monk stood back from that hoping to only have to face two things at a time. The rogue, attacked after casting his spell, ran back out the doorway, allowing the monk to become surrounded. The party heard a set of loud thuds coming from somewhere in the ballroom. A few rounds of combat and a couple dissipated hostile combinations later the party hears wood cracking and sees a warhammer float out from a part of the room they haven't seen yet. The monk takes some decent damage and runs for the far end of the hall, a dead end, to try to put space between him and the hostiles and give him time to use a healer's kit on himself. The rogue heads that way also and the party manages to take out all the weapons. \n\nFighting finished they head into one of the smaller dressing rooms off of the ballroom and the monk finds a hidden doorway. After the rogue checks it for traps the monk opens it and heads in to see a narrow corridor down the side of the ballroom. At the far end the rogue decides he needs to use his mage hand and pulls another door open to a room full of empty bookshelves and ruined furniture with one visible closed door leading out. The next room is empty and has one more closed door leading out. At this point the players are confused as to where they are, the monk's player not sure if they might be in some extradimensional space, and the rogue's player wanting a map and also to burn the place down. They head through that door into a dining room and are once again greeted by Jeeves who presents the rogue with an empty bowl. The rogue's player is still not happy with Jeeves and the rogue decides to wear the bowl as a hat. The monk realizes that they can just follow Jeeves and asks him for a cup of water, following him through another hidden doorway and through a passageway to the manor's kitchen where he grabs yet another wooden cup and attempts to pour from a broken ceramic jug, handing the monk the empty cup. \n\nThe party takes the opportunity of being presented with a doorway out of the house and exits to the rear of the manor where they see a stable collapsing in on itself and a stone structure with metal doors with no visible knobs. The monk breaks the door open, causing the rusted metal latch to fall out onto the floor, and the party heads down a set of stairs. Thirty or so feet in they see the first set of tombs, one right and one left, with worn scupltures of vaguely evlish persons on their lids. They also see on the floor where the lid on one of the tombs looked to have been slid off, though it was now back on the tomb. The next set saw one tomb partially open with only skeletal remains inside. The rogue, without touching anything, determined that this person likely died of old age (with a decent medicine check). The rogue then decided it was a great time to leave because there were probably zombies or something and it was almost getting dark out so the party went back to town.\n\nBack in town the rogue tells the scribe NPC, Dingo, that they think they've cleared everything out of the house but they're not going back without a paladin or a cleric. Dingo says that it's great that they've cleared the manor and that it'll be nice to move out there. The rogue replies condescendingly that he can go if he wants to but the party isn't going back out there without a paladin or a cleric. Dingo says ok and heads out of the tavern/inn. The party goes to stop him outside the inn and Dingo tells them he's on his way to order some furniture and maybe some help. They follow and make their way to a house where they enter to see their commanding officer, David Brightwall. They also see a decorative set of leather armor with a red dragon wrapped around a green tree, the symbol of Duskwood, the nation they're currently in. The rogue's player asks if it's for him and if it's magical and David begins to put it on. The rogue's player is confused at this point and says \"but he's an officer in the other army\" I reply in character as David, \"Ah, but I am David Brightwall, Captain of the Third Legion of the Glorious Army of Duskwood.\" The rogue's player is now broadcasting stream of thought very much out of character and it bounces along but there are surely spies in that camp we were in before that would have seen him and how can he be an officer in both armies. \"It's a wonderful position to be in,\" David replies, \"Having both sides thinking you're spying on the other for them.\" The rogue's player is still unhappy with the idea of this guy being in both armies but manages to remember why he came and tells David what happened and that they're not going back without a paladin or a cleric and the only paladin he knows is another person in David's group. David responds that that person is far away and the church doesn't have many people up this far but he'll see what he can do. The rogue goes to the tannery to find the tanner still there but the leatherworker gone home for the day. The monk heads back to the tavern to find that everyone is staring at him and specifically at the things that mark him as a monk. Monk has Dingo ask around, finds out that his order are a kind of bogeymen here, stealing wives, eating children, that sort of thing. Next day rogue goes to get some upgraded armor, gets a quote of 40g using components of his current leather armor to fashion some studded leather armor, offers 20g plus this small opal he found (I told the player to talk to me about the value of it when they weren't somewhere without light, he never did, opals are worth 1000g). The rogue's player looked upset that he didn't even have to roll persuasion and the rogue recieved a set of studded leather armor that evening. The rogue's player refused to do anything else until they had a paladin or a cleric and it was getting late so the session ended.\n\nThe next session started with the party at the inn and the new additions arriving at the inn together as the help that David could provide. Some introductions later Dingo shoes them out to go deal with the manor because he has furniture on the way and the rogue only complains a little about not getting a cleric or paladin. Everyone gets maps of what the party had seen previously because the rogue's player was going to be incredibly confused otherwise (he was still confused because it wasn't a full map that he could metagame off of) and the party makes their way to the estate where they see three horses tied to bits of broken fence near the entrance. The bard waits at the gate to try to social anything that comes out, the party heads across the 70 feet or so to the front of the building where some of them hear fighting going on inside. The party regroups under some windows that the rogue looks through to see 18 people, 15 rank and file with spears and shields and 3 sergeants with warhammers, fighting a pair of longswords. The bard looks in to see 14 rank and file and 3 sergeants fighting a pair of longswords that fight as if they were being held by one person. He ok's it with the party to offer to help them and breaks out enough of a window to be noticed and offers help to the 13 rank and file and 3 sergeants who gladly accept. Going inside Jeeves informs the monk that they have guests waiting in the chapel and that the monk's grandfather is currently entertaining them.\n\nThe party follows Jeeves to the chapel where they find 12 rank and file and 3 sergeants fighting a pair of longswords. Bard casts faerie fire hoping to reveal some unseen wielder, which it does not, but the player leaves it up to give everyone advantage on attacking the longswords. The longswords enjoy advantage attacking the guys with spears because of how close everything was to it. The rogue heads around the formation of soldiers and engages the longswords in melee to start combat. The rogue hits with his first strike, doing a little bit of damage, though none visible, to the swords. His second attack misses and the swords riposte for 18 of his 27 hp. The monk heads around the side of the formation but doesn't get close enough to attack this turn. Grandfather misses a strike against the rogue and drops one of the soldiers stabbing him through the throat. The bard mocks the swords which don't hear him and the druid heads around the other side but she didn't pick spells that won't cause all the non-hostile soldiers to also take damage so she holds off on doing anything else. The rogue disengages and heads away from the swords, drawing a shooting an arrow where the wielder would be if there were one, hitting one of the soldiers in the shoulder (The rogue's player was confused when I had him roll damage when he rolled a natural 1. I don't like to run with critical failures having negative consequences but gun safety says always know what's behind your target). Eventually one sword goes down and poofs and two turns later a spear comes up to replace it. Rogue re-engages after some healing and one of the other spears throws itself, barely knicking the bard. Another soldier goes down and the rogue gets the final blow, swinging at the sword with the spear blocking his attack, smashing both in half, the sword falling and poofing.\n\nThe bard talks with one of the sergeants a little, the sergeant acknowledges the monk as the person they were told to wait for, and tells the bard that they're here to secure the place, last patrol sent to do so was 50 years ago as the outer regions don't see much of the legions. The rogue tells them they have orders from David (who it takes the sergeant a minute to come up with a name for because not his captain) to secure the place which the sergeant acknowledges and sees as his way out of having to deal with more of this stuff, telling the rogue that they'll leave him to it and yelling to his people that they're leaving. The rogue then tells the sergeant that they need to go clear out the crypt which the sergeant tells the rogue was not part of his orders. The rogue's player gets pissy again and the rogue tells the sergeant that David's orders were to clear the crypt. The sergeant matches his tone and tells him not his commander, not his orders. The rogue's player starts to whine that he has deception and I flat out tell him that he's not going to get people to think something they know to be expressly false. Bard's player backs me up on this and says with military chain of command those people would probably get in trouble for taking orders from another commander. I've since learned that the rogue's player thinks that I was suprised and dumbfounded by him doing that. I was improvising the whole thing because I was expecting the PCs to be on the other side of that fight but it was the rogue saying the party had orders to secure the place rather than saying that the party had orders to assist the army unit that made that conversation play out the way it did.\n\nEveryone fails to identify what deity the broken, dirty stained glass windows might represent, druid notes that this region primarily worships Pelor, and a cleric familiar to monk and rogue appears. Rogue rather bluntly asks who he is, cleric replies that that would be telling. Bard has been rolling kinda crappy on religion since he walked into this chapel and figures that Pelor sometimes presents as a half-elven male, shows deference and asks how he may serve. If someone asks if you're a god you say yes. Cleric motions to the rogue, says to \"Do good and let him see.\" Monk asks a similar question in Celestial, gets a similar answer. Cleric swirls out of existance, bard doesn't spot anything magical in the room that might have caused the floating swords.\n\nThe party heads up some stairs, through a room, into a passageway, down some stairs, and through a couple more rooms to get back to where they started, thoroughly confused because I was still the only person at the table with a complete map. At this point they've talked to Jeeves and figured out the more important bits of history and that the father was buried in the crypt, so they head out back to the crypt. The rogue's player was unhappy at a joke made at his expense (we're all friends, this was good natured ribbing rather than the usual shit he talks about the rest of us when he thinks we won't hear or be told) so the rogue cast firebolt and lit the stable on fire.\n\nThe monk notices that the latch that had fallen out of the door is now significantly further into the crypt than it had been so the rogue sneaks down to see what's there. He sees one man pulling sideways on the lid of a tomb and safely assumes there's a second at the other end also helping and returns unseen to tell the party. The players then ask me if they can have taken a short rest and I say they were moving pretty consistently so they haven't and that they hear the thud of stone hitting stone from the crypt. The party heads down into the crypt, the bard goes slightly ahead, uses command on the person the rogue saw that he can now see, and has him come over to tell him what he's doing. The graverobber isn't immediately hostile thanks to the command spell and accepts the bard's story and allows him to go help them. I take a stealth check for the rest of the party attempting to hide, monk and druid roll poorly rogue rolls well, and I tell them they do their best to hide behind the directional cover of the walls, tombs, and dropped stone lids in the area they're hiding in (we're on a drawn map at this point because this can become combat). The rogue's player is unhappy with this and asks what he's doing because he rolled an 18, turns out he's also doing exactly that.\n\nThe bard pretends to help and when the lid slides off he discreetly casts minor illusion causing a blue flaming skull to rise from the tomb, scaring the two graverobbers he was with, sending them running. Someone from further down hears the commotion and yells that they were here first and to piss off before popping out to see the blue flaming skull floating near the bard. The graverobber that came out is immediately scared and asks the bard if he can keep it back, the bard convincingly performs to be holding it back, and the remaining 6 graverobbers are called to run out and do so quickly, not caring even if they notice the rest of the party. The rogue's player asks if he can try to pickpocket one of them and I tell him he can if he wants to run after the guy because the guy is most definitely running, rogue's player declines. Party attempts to replace the lid on one of the tombs, fails the strength check, and drops it, cracking it in half. Good deeds failed, the party continues inward.\n\nThe main hallway of the tomb takes a 90 degree turn to the right and the rogue stealths on ahead to the first set of alcoves. The main way through the crypt is 10' across and has 15'x15' alcoves set on either side of it with 10' of hallway between alcoves. The rogue advances, the figures on the tombs becoming clearer as he goes, checking for traps or anything worth seeing as he goes. A couple sets of alcoves in he can finally see a smaller tomb centered at the end of the crypt. He continues advancing to the edge of each alcove in turn until he is standing at the start of the last set of alcoves with the small tomb centered not more than 10 feet ahead of him asking each time if he sees any traps or entities and the last time I have him roll perception, and he fails to notice the specter of Father which comes up behind him and places a cold hand on his shoulder, failing the advantaged attack roll. Rogue responds by slashing through father with his shortsword and father wails loudly, alerting the party and starting initiative. Party has to spend an entire turn to get close enough to see father, who appears to be casting shadows in the darkness. Bard identifies that these are all separate entities and the three entities surround and attack the rogue. Father and one shadow miss, the second shadow deals some damage and saps some of the rogue's strength. Rogue hits the shadow that managed to hit him, monk closes and does the same, bard mocks the shadow which is visibly upset, and the druid wills a patch of dirt in the hallway to grow a vine which wraps itself around the neck of the shadow and pulls it towards her and down, where it dissipates. Bard's player asks if that spell actually knocks things prone, I tell him it doesn't, it just happened to kill that one. Rogue takes a hit from both father and shadow, dropping some strength and some maximum hp, and decides that this is a great time to disengage and go hide. Monk squares up against the remaining shadow, bard mocks father, shadow heads around monk to also be engaging druid and misses its attack on monk, father heads through the wall chasing rogue and leaves rogue with 3hp and 18 maximum. Father is dispatched via mockery, the details of which cause a spectral pile of poo to form and crush it (spiritual entity dying to psychic damage, it caught the player offguard but seemed fitting to make it die in relation to the insult thrown). Druid grows a vine out of her shield which grabs shadow point blank and (per the rules of pulling 10' towards you and the shadow being non-collideable) pulls it causing it to go through her into the space in the alcove behind her. Monk's player opts to let me tell him how he killed the remaining shadow, monk planting a hand on a sculpted, familiar pair of crossed longswords drives his quarterstaff into the shadow and swings up then down until the shadow dissipates. Bard heals rogue, monk inspects tomb, top of tomb is sculpted as a baby with a necklace similar to the one monk has, he'll have to get on top of it to read it. Monk is now stuck to the tomb, bard's player is excited because he know OOC that it's a mimic (and thanks to a decent roll IC as well), rogue's player is unhappy that I moved his piece on the map next to the bard that just healed him. Monk eventually breaks free and runs back, rogue spams magic missle the whole fight, bard continually mocks the thing, druid waits until monk is clear and casts moonbeam, causing the mimic to lose form. Rogue opts to have the mimic explode via magic missle when he kills it and mimic explodes with a shower of gold coins. Party also gets a potion of healing, a scroll (yet to be identified), and what appears to be an inside out burlap sack (also yet to be identified).\n\nInspecting the crypt the party has noticed that the walls behind the tombs have figures of women sculpted/carved on them. Rogue looking past the tomb carved in a figure similar to the spectre they just fought sees a woman and hears a voice in the back of his head telling him to see, fails a wisdom save,  and fades to black. Rogue's consciousness opens his eyes to see her, a woman that he recognizes as his wife, staring back at him before he stabs her repeatedly. He hears children crying in the background and runs away. Coming back to reality he freaks out and runs out of the tomb, the monk runs out catch him to keep him from doing anything stupid. \n\nParty hears a commotion from the front of the manor, bard sneaks up to see, comes back to tell party it's just Dingo. Furniture got there and Dingo had them come out and start unloading it. Rogue gives Dingo shit for coming out without them telling him it was safe but says it should be safe now. Workers have been unloading furniture for half an hour at this point because the party took a short rest after dealing with the graverobbers.\n\nParty splits up, rogue and druid stay outside in front of the house because rogue's player isn't going to be in another fight until he's had a long rest and druid's player doesn't want to leave him alone in case there's a fight. Monk and bard head into the house, ask Jeeves to show them any rooms they might not have been in, he shows them a handful of empty rooms and says that's it except the servant's quarters, which they have him show them. One room of the 8 in the servants quarters won't open when they try, monk forces it and is met with the smell of old decaying body. They ask Jeeves who at this point is following them around to answer questions and determine that it's his room. Bard points out that he's dead in there and Jeeves replies, \"Oh, I should really clean me up.\" Monk asks if he wants to be buried, Jeeves is indifferent but notes that it would probably cut down on the smell a bit. They then find one more door in the servants passage nailed shut, and the monk fails his strength check to open it. This is where I realized that we'd split the party into team crowbar and team not-crowbar and that team crowbar was sitting on the front steps. We swapped back to team crowbar who decided to check the room off the chapel, finding an empty room with a sunburst carved into the wall. The rogue touched it, it was carved wood. The druid touched it, it was carved wood. The crowbar status of the teams swapped and the monk and bard went back up to open the door, finding the nursery and seeing a crib with what appeared to be a baby in it. The baby was a doll and was wearing a carved wooden necklace, this one with a name not belonging to the monk. The monk asked Jeeves if there were many children in his line, Jeeves replied that yes, his father had been a child, and his grandfather before that to name a couple (Jeeves knows things but has to be asked in the correct manner). The monk asked how many children his father had, 3, him, his brother, and his sister. Brother and sister left with their mother after father had been buried. Went to Camelyn, the city the party started off near.\n\nSession wrapped up at this point, players were given the complete map, everyone that had to be at work in the morning was tired as hell. Only encounter that went the way I thought it would was the mimic fight. I'd grown so used to the party fighting as a means of problem solving that the added player running a character that was both needless killing averse (chaotic good) and socially competent (bard) while also being an experienced player made for an interesting session but took out the more cinematic reveal I'd planned for the spectre and shadows. I hope that the addition of the bard's player will help the rogue's player improve. I've certainly been shown a few areas I can improve my DMing.",

        "text": "First I would like to say that suicide is not an answer and me as well as the party do not normally find suicide funny. This story happened to my 5e D&amp;D group, the characters that witness the glorious even were: a human wizard (with his snake familiar and his 9 AC), level 3, a very charismatic human Rouge level 3, a Gnome fighter tank (19 AC) level 2, a human fighter level 2, a tiefling ranger level 2, my character a human ranger (hunter) level 3, a DMPC named Kathrin and our DM. The games setting is in a European type area but the era is similar to the industrial revolution, our group of wannabe adventurers found a creepy town in the middle of the mountains (DM told us it had creepy rumours about it) but we find a group of tiefling inhabiting the Fort in the centre. Our wizard was badly hurt after we killed a bunch of Griffins (DM has a rule about getting knocked unconscious in battle means getting a wound the cannot be cured by magic but by doctors) so the tieflings patch up our wizard and they want us to go look for a merchant that normally trades with them. We accepted and we head out, we fined his cart (wrecked) but tracks leading into the forest. We follow the tracks until we hit a river, we then try to find the tracks again and the PC fail. Then Kathrin rolls high enough for us to find the trail. We find the trail goes to a cave with big bush next to one side, I decide to see if there is anything behind it, fail, we proceed forward until. We run into two goblins (I believe they were bugbears but they could also be hobgoblins) and they are behind the big bush on the other side of the river. We then proceed to fail most of our attacks at the goblins, then Kathrin proceed to shoot her automatic crossbow and hit almost all of them. The wizard uses crown of madness on one and the crowned goblin kills the other one, then we kill it. We go into the cave and kill four goblins in a sneak attack, we send the snake to go look for the merchant and we find him in a part of a cave. There was another path so we decide to see where the other path went, we saw two goblins and a dam. We take one goblin out but the other goblin breaks the dam and we have to make a strength check. The goblin, the snake and the wizard make the save (the wizard has a negative in strength) and the rest of the party is washed away. The goblin and the wizard are close to each other, I will punch the goblin (ooc). DM if you hit the goblin you will kill it, rolls more then enough to hit the goblin and kills it. The group is laughing at what happened as our characters dry off a bit before heading back to the cave and finding five more goblins guarding the merchant, we proceed to kill them. We checked to see if the merchant is alive, my character heals him with cure wounds. We check to see if there is more beyond the dam (we left Kathrin to look after the merchant), there is a light the shows a branching path beyond a second dam. We proceed stealthily to the area and we turn the corner to find, a dead goblin. (Ooc) what? My character goes up to see what happened to the body, rolls a 1. It's suicide (the DM says to us that the entry point was in his back), the human fighter decides that he is going to check, rolls a 1. Yep, it's a suicide. (Ooc) we are laughing our asses off). We find some good loot but before anything else happens, we hear Kathrin scream. We run to find Kathrin and the merchant next to each other, we check to see if they are alive and they are (we also joked that they also tried to commit suicide). We turn to find a robot type thing standing at the entrance of the room, we proceed to attack it and most of our hits miss and we realize that  The robot then proceed to attack our wizard and the other ranger, then during the rouges turn someone jokes about seducing the robot. She rolls to seduce. Natural 20. (Ooc) laughing so hard. DM \"The robot goes bright red.\" Oh shit we all back away even the rouge and I move over both the merchant and Kathrin to try and shield them. The robot then brings out a heated sword from its arm and jumps to my ranger and stab me. We then bring the robot robot down but the wizard goes down and gets a festering wound (Since I was the only one with healing spells and had just used up the last of the spells on the robot we took a short rest). After the merchant and Kathrin woke up and I proceed to remove the festering wound from our wizard (DM said magic could remove the disease from the wound). We tried to check to see if there was anything useful in the robot, we all failed our checks. We proce to go back to town with the merchant paying me to carry the robot.",

        "text": "Original post [here,](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/4ce2ux/jesus_plays_pathfinder_nongreentext_edition/) greentext version of this update [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDGreentext/comments/4ehr0x/jesus_plays_pathfinder_part_15/)\n\nThis is unfortunately a rather boring installment in the sure-to-be epic saga of playing as the Son of God. But if Jesus can deliver us from evil, OP can deliver an update when he says he’ll update, even if it’s not action-packed. \n\nTo help soften the blow, [here’s a crappy sketch I did of my character.](http://i.imgur.com/NPK5CSwh.jpg)\n\nI was scheduled this week to take part in an indie film as a lead in a [Captain Planet parody](https://www.facebook.com/The-Planetars-375549235864830/?fref=ts), so I wasn’t able to do a full session with the previously mentioned crew. I was, however, able to at least meet up with the DM and Orcbro before I had to go, and was able to plant some interesting seeds for next time. \n\nFor Orcbro, I had [this present](http://i.imgur.com/6SMUL3jh.jpg). Within the scroll was “The Ideals of Gabbatha Zuss.”\n\nYes, I made ten. \n\nNo, no one noticed. \n\nI had the idea that these commandments wouldn’t just apply to a Jesus-expy in the world of Pathfinder, but also as a “don’t be a dick” guide for tabletop players in general. You know, respect the DM’s choices. Don’t complain about bad rolls. Don’t metagame. Considering that if you think about it, Jesus was basically our world’s DMPC, the changes seemed appropriate:\n\n&gt; **I. Honor and respect the forces that direct the universe, especially the Master Of All.**\n\n&gt; **II. Give to other people what you hope to receive in return.**\n\n&gt; **III. Fulfillment and joy are better than power and riches.**\n\n&gt; **IV. Serve others instead of yourself, and you will be rewarded.**\n\n&gt; **V. Do not lie about your fortune—accept it and make use of it.**\n\n&gt; **VI. Do not sacrifice the essence of yourself for temporary gain.**\n\n&gt; **VII. Pray often for your own guidance, but do not concern yourself with spying on others.**\n\n&gt; **VIII. Be grateful for what life gives you—everything is a unique experience that can be treasured.**\n\n&gt; **IX. Make peace with your friends and love them—enemies are common, but allies are rare.**\n\n&gt; **X. Remember, life is a game with no true winners—don’t try to beat it or break it.**\n\nWhen he was done reading, Orcbro closed the scroll and said with a sigh, “Our characters are going to butt heads so much.”\n\nI smiled and shrugged apologetically, but in my head, a small, persistent thought echoed. Orcbro’s character is the one most opposed to my own, but the player is closest to me in real life. We’re going to continue interacting ingame, no matter what. And with our opposite philosophies, one of our characters is going to break. \n\nAnd it ain’t going to be the guy who turned down bread after 40 days in the desert. \n\nIt’s the hardest, and the most fulfilling roleplay mission I can give myself. On this orc I will build my church, I thought, grinning. Or die trying. \n\n***\n\nAfter our conversation was done, the DM asked me for the character sheet and my character’s motivations so that he could puppeteer him during the day’s encounters. I used every synonym for “evangelist” and “savior” that I could when describing Zuss. \n\nThe DM took another look at my sheet and saw that I had gone with Sarenrae as a patron god. (She seemed like the most in line with what I was after, with her themes of light and healing.) The DM assumed, however, that I was after the sun-and-violence aspects, and offered to switch out my layout so I could deal the most damage. I said thanks, but I was pretty happy with the simple layout I had.\n\nThe DM looked confused. Frightened, even. He asked me several times if I was sure I didn’t want any magic items for my character to start off with, before he eventually decided that I had simply forgotten to write them down, and that I would tell him my requests next week. \n\nHere was a man who was so used to players demanding loot and nothing else from a quest, that he thought he was being a bad DM by not filling my pockets with imaginary gold. \n\nI felt bad for him. \n\nMore importantly, though, I realized that there was a slim chance that I could help him. \n\nG. Zuss started off as a joke character. But today, I realized that he could potentially be something more. \n\nWhat would happen if, in a group of minmaxers and murderhobos, a single player chose to commit solely to roleplay? What if a character wasn’t there to win, but to take care of the other players? Would it confuse them? Would it frustrate them? …Or would it eventually change them?\n\nOver the next weeks, I intend to find out. ...And very likely, die trying. \n\n**“G. Zuss saves Pathfinder:” full-sized update in two weeks.**\n\nIn the meantime: Should I show the sketch to the group? Do I need to get off my high horse and keep G. Zuss as a joke character? Do you have any suggestions for how to help my intimidated DM? And which magic items should I request of God to help in my mission?\n\n##[Part 2 here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/4glsy6/jesus_plays_pathfinder_part_2/)",

        "text": "So in my campaign two of our guys were gone, so I invited a different mate and we played outside game. The side game takes place in the same world as the canon one, but we just follow a bunch of murder hobo mercenaries, as they go from mission to mission.\n\nOne of these missions took them to the Kingdom of Eleena. If you read my [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3q8uyj/how_a_random_enemy_changed_the_worlds_history/) of this subreddit I mentioend the Gold Sea, a giant desert in the center of the continent. For context, Eleena is North West of the desert over the mountains that near completely enclose it. It is a peninsula that stretches south west into the sea. With only the “High Castle Mountains” and the frozen lands of Aragmaar on its border. Directly across the sea to the south of them is Dorchmad,  and southwest is the Island of Liecron which has human colonies on it, but is mostly dominated by wood elves.\n\nPolitically, Eleena is run by the High Priest and High Priestess, who rule in the stead of the true king, Kathun the Thunder Lord. Kathun isn’t just a king though, he is the god of loyalty, warriors, subjugation, strength. During the “Second God War,” and the current pantheons were forming, Kathun stood alone with his wife Moldra, goddess of duty, childbearing, assimilation, power. He declared himself lord of humanity and all other gods were weak, unworthy of even rememberance.\n\nWhen the Second God War was over, he remained as strong as ever, though many gods still lived too. A bunch of stuff happened that I can’t say because the party hasn’t learned them yet, so no spoils. But basically he ended making the Thunder Codex, which is a pseudo holy book, instruction manual text he wrote on how to run the nation and how to train mighty warriors worthy of his blessing. Then declared he would go to the tallest mountain in Eleena, and he would reside there till either he is the only god worshiped, or his followers command an empire that stretches the world with no borders with any other. His people, forever devoted, set about this holy task given to them with great fervor.\n\nSo when our side party visited the nation to assassinate a noble who’s been getting a little too influential in the high court. First it started out pretty simple. Everyone has a necklace with the icon of a iron crown with lightning bolts coming off it. Our necromancer (MLG ranger from the canon game if you’re curious) started talking to the large number of spirits in the city, and learned they refused to move to the afterlife, in the hopes that even after death they might be able to help in some way with their great mission.\n\nThe city center is a 60 foot iron statue of Kathun with Moldra besides him. As a joke I depicted him as a 40k Space Marine, huge shoulder plates and armor, a massive sword with lightning surrounding it. A greathelm with the flat top being a crown with five tall points.\n\nTo get inside the castle where the lord was staying they told the guards there was an assassin after him and they needed to warn him. Deciding to continue with the space marine joke I had the first guard blow them off like it was nonsense, but the second mentioned the “Dropsite Massacre” and that they shouldn’t risk the assassin getting even a chance, which promptly changed the first guard’s mind.\n\nSo fully embracing the “totally not space marines” aspect of the kingdom I present to you the history of Eleena. Or as we call them “The Crusader Dicks.”\n\nShortly after Kathun left, the high clergy declared a war on Aragmaar to spread the word of Kathun to their immediate neighbor. Aragmaar being mostly a frozen waste is sparsely populated, with only the city state at its heart being the only real settlement of note. The Aragmaar army was easily defeated, but the siege is what truly saved them. With very little supplies for the impulse war, and winter on its way, Eleena was forced to retreat before even setting up basic earthworks around the city, or risk perishing in the harsh Aragmaar winter.\n\nEleena waited a generation to prepare. Within the Thunder Codex were the instructions on how to train the ultimate warriors, “These boys who give themselves to me, I shall make into men worthy of my protection. In great armor they shall be clad in, and the mightiest of weapons they will be armed. For they are my Thunder Warriors, and they shall know no fear.”\n\nThe second invasion of Aragmaar went much better then before. Properly prepared and supplied, the army accompanied by 100 of the first generation of thunder warriors. Marched once more on their northern neighbor. Aragmaar though had prepared for their return as well, and marched their new professional army to meet them, rather than the makeshift conscript force they had last time. Eleena suffered greatly during the battle after underestimating their enemy's combat abilities, but their right flank never faltered and as the center and left flank crumbled back, the thunder warriors wheeled around to smash into the enemy’s rear, trapping them between them and the fresh reserve troops. The battle tired soldiers of the enemy’s force finally routed and fled back to their city.\n\nFor three months they seiged the enemy before finally their siege works managed to break a hole into the ice wall that protected it. The Thunder Warriors lead the attack easily crushing the enemy defense and breaching the city. Inside though the city was empty, the populace's trail long since buried in snow. Declaring victory Eleena pulled out, knowing they couldn’t chase down the population to secure a true victory before winter came.\n\nThe High Clergy spoke and agreed that Aragmaar simply is too difficult to to conquer for the resources they possess, and agree that a different target should be chosen instead. As Aragmaar was no threat to them, and they could return to conquering it at a later date. They instead choose Dorchmad to the south would make an appropriate target, and act as a strong beachhead to attack the other southern nations from.\n\nAs the army set off for their new target, a less than faithful soldier saw a chance to get ahead in the world and road on horse through the high castle mountains around the sea to Dorchmad. He warned the king of the incoming invasion, and in exchange for great privileges and titles he would help them win. The king agreed and had his army assembled and made ready for the incoming attack. The General of the Eleena army on the other hand had been warned that the soldier had gone off into the mountains for no known reason. The general who knew the man from the last campaign when his brother died in the large battled guessed he was probably off to visit a mountain shrine. Or home refused his council's request to seen a rider to slay the deserter, but the general wouldn’t have it.\n\nOn arriving at the site of the new invasion Eleena ships began the process of disembarking their army. A task that would take a whole day. The Thunder Warriors were the only force to fully disembark. Before they were set upon by the enemy. Ships continued to drop off troops for the whole day as the battle raged on. The Thunder Warriors being the anchor keeping the battle going. Slowly even the mighty warriors were pushed back to a rock formation where the enemy’s superior numbers wouldn’t help them. When they were in position though, unseen catapults launched rocks from the woods smashing into the outcropping, and crumbling the stone to the sea. Seeing the mighty Thunder Warriors finally defeated, the general ordered a full retreat and the army pulled out.\n\nThe event that would be known as “The Dropsite Massacre” Is the main reason Eleena hasn’t invaded any nation for almost a decade now. Every couple of years they will drive their citizens into a religious frenzy in preparation for a new invasion, but something always “happens” that causes them to have to call it off.\n\nAccording to legend, 5 Thunder Warriors survived the bombardment, and with a battle cry that could be heard form the ships at sea, charged the enemy's force. One by one they were slain, each taking twenty or more with them. The last one reached the center of the force where the traitor was directing the battle, and cut off the snake's head before being impaled with spears from the four guards that were to protect him.\n\nIt has been 50 years since Kathun left and they have achieved almost nothing. Though a few nobles have recognized they haven’t been performing their duty to Kathun, others are content to attempt more peaceful means of going about their mission. This internal strife keeps either side from growing to dominate and keeping the nation as a whole from doing anything. Careful probing from other nations though ensures that the balance of power never leans too far one way.",

Heavens... the boy’s exhibit of raw emotion was like looking at my own soul crying out. \nIt was rather confusing at first. I had to wonder if I had woken from a bad dream as the muffled sounds of crying registered. I sat up and looked toward the bed. Through the haze of sleep I realized it was the source of the sound.\n\n“Kimaris?” I asked as I approached. When he didn’t respond, I gently placed a hand on his trembling back and asked what’s wrong. Oh the poor boy wailed out his confusion asking, “Why is this happening to me?”\n\nI sat down, trying to sooth him. The thing is, I haven’t a clue what’s happening to any of us. I can feel bumps along my shoulders that are itching more and more. The worst part, I’ve seen pieces of feathers on the tips of my fingers and can only assume I’m becoming a bird! Now add that with Kimaris who keeps getting younger- and Bordel too now that I think about it, and I’m having to wonder if this has something to do with our Primordialness. But, I have yet to see any change in Fernwood and Oda.\n\nIn time I laid down next to Kimaris, searching for a hand to hold. I told him I was scared too, or at least, that I had felt that same kind of fear and uncertainty. Suddenly the boy turned toward me and buried himself into my chest. I worried about someone walking in, but remembering the door was locked and that all I was doing was comforting Kimaris in what was his time of need, I relaxed my arms about him. \n\nWe talked a moment longer, he reminding me about how scared he was. The crying continued and so I hummed to him a lullaby- the very one I use to sing to Araja and Sokrin. I’m not sure who fell asleep first, but when I woke this morning, I quickly slipped out of bed. I can only hope Kimaris will be in better spirits today.\n\n\n✻   ✻   ✻   ✻   ✻",

Played by Kerry\n\n Entering a clearing the elves see a dwarf and half-ork past a river to the south. A goblin to the east and a human with his horse. Screaming something or other the goblin runs in side and the elves hide in trees. Ulfgar proceeds to run over to where those elves went, jumping a river in the process but finding none. Barry, not liking goblins runs to the cave mouth. Rayloke preferring if goblins didn't live in his cave, he jumps the river and joins Barry. At this point the elves decided the dwarf and ork were bad and must die. Precedingly Theven shots Ulfgar injuring him.\nLegolas following suit drops him. Bar runs to the cave mouth waiting for the enemy. Rayloke seing his friend drop to those bloody elves he charges over there and misses with a hand axe. Then goblin + goblin boss come out and attack  Barry. Then elves drop Rayloke and Legolas moves to cut the beard off Ulfgar (by this point I'm tired of my brothers bullshit behavior, he does it a lot in D&amp;D). Barry hits the big guy and scares the shit out off the little goblin. Theven then moves to flank big goblin. Legolas gets a bit off a shock when the beard attacks him for cutting it (he then said i should just slit his throat, didn't do it though). Goblin wails on Barry for a bit. Ulfgar the dies :/ .

        "text": "The Bad, the Mad and the Outright Terrifying: A Super-villain story Part 1\n\nHello again r/gametales! We had a tied vote back in https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/4day47/shadowrun_what_we_are_in_the_shadows_part_9/ for the next story to tell, so I will write up this lovely ditty and then start on Emergence. Strap yourselves in for a not-so-epic tale of confusion and desperation. You always hear about the heroes, those cape wearing paragons of justice and virtue. What about the bad guys? With great power comes absolutely zero responsibility...until you're the only ones left. \n\nLet me provide a little bit of background before we bite into the meat of things. This world is very similar to ours: History has followed the same path along the years and society has developed as a mirror image of our own. The only real exception is the presence of people with extraordinary abilities; enhanced strength, self-propelled flight and a myriad of amazing powers that boggled the mind. For the most part, these marvellous individuals were ordinary people trying to live out their lives in privacy. There were those who sought to make the world a better place with their deeds and they faced those who, of course, tried to use their gifts for selfish or cruel purposes. Above them all, there was Pinnacle. \n\nThis world's Doctor Doom, it's Thanos and Lex Luthor combined, he was the biggest of the bads and seemingly uncaring of anything other than his own schemes. Superheroes knocking at his front door? Not his problem. His 'contemporaries' vowing vengeance on their seemingly unbeatable foes? Stop acting like a petulant child, you lost handily. A race of hyper-intelligent reptilian aliens has arrived on Earth and is offering to share their technology with humanity? Not even a blip of his evil-dar. Such was the way of his world. None of the teams that patrolled the world were brave enough to engage him in combat, especially after he had made an example out of the Midnight Maruader. He had not been seen for some months, and the world was on edge. As it turned out, there were other things to worry about. \n\nIt had been almost a week since the Zel'tan had arrived, their mothership hovering above New York city. Delegates of the United Nations had been in constant contact with the physically superior, technologically advanced lizard-folk and the world was hopeful. They had arrived with promises of peace, shiny baubles to placate us. After the world's leaders announced that everything was alright, the Zel'tan invited Earth's greatest protectors on-board so that they could personally investigate for any dastardly deeds. They even made an event out of it, a feast for superheroes the world around to enjoy; a reward for putting their lives on the line everyday. While there were a few, more noble individuals among the spandex wearing community, many of them had egos almost as swollen as their muscles. Hundreds of costumed crusaders rose up into the colossal Zel'tan vessel that morning, for the feast or to get to the bottom of things. The day continued as per usual for Earth and it's people, in whatever life they had chosen. \n\nThis is where we meet our brave adventurers, these stalwart examples of restraint and compassion. Sadly, this isn't that kind of story. Our cast are murderers and thieves, swindlers and cannibals. Hunted by the law and thwarted at every turn by those wretched buffoons the media call 'heroes'. It was a truly dark time to be a bad guy. If you require an example, look no further than Minato Arisato. A Japanese-American in his early twenties, Minato had always possessed an affinity with the spirit realm. Whether it be communicating with them or influencing them to inhabit the living, the dead bent to his whim. So far, he had used this for petty crime; holding up a few armoured cars, robbing a bank or two. It was made all the more simple because of a gift he had received from his spirits: A hypnotic voice of suggestion that only those with a strong will could resist. It certainly did not hurt that the boy was painfully handsome. Physically attractive, intelligent and powerful; a perfect combination for a super-villain. \n\nSo why was he being marched dejectedly down the hallway of New York City's minimum security super-prison, dressed in the eye-sore that was inmate-orange? The answer walked behind him, a hand pressing firmly on his shoulder: An absolutely gorgeous Native American woman dressed in shimmering blue spandex. River Fox was his arch-enemy, as much as a small-time crook could have one. Five times he had broken out of prison and five times she had caught him without much effort. Their relationship, such as it was, was filled with flirtatious back-and-forth. River Fox knew that Minato, or Kitsune as he preferred to be called, was really quite harmless. Sadly, the law was quite stringent on mind-control.\n\n“Come on, River! Why do you always have to go and spoil my fun?” Minato whined playfully, winking at her over his shoulder. The heroine rolled her eyes with a good natured smile.\n\n“You know the law, Minato. Theft is a crime and it has a punishment.” Her tone was light even if her grip was not. \n\n“It wasn't theft, he wanted to give it to me!” This was Minato's go-to defence, one that had been tried once too often.\n\n“Mind-control makes people want to do all sorts of things.” She chided him with the air of a teacher scolding a small child, though the corner of her lips twisted in good humour. Her prisoner shrugged nonchalantly, a wry smirk across his face.\n\n“Not you though. Couldn't make you do anything even if I wanted to.” The duo stopped before an empty cell, the metal door sliding open with an electronic whirr. Minato slipped inside gracefully, surveying his temporary dwelling with an unimpressed glance before spinning. “Wouldn't anyway. No challenge in that. How about it? Want to give me your number?” His winning smile, Minato's ace in the hole, evoked an amused smirk from the woman.\n\n“Sure. I'll give you a number. Seven-two-three.” Minato frowned in confusion, tilting his head as the cell-door sealed him in. Before he could ask, River Fox gestured to the wall behind him. “It's your cell number. If you're still here when I come by in a few weeks, I'll think about giving you my number.” She blew him a kiss through the steel bars before striding away. Minato chuckled quietly as he watched her go, enjoying the view. \n\n“Have fun at breakfast with the aliens! Tell me how the scones are!” His words echoed down the corridor, eliciting aggravated grumbling from his fellow empowered inmates. Minato flopped down onto the mattress, testing the weight of it before grunting in acceptance. He snagged the remote to his tiny, bolted to the wall, television and began to idly flip through all four channels available. Each of them showed the same thing: Heroes gathering from across the world to attend the proceedings. “Bloody capes.” Minato snarked to himself.\n\nAcross the city, at the bustling dock district, another individual suffered under the oppressive yolk of superhuman vigilantes. Huddled inside a vacant warehouse, Baron Anthony von Rotezhan tried to catch his breath. Wrapped in a thick shroud to protect himself from the burning rays of the sun, Rotezhan cursed his misfortune at ever having heard of the Dark Guardians. \n\n\"Meddlers, ingrates, peasants all! How dare they try to prevent me from acquiring my inheritance! They shall rue the day that they opposed me.\" The pale-faced man seethed quietly in his corner of darkness, long limbs stretched out uncomfortably behind some storage crates. This was but one in a long line of temporary shelters that Baron Rotezhan had been forced to seek after his defeat by Britain's foremost team of supernatural protectors. His plots foiled, his body bearing fresh scars to remind of his failures, the malevolent aristocrat had fled to America under the promise of protection. It had been an arduous journey but the good Baron had managed it with some difficulty. To his despair, it was not sanctuary that awaited him but a desperate escape from more of these so-called heroes. It had been days since then and the situation was looking dire.\n\n“I will bring ruin upon you, yes.” His words were drawling now, saliva leaking from the corner of his mouth. Shadows wrapped around his form, his body turning as insubstantial as the darkness around him. Rotezhan's jaw cracked as it stretched, rows of razor-sharp teeth forcing their way through his gums and his hands turned to claws as long talons forced their way past his fingernails. The Baron stood finally, his bestial frame shifting with barely contained rage. A faint mist filled the air, an indescribable chill that leached the warmth from everything. He could hear them approaching now, heavily armed and prepared for anything: A SWAT team, loaded for bear. How unfortunate for them that he was no bear. \n\nThey were the epitome of professionalism, breaching the factory and moving in to establish a perimeter. Their eyes followed their weapons and each of them kept themselves well appraised of the squad's location. It must have come as a shock to the team leader when he issued orders to his well-trained officers and no-one responded. It was not nearly as shocking as when he turned and came face to face with an unholy combination of slavering lycanthrope and sentient shadow. His weapon fell from lip fingers as his heart beat so hard that it threatened to explode in his chest. The creature emitted a rumbling growl as it placed a bloody hand on his head. \n\n“Barghast does not feel fear! Barghast is fear!” When the reinforcements arrived seconds later, they were greeted with a stomach wrenching display of gore. Many hardened law enforcement agents could not contain themselves from vomiting at the offal and intestines strewn around the warehouse floor. The more resilient of them noticed that several limbs were missing from the haphazard pile and were horrified at the implication. Several warehouses over, Barghast smiled grimly as he enjoyed a well earned snack and a spot of television.\n\nEvent Horizon was neither imprisoned nor hunted. The speedster enjoyed a comfortable, if somewhat low-key, lifestyle thanks to his lack of ambition. He was fast enough to evade the police but not fast enough to draw the attention of any ego-maniacal heroes and he never hit anywhere too big. Armed with his hyper-dense pole and stronger than the average person because of his own increased density, Event Horizon could break into nearly any building with the simple application of repeated blunt force trauma. His few run-ins with the costumed crowd had turned out well enough because none of them hit him hard enough to really do anything.\n\nSadly, his days of luxury were coming to a close: Event Horizon, the only name he really responded too, was broke. The last job had tided him over for several months but expenses were piling up and bills needed paying. It was with a heavy heart that the small-time crook decided that he would have to go job-hunting. There was one thing that he needed to do first, part of his daily ritual that required completion. Locking himself away in his studio, Event Horizon started up his play-list and danced. The amateur ballet star zipped across his stage with the enthusiasm of someone truly dedicated to their art, twisting and turning with reckless abandon. This continued for an hour before he called it quits, sweat staining his body. One quick shower and he was resolved to meet the day head on. There was only one place in New York that powered criminals could get work without too many questions asked and that was Moe's.\n\nMoe's was a small establishment, filled with unsavoury sorts sharing stories of debauchery. Event Horizon felt right at home, swaggering with a confidence derived from being literally bullet-proof. Groups of bikers parted to let him pass and mugs of shitty beer were raised in his honour. Moe, the owner of this charming bar, was a tiny man with large bottle-cap glasses and an even larger shotgun under the bar. The pair of them had a cordial relationship: Event Horizon respected Moe because he could find jobs and Moe respected the fact that Event Horizon could turn him into a smear across the bar. All in all, it actually managed to work. \n\n“Alright Moe?” Event Horizon kept it light, reaching behind the bar for a beer. The little man slapped his hand gently, retrieving the drink himself. Pouting, the speedster accepted the booze and chugged it down. Once he was finished, Event Horizon wiped his face clean and grinned down at the diminutive mercenary. “Got any jobs for me?” Moe sighed in irritation and fidgeted with his glasses for a moment. One hand dipped beneath the counter and returned with a manilla folder full of notes. It was as Moe placed the information on the bar for Event Horizon that one of the bikers swore loudly.\n\n“Holy shit! Moe, turn that shit up!” All eyes turned to him and then to the television he was pointing at. Silence reigned as Moe raised the volume and the news report started to play.\n\n“Ladies and gentlemen, in all of my years covering the news...I have never seen anything like this.” The screen displayed an older woman, the well known Tracy Tresser. Her tone was choked in a way that no-one watching had ever heard before and some splotchy make-up barely concealed her red-rimmed eyes. “At nine o'clock this morning, the world's greatest heroes joined the Zel'tan above New York for a celebration of peace and unity. At eleven o'clock, this footage was transmitted to all media outlets and government facilities.” The screen cut away to show a massive fire-fight roaring through alien architecture as  superheroes and Zel'tan battled each other. The fight continued for a few moments before an explosion roared through the conflict. Once the dust settled, the Zel'tan began to execute each of the fallen heroes with ruthless efficiency. \n\nMoe's bar was silent, the usual crowd hypnotised by the display before them. The same played out in New York City's super-prison as Minato watched on wide-eyed at the slaughter and hoping that River Fox was safe. Even Barghast watched breathlessly as his greatest foes were cut down with disturbing ease. All around the world, humanity watched as their protectors died like whimpering animals at the hands of these saurian soldiers. It was only when Zel'tan ships began to shimmer into existence over capitol cities all over Earth that people began to react.\n\n“Ho...” Event Horizon whispered in awe as beams of energy sliced through the Emprie State Building.\n\n“...Ly.” Kitsune gasped as the prison began to shake from the Zel'tan assault.\n\n“Shit.” Barghast muttered darkly, tossing aside his finger food in disgust.\n\nThe invasion had begun.\n\n",

        "text": "(...or perhaps more accurately, **Three Tales of Why We Can't Have Nice Things**)\n\nWe last left our heroes here, with rumours of a dragon attacking Dorr Outpost to the north of Grandia City, and a freshly posted bounty: [Last Time!](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/4bbk5z/5e_best_heroes_only_bad_news_and_weird_news/)\n\n\nThe Best Heroes!(TM) are:\n\n**Ulaan** - TN Half-Elf Ranger - Stoic former military scout from a faraway land. Officially a travelling ambassador before the weird magics originating from Grandia ripped him from his corner of reality (Unofficially, he and those he serves both just wanted him to be out of his home Empire after he became disillusioned with the way things worked there).\n\n**Dirk** - CN Half-Orc Barbarian - A big bruiser with a heart of MUSCLES and MANLINESS! There have been some hints dropped about his relationship with his tribe prior to his arrival in Grandia. Ulaan and the others haven't really attempted to probe to deeply into that seemingly sore point.\n\n**Decei*p*t** - TN? Tiefling Warlock - She of the inexplicable silent \"p\". Raised in an extremely patriarchal society, she's been passing herself off as a man for many years. Only recently, through circumstance rather than trust, has her feminine nature been shared with the group. Acerbic, misanthropic, (pyro-maniacal?), and entirely unapologetic. Also brought to Grandia against her will by teleportation magic.\n\n**Trevor** - CG Half-Elf Cleric - Grandian native. Rabble-rousing, ~~sewer~~*Storm Drain*-dwelling, emotional, teenaged trickster-cleric. Anti-theistic and unaware of the true source of his powers (though, if the only god your society worshiped was a tyrannical \"God-King\", you might be a little ignorant and hostile towards the concept of religion too). Provider of the heals, steals, and all the feels.\n\n**Forsetti** - LN Human Paladin - Grandian native as well. Noble-born, compulsive social climber and incorrigible flirt. Does have a taste for JUSTICE! and a strong drive to protect others. Recently caught up in a scandal when a noble he was trying to build stronger ties with was arrested for unseemly conduct. Said noble has since most likely joined the ranks of the skeletal guards protecting Grandia. For his part in the incident, Forsetti has been assigned to community service, and thus will be unable to join his comrades for their next adventures **[[Forsetti's player went skiing this weekend, so he wasn't there for yesterday's session]]**\n\nToday's third tale sees a new compatriot join the Best Heroes!:\n\n**Frylock** of the Fourth House - LN? Human Fighter (Eldritch Knight) - Grandian native. Failed out of the academy responsible for the creation and maintenance of the Iron Guard, an elite force in direct service to one of the three top generals of God-King Gabriel[1]. His failure was not enough to warrant death, and survived the training, unlike many of his class. With nowhere else to go, he was sent to serve his nearest biological relative, a distant great uncle of some sort who is a wizard in the city. He now basically does whatever errands and odd-jobs his uncle has for him. Still very much a believer in the system that God-King Gabriel has established, and a dutiful citizen, despite his failures. \n\n**[[For the side-quest that is this dragon-slaying chapter, our DM expressed an interest in letting someone else run the game for a while, so Deceipt's player has taken over the DM's chair temporarily, and our DM has rolled up a character to play. As I understand it, most of this adventure is self-contained, but the two have worked together on making sure everything story-wise still gels properly with everything else.]]**\n\n[1] **[[The one we've nicknamed Bad-Axe. Apparently the Iron Guard appear to be humans that are completely covered in a metallic skin - per what the DM has said \"picture Colossus from X-Men, but with swords and wearing kilts\" The previous tale goes into a bit of this backstory stuff, I can explain more if necessary, but only as much as our DM has revealed to us]]** \n\n*****\n\nTale #1: **Ceci N'est Pas une Chat** (or, **The Treachery of Felines**)\n\nIt had been a pleasant enough morning, if a bit weird. Though, that was basically the norm in Grandia, wasn't it? Trevor had brought a new friend and ally of his from the ~~sewers~~*STORM DRAINS* back to the Green Lady Inn to meet the rest of the group and begin formulating plans for future endeavours. However, Harold the Wise was less subtle in his distrust of the Grandian government than even Trevor. Replete with a hat made of thinly-pressed metal and a musk that only comes from a lifetime of dwelling and bathing in er... runoff, Harold ranted and raved while the rest of the group sat politely in awkward silence (Trevor listened intently, completely enthralled and and enraptured by this truly awe-some sage of the Storm Drains). Nora Greer, proprietor of the Inn, and our gracious landlady eventually came over and told the group that their new guest was making her other patrons profoundly uncomfortable, and asked the group to *kindly* escort him off the premises immediately.\n\n\"Look, I like you guys. You've done a lot for me and my friends, including rescuing Mary, and for that, I'm grateful. But this isn't Anachists-United. All of this talk of sedition could bring the Shadows down on us. If we're lucky. So, take that talk somewhere else. For what it's worth though, if they do come looking for ya, I'll send 'em to room 13 first. That guy's always late on his rent. Oh, speakin' a-which...\\*cough\\*\"\n\nEscorting their new, uh, friend back to his residence, Ulaan noticed something out of the corner of his eye. A cat, but with a fifth leg hanging limply out of its back and dragging along the ground on its left side. A curious sight, perhaps, but not even the cracking the top 10 weirdest things he'd seen all week. It was as they began to walk back towards the inn that Dirk spotted the cat again. It seemed to be keeping its distance from the group, but was noticeably following them. Upon being spotted the cat sat and pretended to clean itself. It was the fact that it was missing its leg by a good several inches with each lick that truly aroused everyone's suspicions.\n\n\"I can speak with animals, given the proper time to prepare my ritual. Let us see if the little beast lingers long enough for that.\"\n\nAs Dirk began the necessary steps, the rest of the group casually spread out around the cat, subtly cutting off many of the major escape routes it might opt to take. Ulaan leaned nonchalantly against the corner of a building, near an alley. Deceipt browsed a vendor's goods, near a corner that connected to another street. Trevor sat at a fountain, drinking and refilling his waterskin. Once the ritual was complete, Dirk calmly approached the cat and began asking it, rather gently, to tell him who and what it was. \"MEOW!\" was the cat's response. **[[Kinda like [This!](https://youtu.be/ndsaoMFz9J4), moreso than an actual meow]]**. It rolled over on it's back, and made a sound that was almost, yet not completely, unlike purring.\n\n\"Look, cut the crap you little beast! I know you can understand me!\" Dirk picked up the cat by its scruff and gave it a solid shake.\n\n\"MEOW!\", the cat protested.\n\n\"Now, listen here you freakish little furball, if you don't start spillin' it right fucking now, I'm going to roast you alive!\" Deceipt's hand began to glow with a fiery aura.\n\n\"...MEOW?\"\n\nDeceipt narrowed her gaze and furrowed her brow. While delivering the most fearsome of death glares, she realized that this had all the hallmarks of some sort of shape-shifting about it, but this was far beyond her realm of knowledge. **[[Arcana check: very passed]]**\n\n\"Let's take this thing to Grimlock.  He's gotta have something in his collection that'll tell us what this thing is.\"\n\nThe group headed to the library where Deceipt had been working on researching teleportation magic, and where she had met, Mr. Grimlock. A wise wizard, well-versed in magical theory and lore.\n\nAs the wizard opened the door to his private chambers, Dirk extended his arm, all but shoving the (surprisingly completely cooperative) cat-thing into Grimlock's face. \"This cat is not a cat. Tell us what it is.\"\n\n\"Ah, Deceipt, and um, the rest of you. Yes, please, *do* come barging into my laboratory demanding favours,\" He opened the door to let them in. \"A cat that's not a cat, you say? Well, let's get it strapped onto the cat table, then.\" He led the group towards a small table near the centre of the lab. The cat was quickly fastened to the apparatus quite securely, with a number of straps. \n\n\"See that you do not inflict grievous harm upon this creature.\"\n\n\"Oh, *of course*, please *do* continue to tell me how to do my job while I'm doing you a favour. Deceipt, you may be able help me with this investigation. The rest of you can find your way upstairs, to the observation room.\" Grimlock pointed at a windowed balcony overlooking his lab.\n\n\"I will remain here.\"\n\n\"*As if*. If Dirk's stayin', no way I'm missin' out on anything!\" Trevor flipped his hair out of his eyes.\n\nUlaan simply shrugged his shoulders and leaned up against the nearest wall.\n\n\"er.... right. Deceipt, grab me that smaller scalpel. We'll move slowly here, seeing as your surly *friend* insists on limiting the investigative process...\"\n \nGrimlock and Deceipt set about prodding and probing the cat-thing, under Dirk's watchful eye. Trevor meanwhile, started fidgeting, eventually throwing up his arms and loudly declaring \"Whatever, BO-RING!\", and began wandering around the lab. With everyone else so distracted by the cat, he decided to see if there might be anything worth acquiring for himself. He came across a large cabinet, full of various potions. Blue, red, green. All looked pretty much just like coloured water in boring flasks. \n\nBut, oh, there - on the top shelf. Jackpot. A large flask with a long neck. The liquid inside was a mysterious shimmering green. A symbol was embossed onto a small metal plate, bonded to the surface of the flask. Trevor didn't recognize it, but whatever, this had to be worth something! He stood on the bottom shelf. Still too short. He climbed a little higher, placing his feet on the second and third shelves. There was a bit of a clatter as he nudged flasks to the side. He nervously looked around to see if anyone noticed. Ulaan, from his place on the wall began to move \"Shit! Busted by ol' Crankypants!\" Trevor's mind raced. But, no, wait... Ulaan was just stretching. Ulaan's eyes were closed as he rolled his head from side-to-side. He didn't open them again until his head was pointed back at the table and his arms were once again folded across his chest. \"Whew...\" Trevor quickly grabbed the shiny green potion, shoved it in his bag and then hopped back down. The sturdy cabinet hadn't even wobbled under his added weight. **[[Our DM's mechanic for when the party doesn't agree with what one of the members is attempting to do is to do an initiative roll-off. If someone else from the party wins the roll-off, the unwise action is prevented. Otherwise, it goes ahead. I tried to stop Trevor from stealing from our ally, but rolled very poorly, so Ulaan, who was the only person who might have noticed the theft, did not intervene]]**\n\n\"Well, now, this is certainly odd.\" Grimlock noted that the fur sample he had cut from the cat was bleeding a silvery ooze.\n\nDirk growled. \"I said not to hurt-\",\n\n\"No, look. It's from the fur only, I didn't cut into the thing at all!\"\n\n\"Silver blood. Just like the things that the cultists were spawning. Just like the sample we brought you, and you got all excited about... Grimlock, did you make this thing!?\" Ulaan rose from his spot on the wall.\n\n\"No, no. I'd be *proud* if I made this! My cats don't-- Nevermind. Forget I said anything.\"\n\nWheels began to turn in Deceipt's head as this discussion was going on to the side of her. She stared at the cat-thing intently. A thought came to her. It wasn't always the case, but, generally, if something was shape-changed, dealing enough damage to it would cause it to revert back to it's original form. **[[Arcana check: passed, but not high enough to know for sure that this would be the case here]]** In one swift motion, Deceipt brought her hand up and levelled an Eldritch Blast at the cat **[[The cat is restrained. The hit is automatic. Damage roll: natural max damage (10 + mods)]]**.\n\nThe cat exploded. Quite violently. The table was pockmarked with a rather deep crater, and the straps were torn and tattered. \n\nUlaan buried his face in his palm. Dirk cuffed Deceipt on the back of the head.\n\n\"What part of 'Do not harm this creature' did you not understand?\"\n\n\"Nevermind that! Look what you've done to my cat table! Do you not understand how hard it is to acquire this equipment? I got so many strange looks when I went down and commissioned this from Steam Town! And when they delivered and installed it! Just look at this mess!\"\n\nDeceipt explained her actions, and defended it as the right thing to do. \"I used my weakest spell against it!\"\n\n\"You do realize you have hands? You could have just punched it. Look, this scalpel could have made some cuts into it!\"\n\n**[[If you've been with us for a while, you might recall [\"Your witness, detective.\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/489ala/5e_truly_the_best_most_skilled_and_most_noble/). It's at this point that Dirk's player, Deceipt's player's wife, begins scribbling something on her notepad. She hands Deceipt's player the following [contract to sign](http://imgur.com/OR8L4uY). He added the \"purposefully, before signing as Laryssa, Deceipt's birth name.**\n\n**Realizing that, no, there was still too much wiggle room there, she drew up [this second one](http://imgur.com/GbyzoEL).**\n\n**It was enshrined on our [wall of allies](http://imgur.com/nRJCE3j), just to the left of Vic, Leon, and Pip. (Doc Brown is Mr. Dippel. A wizard in service of the City Guard, and close friend of Captain Vic. He's the one that helped forge our new identities. The other guy is Grimlock).]]** \n\n\"Whoa, guys, guys, chill out here! Look, I can fix this table up for you. No harm, no foul.\" Trevor cast mending and began repairing the table. As he gets in close, he sees the last traces of the cat-thing boiling away and hears one last confused \"...Meow?\"\n\n\"...Look, it's always a pleasure having you over to explode my things. *My very expensive things.* But, now I think it's time for you all to leave.\"\n\nTrevor complies with this as soon as he's finished mending the table. The others linger a bit and try to smooth things over with Grimlock.\n\nTrevor scurries back across town, to his room at the inn. Once he closes the door, he eagerly fishes his prize from his bag. He begins examining it carefully. \"Hmm.. well, guess I should taste a little bit and see what it does.\" He uncorks the flask near his mouth, and goes to poor a drop onto his tongue.\n\nThe fluid inside, upon contacting the air, coalesces into a viscous silver liquid, which slowly begins to ooze out from the glass, when suddenly, as one whole unit, it squirms and launches itself onto the floor. \"What the...?\" Trevor tries to grab the ooze, but it dodges him and slithers off to the corner of the room, then slides down the space between the floorboards.\n\nTrevor lays there with stunned look on his face. One that flashes briefly on confusion, before arriving at regret and nervousness. The flask is summarily thrown into the trash at the end of the alley, and his teammates notice him acting shiftier for the next couple of days.\n\n*****\n\nTale #2: **Fancy Dinners With Friends in High Places**\n\nThe next few days had been largely uneventful. Most days not spend working as bouncers/security at the inn we used to restock supplies for the coming dragon-hunting bounty.\n\nSitting at the dinner table, Ulaan is generally quiet as he eats his stew. Listening to the others prattle on about this and that. Trevor babbling about overthrowing the God-King, Dirk challenging Deceipt to an arm-wrestling match after she said something thoughtless. The usual. He's feeling a bit, off though. Something's not sitting quite right in the pit of his stomach. Out of the corner of his eye, he spots something strange. The knot in the wood of the table. It's... an eye? It's watching him.\n\nThat can't be right. Now, Ulaan prides himself on his dignity, and not panicking at every little oddity here and there. So, what's a proud, calm, collected, battle-hardened soldier to do when confronted with such weirdness? He subtly slides his stew bowl over the knot-eye. That's what.\n\nAll is well for a few moments. Until the table starts to pulsate. Slowly at first, then increasingly violently. Subtly nudging the bowl, Ulaan sees that the eye is indeed still there. Hrmm.\n\n\"....stexcusemyself..notfeel...quiteso...l\" Ulaan mumbles as he tries to stand. His feet immediately fail him, and he falls face-first into the table. Which now has grown teeth and is attempting to eat him. He begins shouting incomprehensibly and flailing his fists around.\n\n\"Whoa, whoa, Crankypants, let's bring it down a notch.\" Trevor begins casting Calm Emotions, but as he's making the proper gestures with his fingers and about to place his hand on Ulaan's shoulder, long jagged teeth begin to protrude from Ulaan's back. Jerking his hand back quickly, with a \"What the...-\" Trevor notices the sofa in the corner shoot a dart at his neck. \"Uncooooooool...\"\n\nAs this is happening, Dirk stands up quickly from the table and begins running for the door. However, he forgets that the proper order of operations is \"Open door, then walk through\", so he crashes into the solid piece of oak. He feels a sensation of himself splintering apart from the force, as he crashes to the ground, smacking his head and blacking out.\n\nDeceipt? Well, she just decides that right here, right now is the perfect time for a nap and gently leans back in her chair.\n\nAll four, as the last sliver of light crosses their eyes, notice a dark film of some sort seep out from the cushions of the sofa...\n\n**[[An unknown amount of time passes]]**\n\n\"Awake. Hrmm. Weird coppery taste in mouth. Hrmm... Restrained. No. Not, actually. Just sort of held in place by a single strap. Just keeping me upright. Steel. This chair is steel. This table is steel.\n\nThis whole room is made of steel?\n\nThere is a very rich meal in front of me. My friends! ...Sitting at this same table, also just waking up. Forsetti was there as well, looking pretty scruffy from his time in the prison.\n\nWho is that at the end? Who are these people? Four of them along each wall...\n\nPoisoned. Definitely ingested poison.\" Ulaan's mind darted along many trains of thought as he slowly regained consciousness. **[[Survival Check to understand what happened: Passed]]**\n\nAs the group began to wake up, the man at the head of the table turned his head to address them. It was only then that Ulaan realized that this person had not been moving at all prior to this. He... it? Had sat rigidly, perfectly upright and still - not even making the subtle movements of breathing or fidgeting. Despite the ample lighting provided for the room by the candles on the table and lights hanging from the ceiling, Ulaan could not see this man's face beneath his large, horned helmet. In fact, the man's plate mail obscured just about every part of him. Was that a massive axe holstered along his back? **[[Consulting the [wall of enemies](http://imgur.com/v3yL3RS): Uh-oh.]]**\n\n\"Ah, gentlemen. And lady. You're awake. I was wondering when you might return to us. Allow me to introduce myself. I'm certain that there are many names that you've heard for me, but please, call me Indrid Cold.\"\n\n\"heh... Ingrid is a girl's name...\" Ulaan was unsure of how or why that slipped out.\n\n\"Ah, yes. The dosage can be tricky with this sedative. The effects should wear off at some point. No matter. I merely wanted an opportunity to meet with you all, face-to-face. You see, I've been keeping an eye on you ever since [recent events](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/4bbk5z/5e_best_heroes_only_bad_news_and_weird_news/), and...--\"\n\n\"Yeah, we've actually been out there solving problems instead of oppressing the people, you tyrant!\" It was actually hard to tell if Trevor's lack of judgement was at all a side effect of the poisoning.\n\n\"Indeed you have! God-King Gabriel is quite aware of what you've been up to, and has taken an interest in your talents.\" Cold stretched his gauntlet-clad hand across the table and clasped it down on Trevor's shoulder. It was cold. Too cold. Painfully cold. No matter.\n\n\"We use our talents for good! To help people, you--\"\n\n\"Yes, though, as the records state, during your previous escapades, you caused the death of a horse, destruction of a cart, and the horrible burning of the man that you *appropriated* that vehicle from - all in service of the greater good! Much like our good God-King Gabriel has done with many of his actions.\" Trevor felt the grasp tighten around his shoulder during this little speech, but then hold released and Cold held his hand up, making a beckoning motion to one of the attendants along the wall behind him. \"Matthew, if you would, please.\" The man stepped forward and presented a pouch.\n\n\"About that horse and cart. We feel that your actions were more than justified, given the extreme circumstances that you faced. And we're quite certain that there was no malicious intent with any of your ...*unfortunate* outcomes. You also took responsibility and made sure that proper amends were made to the wronged parties. This shows good strength of character. As such, the good and generous God-King Gabriel wishes to compensate you. After all, your actions were performed on behalf of his City Guard, which you are acting deputies of.\" Matthew placed the pouch of gold into the bag around Deceipt's shoulder. \"Our kingdom always has need for heroes of great talent. Those who serve the state well will be rewarded as is appropriate. Our kingdom has little tolerance for villains of great infamy. Those who cause problems will be... *rewarded as is appropriate*.\" He said that last bit glaring directly at Trevor.\n\nTrevor looked like he was about to mouth off again, but, as Cold turned his gaze towards the teenager, he thought better of it.\n\n\"Now, I do apologize for interrupting your earlier meal. You understand that our schedule is quite restrictive when it comes to meeting with our valued subjects. As compensation, please, enjoy this meal before you. It was prepared by some of the finest chefs in the employ of the kingdom, as I understand it.\"\n\nDirk takes him up on that offer. It is the most delicious meal he has ever eaten. It brings a tear to his eye. The others remain suspicious, considering how they were previously incapacitated. Forsetti, who has been sitting there, bewildered the whole time, eventually decides that he is entirely too hungry to refuse this.\n\n\"Suit yourselves. There is one last piece of business that I must address before our short time together runs out. --Matthew.\"\n\nMatthew again stepped forward, this time, he opened up a different pouch. An eye, about the size of a fist, floated out of the bag.\n\n\"You may notice this around for the next, oh... well, let's not worry about the length of time, shall we?

        "text": "So last year I ran a Black Crusade campaign for the first time. Me and my friends were all familiar with the 40k Universe and the system as a whole. So this is our party (and sadly I don't remember the character's names)\n\nA Chaos Space Marine (Or CSM for short) who was eccentric even beyond chaos's standards (Chaos for the purpose of grins and giggles.). He totes around a twin linked autocanon that he's pretty good with. \n\nA heretek who has stated multiple times that he's going to kill everyone one of these days. No one ever takes him seriously yet he takes the initiative of building up a small army of guardsman.\n\nAnd finally our Psyker of Tzeentch who embodies the randomness of the God of Change. One moment he’s kind and cordial and the next he’s killing one of his mutant servants because the mutant is to dumb to understand Low Gothic.\n\nSo now that our party is introduced let us get onto the tale of a TPK by butterscotch pudding.\n\nSo I hadn’t had a session prepared and decided to run one the pregenrated adventure in the back of the Tome of Change supplement (which fit into my plans because they were going to go and visit the planet the adventure took place in anyways.)\n\nSo session one the party arrives on the planet (minus the hereteks player because he was out of town for the weekend) and into one of the major cities. They notice that it’s oddly empty and as they’re wandering about they are approached by three different goons of three rival sorcerers. The goons tell the party to meet up with their master because their master wants to set up an alliance with them. So they go about, talk with the three different sorcerers for most of the session. The party decides that they’ll discuss their options with the heretek once he returns and plan to return to the ship. At this point the CSM player asks me a question.\n\nCSM:  “Can I get three three-gallon drums of butterscotch pudding?”\n\nMe: “Suureee? Roll me an acquisition test.”\n\nI do the appropriate modifiers for the pudding drums and, by the dark gods, he gets the pudding drums. And he looks at me with this cheeky grin upon his face and states that he’s going to go to the heretek’s quarters and put a thin layer of butterscotch pudding on every surface and shove it in every nook and cranny. I’m sitting with this rather dumbfounded look upon my face and allow him to. \n\nSession two rolls by. We have the heretek player with us and he discovers that his quarters have been defiled with butter scotch. He figures out that it’s the chaos space marine and starts to put into his motion of ‘Kill the marine first’. They go back down to the planet and meet with one of the sorcerers and ally with him, receiving nifty daemon weapons. The heretek suggests that they hijack one of the daemon engines, this giant floating manta-ray like daemon enginge. They manage to nab it and run, betraying the sorcerer they allied with. He sends a helldrake after them to deal with them and the party barely survives the encounter with it. All of them are battered and bruised and the marine’s armor is damaged. \n\nAt this point the heretek goes “I’ll repair your armor” and he does so. He also adds several pounds of explosive charges into the space marines shoulder pauldrons. After they’ve healed up they go back down to the planet and deal with the sorcerer. The marine is  knocked unconscious from psychic shenanigans and the heretek and Psyker manage to take down the sorcerer. As such they retreat back to their ship to rest and figure out their plan of attack.\n\nSession three, or as what I like to call “When the butter scotch killed everyone”, rolls in. The CSM is denying that he was knocked unconscious by the sorcerer and the heretek goes “I have footage of you. Remember I’m part machine” and pulls out a data slate with the marine being knocked unconscious. At this point the CSM pulls out his autocannon and takes a shot at the data slate. He proceeds to miss it and I look at him with d100 in hand and ask him high or low to see if he accidentally shot the heretek. Thankfully he says low and the shot misses the heretek by a hair. \n\nThe heretek’s player snaps his attention to make and goes \nHeretek: “I’m doing it.”\nMe: “Are you sure?”\nHeretek: “Yes!”\n\nSo I pick up a load of d10’s and roll as the explosives go off in the marine’s armor. I ignore the armor and, again by the dark god’s own twisted favor, the CSM is still standing with only a few wounds left. The heretek dodges out of the explosion and the poor Psyker is knocked unconscious. The CSM is not happy and draws out a power sword. He swings and manages to do enough damage that he takes off the heretek’s lower jaw. The heretek turns and runs into the hanger with his guardsmen.\n\nI manage to get everyone to calm down and agree to work with each so that they don’t all murder each other. The psyker’s back awake and healed up a bit from the ship’s doctor. So the party gathers in the hanger bay and are chatting when the heretek offers the others to join him in looking down upon the planet. As soon as the CSM steps next to him both of them immediately grapple each other, trying to throw each other out of the glass window and out into space. \n\nThe Psyker, fed up with their behavior, attempts to telekinetically shove them out of the window and fails to do so. He decides at this point he’s going to move away from the fighting so he can save his own hide. The heretek orders the daemon engine to ram CSM, not realizing that doing so would yank him out into space. The daemon does so gleefully and rams they both out of the window and into the void of space. \n\nThey’re both floating and still fighting each other. The CSM wins the grapple and tosses the heretek towards the planet. He fires his gun back at the ship and hit the hole where the deamon was blocking. He manages to convince it to move back and the Psyker, failing his agility test, flies out of the hole and hits the marine. All three of them re-enter the atmosphere, dying from the impact.\n\nI’m sitting there slack jawed and slightly broken. All three of them are sitting there before they lose it, realizing they managed to pull a 1.5 on the scale of Henderson on me. They all ask me if I’m all right and I just numbly nod my head.\n\nSo that’s how a TPK happened because of butterscotch pudding. Now any time the CSM’s player brings up butterstoch pudding in any campaign I’ve threatened to inflict harm upon his characters.\n",

        "author": "ArticulateT",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/4e5c4b/shadowrun_special_agent_face/",
        "text": "Ok, so [last time](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/4d68xv/shadowrun_fast_food_massacre/) our runners had completed their first task as professional criminals by rescuing a hostage from a small-time mafia family who ran future-McDonalds.\n\nSince the cyberdeck they found took a month to fence, the group spend some time maxin' and relaxin' until they get a call from their fixer for another job. In the mean time, the players, now in a potentially proper campaign, apply some mild-strength retcon tonic to their characters.\n\n**Sam**, the Elf Street Sammy, is no longer corp owned (as the Corp Born SIN drawback was fairly hard for both GM and Player to handle) and was now albino and an amnesiac. There were a few adjustments to their cyberware, so they were .3 more human than they were the last time.\n\n**Arturia**, the Human Face, hadn't really changed much since the last time, other than having a code name. They still hold all the dice for social interactions, and refuses to share on them.\n\n**Whisper**, the Human PhysAd, is now blind, but has a series of abilities and gear that effectively makes them Daredevil of the year 2072. Came into their adept powers at the age of twelve and was thoroughly enthralled with the Shadowrunning lifestyle throughout their youth, even after losing their eyesight.\n\nThe fixer was one of Arturia's contacts, and he was an Orc called Donahue.\n\nDonahue, also known by his near-coincidental surname of Fixerville, wasn't like most fixers. While most would run a bar, restaurant or skype their clients from their cheeto and porn filled basements, Donahue was a realtor. He ran a 'legitimate business' by selling homes in a suburban area of Seattle. Some of the homes on his list (detached four bedroom homes in an 'ok' neighbourhood) he would have listed for extortionate prices, with their apparent quality indicating they were definitely weren't worth it to those who could afford them, and Donahue wouldn't budge on the price.\n\nThese homes were radio-shielded, lead-lined and constantly EMP'd, with a local talismonger going through them on occasion to ward them against magical eavesdropping. It was these homes that Donahue would permit his clientèle to meet in, discuss and get their jobs from.\n\nThe group met with Donahue at a nice house on 5th Street, and wandered inside while he continued to provide the smug-as-shit realtor sales-pitch. Even when he closed and locked the door behind him, the persona didn't stop, possibly indicating that this was just the normal Donahue.\n\nAs the group got comfortable, he explained that the job against the Fratellis had generated some level of unease among the mafia families of Seattle, especially since the group had implicated the Ciarnellis in the previous job. This meant there was a greater demand of runners to perform subterfuge and wetwork as the other families got a little unnerved by the apparent Ciarnelli power-push.\n\nWhen Sam asked how their fixer knew it was them, since they paid good money for a hacker to scramble and erase information that they were there, Arturia admitted that he had bragged about it when the job was over.\n\nDonahue then got down to brass tax and explained to the group that he had a Johnson waiting for them at a downtown restaurant known as 'Martinis', and that the restaurant was kind of fancy, so they would likely need to go shopping for some nice clothes prior to the meet, especially since the Johnson was kind enough to pay for the meal.\n\nThis lead to a brief shopping montage, as it was more or less explained to the group that a good show of etiquette when getting dressed for a meet was to wear something that emphasised your group role. Arturia wore something formal and graceful, to indicate his role as the group face, Sam wore something formal, though also practical and adjusted to permit ease of movement, and Whisper wore something of a cross between a suit and formal robes of a martial artist, to help emphasise their adept abilities.\n\nMartinis itself was a two-function affair; the ground floor was a nightclub, with a long line of late-teens and young adults waiting for their turn to get drunk and dance, while the first floor was a fancy-pants restaurant with a somewhat smaller, more refined line outside.\n\nLeaving their weapons in security boxes by the door and being padded down by security, the group head inside and are guided by a waiter to the table (they were offered menus, and sadly didn't have any in Braille, but did have an audio version of the menu, or could fetch one of the interns to read the menu to Whisper. Whisper just opted to have one of his teammates do that.)\n\nMr. Johnson, a Minotaur of prim and proper demeanour, was already at the table and delicately sipping on a nice red wine As the group sat down, ordered their meals and favoured wines, the Johnson got right down to business before the food could arrive.\n\nDue to the Ciarnelli power push, his employer would like to get some information on some of their more illicit business transactions, and had reason to believe that an automechanic on the edge of the Redmond Barrens was serving as a covert distribution point for BTL chips. Now, this wasn't inherently terrible, though the chips they specialised in were the kind of things that weren't so innocent. (Instead of skydiving, for example, it would be things like torturing or being tortured, that sort of thing).\n\nHe wanted the group to go in and find all the information they can within their nexus, as well as find a journal. When asked what the journal might look like, Johnson explained it wasn't like a standard tablet or dataslate, but an actual leather bound journal. It was curious, but it was reasonable to assume that, in a world so digital, going backwards might be one of the better security options.\n\nThe group was offered 20k Nuyen for the job, which was negotiated up to 25k due to Face powers, with a 5k bonus if they perform the job without them thinking that anything is immediately wrong.\n\nTask accepted, Johnson and Arturia shook hands and the deal was made just as the main course was brought to the table. The group enjoyed a delicious, though not entirely filling meal, with Johnson footing the bill as promised before he excused himself and lumbered off.\n\nThe task before them, the runners proceeded on their jobs. Arturia got in contact with Donahue to see if he knew where to find a book they can replace the journal with, and was pointed in the direction of Fracas, a talismonger in midtown who might have something of that nature. Then, they contacted another one of the Fixer's contacts, a hacker (who was decidedly made [Sandra Bullock's character from The Net](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Net_(1995_film))) who would might be able to hack the building. Upon being unable to do so, either by an enemy hacker or a damn good firewall, the group picked up a wireless matrix dongle that they could use, as well as being on the look out for a decker in the building.\n\nWith their gear acquired, they went over to the site, only to find it seemingly in the middle of a Lone Star raid, at least from the outside. Squad cars and beat cops form a perimeter around the building. Using their senses, Whisper detects one of the cops to be a mage, with a total of eight people being immediately visible to his ultrasound.\n\nArturia heads over to the barricade and talks with one of the beat cops, rolling god-like con rolls to convince the guy to let him and his partner, Sam, into the building. While this occurs, Whisper manoeuvres to the back of the building, using their gecko-grips and adept skills to scale the wall to an exterior window.\n\nSam and Arturia are introduced to the Lieutenant on duty as Special Agents Black and White, and they request a private conversion with the lieutenant, as well as the clerk behind the counter. They're brought into the garage area, where they find a Dodge Rhino (A big, fuck off APC) that had been stripped of its wheels, windows and almost all of the interior (seats, gadgets, everything) and the doors had been welded shut.\n\nAs the two convince the clerk that they can get rid of Lone Star, and are aware of the BTL dealing, they stay behind in the garage to inspect the Rhino. Sam disables the cameras before they snoop around and find a pair of datasticks (one labelled Blueprint, the other labelled Transcript) on a workbench. As they prepare to leave, Arturia spies a grate in the wall shift open, and a pair of Ferret drones roll out, tasers raised.\n\nOf course, these are Ferret model drones, the kind you'd get for personal security and punishing mild belligerents rather than fighting two highly trained runners, and in a matter of two rounds, the drones are disabled. Looking through the camera of one, more face powers are applied to intimidate the shit out of the decker on the first floor.\n\nthe 'Special Agents' head upstairs, finding the elf decker in the common room, backed against a wall and shakily aiming a pistol at the two, but with Sam helping with the intimidation, the elf drops his weapon and heads downstairs to sit with the Lone Star cops. With the way clear, a window is opened to let Whisper in, and the three make their way to the office where the building's owner is going over some paper work, but not before attaching the wireless Matrix dongle to anearby data port and letting Sandra get to work.\n\nGiovanni Ciarnelli is a portly man, a light shade of red on his face as frustration mounts over the sheer volume of paperwork covering the place. Special Agents Black, White and now Brown, introduce themselves and explain to the man the same schtick from before; that they know about the BTL business and will be able to get rid of lonestar. Sadly, intimidation doesn't immediately work since the fellow is highly aware of how much pull the Ciarnelli family seems to have, but it does provide enough distraction for Whisper to palm the journal, found on a nearby shelf, and replacing it with the blank one.\n\nAfter a brief moment of negotiation from the 'Agents', the three leave, telling Lone Star that they have all they need and that they can go home (Face rolls high, Lieutenant crit-glitches). Hopefully, their little run would make the Lone Star goons the prime suspects if and when the Ciarnellis notice their paydata is gone.\n\nThe group drop off the data at a bar called Murray's in downtown, their contact being an old dwarf named Joseph. The transaction is quick and easy, and the trio suddenly become 30k richer. All in all, a good run.",

        "text": "I know this might be a bit out of the ordinary around here, but I thought some of you might enjoy the story of my most recent Ark: Survival of the Fittest match.  Here we go:\n\nI join a 4v4 lobby as a solo.  Risky manuever, since there's no guarantee that anyone will take you in as part of their team. \n\nNo such trouble for this match. I fall into a group of lewd dudes - no, really- our tribe was the called Lewd Dudes. Those three were friends already, and had their own third party communication channel.  I did not have that service, so I'd be talking to them through in-game means.\n\nNo problem.  I've done this before with groups. I can do it again.\n\nThe game starts.  We play aggressive, heading towards the middle platform where the game begins and ends. There's loot to be had and people to kill.   In the middle, you can find spears, slingshots, and leather armor, all of which are very useful in a melee.\n\nI grab none of that, and instead find myself with 12 cooked meat and some narcotics.  \n\nNo problem. I join in with my tribemates, and I'm ready to punch some people. Luckily, they have weapons of there own, and we get the First Bood of the match.  \n\nWe jump off the platform. It's time we get prepared for the remaining 90 minutes of the game.  Time to get some basic tools going and primitive weap-\n\n3 enemies run up the hill to our position. We have numbers, but I still have no weapon.\n\nI run back to the back of the group and  make three spears. By the time I get back.  2 of my teammates are already dead &amp; gone, but my remaining teammate and I have a 2v1 on our opponent.  With my help, we finish off the last man on their team, and we live to fight on.  \n\nStill almost literally in the shadow of the center platform, my tribemate makes a campfire and we put the max amount of meat on there to cook.\n  \nWith about 25 people left total and only 2 of us left, we need to even the odds.   It's time to hunt.  We start to race down towards the river, looking for some people to kill, running and jumping our way through the forest and-\n\nThe acid rain hits.\n\nNo Problem.   The opponents are going to be in the same acid rain, and maybe we can catch them off - \n\nowowowowow.jpeg.\n\nThe acid rain chews through my armor and my health, and I'm forced to find refuge under a rock. My teammate is nowhere to been seen.\n\nMeanwhile, the acid rain is doing some serious damage out there.   Names start popping up in the sky left and right to signify deaths as the acid rain continues for what seemed like ten minutes. Just as the rain is about to clear up, I see the one message I didn't want to see.  My teammate has died.  It's all up to me against 9 enemy tribes left, with 17 members between them.\n\nI go back the way I came. The campfire with the meat will be cooked by now and that'll give me food and healing for a good portion of the match.\nAs I head up, another event hits the map.  Superloot Crate.  A giant crate at the center platform, filled with all sorts of guns, ammo, and useful crafting materials.\n\n*Interesting.*\n\nI'm all alone, with nothing to lose, and I was heading that way for the meat on the campfire, but if I'm going to do this, I'm going to need a way out of there.   That's where the parachutes come in.\n\nBoom. With half a dozen or so arrows, I kill a Trike, and harvest it for some hide. I craft the parachutes, and without any hesitation I run to the ramp and onto the platform and luckily, miraculously, no one is there.  I check the crate.\n\nJackpot.   \n\nRiot Shield. Shotgun with 17 ammo, Compound bow with metal arrows. Metal Pike  Higher quality Chitin armor. Soups and cooking brews that let me see at night, endure hot or cold weather, run longer, run faster, hit harder, heal faster.\n At this point, I don't even care about the 45 refined metal ingots, and I quickly drop that along with anything else that was weighing me down.\n\nI just gave myself a chance here, but it's not enough.   I parachute glide my way off the platform and across the river to the volcano, feeling like James Bond.\n\nNow it's time to set up base. 55 minutes left, so  I need a place to store stuff and cook more food.  I lay down a few foundations in the cold mountains and set up shop. \n I need to complete my chitin armor set, make a simple pistol if I can since I've got the ammo, and tame some sort of creature to help me in my battle.   I start making blood packs, temporarily draining my heath for when I need it later.\n\nI use tranq arrows to knock an Argentavis out, a giant flying bird that I can ride on it's back and carry people in its talons if I can get close enough.  \n\nMy camp is next to another loot drop, smaller than the first, but from it, I get more soups and stews and some more metal arrows.\n\nThe Argent is tamed, but now there's a Harvest famine.    So much for mining metal.   Shit.   Okay, time to test out my new bird, fly around on it see how she does and - stamina is gone.  Bugs are attacking it.\n\n NotgoodNotgoodNotgood.gif\n\n I attack at the bugs, but as I kill the last of them, I accidentally hit my bird, and it dies.\n\nNow I'm lost with no bird, and what's that stomping sound behind me? A Carnotoraus.  Great.  \"Carno, I don't have time for this. I need to get back to base.\" I tranq it and as It passes out.\n\n I run around until I see a loot beacon.  A new one has spawned where I got the last loot crate. More materials. More metal arrows. More stews, but the important thing is that it means I'm back at base.\n\nThank fucking god.\n\nWhen I get back to base, another Argent is there.  I still have plenty of tranqs, and the new loot crate has prime meat to tame it fast, so down it goes.\n\nI finally have enough metal to craft a smithy (the refined metal I dropped would've been great here, but what can you do?), and I craft another pike.  I have meat that I grab from the fire. I have 6 total blood packs. All I need to do is repair my pike and see if I can get another gun.  My second Argent tames up and I'm feeling good.  People have been dying off slowly and there are only 4 tribes left, including me.\n\nBefore I can do anything more, the Ring of Death is closing in already. \n\nAs calmly as I can, I grab the metal and material from the smithy, and I get on my bird just as the edge of the ring hits.  I'm okay if I'm outside of the boundary for a few seconds, but if I'm there for 30 seconds, it's game over.    \n\nI'm not taking any chances.\n\nI cross the river, set up a new smithy, and use it to repair my gear.  I take stock of my inventory and put things in my hotbar.\n\n - 2 pikes\n\n - 1 shotgun w/ 17 ammo\n\n - 1 compund bow with 38 metal arrows + regular arrows and tranqs\n\n -  50 cooked meat\n\n - 6 blood packs\n\n - water\n\nGood enough.  \nI'm still not taking any chances though.   another tribe is eliminated, and with two other tribes with two tribemates each, I'd rather they fight each other first.     \n\nIt works.\n\nBy the time the ring of death has forced me to the edge of the center platform, it's only me and the last tribe of two.\n\nHoping against hope that I won't have my work cut of for me, I fly up and over the edge and take stock of the situation.\n\n- 1 bronto.\n\n- 2 stegos.\n\n- 1 trike.\n\n - 1 ankylosaur\n\nOh, and they're right in the middle where the superloot crate is dropping again. \n\nWell, shit.\n\nStroke of luck.   Mega fog hits.   If they can't see me, they can't hit me, which means it's a perfect time to attack.   I drink every stew I have, and go in for the strike.\n\nI have to get lucky and hope I can grab one of the players in the mess of dinos. If I can pick them up and drop them off the edge, they'll probably die.\n\nNo luck.  Wait, HORRIBLE luck.  They've got guns.   They're shooting at my bird that I'm riding.  We need to get out of here.\n\n gogogogo.xml\n\nIt's too late.  Between the dinos and the guns, my argent dies, and now I'm on foot  I run to the other side of the circle, and there's no way I'm getting in that mess. I need to thin out the herd.\n\nCompound Bow + metal arrows does an insane amount of damage, so I use those and start sinking them in the bronto.  Their strategy of crowding the place with dinos backfires as the Bronto is stuck and can't maneuver to me.  1 arrow, 2 arrows, 4, 8, 10.   The bronto goes down.  4 dinos and two players left.\n\nI circle around the center.   Shotgun time.   Boom. 1 stego goes down.   No signs of the players.   Trike goes down. There's a player.  They charge at me with the anklyo.   I take out the ankylo and the player with more shotgun shots.\n\n4 shots left.   1 stego, one player riding that stego.\n\nBoom. Take the stego out. hit the player one, missed some shots and *click* out of ammo.\n\nHe's not out of ammo.\n\nMy health regen + running speed stew is still in effect, so I run. I still have plenty of blood packs, so I accidentally eat some cooked meat and then use my blood pack.\n\nI go back in and start shooting him with my bow.  miss. Fuck. Miss. Fuck. Hit. Yay!. Miss. FUCK.\n\nI run and evade until I can use a blood pack again. Accidentally eat more food, then use the blood pack like I meant to.\n\nOh yeah! Still got a riot shield. I use that to block his melee attacks as he has run out of bullets.\n\nI use one more blood pack and more confident than ever, I run in and start smacking him with my pike.  One hit, two hit. 3 hit. \n\nOh god he's hitting back.  I'm panicking.\n\nAccidentally open up my inventory, eat food. finally use blood pack. go in for the kill. 1 hit. 2 hit. 3 hit and he falls, dead.\n\nAs a column of light beams me up in celebration, in real life, I'm pumping my fist and cheering, heart racing in excitement.  I did it.  I won. I fucking clutched it and won.\n\n\nAfter the match, I get a friend request on steam. It's one of my teammates from the match. Turns out the group stayed tuned in to the match and were cheering me on the whole time. It was the first time they had ever won a match and it was all because of me. \n\nBefore that match, I had never won either in the new competitive matches and I only had one total kill; but none of that mattered, because for one glorious, hectic match, I was a champion and it felt good.\n\n",

        "text": "I kind of have to share this because I did it impromptu during last night's session and still feel bad irl. I also posted this in /r/Dnd because I want to hear your guys's NPC torture stories!\n\nSo last night's sesh begins with me just having tied up a Blackbrand (bad-guys) official so we can bring him to the resistance for questioning. He tells me that they will \"wipe your kind off this planet\" (referring to spellcasters) which pissed me off since my village of casters was destroyed by this Empire in secret. The Barbarian (and the only one with a consistent moral compass in the party) makes a remark and the official spits in his eye. The Barbarian goes into a rage, and I say \"don't worry, I can handle this.\" Knowing that the elf can be far crueler than him, the barbarian agrees to let me handle the prisoner, blind to his morals at this point.\n\nI cast Ghoul Touch, giving me 30 seconds of time where the man is paralyzed completely. I pull out the man's tongue, and tell him \"When you come to, it'd be in your best interest to keep your tongue out.\" I proceed to pour a single drop of acid onto his tongue. He manages a scream through the paralysis and is put through an agonizing 20-ish seconds. When he regains control, he immediately turns over and starts licking the dirt, causing some small relief and wiping off the remainder of the acid. The man spouts many curses at me, notices the pain, and starts begging for water.\n\nI walk behind a nearby tree, pour out my waterskin, refill it with some Death-Drink (Everclear level alcohol, strongest stuff in-game), and cast Prestidigitation to make it taste like water. I then grab the tip of this man's tongue and pour the alcohol directly onto the dirt-caked acid wound (I see this as both cruel, and good due to the fact that I'm actually disinfecting the wound at this point). The man screams bloody murder and tells me \"That's not water, I've never felt such pain in my life you git!\" I succeed on my bluff check, telling him \"of course it's going to sting, I'm pouring water on a fresh acid wound.\" The man requests more at this point. I give him five hearty gulps of the stuff. He slurs, \"something's not right with this water\" but he seems pretty okay with the effects. He immediately dozes off for easy transport.\n\nTl;dr: Poured acid on a paralyzed guy's tongue causing physical pain, and let him know that he'll die if he puts his tongue back in his mouth causing great psychological stress. He licks dirt to get the acid off, and after he requests water, I pour the equivalent of Everclear that has been magically altered to taste like water onto his tongue. I lie and convince him it's actually water and get him drunk enough to pass out, making him easy to transport.\n\nWhat is your best/most brutal torture story from your games?",

        "text": "[On a mysterious bullshit fantasy world, all was not well](https://redd.it/4bta8c). I mean, it might have been well, but campaigns are based around INTERESTING events, so if anything peaceful was happening, in comes something disasterous to muck it all up. And on today's agenda of things being messed up, some gnomes were cutting down the forest. And not the normal boring \"let's make room for a town\" cutting, either. No, these fuckers were going at it hammer and tongs, with surgical strikes, military precision, and napalm. That's right. They were literally napalming the fluffy bunnies. This was a problem.\n\nAnd the people who it was a problem for three amoral fuckbags, armed to the teeth with dangerous weaponry and poor excuses, along with one very belaguered Responsible Individual. The aforesaid Responsible Individual went by the name of [Ling Ling, and she was a monkey girl who had been saddled with the responsibility of watching over her fellow party members](https://gyazo.com/013756c9faa46ae4ee6d68bb8d4032c0). The next party member was [Jello Shot, the all-consuming slime with a seige cannon and True Strike](http://i.imgur.com/oNuhhTF.gif). Fuckbag number two was [Loki, the half-elf rogue who specialized in lying to people](http://i.imgur.com/LFK6CyZ.png). A lot. And finally, there was [Mister Nibbit, the axe-happy dullahan](http://i.imgur.com/hQGnJ1C.png), AKA Fuckbag Prime (who didn't do much of anything this time).\n\nThese four individuals were loosely aimed at the napalm gnomes, given a hearty slap on the ass, and then everyone in the immediate area dove for cover. The general hope was that the ensuing disaster wouldn't have too big of a blast radius. Ling Ling silently agreed.\n\nSo the party set off, formulating a list of complaints to file with the burn-happy gnomes, but not really having any idea what they were up against, or what they could do about it. They didn't want to get involved in a full-scale war. Amendment: They didn't want to get in a full-scale war that they didn't personally start. So they decided to do some info gathering. Loki was the man for the job, and immediately set about finding a gnomish contact of his from the criminal underworld: An eccentric who looked and acted exactly like [Doctor Insano](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AA8OnP4__Og/hqdefault.jpg). After thoroughly questioning the party about whether they were any sort of law enforcement, then trying to extract their brains out of habit, and poking them with a cattle prod a few times, he gave the party the low-down on the situation. While using Jello Shot as a trampoline. \n\nThe basic jist of it was, all gnomes were some form of batshit insane. Insane in the name of SCIENCE and with curiosity that makes them gleefully poke big red buttons labelled \"do not push\". And so, when one gnome had taken the Gnome Throne in the traditional MAD SCIENTIST BATTLE for gnome dominance, he had promptly gone off the stupid end and declared war on nature. For being anti-progressive. The reasoning wasn't terribly important, but the fact of the matter was, the gnomes were going along with it because it meant they got to field-test their death rays, and the whole business would probably stop if they took out the crazy leader. But not just in any old manner, no- the only way they could order the gnomes to do anything was if they defeated the current ruler in a *MAD SCIENTIST BATTLE*.\n\nInformation in hand, the party marched off, shortly after firing Insagnome 500ft into the air with a seige cannon. They then sidestepped the massive, amsuing conflict between the strangely unified forest creatures and the well-armed but hodgepodge gnomes. That brought them right up to the front gates of the giant mechano-whatsit that served as the gnomes' base of operations.\n\nNot being complete idiots, the first thing the party did upon arriving was check for traps. And boy howdy, was that ever a good idea. They found a set of traps so thorough, pointless and over-the-top that it actually wrapped around and started being darkly impressive- especially once they started hucking rocks onto the sensors and watching the elaborate chain reactions. Unfortunately, though, that sort of stuff drew attention, and some gnomish guards showed up to yell mean things at the party and tell them to stay the hell out. One cannonball from Jello Shot later, shit was on. The gnomes had little electrical death-rays which didn't do too much damage, but hit with touch attacks and attacked in large numbers (that occasionally exploded). With this clearly established, the party decided that brute force and \"stealth\" had failed, so it was time to try Lying.\n\n&gt; JELLO SHOT: \"**MAD SCIENTIST BATTLE!**\"\n\n&gt; LING LING: \"I liked it better when you were quiet.\"\n\nAfter some fast-talk from Loki, and some begruding disarmament from Jello Shot and Nibbit, the gnomes gathered up into a big circle and went to grab Kixzix, the especially nutty Lord of the Gnomes. Kixzix then proceeded to go on an entirely unnecessary rant about how lame the forest was, how he liked the color purple, and how Slimes were scum of the earth that devoured electronics and were generally worthless. Seemingly oblivious, he spoke to Loki at length, telling him all about his plans to raze the forest, defeat the inhabitant spirit, install a mechanical metropolis, have tea, exterminate all slimes everywhere, and then invent some sort of autonomous sword that lived underwater and stabbed unauthorized swimmers. Two things became immediately apparent. One, Kixzix was nuttier than an entire septic tank filled with woodland animal defecation, and two, Jello Shot was ominously aiming his cannon, wobbling violently, and turning a funny shade of olive. Jello Shot finally snapped when Kixzix casually mentioned covering the entire burned-down forest with Alkali (anti-slime chemical), and fired his cannon.\n\nKixzix might have been completely fucking batnut bugshit crazy, but he wasn't particularly stupid or unobservant. He'd been watching Jello the entire time, and the moment he went for that shot, Kixzix sprung into action, dodged to the side, and pulled out his mighty chainsaw. That's right. Motherfucker had a chainsaw, and it was larger than he was. And, in violation of every safety protocol ever, it was covered with Alkali. His first move with said chainsaw was to get in close, hack at Jello Shot, and forcibly seperate him from his favorite cannon.\n\nJello Shot was PISSED. Unfortunately, though, he was hilariously outclassed. The crazed Kixzix had spent months operating on rampant paranoia about forest creatures, particularly slimes, and many of the usual slime tricks (being immune to physical damage, redonkulous strength, excellent grapple, ridiculous weapons) all flew out the window because the opponent had outmaneuvered him. His only options were trying to engulf the nutty gnome, which would be a bit like trying to stop a running blender by jamming his face into the blades, or admitting defeat. So Jello Shot ran. And while Kixzix hounded him and decimated his health, Jello Shot barely managed to slip away, out of the foretress, and forefeit the MAD SCIENTIST BATTLE. Except that now his hit point total was something like -10.\n\nAfter the rest of the party had finished applauding and eating their popcorn, they decided it might be wise to go check on their gooey friend.\n\nJello Shot blearily awoke in an algae-filled pond, with a [myserious cloaked figure](http://zeldawiki.org/images/thumb/3/3f/MM3D_Poe_Collector_Artwork.png/200px-MM3D_Poe_Collector_Artwork.png) watching over him. He blearily remembered some bit of information mentioned by the Insagnome- this had to be the legendary Forest Spirit, guiding force behind the forest creatures who were fighting against the gnomes. After some creepy dialogue which basically amounted to \"You're a strange creature, but you are a part of nature, so help me drive off these godsdamned gnomes\", Jello Shot had eaten every living thing in a 40-meter radius and was firmly on the side of FUCK GNOMES. When the rest of the party showed up, some more discussion happened, and the creepy spirit was generally distrustful of \"two-legs\", but was willing to accept any help to prevent more napalming.\n\nThen Jello Shot got curious and decided to Detect Magic on the forest spirit. He nearly died.\n\nTurns out, the forest spirit was an ABSURDLY powerful magic-user. It was just that it was really quite rubbish at actually using it. Its most substantial actions thus far were interesting plant growth and strong-arming monsters into fighting gnomes. And none of that worked outside of the spirit's home forest. The gnomes knew this, and were very specifically avoiding stepping into the woods, unless they were pretty on fire at the time. Several ideas were pitched about what to do with this new information, but they were all shot down when Jello Shot tried tapping into the power and got a whallop with a wicked gnarly oak staf. Hands off, bub.\n\nBut all was not lost. With the forest spirit on their side, they could drastically change the tone of the conflict, if they just had the right tool for the job... and, as it turned out, the tool they needed was Jello Shot. See, slimes eat a lot of biomass, but they also leave a trail of goo that makes a fucking FANTASTIC fertilizer. Slimes essentially wandered about leaving trails of saplings, new grass, and fresh spring flowers in their horrible gelatinous wake. But that wasn't exactly foresty stuff. But the party did have a druid friend who specialized in plants, and specifically, plant growth. With that, they formulated the most retarded and amazing plan in all history.\n\n* Step 1: Jello Shot is hit with Enlarge Person and Cheetah's Sprint.\n* Step 2: Jello Shot uses his size and speed to devour the entire goddamn forest.\n* Step 3: Jello Shot runs around the Gnome mechano-whatsit at just under the speed of sound, leaving a trail of nutritious slime on the ground, as well as various plant seeds.\n* Step 4: The NPC druid accelerates the growth of the plants, and the Forest Spirit chips in to turn it into a brand new green wonderland.\n* Summary: Literally take the forest and move it somewhere else.\n\nAnd boy fucking howdy did it ever work, and it freaked the everloving SHIT out of all the poor gnomes who thought they were winning this particular war. With that, the final phase of their plan went into effect... The Forest Spirit walked up to the front door of the gnomes' fortress, and screamed in a deep, bellowing voice...\n\n\"***MAD SCIENTIST BATTLE!***\"\n\nIt was on. Kixzix the crazy gnome came out of his fortress, ominously revving his chainsaw. The forest spirit glared at him and waved his oaken staff. Then, battle was joined! Kixzix won initiative, charged forward, and hacked at the spirit- but to no effect! It seemed that the spirit had got one over on the gnome and was projecting an illusion! The forest spirit retaliated with vine growths, which Kixzix dodged away from and hacked at mercilessly. Kixzix struck, missed again, and nearly struck a nearby mouse who was in the wrong place at the wrong time. The Forest Spirit put on its game face, raised its arms, and dropped three fully-grown trees directly onto Kixzix's head.\n\nTKO.\n\nAnd with that, the forest spirit's illusory form vanished, and a small deer mouse climbed atop the pile of fallen trees, and declared itself proven Alpha of the pack of gnomes.\n\nThe gnomes were okay with this. But the party surruptitiously suggested keeping the creepy humanoid illusion up, because it was really hard to take a magical squeaky deer mouse seriously. With that all taken care of, the party collected money from a few betting pools that the gnomes had set up, forced the stunned Kixzix into psychiatric care, then dusted their hands and went home. But not before Jello Shot charged back into the gnomish fortress to get his freakin' cannon back.\n\nFrom that point on, Jello Shot would always go out of his way to distrust and harass any gnomes he came across. Nobody fucks with Jello Shot's food, or Jello Shot's cannons.\n\n[NEXT EPISODE!](https://redd.it/4fbzlr)",

        "text": "[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/4d0mqm/a_decent_fellow_pt_1/)\n\nI've realized I will have to use something other than classes to designate the other players due to a rather high turnover for characters. So a quick breakdown:\nJill=dead bard in last entry\nSam=currently the sorcerer\nDan=currently a rogue\nAnd me playing Kerg, the half-orc \"fighter\"\n\nNow, back to the story\n\nKerg had regrouped with the party, currently just Sam and Dan, and we had recovered a fist-sized stone, covered in strange markings, which the mayor had requested (on Kerg's behalf), and a couple chests of gold, a sizeable portion of which was slipped into Kerg's bag of holding prior to the \"fair\" distribution. Sam rolled a 20 on a perception check later on, and noticed the missing gold, but chose not to tell the party. His glance at Dan following reading the DMs note gave me a fun idea, but that is a later story. For now, we will learn of the second death.\n\nIt had been a couple sessions, Jill was now the Barbarian, we had picked up a Ranger, Rick, a guy we'd played with before, and who I knew wouldn't mind an early death. So Kerg had the mayor send us off on a \"kill the beast\" quest, but first, we each got to choose a weapon from the city armory. And there was a bow waiting for him, wonderfully described by the DM so as not to raise suspicion.\n\nMost of us got decent, level-appropriate items, though the DM didn't give away exact enchantments without the proper skill check or paying a wizard. The bow was clearly a bit stronger. He was hitting at least 3 lower on the dice than before and causing an extra die of damage. So even when he learned it was cursed, he kept using it.\n\nThen he missed when firing into melee. The arrow sailed past a foe and hit Jill. Nothing serious, but the DM passed him a note. You could've heard a pin drop as we waited for him to finish.\n\n\"Fair enough,\" he said with a sigh. Then he rolled. 15! We all turned to the DM.\n\n\"Sam, you're up.\" And it was dropped, but we all kept eyeing Rick, them hoping to catch on, me waiting for him to fail the Will save.\n\nIt didn't happen. At least, not yet. He was rolling for each in-game hour. After another couple rolls and another battle, we stopped for the night. I took first watch. Two hours on my own. And the DM did have us leave while we slept.\n\nAs soon as they were asleep, I slipped out of my armor, cast a couple spells to keep them out, and moved some of Jill's gold to Dan's pack. Then got my armor back on and let the spells end. Otherwise, a quiet watch. Next up was Dan himself, another quiet watch, but longer than expected. Worrisome, but he'd be gone soon. Then it was Rick. I prayed for anything but a quiet watch. When the DM called for Jill, and just Jill, I had to hold back my excitement. Sam thought she was the only one to wake up to the attack. He wasn't entirely wrong.\n\nRick's first roll was another success, but the second was a blessing from the RNG. He whipped out his bow and fired at Jill. The DM had not required a coup de grace, so she was still alive, and angry. She woke, closed the distance and pummeled him so hard, he was dead in two hits. Not unconscious, dead. It was simple enough to figure out the curse: once the bow hurt someone, it didn't want to stop. I was rather proud of that idea, especially when it played out so well. \nSo we buried the ranger and made it through the rest of the night. As we approached our target, we met Rick's new character, a paladin, already in battle with the beast.\n\nWell this could be a problem...",

        "text": "So the fortune cookie from my last meal said, \"You have a great way with words, you should write something\". Not being one to ignore fortune cookie wisdom, I bring you all a tale of my woes on the way to becoming a sorcerer supreme that one time.\n\nSo in a homebrew setting from before we could afford actual rpg books and we were just sorta winging the whole thing, the party consisted of an archer, a super sneak, and myself as the wielder of magic and swordplay. I was not a magus though, I kept these two practices distant from each other at all times. Having just come off our latest adventure in which we defeated an evil necromancer in not!Duskwood by [slicing his uber-zombie's soul in half then breaking his neck in a surprise round](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/378x09/the_mostly_dead_battlemage_of_the_bleak_woods/), I felt that I wanted my own horde of the undead to command. Solely for good intentions of course. Several months in a grimy basement surrounded by tomes of unspeakable horror later, our group now had a wide selection of summonable zombies, skeletons, and minor liches to pick and choose to assist them in their quest for good or whatever it was we were supposed to be fighting for.\n\nBuffed by an army of the dead and the others getting improved gear, we were ready for our next challenge. Thing is, we didn't feel like defeating some great foe or accomplishing some feat that would put us at the brink. We just wanted to style super hard on some baddies that were unbelievably outmatched with our new stuff. It was a blatant power fulfillment desire but I had been impaled through the chest, eaten, and nearly incinerated in the last two quests we had done so we needed something relaxing for a change.\n\nFortunately,  there was a perfect job for this. The remnants of the very first bandit group we ever defeated together were coming back to raid the starting village. They had been much more difficult when we were just starting out and my only magic ability was creating gusts of wind or sparking fires before collapsing from a massive migraine. But now they're only mage, a squat man named Felix who we all actually kind of liked despite throwing fireballs and collapsing the earth beneath us, had dipped, Archer Bro could headshot a gnat, Super Sneaks was basically invisible, and I could cut souls in half when I wasn't lighting them on fire. Just a nice, relaxing milk and murder run.\n\nWe arrive at starting village and get ready for some fun. We open up our plan with an assassination on the new boss. By which I mean we walked in the front door, Archer Bro shot him in the face with an exploding arrow, and then I flew us out while the bandits were still blinking out brain matter. We figured this would stop any further bandit attacks but instead it prompted them to make one final attack on the village. Splitting up into three convenient groups, one for each of us to dick on. How nice of them.\n\nFifty bandits come out the clearing and are greeted by one man standing by the east forest. I whisper incantations under my breath and cast my spell. One hundred skeletons and a semi-lich rise from the earth and face the bandits. I smile and give the order to \"Rain hell on them\". My undead army stands at attention, readies their weapons...\n\n...and then runs into the forest behind them.\n\n*lolwut*\n\nMy entire army of skeletons has just up and left for no apparent reason. I look back and go silent for a few seconds. Then I start screaming at them to get back here and give chase to my cowardly legion. The bandits, having moved from terrified to confused to amused, decide to chase after the supposedly fleeing mage so they can bash his face in and take his stuff instead of attacking the village. So now it's a three way chase through the forest with a hundred skeletons fleeing for some unknown reason in the front, a mage so angry he's forgotten that he can fly or teleport in the middle, and fifty thugs out for mage blood bringing up the rear. The chase lasted for about a mile before I caught up. I entered a small clearing and noticed that my army had stopped running, then I forgot how to breathe for a few seconds while I processed the scene. The bandits caught up in that time but did the exact same thing when they saw my undead. Behind the skeletal army was a large planar portal, and every one of them was carrying a large ball of magma over their heads.\n\nYou see, undead are not very smart. When you give one an order, they follow the letter but not the spirit of it because they can't comprehend things like metaphors or subtlety. So when I told them to \"rain hell\", that is exactly what they were going to do. When they were given that order, they retreated to a location where the semi-lich could safely summon a portal to the rivers of hell. From there, they scooped up the hellfire, shaped it into manageable sizes, then waited for their targets to arrive so they could rain actual hell on them. God dammit you stupid skeletons.\n\nI come back to my senses as the first balls of hellfire are being chucked at the stunned bandits and teleport to safety. The bandits are crushed and melted,along with a good portion of the forest being burned down in the aftermath, and the semi-lich comes over to me to report that my orders had been carried out perfectly. *sigh*\n\nThe other two finish their groups and come to check on me. When they get there they see a burning forest, a lava flow pouring down the hills, the bones of my army that I had now dispelled, and me sitting on a charred tree stump with my head buried in my hands, screaming internally. Naturally they ask what happened to which I reply that I don't want to talk about it and ask if we can go home now.\n\nSo to all aspiring necromancers out there, good or evil, remember that the undead are usually really really REALLY stupid. If you are incorporating them into some plan of yours, make sure that a sea urchin could understand the instructions. Because if there is **ANY** room for confusion, they will pull the **STUPIDEST** shit on you.\n\nHave a good night everyone. See you the next time I feel motivated by chinese food.",

        "text": "So we had a group of adventurers (A warrior, a Mage, a priest, a rogue, and a bard) who in the course of their adventurers were tasked with killing a dragon.\n\nRewind to last weeks session. Out of game the group is complaining that they never seem to have a challenge. They've decimated goblinoid camps, killed Giants, broken up a thieves guild, solved the problems of what is basically a tri-county area, are are pretty well known within their kingdom for getting shit done. Now the problem isn't challenge per say; the group is so comfortable together and works so well together that they overcome most any problem I set before them. They roll well, they have solid tactics, and they just work very well in a group. \n\nSo I asked them what they wanted. The party is decides they want a dragon hunt and after checking challenge ratings I crafted a side quest that would let them flex their muscles a little.\n\nFast forward. They come to the cave of a red dragon and after a series of unfortunate  rolls and some tactics that I shattered soundly the warrior is down and dying, the priest is trying to heal him so he can keep meat shielding but he's pretty close to dropping too, the Mage is a pile of ashes, and the rogue has third degree burns over 90% of his body and is fading fast.\n\nThis leaves the gnome bard. Now the gnome bard had been a source of some controversy and the butt of several jokes. While he plays his tunes and cashes his experience the team has done most of the heavy lifting with only support work from him thus far. Now their all around level 6 by this point and the bard has been cashing his points most in theatrical skills. His perform is pretty impressive, his bluff is astounding and augmented by a few items they picked up from the thieves guild.\n\nAs the dragon turns to face him the group groans in despair. There is no possible way this bard is going to beat this dragon and they all know it. The dragon is ready to roast him alive when the gnome says.\n\n\"I want to bluff the dragon.\"\n\nDead silence \n\nMe: \"what?\"\n\n\"I want to bluff the dragon. I want to look up at him and yell \"How dare you stand before me! Don't you know who I am?

        "text": "During one of our early sessions whilst exploring a haunted prison the party came across a locked safe in a small room. As this was our first real loot opportunity we were pretty excited and so gathered around our Gnome Rogue Higgs as he attempted to open it. The DM allowed him to just “take 20” and add his bonuses, but it proved to be beyond our capabilities. No big deal, we still have the majority of the prison to explore so we’ll just bookmark this and try to be on the lookout for any keys that might provide access to the safe. While the rest of the party was coming to this perfectly reasonable conclusion Davros the Fighter on the other hand has a more drastic way to solve this problem. He decides to just beat it with his great axe until it pops open. We fail to stop him as the DM gives this little smirk that we would soon come to associate with poor party decisions. So after three strikes the safe pops open and as the DM describes it “various liquids gush out of the safe door as well as several shattered glass flasks that appear to have contained potions of Cure Light Wounds, Lesser Restoration, and Holy Water.” Needless to say the party berated Davros for this act of careless stupidity, as at that point in the campaign those items could have made the difference between dying and living. the incident is now something of a running joke that the party refuses to let Davros live down.",

        "text": "the setup:\n\nwe use Star Hero to run a relatively sandboxy sci-fi campaign with a group of my friends. They are the captain and crew of a private bounty hunting spaceship, but totally do less legal side work as well.\nThe universe is the not extremely distant future, and noteably FTL travel was invented before a single power united the government, as such humanity has split into many smaller empires that are in a state of constant cold war with each other.\n\nThe party has been hired by a fictional \"Sea Shepard\" organization to put a stop to a certain television show that the Sea Shepard people find rather distasteful. Imagine if halfway through an episode of Planet Earth, David Attenborough harpooned the sperm whale he's been filming, dragged it's body alongside his ship, and kept showing and explaining about the whale, now from up close!\"\n\nProblem: The captain is a big fan of this show, so just assassinating this guy is not plan A, so they track and capture him successfully then decide they are going to brainwash him to become an eco-warrior and hunt poachers instead. This is where this start to get crazy.\n\nThey go to a highly techno-industrial planet that just happens to have a local government with serious right-wing tenancies. they find a mad scientist who's been experimenting with mind control. problem: he's been kidnapped by a legit, but extreme political group (brownshirts). so what does the party do? they assault the top secret site the scientist is being held at!\n\nAnd I mean they ASSAULT it, in a pair of armored walkers and a hovertank! they start by crashing un-announced through the roof and blast their way to the basement to extract the doctor.\n\nIt's all over in less than 2 minutes, 19 local security guards brutally murdered, with many guards meeting their end via one of the walkers throwing an APC at them, squishing them under it.  Others received direct fire from the hovertank's main anti-tank weapon, leaving a massive bloody mess behind.\n\nBut more worryingly, in the crossfire they killed a local political figure. not an actual elected official, but a decent analogy for USA folks would be if a Tea Party Vice President was killed by unknown attackers.\n\nand that's where last night's session ended, with them speeding away from the scene with the mad doc recovering in the med bay. The mad doc's kidnapping was definitely not public knowledge and not info the Brownshirts are wanting to share, so to outside appearances an unknown foreign hit squad just murdered a political figure, in an already borderline Fascist state.\n\nShould be interesting times ahead.",

        "text": "I started a gurps 4e campaign with 3 players. Two of them had never played any tabletop games. The third, my wife, has gamed before but only knows bits of the system. During character creation the players are as thus; Noh an elven archer that can read minds with magic from a timeline called Obregon.  Jay a ghoul from a fallout timeline called Helleskir who is mostly a gun bunny and hard to kill.  Finally Evelyn who's backstory is that Jebidiah Stone stole her targeting AI and that became Ironmans Jarvis. She is a Uchronian and from the base timeline Uchronia. The elf and ghoul found themselves accidentally in Uchronia and Evelyn got community service for her failed lawsuit and slander of Stark industries.\n\nThe story starts with them being tested for talents and the one skill they all chose was First Aid, so they became Medic Team 3.  The players quickly learn that they are now timeline jumpers that solve problems from various universes. Oh no they aren't a cool assault team  like the Glitter Boys or Soul Sisters nor as important as the researchers the Iron Riders or Long Walks.  They are instead expected to show up patch people up and stay alive. They are not pleased for the few minutes that they get before a red light go off and they are lead to a Parachronic Capsule and strapped in to be told they are going to Theravada a pacifist timeline. After the stomach churning ride along with some vomiting they get out of the capsule and find themselves next to an assault team. The three person team called the Glitter Boys are waiting to help. Dietrich a combat drug junkie who in passing mentioned he had gotten high and f***ed a brick, Shuck a humanoid dog person who hunts psychics and can't talk and finaly Grundy the huge ghoul who is from the same timeline as Jay the player. \n\nThe Theravedans explain that they have an infestation of monsters that lay eggs in people. Their contact leads them to a hospital that as the players appear people in gowns start fleeing out shouting about monsters carrying other wounded. The players proceed to start helping some of them as the assault team waits for orders.  With a couple of good rolls Non, the elf notices eggs growing as pustules on the infected. She tells the other players and Jay who is the only person that bought more than one language tells the assault team to stop the wounded from fleeing.  This goes poorly. The assault team starts to  do what assault teams do. They start knee capping, ankle biting and pulling thigh bones out of the fleeing innocents. This moment establishes for the players that their roles are very different. After the area was cordoned off and a bunch of first aid / surgery rolls one of the survivors tells them that the top floor where the hospital keeps the elderly hospice patients was unable to flee. The assault team mentions that they aren't here to hold anyone's hands and they haven't seen anything dangerous so two of them are going to a nearby opium den. Shuck the doglike psystalker will wait nearby.\n\nLet's start the rel adventure now. \n\nThe players enter the hospital and keep hearing skittering. The elf, Noh who has bought ridiculous perception tells the team to get ready as she nocks her bow, Jay pulls oiut a revolver made out of a distributor cap and baling wire and Eve pulls out an overpowered laser pointer. The first combat goes in their favor and they start clearing out each floor when they start noticing blood trails as the monsters have been dragging of the infected.  \n\nThe final fight has them surprised and in a crossfire. The adult monsters have piled up the bodies and are using them for cover. Jay the ghoul forgot toncount bullets in his revolver but I didn't. He rushes one with a knife and proceeds to regret it. Good rolls have him at negative HP but functioning. Noh is rocking monsters with arrows and the players are enjoying the Evelyn doing nearly no damage with her laser pointer. They win eventually and get to do some more knowledge checks to see the only good way to get rid of the infestation is with fire. Jay, who's player had never paper gamed before asked \" are there oxygen tanks?\n\nThat's how my players burned a hospital to the ground their first game. What\nThey didn't iknow is that this first game was just forshadowing the Bbeg and they fairly evilish people they worked with. \n\nThe next episode started with them in a 28 day quarenteen.\n\nWant to know more?

        "text": "Back in college (when I was younger and gaming a lot more often), I started what was intended to be a one-off/short run with the old White Wolf Hunters Hunted during our Interim session (basically we had semester-interim-semester; long story, not germane).\n\nSo, 2 of my group of players made up hunters and off we went - one was basically a gun-bunny (ex-IRA, on the run, lots of guns and tactics) and the other was a werewolf (Native American, hand-to-hand fighting, tracker).\nAs part of the set up, we played through a solo scene with each of them that explained why they were now hunters. The werewolf's backstory was basically that he had a decent if sparse life on a reservation until some tourists (who turned out to be some vampires + ghouls in an RV) rolled through, killed his fiancee, and set him on the path to vengeance which is what awoke his werewolf-nature.\n\nWe'd only intended this to be a one-shot, or maybe a week's worth of games. Turned into this thing we were doing 3 nights a week for about a month.     \nAbout 2 weeks in, the PCs are cruising around Vegas trying to piece together some clues when Dave (the wolf) spots what he thinks is his dead fiancee. Standing on a street-corner. Obviously looking like a hooker.\nHe tries to bail out of the moving car, but the other PC hauls him back in. He quickly explains that he's got to deal with this. Car pulls over, out hops the wolf, and back he runs.\n\nHe manages to track her scent (even though it is really off) to an alleyway. Where he's got her cornered. Turns out she is indeed a vampire (though he'd suspected it by this point based on her scent). He's approaching her with a stake, ready for her to attack.\n\nInstead she starts crying, falling to her knees, begging him for forgiveness and pleading with him to kill her. The Player (and his character) are a little stunned. This wasn't how this was going to go in his mind. Behind the PC, the other PC has arrived, along with the scent of gun-oil and the sound of a round being chambered.\n\nThe wolf takes off with his fiancee, takes her up on a rooftop. She explains that the vampires took her, changed her, and have been essentially pimping her out, selling her body so that she can bring in johns who won't be missed for them all to feed from. And she hates it. While she wants her life back, she's too disgusted with what she's become and what she's done, and she just wants it all to end.\n\nBut, she's too scared to do it herself. She's tried, she explains, pulling up one sleeve to show off some horrid looking marks that aren't quite scars. But nothing has worked. Whatever is in her mind makes her stop, or pushes her to do horrible things.     \nSo she wants him to kill her. Out of love for her, for what she was, for what they had.\n\nBy this point, the gun-bunny player has been silent for like 30 minutes while this has been playing out. Really quietly, almost in a whisper, he says, \"Are you gonna do it?\" His voice has a little bit of a quaver to it, like he's choking back emotion.\n\nThe wolf player is almost in tears. He can't even answer at first. He just nods, staring off out one of the windows to the bright sunny afternoon that we'd all forgotten even existed.\n\n\"I'll stake her, but I'm not leaving her. I'll stake her and hold her until sunrise. We'll watch the sun together one last time,\" he says, his voice gaining a little bit of strength with each phrase.\n\n\"Fitting,\" I respond, \"as she had planned for you to say your vows as the sun rose on the res back home.\" (He glared daggers at me and tears filled his eyes.)\n\nI described the wooden stake piercing through her, him holding her cold body that was at once lifeless while her eyes were obviously full of emotion. Then the sun rising, her body starting to smoke, the smoke stinging his eyes and making them blur, then a wind picking up and hot ash swirling around him. Then the soft clatter of the stake landing on the rooftop in front of him.\n\nI described the wind rolling the stake back and forth, ash shaking off of it, falling away, but leaving an image burned into the wood. A simple single flower, just like his fiancee's name.\n\nWe sat there for a moment.\n\nThen I kind of rudely blurted out, \"Hey look it's dinner time, let's head over to the cafeteria.\" I think that Dave was fighting back tears the whole way there.",

        "text": "In the ongoing saga of myself and some friends learning to play D&amp;D I still have two players. The monk's player is still very cooperative in creating the story and letting me know what he'd like to do. The rogue's player still has his moments of being completely unhappy when he doesn't get to narrate the world but is getting better. Sort of.\n\nWhen we left our party they'd just killed off a gang that had tried to rob them in an inn. The monk went down in the fight as well as the (unable to hit an 11 AC with +6 to hit) NPC warlock. Rogue survived by the skin of his teeth and the third session ended. At the start of the fourth session a couple of those bandit's friends ambushed the party and NPC being first out the door took a couple crossbow bolts. \n\nMade it up the road back to that farm, saw the farmer's wife giving him hell for thinking that the pig was magical. Rogue immediately offers that it was them and more specifically the monk that told him this, wife asks them to go look at it and reassure her husband that it's not actually magical. Cue fight with a dozen awakened shrubs. Rogue is rolling hot but the shrubs are resistant to piercing. Party then decides that they'll kill the pig, monk rolls a nat 1 to attack it so rogue also goes in, cuts its snout off revealing that it is in fact a demon of some sort. After dealing with the demon the rogue decides they need to be rewarded, farmers have one pig left and the party gets one pig which lasts until they make it back to camp and then gets eaten.\n\nAt dinner the rogue has to go tell everyone what just happened, rogue's player gets pissy when the NPCs tell him he doesn't need to write a report, just tell other NPC who sterilizes things and writes a joint report for the entire unit. Player declares that I just killed his imagination because I didn't let him monologue to multiple NPCs for several minutes each. Monk's player tries very hard not to audibly facepalm. Party then has a couple of downtime days to do whatever, notable happenings include the monk drinking and the rogue trying to barter with the clerk at the quartermaster's tent. The rogue's player is still unhappy that he doesn't get to roll persuasion before the clerk tells him that there are no magical items available and none being made in the camp. Through the magic of talking to the guy that can write up supply requests the rogue procures another shortsword and shortbow and the rogue's player gets unhappy when it's not better than the one he already has. Decides he'll spend the rest of the time brooding. Monk drinks and recovers and is issued a quarterstaff because reasons.\n\nParty recieves orders to temporarily attach to a siege weapons unit and start by taking part in a parade, during which the rogue keeps his hood up so nobody recognizes him. Combat demonstrations are a fun part of every parade so party with a new NPC fight ten or so reskinned cultists. Rogue's player gets pissy when the monk's player doesn't blindly run forward, monk's player doesn't want to get engulfed and beaten down in the first round. Rogue's player gets sulky when he sees that the NPC is a hunter (half-orc, sword and board) because he was thinking about being a hunter before he decided to be a rogue. After the parade the party becomes scouts for the unit as it moves in friendly territory and the session ends on the party hearing something in the distance.\n\nNext session picks up with the promise of another player in the coming session so we're going to spend a session on less consequential things. Party sees monks carrying a crying child, rogue's player announces that he's just not into it right now and asks me what was happening. I repeat it and he still isn't paying as much attention to what I'm saying as he is to texts so we move on. Combat happens during which the rogue's player continually whines about the lack of a map and that I don't tell him he becomes invisible when he rolls to hide. Party takes down a hobgoblin and the worg it was riding and the rogue's player spends ten minutes talking about how it would have been cool to have animal handling and take the worg (because that would have happened) then complains about how he's not really that good in combat and it's not working like he thought it would. I tell him to go ahead and pick one of the other archetypes if assassin wasn't what he wanted and then his attention became divided three ways between the game, his phone, and figuring out spells.\n\nParty eventually made their way to town. Rogue at this point has decided he wants to get his cursed dagger made into a shortsword, finds the smith in town and said smith is incapable of holding on to the dagger so it's not going to work. Rogue begins to get huffy about this and the party makes its way to a shop. Rogue's player becomes unhappy with the cost of health potions, rogue convices the shopkeep to trade a heavy crossbow he'd looted for a potion. Rogue also asks the shopkeep about smiths that might be able to make his dagger a shortsword, shopkeep suggests his brother that works at the forge they'd already been to and then offers that they might need to find a dwarven smith.\n\nMonk signs up for a fight at the tavern they end up at, fights the half-orc NPC and just barely wins. The player became really engaged with this which was nice. Rogue looks for a dwarf and rogue's player has his imagination killed yet again when the dwarf in the \"literally a fight going on in the corner\" bar is a carvan guard not a smith. Rogue is pointed to a classier tavern, the Red Wagon. \n\nRogue makes his way up the street to the Red Wagon, rogue's player asks if he can just climb in, I get confused, we work out that this is a tavern, not an actual wagon, and the rogue heads inside to look for a dwarf. This time he finds a dwarven smith (natural 20 on perception let him see that one of the two dwarves was a smith and the other sitting with him was a merchant). As I start to describe them he cuts me off and says he wants to talk to the bartender. The bartender talks to him, he says he wants to buy a barrel of ale for the dwarf sitting in the corner. Bartender asks if he's trying to buy them a drink and he cuts me off again but this time in character. Bartender calls for the proprietor and rogue's player gets pissy that he's not going to be trying to persuade the (female) bartender but is instead dealing with the (male) proprietor. Long story short the rogue ends up buying the remaining 1/3 barrel that had already been tapped because he's cheap and bar staff carry it over to the dwarves who are drinking wine. I've killed his imagination one more time and he no longer wants to do this and I'm picking on him. Anyway, the rogue gets his cursed dagger made into a cursed shortsword and the rogue's player is unhappy that it has all the same properties, it just does 1d6 instead of 1d4.\n\nThe next day the party goes, at the suggestion of the NPC they've been traveling with, to try to find work because they're supposed to be establishing themselves as mercenaries after they cross the border. Orders have them waiting for a scribe (I was waiting for another third player to start the next arc) but they might as well earn some money while they wait. A half-orc offers them a job looking tough, says he'll be back in an hour to get them. Not long after he leaves a little girl walks up and asks them to find her missing dog, offers them 3 copper. They spend a few minutes looking at the immediate area, talk to some people, learn about some dog fighting being run out of the warehouse district. Party heads to the warehouse district, ask a merchant that the rogue happens to know from dealings in the capital. Rogue's player is pissy that the merchant doesn't remember the rogue or offer him any respect. Merchant points them to a specific warehouse where they open the front door and notice a man sleeping in a chair and boxes piled to the ceiling.\n\nRogue's player asks if they hear dogs, which they don't, and then rogue kicks in the door. The guy sleeping inside is startled awake and yells at them that it's private property and to go away so the rogue throws a dagger, killing the guy. Party then investigates the area (natural 20) revealing that the floor is relatively undisturbed dirt and the boxes seem to fit together almost too well. Rogue's player asks if that's all they get on a natural 20 to investigate and begins to ramp up to full blown temper tantrum. Rogue tells the monk to hit the crate, which the monk does, putting a nice hole in it and revealing that it is stuffed full of wool. I remind the rogue's player that he has a crowbar and they pop in one side of the crate and out the other into the back area of the warehouse. \n\nRogue hears dogs, heads to look for the one they're looking for, and kills all the dogs because they look like they've been used for fighting and none of them are the one they're after. Rogue's player then takes a phone call and is out for 40 minutes. Monk heads up some stairs, catches a larger humanoid by surprise, uses flurry of blows and kills the person in three hits. Rolling the body over the monk learns that this is the person that had hired them. Some searching later the monk finds a safe and then we wait patiently for the rogue's player to get back. Rogue attempts to unlock the safe, declares that he's failed (total of 11), and wouldn't you know it the safe pops open. Nobody ever tried opening it to begin with, it was unlocked. Party notices that they have company downstairs and make their way out through the unlocked upper back door. Head back to the NPC who eventually decides that their employer must not be coming and they all make their way back to the tavern. Throw in one group fight at the end for good measure and the session finishes. \n\nBetween sessions I make a note that the poor little girl made a horrible decision asking them to find her dog because within 20 minutes of asking them for help they'd killed her dad. At the start of the next session the NPC they'd been with isn't there anymore. The rogue asks around the bar about the dog then demands to insight check everyone in the bar. Nobody had seen that dog but some of them did note that there had been a dogfight that was shut down the day before. Then the rogue asks around about the NPC who he was told was handed something by a little man and left earlier that morning. Rogue's player announced that those were his orders and nobody knew what he was talking about. Leaving the tavern they see a familiar face from the camp, the scribe they'd been told to wait for. Rogue's player was confused when he was told that the other NPC had gone ahead to the gate until the monk's player reminded him that the NPC's orders had been to take up a position at the gate. Rogue sees the girl being led away by some monks, goes to question them as to what they're doing while putting one hand on his weapon. Mercifully he accepts that they're going to take care of her because he parents are both dead and he reassures her that he'll find her dog. \n\nParty becomes caravan guards as a cover for crossing the border, deal with some giant goats standing on the road (by being annoying enough that the goats left the road) and makes it through the outgoing gate because the merchant had appropriate paperwork. The monk is, at this point, riding shotgun on the first cart with the rogue riding in the covered back of the third one, only capable of seeing behind them. The carts stop at the inbound gate to the next country and the party sees the NPC they'd been traveling with is now working as a border agent for the other country. Monk hops to the side where their friend was screening as he and another man walked back along the line, talking to the people then looking in the carts. Rogue stands directly behind the third of four carts. Everyone was asked two questions: Do you have anything illegal and Are you a wanted criminal. Monk gets the point and answers no to both questions. Rogue asks what's illegal and notes that he has weapons which he is told are perfectly legal, these are dangerous times. Rogue also stumbles on the question of if he's a wanted criminal. Volunteers that he's not wanted anymore because he joined the army. Volunteers that this was not in the past, he's an active member of the army. Volunteers that he's under orders to cross the border. The man that the party didn't know writes this down and the last cart and its occupants are also checked and questioned. Some more official looking men come and ask the rogue to follow them, which he does. He offers that the monk is also in the army, monk's player decides he'll go along to keep the rogue's player from whining that he left him again. The party is led into one of the gate towns and thrown forcefully into a cell. Rogue's player then asks me if this happened without a fight and I tell him you just followed them voluntarily and they're strong enough to make you get in that cell. Rogue's player starts to get pissy again, a few hours in game later someone comes in to release them because bribery works wonders.\n\nThe caravan makes its way to the first town across the border and stops at an inn. Monk decides he'll trance out inside and rogue sleeps on the ground outside because they're protecting the caravans. Combat without a map starts yet again and the rogue's player becomes thoroughly confused. Hostiles are outside visual range shooting arrows, rogue's player asks if there are any rocks nearby and holds his arms apart as if he were talking something large enough to hide behind. He then casts light on a torch and throws it. Realizing that he meant small rocks to act as lights he tosses the next one to the monk, I have him roll an attack roll to see if it actually gets to the monk and the rogue's player is again incredibly confused because he doesn't want to attack the monk. Monk dashes and makes a running jump to hit the next closest cover 100 feet out, rogue's player is pissy that he can't get to that cover in one turn, I tell him he can get to another bit of cover that's not directly towards the hostiles. Monk tosses the lit stone in the direction of the hostiles and works his way around behind the building he's by to try to advance while keeping cover. Hostiles decide now is a great time to leave and sneak away. Nobody can see them, nobody can see tracks if they even made any, combat is over and nobody actually got hit.\n\nIn the morning the party gets tasked with securing an abandoned, rumored to be haunted estate as a home base for their new mercenary company. This was only about 1/3 or 1/2 way through the session but I'm going to cut it here and let the events in and around the estate have their own post when the party finishes clearing the estate.",

        "text": "**The continued tale of Malaney Belrue.** [Click here for previous chapter.](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/4cbqnw/dnd_5e_great_bouts_of_change_pt_5/)\n\n*Ojtejk La’Dwa ab Jujnis, 2997*\n\nAnother curious day to recall. First it started with waking to Kimaris helping with breakfast. In the times I’ve traveled with him, never has he so much as lifted a finger to help with camp. I watched him as he and Fern worked together over the fire. As I brushed my hair, I noticed the boy walk over to Bordel and converse for a bit. His face was rather solemn, if not serious. \n\nOnce I was properly dressed, I joined the lot around the fire. That was when Kimaris presented me a bouquet of daisies. More surprisingly, he said sorry. That was something I thought he’d never say, I having accepted his interest in teaching me to fight as his apology. I’m not sure if I’m being a fool by believing his sincerity, but there was something about his eyes, and the fact he was acting very different than usual, that convinced me to give him a chance.\n\nThough breakfast was less than satisfactory, it wasn’t the worst meal I’ve eaten. Soon we were well on our way toward Ruebis. While we walked, I explained what my plan was for retrieving the journals. The bottom line was getting me into my mother’s home without being caught. Doing so would involve Kimaris presenting himself as a noble in his rich dress. The boy, who I thought would have taken serious pride in being the center of attention, mentioned he’d rather find a new outfit, for the current was too grand for him.\n\nAgain, I was very surprised by the change of heart I was seeing, but I encouraged him to enjoy the outfit long enough to get me into my mother’s home. Bordel would play the part as his guard, Fern and I as his handmaids, and Oda as the scout. The Halfling had some objection to being a handmaid, she not looking the part, but I told her the idea mainly is to present ourselves as workers for Kimaris.\n\n“But, what am I even to say?” the boy asked.\n\n“Let alone, do you really think we’d be able to convince anyone with your plan?” Bordel questioned.\n\nI explained that all we’d need to do is have Kimaris simply state that he had come on behalf of Lord Remus Trophe to discuss matters of trade with Lady Belrue. They were quite skeptical, but I assured them that often people were coming and going on matters of trade with my family. My father was responsible for the treasuries and with that came the overseeing of commerce. \n\nAs we discussed, Oda pointed out smoke in the distance. Kimaris, with Fern’s bird, went off to investigate. I was impressed how fast the boy could run. About ten minutes later, Fern informed us we needed to go check the place out. It sounded to have been a raided settlement.\n\nWhen we arrived, the small village certainly was in disarray. Bordel went to find Kimaris while I followed Fern to the well. Her bird was concerned by it, and good reason, though I wish we hadn’t investigated it.\n\nOnce the Halfling and I drew close to the well, a toy bear began to call out to us, asking for it’s mommy. Actually, it was addressing Fern specifically. The voice became more urgent as she mentioned how cold and wet she was.\n\n“Daddy put me in the well. Where’s my mommy?” the teddy bear lamented. I had barely begun to think about searching the well when Kimaris disappeared over the edge. I called after him and a moment later, as all of us (including Bordel) leaned over to see, heard the boy announce he had the girl.\n\nQuickly we got Kimaris out. He laid the bluish girl on the ground and suddenly I had to stop. I went to touch her cold face when my mind was flooded with the injustice that she wasn’t Exalted and the fact that she appeared to be around Araja’s age. Rapidly I walked away, walking toward the house to brace myself. I had hoped the others would have left me be, but Kimaris was next to me asking what was wrong.\n\n“The little girl reminded me of someone. A painful memory to recall.”\n\nHis response: \"I understand.\"\n\nKimaris then left me alone. \n\nI had regained my nerves by the time the others had finished dealing with the possessed teddy bear and burying the girl. I was more than ready to go, my home town not seeming as daunting after that. Yet approaching the gates proved long enough to get my nerves going again. Thankfully Kimaris stated the intent of our stay as planned and we were allowed entrance without further squabble.\n\nAs we walked along, Fernwood insisted a stop at the money exchanger. Unfortunately my older brother happened to be heading in. I barely managed to jump behind Bordel and Kimaris to evade him. As we waited on Fern, I explained to the men why I jumped so.\n\nThe Halfling returned shortly, pointing out she met with my relation. I not caring, other than getting off the streets, then directed the group to the Boar’s Head Inn. It wasn’t as fine as the Golden Swan, but people would have recognized me there. Plus we couldn’t pull off our story of being a noble party if we stayed in anything less than the finer Inns.\n\nBordel got Kimaris and myself a room, I being his handmaiden, which I will admit put a blush in my cheeks. But I wasn’t afraid either. The whole morning Kimaris has been so different. It’s hard to believe it was only yesterday he had hurt me so.\n\nFernwood and Oda got a room together, breaking the group up so as to draw less attention to ourselves, but I have yet to see them. So far it’s been just me and Kimaris in our room. I am trying very hard not to take it in too much. The warm room, chairs to sit in, and soon lunch to be on it’s way, all fond reminders of my past life.\n\nSomething else to note about Kimaris, he’s younger... As Bordel left us in the room to go settle himself in next door and fetch our afternoon meal, I tried making small talk with Kimaris, but he was already in a corner pouting. I asked what was wrong and he mentioned feeling ashamed.\n\nI was taken aback at the remorse he had. I’d be lying if I didn’t say I felt something. And so I patted his shoulder, telling him that we all make mistakes. He looked me in the eyes and, who I thought was my age, looked much younger. A sting of disappointment that I was developing feelings for a young boy shot through me. I can only hope my smile didn’t falter.\n\nThen again... isn’t Kimaris suppose to be older than me? Even if that were so, I don’t think it wise to think of him any more than a friend. Maybe a brother... it’s all rather confusing...\n\nWell, to show I held no ill feelings toward him, I found a cup of water and placed the daisies Kimaris gave me that morning in it. It was quite thoughtful of him to even consider such a peace offering.",

        "title": "TIFU by sending my campaign details to the wrong person",
        "author": "FriendsCallMeAsshole",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/4dbtle/tifu_by_sending_my_campaign_details_to_the_wrong/",
        "text": "Okay, I originally wrote this as a post for /r/TIFU, but sadly the mods deleted it. Bullshit I say, but what are you gonna do.\n\nI hope people here will appreciate it more, even though it's not strictly about the events of the campaign itself, but more about the meta-events surrounding it.\n\nAnyway, here I go:\n\n---\n\nOkay, a few things first, because I'm sure I'll get yelled at about those: \n\n1. This TIFU didn't happen today. The forwarding of my notes actually happened about a year ago, but the consequences of my mistake only started to unfold today, so I'll take the artistic freedom of still labeling this as \"Today I fucked up\".\n2. DnD (Dungeons &amp; Dragons) is used synonymously to 'tabletop RPG' in this context. I do this because people have a vague idea what Dungeons and Dragons is (from references in pop culture, etc.), but not necessarily what a tabletop-game is. I'll explain the finer details a bit further down, just wanted to point this out.\n3. I don't have many friends who share my interest in make-believe games and roleplaying. I won't accept people making fun of them in any way with your 'witty' remarks like \"lel, more like TIFU by being an adult playing children-games\". Sorry, I said it first, now you're not original anymore, so why not just shut the fuck up?\n\nAnyway, to the actual story. As I said, I play tabletop and pen&amp;paper games. It started when I was younger, and I played some games of DnD and Das Schwarze Auge (german p&amp;p game), and expanded when I got my first PC (because my campaigns were always longterm anyway, so it didn't make much difference whether you played it with friends or online via forum posts. Yes, such systems do exist).\n\nIn many ways the adventuring wasn't what interested me though, it was the worldbuilding. Writing two pages of backstory for your character? Boring, try creating a family-tree with unique backstory for each family member and trying to deduce how their personal philosophies and stances on important topics would influence the personal believes held by their children. Indirect character-creation is what I called it.\n\nObviously, the less detailed of a world you started out with, the more you could create on your own. However some things got old pretty fast. There are only so many ways you can arrange landmass, there are only so many religions one can create before they start to resemble one another, etc. etc.\n\nSo, to get rid of my boredom, I tried something new: Collaborative worldbuilding. (One of my more recent attempts actually can be found here on reddit, so quick shoutout to /r/conglomera)  \nHere, instead of doing everything on my own, I would allow other people to lay the groundworks, and then just roll with it, add details whereever it seemed to fit and when it was fun to do so.\n\nHowever this quickly became too tedious for me (I don't really have great moderating abilities I'm afraid), and I ended up wasting much of the time I actually wanted to spend on being creative on managing the contributions of other people. So with that, this particular chapter ended.\n\nBut here's where I learned a lesson, which will have disastrous consequences later.\n\nI noticed how much fun it was to roll with existing groundwork and simply expand on certain things. I could simply leave certain topics which don't particularly interest me (e.g. races, religions, science), and instead focus on topics which I held great interest in (e.g. politics, economics, military).\n\nSo, how does one gather information to base your campaign on? Well, you could simply steal the worlds written by other people. Great idea in theory, but more often than not they have some really big plotholes, which make making logical storytelling hard. So I instead copied an idea from alternative history books: I simply took a 'screenshot' of the real world at a random date, and then developed the story further based on the data given at that time.\n\nAnd for this particular campaign I selected the modern world, to be more precise, the 2010's.\n\nI took the real world and started my singleplayer-campaign (because no matter how forgiving some of my friends are, a purely economy and politics based campaign was too nerdy even for them), and started having a go at it. I controlled my character, a small banker, and started earning money left and right. I influenced markets, traded with insider-information and did many questionable things, which not always worked out (but sometimes I natural 20'd it).\n\nSoon I started to introduce more characters to keep me occupied, and to generate more ideas. I created fictional characters, I entered really existing people and gave them 'NPC' status, and everything got increasingly complicated.\n\nTo keep track of my own story, I started to document everything in digital form (the mountains of paper quickly becoming unmanagable, so PDFs and so on were the only choice I had). I wrote biographies for every character, filled out alignement sheets, clarified relationships between characters by writing short stories of conversations between them, I made up fictional paperwork for companies managed by my characters (at this point I should mention that I study informatics, obviously I automated lot of the paperwork creation even I'm not crazy enough to write the entire tax history of several dozen individuals. Think of it like markov chains for tax-work. All I had to do was read over them and correct a few things to make them look reasonable enough for my purposes).\n\nAnyway, it was a lot of fun, and so I told a few friends about it. Most found it cool too (not that they wanted to join, but reading the stories I made up was still interesting), only one of my friends who goes by the nickname 'SubZero' asked whether he could join in.\n\nNow, while I loved economics and politics aswell as roleplaying, SubZero was on a whole different calliber when it came to roleplaying. The topics didn't matter to him, as long as he could enter the role of a person. His most recent craze was ARGs (alternate reality games, in case that wasn't obvious), like those used to promote videogames like Portal in viral marketing attempts. ARGs often made a huge effort to blur the lines between what's real and what is fake, and SubZ breathed this pseudo reality.\n\nSo when I invited him, he went a step further and started to expand our campaign individuals into the 'real world'. Facebook-accounts for NPCs, twitter-accounts for the marketing-departments of the companies of our world, email-adresses for every person part of my (I still think of it as 'my') campaign. And then he posted as these people, sent mails as these people, wrote tweets as those people. \n\nSubZero, like me, studies informatics (which is actually how I know him, we share some lectures), and so he too automated some of those things, to increase the amount of information he could push through these channels. He wrote chatbots using the twitter-API, created bots posting things for him on facebook, bots that automated email-traffic and so on. Often he did it by modelling characters after really existing people and simply making a bot copy their posts, replace the name of the person, and then repost it.\n\nAnyway, for a campaign only run by two people, the amount of worldbuilding we were doing was ludicrous. I'm talking about thousands of character-sheets, hundreds of thousands of automatically generated tweets and status updates, etc.\n\nAnd that's where the TIFU happened.\n\nMy harddrives were slowly reaching full capacity from all the bullshit we were producing, and I was worried that my very unwise practice of never keeping backups would soon backfire, and so I set up a small homeserver, loaded a backup of all my campaign files and personal notes onto it, and then sent the login-data for the server to SubZero, so he could also store his data on the server.\n\nSubZero. Keyboard-shortcut in my messaging-software: SZ.\n\nOnly that on that particular day I apparently had highlighted not the searchbar for my friendlist, but the general searchbar, and so the message didn't reach SubZero, but instead the first result you get when searching for SZ in Germany:\n\nThe Süddeutsche Zeitung.\n\nI never noticed what happened until yesterday evening. Suddenly I read about this big leak, those 'panama papers', with 2.6 Terrabyte of data.\n\nI'm intrigued, so I check it out, and that's when I go into shock:\n\nThere, on the frontpage of several big international newspapers are the details my DnD campaign.\n\nI don't know what to do. This is beyond fucked up, I feel like I destroyed the lives of an uncountable amount of people, just because of a small fuckup on my part.\n\nI don't know how to fix this, how to stop this. It looks so beyond repair, but I guess I have to try. God, I just hope I can stop all of this before they release the alignement sheets on Dick Cheney and the Bush family, the 9/11 involvement-accusations look like childplay compared to what I thought up.\n\nTL;DR: I fucked up by sending login-data to personal campaign-information to the wrong person, because of a similiar abbreviation of the username.",

        "text": "Hello again! This is a continuation of 'What we are in the Shadows Part 8 (Flower Power)', which you can find here: https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/4bcadp/shadowrun_what_we_are_in_the_shadows_part_8/. I apologise for taking so long but this is the grand finale for this campaign and I wanted to take my time in writing it as it deserves. Last time, our team of tenacious misfits managed to complete their most dangerous task yet: The infiltration of a heavily fortified megacorp facility. Having sucessfully retrieved the awakened flower from it's blowhole perch,\nthe group reconvened at back at the barn. Unknown to the others, there were dire consequences for fulfiling their task. This is where we find ourselves as of now.\n\nSeveral days had passed since the Punakaiki mission and Nellie was feeling awful. Her body was wracked with terrible tremors, her skin had started to glow with a sheen of sweat and a powerful fever had started burning through her.\nWhile she had done her best to hide the effects from her friends, it was becoming clear that something was very wrong. It came to a head when Leilani discovered the former event planner passed out in her bed, without a hint of colour in \nher body. After the others were alerted, they gathered around their insensate comrade. Nellie's form had been leached of all tone, turning the colour of white chalk. More worringly, her bones seemed to have begun moving around her body.\nThe calcium structures had turned the consistency of jelly, sliding free of their typical positions. As one might expect, the others were freaking the fuck out.\n\n\"Holy shit! What the fuck happened to Nellie!?\" Hautangi could not help staring at the colourless woman laid out before him, even as he swore up a storm. Leilani started checking Nellie over, the bi-cardiac completely confused by these\nsudden and horrific changes. Poindexter braced himself for another period of observation, flinching as he remembered the days of 'melting-skin Leilani' and 'Darth Hautangi'. \"I don't know if this is better or worse than what happened \nto you.\" Hautangi mused to Leilani, either oblivious or uncaring of her growing rage. Regardless, he recoiled in pain when she smacked him across the head. \n\n\"How about you try not being an asshole for once, okay? Nellie could be dying here.\" Leilani seethed angrily, turning back to her patient. Hautangi grumbled quietly, rubbing the sore patch idly.\n\n\"Come on, she's gonna be fine. We all had some weird shit happen to us and we came out fine, right?\" Hautangi yawned, flopping down in the nearest available bed. As he recline, the con-man stretched out and smiled. \"Give her a few days \nand she'll be right as rain.\" Tired of the conversation, the big Maori promptly went to sleep. Standing in the middle of everything, Poindexter frowned. Though smart was never a word associated with the taxi-driver, a thought was forming\nin his small mind. \n\n'He's right. We've all gone through something like this. Is it all related?' His mental process was rudley interupted by the sound of his stomach growling. And like that, the grand ambitions of Benjamin Poindexter having a brain were \nthwarted by something as simple as hunger. The cab driver left to assuage his cravings while Leilani tended to the unconscious one of their number. Though it had been said almost as a jest, Hautangi's statement turned out to be prophetic:\nOnce a few days had passed, Nellie awoke from her coma. Dazed and confused, it took her some time to realize her new condition. Once she did, the results were...unpleasant. \n\n\"I'm an albino?!\" As someone with a healthy dose of narcissim, the revelation was not well received. \"Do you have any idea how much this ruins my life?\" Hautangi snorted loudly before speaking.\n\n\"What life? You're a wanted terrorist living in a barn and learning how to be a better criminal!\" Hilariously, this actually seemed too calm Nellie down. The event planner thought the concept over for a little longer before agreeing.\n\n\"I guess that's true. And this gives me a chance to practice my make-up skills. Silver lining.\" While she spoke, Poindexter and Leilani were staring at her in horror. It took a few moments for her to realize. \"What? Guys, what's wrong?\" \nIt was Poindexter who spoke up, his voice cracking. \n\n\"Your...your face. It's moving.\" Sure enough, Nellie's face was spasming uncontrollably. The woman in question began feeling her face, growing more and more worried about the facial shifting. Leilani leaned forward curiously as her \nabject horror wore off. Her words were filled with a detached interest, her medical background showing through. \n\n\"That's fascinating. It looks like your bones are flexible? Or is this just some kind of dermal shifting?\" Leilani began poking at Nellie's face, avoiding the recently awakened woman's attempts to swat her away. \"I wonder if you can\ncontrol it. It might me like exercising a muscle?\" Nellie growled angrily, bating the veterinarian away. Before she could speak, her facial features snapped back to normal. It was an odd sensation, having your bones and muscles \npop into a proper configuration. It was certainly enough to stop Nellie in her tracks, the words lost. Serendipidous timing as well, since Ghost chose that second to speak up from the barn door. \n\n\"Sorry kids. Am I interupting?\" The mercenary's tone was thick with amusement, even if his face remained as frustratingly blank as ever. It took but a moment for him to be seated at the table and barely another before the team sat arrayed around him. Ghost distributed the long awaited alcohol with the smallest trace of a smirk, waiting for the sound of relieved drinking before he spoke. \"So, ignoring whatever the fuck that was, I've got your next job.\" Ghost doffed his hat with a flourish, though his eyes were still concealed by dark glasses. \"Last job, as a matter of fact.\" Poindexter almost choked on his beer, foamy white froth spurting out of his mouth in surprise. Hautangi faired better only because he wasn't guzzling his down like a large animal dying of thirst. Leilani stared at Ghost with shock written across her face, though her keen mind soon identified that as left-overs from Benjamin's super-soaker impersonation. Nellie was the first to react, leaning forward eagerly.\n\n\"Are you serious? God damn you Ghost, this had better not be another one of your sick jokes!\" It was impressive how quickly Nellie managed to run through the emotional gamut: Hope, joy, regret, hesitation, anger, frustration. The last was definitely present in force as Ghost laughed openly, his frame heaving with mirth. \"You're an asshole!\" Nellie hissed through clenched teeth, hands clenched into little balls of pain. Their mentor waved her off as his hysterics subsided, trying to speak through the last stray chuckle. \n\n\"Woah there, Nellie.\" The former event planner's face exploded into livid colour at the phrase but Ghost cut her off before she could speak. \"I was being damn serious. You do this job, you're free. No more barn, no more Chrissie and no more wanted status.\" The four fledgling shadowrunners before him watched on with tentative optimism, waiting for him to continue. \"You'll never be able to go back to who you were before all of this but your time of living in a cage will be over.\" Ghost readjusted his glasses and leaned back on his bar stool. \"You'll just have to complete your most difficult, danger fraught mission so far and break into the high security data repository currently housing your DNA. If you fail, you'll either rot in prison or be killed on sight.\" The mercenary took a small swig of his beer, watching them impassively from behind his tinted shades. \"Any questions?\" \n\nTwo weeks passed in a blur of training, preparation and called in favours. Remember way back when in Part 6, the mission where the team had to blackmail the A.L.E. Information Technology Specialist? Well, Miss Mercer would be providing a very brief window of opportunity for the team. She would be sabotaging the digital security for this particular facility, ensuring that external communications were useless and rendering the on-site Spyder about as helpful as shoes for a Naga. Ghost would provide a physical distraction so that most of the physical security would be far too busy to deal with us. That left the team to infiltrate a near impenetrable A.L.E building crawling with all kinds of nasty surprises, locate the biological samples that A.L.E was trying to use in their astral pursuit and destroy them within the very small time available to them. Since the main entrance and any side doors would be rigorously patrolled by security forces, our intrepid runners would be required to take a more...unorthodox method to their infiltration.\n\n\"I fucking hate all of you.\" Hautangi griped quietly through his gas mask, his massive form trembling with effort. \"First I get accused of being a fucking terrorist, then I get kidnapped and stuffed in a fucking hole with you idiots.\" The large Maori inched painfully slowly up the tube, finding it nigh-impossible to maintain purchase against the slick walls. \"Then Ghost hauls us off to bum-fuck nowhere, locks us in a shitty barn and tells us that we're going to be career criminals.\" It was with a violent exhale that Hautangi cleared the first half of the pipe, fingers aching and muscles burning. \"We've blackmailed people, stolen shit, had a shoot-out with megacorp pricks and blown up a fucking power station.\" He paused for a ragged breath before continuing his agonizingly slow ascent.  \"Leilani melted, the Fat-Man has little fucking robots in his blood, Nellie turned into silly-putty and I fucking exploded.\" Hautangi forced himself higher and higher, trying not to retch as some of the scent leaked through the chemical mask. \"Now I'm climbing up a fucking shit pipe!?\" Surrounded by oozing faeces, Hautangi contemplated whether or not this whole thing was worth it. So in depth were his thoughts that he did not notice Leilani until a slimy hand slammed into his shit-covered backside.\n\n\"What the fuck are you stopping for? Quit whining before I shove my fist up your ass and really give you something to complain about!\" The former veterinarian snarled through her micro-transceiver, the short-range communications devices proving more difficult to track than standard comm-link chatter. Beneath her, Nellie cursed angrily at the hold-up and Poindexter did his best to keep up with everyone. Though the constant exercising had done a world of good for the alcoholic, he was still flabby enough that the rise would have been difficult even without the large duffel bag he carried. Ghost had been incredibly pleased with himself when he suggested their route. For lack of a better option, the team had reluctantly found the outlet for this facility's sewer system. The beach was actually quite scenic when the tide was low but the small beach flooded often. This made it perfect to leave an unguarded entrance to an otherwise secure building. Just getting to the grating had been difficult enough, the pipe situated above a series of wicked rocks. A quick climb and a few minutes with a mini-welder had granted them access but none of the crew were pleased about this. Even with the bulky hermetically sealed suits and the chemical protection masks, no-one was looking forward to what came next.\n\nThus, we find our intrepid runners slowly ascending a steep, filthy tunnel. Coated in yesterday's black bean burrito, the walls made it difficult to hold onto anything...and the group had been tricked into putting their weight onto mounds of slightly more solid matter more than once. In truth, it was amazing that anyone made it up the pipe let alone all of them. After what seemed like an eternity in the tenth, previously undiscovered layer of hell, Hautangi hit solid metal instead of concrete. With a sigh of relief, the con-man began feeling around for the edge of the metal cover. When he found it, Hautangi took a moment to steady himself against the passage walls before pushing. The manhole covering refused to budge at first but, with the constant force that was Hautangi, slowly slid open. It was for this reason, above all others, that he had be chosen to go first: No-one else could move the damn cover. \n\nAs soon as humanly possible, the team had hauled themselves out of the sewerage pipe. They emerged exactly where they had hoped, an old maintenance room that few workers entered. After giving themselves a quick breather, everyone quickly stripped out of their sludge covered suits. Poindexter opened the bag before doing so, doing his best to avoid coating their equipment in shit. Each of them wore the dark blue jump-suits of A.L.E maintenance workers, mercifully free of filth. Nellie cringed, knowing that they would need to get back into the suits for their inevitable return trip. For now, they all prepared for the next phase of their plan. Leilani handed everyone a pair of smart-glasses, along with their other accessories, before sending a data burst to Ghost. A few, tense seconds passed before a small countdown flickered into life across the dark lenses. It had started at 5.00 and was ticking down in an almost threatening manner.\n\n\"Alright. Let's move. Hautangi, you're up first. Any guards you meet, drop them. Poindexter and I will provide covering fire if you need it. Nellie, get to the repository and finish phase two.\" Leilani's no-nonsense tone might have once evoked a juvenile comment from Hautangi or a snide remark from Nellie but everyone simply nodded their agreement. \"Good. Get it done.\" Like a well-oiled machine, the team sprung into action. Hautangi opened the maintenance door with their copied key-cards and slipped out, followed by another member of the crew every five seconds. Nellie emerged to find Hautangi beating a guard while Leilani choked out a fleeing cleaner. She moved past them without even blinking, heading directly for the secure area beyond. Poindexter followed soon after, a small pistol held at the ready. The facility was shaken by a dull roar as explosives began to detonate outside, a pyrotechnic display that drew most of the guards from their posts. Nellie took it in stride, walking through the recently mopped hallways until she came to her prize. A single security agent stood in her path, having drawn the short-straw for his assignment. Moving to stop her, the man collapsed in a twitching pile of limbs as Poindexter snapped off a pair of taser rounds. \n\n\"Good shot.\" Nellie noted off-hand as she slid her key-card through the scanner. There was a loud whirring noise that almost drowned out the cacophony outside. The colossal vault door slowly came to life, hydraulics hissing as they strained to raise the impenetrable barrier. It's rise was not unlike the team's own: tedious but steady. Nellie barely waited for the smallest of cracks before slipping inside. The repository was a strange cross between the efficiency of a bank vault and the sterility of a hospital, white walls adorned with many small lock-boxes. Nellie smiled, already picking out the best place to plant their little gift. She was joined by Poindexter only after the door was opened fully, the larger man gingerly placing the duffel bag at her feet. Nellie began carefully removing the contents, setting them up around the room. It was at the moment that the final item was placed that something inexplicable happened: The countdown dropped from two minutes to zero. Everyone froze, unsure how to react. Nellie and Poindexter were looking at each other with panicked expressions, trying to figure out what to do, when a pair of gun-turrets dropped down from the ceiling.\n\n\"Holy shit!\" They knew how to react to that. The duo took off running as machine gun fire tore through the space each had previously occupied. They scrabbled through the entrance, narrowly avoiding an increase in their copper percentage. Here, another surprise awaited them: A trio of Doberman drones were being deployed from revolving wall panels. Horse-power equal to most sedans, state of the art tracking software and a pair of sub-machine guns wrapped in a bullet-proof chassis. Poindexter desperately dodged past the lethal automatons, adrenaline lending his struggling body the strength it needed. Nellie took the more direct approach, hurtling over one of the slowly activating death-dealers. They rounded the corner at speed, slamming directly into Hautangi and Leilani. As the group tried to remove themselves from the pile of limbs, Leilani growled at the frightened pair.\n\n\"What the fuck are you doing?! Did you even plant the package?\" It was impossible to interpret the babbling from Poindexter but Nellie gave a more coherent response. \n\n\"Fucking run!\" She promptly sprinted past the others, towards the maintenance room. Hautangi suffered whip-lash as he spun to watch her before turning back to Leilani. The question he was about to ask died on his lips when the three drones rounded the corner, guns blazing. Frightened shouting mingled in with the staccato of automatic weapons fire, the runners doing their best to catch up to Nellie. Cue a frantic scrabble for safety as each of them slid across the aforementioned wet floor. It took precious moments to right themselves but Fate was on their side this time: The drones had not been rigged for slippery conditions and spun out of control. It would only take a few seconds for the Dobermen to resume the hunt, but those seconds may have saved their lives. Out of character, the GM had rolled a critical glitch on their shooting roles and responded appropriately. It was a much appreciated stroke of luck for the players.\n\nThe trio found Nellie trying to wriggle back into her suit. Making a snap decision, Hautangi grabbed his gas mask before diving down the tunnel. Hearing the whirring of approaching drones, the others followed suit. Each of them snatched their filthy gas masks from the floor and leapt after him. As it turns out, the tube was sufficiently lubricated to act as a horrific slip-n-slide. The group went hurtling down the steep passage way, trying to keep the chemical protection filters pressed against their face. Difficult at the best of times, Nellie found it even more challenging while trying to prime the detonator with one hand. Thankfully, she was skilled at multi-tasking. The shaped charges placed around the repository exploded, destroying the samples inside without causing any harm to the staff. This was only a minor comfort to the team as the tunnel quickly came to an end. \n\nHautangi hurtled free of the pipe, soaring through the air like an inexplicably talented sack of potatoes. His landing was as spectacular as his flight, water splashing through the air as a large Maori crashed through the surface. Barely conscious, Hautangi feebly tried to drag himself to what little shore remained as the others appeared. Nellie was much lighter than her friend, thus she flew further. Instead of hitting near the beach, the disguise expert disappeared into the crashing tide. Poindexter was the least lucky as the pipe discharged him directly into the craggy rocks beneath. Leilani was the most fortunate of the team, forcing herself to a stop just before the mouth. Frantically climbing out of the pipe, she hauled the broken form of her friend down from the rocks. By the time they reached the beach, Hautangi had somehow managed to retrieve Nellie. No words passed between them as the team made the painful hike back to their hidden vehicle. Benjamin slowly drove everyone back to the barn as Leilani administered what aid she could under the current conditions. Everyone but Leilani was beaten, bruised and bloody. Worse, they all smelled like fetid shit. Still, there was an air of triumph to accompany the horrid smell.\n\nThat sense of victory was dashed when Poindexter stopped outside the farm property. The team stared wordlessly at the crumpled form,  wearing a long coat and hat, lying before the open barn doors. A silent conversation happened between the team, ending in agreement. The van pulled away quietly and headed back towards the main road. There was still one last part of the plan to finish. It took them several hours to arrive at the small medical clinic but Doctor Samantha Hirsch (Part Four) was waiting for them. Checking them over, the professional nodded and put them under the knife. Soon, each of them had new faces and new identities to go along with them. The teams were provided with a high quality fake SIN and a cred-stick bearing five thousand nuyen. There was only one stipulation: No more team. After everything they had been through, it was time to go their separate ways. I could lie and say that there was some kind of tearful group hug or declaration of respect but the break-up was a silent thing. Poindexter trundled off in the van while the others slipped away into the shadows.\n\nAnd like that, it was over. No more A.L.E breathing down their necks, no more isolated barn and no more team. In the span of one night, they had gained their freedom and lost everything else. By this point, each of them was simply too numb to care about anything. The future was an uncertain thing but they were better prepared than they had ever been in their lives. Whatever came next, they would handle it the way Ghost had taught them too: As shadowrunners.\n\nThat, ladies and gentlemen of Gametales, is the end of this story.

        "text": "It's taken a while to get to our next game, but here's an update. As a note, this campaign is winded in it's investigation, as it's primarily perpetrated by my character's decisions.\n\nOur Jade magistrate group has finally set out to Shiro Yamamoto. Our Asako loremaster was still a bit winded and stayed behind at the Ebitsu Temple, regaining her composure and continuing the pursuit through the temple records. On the journey was the Mantis courtier, the blind Ikoma Marito, the quiet Mirumoto Bushi, and Bayushi Kazo, the Scorpion bushi.\n\nAs we make our way to the Shiro, the path is a fairly pleasant road up the mountain. Approaching the Shiro at about noon, I stand outside the wall, the sky begins to take a darker tone, overcast with clouds. I hail to the game, announcing myself (Bayushi Kazo), the members of my entourage, and my purpose. I waited for a few minutes, without hearing an answer to my call. The walls are empty. The Mirumoto decides to open the door. I stand in full view, still waiting to be received. As the opening spreads, the courtyard is empty. There are no samurai, no servants, no ashigaru. As I make my way to the main door of the primary building, fail begins to fall. I knock on the sliding door and again announce myself, still to fall on deaf ears. I open the door, and inside I meet the first person in the Shiro, a little samurai girl, dressed in a nice kimono with finery. She welcomes us inside, as guests, and says that court is in session past the next set of doors in the grand hall.\n\nHalf inconsiderately, I remark as to why I wasn't welcomed before, where are the guards, and why hasn't anyone mentioned about the court before. She fails to answer, but it's no matter, it's a child, I wasn't expecting an answer anyways. I ask for a room to place my Daisho. I still expect to resolve things peacefully. The girl shows me to a side room, which has several sets of Daisho already placed. I take note of the mons that adorne some of the swords. Almost one from each Great clan, and a five or so others not directly apparent. I set my Daisho with my No-dachi and my katana, keeping my wakazashi. The Ikoma has an ancestral katana, and questions if she should set it down aswell. I inform her that, she can keep her sword, but as the presumed champion for our group, that I would then keep mine as well. She sets it aside. The others keep with waks, and the Mirumoto Bushi keeps his daisho.  We then enter the main hall. Inside there is a small court going on. Most are gathered around a table, with food plenty. At the head of the table is an elder man in Crane colors, presumably the Daimyo Yamamoto Ansho. I announce myself again (Samurai vocals are well exercised).  \n\nYamamoto Ansho gleefully announces that he's glad to have more guests. This is a court of bounty, prosperity, and pleasure. I thank him for the welcome and offer my gift of the Umbrella. He refuses, as is proper. I insist that I would be glad for him to have this gift, this is a personally hand crafted umbrella, that I made within the walls of the Jade Palace, of fine materials commemorating my journey. He refuses again, I continue to insist, and the gift is then received. The others around are given a chance to announce themselves and present the gifts, chosen in earnest.  At the table, the daimyo recommences with a story. A story about a large fish that refused to be caught. The Daimyo is lord of the land, and through great effort catches the fish, and instructs it with it's spot within the great Celestial wheel... the lord's stomach.   Everyone gathered around musters a laugh. I inquire as to the well being of the ones that I was sent to find, the Imperial Herald, Miya Rie, and the Daidojo Assessor. The Daimyo says that they have been enjoying their stay, and they can be found right to the side of him. I then move over to talk to the herald, while the Mantis starts to ask of more stories from the Daimyo who gleefully begins on another story about a mountain bear he fought. (The audience to the daimyo can be seen, deftly rolling their eyes about another embellished story).\n\nThe Imperial Herald acts as if she can be barely bothered to speak with me. I inquire about her well being. The Herald says that she's fine and wants to stay, but is weary of how long the court has been going on. I inquire as to how long, and it seems that she's been in court for a few months, ever since she arrived. I ask about the report she was supposed to give. The herald, lays a veiled insult as to why a jade magistrate is inquiring, it must be because they exist unnecessarily.  After enduring some insults, I decide to move on with my investigation. The Herald seems fine, but overall lacks where-with-all to assess the court that she's been with for months.\n\nAround the table, I maneuver to a Bayushi Tajiro. I ask him about the court. He tells me he originally came here around the founding of the family, like the other great clan representatives, to make a deal for resources, as the land always seems to be plentiful. He's a small military leader, but has been in the court for a long time. While talking with him, I talk about my bushi sensei, and inquire on whom he was taught by. He mentions a shosuro bushi, a name I can vaguely recall had long since passed. I ask about what's interesting things have happened in the court. He mentions that the Daimyo can have a very aggressive disposition whenever he is bested, and that is one of the reasons that they no longer play the game of Go. In particular he mentions a Lion Ikoma, who is very proficient at Go, also refuses to play the game since he refuses to be lenient against his opponents. The court always tries to please the Daimyo, and it's usually best for everyone that the daimyo wins.\n\nThis now sparks a potential interest... although, I'm not good at Go, it'd be interesting to know what happens should the daimyo lose. I move over to talk to the Ikoma, this time taking the party Ikoma (Marito) with me. Talking with the Ikoma, we gather again, that he's been here for a very long time and that the last Go tournament was reason to not play again. A ronin, Kagemori had challenged for a game, and later went on to win the tournament. Kagemori was met with a torrent of anger, but he still remains in the court. I choose to then meet with Kagemori.\n\nSpeaking with Kagemori, begins to develop some more important information. Kagemori was previously mentioned as having visited the Ebitsu temple about 10 years ago, looking to join the Yamamoto family. I ask about his visit at the temple, he recalls such, and says he's been in court since arriving. He mentions some period of time that is way off from what it should be, I note that the temple record has his visit as from 10 years ago. He seems to passively acknowledge that it probably wasn't that long, but he doesn't really recall how long it has been.  I mention some of the large events that has transpired within the past 10 years, again to test if he can comprehend the passage of time. Primarily, the passing of the Last Hantei emperor, but he doesn't know anything. Fairly certain that any court would have been aware of this event, it just furthers that this place is a kind of limbo.  I resolve to see if I'm caught in such a time gap.\n\nI excuse myself and move to the side doors of the hall. I ask with some of the other guests about the castle, and the other rooms. The guests appear to never leave this room. I make my way to the front. After I grab my Daisho, I move into the room with the last door. The little girl seems to appear next to me, but I might just have missed her approach. \"Are you not satisfied with how things are going?\" \"No.\" She also inquires on what could be done to make me enjoy my stay. \"I have been here for a few hours, and I need to stretch my legs.\" She insists that it's still just the afternoon and I should stay, and again inquires on what could make my stay more enjoyable. \"If there was an event outside, possibly something more entertaining with dueling\" She says that I should go back into the hall and ask the Daimyo. There aren't any windows, and I tell her that I'm going to step outside and motion for the door. The little girl says, I shouldn't do that. The Daimyo can hold an event out the back door if I want. I declare, \"I came through this door, and I shall leave through it too.\"  While reaching for the door, the corners of the room darken to a black shadow, and dark veins streak to the door. The entrance disappears and shadows start to encroach more aggressively in to the room. The little girl shouts to stop, with a frightened look and runs down a side hallway disappearing. I move away from the door, backing up. As I make it to the hallway, the shadows recede. \n\nMoving back, I decide to get one of my shugenja to help assess the situation. The sightless Marito is right where I left her, and as I get her, the Asako Loremaster arrives. I meet with the two at the hallway to the Court.  I catch the loremaster up to date, and tell them both about what happened when I approached the door.  The Loremaster, always trustful of the Scorpion leader, storms toward the front. I choose to experience this vicariously and stand in the hall facing the door. The events goes on nearly the same, but this time I can hear whispers in a language I don't know from a place I know not where. The loremaster appears to be listening to the walls and the center door, but backs away as the darkness encloses. The loremaster chooses to run after the girl down a side hallway. As I'm leading the blind Marito, I tell her I'll be behind her and start following. As we round a corner, we move onto a covered walkway, but the Asako lost track of the girl. From the covered walkway, we can see it's still raining but now it's evening.  Choosing to not attempt to leave the path yet, I follow the walkway to a building adjacent to the main hall. Inside the building, is a lounge type room, and next to that is the kitchen for the Castle. Inspecting the kitchen, there is no one present, no preparation set up, and no food in any pantry despite there clearly being fresh food within the Court. We exit the opposite door, again to a covered walkway, this one forks into 2 directions. On the South end is a dojo size building, and to the north is a 3 story tower like building. Next to the \"dojo\" building is a well. It's still raining. I ask the shugenja if she the spirits seem different in this place. She can't tell for sure, but wishes to move over to the well, where she can commune with the water kami and touch sense with the stone well.  We move out into the rain toward the well.  The rain is cold and strangely not wet. As Marito touches the well, we all begin to notice the oddity of the rain. She tells us that no one has touched the well since it was built, and starts to commune with the water kami. The odd rain, isn't actually rain. The droplets hit, and then seem to scurry off. After looking closely the droplets look like tiny spiders! landing and pinching before scurrying off and flowing across the cobble stone courtyard. With hurried attempt at composure, I move back to the covered walkway, with the Asako, as Marito finishes asking the water Kami a question. Looking back to make sure that Marito is following, a dark figure is walking amongst the rain, seemingly to blink in, and out in a jagged pattern in the direction of the well.  As we get onto the walkway, the figure seems to vaguely go in the direction still of the well, but not turning toward us. While keeping an eye on the figure, I talk with Marito. The spider rain is a phenomenon, not of a different realm, but rather caused by a disjunction with ningen-do with a seperate realm. An unnatural phenomena being an unconditional attribute of whatever is warping this place. Marito varifies this by detailing her commune with the water Kami. The first question was what caused the weather, to which the Kami, still in ningen-do , show clear blue skies. The second question, was if they have noticed anything strange. The water kami's second vision to marito is of a lion spirit with the face of a man, a spirit developed from a long manifested connection to ningen-do.",

Aragagon the Paladin  dies, as does our Druids wolf companion. It was a difficult fight to say the least. Any way we get back to found haven't found jack shit as far as evidence goes. Around 7 ish game time a messenger comes to inform us that a Lynch mob has formed outside the court house at this point the only players are myself and our fighter. We try to intimidate and diplomacy roll our way our to no avail. Crowd busts in we set the beast free, he kills a bunch of people. Shit hits the fan. Come to find out (out of character) that Aragagon the Paladin  helped increase the size of that mob and had he lived would have been leading it. And the best part is that since our characters don't know we can't actually do anything about it. I have never been so angered and impressed by a character as I am with Aragagon.  I hope you rot in hell you magnificent jackass.",

        "text": "Before I start: I'm a relatively new DM, and that will be clear in the story I'm about to tell.  I didn't do everything perfectly and am not happy with how it resolved; but, that's why I'm posting.\n\nThis story properly begins with some times I *did* give the PCs (really, one in particular) plot armor.  When the cleric (*cough* with 8 con *cough*) charged recklessly into an assassin vine level 4-5, I had the vine stop constricting him once he was unconscious. \n\nWhen they were a few levels higher, they encountered a dragon they weren't meant to attack - well, another reckless charge later(*cough* and a second after a breath-weapon warning from said dragon *cough*), he straight up died, but in the story there was a high level cleric nearby so he got a free rez from that once they met up.\n\nWhich brings us to today. \n\nLast session, they discovered that a clan of barbarians (Clan A) had been attacked by a horde of zombies that used to be another clan of barbarians (Clan B).  They went to Clan B's hometown, and found it to be filled with corpses and mostly destroyed.  After investigating the town a while, they noticed the woods surrounding the town were filling up with zombies, skeletons, and Morghs.\n\nI dropped hints that help was on the way (they saw a swarm of large flying creatures coming their way, these particular clans are known for riding Wyverns and their ultimate goal was meeting up with \"Clan Wyvern\"), but alas, after last session seemed to end with the plan of \"defend this guard tower while we look for a good time to escape\", this session the plan changed to \"everyone run away as fast as you can through the hole made by a single fireball last session\".\n\nWell, unfortunately, the party consists at this point of:  \n* a monk (movement speed 50/200 running)  \n* a cleric (movement speed 30/120 running in light armor)  \n* a druid (movement speed 20/60 running in medium armor)  \n* a sorcerer (fly, 60ft)  \n\nSo, the monk takes off running. He could easily run forever. The cleric takes off after the monk, also running.\n\nDruid and sorc cast longstrider and fly respectively, meaning they only get their movement speed.\n\nNow here's the problem.  I established at the beginning that the treeline was 240 feet from the start.  I also established that the zombies started at the treeline.  I mentioned before that the hole was created by a fireball.  Take all of this together, and you have the cleric stopping his second movement at the treeline, no more than 20 feet from zombies in both directions, even after I hinted that he'd be right at the treeline if he ran again.  \n\nSo, after 2 rounds, the monk was 400 feet from start, the cleric gets surrounded by zombies 240 feet from the start, and the druid/sorc are around 120 feet from the start.\n\nAnd then the cleric rolled under 12 damage on his channel energy.",

I rolled up a wacky retinue of companion characters to join her, and crafted a simple \"fetch the holocron / whoops the Sith Empire wants it too\" plot to start things off.  And so it begins:\n\n**A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away….**\n\n&gt; Alaya’ta and her master, a Jedi Knight named Kalaani Tem, have traveled to Rishi on a secret mission for Jedi Council  After spending days combing through seedy cantinas all over the Bootlegger’s Market, they finally have tracked down the merchant who’s selling the item they are searching for.\n\nThey were just about to head to the meeting when Kalaani is notified by the port authority that your ship has been impounded!  She needs to go sort this out immediately, so she sends her apprentice has to make the meeting with the seller!\n\nMy daughter immediately took to drawing the cantina, making sure there was a stage for the band. Had a funny little conversation with the vendor, a jawa named Gleek, via his security droid H1-24. \n\n&gt; *“Salutation: Greetings, meatbag.  I am H1-24.  My master, Gleek, wishes to convey welcome in whatever ridiculous manner is appropriate to your species.\nInterjection: I should point out at this juncture that my primary function is security and defense, not protocol.*\n\n&gt; *Resignation: My master’s determination to use me in this capacity is almost as tenacious as my inability to have my core programming subverted to it.*\n\n&gt; *Assertion: I remain optimistic, however, that these negotiations will swiftly break down and I may resume my primary function of exterminating hostile targets.”*\n\nMy daughter cracked up at \"meatbag\", and I knew we had a winner.  The negotiations went fairly smoothly, and the trio head to Gleek's shop to collect the item.\n\nShe took in the atmosphere of the tropical pirate haven on her way from the meet to Gleek's shop to pick up the artifact, but as they arrived another of Gleek's associates --the Mon Calamari, \"Sarge\"-- ran out of the shop chasing a Sith trooper! He chopped down the trooper with his staff, and shouted to Gleek, \"They have the case!\"\n\n&gt; *Exaltation: Finally! Some meatbags to eradicate!*\n\nThree more Sith troopers and a Sith student pop out of the shop, and the fight is on. We learned pretty quickly that crits really hurt, and that Force points are very handy (both Gleek and Sarge ended up on the mat by the end of the battle). It takes a while, but we eventually whittle down the enemy forces, and reclaim the prize.\n\nVictorious, Alaya'ta and H1-24 drag their fallen friends into Gleek's shop to patch them up. When Sarge comes to, he gets to shout, in true Mon Cal style, \"It's a trap!\" and points to the bomb that was shoved under a nearby table.\n\nThe four dash from the shop just seconds before it explodes, and are now heading towards the spaceport to meet up with Kalaani.\n\nNot bad for a first session!",

        "text": "Those who have been new to 5th ed Shadowrun at one point may be aware of 'Fast Food Fight', a short pre-made run in the Quickstart Rules. For those who are going to get into the game as players rather than GMs, I can only offer a brief warning of spoilers to come, though the basic setup doesn't offer a glorious amount of intrigue or plot focus.\n\nSo, what is Shadowrun, Fast Food Fight, and who are the collection of freshly made professional criminals being hired to perform this run?\n\nShadowrun is a game set in the near future where magic had returned to the world, but also technology has significantly improved. Big businesses have become their own nations in a way, and things have gotten interesting and possibly grimdark, though not to the extent of things in the 41st millenium.\n\nShadowrunners, for whom the game is based around, are individuals who hire themselves out as deniable and expendable assets, to perform tasks for folks that would largely be considered illegal, gritty, suicidal or all three rolled into one.\n\nFast Food Fight is a short module for new Shadowrunners to get their feet wet with one simple task on a very small scale.\n\nThe premise is that an elf had been coerced by the local mafia into paying a protection racket, and upon failing to keep up with a payment down the line, is punished by them as they kidnap his daughter as collateral. He hires the runners to find out where she is, get her back, and if possible pin it on someone that will have the mobsters leave the poor guy alone.\n\nOur team:\n\nAn **Elf Street Sammy**. Corporate Owned (specifically by Parasol, who I think are owned by Ares, Horizon or Aztechnology. I could be entirely wrong, though) and cybered up to the nines. Seriously, I think the guy has 0.43 essence remaining before he becomes a Cyber Zombie. Put his highest priority as resources to afford all the cybertech and weapons.\n\nA **Human PhysAd** who carries around a Katana, but mainly for the better damage stat. Has a cousin who is usually the Johnson for a yet to be defined corp or higher power, and has been wanting to break into Shadowrunning for years, additionally has a cat mentor spirit.\n\nA **Human Face** who carries a loud as fuck Ares Predator V, with Smartlink. Also has a series of social cyber upgrades such as pheromones and the like, as well as a mask with vision enhancements for combat purposes. Has all the dice for social stuff, and I mean ALL the dice.\n\nAt this point in time, it was a session for us to learn how the system worked for future runs, so things like Backstory or even Codenames hadn't been officially decided yet. Those would come later.\n\nThe run starts off with the PhysAd using their sweet stealth skills trailing Vic Fratelli, one of the higher ups in the local mob, while he wanders the streets before entering a McHughs (which is like McDonalds, but significantly worse, if that were remotely possible.) The Johnson (who would normally be anonymous for this, but identified themselves as George Hampton) mentioned that Vic would likely know where they're keeping his daughter, and they should pump him for information.\n\nReporting back to the others, the Street Sammy enters the building while the Face locates a back door.\n\nWith the Street Sammy being at least 70% metallic, the MAD Scanner around the door goes nuts, causing not only the security guard (a stocky man in garish red and yellow armour), the kitchen staff (one dude in a matching red and yellow uniform) the janitor and possibly the manager file out to greet him with guns raised. One guy at the back of the restaurant, the nicely dressed Vic, also stands and aims his pistol at the Sammy, politely telling him to slot off and perhaps read the 'no weapons' sign out front. The other patrons (a couple, a twitchy human and an Orc who seemed too tired for this shit) watch on in concerned fascination.\n\nThe Sammy turns to regard the security officer, who was the closest to him, and tries to con the guy into thinking the safety was still on. Thankfully, the man hired to protect this place and all within wasn't particularly sharp, and as he looks to check his firearm, the Sammy crosses the ten feet of distance, dismantles the gun and brings the guy into an Armlock, finding out quite quickly that the dude's right arm at least was mechanical.\n\nWith human shield in tow, the Sammy brought him over to the self-serve order kiosk, ordered some food and paid in full. In one of the most tense burger joint transactions this side of Redmond, the Sammy picked up his food and carefully backed out into the street, pushing the security guard back into the building.\n\nThankfully, not much else came of that, as no lives were lost and money was made, though there was a very loud argument coming from inside. The Sammy sat on a bench across the road and ate his  food, regretting it sometime later. Keeping an eye on the door, he watched as the other patrons filed out one by one, leaving only Vic and the staff. WIth the information garnered from the previous exchange, the group deduced the whole building was probably a Fratelli operation, and that Vic would be receiving backup from the others inside. Using his thermographic enhancements on his eyes, the Sammy identifies at least two more people in the building that he didn't see previously.\n\nA brief plan is conjured, and the Face and PhysAd head to the backdoor while the Sammy stays out the front. Priming a pair of smoke grenades, the puts them in the paper bag from his food, and hurls it through the front door. As the MAD scanners go off, the inside of the building is swiftly consumed in thick smoke.\n\nWith the distraction made, the Sammy runs in and gets into a fist-fight with the security guard. Meanwhile, the PhysAd bursts in through the back door (which was by the kitchen for this run) and with one swipe, separates the goon in the kitchen from his legs. The Face peeks around the corner and nails the manager in the shoulder before ducking back behind cover. The Runners held the advantage here, having goggles or eyes, at least, that could see through the smoke. The Security guard (nicknamed 'Lucy') takes a swing at the Sammy but misses by a mile, the kitchen staffer (Nicknamed Patsy) was bleeding out and screaming constantly, the Janitor (Dipsy) takes a shot where he thought the Face was, but Critically Glitches and almost takes out Lucy, Vic hits the wall trying the same thing and the manager (Frank) tries casting a Force 2 Armour spell on himself, but Critically glitches and almost casts Agony on himself instead.\n\nThe Sammy breaks out his Monofilament Whip, using it to severe Lucy's robot arm at the elbow. The PhysAd rolls over a table to cut down Frank, and the Face finishes him off. Dipsy, Vic and Lucy shoot, shoot and swing wildly and miss their targets once more.\n\nDeciding to switch to the more important target that is Vic, the Sammy attempts to use the whip to disarm the mobster, which was a little more literal than he had hoped for, with Vic losing his gun and both his hands, crumbling to the floor and getting a less than desirable amount of his own blood on his nice suit.\n\nThe Face then proceeds to put a bullet in the brain of Lucy, leaving only Dipsy the Janitor standing against a team of highly trained professionals. Logically, he decides to pull a [Trout](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2qr83m/are_you_ready_for_some_shadowrun_storytime/) and surrenders with the promise of many spilled beans.\n\n Ultimately, the group found the hostage locked in the walk-in freezer with another goon, who she already disabled by dropping 20kg of Meat Substitute on when he was distracted. It was a good day, returning the girl and convincing Dipsy the hit was performed by the Ciarnelli Family.\n\nThey were paid a grand total of 2000 nuyen, and earned a further 14000 by fencing the cyberdeck Patsy apparently had on him (turns out there were a pair of turrets in the ceiling that he could have used, but was cut down before he got the chance.)\n\nHopefully if I can get creative in my runs, I might tell the stories of how this group of runners continued to do what they did best. Their next objective is to acquire a cargo chopper to do up with weapons and armour, a prospect that is merely a stopping point before trying to acquire the 2 mill nuyen zeppelin they seem rather entertained by. Should be an interesting game.",

        "text": "It has been some time since I posted a story to this venerated subreddit, due to a combination of two factors: I am busy as fuck, and I have not had a tabletop session truly worth writing about in some time. But today, The Fantastic Bumblecunts, my new group of players formed after the end of my campaign with [The Glorious Chucklefucks](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3jesji/the_glorious_chucklefucks_updated_a_complete/), discovered that they had not, in fact, been playing [The NoiRPG](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3v72pj/introducing_the_fantastic_bumblecunts_in_the/). They had actually been playing Call of Cthulhu.\n\nSee, up to this point, the Bumblecunts had been investigating murders n' shit in 1920s New York. All on the up-and-up, no magic or fantasy elements at all. But I threw in subtle clues from the beginning about a larger, sinister conflict behind it all: their first case dealt with a murdered book salesman, who had recently purchased a rare tome \"written by some mad Arab,\" which had been stolen after his murder. A gibbering madman had remarked that a fleeing suspect had been \"chased by an Outer God.\" And gangsters within the ruling crime family had hinted, vaguely, at a far greater threat to their city. To my great satisfaction, these hints went completely unnoticed at the time; I was careful to slip them subtly into the narrative, spread out and vague enough so as not to draw attention. I had planned for this hinting and alluding to go on for months more before the big reveal, but as everyone who has read my Tales must know, nothing in my games ever go according to my plans.\n\nThis session, during the course of a fairly normal murder investigation, the player characters were invited to a \"Policemen's Ball,\" hosted by the Don of the crime family ruling New York. Given that my players hated this guy with a passion, assuming that he was the campaign's Big Bad, I had planned for them to refuse this blatant bribery and corruption. I came up with scenarios and shit, combat encounters, I had in my mind a whole new direction for the campaign. But the fuckers decided to go.\n\nWell, shit.\n\nFortunately, I had not considered it to be impossible that they would choose to attend the dinner, and had written a contingency for it. The event was snazzy as hell, a luxurious dinner in a lavish ballroom for which the Don had spared no expense. The PCs, along with the rest of the police department, dined on exquisite delicacies paid for with bills soaked in blood, drugs, and bootlegged booze. At the end of the evening, every guest received a small envelope, a \"gift for your meritorious service.\" A blatantly illegal bribe, which no self-respecting officer of the law would accept. As the PCs watched, every one of their colleagues took their envelope and walked out into the night, not one pair of eyes willing to meet another. Preparing to leave themselves, the PCs were pulled aside to speak to the Don himself, Michael Armani, a man whose description I based on that of [Gentleman Johnny Marcone](http://erebus-odora.deviantart.com/art/Gentleman-Johnny-556397762), a character in the Dresden Files, my favorite series of books. He smiled a tiger's smile and told the PCs that he respected them for their talent and integrity, and that he wanted to make them an offer. There was a threat, he told them, to the city of New York which was far worse than him. A menace which he could not defeat directly. He offered the PCs a chance to work with him to combat this threat, and to save New York. \n\nMuch to my surprise, the Fantastic Bumblecunts accepted.\n\nWell shit. That feel when you're so persuasive that you convince your players to fuck up your own plot.\n\nSo, with this uneasy alliance having been formed, Don Armani spilled the beans. Given, however, the people who may end up reading this tale, I cannot reveal which particular beans he spilled. Make of that statement what you will. However, I couldn't justify him not revealing the fact that there was a Cthulhu cult running around with magic n' shit, thus bringing to light that the game the Fantastic Bumblecunts were playing was not what they had been led to believe, that they were unwittingly participating in a game of Call of Cthulhu. The reaction among the players wasn't earth-shattering, but there was genuine surprise, and a little bit of outrage, in the room. It got much more of a reaction than a [previous reveal of mine](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2zun42/dd_5e_when_a_surprise_character_betrayal_failed/), and I was overall very pleased with the reveal. From this point onward, the campaign will change significantly, and I am expecting fun times and hijinks to abound.",

        "text": "The following is a recap of several sessions of a game of Pathfinder I played with a single player. The setting is homebrew but I still use the same pantheon as Golarion, although with a different mythology. I also created a new non-player race known as the Terions, whose origins we shall soon discover.  But now that we got that out of the way, let's get to the story.\nOur story begins with the arrival of our hero, the Human Rogue Remo Dark, to a small mountain town called Underreef. As he would soon find out, it was given this unfitting name because the town was built over an underground lake rich with resources, once dug by a one-eyed figure. Soon after arrival he met one of the locals, a gloved man named Jae who he, being a large fantasy fan, asked the typical question of the location of the nearest tavern. Jae pointed out to our hero \"The Poisoned Claw,\" a small rustic building resting in between a magic shop and a general goods store a few blocks ahead. As quickly as he said this he left, disappearing down an alleyway. Our hero, curious as the felis catus, looked in the alley, only to find it empty. One perception check later and he had found a hatch built into the ground which seemed to be locked tight, along with an insignia imprinted in the side. The insignia in question? A gloved hand holding a purse within it. Our hero did the brave thing and...decided to continue on his way to the tavern, and not reporting it to the authorities. \n\nAs he entered the small building, soft music and chatter greeted him. Looking around granted him a view of several dwarves drinking and looking over several papers, as well as a cloaked figure sitting in the corner. Finding himself parched he strode over to the bartender, who greeted him and offered him some ale and room, for a price. Agreeing to this, Remo went on to show the man The Macgu.. No wait, sorry, The Amulet, an artifact left to him by his archaeologist grandfather who gave it to him after returning from one of his expeditions, until he disappeared the very same night. The amulet, marked with strange sigils on its edges and center as well as strange indentations on the back. The Bartender, who had spent his life working hard and pouring ale, until he earned enough money to open the Claw and make a good life for himself, had only seen real magic once before, and he pointed our hero to the source, also known as the Miracle Worker, AKA the hooded figure in the corner. he told him of how this figure arrived in town recently and had begun to do strange magical favors for those in need, such as giving the bartender to improve the beer, or how he seemed to have enchanted the pickaxes of the group of dwarves sitting nearby, making them dig twice as fast.Sitting himself down next to him, he then began to speak to him about the amulet and how he hoped to find out the secret behind it, and the figure replied in its strange otherworldly voice, its eyes glowing blue behind the hood, of how he would first require a favor from an adventurer such as him before he would grant him a miracle. Being the adventuring spirit he is, he agrees. Now the true adventure began! By adventure I mean the character getting by the skin of his teeth, and at times succeeding in incredible ways.\n\nThe Miracle worker began to tell our ambitious rogue of how he he had come to lose a magical artifact of his, a black horned skull, to a tribe of orcs residing in the mountains. Our hero, ready to serve began to concoct a plan, using the most famous concoction of all, Beer! After going over to the bartender and asking for the price of a barrel of their strongest beer, Goblin Tears, which the bartender told him cost 500 gold, which our hero considered way too much and after attempting to vaguely threaten him with the idea that the Miracle Worker would place a curse upon should he not lower the price, the bartender simply laughed in his face and told him that the cloaked figure clearly only did good things, and not once in his time had harmed a soul, and only performed helpful magic for the people of Undereef. Going back on this decision, Remo instead asked him for the cheapest beer, which was Bitterwater, a cheap swill that was made as a placebo to serve to drunks when they ran out of coin by the end of the night. Along with this he purchased an empty barrel of Goblin Tears, which due to the popularity of the drink, could be found in extensive amounts in the back room. So, carrying this barrel, which he filled with the Bitterwater, he decides to go to the Local Apothecary and buy a batch of sleeping powder. One magic shop/pharmacy mix-up by the GM later, he now has a barrel of Bitterwater marked as being one of the most expensive/high-quality beers in the region, and a batch of sleeping powder. this can only end well for the orcs.\n\nAs our hero returns to the tavern, the sun now setting and the moonlight shining through the lanterns, he sees a commotion within the tavern as the dwarves seem to be packing maps and tools into their bags as quickly as they can with worried looks on their faces. Being worried/seeing a quest opportunity Remo questions them on what's going on and they reply that an explosion has been heard from the town treasury, to which the dwarves had been digging an extension to, and it needed to be repaired before any thieves could get to the stockpile, and of course to have them capture any bandits currently in the act of robbing the treasury with the promise of a reward. Feeling helpful/wanting some of that reward, Remo offered to help and the dwarves were only more than happy to accept it. And so, the dwarves led the Rogue to a small shack, where it was revealed that there was actually a small elevator shaft within, and with a pull of a lever, a small platform rose up to meet them. As the dwarven miners got on, Remo looked, around, shrugged and stepped on, realizing he had noting to really lose. The Dwarven Leader gestured towards the lever, and Remo Dark, Human Rogue, pulled down on the mechanism and descended into the dark depths of Underreef, totally ready to score some money and stab some bandits. \n\nTo be continued in Part 2, which I will gladly write should enough people wish to see it. Hope you enjoyed! \n",

        "text": "Let me preface this with saying I am NOT trying to TPK my players. I just wanted to throw something crazy at them and see how they’d fare and what they’d do. I half expected them to retreat a few times to come up with a new strategy.\n\nSo I'm GMing a game of Werewolf: The Apocalypse 20th anniversary edition. It's set in the Viking ages, and I just decided to add a very old, very powerful Tzimisce Vampire to the mix. This vampire controls a town, and has an arrangement with The Wyrm. Well in their first encounter with him, the pack leader, Holger, decided to start shifting to Crinos form as the Vampire was talking but he decides to roll instead of spend rage.. Gets 2 successes so he starts to shift pretty slowly. In that span of time, he uses his power to rip off Holger's arm and shift the shape into a spear that he hurls at the person he sees next, named Asher. Asher rolls 0 successes to dodge, and takes 9 lethal damage to the gut, so he's incapacitated. At this point, another in the pack, DarkDance, spends rage to shift to Crinos form, tackles Holger and holds him, and gets everyone to calm down as the final member, Khepri, in lupus form, just sits there and watches.\n\nThe Vampire agrees to let them go. He doesn't want to have to leave this place, as Tzimisce's power ties them to home), and if he kills them, then two tribes (Fianna and Get of Fenris) are going to be knocking at his door. He tells them not to come back and pulls the spear from asher and reforms it into an arm shape and shoves it back into Holger’s arm socket so new muscle and flesh can grow more easily. So after Asher recovers, he uses his ability to talk to animals in to get some birds to deliver word of what happened to Tribal elders. They convene because the issue could be big, and this isn’t the time for tribal in-fighting, and they bring large warbands in. Some surveillance also suggests there are Nosferatu being housed under the largest structure in town, the inn. The pack is given the task of killing the Nosferatu before the main fight ensues, as the Tzimisce may be using them basically as blood bags. They do this by releasing the terrified wretches from the basement, tricking them into thinking they are letting them free, which scares the inn patrons out of the inn. Then they step out of the inn, and lo and behold, the sun is out. The Nosferatu turn  to Holger, now in Crinos form, saying he lied to them. Holger passes the strength check to strong-arm them into the sun, sending them screaming in pain.\nHere comes the good part. The vampire steps out to greet the warbands, and without even raising a hand, every building in the village starts to fall apart. And take the form of ghoulish bone constructs. The entire town was built out of bone crafted to look like wood. I thought I’d be clever by giving the ghouls (again constructs, not actual ghouls) spikes all over so that a Garou can’t easily attack one with claws or teeth.\n\n\nBut motherfucking Holger. That glorious son of a bitch. He’s like “I’m going to push the ghouls together.”\nMe: “…. What?”\nHolger: “Yeah I’m gonna start sticking them together.”\nMe: “Okay then. To what end?”\nHolger: “I’m going to make a ball and start rolling a bunch up.”\nWhole party: “Like a fucking Katamari ball!” (OOC of course)\n\nI just start fucking laughing my ass off. I don’t like to restrict players when they come up with something that thwarts something I come up with because it’s always entertaining. So I have him roll. He passes. He gets a ball about half his Crinos height going. Then he says he’s gonna roll it up the hill toward the main fight (they were still at the inn, and even the inn had started morphing.) I had him roll again. 8 successes. Fucking 8. So he starts rolling this ball up the hill when Asher’s like “WAIT! I’m gonna search to see if any of the booze in the bar of the inn is unbroken.” So I have him roll. 4 successes, so 4 bottles of alcohol. They dump 2 bottles on the ball and make Molotov-esque throwables from the other two. And Asher lights them with his flint. They throw the molotovs and this now-huge fucking Katamari ball of bone, sinew, and organs is on fire. And then they just push it down the hill. Everyone looks over. Even the Vampire is like “What the fuck” and everyone is just stunned. It goes wooshing through a BUNCH of ghouls and rolls off. \nHolger shouts “I’m gonna do it again!” and runs back down the hill, but the Vampire of course runs after him, and since it was late as fuck already, we closed there for the night.\nAnd that is the flaming Katamari ball of awful.\n\nIf someone could PLEASE draw this, with a stupidly happy looking werewolf pushing a ball of bone and ghoul that’s on fire down a hill, please fucking do. I want it to hang from my GM room proudly.\n\nEnd note, if this Vampire seems overpowered, it’s because he is. He’s a Methuselah age vampire that has mastered Vicissitude. But then again there are warbands assisting the party at the moment. \n",

        "text": "It was a simple request, from an old friend. He didn't want to play the villain. A few lackeys, the major henchmen, but not the BBEG. And I was the only other DM. So we began. \n\nKerg was dumb, slow moving, and not actually all that strong, but people couldn't help but love him. Honestly, he was one of the worst Fighters ever, but his enthusiasm was high. I had been talking about giving myself a challenge, and told the other players I'd rolled 3d6 straight down after choosing my class. They bought it. Even then, they didn't see my real stats, as I'd fudge up or down a couple.\n\nI kept notes as always, passed notes to the DM as always, and most were Monty Python and Princess Bride references as always. This time, though, it was also a code. The only one I really remember was the one I used most: \"You seem a decent fellow\" meant \"I'm rolling to miss.\" He'd come up with the cover system:if I was going for a miss, he'd subtract my roll from 21 to get the result. \n\nWe made it through a few sessions before it came up, then we entered the Caves of Silence. It was a maze, but had next to no combat. And someone said to split up. I fought hard not to laugh maniacally. It was worse when they paired me with our halfling bard. We headed of down the winding rocky corridors, and I pondered how to kill her, knowing that I had to make sure the player wouldn't even catch on. She cannot keep a secret, and was not ready to be outed. After all, I had just gotten one of my lackeys made mayor,  and with the party's help no less. My plans were just starting. \n\nThen the DM helped me out with a \"near-dead end.\" There was a canyon splitting our path, and while I had equipment to get us safely across, she didn't know it. It's really easy to hide a bag of holding inside heavy plate armor. She had rope, but no way to get it stuck on the far side. I went to suggest an idea when she beat me to it. \n\n\"I tie the rope around my waist. You're going to throw me.\" I was so glad I had pre-written the note; she never even noticed me pass it.\n\nI pretend to try and talk her out of it,asked the DM if I had the strength for it, but she was determined. So I rolled the dice. 2. She rolled a reflex save to catch a wall, and got a 1, breaking her hands and preventing another try. I rolled strength to keep hold of the rope. 18, blast! She rolled for Use Rope. Another 2, so her knot slipped when the rope was taut. Splat! \n\nAh, some peace and quiet. She left to go make a new character, while I let the DM know how Kerg carefully used a few immovable rods and the rope to safely cross.\n\nI considered feeling guilty, but then I left so the other pair could have their turn with the DM, and as we swapped, the Sorcerer said, \"So I hear we're not going to the Superbowl any time soon.\"\n\nI chuckled, then went to help our newly ex-bard make her new victim, er, character. \n",

        "text": "So, recently as a DM I've been pushing my players to put more thought into their characters, what motivates them, what put them on the adventuring path, why they tolerate or enjoy each other's company, where they come from, just trying to hone in on what makes them a person and show that during gameplay. So when I got a chance to play again, I figured I'd hold myself to the same standard and wrote this up shortly after the character was introduced, asking the DM to fudge it so that a friendly researcher happened upon a sort of obituary of him (the character was brought back by his god to help turn the tide in a big doomsday type battle for dominion of the world between some stronger deity's, usual campaign stuff). Enjoy!\n\n\n\n\n\nMitchell Broadford was born in Ridgeview, a moderately sized town past the outskirts of the royal city of Kessington. He was one of many born the November after the Winter War, a surprisingly hale and rowdy bunch even in their earliest years. He, like his peers, was raised with a burning passion to earn renown in service to the Fire of Dawn, their bold young king whom their fathers had served, securing his eastern borders. \n\n\n\nBy 9 years of age, he and six of his comrades had distinguished themselves enough to earn the attention of a once master-at-arms stopping in town for a fresh horse before reuniting with several other veterans of rank. Watching the boys spar in the streets, he saw potential that couldn't be ignored, and with a few words to the right ears, they were soon at home in the city barracks, training in lance and sword and spear and shield through the day, while codes of conduct, tactics, and the history of the kingdom, its allies, and enemies, and their many, many Royal and noble family trees were memorized through the evening and night.\n\n\n\nThey were to be knights, great leaders in the Shining Shields, a keystone of the king's military strength that had never once forfeited ground to an enemy. But Mitchell took for friend a young priest, as talented in a study as Mitchell was in the field, and he taught the soldier all everything he would hear of the realms and powers of the divine. Through his friend Mitchell found his faith in Pholtus, the God of the Silver Sun who prided in law and light, a fitting patron for a servant of the Sun King. When Mitchell swore his oaths to the crown, he swore them to Pholtus as well, and Pholtus blessed him. A rebellion in the south led the Shining Shields to Mitchell's first battle, and divine power manifested in him as he struggled to the aid of a fallen brother.\n\n\n\nReport of his ability to heal wounds and bring the wrath of a god to bear against his enemies reached the king, and Mitchell was promoted to the royal guard, the youngest and least experienced knight to ever earn the honor. Belittled as a greenhorn, Mitchell took the pledges of the guard to heart regardless: constant vigilance, unyielding strength, selfless sacrifice in the cause of protecting ones charges. When the time came to declare his sigil, in a good natured nod to the mockery of his elders he named himself Evergreen. A solitary pine with gold crown about its trunk on a silver field was placed on his shield, and so began his service in the Order of the Rose, his place in the Shining Shields forgotten. \n\n\n\n...\n\n\n\nWhere most royalty is content in their own halls, the Sun King was wont to journey, long and often, and for this Mitchell was grateful. Every road has its perils, and every peril gave him purpose, and a chance to prove his worth. Mitchell performed many great deeds across the realm, and soon became his majesty's close friend and most esteemed companion. Where the two were first inseparable by standing order, there was now a strong bond the king insisted was \"true brotherhood\". \n\n\nFor 13 years Mitchell served loyally, displaying unfaltering valor and a famous zeal in all of his actions. Regrettably, he was laid low in his 32nd year, in what would prove to be the first of many assassination attempts in the Great Siege War, in which our neighbors at every border conspired against us. His majesty reports that Mitchell, upon the first shots of the ambush, charged to his side, taking a poisoned spear through his sword arm meant for the king's throat. Dismounted, he aided in a push through the ambush that allowed the king's retreat, intercepting several assailants and dispatching them with his shield before the poison finally robbed him of his ability to stand. From a knee, he removed the spear from his arm, wielding it to great effect until the caravan rallied and laid waste to his attackers. \n\n\n He was buried in the Hall of Saints the following week, and by the king's decree the traditional robes were ignored so that the warrior might lay at piece in his truest form, armored, sword at his side and shield before him. In his honor, a mighty pine tree 30 ft wide at its base was transplanted into the royal gardens at great expense. It now serves as a sundial, the hour of his passing marked by a small mosaic of his sigil.\n",

        "text": "This is a game I run. I have a co-GM who does this little write up and helps me with plot. I hope you enjoy.\n\nSo here are the notes from last game. A couple of quick notes on the ... uh notes. Ed, I do not know your characters name, you may have posted it but when writing this I could not find it, so you are the mystery man or man with no name for this one. Also I still am planning on turning this into a story, but will have to keep the notes themselves shorter as this last game was going to turn out to be like three chapters, and not short James Patterson like chapters. So when that is all done, and I figure out where to post it, I will set up a link. Meanwhile, in the words of my granddaddy, sit back and enjoy the fucking show cause its free smart ass.\n\n\nDec. 31st 4 A.C.\n\n\nThe new group arrive at the four winds bar. As the group enters the bar one by one, they approach the bar tender. Each one orders a grasshopper and gets a letter informing them about a ship coming in at the docks at ten am in the morning the next day. Desdinova, the bar tender, sells three to three group members, and gives one to a nasty tempered half orc named Doc Chop. Desdinova mutters something about half orcs having small dicks as he turns back to the bar. As they await the boat coming in, the entire bar celebrates the coming of the new year, and party til the wee hours of the morning. There are lots of drinks going down, plus a few drunken maidens. A bar room blitz breaks out as a man in the back says every body attack, and a good time is had by all.\n\n\nJan. 1st 5 A.C.\n\n\nThe next morning the group wake and head for the docks to wait on the boat. The hours fade away and yet there appears to be no sign of the boat. The group head back to the bar and decide to wait another day.\n\n\nJan. 2nd A.C.\n\n\nAnother day with no boat. Doc Chop continues to make money by pulling teeth, some of his customers want them pulled, while others just except their fate. The other members of the group just enjoy the steady flowing of booze and broads, while one member of the group hooks up with a cross dressing halfling.\n\n\nJan. 3rd 5 A.C.\n\n\nYet another day without the ship, and the group is running low on money, except for Doc Chop who is making a few bucks with his private practice of tooth removal services. When they return to the bar to ask Desdinova if has heard anything about the boat, he tells them that he is just a messenger, and knows nothing. \n\nHe does tell them that if they are in need of money, there is a woman in need of assistance. They decide to go and check out the job. When they arrive they meet a guard who appears to be a bit new and overwhelmed by his job. After alot of talking and failed intimidation, the group make it past the guard make it to the house where the woman lives. They get served by a maid, before a very attractive young woman comes in and introduces herself as Susie Davenport. \n\nShe goes on to tell the group about her parents passing away. She continues and tells them that there was more debt then she had realized, some of it was for storage for her family's boat, The Golden Horse. She says that she paid Mr. Vark, one of the men who helps the harbor master out, but they refuse to release the boat, saying that it was never paid off. \n\nShe believes there is more money in her family vault, but needs a ring off the boat to get into the vault. She offers the group 200 gold a piece for the job. The group agree to do the job and head to the harbor. When they arrive they see that the boat is in the middle of the harbor and appears to be guarded by a number of armed men. They go and talk to the harbor master, who seems like he is too old and mentally unable to run a scam. \n\nHe tells the group that they need to speak with Mr. Vark. When they leave in search of Mr. Vark they are unable to find him. So they come up with a plan and rent a large row boat to go out to the Golden Horse. As they make their way they see two sail boats that appear to dock near the Golden Horse. One of the members of the group yells in pain as he gets a splinter in his hand from rowing. There appears to be an exchange between members of the guards, one of the members of the group overs hears the words, \"Animals\", \"Below Deck\", and \"Hurry\". The battle starts as one of the guards swings in an attempt to hit Dinvun, the oracle, and misses. With a great sigh the guard becomes exhausted. \n\nThree members of the guard frantically head below deck. Dinvun over hears people below saying, \"Fuck it, burn it all down\" yet can not tell anyone as he dose not speak anything other then celestial when he is in the heat of battle. Oppenheimer tosses a bomb at one of the guards killing him. Hyperion kills a guard as well. Dinvun kills more guards. The members of the group that are actually on the boat begin to smell smoke. Doc Chop carves his initials into one of the guards and kills him( with a scythe). One of the guards fires a crossbow bolt at Doc Chop before running and jumping off the boat and screaming \"Holy shit\". \n\nThe party hears a loud roar from down below in the belly of the boat, as well as the screams of a few men. Uriel makes his way up the side of the boat, and then to the captains quarters. One of the group recognizes Varks voice from below as he screams \"Ahhhh get off me!\" Oppenheimer and Hyperion head downstairs to take care of the fire. The smell of smoke and animal shit fills the air. Dinvun heads downstairs as well, bringing up the rear. Doc Chop runs across the deck to the men that are attempting to climb up to the boat andcuts the ropes, bringing the men crashing down to their boats below. \n\nBillows of smoke rise from below, a man runs up covered in claws marks, he falls down into a pool of his own blood. Uriel disables the lock of the captains quarters and begins the search for the ring they were sent to look for. Uriel notices that it appears as if someone had been living in the captains quarters. One of the group plays back up for Doc Chop, in case anyone try's to come back up to the boat. Those below deck hear the sound of a man trying to scream, but it sounds like his screams are being drowned out. Do to the thick smoke they can not see beyond five feet in front of them, yet Hyperion seems to be able to make out a few cages with animals still locked inside. He does his best to navigate the lower deck, looking down he notices a trail of blood leading off into the wall for smoke. As the group gets closer, they can make out the silhoute of a large animal and what looks like a limp body clutched within its jaws. \n\nOppenheimer looks to the floor, and as he gets closer, he can see what looks like the white paws of a large cat. The group gets closer and sees the bloodied and torn body of a member of the crew, his head in the jaws of a white tiger. A tooth sticking from the just under the jaw and protruding out of the mans mouth. Hyperion notices that it appears as if the animals are beginning to die from smoke inhalation. A man staggers out from the smoke, and the tiger takes a swipe at him. Uriel rummages through the cabin and, continues his search for the ring. He finds a secret compartment within a desk that contains a sack of 25 gold. Uriel stick the sack in his pocket and continues his search. \n\nA member of the group goes to aid Uriel in his search. He casts a spell to detect magic, but does not find anything. Meanwhile the tiger bites the staggered man and killing him, and starting to eat him. Oppenheimer finds his way to the fire, after using the walls of the ship to navigate his way, he narrowly avoids the tiger, getting just a scratch from the mighty creature. He starts working on putting the flames out. Dinvun makes his way towards the fire as well, helping Oppenheimer put out the fire. Doc Chop throws a water barrel on the men in the boat below, who are trying to get away from the burning ship as fast as possible. Uriel comes across some papers, in which is a list of the animals contained below. He yells out to the group below, \"I think the asshole has the ring on him!\" \n\nThe fire below is finally out, and Dinvun speaks in celestial, no one can understand him, but its tone appears to be dickish. Uriel feels around and finds a spot on the bed that had a secret compartment, and he finds the ring. \"Found it! The asshole didn't have it!\" He yells out to anyone that can hear him. Below the members of the group try to figure a way to get the tiger back into its cage. As the tiger finishes its meal, Dinvun goes and chops off the leg of one of the dead men below, and tries to entice the tiger. As it bites, sinking its teeth into the dead flesh. Dinvun can feel the tigers whiskers tickle his arm. \n\nDoc Chop opens the cargo hatch letting the smoke tapped below, billow out into the air. Uriel decides to raid the captains cabin in case the boat sinks. One of the group color sprays the tiger, which does nothing to the tiger but annoys it. Hyperion tries to move the tiger into the cage, doing not much but pissing the tiger off causing it to swipe at Hyperion, who can feel the breeze of the paw pass and smell the sick sweet smell of fresh blood. Dinvun tries to shove the tiger back into its cage as well, moving it slightly to the cage. Oppenheimer searches the bodies of the dead guards and the remains of Mr. Vark. \n\nHe finds the keys to the cages, as well as some money and a few weapons. In a collective manner, the members of the group below finally get the tiger back into the cage, locking it. Dinvun mends the ship, while Doc Chop shows the men in the boats escaping, a large half orc ass. Many who see it will more then likely have nightmares. Uriel shoots an arrow with a note that tells those guards who ran away that they have Vark alive, and would be willing to release him for a large amount of gold. The guards do not appear to be dumb enough to fall for the trick, as they toss the note and decide that it is now beer o' clock, and head out. Uriel finds a note that says \"Chimera looks to sunrise, Cyclops looks to sunset, Medusa looks to sunrise, Umber Hulk looks to sunset, Basilisk looks to sunrise.\" \n\nHe tucks it into his pocket as they untie the rowboat up and clumsily try to sail the boat to the docks, they smacking it into other ships before finally crashing into the docks. The guards at the harbor bring in a Captain of the guard. They try to explain to the guy that Vark was smuggling animals, and was killed. They take him down below and he investigates the \"crime scene\". It appears to be more then this guy can handle and he goes to get his superiors and Susie Davenport. A crowd of guards block the area from on lookers. A paladin cop shows up and investigates the scene. He separates the group to interrogate them. He sets up shop in the captains cabin, and begins his interrogation with Hyperion, who tells the cop his interpretation of the story. Hyperion gets dismissed and told to leave the ship. \n\nThe Paladin cop seems to be getting different stories as to who the leader is, but gets the same story as to what happened on the ship. Uriel finishes up his interview with the Paladin cop and hands him the sack of gold he found in the captains cabin for Susie. The cop tells the group that they are free to go, and thanks them all for their cooperation. The group tells the cop that they are going to the bar and if Susie shows up to go ahead and meet them there. She does indeed show up at the Four Winds bar, and thanks the group for their help. \n\nShe offers the group another job, to escort her to the temple where her gold is being held. They agree to help and decide not to rest and just to go ahead to the bank. At the bank they meet a clerk, who they learn is infact the bartender from the bar. He sees the ring and escorts them through a maze of tunnels, finally coming to the vault that contains Susie's family's money. Desdinova tells them that if they need any further assistance, to just call his name. They come across a combo lock and figure that the note that Uriel found on the ship has something to do with it. Uriel works the on the combination and after a time, figures it out, unlocking the vault. The vault appears to be pretty damn big, and the group takes it carefully as they look for traps. While searching, one of the traps gets set off, spring a large mechanical snake from the ceiling. The snake bites at Uriel who steps out of the way, setting up for another member of the group to do a telepathic bitch slap to it. Doc Chop does a power attack with his scythe, sticking the creature like thing. However, this leaves him open for the snake to bite him. Dinvun runs up on the snake with a slashing attack, putting a nice slash into the mechanical monster. \n\nOppenheimer throws a bomb at the snake, narrowly missing the rest of the party. The snake bites at Doc Chop but misses. The battle is combo of bombs, slashes, and bites up until the end when when the group wins. The rooms of the vault appear to be messy, like it was looted. As they leave Susie asks Desdinova about somebody else coming to the vault. He tells her about a gentlemen the looked like her a bit and had a ring like hers but a different color. She says it must be her brother who she thought might have been dead but is glad to know he is alive. They talk to dezi about the boat, but he does not know, and sends them to the docks to find info on the boats, because that is where one should find info on a boat. As they say their good byes to Susie, they mention how they were happy to help her out and turned out it was better that they decided NOT to rape her after all. Uriel goes to talk to the harbor master, and gets little info, meanwhile member of the group throws a fit because sailors will not talk to him or be nice to him. Dinvun finds out that a boat came in about an hour ago that is headed for Hawaii. But it is leaving first thing in the morning, so the group decide to rest then try and get passage on the boat.\n\n\nJanuary 4th 5 A.C.\n\n\nThe next day Dinvun approaches somebody at the boat and asks about passage, the crewman says he will go and get the captain. After a bit of time has passed he returns with the captain, a tiefling by the name of Leroy. Leroy tells Dinvun that passage will cost 50 gold a piece, and that he is heading to San Francisco with a brief stop in Hawaii. Dinvun tells him that he will inform the other members of his party about that and be back for the ship casts off. Dinvun returns to the bar and tells his fellow settlers about his conversation with the captain. The party agrees to the terms and heads back to the ship. The cheaper members of the group try to negotiate a discount in exchange for services. A few members of the crew are quickly disappointed that those services are not of a sexual nature.\n\n\nJanuary 8th 5 A.C.\n\n\nAfter three days at sea and not much going on, Uriel, who has taken up residence in the crows nest, notices weird little creatures climbing up the side of the boat. He quickly rings the alarm to bring notice to the crew. Uriel recognizes the creature as goblin sharks, half goblin half shark, not to be confused with a the deep sea dwelling shark of the same name. Oppenheimer tosses a bomb off the side of the ship with a chuckle of glee, it hits its target and one of the goblin sharks catches fire, falling to the blue below. Uriel shoots a couple arrows and hitting one, piercing its forearm and left hand. The yet unnamed mystery man of the party, aims his weapon and awaits a target. Doc Chop swings his scythe, the goblin shark ducking, but manages to collide with the creature when he brings his blade back. The goblin shark turns its head, avoiding a decapitating slash, only to get as deep cut across its left eye. One of the goblin sharks climbs over, and takes a swing at Doc Chop, missing and getting knocked off balance. The mystery man fires of a shot off, but fails to hit the creature. Uriel calls out \"Two more in the rear.\" One of the ships crewman misunderstands and unzips his fly looking for some open ocean ass. The goblin shark attacks Doc Chop with a little nibble on the arm. The other goblin sharks jump at the fallen half orc, and begin to bit and claw at the monstrous figure. Even when down, Doc Chop's eyes fill with fire and deep centered need to kill, is orc blood runs hot as he fights the goblin sharks with what little strength remain in his body. Hyperion goes to the defense of his fallen comrade, as he attacks one of the goblin harks, slashing and hacking to protect the half orc the lay bleeding out on the ground. Oppenheimer quickly pulls a potion out and guzzles the whole thing, then he swiftly moves in for an attack. Uriel fires off another but again fails to hit anything other then wood. The mystery man moves in and casts a spell to enlarge Hyperion, who grows to a much larger size. The goblin sharks attack Hyperion, one of them bite his armor and loosing as tooth. Hyperion manages to make it to the fallen half orc and stabilizes his wounds, preventing him from dying. Hyperion stands over his fallen comrade and swings wildly to prevent any other goblin sharks from attacking. Finally the sailors step in and help the group, fight off the goblin sharks, Oppenheimer tosses another off the side of the ship, a knocking one of the goblin sharks off the boat. Uriel severs a muscle in the arm of one of the creatures with a well placed arrow. Dinvun raises he blade, and swiftly brings it down, beheading one of the goblins sharks. Blood shoots from the falling body like a fountain, raining blood from the heavens onto the Dinvuns cloak.. The final goblin shark makes his stand, he snips and bites at any of the sailors that try and make a move at him. Oppenheimer shoots a crossbow bolt hitting the creature in the thigh, bringing it to one knee. Uriel fires off a shot, piercing its arm through the elbow. The creature is looking bad. Hyperion moves over lands the final killing blow, the creature closes its eyes as is accepts its fate with an almost sad look of relief. Dinvun attends to the wounded, casting healing spells on the fallen sailors and Doc Chop.",

        "text": "A few sessions back we were all waiting for the rest of our players to get to session. So, our DM decided to give us a side quest. The players there were myself Roland the Ranger, Davros the Fighter, and Hilaria the druid and her wolf. So basically we're sent to find out what happened to some farmers kid. My Ranger finds a trail leading off to the forrest so we all follow it. After about 20ish minutes of tracking we come across a den looking area and are attacked by a very pissed 800lb bear. Davros steps up as he is the party tank backed up by the wolf. This is where shit hits the fan. Aragagon swings and misses so badly the Bear turns on him and lands a solid blow knocking him down to damn near half health. Then the Bear manages to grapple him and proceeds to try and bite his face off. At this point I'm pumping the Bear full of arrows and the wolf is trying unsuccessfully to pull it off poor Davros who it has failed literally every check to break the grapple with a 10 or lower. After a few rounds of this Davros manages to break the grapple by one point and immediately withdraws as he's down to single digits in HP. At this point I'm thinking: \"great. Our party tank is basically useless and I'm stuck here with nothing but my long bow, a wolf who's not looking to hot, and a druid who dosent have any spells left. AWESOME.\" AT&amp;T this point Hilaria calls her wolf back and approaches the Bear with her newly purchased scythe drawn. I'm thinking she's about to die as is the DM. As we all watch she rolls a natural 20. \"Roll to confirm\" orders the DM. So she does and rolls another goddamn nat 20 and drops the bear. At this point Roland is both terrified and impressed by this thing wispy  little elf girl standing over a 800lb bear that she's just quite literally gutted like a fish. So after I skin the Bear she asks me is she can keep the claws. Sure I say. So we get back and she orders 2 spiked collars made from the claws for her in her group. Meanwhile Davros is bloody and hanging his head in shame. \n\nTLDR: wispy little Druid chick saves big burly Fighter from a big mean bear.",

        "text": "We have been playing a campaign in the Magic: The Gathering setting of Innistrad. We are playing a campaign heavily involved with the Church of Avacyn, and we are (or were) 6th level. I play as a dwarven alchemist, and we have a human sorcerer, human wizard, human paladin, and human cavalier. The land is at the mercy of evil forces, including the dreaded Garolf the Stitcher, werewolves, vampires, demons, and all manner of foul beasts.\n\nAfter defeating a lich in Havengul and returning to the capital of the faith, Thraben, we were tasked with making contact with the far northern town of Winterhaven, which the church hadn't heard word from in months.\nAfter a long and arduous journey, we reached the town. Right off the bat things don't seem right in this town. They are afflicted by almost supernatural blizzards, people are going mad and disappearing from town, people go missing constantly traveling to the nearby mine, and some wizard named Valthruns is doing wizard stuff.\n\nWe decided that Valthruns was the most suspicious, so we decided to examine his abandoned tower. Unfortunately, the tower had no doors and the windows were the size of arrow slits. So our wizard flies up and scouts all of the floors: finds crystals, a magical snow globe, equipment for alchemical experiments, and a substance called Residuum. According to our GM, Residuum is basically physically manifested magic, and as a result is very valuable (and as it also turns out, unbeknownst to us, flammable).\n\nNot being able to distinguish magic on the walls of the tower from the equipment inside, we decided to blow a hole in the wall. Just to be safe, we decided to use all ten of my alchemists bombs. We decided to talk to the mayor about this, and he thinks the wizard is kind of a dick so he really doesn't care. We made sure to tell him to cover his ears...boy was that the understatement of the century. Our wizard thinks this is a fucking stupid idea, so he flies off to the ramparts on the other side of town. The rest of us decide to hide behind a building to avoid flying debris.\n\nSo, we set the bombs on a long fuse, and wait. The bombs go off, and instantaneously deal 168 damage (30d6+50). We soon discovered that condensed, pure, physical magic is highly volatile.\n\nI don't know how many dice he rolled, but the calculations went on for several minutes. At the end, the four of us hiding were dealt 300+ damage and instantaneously vaporized. The wizard was laughing his ass off, until humongous pieces of rubble came flying towards him from across town. The DM decided to be generous, and gave him two reflex saves, both of which he failed. He was pummeled by debris and then crushed by a building. The town, on the other hand, was absolutely demolished. Block upon block of buildings were completely leveled. Trees were blown horizontal. The parts of town not engulfed by the massive fireball were leveled by the shockwave.\n\nThe tone of the group was a mixture of extreme depression, disgust, incredulity, and laughter to the point of suffocation. Mistakes were made, and we all learned a valuable lesson about not committing acts of terror and massacring entire populations of people in the name of a Lawful Good deity.\n\ntl;dr We fucked up",

        "text": "The following post was not written by myself - full credit goes to u/ShadowPhynix. You can access the original post, and read all the comments and replies here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/4cdmmc/wtf_is_going_on_the_answer/\n\n____\n\nSo I've been seeing a bunch of wtf is going on posts from travelers or people not fully aware of the war going on in Eve, and I got a few messages to post my writeup on the reddit rather than as a comment. So, without further ado:\n\nThe political structure of Eve before the war was CFC, a super-coalition of 40,000 members+ having total dominance in the north of the map, in an area called null sec (or 0.0 space, it's lawless and can be player owned). The hallmark of CFC is enormous numbers of people in generally cheap doctrines (doctrine being a set of ships and tactics) to outnumber an enemy. They were considered to be totally unassailable, possessing manpower and resources far beyond even the most powerful of entities in Eve.\n\nLow Sec (0.1 - 0.4 space) is another area of space, and has some laws (not many though). The LowSec entities (known collectively as LSV) are constantly fighting over \"moons\" (a way of passively generating income for a player group), and their hallmark is obscenely expensive and skill intensive doctrines, to make up for comparatively very small numbers of players.\n\nCFC, the big group up north, have been stagnating because no one wants to fight them (they're known for making fights not fun, by intentionally lagging servers, avoiding fights and when they do fight, bringing so many people they can't possibly lose). To counter-act this, they declared war on LSV to take their moons (the passive income thingys) and force them to fight.\n\nThis didn't work. Instead of steamrolling the LSV groups with minimal preparation and effort, they got crushed in pretty much every engagement. By this I mean they'd lose full fleets and kill only one or two ships in return. Gradually they got a little better, but they almost never did \"well,\" almost always losing, and continued to be demolished by fleets that at times were a quarter their size or less.\n\nTo counter-act this, they prepared better and got more numbers. In response, the LSV entities put aside their constant squabbling and war mongering to band together into what is affectionately known as \"Forming Voltron.\" (thus the name, Low Sec Voltron – LSV). LowSec Alliances might constantly fight and war with their rivals, but they all hate one thing above all others, and that’s outsiders. The same thing happened again, with CFC losing fights, but on a much larger scale with fights involving thousands of pilots.\n\nAfter not only defending all their own moons, the LowSec entities proceeded to wipe CFC out of LowSec, taking all their valuable moons in the process. While this was happening, one of the larger Alliances in the CFC (who are a coalition of alliances) pissed of a group called I Want Isk (IWI), and enormously rich and powerful gambling organisation. Something about theft and betrayal, but regardless, they decided to pay these low sec groups to get revenge against the CFC for them (and is likely a major catalyst in them forming together so quickly).\n\nHaving successfully expelled CFC from Low Sec, LSV looked for future targets, and with likely direction from the IWI (gambler guys) and Tishu's BLOPs (battleships with a very long range jump drive to attack farming ships) campaign in Fade, set their sights on the north. With the assistance of virtually every major entity in Eve, who answered the call to arms from either being paid by IWI or the glory of the next major war, the new Coalition (who have yet to decide on an official name, although Money Badger Coalition (MBC) seems to be a front-runner) have begun an invasion.\n\nSpread across numerous regions and hundreds of systems, MBC have begun to systematically drive out CFC from their homes. Currently most of the alliance sin the CFC are in full retreat, after having lost several regions that were previously thought to be impregnable. As it currently stands, a large portion of the CFC have been ordered to withdraw to the far north, the home of Goonswarm, the leaders and core of the CFC. A recent address by the leader of goonswarm indicates they intend to use the north as a base to harass the allies as they grind the regions in order to control them totally. As the allies begin to grind out the regions which are increasingly being left undefended, the last few pockets of resistance such as the Co2 Alliance are gradually being worn down.\n\nIt is assumed that at some point the allies will move further north, once their latest conquests are secure, to take the fight to Goons. If this happens, you can be almost certain that we will see another battle such as that of B-R5RB several years ago (you can look that up, CFC won that one), which resulted in hundreds of thousands of dollars’ worth of assets being lost.\n\nIn other words, it’s the war of a century in Eve, with pretty much the entirety of the PvP groups in the game all allied against a single super-coalition. Regardless of who wins, it's going to be a really cool time to be in the game.\n\n**Update 1:**\n\nAs of a few hours ago, the allies / money badgers / whatever won a major strategic victory, successfully taking control of Co2's (a member of the cfc) primary staging system. This is significant because it was defended by the full CFC, lacking only their capital fleet due to their suspicions of a trap (which was actually them reading more into Co2 evaccing than anything).\n\nThis was the first major test, and the timer was won whilst inflicting enormous losses from the CFC's subcapital forces, with several fleets being wiped out to a man.\n\nImportantly, M-O is traditionally the bottleneck for accessing the space of the Northern Empires of the past, as it allows access for the allies into the northern regions (where the core of CFC live).\n\nFollowing the victory, Co2 have declared they will no longer support goons, and it is assumed they will now be supporting the Allies in the hopes of having their space returned to them.\n\n**Update 2:**\n\nSo the leader of the CFC, The Mittani, released their version of events from the M-O fight in a soundcloud recording which you can find [HERE.](https://soundcloud.com/user-611751041/imperium-fireside-3-29)\n\nThe gist of it is they felt it was at least a partial victory for them, as they were falsely lead to believe that the whole point of the iHub fight was to trap and kill their super capital fleet (neither side fielded their extensive super capital fleets in this conflict). Note the iHub is a structure which grants control of the system (ownership if you will) and allows upgrades of the system, and thus is essential to controlling the system. Edit for clarity: The iHub doesnt give specific control, but is one of many structures that does this in differing ways. Taking the iHub in this situation however gave the Allies enormous leverage over Co2, and takes away all upgrades previously in the system.\n\nSupercap fleets contain the most powerful ships in Eve, Titans and Super Carriers, neither of which can be docked and must generally always be piloted (thus tying up that pilot whilst the individual owns the ship), resulting in added cost on top of their already enormous build costs (for titans, this number is in the thousands of dollars range).\n\nIt is worth noting that the iHub timer is considered important because it allows the Allies to control M-O, which is an important stepping stone to the northern regions, where the CFC has retreated to. Whether they remain ignorant of the system's importance, or merely do not consider it to be important is unclear.\n\nThus you have the two sides of the conflict spinning this massive fight two different ways, with both claiming victory of different objectives.\n\n**~TL;DR~**\n\nThe largest coalition in the game decided to take a poke at the numerically inferior Low Sec alliances. Instead of crumbling as expected to the superpower, they banded together and pushed them back out of their area of space, taking all of the big coalition's income in the area as they did.\n\nOnce people saw it was possible to beat this super-coalition, most of the player groups in the game decided to band together, with encouragement from the enormously rich I Want Isk (IWI) gambling organisation who have grievances with the super-coalitions's component alliances.\n\nToday marked a major victory in taking the strategically important staging system of one of the super-coalition's player groups which caused that group to flip sides to the attackers.\n\n**~Very TL;DR~**\n\nBig War.\n\nBig group attack little group.\n\nLittle group win.\n\nLittle group attack big group.\n\nEveryone attack big group now.\n\nBig group losing. Badly.\n\n**Original post:** https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/4c5r7q/what_the_hell_is_going_on/d1ff5om\n\n**Edit:** For clarity, CFC = The Imperium, they rebranded to Imperium to increase cross-platform marketability (so to other games).\n\n**Edit 2:** Holy hell, my first gold is for an Eve post, thank you kind stranger!!!!\n",

        "text": "The group gets together for my first ever role-playing session, and I am quite excited. We start out on a ship, and wake up in separate rooms to skeletons on board the ship. I fail a perception check, and thus don't wake up until the skeleton opens the door. DM rolls a natural 20, and my ranger has been knocked unconscious before even taking an action in a Pathfinder game.    \n\nThe fighter and monk down the hall take down the skeletons in their room, and find a one-armed skeleton standing next to a man who is bleeding out. Skeleton is taken down, monk revives me with a healer's kit, and we're on our way.    \n\nGet to the deck, and there's a small horde of skeletons, as well as a larger undead baddie commanding them. The party proceeds to charge out to take the ship back, and Denethor the Ranger gets his redemption by firing an arrow directly at the commander.    \n\nRoll.\n\nNat 20.\n\nCommander's head goes flying off, party quickly cleans up the rest of the ship, and we celebrate in our victory.    \n\nDM announces that a giant being arises from the ocean near the ship. The last thing that the party sees before falling unconscious is some tentacles and the being's glowing red eyes.    \n\nDM tells us that we are now in a dream vision, and seem to be inside some sort of tower. He then sets a Jenga tower on the table, and says that for every action we take, we must move a Jenga piece. If a player fails to do so, then they succumb to the dream, and lose a sanity point.\n\nGame on.\n\nWe proceed through the tower (which progressively becomes more misshapen as we use the Jenga tower), and nobody has lost any sanity points. But we do not have our weapons and armor, and the DM informs us that we hear growling and snarling a couple of floors below, and better pick up the pace.    \n\nBut that is not the way of Denethor the Ranger. Denethor is a practical man. We come across the skeleton of some poor soul in the tower, and I ask to identify it. It's an ogre's skeleton. Excellent.    \n\n\"I put the ogre's skeleton on as armor.\"     \n\nThe party stares at me in silence. The DM tells me to move a piece of the tower. I do. I start to put my bone armor on. The DM informs me that the cloth I was wearing gets ripped in the process, so I am now nude, inside of an ogre skeleton.    \n\nWhatever. Ready for battle.    \n\nWe proceed through some puzzles, and get to the very end, and to the shock of the DM, not a single person has knocked over the tower (despite my escapades making it harder for everyone).    \n\nFinally, we reach a door that upon opening, we are granted a vision of the destruction Cthulhu plans to bring upon the world, as well as a glimpse of the next city that we need to go to in our quest.    \n\nA portal opens in the next room, and the tower begins to shake. The party quickly figures that the tower that has somehow not fallen yet is finally giving way, and run to the portal. The entire party has left, but not Denethor.    \n\nDenethor is a man of showmanship.    \n\n\"I climb out the window to the top of the tower.\"\n\n\"You realize that if the tower falls, you'll still lose sanity, right?\"\n\n\"Did I stutter?\"\n\nThe DM allows it, but since the tower is collapsing, he rules that it's more difficult to move the Jenga piece to proceed. I may only use one *finger* to push the piece out.    \n\nAfter all the tense moments that the party had with the tower up to that point, this was almost impossible. But Denethor is not a man to back down. The tables goes silent, and in one quick motion, I push the piece out, and my Ranger climbs to the roof of the tower.    \n\nDM informs me that the tower will no longer stand, and is sinking into the sand. He asks what my final action will be in this dream world.     \n\n\"Are there any musical instruments on the roof?\"    \n\n\"Move a tower piece, and find out.\"\n\nSomehow, I manage to do so once again, although this time I rotated the whole damn tower a bit, and the whole table held their breath. The tower stopped wobbling and still stood, and the whole table sighed in relief.    \n\nThe DM tells me that I found a violin on the roof, and I proceed to play the song that the violinists played as the Titanic sank in to the ocean.    \n\nThe DM was laughing so hard, that not only did I not lose sanity for failing to exit the dream properly, but he awarded me an extra point of CN.    \n\nTL;DR : First ever Pathfinder session. Knocked unconscious before even taking an action. Try not to go crazy in Cthulu-induced dream. Act crazy without losing sanity. Come out of the dream stronger.\n\nEDIT: Reddit is dumb, and won't let me fix the name to Cthulhu",

Last session we found ourselves in a creepy abandoned town that had been taken over by a wraith and it's wraith spawn. We encountered the wraith in a old house first, it phases through a wall and proceeds to attack everyone which wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't also dealing constitution damage as well. I manage to drive it off with some +1 arrows and we decide to chase it back to its hideout. We get there and it hits our gnome woth a sneak attack dropping her to around 5hp. Thankfully I had prepared an action to shoot the thing if it popped up. I hit it, it goes down everyone cheers, and Roland the Ranger (much to his displeasure) is kissed by Higgs the gnome for saving his ass. About 30min later (real world time) my DM looks up and says \"hey, what kind of arrows were you shooting the wraith with?\" \"+1\" I reply. He's quiet for a minute then says \"oh goddamnit. Those arrows should have been doing half damage. Higgs should be dead.\" He is still rather salty about the ordeal\n\nTLDR: DM forgets that magic weapons only do half damage on incorporeal enemies and as a result we avoid our first party death.",

        "text": "**/r/dndgreentext has been having trouble with my submission, so I'm placing it here instead. Enjoy! EDIT: [Here it is.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDGreentext/comments/4c9ewy/jesus_plays_pathfinder/)**\n\n##Prologue\n\nThis story, like all tabletopping stories, starts in a tavern. \n\nThis one was in Portland, Oregon. Karaoke night. I was drunk and had just finished a rendition of \"Wonderboy\" when I got a text from a friend, henceforth referred to as \"Orcbro.\"\n\n&gt; *\"Hey bro! I apologize for the late text and don't worry about replying until the morning but what are your Easter Day plans?\"*\n\nApparently, he had just gotten the all-clear from his DM to invite a friend to their ongoing tabletop campaign. We had been talking about playing together for a while, but this was the first solid positive news. I jumped at the chance. \n\n&gt; *\"Alrighty! We are Pathfinder level 7 and currently we are kinda lacking in cleric and rogue though I don't wanna hinder your choices lol\"*\n\nCleric or rogue. Jeez, there are a lot of build possibilities there. I usually like to have some sort of character inspiration before...\n\n*Easter Day plans.*\n\nLaughing out loud, I briefly considered rolling up an albino thief with long ears who reverse-pickpockets colored eggs into everyone's inventory, but that seemed a bit too trollish for never having met most of the other players before. Okay, so I guess maybe some sort of Easter cleric then...\n\nOh. \n\nOh Lawd yes. \n\n----\n\n##Blessings of God\n\nI walk up to the table and find Orcbro and his wife, along with the DM and the rest of the players. I act super nice, do favors for the DM like giving him my only soda and puppeteering his pocket healer DMPC during an insanely complicated combat. I'm pretty sure I'm 50% method acting, 50% apologizing for the sacreligious character sheet I'm about to show him. \n\nThe time finally comes, and sweating, I whip out a Community/Charm domain cleric named Gabbatha Zuss, or just Zuss. (I decided that G. Zuss would be giving away the joke a bit too early.) Heal, Diplomacy, and Carpentry are all up to +14, thanks to feats and insane Charisma and Wisdom stats. I'm armed with a spear, three darts, and a heavy wooden shield crafted out of two huge beams. (And you can already guess that I have Create Food and Water, Water Walking, and Bless Water as readied spells.) The DM freaks out a bit seeing that I'm almost broke, but I assure him that I think the character would only be worth 30 silver pieces. He doesn't have any other problems, aside from making me take out my Leadership feat because there's already technically about 12 player-controlled characters on the map. \n\nThis is going even better than I could have planned. \n\nThe players had just nearly been killed wiping out a demon general's camp in the Underdark, and found me tied up in the general's tent with a long strip of flesh missing from my leg. Apparently the demons had been using my body as a food source. I can only hope that they ate it in remembrance of me. \n\nI described myself as being dark tan, on the skinny side, with bushy black hair and beard. The players start arguing about whether to kill me, so I Channel Positive Energy and heal them all for about 20 HP. \"Peace be with you,\" I say. Orcbro isn't convinced and tries to intimidate me...but [Jesus saves.](http://orig12.deviantart.net/9660/f/2008/169/6/8/jesus_saves_by_valkyrist.jpg) I smile at him warmly, unaffected, and say \"And also with you.\" The DM informed them all that I was emanating a strong Good aura, which was good enough for the party--they untied me and went back to arguing about who gets what loot.\n\nOrcbro is the only one trying to roleplay with me, I think he wants my first Pathfinder experience to be a good one. \n\n\"How long you been here??\" he growls.\n\n\"Three days,\" I say gravely. \"I had faith that I would return from the Underworld.\"\n\n\"What was demon general doing?\"\n\n\"The Prince of Darkness was summoning an army. He who lives by the sword, dies by the sword.\"\n\nI'm studying Orcbro's face closely for a flicker of a smirk. Nothing. I might be able to get away with this joke for a little while longer. \n\nMeanwhile, the players have finished divvying up the loot. The DM elbows them, reminding them to make sure the new guy gets some stuff. \n\n\"It's not about what you can do for me, it's what I can do for you,\" I say.\n\nThey stick me with a broken chain mail shirt. DM uses his god powers to sneak me a Wand of Metamagic.\n\n*Thank you, Father.*\n\nThe party catches me up to speed on what they were doing down here. Apparently they're all mercenaries under contract to resolve a political dispute between the Drow/Duergar and the Elves/Dwarves. The granddaughter of a dwarvish noble has been captured, and we have been commissioned to return her, dead or alive. They ask me whether a holy man such as myself is all right working with folk of such ill repute. I reply that I've traveled with worse: tax collectors, etc. I'm still waiting for the penny to drop, but they just shrug and decide to rest up. Orcbro's wife, who's playing a sylph, summons a lagoon and invites my character to rest on the banks. I have to resist very hard to not wash her feet. \n\n----\n\n##But The Underdark Did Not Receive Him\n\nWe wake up, and the first order of business is going to the nearest town to pawn off all the valuables they snagged. The closest city is run by the Drow and the Duergar, and pretty much only one person is permitted to enter without being killed on sight: Orcbro. Thanks to some past bluff rolls, he is now regarded as a professional human hunter. \n\nZuss doesn't care about the potential danger. All he cares about is the lost souls in the Underdark. \n\nI raise my hand. \"I shall go with him.\" \n\nThe players all start to laugh, but I insist. They shrug and say that maybe I can pretend to be Orcbro's prisoner. But I'm still gonna die.\n\n*It is written.*\n\nHe drags me in with a cart full of arms and armor. I follow, hands bound in manacles. The guards posted at the gate draw back in respect at the sight of Orcbro, but advance again, sneering, when they see the human. Orcbro growls and keeps walking through, brushing them off, but I still get a polearm to the ribs as we enter the city. \n\nOrcbro sets up in front of a merchant's to haggle over prices, as I wait in the streets. Passersby jostle me over and over, dealing 20 points of nonlethal damage overall. I declare that I want to try Diplomacy on a pedestrian. \n\nI roll 28. \n\nThe DM's confusion and the pedestrian's confusion are indistinguishable. The Duergar steps forward, the power of Christ compelling him. \n\n\"Friend, you look as though you are suffering. Would you like me to give you healing and rest?\"\n\nThe players laugh. \"Jesus, he's starting his own religion...!\"\n\n*That is equally true in past tense.*\n\nThe NPC's face twists in rage.\n\n\"You brought a *CLERIC?*\" he screams at Orcbro.\n\nOrcbro decides it is time for us to leave. \n\nAs we briskly walk away from the area, we can hear rumors and whispers flying through the crowd. Soon, it's become a few dozen people outright stalking us through the streets, angrily muttering and cursing. \n\nI roll Diplomacy again. I want to tell them a parable, I say to the DM.\n\n\"There once was a Drow who fell ill by the side of the road. Another Drow saw him and passed by. A Duergar also saw the suffering Drow and went on without helping. But a Human who was traveling that same road stopped and healed him of his wounds. Now, which one of these was true ally to the Matriarch?\"\n\nOrcbro decides it is time for me to stop talking. He apologizes out of character and starts smacking me to bring me to 0 HP. I swear to Dad, it takes exactly three times as we walk this road of trials. After Zuss's third stumble, Orcbro lifts my body and tosses it onto the back of the cart. \n\nI wake up in, again I swear to Dad, a large, ornate military hall, with a Drow governess residing. *This is the point where they say 'bring us Barabbas,' right?* Orcbro is trying and failing to convince her to let me live. I notice that to the side of the room, chained to the wall naked within a thick cage, is the Dwarven granddaughter we have been searching for. She is wearing a ring that will drain the life out of her in order to help the Drow governess achieve her ascension. \n\n*It's John 3:16 time.*\n\nI fall out of the cart and speak just barely loud enough for the governess to hear. \n\n\"If you want me, let me take her place. Let the dwarf go, and I will die in her stead.\"\n\n----\n\n##I Shall Return\n\nAt this point, the DM decided to wrap because he needed to plan for the inevitable boss battle. Orcbro wasn't really talking to me, I think he was disappointed that I was having such a bad time that I wanted to kill my character. I helped clean up, and apologized to everyone for making a character with \"such a savior complex.\" \n\nThen I looked them all in the eyes and said *\"Happy Easter.\"* \n\n[MFW still no one gets it.](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/69/8b/d2/698bd27fd31dd49aeed9aa709636c966.jpg)\n\n[MFW I have to play as Jesus again in two weeks.](https://media.makeameme.org/created/please-lord-give.jpg)\n\n[MFW I'm not sure whether I'm going to hell.](http://www.theescapist.com/darkdung12.jpg)\n\n\n#[Part 1.5](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/4edhad/jesus_plays_pathfinder_part_15/)",

        "text": "Rikza shadowed Barnaby and followed the First Mate, Barnaby, to  him to the lower quarters of the ship. Barnaby wanders into the storage room and walks to the farthest end of it, searching for who-knows-what. Rikza examined his surroundings and saw this as his best chance, albeit the riskiest. He crept forwards towards the Orc, who still had his back turned. Moving silently, growing ever-closer to his prey… he drew his dagger when he was about 3 paces away from the First Mate. Captain Striggan would have an open position in his ranks before the day’s end. Finally, Rikza was upon Barnaby and stabbed the Orc in the back as deeply as he could manage. It wasn’t enough to kill the thick-skinned brute, but it was definitely a devastating blow. \n\nThe sharp pain caused Barnaby to panic briefly and attempt to pull back, but he found himself against a wall with his assailant upon him. He drew his colossal glaive and attempted to fight back, but found his weapon to be of no use in a space too small for him to maneuver it. Rikza followed the initial stab with a flurry of slashes and cuts like a storm of blades, all the while dodging kicks from Barnaby. He was a resilient and clearly seasoned Orc warrior, but even Barnaby succumbed to blood loss, though only after his corpse more closely resembled a freshly-flayed steer than a person. \n\nThe first obstacle on their road to usurping Captain Striggan was removed. Rikza was impressed with his quick and efficient, yet a bit disappointed. He had hoped that a warrior as strong as Barnaby would have been a more difficult mark. Rikza noticed the puddles of blood on the floorboards and the blood that was beginning to stain his clothes. He found a crate full of rags and began to clean himself and the floor of the evidence, throwing the used cloths and Barnaby’s body into the crate for hiding. Hopefully all would be said and done before anyone would have to come down here.\n\nBalthazar and Rikza encountered each other up on deck. They exchanged glances and gave the other an affirming nod. Balthazar had the same smug look he had on his face any time he succeeded, and Rikza wore the stoic and determined look he was accustomed too. Though very different in their natures, they were both similarly proud of the work they each had done. \n\nJust then, something shook the ship and everyone could hear the sound of the ocean’s surface breaking. Something big had come out of the Sea of Swords and was making its way onto the ship! The whole crew readied for battle. Balthazar drew his favorite rapier and dagger, Rikza pulled out his dagger, Mordecai readied his bow up in the crow’s nest, and Lydian pulled out her small crossbow. They were ready for the moment this entity climbed onto the deck. To their surprise, they found themselves face to face with a pair of crab beasts from the Sea of Swords. The ship was under attack and the Captain was nowhere to be seen. The 4 crewmates wondered if they were pirates or pest control, given the day they’ve had. They engaged one of the crab beasts on the bow end of the Sentinel while the other was distracted by the Dwarf and an Elven crewmate on the stern end. \n\nThe hard chitinous shells of the monsters proved to be as resilient as anyone could have guessed, but their fleshy parts were soft and vulnerable. Balthazar took careful aim to plunge his rapier into the most vulnerable spots, which earned him no reward other than a very annoyed crab beast clutching him in its vicegrips. He struggled for his freedom as the sharp ridges of the crab’s claws begun to dig into his ribs. \n\n“How ironic,” he thought, “I always dreamed of eating crab in the lap of luxury, now I might die to crabs in the belly of poverty. You all had better not let me die to this bottom-feeder!” At that, his crewmates pondered if they should free him at all. Nevertheless they continued to barrage the crustacean with blade and arrow, and eventually Balthazar managed to wriggle free and deliver the coup-de-grace to the shelled menace. The two fighting on the other end of the ship had managed to kill their beast as well, but not before it took the life of the elven crewmate.\n\nFinally, Captain Striggan emerged from his quarters with his second mate, a bigger yet dumber Orc than Barnaby named Grug. He saw the lifeless elf lying on deck and muttered something about what a waste it was. Before anyone, namely Balthazar, had the opportunity to spout out any snide remarks, Striggan had begun barking orders at them immediately. \n\n“Line up for roll call you!” The collective tongue-biting among the crew was almost audible as they all held their comments to themselves and followed Striggan’s orders obediently. After going up and down the line calling names, he finally got to the name that Rikza feared. \n\n“Barnaby... Barnaby! Where the hell’s the First Mate?”\n\nEveryone was silent.",

        "text": " **The continued tale of Malaney Belrue.** [Click here for previous chapter.](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/4bkn22/dnd_5e_great_bouts_of_change_pt_4/)\n\n✻   ✻   ✻   ✻   ✻\n\nI managed the impossible! I punched Kimaris in the nose! Granted I feel bad in spite of myself, but I’m reveling in the fact that I had the strength enough to inflict such a strike! Alas, I shouldn’t, but there really is something to favor in triumph.\n\nKimaris had his back to me when I approached. He wore a richly made tunic about his form. It was gaudy, yet more becoming of him over his nakedness. I took a deep breath and dived in.\n\n“Hey,” I called out. Kimaris shifted his weight to look at me. He lifted his eyebrows, silently asking what I wanted. An exasperated sigh escaped my lips. “Look Kimaris, you and I clearly got off on the wrong foot. Most certainly I'm a thorn in your side as you are in mine,” I told him. My companion nodded, seeming impatient. I began to feel unsure of what I was doing and so rushed on by proposing a truce.\n\n“How do you expect this ‘truce’ to work?” Kimaris questioned. And so I listed off the two options:\n\n1. He could leave me be- meaning no touching, talking, or referring to me in front of or behind my back. \n\nHe didn’t look to like the first as I explained it. Or,\n\n2. He teaches me how to defend myself.\n\nKimaris’s head snapped up to look at me. I’m sure he was gauging my seriousness to which I added, “Think about it. You’ll get to enjoy knocking me around some more and I hopefully will get a few punches in myself.”\n\nThe latter felt lame and I thought Kimaris would have jumped at the opportunity, but instead he asked, “Why?”\n\nSo I confessed to him, “Because I need to be able to protect myself. I’m tired of being so pathetic and fighting against you certainly isn’t making it any better.” The sting my pride took was manageable. I don’t like that I agreed with Kimaris about my uselessness. I had then braced myself for the gloating, but instead, my companion got to his feet and said, “Hit me.”\n\n“Now?” I questioned. He confirmed, instructing me again to hit him, tapping his nose as the target. I almost refused, but remembered I needed to be serious. The boy was giving me a chance. With fists clenched and positioned in front of me, I let my right hand jab out. It hit him squarely on the cheek, the impact surprising me some.\n\n“Sorry,” I automatically said.\n\n“Is that really all you got?” Kimaris asked. It shocked me to no end that my strike wasn't hard enough, so I doubted his words at first. He insisted that I strike harder, adding, “I’ve done plenty to make you angry, so hit me!”\n\n“Just because you’ve made me angry doesn’t mean that I should make it physical,” I minded him. The boy then pushed my shoulder with the tips of his fingers. I rubbed the spot, which turned to an itch on the backside of my shoulder. Kimaris pushed me again to which I pushed back asking him what his problem was.\n\n“Hit me!” he demanded. It then clicked. We were sparring! So quickly I brought my fist up and sent another punch to his cheek. Like the first, it did little to appease my companion. After each punch he’d shout, “Harder!” After the fifth time repeating his request, I let out a frustrated cry of my own and hit his nose. I had only meant to hit him hard enough to shut him up, and not only did I manage that, but a crack rippled under my fist.\n\nImmediately I apologized as the blood began to trickle down his face. I went to heal him, but Kimaris refused me. Instead he smiled his coy grin I was becoming all too familiar with and said, “I knew you had it in you.”\n\nThat statement alone is enough to baffle me. It was that softness again that seemed contrary to my companion’s nature. But it didn’t stop at that line. Kimaris then helped me grasp my potential:\n\n“Why not put that kind of strength forward when you’re fighting- or rather when we were fighting those skeletons the last few days?”\n\n“Because I’m not a fighter.”\n\n“You should be. You can’t expect to never fend for yourself.”\n\n“I understand that, hence why I want to learn how to defend myself.”\n\n“Is that all you’ll use it for?”\n\n“Of course. I’m not going to go around and pick fights just because I can.”\n\n“But understand that even in defending you may have to choose to take a life.”\n\n“I will not!” I was truly surprised by such a bold statement. Kimaris, however, was quite serious.\n\n“What about those who murdered your father? Wouldn’t you like to see them killed?”\n\n“It matters not what I want. If we find them, we’ll take them to the Paladins and use the evidence to convict them.”\n\n“Alright. But what if there is no evidence- or worse yet, they get off scott free anyways. Wouldn’t you want to bring your justice upon them?”\n\nIt really bothered me that he was trying to get me to condone murder, and so I tried to remind him of our mortality by firmly saying, “I have no right to decide who dies! That responsibility lies with the Gods!”\n\nThe moment I said ‘Gods,’ my voice faltered as a wave of understanding washed over me. It’s hard to describe, but one moment I was very much in denial that I was a Primordial, but suddenly, I am. I always have been, I just lack the memories.\n\nKimaris noticed my second epiphany and leaned in close to me, saying, “Now you get it? We’re greater than the Gods!”\n\nI pursed my lips. In that moment we were very much not greater than the Gods. In time, we will be, but in that moment I couldn’t agree. Let alone, at the same time, Bordel had returned, expressing his disapproval to such a notion. \n\nFern and Oda arrived shortly thereafter as I cleaned Kimaris up. We enjoyed a meal of venison and I entertained a moment with my lyre. While sitting around the fire I learned that Oda was from these parts, though it’s been decades since he’s returned. I envied him that he was able to enjoy such comfort of being home. Dread is what laces my veins.\n\nI say, this whole day has been one for the eternities. The dynamics of our party, especially between me and Kimaris, has been tried relentlessly. How is it possible that the ire I felt toward the boy has suddenly been resolved, or at least for the night? It just doesn’t seem possible.\n\nI’m also concerned about what ill opinion I might have gained with Bordel. I suppose much can’t be helped with that other than to move forward.",

        "text": "Let’s say that you are a skeleton, and that you don’t know how or why.  You hide your… condition under expensive clothes, scraps of dead tissue, and a great deal of cosmetics, but at the end of the day you can’t say you are satisfied with your current lot in life.\n\n\nSo you steal some necromancy tomes from the archives of the local zombie cult,  climb down to a nice deserted ledge in the sub-city Catacombs, and start reading.  Two of the books you snagged stink of black magic (more so than you would expect, anyway), so you quarantine them just a bit further down the side of the cliff as a precaution in case they are cursed.\n\nLet’s say your silent study session is interrupted by a shadowy sneak snatching your stash!\n\nSo you jump down from your cozy reading ledge to beat them up and maybe reanimate them as your eternal undead lackey if you are feeling charitable.  They stab you in the neck with a wickedly serrated dagger, but you don’t care - under all the extra flesh you are a skeleton.  You engage in a brief fistfight on the side of a chasm, but your skele-fu just isn’t up to snuff today and you are unable to steal your ill-gotten gains back.\n\nLet’s say you happen to remember ‘Wait a second - I’m also a wizard.  Fuck.’  You say so out loud and then use death magic to reinforce and strengthen yourself.  Faced with ~~the power of calcium~~ your necromantic might, they bolt.  This is a very understandable and honestly quite common reaction.\nSo you chase them, and for several hours a very irritating game of cat and mouse takes place throughout the undercity.  \nThey can’t outrun you, because you are a skeleton and don’t eat, sleep, breathe, or tire.  You can’t catch them though, because you are a skeleton and dexterity is not part of that particular package.\n\nThey can’t lose you in the dark and twisting tunnels because you can taste the wretched energy pouring off the stolen books and know these paths like the back of your metacarpals.  You can’t use that to ambush them though, because as a sneaky rogue they are crafty and knowledgeable in the ancient art of evading ambushes. \n\nLet’s say you eventually catch up and see your prize sitting undefended on the edge of a ravine.  ‘Wow’, you think, ‘That is such an obvious tra-’  The sneak springs from her hiding spot and kicks you off the cliff.  \n\nOf course, your skele-fu is much improved by your enhanced strength and hours of intense frustration.\n\nSo you do the sensible thing and drag her right over the edge with you.  You don’t mind, because you are a skeleton and you are starting to worry that this messes with your perception of physical danger a little bit. Fortunately, the squishy human manages to cushion your fall, and you hit the bottom of the ravine with a crunch.  You aren’t entirely sure which one of you it came from - both, probably -  but then again you don’t really care.    After all, you are (unfortunately, for now and possibly forever) a skeleton.  Oh well.  You finally caught the sneak!\nThe sense of triumph is fleeting.  Like someone once told you, every silver lining by definition has to bring an awful lot of cloud along with it.  You did not notice earlier, because in addition to not breathing or eating you also do not feel, at least not in the same way that you used to.  \n\nYou look like something the cat dragged in.   Your expensive clothes and once passably-alive skin are utterly ruined - sliced to ribbons doesn’t do you or your attire justice, and what is left is stained with all manner of unspeakable things.  You did just spend the last several hours running through caves and sewers.  \nLet’s say that, unlike much of the rest of you, these things are not so easily replaced.\n\nSo you kick the unconscious?  dead?  thief a few times for good measure (as it turns out, you are NOT feeling charitable today) and begin what is sure to be a delightful and very very long journey back to your books.",

        "text": "We've all had that awkward meeting with the locals of a party member's hometown. Sometimes you all meet in the local dive. Other times a party member splits off on their own. Sometimes it goes well. Mostly... Mostly it does not. Gather round, and hear my tale about one of those times it goes... well... you'll see.\n\nLet us skip ahead from [our last tale](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/488lad/pathfinder_oh_im_not_that_type_of_guardsman/) of Guardsman Cain, back when a bad diplomacy check lead him to believe one of his party members was... excited to meet him, we'll say.\n\nThe party was traveling one of the towns Guardsman Cain had previously been posted in to investigate claims of heresy. They started by being drawn by will o' wisps to a ruined graveyard. Not exactly a good beginning. The Wisps accused the party of defiling the local graves-marks of heresy abounded. Now, while this party had done worse to relics in the past, this time they were not at fault. And so they offered to help the wisps kill whoever was responsible. \n\n\"And how could you do such a thing?\" the wisps wondered. \n\n\"Why, don't you know who you are speaking to?\" the party's Occultist scoffed. \"This,\" he exclaimed, pointing at Cain, \"Is Ciaphas Cain, the HERO OF THE IMPERIUM! He has slaughtered countless foes, and saved towns across these lands! He has righted many wrongs, and rooted out heresy throughout the realm! Doubt thee of his ability?\"\n\nThe Hawkman blew on his cape to provide a +2 assist. It didn't count.\n\nHowever, the Wisps agreed. This truly was a hero, one they should have heard about in their time of the living, and one of them was young enough to remember Guardsman Cain. With a warning of only 7 days to find the defilers, the party was allowed passage and continued on. Halfway down the road, the Occultist finally failed his will check and started giggling.\n\nAfter a brief period of travel, the party reached BlueBarry. It was a quiet town, known for its southern hospitality and general lack of anything exciting outside of the parties they would throw for visitors. A perfect example of southern backwater, the majority of the party went to the inn with a sagging roof. Guardsman Ciaphas Cain was not exactly happy to be back, but went off to see his local squad anyway. The locals spoke of an upcoming party the local lord (or what passed for a lord in these parts) was about to throw for some visiting dignitaries. Cain secured a place in the security detail, and excused himself to find some drink. The GM informed the player that their crush, Suzy, was bartending that evening. Suzy noticed Ciaphas enter, and dropped the glass she was cleaning with stunned recognition. She motioned him over, exclaiming \"Lil'... Lil' Cyrus... is that you? Bah gawd, you have grown!\" \n\nThe Aasamir spit his drink out.\n\n\"Why yes, Suzy, it is me,\" Cain said, glaring at the Aasamir. \"And it is good to be back.\" As Ciaphas was bantering with his old flame, the rest of the party was doing their best to try and get Ciaphas laid. Which was admittedly hard for a creepy dude with a bleeding scythe and a guy with horns. \n\nStill, they tried. And to everyone's surprise, they did.\n\nHow, you might ask? For a full minute, the occultist sang the song \"[The Hero of the Imperium.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8omJvCrwRdY)\"  The lyrics went a little something like this:\n\n&gt;Cain!\n\n&gt;The man they call Cain!\n\n&gt;He robbed from the rich and he gave to the poor.\n\n&gt;Stood up to the man and he gave him what for.\n\n&gt;Our love for him now, ain't hard to explain,\n\n&gt;The hero of the Imperium, the man they call Cain!\n\nAnd that was how The Hero of The Imperium got laid. \n\nHe lasted seven seconds.",

Human. \n\nHuman bad. Human were sharp.\n\nHe began to dig hidey hole \n\nHe wasn't scared\n\nHe so smart\n\nGhermeeb also brave. So brave that he didn't pee himself when the human grabbed him by the tail and ripped him out of the ground.\n\nHe was tall and mean looking with a hard scared face framed by graying hair. He wore a strange suit of leather armor, with knives and other strange tools strapped to almost every inch.\n\n\"Heh. Found you\", he rumbled in his gravelly voice.\n\nGhermeeb was so brave that he desperately attempted to free himself and run away.\n\nThe human laughed and said, \"Now now, none of that.\"\n\nGhermeeb stopped, and accepted his death with only a few tears.\n\nHe so brave.\n\nBut death didn't come. \n\nInstead the human tied Ghermeeb up, dumped him in a sack and carried him back to town. The bag muffled most noises, but Ghermeeb, so smart, managed to poke one ear out of the bags hole, and hear the human speak. \n\n\"-ound him in the forest, hiding near a dead deer. Wouldn't a found the sneaky bastard if he didn't leave a blood trail.\"\n\nGhermeeb didn't think of that.\n\nHe so dumb.\n\n\nA second human responded. \n\n\"So you think a Kobold can do it? When I offered you this bet I was thinking you know, something bigger?\"\n\n\"The bet was to make a monster into a rogue right? Small things sneak well.\"\n\nGhermeeb felt a rough hand grab his head and rip him out of the sack. The gray human smiled. \"We've got work to do buddy. Let's go.\" \n\nThe next day Ghermeeb learned one thing.\n\nHe stupid, slow, loud, and weak.\n\nHe wanted to be like Gray human. Gray human was strong. He steal the clothes of your back and you would have no idea. \n\nMuch to his surprise, Gray human, who he just called Gray,  began to teach Ghermeeb. He would make Ghermeeb sneak into town, and steal things. For every gold disc he got back, Gray would give him a treat. Ghermeeb liked this game. After two years he could sneak into prison, lock himself up, and escape all without anyone knowing he was there.\n\nOnce he finished learning how to hide, he learned how to fight. It was painful, and Gray human hit him a lot but Ghermeeb knew that he wanted to be strong, and this was the best way. \n\nFinally, on the fifth year he and Gray embarked on his \"final test\"\n\nThey were to  kill a King.\n\nGray and Ghermeeb soundlessly climbed the black walls in the dead of night. They snuck past the guards who were so drunk they barely noticed when Ghermeeb slit their throats, and climbed through an open window into a trap. \n\nFifteen royal guardsmen waited, all armed and armored with expensive and well maintained arms and armor.  \n\nFor the first time in five years, Ghermeeb felt a twinge of fear.\n\nGray unsheathed his knives, and Ghermeeb followed. \n\n\"Can't we just you know, talk it out fellas?\"\n\nThey charged and Gray rushed to meet them. \n\nIt was his last battle. \n\nGhermeeb and Gray fought hard, whirling around the guards blades, stabbing through chinks in their armors but a lucky spear thrust from the last guard pierced Gray's tough leather chest plate.\n\nWith a howl of rage Ghermeeb picked up a slain guards broadsword, and ran the murderer through. He let the man fall to the ground and rushed to Gray's side. \n\nThe tall spat some blood onto the floor and put a hand on Ghermeebs scaley forehead.\n\n\"Buddy, I might not have said it a lot, but you'll be a damn fine rogue.\"\n\nHe paused to cough. It was a wet painful sounding thing, and a bit of blood dribbled out of Gray's mouth. \n\nGhermeeb wiped it away with his claw and grabbed his healing potion, but Gray stopped him.\n\n\"Ain't no potion fixin this buddy. Save it for yourself.\"\n\nGhermeeb forced back a sob. \"Gray no. Get up Gray.\"\n\nGray closed his eyes and Ghermeeb began to shake him. \"Get up Gray. Don't die Gray. Please Gray. Why? Gray why?\"\n\nHe never moved.\n\nGhermeeb so alone.\n\nGhermeeb grabbed Gray's knives.\n\nGhermeeb would make Gray proud.\n\nGhermeeb would kill them all.",

        "text": "1: So in my second session with the party (me, a LN human fighter, a CN gnome warlock, and a CN half-elf bard) we fought off an ogre attack with help from the town guard,  though the town guard did NOTHING but draw aggro as a vaguely useful blob of bodies. At one point I accidentally rolled a range attack as a fighter and threw one of my handaxes, nailing the ogre in the shoulder, and then after we brought it to the brink of death we, we being the party and town guard combined, spend an untold number of turns unable to either hit or do appreciable damage to the ogre, and when finally we kill it our warlock is so SICK of this whole thing that when the DM asks him how he wants to execute it, he selects a magic missile enema, exploding the ogre spectacularly and showering everyone for several blocks in gore. Also wedging my handaxe into a wall never to be retrieved. Luckily everybody kept their lunches down. After this a powerful necromancer comes out of nowhere and hits us with a prismatic spray, evidently killing the ogres has forced a somewhat early BBEG confrontation, petrifying our warlock and crippling the rest of the party, but some quick thinking by the bard forces him to retreat after only one turn by destroying his magic focus.\n\n2: After the ogres wreck half the town the mayor holds us accountable and we have to go kill 4 trolls that have been plaguing the town for some time. Also the warlock mysteriously un-petrifies. While in the forest one of them attacks us and very nearly kills the entire party, with the warlock failing to actually land any attacks save for a crossbow bolt that the troll instantly regenerates, we eventually set the troll on fire and reduce him to rolling around in pain and panic after he downs our bard, whose player is shouting at us while we spend nearly 5 turns failing to do ANY damage to the troll until it finally succumbs to burn damage.\n\n3:We rest after that horrible fight...so the bard has a curse causing him to suffer a different detrimental affect after each rest, and this time...he smells. So while the rest of us are suffering through the smell one of the trolls is actually DRAWN to it...so we have another fight on our hands but this time we know to set it on fire immediately, and it goes much more smoothly, but our warlock finally manages to land a hit, in the process we find that he struck a deal with his god to undo the petrification, and as a consequence he now has wild magic... Fortunately the second troll goes down easy and we find the third already dead.\n\n4: Having killed 2 trolls and agreed to claim we killed a third we now track them to their lair to kill the final troll...unfortunately there are 3 trolls we didn't know about with him, and he has an enchanted giant warhammer. My first instinct is to run away, but after the warlock takes a hit I decide to go back to being the party tank and start setting the trolls on fire. Fortunately the \"king\" troll with the hammer fails a save and his hammer throws him into a berserk rage, attacking the other 3 with impunity and nearly outright killing one before we ever have to confront it. Unfortunately our Warlock's luck gets worse, he crit fails not once, but 3 times, first lighting himself on fire, then firing his crossbow in the opposite direction from the trolls, and finally managing to conjure only a fart noise and a puff of smoke, while I bear the brunt of the troll's attacks. There's also a high elf wizard in a cage suspended over the clearing who helps us out with a few magic missiles, but after a hard fought battle defined by nearly 4-5 turns of constant misses and another 4-5 turns of poor damage rolls while the trolls slowly burn to death, we emerge victorious and release the wizard from the cage. We all 4 then fail arcana checks on the obviously enchanted warhammer.\n\n5: As we make our way back to town to return the treasure stolen by the trolls we are introducing ourselves to the wizard, who casually identifies himself as a necromancer. The entire party stops dead to stare at him as he elaborates that he lived in isolation for some time and was raised by wolves (the DM swears this is the actual backstory he rolled) prompting everyone to smile and laugh it off as all a joke...until he summons an undead horse in front of everyone, prompting my fighter to ready his weapon and prepare to defend the others from the undead creature...until the necromancer mounts the horse and asks that I not kill his horse.\n\nWe still have to go back to town and confront the mayor, who is obviously corrupt and threatened to mutilate our then-petrified warlock if we didn't cooperate and kill the trolls, but now we have to do so with a necromancer who doesn't understand that necromancy isn't kosher and was literally raised by wolves. It's no longer a question of if my character can get the others in and out of town without them committing any crimes but more whether or not we can reach the mayor without the town guard attacking us.",

        "text": "[Our game](https://sfvampires.wordpress.com) is very fortunate. We've been running (nearly) every week, with the same group of people, for almost three years straight; a situation which, for adults with busy lives, I understand is preciously rare. As a result of this, we've become very good with our characters (or, at least, the ones who haven't died) and the world they live in.\n\nSome of us have apparently gotten much, much, *much* better than others.\n\nDue to complicated circumstances, one of our players, Chris, has wound up with two PC characters simultaneously. One of them, Paul Stewart, is a Silicon Valley tech-magnate Toreador with a heart-he-is-desperately-trying-to-keep-gold. He was the first character Chris developed for this game and has come in and out of the main plot as circumstances allow. Chris's *other* current character was developed long after Chris became familiar with the game and has a very different feel from Paul. His name is Lord Augustus von Rabenholz, an aristocratic Ventrue(?) with designs on taking over the city and a heart of cold steel. \n\nNow, due to their differences, and to maintain GM sanity, most of the time these characters have been kept well separate from each other. But of course, players being players, the moment we realized how much it would upset our GM, the rest of us agreed that we *had* to get these two together at some point. The GM has been able to navigate out of most of these attempts, but in a recent scene his attention lapsed enough that the inevitable finally happened.\n\nThe following scene is set at Paul's house, where he, PC Georgia, Georgia's ghoul Bob, and two gargoyles named Domen and Dug have gathered after Paul's daring raid on the Chantry to rescue the imprisoned Georgia (and also a werewolf and a Hermetic mage but they're still unconscious at the moment so glossing over that--) Georgia, though, is also \"friends\" with Lord Rabenholz and called to inform him of her escape and location as soon as she could. Various dramas and discussions occur at the house, until....\n\n[Part 1](http://raptor.zombox.org/vampire_recordings/2015_11_19_Chris_self_play.mp3)\n\nSo, amusing as this was, the *real* amazing bit happened a session or two later, where Chris once again played Paul and Rabenholz not only in a real-time conversation together, but actually *arguing* over their disparate interests, as Paul tries to negotiate the release of PC Tom Lytton, who was captured weeks before and is now in Rabenholz's possession:\n\n[Part 2](http://raptor.zombox.org/vampire_recordings/2015_12_03_Purchasing_Tom.mp3)\n\nConsidering that this campaign was the first RPG game Chris has ever been in, we're all in awe. And, realtalk, we're also more than a little frightened.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "By popular demand I've decided to share with you all the story of my first, and currently on-going, DnD campaign! Continuing from this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/4bpwd3/interest_test_balthazars_bizarre_adventure/ \n\nNow, without further ado, let the story begin!\n\nSession 1: All Aboard the Sentinel\n\t\nThe Sentinel; a mighty smuggling vessel. It may not have exactly been a military-grade ship, but you would be wise to stay out of its way regardless. The only thing more fierce than the ship itself was the master of the ship, Captain Striggan. He was a cruel and selfish man who went through crew members like a carpenter goes through tools. Onboard the Sentinel with him at this time was a particularly capable crew. There were his closest henchmen, the First and Second Mates. Both of them Orcs carrying weapons that were almost as oversized and menacing as themselves. Then there was the Dwarf. His apparent job seemed to be following the Captain around and looking menacing while trying to hide the brown on his nose. That being said, the whip that he always carried around, strapped to his waist gave everyone a good idea of his true purpose here. Anyone who thought of stepping out of line or questioning Striggan needed to only see the Dwarf and the whip to reconsider. There was the ship’s loveable Orcish chef, Jareec, whose meals became the talk of the ship! That is, if the crew was allowed to eat that day. There were a few other crewmates on the ship, each one fulfilling one oddjob or the other. Then there were Balthazar, Rikza, Lydian, and Mordecai. This motley crew were about to be set upon an adventure they won’t soon forget.\n\nCaptain Striggan made his usual rounds on the upper deck of the ship. Everyone was fulfilling their usual duties. Rikza and Lydian were swabbing the deck, Mordecai was up in the crow’s nest as he prefered, keeping an eye out in the distance, and Balthazar was tending to the sails. For once, all was well on the Sentinel and the Captain could return to his leisure time. Until he heard a skittering noise on the floorboards around his feet. Striggan peered down to find an oversized rat crawling by his feet. The Captain gave a sneer of disgust as his fury welled up inside him, and delivered a brutal stomp to the rat. If the volume of his thunderous stomp didn’t draw attention from the crew, then the varmint’s high-pitched death rattle definitely did. Everyone on deck, even Mordecai, stopped what they were doing to look at the Captain and the large rat. Striggan kicked the rat’s corpse off the side of the ship and took notice of his audience.\n\n“All of ya!” Striggan said in a gruff voice, “Don’t just stand there looking stoopid! Get yer sorry asses in my office! STAT!” The four crewmates put their jobs on hold and walked into the Captain’s Quarters to receive their new mission. When they came in through the door, the captain was sitting at his desk, and the Dwarf was cleaning the Captain’s boots of any rodent remains. \n\n“It appears that our fine vessel has a bit of an… infestation.” Striggan said to his crew. “The four of you are going to go down into the storage hold, investigate the problem, and kill any damn vermin you find down there. Understood?” \n\nThe four of them all nodded their heads in compliance and made their way to the stairs leading to the bowels of the ship where the storage hold lies. They stepped down into the dark storage room and were instantly greeted with an ear-grating mix of skittering and squeaking. Balthazar lit a torch, and had to reel for a moment at the sight of the storage hold. Rats were everywhere! It seemed like there were more rats in the storage than there was floor. A majority of their haul consisted of luxury good such as ivory and perfumes, which the rats were not interested in. What they were interested in, however, were what little food supplies the Sentinel had remaining. If the rodents weren’t stopped then everyone on board the ship would starve! The crew may not even last until they reach port in Baldur’s Gate. The four of them immediately went into action, except Rikza, who lingered by the stairs, swinging the torches around their feet to create openings for movement. They began stabbing, slashing, cutting, and doing anything they could to kill the hundreds of rats swarming around them. Balthazar noticed Rikza nonchalantly watching the action from a distance.\n\n“Care to help out or would ya rather let these rats eat your rations?!” He yelled toward the slacker. Rikza rolled his eyes and drew his dagger, joining in the mindless varmint slaughter. Eventually, the crew finished their errand. They could neither see nor hear anything else moving in the storage room. They left the grotesque scene to go report back to the Captain, hoping he would get someone else to do the deed of disposing of the rat corpses. \n\nBack at the Captain’s quarters the party reported their success to Captain Striggan. He congratulated them on their success as only he could. By giving them a passive “Good” and waving them off. After exchanging concerned glances to each other, Balthazar spoke out.\n\n“Captain, most of the crew won’t survive with what food we’ve got left, especially not after those rats got into the storeroom! We need to stop at the nearest port and restock!” Striggan looked at Balthazar and stifled his annoyance. How dare a lackey speak out against his captain?\n\n“This ship is heading straight for Baldur’s Gate! We’ve got a date to meet and we will not make any more stops!” Striggan was putting his foot down. He would not waver from the course, no matter the cost. \n\n“Captain, the crew will starve!” Balthazar pleaded.\n\n“Oh ho, don’t worry”, Striggan chuckled, “I’ll be eating just fine. Now get outta mah sight and back to work!” Striggan slammed his fist onto his desk and ordered them out of his quarters. Everyone returned to their regular business, Lydian began playing a tune on her flute. Balthazar began his plotting. Striggan would have to go. He may not have been the nicest guy himself, but any captain who treated his crew as tools rather than allies was a failure of a captain in his opinion. Mordecai could tell from the look on his face that Balthazar was planning something. Perhaps they could work together? He approached Balthazar with a question:\n\n“Planning a mutiny?” Balthazar and Mordecai were never particularly close. In fact, Mordecai wasn’t close to anybody on the ship. He prefered to spend most of his time alone up in the crow’s nest. Mordecai was such a loner that Balthazar had trouble trusting him.\n\n“I don’t feel like I need to tell you, anything.” Balthazar said smugly. Mordecai walked away annoyed, and resumed his position at the crow’s nest. Balthazar walked over to Rikza and struck up conversation with him. Rikza and Balthazar had gotten to know each other during their time on the Sentinel, and weren’t exactly friends, but he trusted Rikza a bit more than he did Mordecai. Under hushed tones they learned that neither of them were very happy with the way Striggan had been running things. They decide to work together to bring him down. At the mention of mutiny, Lydian misses a note on her flute and swiftly attempts to regain her composure. Rikza and Balthazar took no notice, and continued on. \n\n“What did you have in mind?” Rikza asked Balthazar. \n\n“Well, taking down the Captain himself is going to be a task in it’s own right. First, we need to do something about his first and second mates. I’ll leave the First Mate to your… expertise.”\n\n“You think I can take Barnaby down on my own?” Rikza said incredulously. He was a bit flattered that there was so much faith placed in him, but still dumbfounded at the prospect of the mighty Orc being downed by him alone.\n\n“I’m sure you can find a way, Rik. Now if you’ll excuse me, I’m gonna go have a talk with the chef.” Balthazar began walking downstairs towards the kitchen, having to hide the sly smile curling on his lips. He walked into the kitchen to the smell of delicious morsels cooking and the sound of rapid chopping. In the middle of the kitchen was Jareec, cheerfully preparing food as usual. The Orcish chef spotted his visitor out of the corner of his eye and turned to greet him.\n\n“Balthazar! Ay mon! C’mon in! What can Jareec do for ya today?” Jareec had always been so chipper and upbeat, especially while cooking. Balthazar liked that. He was probably the only person on this ship who wasn’t an asshole in some way or another. \n\n“Heh, well Jareec I don’t need much. Just wanted to ask ye a question.” Balthazar was taking a huge risk here. But a mission like this required such risk. \n\n“Ask away mon! Jareec is happy to help!” The cook kept up at his work at an impressive pace, chopping vegetables at a breakneck pace.\n\n“Well… what do you think about the Captain?” Jareec immediately froze in place. His cleaver let out one final ‘chop’ as it landed on the cutting board. Jareec stayed absolutely silent for a few seconds before slowly and awkwardly regaining himself.\n\n“H-heh, w-whaddaya mean?”\n\n“You know what I mean, Jareec. Striggan is a tyrant and I want you to help us take him down. You won’t have to get blood on your hands, we just need you to slip something into his next meal.”\n\n“L-look mon, de Captain has always been good to me, y’know? I don’t tink I could…”\n\n“Think, Jareec. Really think. Has the Captain really been good to you? Has he been good to any of us? For that matter, has it never struck you as odd how a majority of his hand-picked henchmen are Orcs just like you? I’m willing to bet that he thinks of your people as big dumb brutes, only tools to reach his goals. I bet that’s how he sees all of us! But imagine if I were Captain instead! I would treat my crew fairly! I would never let us go days without eating like he has!” Balthazar’s words struck Jareec hard. Perhaps there was some truth to them.\n\n“What do ya want me to put in de Captain’s food? I don’t have any poisons y’know.”\n\n“Well, there’s a lifetime supply of rabid rat meat down in the storage room. I imagine if you sneak some of that into his food, the Captain will be feeling that in his guts for a few days, haha!” \n\n“Alrighty mon, I’ll see what I can do…”\n\n“Thanks Jareec, I knew I could trust you.” And with that, Balthazar took his leave from the kitchen.\n ",

        "text": "Cast of Characters:\n* Kevin: DM\n* Me: Gnome Bard named Coraim\n* James: Elf Sorcerer named Lexter\n* Liam: Half Elf Rogue named Vido, nicknamed Redrum\n\nWe met in a rundown tavern, drinking our ale, and we overheard some people talking about finding something. I asked them about it and they said there was a cave they were going to go to, but they couldn't get in, and offered to hire us to go there, we would get the treasure, but give them the credit. The barkeep overheard us talking and told us to get out because he wouldn't have mercenary dealings in his tavern, so I offered to play lute at the tavern for free for the night (I'd get tips though) in return for not getting thrown out. I played for a few hours and had a good performance, but not many people frequented the bar, so not many saw the performance. The barkeep offered to give us a free room for the night because of the favor, which we gladly accepted before eating dinner and drinking some ale (Vido ordered an entire bottle of mead and got totally wasted). On the way up to our room a floorboard collapsed under Lexter, making him fall for 1 HP, which is quite a bit for a Lvl 1 sorcerer, but we were about to sleep so it didn't really matter. When we got to the room there was a rat there, which I tried to pick up as one of my goals is to find a small animal, adopt it, name it Leonard and have it be my faithful companion. I failed to grab it though, but then Vido easily picked it up and immediately threw it at Lexter, who was already not having a very good day. Lexter made a reflex save... and rolled a 1, so the rat went in his mouth, he was able to get it out but it was a terrible experience nonetheless. The next morning we set out for the cave, my character composed a short song about the route called \"Long Dusty Road\", which the group immediately ordered me to stop singing (and yes, I was actually singing it). Along the road we saw a gnoll, but the DM described it instead of telling us it was a gnoll, reasoning our characters might have never seen a gnoll, and we all told him to stop as he has done this before (once even with orcs, which everyone knows of course). The gnoll attacked me, bringing me down to 3 HP, when it came to my turn I did what is now my signature move, 5 ft. step back and crossbow bolt to the face, and I got a critical. The bolt, instead of going into his head like usual, blew it completely off Fallout VATS critical style. We later got to the cave and found some kobolds, one of which Vido also critted with his crossbow, this time instead of just exploding it's head, exploding it's entire body.\n\nTL;DR Rock out then throw a rat in someone's mouth then blow up a few baddies, while wasted.",

        "text": "[On a tiny little planetoid whipping through the upper atmosphere of a fantasy bullshit world](https://redd.it/4bfele), weird things are happening. A shapeshifter is having an identity crisis. A man's eyes are exploding. Magic is running wild. A wolf made of ice is talking about the weather with an elderly gnome. And the party has decided to ditch their local authority figure to go out, well, partying.\n\nThis was a bigger deal than it sounds like. The party in this case consists of [Jello Shot the huge-sized cannon-weilding slime](http://i.imgur.com/oNuhhTF.gif), [Mister Nibbit the axe-happy dullahan](http://i.imgur.com/yLyg2W3.png), and [Loki the smooth-talking half-elf](http://i.imgur.com/LFK6CyZ.png). None of these people could be called, by any stretch of the word, \"responsible\". Jello had a habit eating the scenery, and people's shoes, and people. Nibbit would murder anyone named Lawrence, and generally acted like a toddler hopped up on sugar. And Loki... Loki was a con man who hit on any woman he came accross, and had deep-seated daddy issues. All of this was reigned in by the fourth and final party member, Ling Ling the monkey girl ranger, who was not terribly good at combat or at talking, but always kept the party on-track and not doing anything suicidal.\n\nAnd Loki was planning a little outing without her supervision. Sure, the other two party members were basically sociopathic toddlers with deadly weapons (or, you know, [regular toddlers](http://forward.com/opinion/176043/more-killed-by-toddlers-than-terrorists-in-us/)), but they could be reigned in by promises of food, shiny things, cannonballs, and Lawrences. Plus, Loki had a simple job lined up! An old contact of his was putting out word for some ~~disposable~~ able-bodied adventurers to go raid generic dungeon #71823, for which there would be a handsome reward. And without Ling Ling there to whine about \"funding the criminal underworld\", \"murdering sentient creatures in their homes for cash\" and \"wanton property damage\", all those pesky moral dillemas could be safely ignored in the name of sweet loot.\n\nLoki had no idea what he was fucking with.\n\nThe party arrived on the scene, which was some sort of old mine, and started the chucklefucking way early. The wooden pallisade around the mine was, for whatever reason, occupied by a flock of multicolored birds. Nibbit saw them, and immediately rolled intimidate \"to establish dominance\". Natural 20. And that's how Nibbit got his own personal flock of birds living inside his armor. Loki, already rolling his eyes at the party's antics, politely knocked on the wooden gate to the mine. Then Jello Shot ate the gate.\n\nOnce inside, they met their marvelous employer, [Spinebreaker the orcish archmage](http://fav.me/d5ssr9p), and her personal fan club. Which is where things REALLY started to go off the rails. See, Spinebreaker was friendly enough, and knew Loki by reputation, and was even willing to pay the party for their services. The trouble arose from the fact that Nibbit was, well, Nibbit. And there were a few strange features of Nibbit's backstory. For starters, although he had seemingly just wandered out of a junkyard, he had been specifically created for a purpose. Some sort of shadowy afterlife council of assholes had gone to the trouble of binding Nibbit's soul into that suit of armor, and they had given him a very important mission: TO KILL THE ORCISH ARCHMAGE. And to ensure that he followed through, they'd also granted him the services of a summonable spirit (Nibbit was technically a summoner, with some woobly bits and no spellcasting). And now, that spirit was screaming in Nibbit's empty skull- \"THAT'S HER, KILL HER, KILL HER NOW!\"\n\nNibbit was not one to refuse such a command, especially one that involved cold-blooded murder, so he promptly charged up to the party's unsuspecting employer and swung his giant fuckoff axe. However, Spinebreaker was no fool, and [swapped herself out for an illusory double](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/m/mislead) at the last moment. Nibbit, not one to give up on an idea, promptly attempted to hack this illusion to pieces while screaming incoherently. It was ineffective. Jello Shot, not one to leave his best buddy high and dry, promptly pitched in by rushing forward and holding *the illusion* at cannonpoint, in order to scare the real Spinebreaker out of hiding. For some reason, this proved ineffective.\n\nNeedless to say, Spinebreaker the absurdly powerful orcish archmage was not terribly impressed with the party. She informed Loki that if he did not reign in his rabid dogs, she would personally turn them into radioactive vapor. Loki hastily stepped in, getting Jello Shot to put away his cannon, and desperately promising Mister Nibbit that he would \"Get him a spinebreaker\". Thanks to the magic of a natural 20, Nibbit reluctantly stepped down, and the plot continued.\n\nSee, Spinebreaker was a powerful spellcaster. A VERY powerful spellcaster. And, in addition to that, she had a whole fanclub of other spellcasters, who were half apprentices and half personal servants. But, for some strange reason, the weird ruins within the mines put a lock on her powers and brought her back down to normalhood. Her servants weren't affected by this strange ruin, but they WERE affected by the various guardians patrolling it, which presumably tore them to pieces. If all the screams were any indication. They quickly decided to STOP sending people into this horrible deathtrap, as no amount of lives was worth Spinebreaker's curiosity as to what was down there. Or, no amount of her fan club's lives. Mercenaries, though? Risking life and limb was literally their job! So hey, party, go clean out this hilariously dangerous dungeon and I'll give you a big sack o' cash!\n\nThe party insisted on having a guide to this little shindig, someone to make sure they didn't get lost in the mines. By random chance, they chose the only person in Spinebreaker's employ with a name and a personality. He was Roak, a tall, well-built fellow who was straighforward and had no sense of humor. He also moved exclusively in straight lines, at ninety degree angles. What a character! They basically dragged him along, made him show the party where the ruins were, then out of sight of the rest of the fanclub, held him at cannonpoint and forced him to go in with the party as extra muscle. Needless to say, Roak was not terribly fond of the party, either.\n\nThe 'ruins' that the party explored had a bit of a [familiar flavor](https://redd.it/48jeer) to them, except that they were rather well-maintained, shiny-looking, and not full of malfunctioning constructs. Nope, this place was instead full of FULLY FUNCTIONING ATTACK GOLEMS, WHO SEE YOU AND ARE TRYING TO KILL YOU ROLL INITIATIVE\n\nWhat followed was a hard fight with some seriously tough opponents. Golems didn't have great AC, but they had damage reduction, and a very annoying immunity to magic. Nibbit hit them with his axe a lot, but was nearly killed in the ensuing melee. Roak the press-ganged NPC helped out with a big old greatsword, but mostly managed to get his own shit slapped. Loki could outsneak the mechanical bastards any day of the week, but he was still rather squishy and preferred NOT to get hit by a fist with the size and velocity of a runaway boulder. That left Jello Shot. Only about a third of the golems could actually hurt Jello Shot, but his AC was so pitifully low that he couldn't dodge any attacks. But, as a counterpoint, HE HAD A FUTHERMUCKING SEIGE CANNON AND ACCESS TO THE TRUE STRIKE SPELL. So the fight with the golems went like a game of Rocket Tag, except that one side had infinite ammo, and the other side had homing rockets. And when Jello Shot finally ran out of true strikes, it was up to Loki to save the day by sneaking up to one of the golems and shoving a stun baton into its neck. Everyone would have been more impressed if that wasn't the first and only significant contribution Loki had made in the battle. They glared at his full hit points and grumbled some stuff to the effect of \"pansy-ass\" before moving on to actually search the area.\n\nThe area turned out to be a massive warehouse, littered with strange metal boxes. Upon prying open those boxes, they found hundreds upon THOUSANDS of [Pearls of Power](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/m-p/pearl-of-power). And each and every one of them was burnt out. Power gone. Pfft. Worthless. Luckily, the party managed to find a shipping manifest nearby, which neatly catalogued all the stuff that was in each box. And while most of it was Pearls of Power (now burnt out), there were other things in there as well. Some things called Mana Crystals, assembly kits for various security golems, an automatous repair bot, and the assembly kit for one [Gargoyle Guardian](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/constructs/guardian-gargoyle), enhanced edition.\n\nThe party immediately set to plundering anything of value that they could from the boxes, and even found and activated the repair bot (which looked and acted exactly like [Codsworth](http://i.imgur.com/64gZm9l.png) from fallout) so that it could patch up Mister Nibbit. But upon finding the manual for the Gargoyle Guardian, and realizing that they hadn't fought it yet by virtue of still being alive, they decided three things.\n\n* Let's not tangle with the robot that has more hit dice than all of us combined while low on HP.\n\n* Let's call in some backup, while we're at it.\n\n* And hey, while we rest, we might as well [RTFM](http://i.imgur.com/vV7OF5H.jpg).\n\nThey sent the very annoyed Roak back up to get some assistance from Spinebreaker's fan club, while Nibbit set to work repairing himself and Jello Shot searched EVERYWHERE for some stuff to eat. Seriously, modern facilities are the worst, the only thing you can find large quantities is PAPER. Freaking PAPER. It's like trying to feed an elephant with popcorn. Loki, meanwhile, bedded down in a nice portable sleeping bag while paging through the mind-numbing assembly instructions of a highly intricate magical golem. But finally, he found what he was looking for- the way to activate the golem's Command Mode, where it would be receptive to new instructions and cease acting on its own initiative. Jackpot.\n\nThe party threw open the big, sinister doors to the last part of the dungeon (having heard nothing from Roak, and figuring it was now or never). Inside, they found a strange staircase flanked by big, important-looking magical wiring and a perfectly still Gargoyle Guardian. Nibbit promptly decided to STICK HIS HANDS IN THE LIVE WIRES, FOR SCIENCE! This nearly killed him. Again. And as a consequence, a weird magical effect activated and Nibbit shot underground, tunneling around like [Bugs Bunny](http://i.imgur.com/jIV0QUN.jpg). Loki and Jello Shot wisely decided not to screw with the wires. Instead, they advanced toward the waiting Gargoyle, who activated as soon as they got near enough. Gargoyle shuddered up, and in a cold robotic voice, demanded that the party leave IMMEDIATELY or be torn into very small pieces. So Loki took his chance and screamed out the Konami Code, and Gargoyle immediately relaxed, waiting for commands.\n\nOf course, it wasn't THAT easy. Gargoyle was still inclined to act on his previous orders (IE: Don't let anyone unauthorized into the room behind Gargoyle) and did not recognize the party as \"administrators\". Loki tried to use a familiar line of bullshit that had worked on another golem (\"You've been abandoned, we own you now\"), but sadly this didn't work. Gargoyle was insistent that he had only ONE boss, who hadn't been around for a while, but had left specific instructions that there were no other admins, and NOBODY who isn't an admin is allowed into the room. All the while, Nibbit was playing a retarded game of chicken with Gargoyle, trying to \"sneak\" around him underground while Gargoyle tracked his location and cut him off whenever he got too close. When Nibbit finally pushed his luck too far, Gargoyle slammed his fist underground, grabbed Nibbit by the waist, and threw him full force across the room. Nibbit didn't have shit on Gargoyle. Which pissed Nibbit right the fuck off. He readied his axe and prepared to charge, when Jello Shot had a brilliant idea. He grabbed Nibbit, held him steady, and slammed a cannonball into Nibbit's face.\n\n[Nibbit was okay with this.](http://i.imgur.com/hQGnJ1C.png) He calmed down soon after.\n\nJello Shot then took the lead in negotiations with Gargoyle. Using Loki as a proxy, he asked Gargoyle how he recognized his Admin. Gargoyle responded, not with an appearance or a password, but by the Admin's incredible magical signature. Jello Shot, being good at recognizing powerful magic auras, tapped into the magic running through the wires and tried to spoof the powerful magic signature.\n\nNatural. Twenty.\n\nGargoyle immediately recognized Jello Shot's authority, which Jello Shot promptly used to make admin accounts for the entire party (save Nibbit). Then they started asking for information. Why was Gargoyle here? What was he guarding?\n\n&gt; GARGOYLE: \"This room contains the Atmospheric Attractor. Clarification: The Atmospheric Attractor ensures that there is air on the planet.\"\n\n&gt; LOKI: \"FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU- **NIBBIT STOP TUNNELING UNDER THE GODSDAMNED GARGOYLE! WE'RE LEAVING, NOW!**\"\n\nWith that, Loki grabbed everyone and ran as fast as he could for the exit before his two little murderbuddies decided to end all life, everywhere, for shits and giggles. On the way out, they ran into ANOTHER adventuring party, which was sent down because Loki &amp; pals were gone so long they were presumed dead. After clearing THAT up, they returned to the surface to have a word with Spinebreaker.\n\n&gt; LOKI: \"So, we cleared out the facility, mostly. Lots of interesting stuff. And golems. We killed most of the golems, so it's safe to go in. But not that big ominous door. DO NOT GO INTO THE BIG OMINOUS DOOR, BECAUSE CERTAIN DEATH LIES WITHIN. Also, what the hell happened to our backup? Where's Roak?\"\n\n&gt; SPINEBREAKER: \"Backup? We haven't seen Roak anywhere. But the facility is safe now?\"\n\n&gt; LOKI: \"Yep. Except for that big ominous door. Which you should never enter. Ever. Seriously. Don't. Can we have our money now?\"\n\n&gt; SPINEBREAKER: \"Your suit of armor is making a very spirited attempt to kill me.\"\n\n&gt; LOKI: \"But I talked him down-\"\n\n&gt; SPINEBREAKER: \"I mean RIGHT NOW.\"\n\n&gt; NIBBIT: \"***DIIIIIIIIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!***\" (Swinging axe angrily through her illusory ankles)\n\n&gt; LOKI: \"Uh. Can we just have our money and go?\"\n\n&gt; SPINEBREAKER: \"Fine, but if I ever see armor again, I kill him. Understand?\"\n\n&gt; LOKI: \"Yup! Certainly! LET'S GO GUYS.\"\n\n&gt; JELLO SHOT: \"I can help Nibbit find Spinebreaker.\"\n\n&gt; LOKI: \"How about **NO**, *NOW GET MOVING*.\"\n\nThe party returned from their adventure, richer in both gold and perspective. Well, except for Nibbit, who was still ranting angrily about not being allowed to kill ANYTHING. Loki immediately found Ling Ling, and profusely apologized for all the trouble he had ever caused her, and thanked her for all her hard work keeping the party from killing themselves.\n\nLoki vowed on the spot never to take command ever again. While he was doing this, Jello Shot ate his shoes.\n\n[NEXT EPISODE!](https://redd.it/4drkwc)",

        "text": "Heya all! I've been thinking whether or not to share the story of my first D&amp;D campaign on here for a while, and at the behest of some friends, have decided to at least test the waters! \n\nThis is the story of a campaign I and 4 (at first) other friends started. There was a campaign we were doing before this, but things didn't exactly take off on that end. Long story short, we decided to let a different one of us DM and start a new campaign. Our former DM, (whom we'll refer to as Stan) wanted to do an Evil campaign. By Evil campaign, he wanted us to roll Evil McBadperson characters that were OP right off the bat. This idea wasn't very popular with the rest of the party, so we settled on pirates, more or less. The campaign takes place on Faerun of the Forgotten Realms, mainly on the Swordcoast. We start off on 3.5 but transition to 5e around the 10th session. Allow me to introduce you to our crew, and a brief look at their stories before the campaign!\n\n* Balthazar Stormrider \n\nA Human Swashbuckler who grew up orphaned in the Nelenthar Isles. After washing up on the Isles at a very young age he did everything he could to survive. As he grew he became entranced with the lifestyle of the nobles who lived in the far off mainland he would read about, and more and more repulsed by the barbaric fighting styles of the Orcs and the bestial Minotaurs who made up a majority of the Isle's populace. In his late teens he is sold as a slave laborer to the captain of a smuggling ship. Despite the circumstances of their meeting, the captain becomes a father figure to Balthazar and the young man becomes a fairly capable sword fighter and sailor under his tutelage. One night, a mighty storm takes the lives of the entire crew while the ship is at sea. Except for Balthazar. Balthazar guides the ship back to Nelenthar, where he becomes a local legend due to his remarkable feat. A few years later he is hired to join the crew of a man named Captain Striggan on yet another smuggling ship, the Sentinel.\n\n* Rikza \n\nA Drow Rogue, Rikza was born in the Underdark and grew up there for a chunk of his childhood. He left the Underdark when his royal house was killed and he was enslaved. After spending some time as a slave, he killed his primary master and then fled to the surface. He was looking for another life and maybe a new family. However, due to his Drow heritage he was never truly accepted by anyone on the surface. The only business he could find was with shady underground crime syndicates. Eventually he wanted to leave that behind as well, leading him to join the crew of the Sentinel, lead by Captain Striggan. It was aboard here that he was treated as an equal and finally felt like the fact that he was a Drow didn't matter. He felt like he could finally have a real family aboard this ship.\n\n* Lydian\n\nA Halfling Bard who was Enslaved by Gnomes and forced to work in what can only be called Gnomish sweatshops. (Author's Note: It was at this point that I realized most of our backstories involved enslavement.) While working as a slave she befriended a fellow slave named Aria, who became her mentor. Aria taught Lydian much in the way of musics and legends, which allowed her to develop into a talented Bard herself. Tragedy struck though after their Gnomish captors executed Aria for causing \"unrest\" with her songs. After escaping her Gnomish captors she had to fend for herself to survive, making special use of her silver tongue and honeyed words. Eventually, she came to the Sentinel and was added to her crew. Her experience as a Gnome slave has left some deep-seated hatred for Gnomes in her heart.\n\n* Mordecai - the Half-Drow Ranger who never leaves the crow's nest\n\nNow, this was Stan's character. Sadly, he insisted on his character being the biggest enigma of the group and refused to share his backstory with the rest of us. He even neglected to mention race even though it later becomes painfully obvious what he is. He insisted on being an edgelord who rarely left his position at the crow's nest. We eventually have a sort of falling out with Stan, causing his character to be more or less retconned from the story and replaced with a different character. But for as long as he was part of the party, his character will appear in the story!\n\n* Vivian\n\nA human Sorceress. She was a member of the military for a time. Her brothers and sisters in arms did not see value in her magical talent. They instead only saw her as a weak little girl who couldn't swing a blade worth a damn. This lead them to mock her and ridicule her, even though she had done nothing but use her magic to save their sorry asses time and time again. When her platoon was slaughtered, she was blamed for it. For being weak, for not being able to take up a blade in their defense. She fled the military and found her way aboard the Sentinel.\n\nVivian comes in later in the story as the replacement for Mordecai.\n\n* Sheldon\n\nNot an original part of the crew on the Sentinel, this Dwarven Shieldmaster joined the party after being \"coerced\" by the crew to join them during an excursion in the city of Waterdeep! After his childhood home burned down and his parents were murdered, he grew up in the slums of Waterdeep's poverty-stricken lower town. His preferred method of fighting is using a shield in each hand and bludgeoning his opponents into submission and blocking any hits that may be going for him or his non-consensual comrades.\n\n* Airabella\n\nAirabella is a Pixie who accompanies Sheldon on his misadventures. She acts as the brains to Sheldon's pure brawn, and is typically viewed as his better half. They met one day as Sheldon got lost trying to find his way to the party's destination in Waterdeep. She had attempted to pickpocket him but instead got stuck in his pockets. She overheard what the party had planned in Waterdeep and decided to join them on their escapade. After verbally abusing Sheldon for being dumb enough to get lost of course.\n\n* Ismael\n\nIsmael is of a race of cat-people. He operates as a Rogue and Spellthief. He's typically up to no good and eventually gets himself locked up in the Waterdeep jail. It was here that he shares a cell with Balthazar Stormrider. The two become fast friends and plot a breakout. Ismael would go on to become Balthazar's first made aboard his newly acquired ship.\n\n\n\nSo there it is! That's the cast of this story, this truly bizarre adventure! If this sounds like something you guys would like to hear more about let me know! I have plenty more to tell. If this is well-received I'll start uploading the story in full sessions!\n\nEDIT: Looking at the responses this got, the first part of this story will be up tomorrow (3/25/2016)!\n\nEDIT2: Part 1 of the story is up! https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/4bzdf2/balthazars_bizarre_adventure_session_1_part_12/",

        "text": "**The continued tale of Malaney Belrue.** [Click here for previous chapter.](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/4ah47f/dnd_5e_great_bouts_of_change_pt_3/)\n\n ✻   ✻   ✻   ✻   ✻\n\n\nDid I mention that this day keeps getting better and better? I don’t even know where to start with all that has happened since Bordel spoke with me. The pain in my stomach that forms as I recall how horribly wrong everything went...\n\nBahamut returned to us a few hours later. He instructed us to follow Him. We were lead right to His treasury. It’s no lie the wealth a dragon can hord. The room held thousands upon thousands of the finest armor, weapons, art and precious gems. He then instructed us to take a single item. \n\nMy party walked about the room with giddiness that was beyond me. I did not feel worthy to take from Bahamut. Knowing my heart and the bitterness I held toward Heironious, it seemed hardly fair that I partake of such generosity.\n\nHowever, Bahamut must have predicted my reluctance. He had a jade box brought out to me. Inside it was what I’m going to call a Lyro Blade. It is a lyre, a bow, and a sword. When I first pulled it out, I was admiring the strings in their individual colors; gold, silver, copper, brass, and bronze. I doubt I would have known it was a sword until Bahamut instructed me to pluck the silver string.\n\nThe blade extended out from the joint that connected the bow to the instrument. I could feel my arm grow weak as I looked at the blade. Surely He did not expect me to fight? I AM NOT A FIGHTER!!! Yet, the Platinum Dragon gave me the only weapon I could possibly ever conceive to use.\n\nBahamut encouraged me to give the sword a try. I swung the blade around in a grandiose ‘En Garde!’ type of motion, feeling embarrassed by my naivety. But it was in that movement that a strange sound rippled through the air. I looked intently at the sword and gave it a small swirl. A ringing echoed from it as it moved. It was one of the purest sounds I have ever heard. I kept moving the blade, listening to the depth of notes that came out. The Dragon had to remind me not to get too carried away with it. I quickly regained my composure and thanked the Deity for the gift.\n\nNext came our individual counsel with Bahamut, the Dragon starting with me. He took me to His gardens. It was the most peaceful place. The various flowers in bloom and the pool of water in which a waterfall cascaded into was breathtaking. I would have been very content to have remained there. That’s how I envision my future home; in a place of peace and beauty.\n\nIt took me a moment to remember what it was I wanted to ask, but the gist of the questions and answers asked and given is this:\n\n**How did we manage to all find each other?**\nAs Primordials, we are naturally drawn together.\n    \n**Do we have to stay together?**\nYes, unless we want to fight off the evils alone.\n    \n**How am I to fulfill my duties of Balance?**\nLike magic, I will learn how to harness the deific energies inside me.\n    \n**Are my parents Primordials?**\nNo. We choose the life we want every time we manifest as mortals.\n    \n**What do you know of my father’s death?**\nHe had found one of the cups and the Order knew.\n\nHowever, He didn’t explicitly answer the last question, but Bahamut did say I would learn more through obtaining my father’s journal.\n\nShortly thereafter, I had to leave the gardens. With reluctance I returned to my companions. Yet in those moments I had to ponder, a resolve came over me. I was to remain with my party and needed to learn how to use my weapon, or at least how to defend myself. At the moment, Kimaris was with Bahamut and so I asked Fern, Oda, and Bordel if any of them would help.\n\nThe Halfling was more than eager to give me pointers. As she went on, instructing me on how to hold the bow, notching an arrow, and releasing the bowstring (without the projectile in place), Kimaris had returned. I’m not sure how long he had been there, but he marched right over to me and Fern, asking if he could see my weapon.\n\nKimaris held the Lyro Blade to his eyes, observing the sword and strings. Soon he handed it back, mentioning, “It’s pretty, kinda like you.”\n\n“Thanks,” I said curtly. I wasn’t sure what the boy was up to. He had earlier whispered in my ear to inquire about the rose he had given me weeks ago. With the teasing and disrespect Kimaris has shown me since his transformation, it seemed out of character. Surely the kid doesn’t have a soft side.\n\nAnyways, Kimaris went and sat down, observing the two of us. A few minutes of that and he began to gloat about how he would one day be stronger than all of us. He had the gall to tack on that he’d be able to kill us all. Kimaris then attempted to soften the blow by saying how it was his duty though to protect us.\n\n“It’ll be a drag, but someone’s got to do it,” the boy finished.\n\nMy patience was lost, and like an idiot, allowed Kimaris to get under my skin. As he said the last sentence, I dry fired my bow and asked, “Why are you even here then? If you’re so great, why waste your time on us?”\n\nIt did little to humble him. Rather Kimaris was amused and continued to goad me on all too well. Undeterred by my questions he berated me with insults like sheep, noodle back, and princess. \n\n“I am not a princess,” I told him, “I have more backbone than you know!”\n\n“No you don’t. Now stop pouting,” Kimaris responded. \n\n“You know not where I come from! Stop being so cocky! If you’re suppose to protect us, do so with honor!” I hurled, unwilling to let the boy have the last word. But quickly we both were scolded. Bordel had returned, and it’s hard to say if I would have acted differently if I had realized he was there. \n\nFrom behind me came the words, “Will you two stop!” I jumped and whipped around to face the man. He strode over and with an angry look said to Kimaris, “I’d expect as much from you.” A smile had barely crept on my lips in triumph, thinking Bordel had sided with me, but like water vaporizing in the fire, my smile vanished as he looked me in the eyes.\n\n“But from you!? Shame!”\n\nThe phrase ‘knife to the heart’ was more applicable than I can express. The sharpness of Bordel’s words and the pain that rippled through my chest was quite terrible. I barely muttered an apology before walking away.\n\nHeavens I feel so ashamed. I did then and I still do now. And it only got worse. After sitting near Oda, enjoying his quiet company, the next round of insults ensued as follows:\n\n“Like her!? Why would I like a noodle girl like her!?” Kimaris stated. I had to wonder how many more knives I could take, but nevertheless I hugged my legs all the tighter. “You hear that noodle girl? You’re A-NOY-ING!” I still didn’t respond. “Tell us. Why are you still hear?”\n\n“Because I’m a sheep, Tolaj Yaæ,” my tongue slipped.\n\n“What undercommon is that?” I refused to indulge him on his naivety to the Godly language. That was a mark against him. Still, Kimaris couldn’t let whatever his issue was with me go. \n\n“Besides, aren’t you curious how your dad died?”\n\nIt’s enough to say my head snapped to attention. “How would you know,” I said slow and direct. Fern warned that I likely wasn’t ready for such news.\n\n“Oh she needs to know. It’s probably what she ran away from anyways to come with us, right?” he asked me, tagging on, “Coward.”\n\nI found my feet and walked over to Kimaris with such hatred. Whatever composure I tried to keep fled. My tears poured and with every energy of my being spat at Kimaris, “I RAN FROM PERSECUTION YOU ARROGANT BOY!”\n\nFern grabbed my arm, snapping my sanity back. She inquired from whom I was running from, I barely whispering, “My family.” The Halfling tried questioning more about it, but Kimaris was with us and demanded I draw my weapon.\n\n“She’s in no state to fight!” Fern scolded.\n\n“Now is the perfect time for her to learn!” the boy retorted. Hating the high emotions I was exhibiting in front of everyone, I politely declined and reminded all whose house we stood in. I caught Bordel looking at me from the corner of my eye and once more apologized to everyone.\nI was about to withdraw myself when something blunt and hard thrusted into my diaphragm. Momentarily I was doubled over Kimaris’s knee. With no breath left in me, I crumpled to the floor. Bordel’s voice rented the air as he stopped the boy from hurting me further. And to make the situation worse, Bahamut gave His words of disappointment.\n\nWe were allowed to remain long enough to agree on our next course of action. Seeing that we were to collect the cups, I informed the groups about my father’s journals. Getting them would prove a challenge, but I was willing to try. If anything, I wanted to see what it was Bahamut wouldn’t tell me about my father’s death.\n\nWith a wave of His hands, light enshrouding us once more, we found ourselves on a familiar road. We were much further from Ruebis than I thought we’d be, but with it being early evening, I was less convinced of being able to make town before the gates closed.\n\nAnd so, camp is ‘made.’ Oda, Fern, and Bordel have gone off hunting leaving me alone with Kimaris. With emotions still high, I went off a little into the woods, the camp within sight. I’ll be honest, I’ve sat a spell as I recounted this day. Every pause I’d look over at Kimaris and feel the hate flood through me. About the third time I had a small epiphany.\n\n* I can’t allow Kimaris to keep getting under my skin. I’m stuck with him for eternity.\n* I can’t keep being helpless! Surely there ought to be a day I can defend myself. And,\n* What if I ask Kimaris to teach me to fight?\n\nI’ve wasted enough time writing while the others have been gone. I worry I am being a fool by making this attempt with the boy, but at least I can honestly say I’ve tried, if it fails.\n\n\n✻   ✻   ✻   ✻   ✻",

Silence spell took care of his casting, and an Enlarged Brawler negated his full-round attacks by grappling him every round.  Dragon fights and dies in near total silence. \n\nNext room has a trogdolyte with class levels.  Whoops!  Crit.  Dead.  Also in the room: a captive friend, who tells us four pieces of information:\n\n1. The demiplane we're in has time running faster than the Prime Material. \n2. The guy who captured her is a wizard.\n3. The guy who captured her is on top of the tower.\n4. The guy who captured her has a keystone that gives unfettered access to this accelerated-time demiplane.\n\nNeat.\n\nRather than just open the door and Kool-Aid-Man our way to the bossfight like we usually do, we decided that tactics might be in order.  A few minutes later, our group is invisible, silenced, and ignoring difficult terrain through flight and our Enlarged Brawler's Pretty Pretty Pink Slippers of Ignoring Difficult Terrain.  We use these to bypass the remaining encounter on the way to the bossfight, where the wizard boss is studying an orrery on top of the tower.  Roll initiative.

        "text": "I'm not really sure what voice I want to write this in so forgive me if it's not to your liking.\n\nI suppose the first thing I'll do is describe my survivors in a few sentences. Eva is tall, blonde, and athletic with a friendly face and personality. She used to be a swimmer and now works in computers for a large corporation. Joey is an aspiring politician who also trains in several martial arts, including boxing and Brazilian jiujitsu. Jazmine and Blake are a couple and look like they belong together. Jazmine is a waifish actress who is shy at introduction but friendly after initial acquaintances. Blake is a personable guy with a slight Californian accent who is pursuing a masters in computer science.\n\nThe Grey have been here for weeks. They have earned our trust by sharing their technology and advanced medicine. They have provided tours of their exploration ships and have greeted humanity's leaders with grace and beneficence. These cordial relations have culminated in a worldwide ceremony of unification. Alien leaders will meet with human governors all over the planet at events that attract crowds resembling those of Woodstock.\n\nEva, Joey, Blake, and Jazmine are in attendance at such an event in Houston, Texas.  The group had just loaded up on overpriced water from a concession stand when a man in a overlarge hoodie shoves past Blake and Jazmine and separates their previously held hands. Jazmine makes to rebuke the aggressor but falls silent as it turns back and snarls at her with inhumanly edged teeth. She gasps in response and attempts to relay to her friends the unnatural lavender tone to the man's skin. She tries in vain to point the fanged assailant out in the crowd as it makes its way through the throng of people at alarming speed. Jazmine stares in wonder as the unknown man reaches the barrier separating the crowd from the stage where the mayor and governor are seated. To her horror, she watches as the  creature jumps the barrier and clambers on the stage, leaving several slumped security guards in its wake. Without warning the hooded figure detonates itself creating a huge fireball, vaporizing the stage and the first several rows of people. \n\nThe group of friends are thrown to the ground when the shockwave reaches them. The crowd erupts in horror and the clamor reaches a fever pitch as concentrated automatic weapons fire explodes from within the crowd. Jazmine notices that several more of the odd hooded figures have appeared among the people and are firing indiscriminately at the fleeing masses. Almost in unison Joey and Blake exclaim their desire to leave and make a dash for the car, which is several blocks away. \n\nThe group tries in vain to stay together though they are eventually separated as large, frantic man bars their way. Without warning Eva grabs a metal folding chair and plows through the man, barreling him over and leaving the group stunned. As Eva advances aggressively through the crowd, using her chair as a battering ram,  the survivors lose sight of each other. \n\nBlake eventually makes his way out of the park and back into the city. He is close enough to the parking lot that he can actually see his car. As he rounds the block he is confronted by a hooded figure with lavender skin and glinting claws instead of fingers. Before he can react the creature lashes out and slashes Blake’s arm, splattering bright red blood across the pavement. The effort has removed the creature’s hood to reveal a bald, almost bulbous head. The assailant makes the finish Blake with a slash to his neck but misses as he is dragged from behind into an office building. The alien makes to follow but automatic weapons fire stops it in its tracks. The creature’s chest explodes as several rounds find their mark. Without looking to see who has saved his life Blake reaches for his pocket knife and attempts to stab the creature in the face while it is down and injured. Miraculously the alien is still alive and well enough to slither out of the way. Blake’s knife becomes lodged into the ground and the alien kicks him in the face, knocking him to his side. As this is happening, Joey runs by and is so distracted at seeing Blake and the alien that he trips over his feet and falls to the ground. At this point the creature has gotten to its haunches and attempts to escape. Blake’s unknown savior fires at the evading figure and misses several times. \n\nJoey gets back to his feet, gives chase, and barrels into the creature from behind. With a series of sickening thuds Joey takes the creature’s head and smashes it into the pavement until it stops moving. \n\nThe plain clothed soldier who saved Blake’s life offers bandages and a warning to get out of Houston before disappearing back into the city. Joey is able to pull a cell phone and a Uzi, automatic pistol from the alien.\n\n\nJazmine finds herself separated completely from her group and utterly immersed in the panicked crowd. She makes her way from cover to cover attempting to avoid the now raging firefight between plain clothed human soldiers and the hooded aliens. She has reached the edge of the park and makes to cross the four line side street.  Before she darts from cover she is stopped in her tracks as a alien troop transport lands 50 yards in front of her and begins disgorging biomechanically armored alien soldiers. Ten of the hulking, multi-limbed aliens make it out of the ship before an errant RPG finds its way into the bowels of the ship and destroys it. The surviving aliens concentrate their fire on the surrounding civilians and mow down many people. They are only stopped as uniformed soldiers arriving in humvees and technicals provide cover fire for the escaping citizens. Jazmine uses this opportunity to leave the park and make her way to the group’s car.\n\nEva and Jazmine are the first to arrive in the parking lot but cannot gain entry into Blake’s locked Charger. Eva decides to try her hand at hotwiring a nearby motorcycle and much to the irritation of the game master, somehow translates her knowledge of computers into a successful hotwiring attempt. Eva and Jazmine hop on the chopper and get about a foot before remembering they don’t know how to drive a bike and stall the engine out.  \n\nAt this moment Joey and Blake arrive and everyone piles into the car. A panicked man and his family appear in front of the vehicle and plead with Blake for admittance. He politely refuses the man, who in turn becomes aggressive and tries prying at the door handle. Joey flashes his Uzi and threatens the man who reluctantly backs away from the Charger. \n\nAs the group is arguing about their next move the sky above Houston turns a sickly orange as the atmosphere catches fire. A tear in space the size of city gives birth to a gargantuan vessel of equal size. \n\nThe group watches as the lumbering craft settles over downtown and ejects an unearthly green spike into the heart of the city. The green flash of plasma precedes a mushroom cloud and thermal shock wave that instantly incinerates everything within a five mile radius. \n\nThe group winces as the glass in the Charger is blown out and the vehicle is shoved several feet away from the blast before everything goes dark. \n",

        "text": "The Legend of the Van Kurgians\nThis was one of my first D&amp;D campaigns, I was playing with my dad and some of his friends at the tender young age of 11 and 1/2. We had just finished up a Marvel Superhero campaign using the much forgotten Marvel Card Role-playing system (That's a story for another time) and I was eager to get in a fantasy game (Willow was one of my favorite movies at the time)\n\nAll of the other players decided they wanted to play a family of adventurers, and it was settled that we would be a party of paladins (We didn't tell the DM). And so, the Van Kurgian family was born. Each  player had a different way of playing a paladin, and each character ended up being kind of holy-crusader. We had a tough but fair older brother who valued giving second chances, a kind but naive sister, a holy crusader who would not tolerate any shred of wrongdoing, the black sheep brother who left the order to seek his fortune, and myself, who was the doe-eyed knight in training who had yet to see much of the world. \n\nNaturally conflict started right away, The Fortune seeker often found himself at odds with the values of rest of the party (stealing or taking liberties with justice himself), and the crusader often went out of his way to punish sleights so small that it seemed irrational. The rest of us did our best to keep them in line, often times we're able to redirect their attention before things got too bad (As I recall there was one close miss where the crusader was EXTREMELY close to catching, and lashing a street urchin who stole some fruit.). Except the time we didn't. \n\nWe were defending a town from Orcish takeover. Our duties had us stationed there for a week, training, fortifying and arming the villagers as best we could before the ravaging hoards. The night of the raid came, and the battle was fierce. Many villagers died, and the party was split up in the middle of the battle. \n\nAt this point I'd like to take a small aside to explain a feature that the DM had integrated into our campaign -- Every once in awhile, when the party was split up, or the party was sleeping he would split the group into two groups in different rooms. Often times he'd time it so food came right when this happened so one group could eat and chat while the other took care of the whatever role-playing side business they had. Often times it was communion with our deity (this was important in our particular campaign) or side missions(info gathering, small jobs when the team split up)\n\nWhen the battle was through, the Fortune seeker, and the Crusader were missing. We went searching for them, and found their tracks leading outside of the city, into the forest. After we patched up the villagers and made sure they were going to be okay without us for a little while we followed them. What we found was truly gruesome, The crusader of the group had nailed and flayed the Fortune seeker to a giant tree and was shouting scripture at his now limp body. \n\nWe quickly subdued our overzealous brother, and quickly determined figured out that he had become evil through detect evil. We assumed it was a magic ring that we had acquired on our way to the town, and we didn't have the occasion to cast that particular spell in that time. We laid our fallen brother to rest, and brought our straying brother back to our order. The Van Kurgians were never the same after that, We went on a few more adventures, but soon after with the families moral so low, the rest of the family succumbed to a inconsequential encounter, to some wizard who’s plans weren’t large or grand; And so the legend of the Van Kurgian family ended with a whimper on the underside of an arcane boot. \n",

        "text": "Welcome back to the crazy-ass stories of that hanging little planetoid, the rainy comet! Previously, [our intrepid party had just fought off a goddamned army of tengu](https://redd.it/48sr0c), against all expectations.\n\nThey needed to capitalize on this victory. So they focused down on one of the serious magical artifacts that had been in possession of the enemy general- one suit of exteremely swanky Celestial Armor. Given that gravity in this place didn't always point at the ground, the party was VERY INTERESTED in 'acquiring' some more items that would allow them to fly. And they were in luck! The enemy general (who was incredibly embarressed about being captured) freely told the party where he had gotten his set- he'd stolen it from the pompous humans who lived on the top of the planet.\n\n&gt; \"So, guys, who wants to go and piss off the largest, most dickish faction on the entire planet in pursuit of cool shit?\"\n\nThe party, consisting of Jello the slime, Ling Ling the monkey ranger, Nibbit the dullahan, and Loki the half-elven rogue made preparations for battle (and looting). And as part of this preparation, Loki met up with some poker friends, and started up a conversation with an ornery four-armed giant named Nodagog. With the promise of new sights, as well as things to punch, Nodagog agreed to tag along.\n\nThey departed, spring in their step and cash in their minds, and soon arrived at a fringe town which would be their staging area for the daring caravan raid they would soon be conducting. While there, Jello ate the local scenery, Nibbit angrily asked people if their names were Lawrence, and Ling Ling went with Loki to actually accomplish the mission. Between them, they gathered info about where the caravan would be going, how it would be guarded, and what it would contain. But even that wasn't enough. In order to give themselves a real edge, Loki called in some favors and got the party into the local black market.\n\nWhile there, Jello ate the local library, Nibbit angrily asked people if their names were Lawrence, and Ling Ling went with Loki to actually accomplish the mission. This would become a trend. But in addition to all the terrible tools they bought for their upcoming raid, they also stumbled upon something rather distressing- the local animal poachers had brought in a live hippogriff that was going a bit nuts after being continuously abused. Ling Ling took issue with this, and approached the [sleazy owner](http://i.imgur.com/n4jnbS9.jpg) to give him a piece of her mind. When the owner indignantly insisted that he knew what he was doing, and who was this little girl to ask, Ling Ling challenged him to a bet. If she could wrangle the hippogriff without an entire team of men wielding nets and cattle prods, she would officially own it. And if she failed, well... she'd probably be dead. The owner agreed, content in the knowledge that the hippogriff was rabid and uncontrollable, and that the outcome was sure to be amusing.\n\nLing Ling, with the help of Jello Shot's library binge, stepped up to the task. All of the wranglers were shouted away, and she stepped up- alone and unarmed- to treat the poor hippogriff with respect and kindness. After about a three-minute staredown, which was dead silent and filled with various people sweating buckets, the hippogriff acknowledged this show of kindness a slight bow and NOT disemboweling the girl on the spot. Which meant that the party [had a shiny new hippogriff](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/ranger/archetypes/paizo---ranger-archetypes/sky-stalker)! When the former owner got all pissy about \"cheating\", Loki stepped up behind him and nat 20 kicked him in the balls. After that, they wisely decided to leave.\n\nFinally, once they had pulled Nodagog out of a very shouty discussion of philosophy, the party set their trap for the swag caravan. Snares were set, bows were readied, people were put in place, and Nibbit was given very firm instructions not to run screaming at people waving his axe like an idiot (effective as that might be). But alas, on the arrival of the caravan, it turns out that the guards weren't stupid- they'd immediately caught on to the first set of traps, and were actively seeking out the ambush. So the party gave it to them.\n\nNow, this is the part where things get silly. Specifically, in regards to Jello Shot the slime. See, he was a Magus by class, and adept at both spellcraft and smacking shit. In particular, he had the strength and the size to lift very heavy objects, cast True Strike, and then lay down the hurt on stuff in his way. In addition to all this, he'd been detecting some strange stuff. Namely, a very nearby source of magical energy that was host to an incredible amount of raw, unrefined power. So, given that the plan was quickly going south, Jello Shot grabbed a rock the size of a car, tapped into the magic energy, and cast True Strike.\n\nNow, see, what True Strike normally does is makes it so that your attacks have a very good chance of hitting. And that was certainly the case here. It's just that True Strike didn't usually set the attack on fire, and make it glow with the force of a miniature sun. The boulder slammed into the caravan's spellcaster, instantly turning him into a diffuse butt of meat-vapor. That just left a stupid-looking paladin and a creepy kid.\n\nThe kid immediately darted into some nearby foliage, while the paladin rushed into a confrontation with Nodagog the four-armed giant (who was a monk). The paladin emerged victorious, scoring an unfair number of crits, and Nodagog was forced to withdraw. Loki, meanwhile, assisted from a distance with ranged sneak attacks, and Ling Ling kept the party acting cohesively with screamed orders and the occasional arrow. Soon enough, the paladin was hurled off a nearby cliff, and that just left the creepy kid.\n\nThe kid who bursted from hiding and hit Jello Shot with some sort of incredibly caustic explosive, blasting him unconscious and nearly killing him. Loki proceeded to have a staredown with the knife-weilding little fucker with the vacant expression, before they charged eachother and Loki did just enough damage to knock the kid down. Ling Ling and Nibbit furiously tried to revive the fallen Jello Shot, and they succeeded bare moments before he permanently died. The party gathered up around the KO'd kid, wondering what the fuck was going on with him, when Loki stepped too close and the kid sprang up and went directly for the throat. Loki dodged back just in time, and Jello Shot promptly descended upon the little fucker and beat him to death with a boulder. They weren't taking any chances this time.\n\nWith that, the party had full access to the contents of the caravan- most of it in the form of weapons and armor! Sadly, the party had promised most of it to some shady underworld types that they didn't want to piss off, but they still had first pick of the good stuff. And as luck would have it, they found several more sets of slightly-less-impressive celestial armor, as well as a collection of seige engines.\n\nAnd that's when things got really silly.\n\nSee, a seige weapon is basically a Huge-sized variant of a normal weapon. Like a ballista, which is just a Huge crossbow. Jello Shot was huge-sized, so he could potentially use one of them... if it weren't for the fact that he had no means of using it and he dissolved organic material on touch. But then, he saw it. The love of his life. *The seige cannon.* Being made of stone and metal, having an incredibly simple firing mechanism, and being an appropriately-sized firearm for the massive Jello Shot, he finally had the weapon he had spent his whole life fantasizing about. Everything else was secondary. He had a portable 6d6 of pure HURT.\n\nWith looting successful, the party high-fived, sold off all the stuff they didn't need, and walked straight into the rather battered Paladin who was still somehow alive. The party didn't really want to kill him, because he was just so stalwart and upstanding, but also pathetic and not about to withstand 6d6 points of Shiny New Cannon to the face. After some deliberation, they decided not to kill him where he stood or let him go, but instead capture him and put him in the care of Nodagog.\n\nThe heroes, everyone! Petty bandits and occasional slavers! Whatever, the humans probably deserved it, right?\n\n[NEXT EPISODE!](https://redd.it/4bta8c)",
