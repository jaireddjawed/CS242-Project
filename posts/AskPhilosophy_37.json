        "text": "ME:\n\nPlease, simulate to me a dialogue between Kant and Thomas Reid, arguing with each other about the best way to refute idealism and skepticism.\n\nAI:\n\nKant: \"Idealism and skepticism are misguided because they rely on the subjective experience of the individual rather than objective reality. The mind imposes its own structures on the world, but this does not mean that the world does not exist independently of our perception of it. The only way to truly refute idealism and skepticism is to appeal to the concept of the noumenal world, which is the world as it exists in itself, beyond our perception of it.\"\n\nThomas Reid: \"I disagree with your reliance on the concept of the noumenal world. It is impossible for us to have any knowledge of a world that exists beyond our perception, so it is more reasonable to base our understanding of reality on the immediate experiences and common sense of everyday life. We can observe the world and draw conclusions based on the regularities and patterns that we see, rather than relying on abstract metaphysical concepts.\"\n\nKant: \"But common sense and everyday experience are also subjective, and can be influenced by our individual biases and preconceptions. The noumenal world offers a way to ground our understanding of reality in something more objective and universal. By appeal to the concepts of space and time, we can come to a more certain understanding of the world as it exists independently of our perceptions.\"\n\nThomas Reid: \"I agree that subjectivity can be a problem, but I think it is better to acknowledge and address this subjectivity rather than trying to ignore it. In any case, I am not convinced that the concept of the noumenal world is a useful or meaningful way to understand reality. It seems to me to be more of a theoretical construct than anything else.\"\n\nKant: \"I understand your reservations, but I believe that the concept of the noumenal world is a necessary part of our understanding of the world. Without it, we are left with only the subjective experiences of the individual, which are prone to error and misunderstanding. The noumenal world offers a way to ground our knowledge in something more certain and objective.\"\n\nThomas Reid: \"While I understand your desire for certainty and objectivity, I am not convinced that the noumenal world is the best way to achieve it. It seems to me that this concept introduces more problems than it solves. For example, how do we know that the noumenal world exists, and how do we know what it is like? I think it is more reasonable to rely on the direct evidence of our senses and the patterns and regularities that we observe in the world, rather than relying on abstract metaphysical concepts.\"\n\nKant: \"I agree that our senses and observations are important sources of knowledge, but they are not the only ones. The concept of the noumenal world helps us to understand the limits of our knowledge and the ways in which our mind structures the world. It also allows us to go beyond the mere appearances of things and to understand the underlying reality. Without the concept of the noumenal world, we are left with only subjective experiences and no way to ground our knowledge in something more certain.\"\n\nThomas Reid: \"I understand your argument, but I still think that the concept of the noumenal world is unnecessary and introduces more problems than it solves. It seems to me that it is more reasonable to rely on our senses and the patterns and regularities that we observe in the world, rather than relying on abstract metaphysical concepts that we have no way of verifying.\"\n\nKant: \"I understand your point of view, but I still think that the concept of the noumenal world is an important part of our understanding of the world. It helps us to go beyond the mere appearances of things and to understand the underlying reality. It also allows us to understand the limits of our knowledge and the ways in which our mind structures the world.

The problem is that nowadays we have a better understanding of human nature and behaviour for a psychiatric, psychologic, biologic etc. Point of view. Most of those philosofies that base their lifes in ascetism, most of the times go against human behavioural patterns themselves. And we actually find that oppressing the primal needs of humans, causes serious psychological damage (basically living in an artificial society like ours). \n\nDon't you believe that those philosophies are actually just another way of self-indoctrination that will just cause the same damage as any other indoctrination? And if not, how do you actually apply those philosophies in your daily life? How do you go against the biological needs? Which is the best way to introduce that kind of philosophy, for it to be successful and useful?",

        "text": "Suppose John tosses a coin and thinks his mind can cause it to land on heads. He tosses the coin and it lands on heads 10 straight times. Suppose, for the sake of this example, that the coin couldn’t have been rigged, or that its probability is extremely low, say 1 in 10^50. I am now tasked with figuring out whether his mind affected the result or whether it was chance. Personally, I would not believe it. The reason I wouldn’t is because I sort of imagine previous trials. I imagine that in human history, people must have tossed millions of coins. It is not surprising that eventually, atleast one person would land a coin on heads 10 times. Note that in this case this isn’t exactly analogous to the inverse gambler’s fallacy. The inverse gambler’s fallacy suggests that previous trials must have occurred because a rare event occurred. But this isn’t what I’m suggesting. I am not proposing that previous trials must have existed BECAUSE this rare event occurred. I am using my reasonable knowledge of previous trials having occurred to instead infer that this rare event shouldn’t be that surprising. \n\nIs this reasoning sound? And what here can be considered a previous trial in the first place? For example, imagine I created a new kind of coin. This coin had special attributes and was a type of coin that never existed before, but yet still, could only land on heads or tails. If John now landed this coin on heads 10 times, my intuition/mind mat not consider previous trials of coins (which are of a different type) as relevant. This type of coin in my head after all had not been tossed before. What if instead of a coin, it was a different object, and yet produced one of two results with a 50% chance, and John instead “tossed” that object? Does this make a difference? \n\nMy general question is twofold if any of this sounds confusing: a) should previous trials affect whether or not one thinks the current trial is produced by chance?  b) what constitutes as previous trials? How “similar” must the previous trials be as an event to the current trial to be counted? What should this similarity be based on?",

No. \n\nDid you feel obligated to say that? No. \n\nDid you feel obligated to say that? Yes. \n\nI have a hunch I'm wrong-- but I'm very confused. As it stands, all of these phrases can still be *true*. But I was told that in the last statement, the response 'yes' -- invalidates the first two statements. To my understanding, the question do you mind if I read aloud and the first, 'did you feel obliged to say that (answered with a 'no'--)? are connected, but the third question refers only to the second question-- and the obligation felt to answer the second question regardless of the answer. I understand that it doesn't make sense to answer the same question with two different answers-- but I see it more as a progression and want to understand why I'm wrong. \n\nI see it as being similar to this line of questioning:\n\nDo you like me? No. \n\nDid you feel obliged to say that? No. \n\nDid you feel obliged to say that? Yes. \n\nIt may be a faulty understanding, too, on my part of what truths can be included in a logical progression-- as feeling obligated and whether one minds or not can be a hard truth/fact. If the question were about hard facts, then it would become somewhat clearer to me. \n\nIs the stove on? No. \n\nIs that true? No. \n\nIs that true? Yes. \n\nSo --  it follows then that the stove would, in fact, be on and that I lied by saying the stove was off, and then I'm confirming that I lied that it was off?  Thus by that logic-- when applied to my first example (if it can be), the first one would be wrong, and I would, in fact, mind if someone read aloud? \n\nAnyways-- I've overthought this way too much, but I wanted to see what you all had to say so someone can save me from myself and possibly explain how they view it.

        "text": "There's a lot of evidence that Morality (as a system) has massive evolutionary benefits for humans (as a group and thus also individually). Humans who follow a moral codex can live more peacefully and successfully as a group. Having any set of rules for a peaceful coexistence is basically a necessity when bigger groups of humans live together or interact.\n\nAll of this applies regardless of whether morality is real (=exists objectively, independent of humans) or not. Even \"making up\" a moral system (like making up culture or anything else) is a highly successful evolutionary strategy. Morality being real or not has no impact on this because ultimately there is no way to determine which moral rule is the right/real/objective one. To put it differently: in an atheistic world, there is no evolutionary benefit to following the \"right\" morality. Some moral rules might generally be more evolutionarily successful (do not kill), but that is again irrespective of whether they \"really exist\".\n\nIf you take this view seriously, it becomes hard to believe that morals really exist. They were just developed by humans culturally (with a biological foundation) because there was an evolutionary advantage.\n\nNow one of the most common arguments for moral realism will be brought up in response to this: mathematical rules. Didn't humans also evolve to understand them? And aren't they still real? But there's a major difference here. Following moral rules as a group is evolutionarily beneficial regardless of whether they are real or not (see above). But the same doesn't apply to (some/many) mathematical rules: mathematical rules allow deductions about the outside world, which are often necessary for survival (how many apples are left to eat etc). \n\nIn short: there's an evolutionary incentive to make up a moral system to organize peaceful coexistence regardless of whether morals are real or not. Similar to any other aspect of culture (dances, singing, art...). For maths, there's an evolutionary incentive to understand the real world around us.",

For these purposes, we'll say that he has the Omni attributes to the greatest extent logically possible (to avoid the \"create a stone so heavy he can't lift it\" paradox).\n\nI'll start with a small and hopefully relatable analogy.\n\nSteve was driving down a one lane road, stuck driving behind another car with no chance to overtake the other car. Steve is upset at the driver in front of him because the driver keeps significantly slowing down every 100m or so. \"This guy is a total jerk!!\" Steve thinks to himself, \"he's just doing this to mess with me. He's slowing down a bunch knowing I can't pass him. What a total jerk, just being mean to me because he can and there's nothing I can do about it!\" \n\nWhat Steve doesn't know is that the driver is looking at the street signs, trying to find his destination. The driver is slowing down at each intersection to read the sign. The driver isn't doing this to be mean. He isn't a jerk. He's got a perfectly good reason for his behavior. Steve isn't aware of this so he assumes the other driver is a jerk. In reality, that driver wasn't a jerk. He was acting in a way that even Steve would've found entirely reasonable if he knew about it.\n\nThat's us. We are Steve. We see the awful suffering like tsunamis and malaria and bone cancer. And we assume that the if there is a god in charge of this, he must be a total jerk for behaving this way (allowing it). However, if we knew more, we might find this behavior totally reasonable. We can say that from our perspective, god is a jerk. But from his much larger and well informed perspective, he's behaving in a reasonable and loving way.\n\nDoes this effectively address the problem of evil/suffering? I know there's no way that I'm the first person to propose this explanation, but I'm not sure how to go about finding rebuttals to my position.",

But whenever I want to move, my soul commands my body to do so, and whenever my body is affected by the material world, my soul perceives that through the senses. But if my soul is immaterial, hoe could I see or hear with it? And if my body is material, how could it possibly be caused by an incorporeal being, like the soul, to move?

Historical research suggests that my 9th Great Grandfather was called John Cant, born in South Queensferry, Scotland; he would have been contemporaneous with Immanuel Kant’s possible grandfather, Hans Kant.\n\nWhen I started investigating the ideas of Immanuel Kant, I didn’t like them much.  I think that guy ascribed too much emphasis on imaginary and divine authority.  I don’t like how he thought that some kind of karma would be returned to us in an afterlife if we obeyed the orders of our ancestors.\n\nA cat has recently adopted me and she seems very intelligent.  Immanuel Kant does not appear to have considered animals to have capacity for rational thought, which I now absolutely dispute.  I currently feel quite certain that this particular cat (I call her “Tini” sometimes, but if I’m speaking to her directly I say “Meow”) is eminently capable of exquisitely manipulating the minds of humans.  My cousin in NZ agrees that cats can have capacity for rational thought.\n\nWhen I search for opinions of Immanuel Kant on the rationality of animals, I found this quote:\n“Animals... are there merely as a means to an end.  That end is man”. Whereas, I also found this quote: “He who is cruel to animals becomes hard also in his dealings with men. We can judge the heart of a man by his treatment of animals.”\n\nWhat opinions did other dead philosophers have about the rationality of animals?  Did any of them actually have relationships with animals (meaning caring for each other; not having sex with each other)?",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/zssar5/what_philosophy_can_say_about_my_theory_of_how/",
        "text": "My theory of how to stop Russian-Ukrainian war (theory + tale). \n\n\\--------\n\nThis post have been removed from  communities related to Ukraine, Russia, Europe, USA. It was trashed on  Ukraine community and then blocked.\n\nBut you guys, philosophers, are open minded beasts that can look on the uncomfortable truth if there any.\n\nThanks :-)\n\n\\-----\n\nHello, I have weird theory of how can be stopped Ukraine-Russian war.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTheory in short:\n\n1) Let's assume that there some equilibrium between good and bad in this world. You can't do good without somewhere will be something bad.\n\n2) It is very easy to check this theory if you try to do only good things and avoid bad things, avoid harm to others.\n\n3) I have 9 years of my life tried, to get myself to something better, but always have avoided harm others. I stuck. I can't get out from my personal pit. All progress that I had in some years, fade away by same amount of regres next year.\n\n4) Ukraine want better life, everyone wants this, but why again we have that, this cause war, and slow regress of Russia? Why everyone so proud of Ukraine, only now, when Ukraine fighting with Russia (monster)?\n\n5) Why we always have this polar world, where is rich countries, good countries, poor countries and bad countries? Why our all bisness build on \"heroes and a monsters\", \"competitiveness, where some win, other die, fade away\"?\n\n6) You all know that without opposite poles you can't get electricity. And all know that it is wise to get lot of small batteries, connected, than one but very big that can explode.\n\n7) So, when Ukraine decided to get to better life, we have increase of bright side. But this cause that dark side (Russia) must protect itself, it attacked. Reasons from both sides why this all happened is unimportant, important that this all happening, again fight because something whant to get higher, and something don't want to fall down. And why should someone fall down when you getting up.\n\n8) So to get to better situation, we need next. We must try as hard as we can to get there. But in no way, that this will take something from others, to not harm others.\n\n9) Ukraine must refuse to go to Nato, otherwise increase of bright side, will do increase of dark side, no matter what. Ukraine must move to better situation economically, and in safety, but in no way, that cause that Russia begin again protect itself, or that it begin to fall.\n\n10) We must reject polar world, and move to more even distribution of good and bad. Other things we'll get from collaboration. We must accept presence of some amount of darkness in world, if we want same amount of something good. No one should suffer because of progress of other, everyone should bear own price + collaboration.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo addition to this some fictional story. What higher is numb theory, what below - feeling upon it.\n\n1) At some time there was boy and girl, they love each other, because we know that different poles attract.\n\n2) At some point boy moved to big city, girl stayed in village. But they wrote letters to each other.\n\n3) Boy was really strong and become bright and strong man, trully bright side. He killed alot of monsters.\n\n4) At some point there was no letter from girl, and when man get to the willage he saw that all is dark, and place where they used to play, there big, dark red castle. Then he found out that there is a monster in that casle.\n\n5) One more thing, such happened that man have some error in his head, so he have two sides inside, man\\_1, a hero. Man\\_2 his conscious part.\n\n6) Everything became clear, monster took his love one, so he went to red castle. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8asioti6pM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8asioti6pM)\n\n7) So he entered inside and started ferocious fight. He moved floor after floor, and wanted to get to top of castle and kill main monster. Man\\_1 was so happy because of this, but Man\\_2 felt that something is wrong. So Man\\_2 persuaded Man\\_1 to wait a little. Man have 2 other friends, so he call them. But here something trully scary. All friends have had same situation, that all went to safe their love because the monsters in their willages.\n\n8) Scary was not this. Friend one, kill main monster and then become monster by himself. Friend two, not become a monster after the win, but he committed suicide, and his last worlds was \"why after win of the main monster, all I want to do is harm to other, and why if I avoid this, I am empty inside\". Third friend, after win could not get from the castle, he was saing that he will not let evil with him outside, he still there alone.\n\n9) So man (his part man\\_1 and man\\_2), get to last big door, behind which they heard truly scary noices. Main monster is there. Man\\_1 is rushing to battle, but man\\_2 know that something is truly wrong. All friends get here and all ended badly, and all did not found their love live in castle.\n\n10) So man\\_2 did unthinkable, he stand near the last door and sad \"I will not let you there, do whatever you want, search for a princess but you will not kill last monster\".\n\n11) This was a betray, they started hard fight. During a fight they went down level by level and ended up in a very deep dungeon, in the pit. During this fall all other monsters become live again.\n\n12) And here we have, man\\_2 droved man\\_1 near the endge of chasm. One more push and he will fall. Man\\_2 stop and they both sit near to it. Man\\_1 during this fight lost all his strenght, become week, his bright fade away. He sat near the edge, and sad to man\\_2: \"You liar, you traitor. How could you do something like this. We was almost near the exit. Why you did this all to me.\"\n\n13) Man\\_2 felt also horrible, but he knew that there is no real exit from the castle like man\\_1 wanted. Then they heard same noises as near the door to main monster. They stared into the darkness. Man\\_1 said: \"see what you have done, now we will be killed both because of you, and we will not safe a princess\".\n\n14) Monster get closer and close to them, man\\_2 was truly a brave one and stood near the man\\_1 in a wait of a monster. But then all what they saw, what came from a dark, is so beautiful girl, that nothing in whole world have such a beauty. [https://youtu.be/fxt96kIwoWA](https://youtu.be/fxt96kIwoWA)\n\n15) Man\\_1 recognised love of his all life in her, his lovely heart. So man asked where is all monsters, why you havent been killed, and where she was all the time.\n\n16) Girl said, that after man left willage, and started to becoming a hero, she fell sick. She started to loose control over herself, and then she not remember anything. And then at some point she found herself at the top of the castle, behing big door. And there was no any monsters when she get from top to here.\n\n17) Also, man remembered that during one fight hi wound main monster left arm. Girl have shown her left arm and there was big scar there.\n\n18) Then man\\_1 and man\\_2 understood, that all what thay tried to kill was this beautifull girl, that become a monster when man become too bright (please listen next music till the end). [https://youtu.be/OxQcNLo4bUI](https://youtu.be/OxQcNLo4bUI)\n\n19) This completely destroyed man\\_1, he fell near the pit crying and said: \"What I am a monster that turn other to monsterts to become a hero\". [https://youtu.be/gbl5oaqJbbE](https://youtu.be/gbl5oaqJbbE)\n\n20) He looked on his friend man\\_2 and said - if you hadn't stop me, I would have killed love of my life. [https://youtu.be/zl1AGynlFQo](https://youtu.be/zl1AGynlFQo)\n\n20) Man\\_1 prolong: \"I have had kill myself after this, or went insane, or all have lost all the feelings and become empty\".\n\n21) This pain matured man\\_1. He now want to get from castle, get to better life, but he said that he will not get from here without his girl, without as it turned out - dark side. [https://youtu.be/fit55LFxhHY](https://youtu.be/fit55LFxhHY)\n\n22) And this what is meant when you have a friend that can go against you, to safe you from yourself. The End. [https://youtu.be/xgSYa0pMuWY](https://youtu.be/xgSYa0pMuWY)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStory and all music made by me, from scratch.\n\nMy real face here - [https://youtu.be/fWi\\_aYke4iI](https://youtu.be/fWi_aYke4iI)\n\nI am from Ukraine, western part.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf this all is really property of this world, please help me with this. Repost and get this to leaders of both involved parts. Ukraine, Russia, USA, Nato and Europe. I have had tried to do this by myself, but I get only ignore.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe must stop war, because of compassion to others. We must stop it because compassion to our bright and dark sides. If what above is true, and we not do anything, then we are truly a monsters, and belive me we will not reach stars in such a way. Because this system will not let monster outside.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you :-)",

Others, like Bradley and Feit, seem to have refined this view to be that death is bad only insofar as it would deprive you of goods you otherwise would have enjoyed, but not if it deprived you of evils you otherwise would have endured. Thus, the death of someone in constant, incurable pain and suffering is not nearly as bad as the death of a young person at the prime of their life. \n\nHowever, Bradley and Feit seem to assume that the non-existent person has a wellbeing level, that we can compare with their possible wellbeing level at some world/time where they had not died. To expand on this, Bradley and Feit presume there are states that obtain for a subject at a time when that subject does not exist, and therefore their basic values, such as wellbeing, will all be zero. But what if states do not obtain for the deceased, because that dead person is no longer a subject at a time when they do not exist.\n\nIs this assumption valid? Do the dead have a wellbeing level of zero?",

        "text": "There seems to be a paradox in my head when it comes to evaluating independent probabilities and it's sort of boggling my head. I am curious as to how to solve it.\n\nSuppose I tell my friend to think of a number between 1 to 100,000 and I try to guess it every day. Suppose I fail for 100,000 straight day. Today, I guess it correctly. I claim that I predicted this using mind powers. A skeptic says, \"You guessed 100,000 times! You were bound to get it right! The probability of you getting a correct guess out of 100,000+ guesses is pretty high\". Now, that same day, Jane asks her friend to think of a number between 1 and 100,000 and tries guessing it. She guesses it correctly. People are astonished. After all, she guessed it correctly. Even the skeptic starts believing her.\n\nYet today, the probability of me guessing the correct number and her guessing the correct number were the exact same. Why should we care about my previous trials? After some thinking in my head, it seems that I, and possibly others, incorporate my previous trials since they are similar. But why does similarity matter as long as the guesses are happening on independent days. If say, instead of me guessing every day the last 100,000, a new and different person did. Then, we perhaps would be just as surprised that I guessed it today as we would with Jane. But what really is the evidential difference here?",

So imagine on a really small level since there are all these self contained interactions you are metaphorically warping your own little bubble in space time like a large mass, but instead your not, yet your senses filter and combine the stimmuli throughout your life and it gets projected to whatever part of the mind is aware and tries to make it as relative to the path of your body throughout its space time. \n\nBecause your body is no different that a large gravitational mass except you are less measurable but your brain is making and storing measurements all the time and the combination of those measurements that just so happen to occur in the brain created “relative” or “subjective” experience.",

He says:\n\n\"Mathematics is a study which, when we start from its most familiar portions, may be pursued in either of two opposite directions: The more familiar direction is constructive, towards gradually increasing complexity: from integers to fractions, real numbers, complex numbers; from addition and multiplication to differentiation and integration, and on to higher mathematics. The other direction, which is less familiar, proceeds, by analysing, to greater and greater abstractness and logical simplicity; instead of asking what can be defined and deduced from what is assumed to begin with, we ask instead what more general ideas and principles can be found, in terms of which what was our starting-point can be defined or deduced.\"\n\nWhat does he mean by \"we ask instead what more general ideas and principles can be found, in terms of which what was our starting-point can be defined or deduced. \"? He calls this second approach mathematical philosophy and the first approach regular math. It seems like this part in quotes is misworded. Does he mean mathematical philosophy tries to come up with different axioms then those used in regular math, or that it tries to come up with different conclusions than regular math by using the same axioms? Examples of what he means would be helpful. \n\nThanks!",

It means we, as humans, control our destinies and all of our good acts are from the heart of the individual.

I read \"What is it Like to be a Bat?\" and I just... don't get it. Nagel seems to be saying that bat's have conscious experiences, which are subjective, and are vastly different from our own. We cannot precisely know what those are or what they are like, even if we can watch every neuron in the bat's brain fire as they experience those things. I just don't see how the upshot here is that the conscious experience is somehow something other than neurons (or some other physical phenomenon). You are reading this and experiencing some sort of subjective state as you do. But they idea that this state is somehow not a product of things physically happening in your brain makes no sense to me, this seems like a massive leap.   \nAnother argument, about Mary in the colorless world, seems similarly contrived to me. Sure, Mary could know what the brain does when it sees red without ever seeing red and sure, she may learn something new when she sees red for the first time, but that doesn't make that knowledge any less dependent upon neurons/a physical state. \n\nBut I know these essays are classic and that a lot of very intelligent people refrain from adopting physicalism because of these arguments; I conclude that I just must be misunderstanding or missing something critical.\n\nThanks y'all!",

I can go along with these similar creatures being grouped together as Loxodonta or elephants.\n\nMy question is: Other than the convenience of using a group word, do group words actually refer to anything but a linguistic convenience or a scientific classification. We use such words as if they do refer to something - \"Hey, look at the elephant.\"  Yes, there is an animal (another universal) with such &amp; such characteristics, but is it an elephant? Or is the word \"elephant\" a language construct which we impose on individuals to understand &amp; control our perceptual world? Is the word \"elephant\" a concept in our heads with has no external reality?

I heard it was hard, thus I did not read it, but it was mentioned so much in The Guide For The Perplexed that I decided to read it. I have been reading it for a few days, currently have read the first 3 books, and I can barely ( when I can) understand what he is trying to say. I have had no trouble read any of the books stated above, but using the same methods of studying I can't understand much in Metaphysics by Aristotle. Book 1 and 2 were mostly understandable, but Book 3 is where most of the problems arise for me. The main problem is that Aristotle seems to not lay out the basics, but immediately jump to the complexities. What he is saying just doesn't make sense to me, I can't give any examples, sorry, but those who have read the book may know what I mean. Does it get any better later? Am I too stupid for metaphysics? As Maimonides says, the masses should not learn metaphysics. Did I only read easy books and should I stop learning philosophy and theology?",

Sometimes i feel like humanity is getting more nihilistic, is it wrong for me to feel that humanity might even collapse on itself due to lack of understanding of life and even finding meaning to everyone? I imagine that humanity might undergo this process and have two outcomes: a collapse or a ''spiritual'' revolution, with people getting on their trails again.

Therefore, it probably didn't happen by chance. The defender of the chance hypothesis might say \"Well, both Joe's and Jane's events were guesses. The probability of atleast one guess being correct out of 1,000,005 guesses isn't that low.\" In this case, even though the events seem more dissimilar compared to the rigged lotteries case, the defender incorporates those trials. \n\nThis begs the question: when can we incorporate other trials? How similar can other trials be? And is similarity an objective property? Can it be said to be objectively true that the event of the New Jersey lottery occurring on Oct 8th and the New Jersey Lottery occurring on November 10th are more similar to each other than the events of Joe and Jane guessing a number? Why or why not?\n\nWhat about the naturalness of certain categories? For example, suppose Adam thinks of Jane and Jane calls her. You might put this event into the category \"thinking of someone and calling you\". Because tons of people have thought of someone and they didn't call, you might rationalize it's not that surprising. \n\nBut what if say you invent some new game where you write down a word of five letters and ask another person in front of you to write it down as well. And they match. The probability of this happening by chance is of course very low. The defender of the chance hypothesis can again try the strategy of putting this into a category of events to increase the probability. But which category does this belong to if this game has not been played before? If it hasn't been played before, does this make this event more impressive than the event of you thinking of someone and having them call you?",
