        "text": "I used to work for a high profile luxury floral shop in a big city so I have many many stories to tell. \n\nBut one common thing we would deal with is people checking in not even an hour after the delivery time “Have the flowers been delivered? They haven’t called to thank me, so clearly they haven’t gotten them yet.” I would explain to them that they have been delivered, but the person is probably busy may not have even seen the flowers yet and will thank them when they have time. \n\nFor most people this gets them to calm down, but there would always be the people who would not take that answer and think we are lying to them, delivered to the wrong person, etc. Usually I would just send proof of delivery to the person and get them off the phone/out of the store. \n\nBut one day I decided to have some fun. “I’m sorry, let’s get this fixed. I think reaching out to them to ensure they got the flowers is the best solution here. I don’t want to make you deal with this, do you have the better number to reach Ms. Rose directly (not real name but) we only have her work number?” \n\nI already had Ms. Roses personal number though, because she was also one of my clients. I knew she really did not like us calling it because she’s a busy woman and asked us to only call her work number and only communicate with her assistants. I knew very well she was going to be angry if I called. But I also knew I could shift that anger to someone else this time. \n\n“Hello, Ms Rose. I’m sorry to bother you but Ms. Orchid wanted me to double check you got the flowers she sent you. I know you asked us to not call this number but Ms. orchid gave us this number and was very adamant that we spoke to you directly” \n\nI’m not sure exactly what followed. But given the tone Ms Rose had as she said she will handle it from here, and given I never saw any more flower orders from Ms Orchid to Ms Rose. I think it’s safe to say their conversation did not go well.",

        "text": "I work in a small startup team that, even before going public or even having a website, makes million dollar deals due to connections the CEOs have. I get less than normal wage for my position as an average analyst.\n\nWe had a meeting yesterday with one of these public companies, and my CEO asked one of the company guys when they were taking Christmas break. \n\nThe reply was \"Oh, we're a small company, so we don't really take a break, you know? We do what we gotta do.\"\n\nWhich only goes to prop up my boss's expectations. This comes after my boss followed up on me on Slack a few days ago, asking me if I had finished one of the courses he \"invested in me\", ($21 course on udemy, though complicated and time-consuming) that would help the team. This is on top of me being stretched thin between two people I am supporting in the company and being constantly on call, working till late hours.\n\nI said I didn't have the time yet, but it's on the list. \n\nHe said, \"Oh, no problem. Catch up on break.\" I gave a positive emoji before I stopped to think.\n\nWhen he wanted me to do the course, he also said that it's so that I \"work for what he's paying\". For the first few months of working there, I had very little prior experience, so he only paid me around 2000 a month. Now he's paying a little more than double. He also said that he's giving me opportunity to learn a lot (which is true, I work with a couple talented coders). But also I don't get too much time to learn from them since everyone is very stretched thin. \n\nI have no benefits, Iwork as a contractor, I work my ass off, but also he kind of \"took a chance\" on me, even though I bloody built his company and he made literally hundreds of thousands of dollars on my back, while critisizing and putting a huge amount of pressure all the time on me especially. I was the first employee and he hasn't even given me written confirmation of stocks. I don't even know percentages of them and what I'll get.",

        "text": "Another post reminded me of my own malicious compliance from a few years ago. \n\nI am a CNA who works night shift at a hospital. I have always made sure to knock on a patient’s door before going in their room not only out of respect to them and their privacy, but also because I do everything to make sure they are awake before I start doing vitals, because there is nothing quite like having a patient start flailing in winging when you go to put on a blood pressure cuff because you have startled them out of sleep.\n\nA few years ago I did my normal knocking on the door, at a normal knocking noise level, and announced myself as I came in the room, but the patient didn’t wake up. I feel I should mention that this particular person was young and not hard of hearing, so a regular knock should have sufficed. \n\nMy next step is to lightly touch their shoulder and announce myself, again. This startled them awake and they went off on me that I needed to knock before coming in. I apologized and let them know that I HAD knocked, but it must not have woke them. Their response was “Well then, you need to knock louder.”\n\nAfter they were done bitching about the knocking, they demanded some juice. I went to get what they had requested and when I came back I knocked on their door with what could best be described as just less than pounding. After all, they had told me to knock louder. \n\nApparently they didn’t like that, either, and they fired me. I was fine with that, they’d been rude and demanding all night so I was fine with not having to go back in their room anymore.",

        "text": "While in college, I had a co-op semester in a shop environment with a small company.  My position was a designer with their product development team, and there were not very many tools available to make things.  We were expected to produce concept prototypes out of carstock and Elmer's glue.  When our first presentation was met with disappointment since they \"just hired this new intern to improve the quality of deliverables\" (referring to me), I decided to do something about it.\n\nOver the next couple of weeks I started bringing in my own tools from my personal shop.  I had a whole menagerie of woodworking tools, automotive tools, my welder, and even a couple of my 3D printers.  I turned their chintzy studio area into a respectable prototyping space.  The next presentation went very well when we were able to show a very fancy model paired with CAD designs and the associated 3D prints, detailed woodwork, and even bespoke metal details.  Everyone was very happy, and I got to work with my own tools at my job.  It was good times.\n\nThen came the reversal.  The company had originally hired me as part of their expansion, and about 2 months after I had joined (roughly a month after I built their shop) the company was finally big enough to hire a single HR person.  If you have ever had to compete with the mental gymnastics of Human Resources, I am sure you know where I am going with this.\n\nOne evening, I was staying late to work on some personal projects.  My immediate supervisor and everyone I worked with was aware that I did this.  New HR lady was not.  The day after, she called me in for a chat.  It essentially went like this:\n\n\"Why did you leave so late after clocking out last night?\"\n\"I was just working on some personal projects.\"\n\"Ok well you cant use the company space for personal projects.  It is against policy\"\n\"Why?  It has bever been a problem before\"\n\"Running a shop costs money, and if that money isn't invested into the companies projects, then it isnt a good use of company funds\"\n\nNow I know the running of a shop costs some money in power, labor and maintenance, but I was clocked out and the tools were basically all my own personal tools.  So I said:\n\"I was clocked out and only using my own tools.  The company isn't actually spending anything for me to do my own work\"\n\"Regardless, while on company property you will only work on company projects.  If you want to work on personal projects, you must do it in your own shop.\"\n\nI considered explaining how the shop is 95% all my tools and equipment, but I only had about a month left in my co-op before heading back to classes next semester, and I was planning on taking my tools back by that time anyway, so cue malicious compliance.  \n\nI concluded the conversation with HR lady by asking for a transcription of her verdict in an email.  I then waited until everyone had left from work the next day, then spent about an hour rounding up all of my tools and putting them in the back of my truck.  I took them home, and the next day went in to work to find my department in chaos.  \n\nI was immediately called into my supervisor's office and sat down.  My supervisor was a pretty chill guy, so he calmly asked why I cleaned out my stuff.  I simply showed him the email from HR lady, and explained that if I can only do company projects on company property, then I will also only use my personal property for personal projects.  \n\nHe laughed a bit to himself under his breath, asked me to forward the email to him, and then dismissed me.  For the next month, I happily glued pieces of paper together to make simple form models while the entire department fell apart.  We were unable to complete promised prototypes for our biggest client, lost that client as a result, and I left the company for good shortly thereafter.\n\nIf you are going to run a company, it helps to provide your employees the equipment they need to adequately do their job.",

Without further ado. \n\n————————-\n\nI worked in a number of ER’s in a number of states over a 13 year period. In all areas, people would FREQUENTLY say they needed a doctor’s note to explain missing work that day for an illness or injury. \n\nIt seems like virtually every employer was unaware of the fact that nurses can write doctor notes. Without a doctor’s oversight.  As long as we didn’t stupidly and outrageously abuse it, nobody cared. Hell, in one ER, we had these Mad Libs-esque, pre-typed doctors notes that were already filled out and signed… we just had to circle the number of days they were to be off. Or specific restrictions to work, such as ‘cannot lift anything above 3 lbs.’ \n\nLet’s just say in 13 years, if anyone had an even *remotely* plausible and reasonable request, it was granted and then some. :)\n\nETA: oh you were worried you were having a miscarriage and wanted your husband with you? He gets a note too. You’re single and wanted your friend with you? Note. Your mom? NOTE.\n\nETA 2: oh i forgot another thing i had fun with. Some idiot employers or schools would tell the parent or patient they also needed to know the diagnosis. Which they have absolutely no right to. So i would go ahead and cover them there as well. ‘John Doe DOB 01/01/1896 is required to stay home from work for the next five (5) days and may return to work on 03/32/2022. The reason for this is due to medical diagnoses which require strict bed rest. Of note, private medical information with a patients employer is a blatant HIPAA violation and will not be discussed.’ They don’t need to know it’s because they’re having anxiety. 😇",

Shoulder and Wrist are the most commonly effected areas. But risk can be reduced with economic tools which my company is refusing to buy.\n\nI work with trigger action drills a lot. These are really bad for your wrists and shoulders. We've complained but more ergonomic tools are slower and we must not affect production.\n\nThere are areas in my work we don't work with them often (Good Area)- so we take turns (in the Bad Area). One of my coworkers has been placed on restricted duty so he gets to skip his turn.\n\nCouple of weeks ago, my coworker was out due to their injury so I was placed in the Bad area for an extended amount of time- taking his turn and mine. After a couple of days, my bad wrist started bothering me. \n\nAt previous employers, you'd complain to your direct supervisor, they'd send you to the nurse (on site), the nurse would restrict you to work that would not bother the injury, you'd rest and ice it in your off time and be back to full duty in a couple of days.\n\nThis is not what my current employer wanted to do. Instead, I reported it to my direct supervisor. I think he thought I was lying because no one wants to work in the bad area. He said \"If it hurts that bad, you'll need to file an accident report.\" I said \"But there is no accident to report its just a strain injury.\" He rebutted with \"We cannot make exceptions without documentation.\" Ight. We filled out an accident report- put me of light duty. Extra Light Duty- it was fine, boring and I was not to use my dominant hand at all. \n\nSaw the nurse the next day. Nurse basically tells me what I already know. It's a stress injury. There's nothing to do about it but take a Tylenol and ice it. She has me stay on light duty until I get a doctor's note to confirm her speculation.\n\nBasically, I need a Doctor's note to say I'm fine. Because after a couple of days of light duty and not using it at all, the pain and swelling had gone away.\n\nI felt like this all could have been avoided if my boss would have given me a little compassion and benefit of the doubt. I dont complain usually- I kind of like the bad area (pacing is good, the work is less tedious but the physical strain gets to everyone). And now I have to pay for an urgent care visit- cool.\n\nSo I go to Urgent Care and I wait 2 hours to see this poor RN who has been called in on back to the clinic after a 14-hour shift (due to an abundance of patients and poor scheduling) so he can write me a note that says \"LolGobz has nothing wrong with them\". I told him I thought it was stupid and a waste of his time and mine. He agreed. He wrote the note and when it was given to me it said \"LolGobz is fine to be on regular duty but cannot use trigger action drills more than 8 hours a week\". \n\nWait... what?\n\nI can work a little more than one shift in the bad area. A week. From now on. The Visit Summary Paperwork included a small note from the RN- \"If pain or swelling returns, reduction of this type of work may be needed. If you have any concerns, I can be reached at (phone number); my time is your's.\"\n\nScheduling around my coworker's injury and my doctor's note has been... tricky. My boss complains about it but he literally made me do it.",

        "text": "For just about the last three decades, I (58m) have been designing software. I've gotten pretty decent at it, too. There are of course challenges, like insane business requirements, or ridiculous deliverable timelines, or micromanaging product owners, or the ever-popular design-by-committee; but the worst, and I mean WORST, is that everybody who uses software thinks they know how to design it. (Spoiler alert: they do not.) There are design rules. There are best practices. There are laws. There are nuances to accessibility and localization. There are technical constraints. Try to explain that to a stakeholder who can barely spell HTML and thinks they're a wiz with MS Paint, and savor the empty stare and vacant eyes. But hey - they've worked there for years, so they know best!\n\nWell. A few years ago, I took a gig at a small software company with a complex and well-established, if antiquated, niche software product. They wanted to modernize it and bring it to the web. Excellent - just what I specialize in. I settled in for a few months of learning the software, the customers and their needs, and the industry it served. All was hunky-dory while I was off on Research Island, but the time came to start putting actual proposals together and doing some testing. This is where the real fun started.\n\nThe team leader I was assigned to was a mediocre dev who'd failed upward into management, and argued with every damn thing I said or proposed. No, Bert, the buttons should NOT all be scattered randomly on the page. Yes, Bert, colors do actually need to be consistent and mean something. No, Bert, you shouldn't create a new custom widget to replace a well-established HTML control because you didn't like the thickness of a line. And so on. And because dealing with this yutz wasn't enough of a challenge, the business dev guy they threw at the team demanded that we create all specs and design artifacts during daily 5-hour workshop meetings, where everybody could have a say about everything. In Elmo's  view, nobody would be above anyone else with their annoying \"skills\" or \"knowledge\" about anything. No, we would all talk it out, and hey, remember kids, there are no wrong answers! As a bonus we'll hold a vote on every decision, because yeah, your uninformed opinion is just as valid as my three decades of experience. Design patterns which would normally take me about an hour of wireframing took five people a full week, and the \"design\" they settled on sucked wet farts out of dead pigeons. Trying to tell the team that I could generate some examples they could then take and adjust went over about as you'd expect: not at all. \n\nThe cherry on this crap sundae was the dev they brought in to prototype the thing. In a final attempt to help move things forward, I slapped together a very quick wireframe mockup in HTML, which sent Ernie the dev into paroxysms of fury. How dare I invade his domain and create any code? That was HIS job. He demanded that he was the expert, and I should let him take care of everything. For reference: he'd found Google's Material Design site and did a copypasta of their generic framework. Zero customization, zero color, zero personality. It was like selling a house with drywall installed, but no finish. As expected, his work was shit, and any feedback or suggestions, no matter how politely framed, were met with not only scorn and derision, but anger at my temerity to question his skillz, meager as they were.\n\nBy now, not only was I a trouble-making elitist who thought I could do a better job than the team (gasp - I could), but now I was a complainer. Middle manager Bert went and whined to his boss, who called me on the carpet for 15 minutes just as I was on my way out the door one Friday. I didn't know what the hell he was talking about, but apparently I wasn't a \"team player\". I was instructed to only provide input when asked. Period.\n\nMalicious compliance incoming.\n\nI sat in meetings for hours, watching the clownshow and counting down to lunchtime. Nobody asked my opinion, so nobody received my opinion. Questions to me were few and far between, and my replies were as neutral and generic as I could make them. At the end of the week, I started getting uninvited to the workshop meetings. Since that was my only deliverable, I sat at my desk with nothing else to do. At all. After all, I wasn't supposed to do anything without being asked.\n\nAfter about two weeks of this, I figured I'd cover my ass a little, and asked Bert's boss if there were any changes in his instructions. There were not - apparently I was doing exactly what they wanted. So, back to my desk and more hours of waiting to go home. I didn't think this would go on forever... after all, the executive team who hired me into this role knew for a fact they needed my expertise, their customers informed them almost daily of how outdated the software was. So I sat and did online training and read professional journals and surfed Reddit on my phone, all while watching the frantic pace of ready-for-the-dumpster software being developed all around me. And sat. And waited.\n\nFor three months.\n\nThese idiots actually paid me to sit on my hands for more than three months. Now, although these clowns were utterly incompetent, the people who ran the company weren't. At some point, they were going to discover what a garbage pile their minions were carefully splooging together, and somebody was going to be blamed. Pretty obvious that the guy who hadn't participated for a quarter year would be the designated scapegoat, so I found another position and bailed before they managed to pull their head out of their asses long enough to find somebody to fire. As I was strolling out the door, they were planning on a big release to introduce their \"All new updated wonderful product!\" To be launched after \"all the bugs were ironed out.\"\n\nIt's been three years since I left. The product never launched.\n\nTo those who say, \"I'd love a job where I don't have to do anything!\" I'm sure for some people that would be heaven. But for me, having no purpose was a waste of life. If I'm going to spend my time on something, it's going to be something where I can make a difference. Anything else is a waste. Plus, the days draaaaaaaagged.\n\ntl;dr: company hires design expert to update their product, but idiot co-workers sideline expert and spend months designing a project that never launched, then pay 3+ months salary for expert to train and interview for new job.",

        "text": "During my undergraduate studies, I worked as a cashier in a large hardware store. Usually I worked in the building materials department. To be honest, many customers drove me crazy with the stupid things they would say and do, but I could usually muster a fake smile, and I was almost always polite. I am also often told that I am soft spoken, but this was rarely an issue and I didn't mind if I was asked to speak louder. Well, assuming they were polite, of course.\n\nThis happened on a Saturday in winter. Things were not too busy at this time, so I'd have a few customers come through occasionally. Mostly I focused on keeping coffee made for coworkers, customers and I. This department was typically pretty noisy with all the people around and power equipment being used, but it was much more quiet at this time.\n\n***\n\nAt some point, I had a couple come to my desk to be checked out. They were probably in their mid 60s. They seemed like normal, polite people. \n\n*Note that the entire time I spoke with them prior to ending the transaction, I had no indication at all that either of them were unable to hear me.*\n\nI finished ringing them up. \"Alright, your total is $32.42.\"\n\nThe woman filled out the check and handed it to me. It was for $32.22.\n\n\"Oh I'm sorry, the total is $32.42. Would you mind correcting that on your check?\" I asked.\n\n\"Sure\" she said, taking the check and changing a few numbers and words. She handed it back to me, and it was now good for $32.32.\n\nAfter picking up the check and seeing it's still wrong, I paused for a minute because I felt like she was going to promptly flip her shit over being corrected again. If it had been cash, I wouldn't have even bothered correcting her the first time. We also weren't allowed to write on checks ourselves.\n\nI took a breath. \n\n\"I'm sorry but the total is $32.42. Would you mind correcting the total on your check?\"\n\nThe woman scoffed. \"This is ridiculous! I shouldn't have to correct a check two times because I can't understand you!\" she said in a shrill harpy voice. She aggressively wrote on the check. \"Speak up,\" she growled.\n\nI did not react to this. She finished the check and handed it to me, again. It was correct this time, so I took it and ran it through the check reader on the register. The receipt printed. I tore it off and moved to hand it to the woman.\n\n\"THANK YOU! HAVE A GREAT DAY!\" I said loudly enough to *almost* be a yell, but not quite. The woman jumped, spooked by the sudden change in volume of my voice. Seeing this caused my polite smile to evolve into a delighted smile.\n\nThe woman's face twisted from wide-eyed shock into a pout. \"Yeah, thanks for nothin'!\" she snarled.\n\nShe grabbed her bag and stomped out of the store. Her bewildered husband followed her out.\n\nPerhaps this malicious compliance is small, but it makes me smile every time I think about it.",

Barely lets me answer as he grabs some that me and sales lady had already discounted (because they were twice as much) and suggests that they would be a much better option. \n\nMildly irritated at this point - I was enjoying chatting to sales lady - I list some of the reasons that she told me they weren't a good fit. Sales guy rolls his eyes, says she just a trainee, and the expensive ones are really the ones I want. Eventually it takes quite a stern no, to stop him trying to upsell me. \n\nAt this point I really just want to walk out the shop, but I suffer from the occasionally debilitating condition of being English, and that kind of embarrassment is just too much to take. Instead I'll buy them, and go home fantasising about all of the cool things I should have said.\n\nSo card in hand, I'm just about to pay and he asks about whether I want insurance. \"no, just that thanks\"\n\n\"You really should have insurance, they are very delicate, it doesn't take much to knock a lense out of alignment\"\n\n\"no, its fine, just the binoculars please\" \n\n\"You probably shouldn't buy them without the insurance\" \n\nFinally given a way out, I nod and agree, and he runs out the back to get the paperwork for the insurance. He comes back and asks me for my name 'for the insurance' \n\n\"oh no, sorry, I was agreeing with you that I shouldn't buy them, not if they are that delicate. I'm quite clumsy, so I'd definitely break them\" \n\nHe tries to backtrack on some of the ones that Sales Lady had suggested, saying that they would actually be perfect for me. I reminded him he said they weren't very good. \n\nThen I thanked him for helping me see that I really didn't need to spend all of that money on binoculars, and walked out.",

        "text": "This was a few years ago... I worked my way through college as a produce clerk.  It was a good job back then... you could actually pay for college (SJSU) on grocery wages back then.\n\nThen the company hired a new manager, let's call him **A-hole**.  A-hole was a tyrant.  The union had agreed to a new deal with a lower wages for new hires.  A-hole decided his job was to push out \"old timers\" being paid under the old contract.  Some of these people had been working there as full-time clerks for 20-25 years.  Now they were only get 16 hours a week. Complain? OK, now you are on overnight stock duty. Many of these clerks were middle aged women that had never worked stock duty and could not tolerate the physical demands - and were forced to leave.\n\nMe, I was a college student working about 25-30 hours a week.  A-hole put me and a few others on nightly stock duty at 40+ hours/week for months.  Between school and work I was exhausted but could not afford to quit.  Fortunately for me, another produce clerk quit and he had to move me back to the produce department.\n\nEnter the new head of produce. Let's call him D-wad... D-wad was young, cocky and trying to tow the line with A-hole. Some bullies get power from the bigger bully behind them.  D-wad would give us cr\\*p about silly.stuff or change compliance rules without notice.  Me, I decided to keep my head down and let the bullets pass over me as much as possible.\n\nQueue malicious banana compliance...\n\nOne day we receive our produce order with about 50 cases of bananas. That's a lot of bananas, usually we get a dozen or two cases because we all know *bananas have a limited shelf life.*.. maybe a week.  We have some tricks to keep them from turning early; keep them cool and unwrapping the plastic is a good place to start as the plastic traps gases that cause them to ripen more quickly.\n\nD-wad produce guy tells me, *\"I want all the bananas on the front end display.\"* I immediately knew this was a really bad idea.  That many bananas all on top of each other would cause them to *bruise* and ripen *way too fast,* but I knew not to push back - so I did exactly as he instructed.\n\nI built a very large display right in front of the entry door with bananas stacked 4+ bunches deep. I even extended the display to accommodate more bananas. It was huge and could not be overlooked.\n\nRe-enter A-hole... A-hole comes walking in the entrance just as I'm finishing the last two boxes... his face goes three shades of purple and he starts screaming at me (*why is it OK to scream at employees in public?*),\n\n***\"What the. h\\*ll are doing with all those bananas??!, Do you have any idea what's going to happen??..(blah, blah blah).\"*** after ranting a bit more, he screws on his angry face really tightly and through his snarling lips he says, ***\"What were you thinking?\"***\n\nI have been waiting for this moment..., I slowly shrugged my shoulders and said,\n\n *\"D-wad told me to* ***put up ALL of the bananas****. So that is what I did.\"* \n\nThe color drained from his face.  He had created an environment where we could not second guess management - so even though *I knew better* I **had to** do exactly what I was told. He caught his breath a bit, *\"Cut that display down and put most of the bananas back in their cases.\"*\n\nWe still lost a few cases of over-ripe/bruised bananas that week. D-wad never said anything to me, but I knew he was ***pissed***. A short time later he tried to write me up for something unrelated, I signed it with *\"I do not agree\"* on the signature line, and **2 days later D-wad as gone.**  I stayed with the store for another year while I finishing my degree, but was so glad to get out of that toxic stew.",

        "text": "Stayin' vague cos reasons...\n\nI used to work in manufacturing, and was part of a process engineering (PE) team. The team would create areas for members to work in with specific equipment for the job.\nMy job was to price up and order and install the equipment.\nThe equipment was in kit form, and every area needed a version of the kit.\n(Like a jigsaw, some needed a 200 piece, some needed a 1000, but it was all the same bits)\n\nWe were tasked with a new process, the PE's figured out what they wanted, and I set about pricing it all up, using what I already had, and created a order, receipt and install plan. \n\nNew process was 12 weeks away, and the stuff I needed had a 6 week lead time. No problem!\n\nThat was until the money men pulled all funding, and new directive was to install new process with zero cost. Genius.\n\nSo, at 12 weeks to go, I told all the PE's, there's gunna be no new equipment. I moved on to other tasks, abandoning all the kit work.\n\nWe have weekly meetings, where I report, every week, \"well, I have no money, so no new kits!\"\n\nAt 5 weeks to go, all the PE's and manufacturing teams eventually realise, they are in trouble. Without the kits, they have massive increases in their process times, and won't achieve the process.\n\nSo they all go, en masse, to the money men \"we need these kits!\" \n\nAfter a few days, one of my bosses (I had loads) comes to me and says \"got you the money! Order them kits!\"\n\n\"Well, it's a bit useless to ask now\" I reply \"all the kit plans are from 12 weeks ago, and apart from the fact most of the PE's plans will have changed, the kits won't get here in time anyway, as its 4 weeks to go and the stuff needs to ordered 6 weeks before\"\n\n\"Just order it anyway, well sort it...\" he demands.\n\n\"There's no point boss! That ship has sailed, supplier won't be able to deliver\"\n\n\"Right, let's go talk to the supplier\"\n\nSo off we go (3 hr drive) where my boss asks the supplier \"what can we do to get the kits on time?\" \n\n\"Order it when OP told you to (I could've kissed him) but whatever we do now, I cannot guarantee when you will get it, so plan for 6 weeks\"\n\nI was asked to leave the room, where I assume they discussed money. I believe (not certain) the original cost I had priced up was nearly doubled.\n\nSo. Back in the office next day, with 4 weeks to go, Boss comes to me and says, \"can you create a receiving plan for the kits please\"\n\nSo I do, with a 6 week lead time, to arrive 2 weeks later than we need it. I show the boss.\n\n\"Change the receiving date to 4 weeks, not 6\"\n\n\"But that's not correct boss?\"\n\n\"Just do it, I'll lean on supplier, get it sorted\"\n\nI redo the plan, 4 week lead time, not 6. I print off a couple of copies. Give one to Boss (1), then go straight to another boss (2) and inform him of what's going on. Boss2 thanks me for the info, and follows Boss1 into a manager meeting, where sure enough, Boss1 tells everyone the kits will be here in 4 weeks. Lots of \"well dones\" and \"good jobs\" are slapped upon Boss1....\n\nIn the next 4 weeks, Boss1 rings supplier everyday, and reports back everything is peachy. Boss2 gets me to follow up daily with supplier, and it's far from peachy. They are in chaos, trying to get multiple kits together with zero prep and short lead time.\n\nInstall day arrives. Supplier has not been ready. Boss1 insists they send what they have. Boss1 feeds back there's a delay.\n\nUpper management are furious. \"Who told you that it would be ready?\"\nBoss1 \"I was just going off the receiving schedule\"\n\nBoss2 interjects, \"excuse me, but my equipment guy gave me a plan that did say 6 weeks!\"\n\nUpper management \"who is doing 2 different schedules?\"\n\nBoss1 \"there's obviously been a mistake, I'll investigate\"\n\nUM, \"Where did you get that schedule?\" \n\nBoss1 \"let's take this outside this meeting and I'll fully brief you\"\n\nAnyway, So remember I said it's like a jigsaw? The first delivery, Supplier sent the corner pieces... for every kit.\n\nNext day, the bottom edge pieces, for every kit.\n\nThe next, the top edge pieces, for every kit.\n\nBasically, we ended up receiving a bit of every jigsaw every day.\n\nFor 2 weeks. \n\nSo 6 weeks after ordering, all the jigsaws were in, exactly like I told them they would be...\n\nThanks to a bit of jiggery pokery on my part, we managed (with my excellent team) to install kits daily, by using the new stuff and bastardising old stuff. I was kind of the face of the kits, so I wanted it in to save face really.\n\nNo one ever asked me about the schedules, and boss 2 tells me that the right people found out what happened. Boss1 was told that he needed to relocate to another country, or there wasn't a position for him anymore. So he basically was forced to leave our site.\n\nI eventually had my fill too, I left soon after. Who wants to be in a job where the very thing they employ you to do, they tell you you are wrong and ignore you, then ask you to pick up the pieces of the wreckage afterwards?",

        "text": "This happened when I was a child and was visiting my grandparents for one of the first times over the summer. Apparently, I learned malicious compliance at a young age. \n\nA little bit of background. My grandparents grew up in the great depression and were pretty old school in that since. You ate everything on your plate, regardless of if you didn't like it. You did not waste food just because you didn't like it. I didn't really care as I was by no means a picky eater. But there were a few things I just didn't like and one thing in particular I basically couldn't eat as it would make me gag. What was this food? Zucchini. I wasn't a big fan of squash to begin with, but something about the texture and the taste would just cause an immediate gag reflex for zucchini. \n\nMy grandma LOVES zucchini. It's one of her favorite veggies. So, one night she made it and before she even put it on my plate I told her I didn't like it and really couldn't eat it. I'm going to assume my grandparents just assumed I was being a kid and complaining about it because I didn't like it or hadn't really tried it. I don't know why they may have thought this as I had never said anything about any other veggies they served and ate everything on my plate without being told usually. \n\nSo, my grandma says that she wants me to at least eat some and puts some on my plate. It wasn't a lot. Maybe 2 servings spoons worth. I tell her again I really can't stand zucchini. She replies that it can't be that bad. Little did she know.\n\nSo we sat down to eat and it was the first thing I ate (I usually eat the things I like the least first). First bite, almost instant gag... and I continue to gag as I chew it a force it down. I don't know if they just thought I was trying to get out of eating but they said nothing. Next bite, same thing. I'm now starting to have tears from the continual gagging. Still nothing from my grandparents, but I see them look at each other. I don't complain though nor try pull the \"See, I told you I didn't like it.\" Nope, just kept on eating and gagging. \n\nI don't know if you've ever tried to eat while someone is gagging, but most people can't do it and lose their appetite. I think I got maybe two or three more bites in and then my grandpa tells me I don't have to eat it anymore if I don't want to. I do stop but still gag a little as the taste is still in my mouth and I'm whipping the tears off my face before I move on to the rest of my dinner. \n\nMy grandparents never made me eat anything I didn't want after that, which wasn't much really. I can actually eat zucchini now though. Still not too big a fan.",

I didn't want her unable to call help when needed.\n\nMy wife loved drinking ice water: A tall glass would last her for hours. Unfortunately, a lot of condensation formed on the outside of the glass. You've seen those water rings on tables, I'll assume. \n\nOne day her phone started acting up. The ringer feature, in particular, wouldn't ring! Still under warranty, we took it to our provider to get a replacement. The young man opens the back of it after hearing the problem. The condensation from her ice water had flowed into the phone as it sat on the table. That voided the warranty. I loved my wife, and knew she needed the phone, but the cost of a replacement was outside our budget.

He thought for a moment, turned to his manager who nodded, and said Sure.\n\nI picked out my new phone while he reprogrammed my old one to my wife's number. Then he programed my selection. \n\nInstead of paying a couple hundred for a new phone, we both got replacements, her my used phone, me a brand new one. She used that phone for years. But kept it away from her ice water.\n\nNot so much malicious, just complying with the company policy. Even the rep was happy to see I came up with a solution.",

        "text": "Hello and happy holidays. Here is a *festive* Malicious Compliance. \n\nIn college I did part-time news and weather for a radio station, in addition to making sure all the ads ran, there was never dead air, etc. The requirements stated explicitly that you had to work weekends *even college football gamedays* in our town that worshipped college football, but of course my boss hired a guy who bragged about having season tickets and could never work Saturdays so I was left with all of them, and he whined in general that radio wasn't like \"the old days\" when he'd been a radio DJ in the 80s. K dude.\n\nThat's just an example of how this guy was, so I really wasn't *that* surprised when my boss emailed begging me to work Thanksgiving. I don't just mean work on Thanksgiving. He asked if I could spend ALL THANKSGIVING DAY at the radio station. EVERY ONE of my coworkers had requested Thanksgiving Day off. Not even a night or day shift, the entire day.\n\nMy MC wasn't toward my boss, who promised me a \"lengthy\" dinner break in addition to holiday pay. My MC was toward my idiot coworkers. I happily took the shift and told him I wanted first choice in requesting off Christmas days. Come December, I never had to so much as work around anyone else's schedule or plan when I got back to town around my job. I left town for a whole week and my boss didn't even blink at approving my request or covering those shifts. My mom was happy to wish me a happy Thanksgiving via phone call, knowing how much time I'd get to come home at Christmas (and the pay I was getting). My aunt still lived in my college town, and in addition to two hours at her house (do you really need much more than that in that situation?) I had a cup of coffee that morning with my then-boyfriend at the Starbucks across the street for maybe 30 minutes. It wasn't a grueling job, so sitting in a radio station all day wasn't the worst thing. \n\nDid my coworkers plan to work Christmas all along and just valued Thanksgiving more? *Maybe* ? But knowing them and their attitudes, it's way more likely that at least someone turned around and requested off Christmas and had to be told no.",

        "text": "Years ago I took a job in another country for a very small company that taught English. My responsibilities included reviewing and editing lesson plans created by non-native English speakers. \n\nMany of the lessons taught EU English while I am accustomed to US English, my boss (and the only other native English speaker) was from the UK. Therefore there were certain nuances that I was unfamiliar with. That being said, I was one of the better people on the team QAing but I wasn’t perfect by any means. There were often glaring mistakes I saw slip through on lessons not assigned to me to review but I never purposefully called people out for them. It was kind of a shitty company and bad lessons to begin with. But if there were glaring mistakes I would quietly fix them.\n\nOne pay period, months after I had been working there, I received a decrease in my pay along with a note explaining that the reasoning was because of X and X mistakes that had slipped through on my work. I was pissed as this was not a part of my contract but I couldn’t really contest it in this foreign country. \n\nThe note did however note that this decrease in pay for “mistakes” made on job duties was for all employees in my department. I knew that there were tons of mistakes on other lesson plans that weren’t mine. So I pulled up the first one and began sending messages in the group chat of every mistake I could find. And there were a lot. \n\nI did this rapid fire until my my boss who was sitting across from me sent me a message that essentially said:\n\n“Don’t worry I can assure you I am being held to the same standards and expectations” before he got up and walked away in a huff.\n\nAfter he walked out of earshot my other coworker laughed and said he had messaged her and asked how I knew that particular lesson was one he had QA’d. I told her I didn’t know I had just pulled up the first one I knew there were mistakes on. I didn’t get anymore money taken out of my paychecks after that but I left the company shortly after.",

The disciplinarian wouldnt budge because the dress code said  belt had to be leather.... so off to detention I went.  Que me thinking of how to maliciously comply...and my grandfather was a master tailor who would do anything for me.   I went to Big and Tall clearance section and bought the UGLIEST, loudest, and biggest rayon shirt and pants I could find.  My grandfather darted the shirt in as many places as he could. He took in the pants so much the pockets touched the center back seam, put 3\" cuffs on them, pleats on the back, and tapered the ankles to 8\" with a HUGE break.  When he was done, he had me try it on and gave me an ORANGE leather belt to go with them.  I cant even begin to tell you how many neon colors were on the shirt, pants were a muted olive green, orange belt, hideous multicolored argyle socks, white patent leather slip on dress shoes, and since it was winter, I paired it with a 70s chocolate brown pleather trenchcoat.   I went to school strutting like a peacock.  Disciplinarian takes one look at me and tells me to get in his office.  While in his office, he asks me if I think the dress code is a joke.  To which I tell him, absolutely not, i dont want to get in more trouble for violating it which is why I'm in dress code.   He looks like hes about to flip his shit when he realizes, because he knows the book like the back of his hand, that the dress code says \" all clothes must be properly fitting/tailored, dress pants or khaki style pants, shirts can be long sleeve or short with a collar, dress socks to be work at all times, dress shoes or boat shoes, and a leather belt must always be worn\" Theres more, but it applies to turtlenecks, jackets, blazers, and sweaters.   Hes looking at me with his eyes twitching  and asks me if I know how ridiculous I look.  I told him that I think I look awesome and I have a well tailored/fitting outfit, with a leather belt, dress socks and shoes.  He says, but you dont come close to matching.  I ask him where it says we have to match in the dresscode....he tells me to get the fuck out of his sight...lmao",

        "text": "I feel like everything I write turns into a novel. Anyways, this one has a satisfying ending. I hope you enjoy. TL; DR: Years ago, at a hospital where I worked as a study coordinator, the pharmacy department tried to get out of working during a snowstorm. They also had very stringent desires to leave at exactly 4:30, and they asked me to act unethically so that they could leave on time, even though I'd have to stay late regardless. Now they're forced to stay late too, whereas if they'd have just shut their mouths and driven in one snowstorm, they'd still get to leave at 4:30.\n\nOnce upon a time I worked in a research hospital coordinating drug studies. This one's gonna go against the grain of some of the stories here. When you work in healthcare, following the written laws and rules to the letter is of the utmost importance. We run into trouble when people begin inventing their own rules and playing by them.\n\nThe hardest part of my job was convincing other departments to also do their jobs, and sometimes it was like pulling teeth asking people to perform their duties at even a basic level. Ask a nurse to draw a basic 4-tube blood kit? You got an eye roll. Ask the pharmacy to stay 5 minutes past the end of the workday? Nope, they couldn't do that, they were out at 4:30.\n\nThat second scenario is the important one for the purposes of this story. That department REFUSES to stay late. I could understand why they'd feel that way and strive to maintain as steady a schedule as possible, but in the world of sick and dying people, sometimes things came up. Mind you, I regularly had to stay an hour or two past the end of my shift to take care of problems and data entry. We could get overtime pay or flex our schedules pretty easily at least in my department.\n\nThis hospital was in a very snowy metropolitan area, and one time years ago we were projected to get a massive blizzard. Every one of us -- the nurses, the physicians, the pharmacists, and the coordinators -- were essential employees (or whatever they called it before COVID popularized the term) and had to come in regardless of the weather. So every one of us should have been planning to be there the next day even if the weather was awful. (We had to call in sick if we missed work for weather reasons.)\n\nThe afternoon before the storm was due to begin, we had a patient in clinic. Typically, patients on this particular research study got a doctor's appointment and then treatment immediately after. However, this individual had a job that made him prefer getting his clinic visit done in the afternoon and his treatment early the next morning. It was unusual, but it wasn't hard to accomodate him.\n\nWhile most of us had accepted our fate of driving in the snow the next morning, the investigational drug department was especially not too excited about the prospect of having to come in during the blizzard. So at 3:30 -- an hour before the pharmacy closes -- they send me a Slack message and ask us what the possibility of doing this patient's treatment TODAY might be so they don't have to come in for it tomorrow. Really? You're asking us NOW? This was on your docket ALL DAY. Anyhow, I begrudgingly went to find the patient in the waiting room and ask. He wasn't thrilled, but says he'll do it if he has to. I let the pharmacy know.\n\nThen they asked me what the status of the patient was. Clinic was running behind (as usual) and we hadn't cleared the patient for treatment yet. The investigational pharmacy needed at least 20 minutes to prep the drugs needed, so they told us we had till 4pm to get them the signed order. The process for getting a drug order filled involved:  \n\n\\- getting a signed order from a doctor after a patient has been cleared to get a drug  \n\n\\- walking it outside across the street to the pharmacy  \n\n\\- handing the signed prescription to a pharmacist\n\n\\- waiting for the drug\n\n\\- walking it back to the patient in the first building\n\nThis was absolutely not going to happen in \\~12 minutes. \n\nAt 4:01, pharmacy sent me a very rude Slack message indicating that I'd basically missed my window to get the patient in today and I should do a better next time (as a coordinator, you got blamed for absolutely everything even if it was the fault of a doctor who was bad at time management). Their message said something along the lines of, \"If you don't come up and give a pharmacist the order by 4:05, there's nothing we can do for your patient. In the future, you should get the order signed and over to us ahead of time so we can prep it.\"\n\n\"Ahead of time,\" in this case, meant that a patient would been prescribed a drug but wasn't yet cleared by a doctor to receive that drug. In my training, the pharmacy director told us we were never ever supposed to do this. It was a HUMONGOUS no-no and would be grounds for a massive lawsuit if anything went wrong. You absolutely don't prep a drug unless the patient receiving it is cleared for treatment by a physician.\n\nI really liked the pharmacy director, and I messaged her regularly with questions about drugs patients might be considering while on study, but she wasn't super involved in the day-to-day of the pharmacy workers and tended to focus on bigger-picture tasks. Hence why her employees were inventing their own rules and demands.\n\nHmm, so I'm supposed to get this patient in today, right now, eh? All right, if you insist.\n\nSo I got the order signed by the physician ahead of seeing the patient (they didn't really give a shit). Next step, in the words of the person who messaged me, was to take it to a pharmacist, eh? You said I had to take it to a pharmacist by 4:05, right? What if, instead of walking it directly to the pharmacy, I took it directly to the pharmacy director? She was still a pharmacist and could do everything the folks in the investigational drug dispensary could do.\n\nI told her that we hadn't cleared this patient, but I had been urged by pharmacy to dispense the drug anyhow so that the patient wouldn't have to come in tomorrow for their treatment. She looked puzzled and asked if the patient rescheduled while in clinic. I told her no -- this was at the request of the pharmacy staff so they wouldn't have to come in during a snowstorm. I showed her the message her employee had sent me.\n\nPharmacy director was unhappy with this, and said someone would just have to stay late if this was the plan. I referred her to the Slack message that said I had missed my window because they didn't plan to stay late. Director was livid and told me that she personally was going to stay late to make sure this went through. We went to the pharmacy from her office and she intended to scold this employee, but of course everyone was gone. So the two of us went and got the drug at 4:35, and I got it back to the patient.\n\nI got a call from him a week later indicating that he actually preferred getting Thursday afternoon treatment instead of having it on Friday morning, and wanted to keep that schedule going forward. I relayed this to the head of the pharmacy. I expressed uncertainty with how we'd handle this, and she said she'd get back with me.\n\nWe all got an email a few days later saying that the investigational drug department would now be staying open until 5:30, and one person would be staying late every day (rotating every day) so that someone could cover late drug orders. But I knew she only had 3 pharmacists, and they were all salaried, not hourly, which meant some of them would be covering more than one late hour a week.\n\nI went to get this patient's next dose of drug a few weeks later at about 4:45. The same woman who'd asked me to break the rules was working. I asked how she was doing, and she told me she was having to work THREE 4:30-5:30s a week... presumably because she tried to act unethically a few weeks prior. She handed me the pill bottle and slammed the window in my face.\n\nAnd to think -- if the pharmacists would have just shut up and done their jobs like they were supposed to and come in during one snowstorm, they'd still be able to leave at 4:30 every day.\n\nIf you work in healthcare or health research, don't make your own rules, kids.",

        "text": "I work for a large grocery chain. Recently they have been cutting hours to meet budgets but expect us to figure out how to get the same amount of work done in less time. The main issue with how they cut hours is that they don’t take into account the delivery schedules. On Friday’s I cover the diary department. Normally an eight hour  shift because we get a delivery and it can come in at any point within a four hour window. Some days it’s in right when I start but most days not until after my lunch. \n\nIn an attempt to save hours they have been cutting my shift in half. But the morning half and so I’ve been staying over with permission from the dairy manager to get the work done. A few weeks ago a lower level manager got mad at me for staying late and ignoring her changes to the schedule. I was fed up at this point (went from 35-38 hours a week to 28) so I said okay and planned to work whatever the schedule said the next week. I made sure to tell the dairy manager I would only work my scheduled hours and got his okay. \n\nThe Friday came and I was scheduled four hours. I came in and worked my four hours. The delivery came in and I placed it in the cooler. I had 30 minutes to put out what I could. I left four pallets of goods for the Saturday guy and walked out right on time. The next day I came in to find the Saturday guy in a complete panic because he never has that much work to do (he’s very lazy). I knew I had an  easy day in my other department so I let them know i was gonna help in dairy. I then walked into the managers office and offered to help in dairy and he was elated. Apparently they had no one to put eggs and milk on the shelf the day before and had run out and the Saturday guy was sooo behind. I got a pat on the back for my go getter attitude. Later the assistant manager asked me about leaving early and I explained what happened with the other manager to which I was told to ignore her from then on out and just work my eight hours. I was very glad to comply with that and since then my hours have increased every week.",

The reason was because I had one (1) no call, no show on accident, my schedule had changed and I didn’t know. So I didn’t come in the day I was supposed to work but came in the next day. That day I was pulled aside and told that I no longer work for the company. However I didn’t think this was fair since my co worker who got fired a week before me, had 3-4 no call, no shows and they let it slide. He was fired for poor workmanship. A few weeks later, I decided to email corporate and tell them that I didn’t think my firing was fair and that I’d like to return. They got back to me saying that they agreed that my firing was unnecessary and gave me a date to go back. Since then, the managers have never messed with me since.",

        "text": "So this is another one of those stories where the manager on a power trip decides to ignore the team and then doesn't like the outcome.\n\nRecently in my organization, there were policy changes which removed our shift timings to get shoft allowance (no big deal, that was just 3hrs pay worth a month, and we had good timings). We were also made elegible to get overtime pay as salaried employees payable at 2× rate. Great, but our manager made it clear that in our team, there will be no overtime and all work will be done in our assigned shift timings. Fine, we barely have enough work to do in our shifts and spend 2-3hrs goofing around daily.\n\nLittle background about my job - i work with a team of 8 people and we have to prepare reports once a month. The reports are due on last day of the month and we get the files for the report on 15th of each month. We have total of 7 monthly reports, 6 of which are small, one person reports, and a big one which needs all to work on it. Usually 6 people work on their assigned 6 reports and 2 people work on the big report for first few days, till the rest complete small reports so all can get to the big one. And the process is also defined like that only, that for the first few days, 2 people vet the files, format it, process it etc so after everyone is available, they can just pick their parts and work on that only.\n\nThen, last month, due to some issues on the back end, we get the files for big report at end of the day instead of morning. I ask my manager if he wants me to work ovetime to vet the data and format it correctly now, so it can be processed overnight?\nHe says no one will do overtime, you will have to do it tomorrow.  I try to explain that if the data isn't processed overnight, we will be delayed by a day and it will take me only 3 hrs to do and I'll be happy to do that. But he's sticking to his word and denies overtime.\n\nCue MC, i leave the files right there and log off, next morning i start working on it, complete the tasks and send it for processing, which took the whole day and now we are one day behind.\nOnce everyone else is done with their reports, they all get a free day because they can't do anything till our task is complete and final data is available. \n\nSince we were a day behind, all 8 people had to work on a Saturday. The manager was fine with it because as per old policy, we could work on a Saturday and get a day off after the reports are submitted. \n\nWe all are fine with it because we read the new policy correctly and we know that working on weekend will not only give an additional day off, we will be getting overtime pay for that as well.\n\nSo instead of letting me work 3 hrs of overtime, he had to make 8 people work 9 hrs of overtime and give them a day off later as well.\n\n\nUpdate : \n\nGot my payslip today with 6× of my lost shift allowance recovered with overtime. We could have found out his reaction tomorrow but the whole team has decided to use the earned leave tomorrow. We will only know on Tuesday then\n\n\nUpdate 2 :\n\nSo the manager called a few of us on our day off, no one picked up other than one guy (G). He was furious seeing the overtime, G told him that all we did was work the Saturday as he told and we put in the timing for that. It's not our fault its taken as overtime, its the new policy. So the manager just stayed silent for a bit and said he will talk to us all on Tuesday. \n\nCome Tuesday, we login to find a company wide email clarifying and changing few things about overtime. So what actually happened was an MC of a much larger scale company wide.\n\nWe had quite a few understaffed teams, mostly due to attrition, and not enough pay range, the managers of that team were not able to hire enough staff at the pay company was allowing. So those teams have put in over 30 hrs of weekly overtime as they were overworked, and managers fully supported it. Having around 30hrs of overtime meant they had to pay existing employees around 3× of their pay, and they could have hired 2 more people per team member with that much overtime. \n\nSo the company wide email said that they are adjusting the new policy, maximum of 40hrs overtime per month will be allowed, and if employees are constantly reaching that, they will re adjust the higing budget for those teams for the next year.\n\nAlso, any overtime claims will not be deducted from team budget this month, so thats probably why our manager didn't say a work about it to us on tuesday.",

        "text": "I went to a small town, Midwest high school in the early nineties. Our principal was a bit of a misogynist but it benefitted us girls occasionally. For instance, the school dress code still allowed for girls to wear hats to school. Sure it was just an overlooked bit of verbiage that was a holdover from when ladies still wore matching hats and dresses but we took full advantage of the rule. We girls could be seen sliding into class in ball caps regularly. The guys, of course, hated that we could get away with it. \n\nOne day at lunch, a male friend slipped his ball cap out of his back pocket and onto his head. The principal comes storming over to tell him to remove it immediately. My friend complains that I’m wearing my ball cap and that it’s not fair. The principal explodes and throws out, “You can start wearing a hat when you start wearing skirts!”, and storms off. My friend looked around and made eye contact with everyone within earshot, nodded, and strolled out of the cafeteria. \n\nThat afternoon was filled with hushed queries from the guys to the girls concerning how many skirts we owned and what time to drop by to borrow them. I’m pretty sure I saw more than one teacher struggling to pretend not to hear (or laugh). I know my english teacher gave us a bit of extra time to chat before starting class.\n\nThe next morning over 2/3 of the male student body showed up in skirts and ball caps. Girls lost the right to wear hats of any kind indoors soon after. It was worth it though to see the principal’s jaw drop that morning and watch him grind his teeth in frustration all day long.",

        "text": "  \n\nUnintentionally malicious? Does that count? Many years ago when I was new to professional work, I worked in IT for bank. I was in charge of managing the phone systems IVR/VRU pick your acronym. As things progressed, they wanted fancier and fancier features. One of these new features was to provide a “closed for the holiday” type experience, kindly greeting the caller and informing them that we were closed for the holiday. This also disallowed any calls to be passed through to any agents, preventing anyone from accidentally sitting on hold forever and no one being there to take the call. This was a simple enough task, I just needed a table of holidays to compare against. I reached out to my manager who deferred me to one of the bank higher ups who deferred me to someone else. I forget who, but it isn’t particularly relevant. I requested multiple times for the list of holidays over several weeks. My manger started getting on my case as to why the new feature wasn’t live. Eventually, I gave up and put together a list of holidays that I was fairly confident was accurate. I sent it off, copying my management and the others and received back a casual “looks good”. I implemented the process and away we went. \n\nA couple months later, I came back into the office on a Monday morning to be met with several higher ups and my manager who were livid and demanded to know why in the world the phone system was shut down for the weekend? Not understanding, I explained that the new feature had been implemented months ago and it was a holiday, so of course it was off. This is when I learned there were holidays and then there were “holidays” and learned banks have laws that govern when they get to close the offices. How was I supposed to know that local state holidays didn’t count? I showed them my email communications and that I had been given a nod on my proposed list of holidays. There was nothing they could do; they knew they had screwed up. I had loads of phone agents across several departments that were super happy with me that their holiday was spent peacefully quiet. I think they were eventually sent home early too, but I can’t remember for sure. Not sure why, but it took them several hours to notice that no one was getting any calls. Then it took them a while more to figure out *why.* Oddly enough, I had a definitive list of “bank holidays” provided within minutes of being in the office. Was that so hard??? Looking back, I kinda wish this had actually been with malicious intent, but alas, I was just young.",

I didn’t have a single issue with management until seven months into my employment when a male manager joined the team. He was a bit of a misogynist. He would make backhanded comments about women, and he only had issues with the female staff. He wrote me up for some ridiculous reasons, one being opening the dock door “too hard”, when it was a heavy steel door that you had to put some muscle into to open. He fired another lady who was pregnant for asking to be put in a section closest to the kitchen. She filed a lawsuit and won too. \n\nOne day, I walked into work. He pulled me into the office immediately and presented me with a write up slip. It was because I was not wearing a belt. The dress code stated “IF pants have belt loops, a belt must be worn”. Okay, my uniform that day didn’t comply with the dress code. The issue was that I hadn’t worn a belt in 7 months while he and the other managers never mentioned it. In my opinion, the appropriate thing to say would’ve been “hey, I see you haven’t been wearing a belt and we haven’t been enforcing it. Dress code says you must wear a belt if you have belt loops. I’ll give you (x amount of days) to purchase one before I start enforcing”. I just got a straight write up. \n\nSo I went home and cut off all the belt loops off all of my work pants. \n\nThe next day, immediately upon walking in, he asked where my belt was. I pointed to my pants and said “where are my belt loops?”  The employee handbook stated “IF there are belt loops” but I no longer had belt loops. \n\nLet’s just say it didn’t make him like me any more, but I felt like a hero standing up to him in such a petty manner.",

Amazing money for a 17 year old guy, back then.\n\nFriday night was the first meal. All meals were included in the guest's room costs. We had assigned stations, assigned waiters &amp; guests were assigned tables, for the week. Instead of the usual 32-36 guests, I had 12 or 14 total spread out over the three 12 tops. My waiter was very well known as the laziest, nastiest &amp; worst. The station was the furthest from the kitchen &amp; notoriously assigned the \"most demanding &amp; demeaning\" guests as well as the worst tippers. Most guests came every year for decades, &amp; you made big bucks with repeat guests. So, my assignment for the week was not going to make more than $75-100\n\nThe maitre d' was new, so he was inexperienced, although a great waiter. I had known him for 2 years. I worked that meal, breakfast &amp; lunch, expecting my 3 tables of guests to show up. Late check-ins, I hoped.\n\nAfter lunch, I approached the maitre d' &amp; asked where my guests were. He said that was all there were. I did not set my tables before leaving. The next meal was a ritual dinner, with many, many rules. The biggest meal of the year for the resort.\n\nMy house phone began to ring about 5pm. Somebody else answered &amp; took a message. About 2 hours later I called back, after the doors opened to the guests. I heard chaos in the background, as maitre d' screamed at me. I said \"If I can't have a normal station, I'm not working. I quit\".\n\nTL:DR   If you make sure I can't make money, you better have somebody ready to replace me.",

        "text": "This is a very long one and I worked here for years so A LOT happened. Yes, I should have sued but I was young and dumb. I know how this one ended so I thought I'd post it.\n\nAt (17) I was working at a fast food joint but I got an opportunity to work in office making more than minimum wage and more than any of my friends at this age. I was still in highschool and had taken on college courses as well since I was graduating early. I did all four at the same time but ended up quitting at the fast food place to focus on the office where I thought I could have a long career. Most people worked here for 20+ years.\n\nAfter my interview I was immediately hired for a Web Developing job (no experience). I learned on the job...they gave me a packet and that was it. Later on so much more would be added to my job. I did graphic design and promotions and training just to name a few. That day the CEO brings me to meet my new boss and he asks him point blank \"can you work with a woman again? We know what happened last time.\" The last woman quit who worked for him, because of him that's all I know about that. Red flag but I was 17 and stoked to be making more than minimum wage in a pretty poor area.\n\nI worked here for several years and during that time I was told (each action listed is by my manager) to \"dress like a lady,\" I was watched for long periods of time over my cubicle walls...he'd stand behind me and I wouldn't notice, and he threw my personal belongings, positive quotes, even my work I had on my walls in the trash. Other employees even started complaining about him watching me they said it was freaking out customers in the store area because that's where my cube was located right being the in house store we had.\n\nQueue malicious compliance. I get an email about productivity. I have never had a problem with that. I worked hard and always got my job done. Well he wants me to up my productivity. Okay I come up with an idea that will help me. I explain to him that if I dont list product every day but istead can do research and take all my photos at the same time doing one thing each day that I believe I can get more done that way then list at the end of the week. He agreed and productivity went up 50%. A few weeks later he calls me to his office then unleashes on me about how I'm not posting everyday. I explain that we already talked about this but he wants me to go back to the old way. Okay...I do that even though my way made more sense.\n\nAfter I go back to the old way he calls me in his office a few weeks later and lays into me about how I could be doing more. I explain that the way we have things set up right now means that I have to go get items out of the wearhouse, photograph the items I can carry, take them back and put them away, go back to my desk, edit all of the photos, make sure each item is listed in a shopping friendly way in our database, research all items that are new and we don't even have in house, add new items to the database and research those items for specs, get photos from our partners and then finally I can code them to show up on our store everyday on top of my other duties! It was a mess. Well he didn't like that. He tells me to just get it done. Okay great. I go back to my way. It meant I could spend less time walking around and I could schedule meetings all on one day instead of at random times in the week. It worked I'm back up except this time I'm up 60%.\n\n He goes to the CEO furious that I didn't listen to him. We have a meeting. Oh did I mention that my boss was so insane after every meeting he would send me emails about what a piece of crap I was for not doing things how he wanted. The CEO says the emails ultimately prove that I was more productive doing things my way and we should consider doing things this way.\n\nAnother fun one was when my manager told me I couldn't take a personal emergency call at work. I told him okay and began texting instead this just made him irrate. He went to the CEO again and said he wanted to write me up. The CEO gets both sides of the story. I tell him he can't write me up. The CEO asked why. I said he verbally warned me not to talk on my cell phone at work....so I texted which was not in the contract I signed as being a write up offense (neither was taking an emergency call). The CEO said I was right and they couldn't force me to sign a new contract so my boss had to let it go and couldn't write me up for texting at any point.\n\nWell my boss gets pissed. At one point I'm pregnant so he says he'll fire me for having to go to doctor's appointments. He actually told me everyday I came in for a year that he was looking for reasons to fire me. I live in at will state but we signed a contract. The thing is our contract started with verbal warnings, write ups were the official way to get someone fired. In all my years there I had a verbal warning about something that wasn't even a fireable offense so it didn't go on my record and I never had a write up.\n\nBefore I quit I filed harrassment against my boss...it never went in where they still forced me to work under him and report to him. I quit I'd had enough of my insane boss. 6 months later....man I should have stuck around. I found at the some of the top people started freaking out about my situation. Scared I would sue them because of the work environment they started internally investigating my former manager and CEO. They were both high up of course and the CEO was politely asked to step down and retire while my old boss was asked to take a step back from his management duties and was demoted to floor bitch.\n\nSo much more illegal stuff happened here as a female I was paid $5 less than men who did similar jobs one who even got fired 3 times made that much more than me.....It was a messy place.",

When he was about 8 or 9, he was bullied by this other kid [bully] in his neighborhood, about 11 or 12 years old, whose dad [bully's dad, or BD] had dreams of his kid becoming a prize fighter.\n\nIt turns out BD had actually instructed the bully to pick fights with my father, as he was the \"largest\" kid in the neighborhood, and BD thought my father would be a good \"sparring partner\" for the bully.\n\nMy father was extremely introverted and shied away from violence and conflict, but the bully kept pushing the matter, not taking \"no\" for an answer, and kept picking fights with my father, as instructed apparently by BD. It escalated to the point where the bully punched my father so hard in the face that my father went temporarily cross-eyed and had to wear special glasses to correct them. Police and other authorities were of no help, as this was the '50s, BD denied everything, and \"boys will be boys\".\n\nMy father finally had enough one day, and \"acquiesced\" to the bully constantly trying to drag him into a fight. Despite being 2-3 years younger, my father was roughly the same height as the bully, and had a definite weight advantage. The bully got his fight. He got his sparring partner. For one day.\n\nBy my father's recollection, it was a total curb-stomp battle; my enraged father let loose and demolished the older bully. The bully lost many of his front permanent teeth that day, and never bothered my father again.",

I had sat my ears off to the side so I could collect them later. When it was time for my class to go, I had forgotten to take my ears with me. I heard from another friend, Alex (Fake name), that Selby had threw my ears into the mud (Btw, he was coming back from the bathroom as well). I was super upset and angry at Selby. After school, me, mom, dad, Mia, and her guardian met up at the playground to find my ears. I showed them where I had put the ears, and Mia showed where she had set the ears to dry (Btw, dad had shoulder surgery the previous day). I was devastated that I lost my favorite pair of ears. To make it up to me, me and my parents went shopping to get me the same pair, but the new pair had a lot more sparkles. The next year, me and Selby were in the same class, but we weren't with Mia. Selby kept trying to pin it on Mia, but I knew she was lying. I switched schools in 5th grade. I never heard from Selby until 6th grade.

Embarrassed Apprentice begging me to stop so he could cut it off. Hit the Highway and the cars shaking like a MF with the unbalanced drive shaft. Both our phones are blowing up from boss and one of the crew. I decide to drive through town with our very prominent company name on the side of the Ute. I’d say it was 20minutes before the tie gave out. It was still on there, it just couldn’t hold tension. When me and apprentice got home he cut it off and said the under carriage was missing some paint. I said I wonder why?",

She responded with “I want nothing.”  Now I know she’ll take like half of mine so I asked her again to confirm this and again I got told “I want nothing.”\n\nRoger that!  \n\nI go into the kitchen and chuckle as a thought creeps into my head as I grab out the ice cream and make myself a massive vanilla ice cream Sunday.  Then I grab a plate. A piping bag, some home made whipped cream, caramel sauce and chocolate sauce.  I pipe out the word “Nothing” in big bold letters onto the plate in whipped cream. I go over the top of it with caramel sauce and outline it with chocolate sauce.  For good measure I look around until I find a jar of cherries and scoop out some sauce and outline it again with this.  Grab a spoon and go into the living room to deliver her a plate of nothing.\n\nAs I hand the plate to her she looks at it. Gives me a scolding look then starts to laugh and asks for the spoon.\n\nNow I know some will say this isn’t malicious because it was done without malice, but I will argue that malicious compliance on this subreddit just means confirming to the letter not the spirit of a request.",

        "text": "This was a while ago, before I managed to claw my way out of the hotel industry. Turned into a novel so there's a TLDR at the bottom.\n\nUsed to work in a hotel with about a thousand rooms. All employees were being \"crosstrained\" when I came on board which essentially meant rather than hiring enough people, every \"idle\" 5 minutes was to be spent helping out one of the other drowning departments.\n\nMost of my time was either dedicated to service or reception, but we got plenty of housekeeping &amp; tech department odd jobs thrown our way too. This was pretty normal since tech were by far the smallest department, around 3 people for 1000 cheaply constructed rooms, and housekeeping were also tiny for the impossible amount of work they had to do.\n\nSo what duties fell to reception?\n- replace door batteries, light bulbs, unclog drains \n- restock tea &amp; coffee, coffee makers, kettles, hairdryers, TP, anything guests were missing/ran out of after they checked in\n- room service for any COVID isolation cases\n- ticket stubbing for events\n- manning the bar\n- garage duties (there was a whole rental thing going on and properly returned rentals was a rarity)\n- anything else that was flung at us with the label \"urgent\" (like room tours &amp; occasionally even making our own staff lunches)\n\nIgnoring our repeated requests to cut down the number of available rooms until we had enough staff to actually PROVIDE the service we advertised, management also informed us we were there to placate the after sales cases (disgruntled customers rightly pissed off that they don't get what they're promised). So after months of going by the book, I finally found myself a comfortable little loophole.\n\nAny tech or housekeeping issue was obviously higher priority than reception since for example not having toilet paper or working lights/drains/doors was an unacceptable condition for guests, so waiting 2 hours to be checked in or book breakfast were preferable by far. Having 2-3 receptionists on shift to man 3 phones, emails, scanners &amp; printers for guest registrations (yeah we still had 1 foot in the 90's), and trouble shoot reservations, one of us would be on the desk checking people in, if another was available they'd be on digital responses (just taking one call after another while working through emails), and I would take every single tech and housekeeping job that came.\n\nIf any of use received complaints we'd explain the situation: \"I'm sorry but there's currently an emergency [insert technical/hsk issue here] that will have to take priority. If you'd be so kind as to wait in line until my colleague comes back he'll see to you upon his return.\"\n\nI'm pretty resilient when idgaf anymore so I told them to put any difficult guests in my line too unless their problem was high priority. Whenever I got back I'd have 30 mins to 2 hours to work through the line before the next thing would come up and I'd apologetically leave. When they demanded an explanation or just started yelling I'd simply explain our duties, and say I fully agree that this is not a comfortable condition for guests to be in, and they in turn would agree that providing toilet paper and other essentials needed to come first. Naturally wanting to provide all customers with the tools to improve their future experience, I always rounded off these kinds of conversations with a warm thank you and an \"If you can think of any suggestions that might improve your and other guests' future experiences here, please let us know on trip advisor - feedback, of ANY nature, is always valuable to us\"\n\nReviews came flooding in that were either talking about a massive dip in quality or how understaffed/poorly managed the place was, but funnily enough I never heard one bad word against the staff. Management didn't make a big change to the hiring policy so I eventually left, but last I heard almost everyone had quit not long after I did and the place has since rebranded, presumably to get away from the rating that dropped a couple stars.\n\n\nTLDR: We got a shitload of duties from other departments thrown at us. These duties were higher priority, so instead of cramming them into our already full workday I just dropped whatever I was doing, encouraged my colleagues to continue about their shifts, and send the complaints my way. My duty to the guest experience allowed me to inform them that they could rate us since it was the only thing that might bring actual improvements to the quality of their (next) stay. Trash guest experience &gt;&gt;&gt; trash reputation.",

I did not want to continue like this. Talked to my manager about it and asked for a better compensation deal. \n\nBut there was no deal to be made. A bigger travelexpense was out of the question! There wasn't an alternative form of compensation. No lump sum. Not  a newer company phone or laptop. No lease car. Lease cars where only for people who traveled 50.000KM per year  or  managers. *Like my manager.*\n\nHe e-mailed: \"Well, you can borrow my company car between 09:00 and 17.00 when I have no external meetings\".  Queue: Malicious Compliance.  \n\n\nSo I live almost next to \"BigClient\" that I had to visit frequently. My company is an hour away in the other direction. So you probably guessed it: I drove an hour to the office. Got the company car at the earliest possibility and drove an hour back to Big Client.  I left early because I had to turn the car in on time and then drove home again. \n\nDid this for a month or 2 when BigClient asked why I wasn't there as much as I used to and I explained the situation. This is when I found out that my manager billed my traveltime, 4 hours every visit, to BigClient. So they paid the same and got a lot less value for money.\n\nBC-Boss said he'd make this right. Two calls later I had: an apology, a big bonus for my trouble and that company car was mine. Manager was moved to another branche because he \"didn't have clients best interest at stake\".",

These jobs were mostly away from home and included some hefty tax free allowances. We would typically be there for a short amount of time and have to pay short term accommodation costs (which were high) in a motel and eat in restaurants / get takeaway as there were no kitchens. \n\nThe rate was 130 a day (910) a week and the incentive was that you could keep what you don’t spend. \n\nEnter project manager. “Your only working 5 days a week so you only get 5 days of allowances”. Ok PM then what happens on weekends where I’m still in a motel 7hrs drive from home. “Not my problem”. I ring head office in front of PM and say “I’m going to need Taxi to the airport on Friday, flights and Taxi home in city and then a return journey on Monday, which means I should get to site lunch time on Monday. \n\nPM gets pissed and tries to have his cake and eat it. Head office asks PM WTF he’s thinking as standard procedure is to pay weekends and maximise time on site (PM did not want to pay OT) \n\nLong story short is I get 7 days allowance, meet a mature age apprentice on site and offer to pay half his&amp;Gfs rent (200 a week) they both don’t get paid much so I also buy half groceries. Result is cheap rent, cheap well prepared meals and somewhere to chill on when not Working",

        "text": "Secondary account because my main Reddit account has people that know it - no idea if they view this subreddit though. This all happened today. So the ending is a little bit lackluster, but the psychotic nature of this student compels me to write this now while it's mostly fresh.\n\nI'm an ex tradesman, that quit after 10 years of absolute trash. But I was also public facing. So I have learned how to contain myself and work well, while also remaining sickening sweet when I have to talk to someone who has no idea what they're talking about. I'm doing a much more chill, relaxing IT Job at a university now... sort of. I swap shifts around with my peers, but my job when I'm on campus is to give people, mostly students, but sometimes professors, their new computers, laptops and monitors, or sometimes accessory orders like headsets. But even though I'm not an IT Technician, I'm pretty damn good at diagnosing and fixing up windows computers. \n\nThe University does not have an onsite help desk anymore due to the global spicy cough situation - and I'm stationed where their helpdesk used to be &amp; as a result for the past year, I get a lot of people coming up to me, thinking that I'm IT Support. Most of the things that come to me are things like their laptops not connecting to the university wifi, or not being able to print stuff. I have no admin access to anything as again, I'm not a technician, but I typically get about 70% of people leaving happy with a resolution. We have a large sign out the front of my kiosk, that openly states we are not IT Support, and to call the number on the sign for remote troubleshooting by the University internal IT Services, but it doesn't help much, because the much bigger overhead sign hasn't been replaced and it's at this point nearly a year out of date.\n\nHow things normally occur, is someone will come up with a problem. My typical response is \"I'm not IT Support, but I know my way around Windows. Do you mind if I take a look?\" - most are happy that I'll take time to help them. All the while I'm explaining that this kiosk is now for handing over new computers and to take back the old ones that are too old (security policy) - Anyway, I'll send them off on their way, and they know for the future to contact IT Support using the phone number.\n\nAnyway, I'm replying to an email, trying to book in an appointment time for someone to get their new fancy 64gb ram monster of a desktop, when someone it's down at the kiosk and slams what looks to be a fairly new computer on it with a fair bit of force. It's a student - so I already know where this is going. \"You must stop and help me now\" they say angrily. I smile and say that I'll help them in a second - since I remember them from last time I was on campus. They had disconnected themselves from the wifi, so I figured it was another easy solution. That wasn't good enough for them.\n\n\"No. You help me now. You are a help desk. I need help. Do your job, sit on this chair here. and help me\"\n\nGame on, as I move from my chair to the ragged brok. \"Sure thing. What can I do for you?\"\n\nS: \"My email is not working. You're IT. Fix it.\"\n\nMe: \"I'm sorry. I'm not a technician\"\n\nS: \"What do you mean? You're in IT. You're on a laptop! You're doing IT things. You're in an IT Helpdesk and you help people. Help me.\"\n\nMe: \"Sorry. I'm not a technician. You'll have to call IT Support. Their number is on the sign over there\"\n\nS: \"That's Bullshit. It says IT Support up there! *points to the outdated overhead sign* And I got help here last year!\n\nMe: \"Unfortunately, University IT Support has not had a helpdesk here for about a year, as nobody was onsite due to covid. You'll have to call them. Their number is on the sign.\"\n\nS: \"My friend got help here 2 months ago. Don't be a filthy liar\"\n\nMe: \"Sounds like they got lucky with an IT Support staff member being at the desk. As I am not a technician, you'll need to call IT Support.\"\n\nS: \"Well, why can't YOU get IT down here? You're just being lazy. I hate this. And this computer is useless! (It's a base level Microsoft Surface Go. They're absolute garbage)\n\nMe: unfortunately we only have approval to provide Surface Go laptops to students, as anything more than that has to higher education and staff.\n\nS: \"This is ridiculous!\"\n\nMe: Absolutely. The surface go is a terrible computer. You should ask ITS for approval to get a newer device if it's not good enough for you\n\nS: *scans the sign. And as if she comes up with a bright idea, notices that it says \"New computer handover\" and \"Hardware Repairs\" on it. She then takes hold of the laptop screen, and slams it shut as hard as she can. She then brings her fists down on the back of the laptop.* \"FINE. I will call them.\" *She opens the laptop. Freshly smashed screen* \"But it's broken! They can't help me!\"\n\nIt's at this point I've stood up off the chair, and sent a message to my team to call University Security, as she's gotten unruly. \"You did this to your device in front of me. And we do not deal with malicious damage. I would suggest leaving\" \n\nIt is at this point that she's getting very aggressive. \"But it is broken! You do repairs. And you don't want to fix it! You're IT Support! You need to help me. I am a student! You are so bad at your job!\"\n\nShe's beginning to shout and get a lot louder and make a bit of a scene. As I stand there with a blank face, waiting for my turn to speak to her. It doesn't come. What does come, is this absolute idiot reaching over the kiosk to try and take my work laptop. A quick left arm extends out and I've got a pretty good grip on it, while I use my right hand to push her away from it. \n\nIts the perfect time for security to rush down. Clearly I'm not the only one that sent an SOS as they rushed down, saw the crazy bitch, and pulled her away. \"HE'S IT SUPPORT. HE WON'T HELP ME. I WILL FAIL AND ITS HIS FAULT.\"\n\nIt takes quite a bit of time for IT to wrench her away, but at this point I've done my job, and I'm watching the fireworks.\n\nOnce she's calmed down, they listen to her story. That she's a student. That I'm IT, and I refused to help her. Security inform her that I'm not actually a support technician and to call the number. She picks up her broken laptop and leaves, with Security right behind her. I make a note to our team, adding in university security, to make note of the student that was forced to leave, and to refuse repairs on the laptop, as it was deliberate damage.\n\nI do not know if I have an update in the future. But we'll see what happens. This is probably the most action I've seen on campus.",

I was based in the largest development office and I went to a few remote offices a few times a year on a regular basis.  I live in a rural area and at that point in time we had no cell service around where I live.  I got a cheap flip phone and a service I could put a $25 \"charge\" on the phone for a trip, and for a long time this was never an issue.  We got bought out by a much smarter company, and after my first trip I got questioned at great length about my $25 phone charge.  Why not just get regular full service and the company would pay for that?  I told them that the only time I use the phone was when I was away from the area and the regular unlimited service was expensive.  That seemed to shut them up, but the next time I had to hit one of the remote offices I was told not to buy a phone card, and I would not be reimbursed for it if I did.  I lucked out an my flights went well so no need for a phone there, but when I got to the hotel and I wanted to call home and them them know I got there OK, and call my office to make sure things were OK, my only option was the phone in my hotel room.  This was right when cell phones were starting to squeeze that revenue stream out at the hotels and they were charging upwards of 2 bucks a minute for calls.  I made sure to call home every night as well as the office every AM, and in a week I ran up a phone bill of over a grand.  I had a hard time keeping a straight face when I put that in my expense report.  Needless to say I got called up about that, and all I could do was forward the email from my manager telling me that if I got a $25 phone card for my cell phone the company would not pay for it.  He tried to back talk, and than say that he had no way of making sure ALL of the $25 was being used and on and on, like I had a swiss bank account I was salting away cell phone minutes in and this was going to be a cash cow for me somehow.  Thankfully the director who he had called me up in front of had a brain.  He asked me why I got the cards, I told him about the phone situation and that the only reason I even owned a cell phone was for traveling for work and it was never ever an issue in the past.  I got excused from the conversation and later on I got the begrudging OK from my manager to buy a $25 card for my phone if I was going to be on the road.  I thought he was going to cry when he gave me the OK though.  Man that guy was a brown nosing putz.",

I took a pizza pan and used it as an ashtray, AFTER washing it, rinsing it, bleaching it, and rinsing it a second time.  I didn't dry it, and, in fact I left water in the shallow pan, with ash and a cigarette butt in it.  Needless to say, I had the dishes done, in less than fifteen minutes, cashed out and was off the clock, less than 20 minutes after close.

Well, the Elf is supposed to be hiding/doing something wacky every time the children wake up for the children to find. I had known that Santa wasn’t real (spoiler) since I was about 8 (thanks, Gremlins) and had noticed that my parents just suddenly stopped moving the Elf in the mornings. It was obviously making my three younger siblings sad that the Elf didn’t like them enough to report back to Santa. I brought it up to my mother and she told me that I should do the moving around if it bothered me so much. So I did. The first night was simple, I just hid the Elf in the tree. The kids were so excited that the Elf was on the move again. The second night I got a bit more advantageous, and set up my other siblings toys around the livingroom with them to make it pretty hard to get through without moving them around. The third night was when I struck, I covered the entire kitchen in flower. I made it look like the Elf was having a snow ball fight around the kitchen with my brothers army men dolls. My mother was shocked, but couldn’t be mad as it was the Elf! Not me. And I knew she would have to clean it up to do literally anything while we were at school. \n\nNeedless to say I got put off of Elf duty. \nLet kids be kids man.",

        "text": "So this is another one of those stories where the manager on a power trip decides to ignore the team and then doesn't like the outcome.\n\nRecently in my organization, there were policy changes which removed our shift timings to get shoft allowance (no big deal, that was just 3hrs pay worth a month, and we had good timings). We were also made elegible to get overtime pay as salaried employees payable at 2× rate. Great, but our manager made it clear that in our team, there will be no overtime and all work will be done in our assigned shift timings. Fine, we barely have enough work to do in our shifts and spend 2-3hrs goofing around daily.\n\nLittle background about my job - i work with a team of 8 people and we have to prepare reports once a month. The reports are due on last day of the month and we get the files for the report on 15th of each month. We have total of 7 monthly reports, 6 of which are small, one person reports, and a big one which needs all to work on it. Usually 6 people work on their assigned 6 reports and 2 people work on the big report for first few days, till the rest complete small reports so all can get to the big one. And the process is also defined like that only, that for the first few days, 2 people vet the files, format it, process it etc so after everyone is available, they can just pick their parts and work on that only.\n\nThen, last month, due to some issues on the back end, we get the files for big report at end of the day instead of morning. I ask my manager if he wants me to work ovetime to vet the data and format it correctly now, so it can be processed overnight?\nHe says no one will do overtime, you will have to do it tomorrow.  I try to explain that if the data isn't processed overnight, we will be delayed by a day and it will take me only 3 hrs to do and I'll be happy to do that. But he's sticking to his word and denies overtime.\n\nCue MC, i leave the files right there and log off, next morning i start working on it, complete the tasks and send it for processing, which took the whole day and now we are one day behind.\nOnce everyone else is done with their reports, they all get a free day because they can't do anything till our task is complete and final data is available. \n\nSince we were a day behind, all 8 people had to work on a Saturday. The manager was fine with it because as per old policy, we could work on a Saturday and get a day off after the reports are submitted. \n\nWe all are fine with it because we read the new policy correctly and we know that working on weekend will not only give an additional day off, we will be getting overtime pay for that as well.\n\nSo instead of letting me work 3 hrs of overtime, he had to make 8 people work 9 hrs of overtime and give them a day off later as well.",

We helped people with their machines, answered questions, paid jackpots, and were a huge customer impact point. It was a really fun job, despite the awful customers, and many years later I'm still friends with my old co-workers.\n\n\nOne day management had the bright idea to mandate smiling, even if we weren't physically interacting with customers. Surveillance had been engaged to photograph and report incidences of employees not smiling. We could be written up or even terminated if we had sufficient repeat offences of failing to smile.\n\n\nDuring normal business, we would radio surveillance to report tips or found money (any cash that wasn't staying with the casino), or when we accessed the secure machine base for coins (pre-automated tickets), or a select few other reasons. \n\n\nWe started calling them on the radio to verify a smile, or report a potential violation of the new smiling policy. We would warn the co-worker first, that way they could have a huge fake smile ready for the camera.\n\n \"*Uhh...slots to The Eagle...can you verify a potential violation of the smile policy? There's a group of 3 standing near (slot bank location). I can't see smiles from my location.*\"  \n\nThe potential violation had to be recorded, the picture printed, and signed by managers. \n\n\nThe policy ended after a few weeks. Surveillance complained to the gaming board that they couldn't enforce the new policy and protect the casinos asserts. An \"eye in the sky\" buddy said, off the record, they had been buried in dozens of smile violations each shift and it actually affected the property security. \n\n\nManagers couldn't do anything to us, either, to stop us from reporting it.  It was specifically written it was an expectation of our job to report suspected department and property policy violations for documentation and investigation. Because they'd made it a written policy, if they told us to stop calling surveillance, they'd be asking us to violate policy, which would then warrant an investigation.",

She wasted more time debating it than it would have taken to just fill the cup.\n\n“Fine, cancel my order.”  I then got in my car and went through the drive-thru, ordering just the drink.  I had the satisfaction of watching her pull a fresh cup, fill it, and hand it to me, glowering all the while.  I then headed across the street to order a burger from their competitor.\n\nI filed a complaint with corporate.  After a couple of weeks, I tried placing a to go order, just to see what would happen.  The drink came filled.\n\n(Yeah, I know she could have spit in my drink, but that’s why I made sure I was able to watch her fill it.  She wasn’t at the counter when I made my second trip, so I felt pretty safe.  And I generally avoided doing business with them from then on.)",

        "text": "I am involved with a number of charities and this happened about 20 years ago when a scout group i was helping at were given a grant to replace their old hq and bought a property in the middle of town.\n\nMoney was very tight and the 'new' building needed a lot of work doing to it, so we scrounged whatever we could (example a local factory was being demolished and the owners allowed us to strip out things like lights and toilet fittings etc.)\n\nI had a school refurbishment contract going on at the time and there were a number of things being scrapped which would be useful in doing up the hq such as nearly new fire doors, gas heaters etc. (this was a refurb so although the stuff was being ripped out there wasn't actually anything wrong with it). I asked the main contractor if I could have the items and he was okay with it. He'd carefully remove them and make sure they weren't damaged, leave them outside the back of the site and I could load them into my van and trailer.\n\nEnter the contract supervisor: if the stuff is being removed and not scrapped there must be some value in it and the school should be given a chance to sell it so we can't just take it away. We all knew it was complete BS but apparently just removing the stuff doesn't automatically make it the contractor's property? Contractor asks when does it become his and is told when it goes in the scrap skip. Okay, everything must go in the skip? Right!\n\nThe next day I turned up with van and trailer. Contractor carefully removed the items I wanted, carefully carried them out the back and carefully placed them into the skip. Me and mate then carefully lifted same items out of the skip and put them in the trailer, took them to the new hq and fitted them where needed. Honour was satisfied!",
