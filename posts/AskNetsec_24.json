        "text": "Hi, I was looking into building vulnerable VMs for a CTF I was doing, and I was having trouble finding resources. From what I understand, you fully patch a system, and then work backwards from there, and it seems logical, but I wanted to also get some other insight if possible.\n\nAlso, what are some good vectors that are not commonly intuitive to make a VM harder to crack? So far I have restricting shell access, duping users into believing it is an IIS server vs Apache server, etc.\n\nI was thinking of having \"possible\" vulnerable systems, but actually applying the fix and making it look like it was vulnerable, but it actually isn't.",

Or should I wait and try to save up for the SANS mobile security course one day?\n\n2) I'm a recent college graduate from a highly ranked/well known computer Science school with a CS bachelors degree. I'm very comfortable with programming in multiple languages. With security, I took my college's computer security course and an experimental pen test course they ran. The intro computer security course was almost entirely conceptual with hardly any hands on experience (syllabus is here if anyone is interested:  http://www-inst.cs.berkeley.edu/~cs161/sp18/) \n\nThe pen testing course was basically just finding bug bounties on your own, and I focused almost entirely on iOS pen testing as it's what I'm most interested in.

In the server hello message, does the server send some DH parameters (or something else?) that is signed using the server's RSA certificate?\n\nCheers,\nS",

I was interviewed by three people, I was pretty much asked a lot of technical questions from the IT Sec Director, a person that was over speaker phone, there was also the CIO which personality was laid back and cool.  Questions asked: What's the difference between false negative and false positive, what type of vpn used to remote into another site, what command is used for a routing table on an endpoint, what would make a good cyber security professional, what SIEM tools I've used, what commands used to troubleshoot network connectivity issues, what does the tcp flag mean in wireshark, even asking me version numbers of nmap and kali linux, how many levels are in syslog, etc.  It's hard to recollect and convey while on the spot and I think I stumbled on about three questions but I did my best.  I showed them printouts of my paper that was published and two pen test reports I did in my Master's program which they wanted to keep and I think they liked.  We'll see how it goes.  Tomorrow is another interview this time with the state.",

I usually open up BurpSuite, map out the site, try to find exploits, etc.\n\nHowever, every once in a while, I'll run into an \"embedded\" application. By that I mean applications that you can't use \"inspect element\" on, because they use Flash or Java or HTML5 or whatever. These are mostly online games, like oldschool runescape, the .io games, online poker, etc. I'm most interested in online gambling, because vulnerabilities in those have a much higher impact.\n\nHow do I detect what technology is used in the \"embedded\" application if I can't use \"inspect element\"? Have I understood correctly that these days, most applications use HTML5? \n\nI'd like to know how these applications are pentested. I know that Java and Flash can be decompiled. Can I view the HTML5 application's code directly somehow? What about data sent over the network? Is Wireshark the best or are there other options?",

I talked with a friend of mine and this is what came out, very summarized:\n\n&gt;me: What's the deal with Whatsapp e2e encryption? Why can we trust it?  \nfriend: The problem with that mainly concerns the unknown algorithm responsible for key generation. Telegram is more secure because it is open source and you can be sure they are not doing sketchy things.  \nme: Yes but, if you program your Diffie\\-Hellman client you are sure you are using the key. What guarantee do we have that whatsapp actually uses the key they used to generated the qr\\-code?  \nfriend: The guarantees are exactly the things explained in the [white\\-paper on their site](https://www.whatsapp.com/security/WhatsApp-Security-Whitepaper.pdf).  \nme: I know but how do we tell if they actually enforce the encryption and the key displayed is not just a made up story?  \nfriend: If they didn't use any encrpytion we would have noticed by now, by sniffing network traffic.  \nme: I'm not saying they are not using encryption at all. They are certainly using a secure connection client\\-server and server\\-client, but how do we know that this second layer that uses this alleged end\\-to\\-end enc. is real?  \nfriend: I guess we just have to trust them on that. They would face gigantic legal consequences if it weren't true. Maybe they submitted their code to a publicly trusted \\(yet discreet\\) committee that is supporting those claims.   \nme: So you just have to trust them or be seen as a consipracy theorist..  \nfriend: Yeah, who knows. Don't forget that, historically, Telegram never gave access to their data/keys \\(example: [April 2018 Russia Ban](http://www.wired.co.uk/article/telegram-in-russia-blocked-web-app-ban-facebook-twitter-google)\\), while Whatsapp never had a problem with governments.\n\nIt was something like that. Sorry for the tedious discussion but it represents my current train of thoughts.\n\nWhat do you think about all this? Can you expand?",

They agree to an acceptable salary, and then lower the salary before they'll agree to sell you to the client for an on-site interview. \n\n* Recruiters with absolutely zero sense of time zones. I tell the recruiter to call me at X time using a very specific time zone.

Essentially, they're working in an overseas call center and cold-calling people whose resumes they've farmed.\n\n* Recruiters requesting 4-5 references prior to even submitting my resume.\n\n* Recruiters who require an NDA to find out who the client is.\n\n* Job descriptions that require me to be an Appsec Engineer, SOC Analyst, DevOps architect, Reverse Engineer expert, etc. Basically 4-5 roles in one.\n\n* Companies/recruiters who very clearly have no idea what they're looking for, and are mixing and matching random buzzwords to nonsensical hilarity.\n\n* Recruiters/companies seeking senior level staff at $60k-$100/y in a high cost of living area.\n\nIt just seems like I'm wading through an absolute shitfest at this time. \n\nAnyone else have this problem? \n\nI'm going to start applying directly to interesting companies instead of letting them come to me.

The downside is that if the database is leaked or hacked a hacker could use brute force or a rainbow table to figure out the passwords. To get around this, you can use a salt the hashes to have it more difficult to brute force the password. The salt is used with the password to form the hash.\n\nSo As I understand it the database would be set up like this.\n\nUsername(key) - Hash(password + salt) - Hash used (randomly generated)\n\nThe problem with this method it is still susceptible to offline hacking.\n\n**My Idea**\n\nWhat if we use the combination of the username and password to create the database index/key.\n\nSo the database would look like this\n\nHash (username + password, key) - Hash1 (salt + password) - hash2 (username + salt) - Salt (randomly generated) -\n\nAt a bonus you can fill the table in the database with random data. If the database is leaked the offline hacking would be virtually impossible.\n\nIf the database gets leaked it would be infeasible to figure out both the username and password. Both the username and password are used to create hashes to make sure false positives do not happen or extremely unlikely to occur.\n\nWhat do you guys think?",

To reiterate, I DO NOT HAVE TIME TO COMMIT TO THE OSCP; I still have classes.\n\nI am working on some web application/cloud stuff, so I have chosen the AWS Associate Architect (cheap, applicable, working on a project that reolves around it).\n\nNetwork+/Security+ are also cheap, but I hear a lot of ups and downs.\n\nThe OSWP interests me because it appears applicable to netowrking with a penetration testing spin on it. Arguably, it's a tad outdated.\n\nThe CEH is too expensive. Period.\n\nNo one had heard of the eJPT, though it fits everything I need it to, penetration testing, hands-on, good price, etc, etc.\n\nWhat would you recommend? Is an AWS, OSWP, Sec+/eJPT not a good lineup for the summer?\n\nCheers",

In doing so I've noticed something odd about the way it connects to other devices. Whenever I access it through the mobile app associated with it over a separate wifi network, it appears to send data directly to the IP address associated with that network. However, when I connect to it over 4G, it transmits data out to a seemingly random IP address each time. This seems a bit questionable to me, as I can't figure out why it would need to send the data out to a random location over 4G when it can connect directly over any wifi network. Besides this, the idea of the camera feed being sent to an device other than my own is concerning in and of itself. Some other information that may be useful:\n\n* The camera supposedly transmits data through P2P somehow, and isn't set up with port forwarding or anything else as far as I'm aware\n\n* The random IP addresses seem to be focused in NA and China\n\n* The only exception to the rule of random IP addresses has been an address that belongs to Alibaba, which it has connected to more than once\n\nDoes this have something to with the way AT&amp;T's cellular network operates, or is it something related to the camera itself? If anyone can shed any light on what may be happening here I would greatly appreciate it.",

These virtual servers, each containing multiple client sites are of course located in our network's DMZ. I am in the process of developing a central management system that can manage/collect data from all of our client systems and what I am trying to do at the moment is list all of the enabled sites (essentially \"ls /etc/apache2/sites-enabled\") per virtual server. The command \"apache2ctl -S\" gives the desired output. This central system is located behind our firewall which means I need to \"ssh user@virtual-server 'apache2ctl -S'\".\n\nI have successfully allowed public key authentication from central to virtual-server and can get the desired output from the terminal.

The people working here think the connection was slow because it was raining 😂 so I said I'd look into it.\n\nUpon first glance, I think the issue could be resolved with an extender to boost the signal. However, I doubt that the speed would be affected much by this. Am I wrong?\n\nCurrently the router is broadcasting two separate wifi signals. One is used daily, the other (the slow/weak one) is used weekly or monthly. They need to be separate and the students can't connect to the daily use one for reasons.\n\nShould I try the booster?
