        "text": "This might sound a bit odd, but after being exposed to many important philosophical issues in the main branches of philosophy, I’ve unintentionally just suspended judgement on basically everything. For example, I recognise that there are different views and arguments for or against internalism and externalism in epistemology, or on the existence of God, but I don’t really have any position. \n\nI think the reasoning goes something like “these issues have been debated for ages. Extremely intelligent and dedicated minds have different opinions. Everytime a new argument emerges, a counter argument is advanced. So there is no hope of ever knowing the truth”. \n\nI’d go as far as to say that the issue extends to issues in science, theology and related disciplines. \n\nHow should someone go about overcoming something like this?",

Note, I understand an essay written 200-years ago, will have a very different style of writing than the modern day essay, but I notice that even modern Philosophy seems to share similar characteristics.\n\nDoes anyone else notice this, and if so, does anyone know why this seems to be the case?",

Surely some things are not good? Or is it only meant in the sense of the grand scheme of things? If that is the case, that is pure optimistic belief, not obvious necessary truth like the other transcendental qualities.

For me philosophy is something I apply my life. Questions regarding to \"mind\" in philosophy for me looks like just \"language\" game, too abstract and also more isolated from \"life\".  I do not know how to continue my academic life anymore.

How many of the 17 million subscribers are American voters looking for an open-minded philosophy forum? \n\n  It seems like those mods are intentionally creating an elitist link portal for ad revenue, with topics closed to the common redditor unless he has a website, and in that case, why do it on Reddit? It seems clear that r/philosophy should be an open discussion of philosophy for redditors, so why support such heavy censorship? Why delete every post that is written on Reddit? Because they are damaging society in exchange for keeping that ad revenue flowing through dated philosophy websites. It's a circle jerk of college grad con artists.\n\n   This is one of the few times I wish Reddit would just wipe the slate clean and start over with new mods.

A 911 operator who dispatches a police officer to a scene is (at least gut instinct) not blameworthy for an event of police brutality. But a higher level officer who may have no direct involvement in the event but nonetheless creates a culture where brutalistic tendencies are normalized probably ought to share some blame.\n\nAlso, I feel that it could be worthwhile to differentiate between those non-direct actors who line up on the (not necessarily literal) production side of a morally blameworthy action (i.e. gun manufacturers' role in mass shootings) versus those who are on the consumption side of a blameworthy action (i.e. meat eaters assuming that violence toward animals is morally wrong.)\n\nI'm not sure I'm even going in the right direction here and would appreciate any answers or an onramp to some philosophers who have attempted to answer this question.\n\nThank you in advance",

        "text": "In brief: Could it be possible that what is thought to be unethical by the scientific community today could actually be unethical over the longer term, by not allowing researchers to run experiments that could cause some suffering at first, but prevent much greater suffering in the future over the long-term, especially if the volunteers are willing to participate in the experiments and compensated?\n\nLonger version: I feel that the harm we are doing with such restrictive ethics is more evil than the harm the occasional dictator dashes out on certain populations. Emphasis on feel, not think, that means I haven’t rigorously tested my intuitions yet and am open to change my mind in light of convincing reasonable logical arguments or evidence to the contrary, and so I want to know what you all think about it.  \nWhy do I think so? Because we forget that if we take some bold steps and allow a willing researchers and a willing volunteer to participate in experiments designed to test stuff we deem unethical at the time, and allow the experiments to continue without any backlash from morally and emotionally motivated members of the general public who oppose it, by convincing them how it is logically and scientifically the most rational course of action, we could come up with discoveries and innovative cures that could prevent a lot of future suffering.\n\nIf we continue with our current state of knowledge, we would stay ignorant forever unless another sociopathic dictator rises in the future and does it themself, but if we don’t understand these things that require us to extend the acceptable and ethical moral grey area, we would never be able to understand it and even worse prevent suffering that would take place as a result of our ignorance. \n\nIf we conduct some experiments at once, which would have very less amount of individuals suffer (in the grand scheme of things, taking a long-term view) that too if they’re willing to volunteer and compensated for their contribution to Science, then we could prevent a large amount of individuals in the future who could be cured by our new discoveries. Food for thought.  \nThis may also be some sort of general principle that we get to see in theories like how initial suffering pushes some people to give it some sort of meaning by pushing themselves to work for something that is greater than them, as in Frankl’s Logotherapy, and how from my own personal experiences I find that some unfortunate circumstances teach me valuable lessons that prevent many potential future failures and mishaps that would have occurred had I not learned the lesson from my initial mistakes. \n\nThis is also how I came up with the rule to extract general principles from my failures and not just turn it into a learning opportunity but leverage it to achieve my future goals, because everything has pros and cons, and what you consider your misfortune may have some hidden upsides or a silver lining you have failed to detect but might discover if you try to. \n\nBoth these things obey the same sort of vague principle- some initial undesirable or unfortunate event resulted in net positive outcome for the agent going forward in the future, and had the initial unfortunate or undesirable event not taken place, the agent would have suffered much greater loss by not learning the lessons that the event had to teach. \n\nThis might hold true in the case of unethical scientific experiments too, and we’d never know until we try it, and in my opinion the potential risks are much greater than the potential benefits, and the worst case scenario definitely seems to be more undesirable than the best case scenario, so the pros of conducting such experiments overall seem to weight more than the cons, even when compare to the alternatives, and the opportunity cost of not doing so seems to high to be neglected.\n\nI also sometimes think what in our current society is something that the future generations would consider unethical or immoral, and nowadays as I’m realizing the importance of Rationality, I’m thinking what the future generations with much more sophisticated scientific knowledge and tools would consider irrational, and I think what I just discussed could be one of those things.\n\nI'd like to know what you think about this, and if I am mistaken or misunderstood or overlooked some important part of the philosophy of science and ethics, because I admit that I have not studied these subjects too deeply yet, but I'm curious about this and would greatly appreciate if anyone who is knowledgeable in this field could guide me in the right direction.

        "text": "According to philosophers such as [A.J. Ayer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bgaxAggrQg),  the works of Frege and Russell (following on from Boole), in 'fusing' logic with mathematics (i.e. reducing mathematics to logic), resulted in significant changes in the paradigms of both logic and philosophy as a whole:\n\n&gt;'There's a been a change... a change in the main concern of philosophy... in recent years this has given way to what is sometimes called the 'philosophy of logic', which is mainly concerned with questions about meaning... Russell had a very big influence on the \\[later\\] philosophers... he convinced us \\[that\\] since science was sovereign in the description of the world, all that philosophy could do was elucidate and analyse.'\n\nLogic was effectively 'divorced' from psychology (and German idealism at the time) after thousands of years, and considered as an objective science independent of the mind (or psychological processes), just like mathematics. Continuing upon the enormous influence of logic on philosophical discourse, according to [Bertrand Russell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IEYW5wuK3Y&amp;t):\n\n&gt; 'Philosophy consists of speculations where exact knowledge is not yet possible... Science is what we know and philosophy is what we don't know.'\n\nRussell was clear that this was just his own interpretation. However, the general idea I've outlined above is very significant in logic, maths, and philosophy.\n\n* Has modern philosophy effectively become subordinate to science? A means of articulating a kind of pre or proto-hypothesis prior to scientific experimentation? \n\nBy (simple) way of analogy, it seems Aristotle developed syllogisms (at least in part) as a means of [testing hypothesis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrDyDQYRUxM) prior to scientific experiments. On that understanding, the influence of modern logic on philosophy makes sense. Is this kind of perspective common amongst modern philosophers?\n\n* Is modern philosophy - being based on mathematical logic - now beyond the reach of laymen?\n\nI didn't get the memo about the enormous influence of mathematic logic on philosophy (hence asking before about its uses other than for computers). I am not aware of this apparent fact even being common knowledge. Logic still seems to be commonly considered in psychological terms by the general public (e.g. critical thinking).\n\n* If logic is not the science of the mind, then what exactly is it the science of? If it exists objectively, then where? How?\n\nI suspect the answer is going to be the same as for mathematics, but I know even less about that than logic.",

There can be classical and non-classical modal logics. Of course ultimately it's just convention, but I think there can be good and bad taxonomies, and this one is very confusing.\n\nClassical or non-classical, in my mind, is about the logical principles that hold in one logic. Where classical logic simply is one that allows a certain list of principles, and non-classical logics depart from this. And of course there can be different 'levels' of classical logic, e.g. classical propositional logic, classical first-order or higher order logic, etc.\n\nModal or non-modal logic, in my mind,  is like additional information to saying \"propositional logic\" or \"first-order logic\", on the same axis. It describes a possible extension of propositional or first-order logic (or higher-order logic) by additional operators, that can be given different interpretations.\n\nThe move from classical propositional logic to the logic that adds 2 modal operators to it (propositional modal logic), is not a move to a non-classical logic any more than the move towards classical first-order logic. It's a different axis, if that makes sense.If we hear \"(non)modal x-order... \", it doesn't tell us anything about classical or non-classical, unless we hear what principles hold in the logic. \n\nAnd of course that's consistent with the fact that there can be a modal version of classical logic as well as a modal version of for example intuitionistic logic. But to look at a modal version of classical propositional logic and call it non-classical seems very confusing and nonsensical to me. Any reason to do it like this?",

        "text": "Sure, here's a reworded version of the original text that aims to improve its readability and interest level:\n\nThe story of Will Smith in the movie \"The Pursuit of Happyness\" is a powerful reminder that we often create our own limitations. We tell ourselves \"I can't\" when faced with challenges, but what we don't realize is that we have the power to change our circumstances. In the movie, Will Smith sought the \"American Dream\" and showed his son that no one should tell them what they can't do. Despite all the reasons why he thought he couldn't succeed, Will Smith persevered and landed the only role in a prestigious firm. He had to sell outdated technology in a cut-throat environment, but he proved that with determination and hard work, anything is possible.\n\nThe message here is that we are responsible for our own lives, and excuses are simply a way of avoiding accountability. To truly be responsible for something, we must want it. Just like an intern seeking a job at a big company, it takes courage, preparation, and a bit of luck. But what employers really want are people who are passionate and committed to the job.\n\nThe idea that everything is connected, from relationships to the stock market, is a fascinating one. The creation of the universe and everything in it can be seen as a series of events that have led us to where we are today. At the very beginning, something was added to the universe and that \"something\" is now a part of everything. We are all made of the same \"something\" and are therefore connected in an indescribable way. From rocks to trees, from black to white, male to female, animal to insect, we are all one.\n\nThe writer's original message about our connection to the universe is an intriguing and thought-provoking one. With a focus on clarity, coherence, and interest, the revised version aims to convey that message in a more engaging and readable way.\n\nHere's a second, more imaginative version that takes the message to a higher level of interest (200/100):\n\nImagine a world where we break free from our self-imposed limitations and embrace our true potential. A world where we shed the excuse-making skin and step into our power as creators of our own lives. Will Smith's story in \"The Pursuit of Happyness\" shows us that this world is not just a pipe dream, it's possible.\n\nWill Smith sought the \"American Dream\" with a passion that wouldn't be quenched by the word \"can't\". He showed his son that nothing is impossible and that we are the only ones who can stop ourselves from reaching our goals. Despite all the reasons why he thought he couldn't succeed, Will Smith proved that determination and hard work can overcome even the most insurmountable odds.\n\nEmployers want people who are passionate about their work, and life is no different. If we truly want something, we must be willing to be responsible for it. Just like an intern seeking a job at a big company, it takes courage, preparation, and a bit of luck. But what life really wants from us is our undivided attention, unwavering commitment, and boundless passion.\n\nThe idea that everything is connected is more than just a concept, it's a cosmic truth. We are all made of the same \"something\" that sparked the universe into existence and that \"something\" is now a part of everything. From rocks to trees, from black to white, male to female, animal to insect, we are all one, and we are all gods' children. So why not step into our power and embrace the limitless",

        "text": " I had just gotten into reading some David Hume when I found this (hopefully not too long) passage interesting:\n\n\". . .Principles taken upon trust, consequences lamely deduced from them. . .these are everywhere to be met with in the systems of the most eminent philosophers, and seem to have drawn disgrace upon philosophy itself.\n\n Nor is there required such profound knowledge to discover the present imperfect condition of the sciences, but even the rabble without doors may, judge from the noise and clamour, which they hear  that all goes not well within. There is nothing which is not the subject of debate, and in which men of learning are not of contrary opinions. The most trivial question escapes not our controversy, and in the most momentous we are not able to give any certain decision. Disputes are multiplied, as if every thing was uncertain; and these disputes are managed with the greatest warmth, as if every thing was certain.\"\n\n This quote from the preface of his treatise on human nature seemed to me an opinion common between the great philosophers of that (roughly characterized) age: Descartes' entire project was (I think I can say) an attempt to do away with scepticism and establish a matrix of undoubtable truths; Kant seems to think that if metaphysics is not able to make any progress, but instead is setting out on dozens of different routes with every thinker and has to go back to the start again and again, then philosophy must be horribly out of the scientific line which it is supposed to pursue, and that someone (himself, notably) ought to put it back on its tracks; and so on. \n\n If I'm not misreading these thinkers and others like them, the lack of certainty on some very important matters and dispute over deceivingly simple subjects seemed to them proof that there was something wrong with the way philosophers had been doing philosophy, and that one should strive for a certain common ground that, once it is established, we won't need to dismantle it anymore. But exceedingly subtle disputes and disagreements are still very much present in philosophy as I know it, if only over (slightly) different matters. \n\n Why does this not seem a great defect to many philosophers? Or does it, without my being aware of it? Am I under a false impression, or did such a change of attitude really occur? Are there any philosophers who are trying to establish something like a second Kantian revolution? Do philosophers today believe there is progress in philosophy, in a significant sense, and not just change? That philosophy is building upon itself?\n\n Thanks for your time.",

Hegel wrote that any philosopher who uses the word \"and\" too often cannot be a good philosopher.\n\nhttps://alumni.media.mit.edu/~cahn/life/gian-carlo-rota-10-lessons.html\n\nExcept there's one problem. I cannot find the source of this sentiment anywhere in Hegel. Wiki quote considers it [link](\"unsourced\"). I've found no quotations that exist before 1996 or don't make reference to Gian-Carlo Rota.\n\nThe closest I can find is in Science of Logic where rather than disparage philosophers who over use conjunctives, he writes in the preface:\n\n&gt;It is the negative, that which constitutes the quality alike of dialectical reason and of understanding; it negates what is simple, thus positing the specific difference of the understanding; it equally resolves it and is thus dialectical.\n\nOr this from the \"Introduction on The Essence of Philosophical Criticism Generally, and its Relationship to the Present State of Philosophy in Particular\"\n\n&gt;Philosophizing piecemeal [das einzelne Philosophieren] has lost all credit, and the possibility of counting for something as a philosopher through a variety of philosophical thoughts upon this or that topic, published perhaps in scholastic treatises, no longer exists. As a result a multitude of systems and principles is arising which gives that part of the public which does philosophy a certain outward similarity to the state of philosophy in Greece, where every prominent philosophical mind elaborated the Idea of philosophy in his own individual way\n\nWhich feels like a reeeeeeally big stretch to reduce it to the far more pithy: good philosophers don't use \"and\" too often\n\nI've even tried to translate \"the word and\" into German \"wort \"und\"\" and Italian and yet that has not delivered any results of a comparable sentiment. No success\n\nOf course I'm very open to the possibility that it wasn't Hegel at all who wrote this, or that it has been so liberally translated from the Original German as to have no resemblance.

        "text": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wanted to ask this question to people who are familiar with the philosophy of religion. I always tell people if they could answer me this question I will become religious or at least consider the stories told in religious scripture more. This question, however, is so complex that I believe I am lacking the necessary eloquence to even formulate it correctly, so I do not expect a clear and definite answer for sure. I see this more as an opportunity to initiate a discussion because this problem is really bothering me. I know this question might have been formed in one form or another on this subreddit before, but I believe it might be the most important question when it comes to discussing the existence of a supernatural being that is concerned about humans.\n\nMy fundamental problem with religion is that to me it all seems anthropocentric. This is mostly present in the Abrahamic philosophy of humans being made in God´s image and the entirety of existence revolving around human free will and how we will go to heaven or not. The entirety of the universe seems to have been created to set the stage for Jesus´ sacrifice for humans alone. We, humans, are the \"pride of creation\", that around which everything else revolves around.\n\nBut something about this always bugged me. I could understand religion´s role as providing moral guidance for society, that was a view that I could get along with. And I also understood that we humans have a limited capacity to understand the entirety of existence and that we sometimes need religious thought in order to not be overwhelmed by the sometimes cruel and careless nature of the world. And I knew that science had yet not found the answer to everything.\n\nHowever, all these arguments for human religion just seem to fall apart for me ever since I started to become interested in astronomy and biology. I began to consider the true implications of the Copernican Revolutions, which just shattered even the best arguments for a deity/deities that care about humans for me. I learned about the sheer magnitude of the universe. Of the 100 billion galaxies in our observable universe, I learned that most stars in these galaxies have planets, billions of them in our Milky Way alone. I learned how many of these planets could possibly be situated in conditions that could be considered liveable. Not to speak of the potential for life on countless exomoons circling those planets. I learned about the sheer timescales of evolution and how it took over 4 billion years of evolution on Earth until humans arose. It is said that Homo Sapiens has existed for only **0.007%** of the entire history of the planet. Over 99% of all species that came before humans went extinct. It took until a billion years ago for multicellular organisms to arise, and the Cambrian Explosion happened only about 500 million years ago, meaning that almost 4 billion years had passed before life really started to thrive on Earth. The entire age of the dinosaurs was so long that Tyrannosaurus Rex existed during a time closer to us than to Stegosaurus. And even during the time that mammals became dominant compared to other lifeforms, from about 60 million years ago until today, it took so long until even bipedal hominids evolved, only until about 2 million years ago. Human history, which is at most 10.000 years old since the Agricultural Revolution, pales in comparison to this. And the universe itself is 13.8 billion years old, meaning almost 10 billion years went by before our solar system was even created. During that time, countless stars were born only to then perish in supernovas, and civilizations with consciousness might have arisen and then perished again, which brings me to my next topic.\n\nGiven that there are so many planets and stars out there, it seems logical that humans are not alone in the universe from a mathematical standpoint alone. Yes, I have heard of the Drake equation, and though I believe it is inadequate and does not take many important factors into account, I still understand the fundamental logic of it. I have learned about the Great Filter and all theories associated with it as well. Given that we are limited in our communication by the speed of light also makes it hard to find such life. As an example, let´s say there was an intelligent civilization that existed a million years ago in the Andromeda Galaxy but then went extinct after 10.000 years. We would have no possibility of even knowing by now as the Andromeda Galaxy is 2 million light years away from us. And who knows how long our highly sophisticated civilization capable of detecting such intelligent beings out there might even exist? How long until we become extinct? I could go on and on about the scale of the universe and humanity´s insignificance in this enormity, quote Carl Sagan and whatnot, but I believe you start to understand where I am getting at.\n\nI want to know how the philosophy of religion approaches this fundamental problem of anthropocentrism in a universe that is clearly not putting humans at the center stage of everything. I just would like to hear the opinions of people in general so I can be inspired and find at least partial answers to the many questions I have. I know some people might answer that what makes us special is consciousness and I would agree, but then it seems unlikely to me that we are the only lifeform to have ever developed consciousness. People will mention the fine-tuning of the universe, but then again, how do we know the fine-tuning was not also intended for all the other lifeforms that might exist in the cosmos? But that is a topic for an entirely different Reddit post. In fact, most of the things I just barely touched upon would make the subject of a plethora of Reddit posts. I would just love to hear the opinions of members of this community on the conundrum posed by such a vast universe and humanity´s insignificance in it, and how this can be reconciled with religions and philosophies that put humans at the center of everything. I am looking forward to the answers!",

What my professor was arguing is that what Sartre is saying is that nothing is stopping you from doing anything and used the example of jumping off a cliff. I agree that most people have had the thought when standing at a cliff side, \"what if I jumped?\" And he says as much, but he goes on to say that, if existentialism were right, then that would mean that human behavior is random, and thus the ratio of people jumping off a cliff vs not jumping off a cliff would be 1:1. I objected but he kept going back to his examples(there were more but I'm boiling it down to what I understand is his stance). Isn't this misunderstanding a fundamental piece of Sartre's philosophy?

        "text": "I keep hearing prominent philosophers such as Sam Harris and his crew talk about reducing suffering as being the core of ethical behavior.  Where they fall on the spectrum (just human suffering? animal suffering? all sentient life suffering?) seems to be up for debate, but every philosopher he interviews generally uses the utilitarian suffering reduction model.   \n\n\nWhat alternatives are out there?    \n\n\nI do not buy this idea at all.  Maybe it's because I was raised Catholic or maybe its just because I love Fight Club or maybe it's because I was at Boot Camp with the USMC.  But whatever the source, I have come to believe that suffering in many cases is a moral good.  It serves an important biological function and is something to be confronted, felt and overcome, not avoided.  I feel like ethics that start out this way are simply wrong headed and will lead us to a dystopia where everyone is on some kind of digital stimulating chip that simply turns off the biological ability to suffer on demand, which chip you could put into any living thing.  Basically make us all prey animals.  Have you ever seen the videos of a gazelle that is just calmly laying there, still alive, not struggling, as it is eaten by a lion?  I don't know about you, but I do not want a humanity that functions this way.  \n\n\nFor me, ethical behavior is a purely human concern (what is \"ethical\" for a deer would not be remotely the same as what is \"ethical\" for a person).  And that it is focused on increasing the density of the consciousness we experience and getting us off this solar system.  Like, in the aggregate, those activities most likely to help us achieve interstellar colonization (the thing we can accomplish that no other life on earth is even aware of as a concept for long term preservation of life) are the ones we should drive all human behavior towards.  Like our species is Noah, and science has told us the flood is coming without giving us an exact date.  So there is a sort of doomsday clock countdown, but we do not know when the countdown will be complete, so we need to act with urgency.  From there, you can derive all manner of behavioral and social goals to achieve, and from there, all manner of steps you need to take to achieve it with maximum efficiency.  That many people or many baby cows or many robots may suffer on the way to that state is just a fact with no moral significance at all.  \n\n\nWhat is the moral philosophy around ideas like mine? Im sure Im not inventing something new here.",

In recent years I have heard many science fiction nerds object to this usage. They insist that we should use _sapient_ to mean \"possessing human-level intelligence\", whereas _sentient_ is a broader term meaning \"able to perceive and experience stuff\". \n\nIs this terminology generally accepted in any field? Does this terminology come from any respectable source, or is it merely the opinions of a few science fiction nerds (akin to those annoying fantasy nerds that whine about the distinction between dragons and wyverns)? \n\nI remember that Daniel Dennett's book _Kinds of Minds_ used the term _sentient_ to mean \"able to experience stuff\". Dennett argued that the concept is ill-formed. His book never uses _sapient_.\n\n(In the above I do not meant to imply that \"nerds\" are necessarily bad or wrong or annoying. I am a nerd.

        "text": "In American society, our morality is based on the paradigm of individualism. Milton Friedman summed up it nicely: \"Society runs on individuals pursuing their separate interests.\" It is upon this paradigm that we judge how right or wrong an action is.\n\nNow, in order for individuals to be able to pursue their separate interests, we must collectively agree to attribute meaning to things that otherwise do not have inherent meaning. Take the colors green, yellow, and red. In themselves, they mean nothing. We assign them meanings when they are lights on the road. Green means go, yellow means slow down, red means stop. If you drive, you agree to accept these meanings. But again, there is nothing inherent to these colors that would make them mean that. We could have just as easily chosen any other color. But we collectively agree on these three.\n\nWithout these conventions, there would be chaos on the roads. There are millions of car accidents every year, and that is with all of our rules in place. Imagine if there were none! Why is this bad? Because I could not meet my goals and you could not meet yours. And if, based on our paradigm, we want to maximize individual freedom, we must collectively agree on mutually beneficial rules. These rules that we agree upon are what we call morality.\n\nTherefore, what is moral wholly depends on how one defines society and what is most beneficial for society. In Friedman's definition, an individual pursuing his own interest is the foundation of society, and so what is moral is that which allows individuals the most freedom. But other societies may be built on different definitions of society, and have different ideas of what is beneficial for it. If this is the case, then what is moral must necessarily change.\n\nSuppose we see a society that rounds up Jews and exterminates them. If we say that it is wrong, what we're really saying is that it does not conform to our societal norms. Before we could say that that society should not be doing that, we must first prove that that society should operate the same way as ours. And even before we do that, we must prove that there is any reason whatsoever that all societies should function in the same way.\n\nBut why should all societies operate the same way, when there is nothing inherently good about any society? We call things good insofar as they align with our collectively agreed upon paradigm. But if they have a different paradigm, then there is no way to argue which is better, just as there is no way to argue that green inherently means go.\n\nWe could attempt to argue that their society would be better if they did not exterminate Jews, but by \"better\" we would only mean it would more closely mirror ours. But again, there is no way to prove that our societal norms should supersede theirs. In order to show that our societal paradigm is better, there must be a higher law to which all men are accountable, and we could judge each society's norms based on that. But if there is no God, no such higher law exists, and thus there is no basis upon which we can say one society is better than another.",

This is an idea I’ve been mulling over personally—that my own life and the lives of others would be improved if I worked in a framework of kindness even when it’s not easy or “deserved.” I’d love to explore texts that touch on this theme, even if they don’t come to the same conclusion as me. Some examples of what I’m envisioning when radical kindness is put into practice: smiling at strangers and showing compassion to people who are behaving poorly, giving compliments freely—especially to people who aren’t expecting it, dedicating income and time to activities and organizations that are pro-social. These are of course small-scale examples, and I’d love to explore philosophies that bring this idea into a broader context. \n\nI saw a producer of Blue’s Clues wrote a book along these lines, but I’d love to check out more academic examples, even if it’s only a small section of a larger work. Arguments for and against this idea could be interesting too. Thanks in advance!",

I was born, parents, friends, and country cultures taught the rest. Let me expand. Had I been born in middle east, I would believe Muslim. Had I been born to Mormons, I would believe Mormonism. Had I been born to Jewish parents, I would believe Judaism etc.\n\ni was born in America. Taught soda is good, hot dogs are food, and the newest phone brings happiness? I was taught Catholic and that religion has changed, been modified to fit the current narrative. I don't believe in it. I feel all religion is more control than faith, and how do you really know if one is right?. I feel it is impossible as all proof, writings etc are made from persons before repeating what they heard from someone else.\n\nIf all you know is what you have been taught, passed down to you, from word of mouth, how do you know who to believe?\n\nWhen I start a new day in practice knowing nothing and let my experiences during the day teach me. This is also faulted as I live here and it's different than over there. What I learn is affected by my surroundings in the present moment.\n\nI have traveled, I have served in the military, been exposed to numerous cultures and beliefs. I choose to believe nothing as I cant prove anything I'm spiritually taught.\n\nYou die. Period. Nobody KNOWS what happens after. We have beliefs, we have hopes, but how can you really KNOW?\n\nWhat I do know is treating someone with kindness feels better than being mean. Sharing a meal makes it taste better than eating alone, feeling love feels better than hate. Sometimes I think if we dropped all beliefs we don't really know, and just feel what is honestly good, everyone would love one another as we are truly all equal and we will all die.\n\nBorn the same way, and will die. Sounds bad, but still gives you the day to make someone smile, share your harvest, share your kindness because I don't think we have anything else except our imagination that manifests these various beliefs that divide us rather than unite.\n\nOne can feed two, two can feed four, four can feed a village, and why would you not want to?
