        "title": "Was I Really Abusing Caffeine? An Over-Dramatic Story",

        "text": "I had an interesting experience with hitting coffee during my freshman year at university (on-campus). During my first semester, I had 18 credit hours (full time and a half for some places). This entailed having laboratory sessions in the evening, so I had less than convenient time to study. With my substandard time management, I was lucky to get 7 hours of sleep. \n\nWhile I remembered a Star Bucks user in high school who would get, in her words, \"migraines\", when she does not have her coffee. I was aware of the mild psychical dependency of caffeine. However, I was tired one morning and gave some black cafeteria coffee a try (I could not find the name, but it may have a cheap Dominican or Puerto Rican brand). The paper cups were roughly 500 mL but I had 350 mL of coffee and I would put vanilla ice cream since it functions as ice, milk, and sugar all in one. I wanted to drink coffee faster than I drink water to get energy as soon as possible at the highest affect as possible.\n\nI liked the stimulation from caffeine. I noticed it took 45-60 minutes for caffeine to kick in, the 6 hour half life, and stronger urination, and felt cool upon reading that pharmacology information on Wikipedia confirming my experiences. Upon using it in the evening, I felt a good mood that somewhat took the edge off of my dread (was not fantasying on the consequences of struggling in my courses as much). I read this could be because dopamine is not re-absorbed as fast as without caffeine. This is  inducing dopamine flow like in addictive drugs. I like being stimulated and do \"stimming\", as a mildly autistic person, so that could be that another to peruse this stimulation. I was beginning to drink to be in a good mood. I was drinking 350 mL of black coffee almost every day. Do you agree with my assessment that I was abusing black coffee?\n\nHowever, I developed a tolerance level, in which I was aware from watching *SciShow* on YouTube, but I was surprised it developed in matter of days instead of weeks. I began to increasing my dose to 500 mL (without ice cream; I got used to the asphalt taste). However, later, I was drinking the stuff to just barley remain awake and it no longer gets in a positive mood. Granted, the coffee use reduced my sleep on week days to be 5-6 hours at the time. As a result, I increased the dose to 600-700 mL a day (the cups were reduced to 350 mL so about two big cups a day AT MOST).\n\nI realised that I was not better off from this large caffeine consumption than prior to ever drinking it consistently. That and with the frequent urination (caffeine is 100% excreted in urine), coffee was a net negative, at this point. I also realised that perusing the stimulation is similar to how people with actual addictions \"chase the dragon\" and \"want to get high\". I decided to no longer drink coffee in any consistent basis. I had minor headaches on the weekend but it was just being tired all day and nothing like withdrawals and cravings. I thought, if caffeine was slightly inconvenient, it must real, real tough to quit actually addictive drugs. Hence, why I would never pick up an addictive drug or even booze.\n\nAfterwards, I would only have coffee once or twice a week at most, but I gave that up, upon getting better time management for sleep. I would have low caffeine energy drinks when I worked on retail jobs on my breaks from schooling. Recently, I would only have a single 200 mL dose (maximum) every other week.\n\nI can assure that I am not (ex)Mormon or anything of the sort. I joke that my over-dramatic telling would be fitting for a Mormon stage play.",

        "text": "So to begin with I'm just curious of anyones take on what happened here. So feel free to drop a comment/suggestion of what you think is the cause or issue?  I'm adding photos as well. One is of the same coffee but different roast dates, with the left coffee being the older one with no issues and the one on the right being the recent coffee I've been having trouble with. The other photo is just the coffee Im having trouble with.\n\nNote: Originally I assumed it had to be user error or this coffee is an outlier but now I have no clue what the issue was. Maybe something went wrong with the coffee during storage at this time, or the roast was done wrong (which I cannot tell from looking at but I will post photos of the coffee I'm having trouble brewing and the same coffee from a month before which does not have these issues), or possibly an issue with the roaster itself at this time. So please any advice or help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nSo, there's a roaster in New York (where I live) who I am a huge fan of. They have several amazing naturals they roast that have a great fruity flavor. But I bought one recently that I have been having massive trouble brewing. I use a plastic V60, brown filters, brew 20 grams and 1:15-1:16 ratio. Best time I found on this coffee specifically is usually around 2:45-2:55.  I have a niche grinder and typical grind for this brew set up is between 37 and 42 on the dial.\n\nThis coffee though at around that grind originally came to approximately 2:00 and it tasted weak. I ended up having to go to 23 on the Niche to get this coffee to brew at 2:30 and even then it had that fruity note but it was very harsh/sharp if you understand what I mean. Also in feeling the ground coffee at 23 it is a lot finer than I have ever used for a pour over.\n\nOriginally i thought the issue might be the grinder and I took it a part, cleaned it and recalibrated the Niche, but nothing changed. \n\nJust want to step back a second and provide as much information as possible for anyone to help limit any questions of factors. So the coffee was roasted on February 21st, my first brewing of this coffee was on March 4th until today March 11th. Also, I'm using boiling water -  212 degrees F.\n\nSo now today Im having the same issues again with this coffee and ended up giving up and brewing a different coffee from another local roaster. That different coffee followed the usual patterns including the typical grind dial that I usually use which suggests to me that theres something off with this natural coffee. Further, in thinking over what happened, I swore I had enjoyed this coffee before without these issues. Ended up going through my little stash of older bags that barely have any coffee left and turns out I have this same coffee roasted from January 16th. \n\nI brewed that coffee under my usual guidelines but just a little finer at 38, and it worked pretty well. Tastes a lot better than this new coffee.\n\nSo if anyone knows what happened? Why would the same coffee, thats supposed to be roasted pretty much the same have a such massive changes to it. I'm very consistent with my brewing, grind sizes, amount of water, etc. so this shouldn't factor in. If anyone knows or has an idea/suggestion  please let me know. Also, if anyone notices any differences in the coffees from the photos please drop a comment since I don't see anything OTHER THEN THE MORE RECENT COFFEE CAUSING ME TROUBLE TO BE A LITTLE DARKER ROASTED.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/11o6e1s/caffeine_is_handicapping_me/",
        "text": "Hello! I‚Äôd like to share my experiences with caffeine for two reasons: I want to see if anyone can relate to what I‚Äôm going through, and I want to make a commitment to finally ween off it for good. Thank you for letting me be vulnerable here.\n\nHere‚Äôs some context: I (M/41) have been drinking caffeine from high school (soda) to college (energy drinks) to career (coffee) and onward ‚Ä¶ while I‚Äôve never been a binge caffeine person (I don‚Äôt think), I do think I often push the limits of my tolerance.\n\nAt the height of my caffeine consumption (single life/20-30s), I would probably have a latte in the morning, energy drink in the afternoon and a soda at night. I‚Äôve never downed 8 Mountain Dews in a sitting or taken caffeine pills ‚Ä¶. nothing that extreme. BUT it was still far too much caffeine to regularly intake, and it wasn‚Äôt healthy.\n\nNow? I think caffeine is handicapping me. It‚Äôs preventing me from living a full life ‚Ä¶ a life I know I can lead. A life I want to lead. One where I‚Äôm an A+ version of myself every day. I know this because when I‚Äôve cycled off caffeine from time to time (sometimes days, a few times months), it felt ‚Ä¶ well, heavenly. Clarity, communication skills, confidence ‚Ä¶ it all improved, like a miracle drug. Night and day. Total light switch of change. I‚Äôm lucid. I‚Äôm calm. I‚Äôm truly, actually living, not encumbered or rushed or anxious or edgy. It‚Äôs like walking on clouds. It‚Äôs the best life I can live. A+.\n\nThe easy solution to living that life is to quit caffeine for good. I know. I also know I‚Äôm staring at the Willy Wonka of golden ticket solutions right in the face ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs so easy to do, to hop on that new path whenever I want to, that I just keep doing it. Because I can get on that path whenever. Because I would just stop having caffeine. Simple. But that‚Äôs the addiction speaking.\n\nHow does caffeine make me feel? It used to be that nine times out of 10 it made me feel supremely awesome ‚Ä¶ the energy, the focus, the rush of life coursing through my veins. Now, after years and years of having it daily? It makes me feel edgy, rushed, irritable, physically meh nine times out of 10. It went from an asset to a liability. I feel like a shell of myself more often than not, where all my good qualities are suffocated and stamped down, replaced by my bad ones.\n\nHere‚Äôs the thing, and I don‚Äôt know if this is unique to me or if I‚Äôve developed a caffeine intolerance/allergy: Caffeine makes me feel hazy. Brainwashed. Outside of my brain like a bad high. It makes me feel like I‚Äôm three steps from reality. A horse with blinders on the entire day. Singularly focused. Always rough around the edges mentally. Fog. It feels like I‚Äôm living just 60% (handicapped), and the other 40% of my mind is occupied by a caffeine overtake.\n\nHere‚Äôs what my day is typically like: I feel like I got hit by a truck when I wake up. I‚Äôm often irritable, rushed, anxious to get going. I drive to my coffee shop and get a latte and large drip coffee. I drink the latte while in my car listening to sports radio, settling into the day. Then I go home, start working at my desk and have the drip coffee until it‚Äôs gone. Then, 50% of the time, I reach for a Bai (or a similar 50mg-ish drink) in the afternoon, or I don‚Äôt. And that‚Äôs all the caffeine I‚Äôll have. Probably 300mg total? Not a ton, but it‚Äôs enough to make me feel like the above.\n\nSo, why do I have caffeine since it so clearly crushes me? Because it‚Äôs an addiction. A habit I‚Äôve compounded over years. Because I like having something warm to drink in the morning and while working. Because it gives me a jolt I need to get moving in the a.m. Because it‚Äôs the only real thing I do to treat myself. Because it makes me feel like an adult. Because it helps me power through days‚Äô worth of work in a matter of hours, and because I equate my value at work with being productive, and in my mind, I wrongly think I can‚Äôt be as successful at my job without the cruise control caffeine provides. It‚Äôs become a psychological crutch.\n\nBut none of that matters. Because I need to stop for good. To live a better life. To be healthier. To be a better husband, father, brother, friend and person. Because I know the best version of me is just days away. Because I‚Äôm tired of feeling like I‚Äôm living my life 40% and that caffeine owns and occupies the other 60%. Because every day blurs together. Because I want to be more present and watch my kids grow up and eek every last second out of my life. Because I want to be consistently calm, exponentially more articulate and always patient. Because I saw what life is like on the other side of the caffeine corridor. Because I need to.\n\nThanks for reading. I‚Äôve never done drugs, and I hesitate to compare (although, I guess caffeine is, technically, a drug), but I‚Äôve got to think this reliance on caffeine must be in the ballpark of what other addictions might be like? In which case, much love to all.\n\nDo these experiences resonate with you, or is this a uniquely weird me thing? Does caffeine make you feel like a zombie?\n\nSide note: I‚Äôve managed to almost completely stop drinking alcohol, having sugar and eating fast food ‚Ä¶ which I‚Äôm super surprised I was able to do! Now, if anything, I have one Coors Light a month, maybe a cookie every few weeks and one fast food burger a month, if that. That gives me hope that I can go from being controlled by caffeine to being so far removed from daily consumption that a coffee every few weeks is more than enough.\n\nI hope this post is the first step of a new me. Thank you!",

        "text": "Hello everyone,\n\nI've never used a coffee machine in my life before and a friend bought a new machine and gifted me his Saeco Via Venezia Espresso coffee machine.\n\nI was using it at his place everyday for the last 2 weeks and everything was working perfectly. The moment I took it home I'm having issues with it. The part where the coffee comes out is leaking water and when I go to turn the milk frother on the part where the coffee comes out lets out a LOT of constant steam and makes a sizzling noise and the machine gets VERY hot. I'm worried it might start a fire.\n\nWhen I moved it I forgot to empty the water and the water did leak from the machine during transportation but when I got home I took it apart and dried it but it's still happening.\n\nAny ideas what it could be and what can I do to fix it? Also is it a fire hazard?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y251pmyk50na1.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=100734433a28247477eb2533483464916581dea7",

        "text": "So I had this thought in another thread and I was wondering if anyone else had an opinion: Could you store ground coffee in a slurry to prevent it from going stale/oxidising?\n\nImagine you grind 20 grams of coffee to brew 48 hours later. Usually it would lose quite a bit of flavour by the time you brewed it. But what if you added just enough water (let's say another 20 grams) to fully saturate and cover it, like a 1:1 cold brew. And suppose you then brewed with that slurry instead of the stale powdered coffee, adjusting your brew ration and temperature accordingly. Would that produce a better result?\n\nI want to say that it could work, though I've never tried it. I know heating cold brew doesn't produce fresh coffee flavours, but I've never tried heating it up with the ground coffee still mixed in. Thoughts?",

Ceremony has been my go-to (ordering from them 75% of the time)- but I'm a little disappointed they don't have re-sealable bags for their 2lbs. I also prefer single origins, so it's been good to try various ones from Ceremony.\n\nCurious what you guys recommend! I've read on here that B&amp;W is good, but haven't tried them yet.

        "text": "**Story**\n\nI purchased the titled makers around 11 months ago, and it's mostly worked fine. I originally bought it as part of me stopping to drink diet soda/artificial sweeteners.  I liked the idea of being able to make iced tea (caffeine) and coffee.  Meaning I wasn't ready to give up having caffeine.  My goal was to eventually reduce my caffeine intake also.\n\nAt any rate, it's worked pretty well for me, I fumbled around a bit trying to find a ground coffee I liked. I was coming from quite a few years of a Keurig machine.  I had used GMC Columbian select as my main k-pod, and with the new machine ended up using Starbucks Columbian ground.  \n\nI tried the gold metal filter but it let too much sediment through so I bought some Melitta #4 filters, and have been using them since.\n\n**Problem**\n\nFFW to about a month or so ago.  I am having a lot of issues where after the brew cycle, there is a whole cup of coffee left in the filter basket. This is after the 'lift mechanism' closes indicating the cycle is done (aka no more water will go through because it's closed).\n\n**Troubleshooting (not necessarily in order)**\n\n* I have ensured everything is clean.\n* Tried multiple packages of the Starbucks coffee  \n* Tried buying some beans, and grinding them a less fine.  \n* Tried a second box of the Melitta filters.\n* I tried putting the filter on top of the gold filter to give it more space around the basket.\n* Tried Kroger's brand #4 filters.\n\nIt's gone from a nightly routine of plopping in a filter, 3 scoops of coffee, filling the water and hitting delay start to an absolute PITA to just get my coffee.\n\nI tried searching a bit, but didn't see an inherent issue related to this model and filtering coffee, so I'm hoping there is someone else that's faced similar issues and found a fix.  Everything I am seeing is pointing to a FILTERING issue, not a timing/machine issue. If I take the filter basket out, take it over to the sink and open it manually it will drip out a bit of coffee and then it almost stops with most of the water still inside (telling me the filter is clogged).",

But I just had a cup once again today and rode the high, only to tip into this depression again. I'm awake at 4am now and banking on feeling better tomorrow (without coffee)",

Do you think similar updated version will be coming for the DF83?",
