        "text": "Recently, I've been simplifying a Logging class used in our PHP project. So help me if I ever will know why they had to create their own logging class -- they're all long gone, and have been since before I arrived. The whole thing had 492 lines, define()d its own logging levels, and contained the oh so aptly named **public** function\n\n     function evdp( $data) {\n        $search = array( '/\\n/', '/\\/\\//');\n        error_log( preg_replace( $search, '', var_export($data, true)));\n    }\n\nwhich is of course never called outside said class.\n\nMy changes introduced a bug which only showed on prod (of course), so I reverted and took a closer look. I happened (on top of oh my god so many other things) upon this inocuously named little function, consisting of **only** 92 lines. I just HAVE to post the whole sucker, it's such a humungous thing of beauty:\n\n    private function getDbConfig() {\n        global $manual;\n\n        if( $this-&gt;haveConfig === false) {\n            $this-&gt;offline = true;  // set db offline\n\n            $dbF = new DatabaseFactory();\n            $db = $dbF-&gt;getInstance( 'logconfig', $this-&gt;config, false, false, false, true);\n            if( $db-&gt;connected() === false) {\n                if( $db-&gt;onDemandConnect() === FALSE) {\n                    $this-&gt;write( 'log db offline after ondemandconnect for config' . print_r($this-&gt;config, true), 'logging', EMERG);\n                    return;\n                }\n            }\n            # todo - more than 1 db server\n            # SELECT type, backend, server, user, pass, name, table_prefix, persistent, level, search, value~\n            #    FROM log_config WHERE active = 'y' AND offline = 'n';\n            $db-&gt;SELECT( array( 'type', 'backend', 'server', 'user', 'pass', 'name',\n                        'table_prefix', 'persistent', 'level', 'search', 'value'))\n                    -&gt;FROM( 'log_config')\n                    -&gt;WHERE( 'active', '=', 'y')\n                    -&gt;_AND( 'offline', '=', 'n')\n                    -&gt;query();\n            if( $db-&gt;hasError() === true) {\n                $this-&gt;write( 'log db offline, has error', 'logging', EMERG);\n                $this-&gt;offline = true;\n                return;\n            }\n            $log_config = $db-&gt;fetchAssoc();\n            $db-&gt;close();\n            if( $db-&gt;hasError() === true) {\n                $this-&gt;write( 'log db offline, backend fetching has error', 'logging', EMERG);\n                $this-&gt;offline = true;\n                return;\n            }\n            if( count( $log_config) == 0) {\n                $this-&gt;write( 'log db offline, there is no backend configured', 'logging', INFO);\n                $this-&gt;offline = true;\n                return;\n            }\n\n            $config = $log_config[0];\n            if( $config['persistent'] == 'y') {\n                $config['persistent'] = true;\n            } else {\n                $config['persistent'] = false;\n            }\n\n            if(( $config['search'] !== '') &amp;&amp; ( $config['value'] !== '')) {\n                switch( $config['search']) {\n                    case 'TASKID_MANUAL':\n                        $this-&gt;search = TASKID;\n                        $this-&gt;value = $config['value'];\n                        if(( $this-&gt;taskid !== NULL) &amp;&amp; ( $this-&gt;taskid == $this-&gt;value)) {\n                            $this-&gt;level = DEBUG;\n                            $manual = true;\n                        }\n                        break;\n                    case 'TASKID':\n                        $this-&gt;search = TASKID;\n                        $this-&gt;value = $config['value'];\n                        if(( $this-&gt;taskid !== NULL) &amp;&amp; ( $this-&gt;taskid == $this-&gt;value)) {\n                            $this-&gt;level = DEBUG;\n                        }\n                        break;\n                    case 'UNIQUEID_MANUAL':\n                        $this-&gt;search = UNIQUEID_MANUAL;\n                        $this-&gt;value = $config['value'];\n                        if(( $this-&gt;uniqueid !== NULL) &amp;&amp; ( $this-&gt;uniqueid == $this-&gt;value)) {\n                            $this-&gt;level = DEBUG;\n                            $manual = true;\n                        }\n                        break;\n                    case 'UNIQUEID':\n                        $this-&gt;search = UNIQUEID;\n                        $this-&gt;value = $config['value'];\n                        if(( $this-&gt;uniqueid !== NULL) &amp;&amp; ( $this-&gt;uniqueid == $this-&gt;value)) {\n                            $this-&gt;level = DEBUG;\n                        }\n                        break;\n                    default:\n                        $this-&gt;search = _NONE;\n                }\n            }\n\n            if( $this-&gt;level &lt; $config['level']) {\n                $this-&gt;level = $config['level'];\n            }\n            $this-&gt;logDbConfig = $config;\n            $this-&gt;haveConfig = true;\n            $this-&gt;offline = false;\n        }\n    }\n\n\n\nJust.... why?

The new char[n] declares a char array with a length of n. Apparently you can give a String a char array as parameter. Replace replaces a String with another. \"\\0\" is the code for the null char which each element of an array was initialized with. Substring returns a specified part of a string based on the int input. 3&gt;=str.length returns a bool based on whether or not the length of a the string is less than or equal to 3. ?str.length():3 converts the bool to an int. If the length of the String str is less than three, the number becomes the length. Otherwise it becomes 3.",

        "text": "Good day everyone!\n\nI am here to tell you about a project that I started on once, but has since abandoned. Its name is *Unicorn OS*. An OS, written entirely in assembly. When I started this hobby back in 2010 I had never coded anything useful before. May have made the occasional decision of *finally learn how to program*, googled some tutorials, print some strings and then lose interest. I would mostly lose interest because I would never learn how computers *really* work, when just printing silly strings in C#. Thus I googled away and discovered how a processor works, and quickly stumbled upon the glorious language: **assembly**.\n\nOne thing led to another, and soon I would be designing a 16-bit OS. But I had made two major mistakes:\n\n* Learning assembly as my first language.\n* Writing an Operating System as my first project.\n\nThis would of course prove a challenge to my skills as a programmer. Designing and writing an OS is a HUGE task, and one should at least know how to comment code before starting out on such journey. Whatever. I was young and dumb, I guess.\n\nI hope the following tour of my personal horror-inducing offspring is somewhat understandable, since assembly-programmers are a rare thing these days.\n\n---\n---\n\nThe first thing I read through is the start of my kernel. The kernel is basically a large library of functions that can do stuff for whatever program is requesting it. It can get a string from the keyboard, or read files from the disk. The kernel has hundreds of functions, and each function has a unique identifying value. So at the start of the kernel, the code is looked up in a table to decide which address the system call resides, *right*? Wrong. This is how genius me decided to handle that task:\n\n    ;callcode trapline\n    mov ax, [bp+0x04];arg0\n    \n    cmp ax, 0x0000\n    je call0000\n    cmp ax, 0x0001\n    je call0001\n    cmp ax, 0x0002\n    je call0002\n    cmp ax, 0x0003\n    je call0003\n    cmp ax, 0x0004\n    je call0004\n\nThis goes on for hundreds and hundreds of lines.\nIn C, this would be the equivalent on the stupidity scale:\n\n    int kernel(int callcode) {\n      //callcode trapline\n      if (callcode == 0) {\n        goto cc0;\n      }\n      if (callcode == 1)\n        goto cc1;\n      }\n      if (callcode == 2) {\n      goto cc2;\n      }\n\nAnd so on. Ugh.\n\n(Before you slaughter me: *goto*'s are common in assembly.)\n\n---\n---\n\nLet's move on to something a bit more... horrible, shall we? Take a good look at this system call subroutine (btw, this is what we jump to if callcode == 0x0407...):\n    \n    call0407:;constrdec(cc, str), ax=num\n      xor dx, dx\n      mov bx, [bp+0x06];arg1\n      push bx\n      push 0x0405\n      call 0x1000\n      dec bx\n      cmp ax, 0x0005\n      jae .s5\n      cmp ax, 0x0004\n      je .s4\n      cmp ax, 0x0003\n      je .s3\n      cmp ax, 0x0002\n      je .s2\n      cmp ax, 0x0001\n      je .s1\n      cmp ax, 0x0000\n      je .ret\n      cmp ax, 0x0000\n      je .ret\n      .s5:\n      inc bx\n      mov al, [bx]\n      sub al, 0x30\n      jz .s4\n      .ls5:\n      add dx, 0x2710\n      dec al\n      jnz .ls5\n      .s4:\n      inc bx\n      mov al, [bx]\n      sub al, 0x30\n      jz .s3\n      .ls4:\n      add dx, 0x03e8\n      dec al\n      jnz .ls4\n      .s3:\n      inc bx\n      mov al, [bx]\n      sub al, 0x30\n      jz .s2\n      .ls3:\n      add dx, 0x0064\n      dec al\n      jnz .ls3\t\n      .s2:\n      inc bx\n      mov al, [bx]\n      sub al, 0x30\n      jz .s1\n      .ls2:\n      add dx, 0x000a\n      dec al\n      jnz .ls2\t\t\n      .s1:\n      inc bx\n      mov al, [bx]\n      sub al, 0x30\n      jz .ret\n      .ls1:\n      add dx, 0x0001\n      dec al\n      jnz .ls1\n      .ret:\n      mov [bp-0x02], dx;axret\n      jmp ret2\n\nThis has a total of **three comments** (btw: in assembly comments are done with the use of a semicolon). One comment naming the function for future reference, and another stating which argument we are accessing on the stack. The last comment is simply describing that we are returning some value from the function. Not at all useful, if one were to look at this code in the future.\n\nThere is a loop or two in there somewhere. But I would never have guessed at first, because almost the entire kernel is written with minimal use of the *tab*-button. Or space-bar. Sometimes a mix of both though. Moving on.\n\n\n\n---\n---\n\nMy last code example ended in one big mystery:\n\n    jmp ret2\n\nA jump to some magic happy-land that must return from the kernel. I have read other kernel functions as well, and they all end with a jump to some label of that naming convention: ret#.\n\nFor some reason I decided that the kernel is responsible for removing the arguments from the stack upon return. To do this in assembly you can issue a return instruction, followed by the number of bytes to pop off the stack. But let's see where the label *ret2* leads us:\n\n    ret2:\n    pop dx\n    pop cx\n    pop bx\n    pop ax\n    pop bp\n    ret 0x04\n\nSo, popping previous register states, and returns while removing four bytes off the stack, eh? This is, as in the first example, one of many. There is one system call that requires you to remove 17 arguments from the stack, and all flavors in between is in there too. This should seriously have been a macro...\n\nNote the *0x04*. I think I might have read some *tips to become a better programmer*, and come across some tip stating: *consistency is key!*\n\nFor me that meant writing ALL numbers in hexadecimal. Not only does it look cool, but it ensures maximum confusion when nice round numbers become a mess in hex. But yeah. Consistency. Right...\n\n---\n---\n\nI will end my guided tour by showing you some of my proudest work in this coding catastrophe: The printable banner of Unicorn OS. About the eye-catcher to the left in the banner: It was meant to look like the horn of a Unicorn. Some say it looks like a poo. Some say it looks like a fancy dildo. Some say it looks like a combination of both.\n\nI want to congratulate you, if you managed to read this without throwing up a little in your mouth.

        "text": "It took me a good week or 2 to dig through enough tests/data to extract this. I still have a headache.\n\n---\n\nSo at work part of our software uses a video recording library similar to VLC. The library has an exe, you pass it a string of arguments and it does its thing. \n\nNow, if I'm recording a stream and the stream falls over we can pick it back up again and record to a new file. At the end if there's multiple files we just merge them together. \n\nOkay, so the fun part \n\nWe were having an issue with our software where long recordings would exit with an error code 4. The error message was somewhere along the lines of \"too many fragments\". \n\nSome research later, what happens is that if the stream falls over and picks up again, then falls over &amp;lt;5s after that it counts as a fault. After 100 faults the recording gives up. Okay, so now I know *what* is happening, just have to figure out *why*. Time to dig deeper. \n\nI suspect that the code is being thrown during the finalization so I test that manually. The program exits with an \"invalid operation error\". Okay...? \n\nI try running the finalization steps manually and uncover that the real error is \"illegal or corrupt data at input\". Weird. \n\nSo I dig deeper and try running tests manually. By this point I'm so deep into our software that we're fully past the c#/.net levels and I'm at the marshaled cpp libraries. \n\nI eventually uncover that the source of the error is \"unsafe file paths\". The file paths we were using contained spaces but were inside double quotes. Apparently that wasn't enough for the library and it just refused to do anything and failed. I told it that unsafe file paths are ok and the 2 week problem goes away. \n\n---\n\nTldr-\n\nUser sees \"error code 4, too many fragments\" \n\nThis really means \"stream is too fragmented\" rather than having anything to do with video fragments \n\n... Which is being thrown upon receiving an \"illegal operation error\" \n\n... That is being caused by \"illegal or corrupt data at input\" \n\n.....

        "text": "So a client of mine wanted to associate businesses with a sales rep.  I've never encountered this project before but it's an easy task. So why not help them out?\n\nI fired up the solution, it's a simple web forms project laid out in a typical three tier fashion. I added a simple migration for a new table and a FK on the joining table. No problem, now for the form. \n\nFirst I noticed the code layout was all a bit weird. No problem here, style isn't everything. Then I spotted a few little gems that peaked my interest. \n\n    bool shouldResetControl = false;\n        if (shouldResetControl) { }; \n\nYeah hmm. That seems quite redundant. \n\n    if (val == null || val.IsNull) {\n        return false;\n    }\n    return true;\n\nSo does this. These problems occurred far too frequently to be a mistake but I shuddered it off as a novice mistake and moved on. \n\n    /// &lt;summary&gt;\n    /// This is a convenience property that provides direct access to the table's columns object.\n    /// &lt;/summary\n\nYeah okay, it's not _that convenient_ but I get it. These were in singleton classes with static methods returning the same value as the instance properties. \n\n    #region \"Shared helper methods\"\n    ...\n\nThese methods aren't helpful at all! This isn't adding up. For every table column there exists 6-8 overloaded methods. I just chalked it up as someone not knowing generics.\n\nThen I stumbled upon this gem, behold:\n\n\tpublic static string GetXMLString()\n\t{\n\t\tif(_DefinitionString == \"\")\n\t\t{\n\t\t\tSystem.Text.StringBuilder tbf = new System.Text.StringBuilder();\n\t\t\ttbf.Append(@\"&lt;XMLDefinition Generator=\"\"Iron Speed Designer\"\" Version=\"\"8.0\"\" Type=\"\"GENERIC\"\"&gt;\");\n\t\t\t_DefinitionString = tbf.ToString();\n \t\t\ttbf.Append(  @\"&lt;ColumnDefinition&gt;\");\n\t\t\t_DefinitionString = tbf.ToString();\n\t\t\ttbf.Append(    @\"&lt;Column InternalName=\"\"0\"\" Priority=\"\"1\"\" ColumnNum=\"\"0\"\"&gt;\");\n\t\t\t_DefinitionString = tbf.ToString();\n\t\t\ttbf.Append(      @\"&lt;columnName&gt;StateId&lt;/columnName&gt;\");\n\t\t\t_DefinitionString = tbf.ToString();\n\t\t\ttbf.Append(      @\"&lt;columnUIName&gt;State&lt;/columnUIName&gt;\");\n\t\t\t_DefinitionString = tbf.ToString();\n \t\t\ttbf.Append(      @\"&lt;columnType&gt;Number&lt;/columnType&gt;\");\n\t\t\t_DefinitionString = tbf.ToString();\n\t\t\ttbf.Append(      @\"&lt;columnDBType&gt;int&lt;/columnDBType&gt;\");\n\t\t\t_DefinitionString = tbf.ToString();\n\t\t\ttbf.Append(      @\"&lt;columnLengthSet&gt;10.0&lt;/columnLengthSet&gt;\");\n\t\t\t_DefinitionString = tbf.ToString();\n\t\t\ttbf.Append(      @\"&lt;columnDefault&gt;&lt;/columnDefault&gt;\");\n\t\t\t_DefinitionString = tbf.ToString();\n\t\t\ttbf.Append(      @\"&lt;columnDBDefault&gt;&lt;/columnDBDefault&gt;\");\n\t\t\t_DefinitionString = tbf.ToString();\n\t\t\ttbf.Append(      @\"&lt;columnIndex&gt;Y&lt;/columnIndex&gt;\");\n\t\t\t_DefinitionString = tbf.ToString();\n\t\t\ttbf.Append(      @\"&lt;columnUnique&gt;Y&lt;/columnUnique&gt;\");\n\t\t\t...\n\t\t\t...\n\nAnd that's when it hit me,   `\"\"Iron Speed Designer\"\"` \n\nIt's Generated! Great. That explains half of it. But why is this generated code so appalling?\n\nWhat would possibly convince someone to create a StringBuilder to append a single line of XML then ToString that _after each line_?! If it's generated XML why not just save it as an XML file? Let's Google these guys and find out.\n\nUpon typing it into my browser I noticed that \"crack\" pop up on the Google autosuggestions list. Sounds promising. I opened up the page and what's on the top left but this:\n\n&gt; Write 10,000 Lines of Code in 10 Minutes!\n\nRight... So now since we've got your target market locked in why not check out what people have to say.\n\n&gt; Technical support for Iron Speed Designer was discontinued on December 31, 2015 as part of our company ceasing operations.\n\nNow I've got nothing against auto generating CRUD tools, I use them, but I'm going to have a guess what happened here. \n\nOne day some developers set out and made a cool little CRUD creating app to help out development. To make it flash you could skin it. It worked out well but they wanted to capitalize. Marketing came along and sold everyone that this tool will write your business apps for you! A bunch of cheapskates bought the idea (or were so cheap they pirated it) and when it didn't do everything, they complained, \"it only generated 5000 Lines! I want my 10,000!\". \n\nThe developers set out to generate as many lines of code that still seemed reasonable as they could. Developers using the product realised this crummy mess and moved onto better tools meanwhile the cheapskates continued to pirate or complain. More lines of code = more money. This cycle went on for years. Developers continued to write worse and worse code struggling for a way out, a scapegoat, a way to savage whatever little reputation they had left. Until finally, it hit. \n\n[Business closed](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/09/07/sunk_by_patent_troll_iron_speed_stops_ops/) \n\nIt could happen to any of us. \n",

        "text": "One project I've been working on has gone through many different programmers, each with their own idea of how indenting is going to work. It eventually ended up with me and one other guy to try and sort it all out. Let me break down the cornucopia of different indent styles that are used on this codebase:\n\n- 3 spaces for all the original code\n- 2 spaces by one of the past programmers\n- Tabs, by me when attempting to clean it up\n- 3 spaces again, by the other current programmer\n\nOver all, the indenting in some places has become a disaster. I've tried to convert everything I touch into tabs, but my partner's IDE is aggressively set on 3 spaces and he's not motivated enough to change that. No code formatting tools will work on this either, because it's not a well-known language.\n\nSo here's what the indenting looks like in some places:\n\n    --&gt; Denotes a tab\n    .   Denotes a space\n\n     function getGemAtPosition(%position, %datablock, %grp) {\n    ...%set = findObjectsAtPosition(%position, %grp);\n    --&gt;%set.schedule(0, \"delete\"); //Memory mgmt\n    \n    --&gt;//We might have more than one gem\n    ..&gt;for (%i = 0; %i &lt; %set.getSize(); %i ++) {\n    ..&gt;--&gt;%obj = %set.getEntry(%i);\n    ..&gt;--&gt;//If it's correct\n    ......if (%obj.getClassName() $= \"Item\" &amp;&amp; %obj.getDataBlock().className $= \"Gem\" &amp;&amp; %obj.position $= %position &amp;&amp; %obj.getDataBlock().getName() $= %datablock)\n    --&gt;......return %obj;\n    ...}\n    ...return -1;\n    }\n\nOr my other favorite section:\n\n    .-&gt;--&gt;..&gt;--&gt;--&gt;// It's not a space, prepend the HEX value with a %\n    .-&gt;--&gt;..&gt;--&gt;--&gt;%chrTemp = \"%\" @ %chrTemp;\n\nAs you can see, I've given up on some files at this point.\n\n**Edit: After reading all of your nice replies I decided to format the code correctly. Digging through my script history I found** `astyle --indent=tab --style=attach --indent-cases --pad-header --unpad-paren --lineend=linux`. **Apart from a few cases where I had to fix it manually, everything is pretty much clean now.**",

So whenever we would navigate, it would check for an attribute that wasn't there for 48 different sub menus. \n\nAfter some additional investigating, it appeared that the bool wasn't even needed anymore.\n\nThe application is filled with this kind of stuff and more. It's like at some point, the devs started to just add anything to make it work whenever they had to without concerns as for the direction of the application. ",

The entire codebase is littered with this sort of thing, and what almost amazes me more is the lack of a Java formatter, which is always more successful than a JS formatter. This guy was a piece of work.\n\nThe framework being used here is called dojo - its been on its way out for years, but that's another infuriating part of inheriting code lol\n\nEdit: to everyone suggesting I use a formatter - this is the result of a JS formatter. Writing Dojo is essentially writing a big complex JS object and at a certain point of complexity you can't define simple rules, and all formatters I have tried just give up and do something like this. I have had minor success but the majority of the time I just have to manually reformat most things.

Two hours of desk checking later (of course this is happening on the on open action and everything locks straight away like its gone in to the form so I can't step through it) it finally clicks. The only difference between our boxes is that I'm running a dual monitor setup.\n\nI run back down, move the access interface to my primary monitor, save and buzz ones of the managers.
