It has everything an anti-America rant possibly could. Imperialism, big corporate, evil founding fathers, Israel, unmanned drones, and a 9/11 black flag conspiracy. Sadly not all of it is history, but some of it is. In fact it's not just bad history, it's some of the worst bad history I have ever seen. It's just made up. Hopefully I can debunk it.\n\n&gt; There has been almost no coup or government overthrow since 1945 not led by the US.\n\nWhat? Every single coup or government overthrow since 1945 was led by the US? Clearly that means I shouldn't be able to find many examples to counter this claim. Examples like the [conquest of South Vietnam](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War#Fall_of_Saigon), [the Cuban Revolution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban_Revolution), [the Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnamese_invasion_of_Cambodia), [the Hungarian Revolt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_Revolution_of_1956), [the breakup of Yugoslavia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_Yugoslavia), [the creation of a communist state in Afghanistan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Republic_of_Afghanistan#The_Saur_Revolution_and_Taraki:_1978.E2.80.931979), and the [Arab Spring Revolt.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Spring) Hey that wasn't hard.\n\n&gt; the ultimate concern of the US Constitution is the protection of private property and wealth at the top against the masses and democratic reversal. \n\nThe evil and greedy founding fathers created a constitution that only deals with establishing control of the ignorant sheeple. That is such an ignorant generalization. What about [everything else in the constitution.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_United_States#Original_frame) You know things about government, checks and balances, quartering troops, taxation. You know things that kind of lead to [the creation of the United States.](http://americanhistory.about.com/od/revolutionarywar/a/amer_revolution.htm) Why put these grievances in the constitution if it exists solely to please the rich? Surely this should have lead to great prosperity for the founding fathers right? Well [Thomas Jefferson retired and mostly focused on his library.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson#Final_days) James Monroe [sold his plantation.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Monroe#Post-presidency) George Washington retired to his plantation, [which might not have been that profitable.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington#Retirement_.281797.E2.80.931799.29) It doesn't sound like they benefited from their elitist document meant to appease the rich directly. Maybe it's because they accidentally wasted so much space talking about liberty and rights.\n\nAnyways I hope I did a sufficient job of debunking the obvious bad history in this thing. Virtually all of it is questionable, but some of this bad history just stood out. Especially considering that this was from a man with a PhD in philosophy. Surely that gives his historical opinions merit.",

        "text": "You may or may not know that the channel once known as The Military Channel is rebranding as the [American Heroes Channel](http://www.ahctv.com/). If you're a long time subscriber to BadHistory, you may also be aware that my main contribution has been continual reviews of popular media dealing with history; especially those that deal with the late eighteenth century in America. Whether it be documentaries, video games, porn, comics, movies, or TV shows, I've always taken pains to point out the fallacies so that others might avoid them.\n\nI come to you, hat in hand, fully willing to admit my own failure on that front.\n\nThe American Heroes Channel's effort to rebrand has a really daunting goal: no material produced prior to 2015 will be shown in 2015. That's a really remarkable objective, and one that I'm not yet sure they can pull off. Think about it: when was the last time any network discarded decades of work to do entirely new series that are supposed to last through 365 days of 24 hour programming? It's a risky move, and I'm eager to see how it pays off.\n\nThe reason this is relevant is AHC is currently doing a blitz on production to reach that goal. About a month ago they visited my museum to film an episode of the upcoming *Secrets of the Armory* series. I am not entirely sure which armory they are referring to, or the premise of the documentary series. It wasn't my job to know. I was cast the main character of an episode about the [Culper Ring](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culper_Ring): Robert Townsend.\n\nLet me first put out a disclaimer: the crew was amazing. They were working on the definition of a shoestring budget and had only one day to film fifteen minutes of footage. By comparison, I worked a History Channel documentary where they spent twelve hours filming a fifteen second shot they cut from the final version. I've spent a whole day just standing around in blurry shots so that *Rizzoli &amp; Isles* could have the vague outline of reenactors for half a second. The crew for *Secrets of the Armory* had incredibly limited resources and they knew how to use them. I've often worked shows and documentaries where the crews couldn't give two shits about history, but here the director would approach our site director and even me to ask about they tiny details that they *could* control. Even so, there was a lot they couldn't help. Most extras were volunteer. Even speaking roles had to be played by crew members hastily thrown into costume.\n\nThey did a great job considering what they had, but I fucked it up.\n\nThere wasn't a script per se, so I was given a premise and trusted to make up dialogue that would work. This is way more trust in historians than any documentary I've ever worked. \n\nThe scene: British soldiers came into the storefront (really just the re-purposed cellar of our manor house) and I had to distract them with the wares for sale to prevent them from discovering the compromising papers I had just been reading in the back room. When one of the lobsterbacks picked up a clay pipe, I motioned enthusiastically to it and ensured him that they cost \"A mere shilling.\"\n\nIvor Noel Hume, in his ever reliable *A Guide to Artifacts of Colonial America*, describes clay pipes of the colonial period as being \"as expendable as cigarettes\" and \"extremely cheap.\" They were sold \"in 1709 for as little as two shillings a gross.\" If Townsend had charged a shilling a piece, he would ensure that those pipes would never be sold. Who the hell would pay such an exorbitant rate for pipes? After realizing my error, I adjusted it for the next few takes, claiming they were sold for a mere farthing a piece.\n\nA farthing equaled half a half penny, and there were twelve pence to a shilling. At 48 farthings to a shilling, and 72 pipes to a shilling, it is somewhat more likely that you would be selling individual pipes by the farthing, but I based that line on nothing. I hadn't done the research, and I hadn't checked to see if I were correct in the assumption.\n\nBy way of apology, [here's](https://fbcdn-sphotos-h-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xfp1/t1.0-9/10401653_738585526184561_6181006374751765956_n.jpg) some [behind](https://scontent-a-lga.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xaf1/v/t1.0-9/10513505_738636836179430_1759715651631685074_n.jpg?oh=fa33681be374f74cb206cf0fa4c7cb35&amp;oe=5462DA48) the [scenes](https://fbcdn-sphotos-b-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xfp1/t1.0-9/10389557_738585522851228_6882935024050538023_n.jpg) photos of the show *Secrets of the Armory*, slated to come out next year on AHC.",

        "text": "Welcome to another bright and sunny day on badhistory. Today we will explore a subreddit that hasn't seen nearly its share of bad history since becoming a default: [/r/history](http://np.reddit.com/r/history/). Unfortunately, even excellent moderation can't stop all the badhistory this sub can produce. Today's example comes courtesy of [/u/sharplet](http://np.reddit.com/user/sharplet) and concerns the repeatability of history and what trends can be discerned in modern times.\n\n\nThe bad history herein is rampant and covers such a broad range of topics that no one person could properly debunk it all. Let's do something a little different instead. Take one prediction from the thread and debunk it in the comments. We can analyze this together. \n\nWithout further ado: [On the cyclical dynamics of historical bodies](http://np.reddit.com/r/history/comments/2cyzb3/we_always_say_that_history_repeats_itself_do_you/)\n\n&gt; Both Napoleon and Hitler lost wars by invading Russia too late in the summer to achieve victory before winter set in.\n\nWhile this comment does on to imply the importance of the enormous logistical challenges any invading army in russia faces, it fails to note the full scope of the problems. First and foremost, any major operation to invade russia can scarcely begin earlier in the year than June. May is the end of winter in Russia and by its end, roads are still impassably muddy for large scale operations. Not only that, the issues of the Napoleonic and German campaigns in Russia encountered vastly different issues, of which winter was only one.\n\nIn the French campaign, one of the biggest issues was that Napoleon fed his army by foraging and seizure of local resources. While this policy was excellent in the bounty of continental Europe, it faltered in Russia. Napoleon's troops and horses were consistently underfed throughout the campaign. This led not only to a lack of ability, but also a lack of morale. Troop losses from disease and desertion took an enormous toll on the campaign.\n\nIn contrast, the Germans survived not one winter, but three. The success of their intial invasion had too many components to list here. Prematurity of the Soviet military, inadequate defenses along the border, officer inexperience, and tactical errors. Eventually the Germans were pushed out of Russia as well, but for reasons that have little resemblance to the Napoleonic campaign. By the end, Germany was short on troops and quickly running out of supplies. They faced an experienced and competent Soviet military, experience hardened in the fires of the brutal war. \n\n&gt; If you refuse to raise taxes during wartime to keep your populace happy, your economy will soon be screwed. Germany during WWI and the US under W.\n\n\nThe German economy was wrecked for reasons far beyond simply refusing to raise taxes. The US economic crashes during the war were further almost entirely unrelated to the war. It's generally held that the downturn in the housing market led to a financial crisis as securities exploded.\n\n&gt; Burning of the Reichstag building by terrorists in Nazi Germany enabled a power grip by the fascists, putting the whole country in emergency state and then enabling tighter regulation and easier achieving of self-interested goals.\nAnd then there was 9/11...\n\nThis is so ridiculously idiotic that it shouldn't even need debunking. 9/11 was not a false flag operation. Next.\n\n&gt; Modern day holocausts happen everyday around the world. We just don't hear of them too much.\n\n[citation needed]\n\nIt's widely accepted that conflicts are ongoing in parts of Eurasia and Africa. Sudan and Burma are two examples of what some consider modern genocidal conflicts. But a genocide is **not** a holocaust. There are no conflicts in the world in which a large state rounds up undesirable members of society and tortures them in death camps on an industrial scale. Those situations where the conflict may superficially resemble Nazi Germany (like North Korea) have all been widely reported by every major media outlet and can hardly be called \"unheard of\".\n\n\n&gt; Israel doing what the Nazi's did to them to Palestinians.\n\nAs I implied above, Israel is not capturing Palestinians and forcing them to work in death camps until they die. They're not doing the sadistic experiments the Nazis did, nor are they gassing undesirables. They're not looting the gold off dead bodies and they're most certainly not invading foreign countries to round up the people they don't like.  \n\n&gt; Slavery and working minimum wage struggling to make a living\nI feel like it's the Middle Ages where people just work and die then the wealthy live the better lives\n\n\nMinimum wage is incomparable to slavery. Your boss can't decide who you can marry or what you do on vacation. Your boss doesn't own your children. Your boss isn't literally whipping you for not doing a good job. In fact, it's rather insulting to historical slaves or even those people involved in the modern institution of slavery to consider them even remotely comparable to minimum wage.\n\nThere's a choice selection. I look forward to seeing your own in the comments.",

It was a very successful con job...\n\nThese points contradict many accounts from all over Asia, for instance on the [Asian Women's Fund site](http://www.awf.or.jp/e3/oralhistory-00.html), this account by a Japanese-Korean woman:\n\n&gt;When she was 16 years old, she went to Seoul for better employment on the recommendation of her friend who worked as housemaid for a Japanese family. Led by a Japanese, she was put on a train to go from Seoul to Tianjin, China, then from Tianjin via Peitan to Zaoqiang. There she was forced to be a comfort woman for the Japanese military.\n\nOn the issue of direct military involvement:\n\n&gt;At 4 o'clock in the morning we took ride on a train. It stopped for two hours at Shanhaiguan at which point myself and Yoshiko attempted to escape. But the exits were blocked by military police. We were much too scared to escape from the train. We spent one night in the train and on the second day arrived at Tianjin at 11 o'clock. When we got off the train at Tianjin, fully armed soldiers were waiting for us with a truck, a coach and a jeep.\n\nThe Yoshida Seiji story has gained some currency among Japanese right-wingers who see its retraction as a confirmation that all of the above didn't happen, and that the Kono statement had no basis in fact, but the review of the statement [did not call the basic facts into question](http://www.japantimes.co.jp/opinion/2014/06/25/editorials/stop-undermining-kono-statement/#.U-RWvWR4bDM):\n\n&gt;The 1993 statement says the frontline brothels, called “comfort stations,” were established at the request of Japanese military authorities, who also were involved directly or indirectly in their management and transfer of the women to such establishments. “The recruitment of the comfort women was conducted mainly by private recruiters who acted in response to the request of the military” and “in many cases they were recruited against their own will, through coaxing, coercion, etc., and that, at times, administrative/military personnel directly took part in the recruitments,” the statement says.",

        "text": "EDITED TO INCLUDE MORE STUFF\n\nThe city of Glasgow is going to become the second city in the UK to [fly a Palestinian flag](http://www.glasgow.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=12808) in a show of solidarity with people in Gaza. In Glasgow's case, the decision was influenced by the fact that Glasgow's sister city is Bethlehem, which has suffered heavily in the attacks. The decision has, of course, caused [controversy](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-28682483) among lots of different groups for lots of different reasons. In the case of the argument (one of many) on /r/Glasgow, it's become a debate over [who is more justified and just what the history and legitimacy of the state of Israel is](http://np.reddit.com/r/glasgow/comments/2ct044/glasgow_city_council_to_fly_palestine_flag/cjiz2xz). \n\nI'll preface this post by saying that I am not an expert on the Israel-Palestine conflict, but I do have quite a lot of knowledge about it. One of my bachelor's degrees is in religious studies with a focus on the Middle East, Islam, and religious conflict, but that doesn't begin to prepare me for dealing with the clusterfuck that is history, revisionism, and debate surrounding the Israel-Palestine conflict. It does give me a bit of a pro-Palestine bias, which I'll freely admit, but a bias does not knowledge make.\n\nBut hey, I'm not one to be daunted by the fact that I'm probably not as much of an expert as I'd like to be. I think it's probably impossible to be as much of an expert as I'd like to be, so I'll just take what I have and see what I can do. I'm also going to try my very, very hardest to not break rule 2, which means no inclusion, discussion, or mention of the current conflict, or indeed anything past the First Intifada. That means I'm not going to engage with any of the more charged language in the linked thread. Probably for the best anyway.\n\nThe first thing to establish is that every post in this thread has something wrong. As I said, I won't engage with the politics, but the history - confused, jumbled, and biased though it may be - is fair game. For instance, this: \n\n&gt; Its a fact that Palestine attacked Israel the day after it was established in 1948. Israel defended itself. Palestine continued to attack, Israel continued to defend itself. Israel offered a ceasefire and a two state option, Palestine declined and attacked brining us to recent times...\n\nisn't an entirely accurate picture of the founding of Israel and the conflicts there.\n\nTo understand why, we'll go back a ways to before the founding of Israel. During WWI, there was a series of documents called the [McMahon-Hussein Correspondence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McMahon%E2%80%93Hussein_Correspondence). This was a series of letters sent from the British High Commissioner in Egypt to the Sharif of Mecca, encouraging Arabs to revolt against the Ottoman Empire, promising support in said revolt, and - most importantly, for our purposes - promising recognition of an independent Arab state afterwards. The exact promise of recognition was: \n\n&gt; The districts of Mersina and Alexandretta, and portions of Syria lying to the west of the districts of Damascus, Homs, Hama and Aleppo, cannot be said to be purely Arab, and must on that account be excepted from the proposed limits and boundaries. With the above modification and without prejudice to our existing treaties concluded with Arab Chiefs, we accept these limits and boundaries, and in regard to the territories therein in which Great Britain is free to act without detriment to interests of her ally France, I am empowered in the name of the Government of Great Britain to give the following assurance and make the following reply to your letter: Subject to the above modifications, Great Britain is prepared to recognize and support the independence of the Arabs within the territories in the limits and boundaries proposed by the Sherif of Mecca.\n\n(For reference [here's a map](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McMahon%E2%80%93Hussein_Correspondence#mediaviewer/File:McMahon_letter_%27districts%27.png).) One trouble with the correspondences was that they were originally written in Arabic, where the word \"district\" translates as the Ottoman word \"vilayet.\" What a \"vilayet\" implied was not entirely clear, leading to conflicts of interpretation. The official British position was that this entailed only certain areas of Syria. However, in December 1918, the Eastern Committee of the Cabinet met to discuss the exact question of what was supposed to happen to Palestine. They came to a number of conclusions, including:\n\n&gt; The Palestine position is this. If we deal with our commitments, there is first the general pledge to Hussein in October 1915, under which Palestine was included in the areas as to which Great Britain pledged itself that they should be Arab and independent in the future.\n\nUnder this interpretation, Palestine was an Arab state. What followed was some very optimistic flyering of Palestine, saying it would be independent via an agreement reached by Sharif Hussein and the British. However, by 1920, the independent Syrian government had been overthrown by the French, and the British took over Palestine. Independence, it turns out, had been a pipe dream. There would continue to be arguing about the wording and the intention of the McMahon-Hussein Correspondence, and it would continue to be relevant when discussing the founding of Israel. \n\nHowever, in 1917, another important document enters the picture. [The Balfour Declaration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration_of_1917) was given by the UK Foreign Secretary to Baron Rothschild to be given to the Zionist Federation of Great Britain and Ireland. It stated: \n\n&gt; His Majesty's government view with favour the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people, and will use their best endeavours to facilitate the achievement of this object, it being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine, or the rights and political status enjoyed by Jews in any other country.\n\nYou can imagine that this poses difficulties. However, in 1920, the [San Remo Conference](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Remo_conference) established a series of mandates in the disputed territory. This established European rule over Syria and Lebanon, Mesopotamia, and Palestine, contrary to what had been promised in the McMahon-Hussein Correspondence. This, however, would make it easier to implement the Balfour Declaration, seeing as the territory now lay under British control. In 1922, the British made it explicitly clear that they hadn't intended to grant Palestine independence, while Sharif Hussein stated that he had intended to include Palestine. Sharif Hussein also made it abundantly clear that he did not support the creation of an independent Jewish state in the region. Arab protest not only in the Middle East, but in the UK as well was immediate. In the wake of the fall of Syria as well, Arab nationalism reached a fever pitch, especially in response to European colonialism (and perceived European colonialism). There were bloody conflicts between Arabs and Jews who had come into the region, and escalating violence. Some of these conflicts preceded the Mandate (such as the [Nebi Musa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1920_Nebi_Musa_riots) riots of 1920), while others - such as the [Jaffa riots](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaffa_riots) and the [1929 Hebron Massacre](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1929_Hebron_massacre) - took place later. In each of these conflicts, both sides grew more and more frustrated with the British. In the Nebi Musa riots, for instance, there were accusations of British complicity in the riots, especially given that some of the rioters had been pardoned for their crimes, a freeze on Jewish immigration followed, and Jews had a general perception that they had been abandoned by the British. However, over the course of the [1936-1939 Arab Revolt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1936%E2%80%931939_Arab_revolt_in_Palestine), the British armed and trained young Jewish men to help fight Palestinian rebels. This increased support for the British, albeit temporarily as the Palestine White Paper of 1939 - which restricted Jewish immigration to Palestine - was heavily reacted against. It also had the effect of disarming large swaths of the Palestinian population, which had a fairly large effect on the war in 1948.\n\nAll of this leads into this particular debate:\n\n&gt; Israel was established illegally, how can you possibly say Palestine attacked first when they came with the permission of a country who had no place to have a word, illegally occupied their land and killed thousands in the process?\n\n&gt; Israel wasn't established illegally...\nThe Jews were given that land by the British as no other country on earth would accept them. Is it not fair that Jews have a homeland to themselves?\n\n&gt; Mate if you're labelling Israel occupation of Palestine as legal then I can no go back and forth with you regarding this matter. Not only was their occupation illegal but they have persistently breached international law.\n\nThe legality of the state of Israel is something that's long been debated and brought up as a reason for Palestine getting the territory. However, it must be said that regardless of whether or not it was legal at the time, Israel is a state, as legitimate as the US or France or any other. It has recognition, and meets the UN's criteria for a full member state. Legally, I can't think of many standards that are better. \n\nIt's still well-worth looking at the history of the founding of Israel. As I said, the legal aspects have been debated, but the history is clear enough. Prior to 1947, Jewish immigrants had been pouring into Palestine from across Europe. It's thought that over the course of immigration during and after WWII, [over 100 000 Jews tried to enter Palestine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliyah_Bet) with likely half being stopped and detained by the British. By the end of 1946, of the 1 846 000 people in the Mandate, roughly a third were Jewish, and the other two-thirds Arab. However, [85%](http://www.foreignpolicyjournal.com/2010/10/26/the-myth-of-the-u-n-creation-of-israel/view-all/) of the land was estimated to be owned by Arabs (partly due to limits on land ownership instituted under the White Paper of 1939). This land and population discrepancy was not necessarily taken into consideration with Resolution 181 (II), which divided the land with Arabs receiving 45.5% of the land, and Jews receiving 55.5% ([map!](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Partition_Plan_for_Palestine#mediaviewer/File:UN_Palestine_Partition_Versions_1947.jpg)). In any case, Britain proposed that the UN decide on the division of Palestine, which resulted in Resolution 181 (II), passed on 29 November 1947. Israel itself would gain independence on 14 May 1948 with the expiration of the British Mandate, and with the [Israeli Declaration of Independence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaration_of_the_Establishment_of_the_State_of_Israel). However, immediately after Resolution 181 (II), Arab nationalism and the perception of being wronged resulted in the 1947 Civil War, which eventually turned into the 1948 Arab-Israeli War as well as al-Nakba. The end of these wars saw the seizure of Palestine and the idea of a UN partition falling through. \n\nI am not a lawyer, but I do have some background in international law. The creation of Israel was left to the UN by the country that had control of the area (Great Britain). One of the major arguments that has been levied about the illegality of the creation of Israel is that it disregarded the right of the Arab majority to self-determination. The UN Special Committee on Palestine even acknowledged this problem, stating: \n\n&gt; With regard to the principle of self-determination, although international recognition was extended to this principle at the end of the First World War and it was adhered to with regard to the other Arab territories, at the time of the creation of the \"A\" Mandates, it was not applied to Palestine, obviously because of the intention to make possible the creation of the Jewish National Home there. Actually, it may well be said that the Jewish National Home and the sui generis Mandate for Palestine run counter to that principle. [Source](http://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/07175DE9FA2DE563852568D3006E10F3)\n\nThe Ad Hoc Committee on the Palestine Question then later concluded that the UN had no right to create a state in which power was given to the minority without the consent of the majority, and that such a state violated the UN Charter ([source](http://unispal.un.org/pdfs/AAC1432.pdf)) This debate has often been used to argue that Israel is an illegal state. However, it has also been argued that since a UN resolution was passed that that was sufficient recognition of the state of Israel. However, what must be considered with regards to international law is that there are two different sorts of international law. There is hard law (treaties and such) and customary law (most other things). Customary law isn't binding, per se, but can be considered more a system of norms and guidelines that are binding when someone wants them to be. Even if hard law is found to be lacking, Israel's victory in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War essentially established that Israel was going to be a state, even if the legal question wasn't entirely clear. There was a set of documents that could be used to make a decision in a court about its legality or illegality one way or the other - for all practical purposes, and with regards to customary law, that victory fully established Israel as a state. Even more than that, though, the legality of the creation of the state of Israel has very little bearing on the debate *now.*\n\nThat's a crash course in the origins of the conflict, but there's one more aspect I'd like to cover, and it's arguably one of the most controversial aspects. \n\nThe history of Israel after 1948 is one of war and the gradual takeover of more and more of Palestinian land. However, it would be inaccurate to say that this is because Israel was just snatchy-grabby. For instance, the Six Day Way in 1967 could be - and has been, often - argued to have been a defensive war, in which Israel was responding to an imminent threat by the Arab states around it. Considering Egypt had been massing troops on the Israeli border, this perspective seems not entirely unjustified (though whether or not Israel's pre-emptive strike on Egyptian troops was justified is not an argument that I'm going to get into here, though I'm happy to argue it in the comments). Israeli fears about their Arab neighbours became even more justified after the 1973 Yom Kippur War, in which an Arab coalition consisting of Egypt and Syria launched a surprise attack during the holiest time in the Jewish calendar. This war, especially, was brutal, with Israel suffering early losses, though eventually winning. Egypt and Syria, also, tortured prisoners in violation of the Geneva Conventions. More than anything, the Yom Kippur War instilled in Israelis a fear that they would not always be able to beat their Arab neighbours in war. Indeed, Israel was rocked by protests after the war ended, leading to Golda Meir's resignation in 1974. However, the Yom Kippur War also led to a recognition on both the Israeli and Arab side that war and militarism were likely not going to solve their problems. That said, when Egypt did sign a peace treaty with Israel as a result of the Camp David Accords, the Arab world was outraged, seeing it as a surrender of the idea of Arab sovereignty of Palestine. It was also seen as being in violation of the [Khartoum Resolution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khartoum_Resolution) of 1967 which had stated that there would be \"no peace with Israel, no recognition of Israel, no negotiations with it.\"\n\nAll of this, coupled with Israeli actions of deportations and arrests of Palestinians, created a sense of oppression and frustration on the part of the Palestinians. Also tied in with this is the idea of being tied to land. For the Palestinian diaspora, the idea of حق العودة, or Right of Return is huge. Land rights are one of the major issues about which Palestinians are largely unwilling to compromise. There is a tradition as well among those that fled in 1948 of passing the key to the house down from generation to generation so that someday, someone can return. With the increased deportations and removals in the mid-80s and continuing into the 90s, this idea of an attachment to a particular bit of land became extremely important. (continued in comments)",

        "text": "*Note: I am not implying Rasputin WAS actually the lover of the Russian queen. That is silliness*\n\n\n\nRecently I've seen all these awesome high-effort R5 posts springing up, and I've just been thinking 'Man, I should do one of those.' But on what? I'm barely even an amateur historian, probably not even that. Enthusiast is the proper word. If only some juicy badhistory could pop up on something that I actually know a lot about! Like- like something on Russian history. More specifically, on Peter the Great! I just got through reading [*Peter the Great: His Life and World*](http://www.amazon.ca/Peter-Great-His-Life-World/dp/0345298063) by Robert K. Massie, a well-regarded historian on ol' Petey. And what's this? I wake up and see some bad history on Peter the Great! Well, I says to myself 'Breaksfull, it is mother-fucking ON.'\n\n\n\nSo on the front page of /r/todayilearned we have a [post](http://np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/2cs2d8/til_when_peter_the_great_found_his_wife_had_a/) concerning my favorite totalitarian monarch and Tsar, Peter 'Motherfuckin' The Great. Coming from [this source here](http://www.tristarmedia.com/bestofrussia/peter.html) we learn that Peter's wife had an affair with William Mons. Now this claim in and of itself wouldn't be too surprising, Catherine and Peter had a fairly open relationship and neither particularly begrudged the other for affairs, as evident by teasing letters between the two. So when this article claims that when Peter learned of this affair he flew into a rage and had Mons beheaded, had the head preserved in alcohol, and forced to remain in Catherine's room as punishment, I began to grow a bit suspicious.\n\n\n\nLooking further into this matter, I found out that this theory seems to originate from a fellow named Karl Shaw, author of [*Royal Babylon: The Alarming History of European Royalty*,](http://www.amazon.ca/Royal-Babylon-Alarming-History-European/dp/0767907558) a book about the various eccentricities of European monarchs throughout the ages. Shaw -not a historian- seems to be trying to stretch the truth here, and the book seems to be a bit one-sided in showing off just how crazy those monarchs were. It's tabloid-ized history, dumbing things down for the less-knowledgeable for entertainments sake, basically what Cracked does whenever they talk about history. Sometimes it's all fun and good, sometimes a little too fun and good at the expense of the facts. \n\n\n\nNow, ol' Petey was an interesting chestnut. He loved to party and play practical jokes, and genuinely wanted to push Russia forward to catch up with the world. He believed in meritocracy and was known to visit drydocks and work alongside the workers constructing his beloved navy. However he was also very short tempered and prone to explosive, angry behavior. Catherine I was his second wife and his real true love, he married her after his much chillier and more political marriage to Eudoxia Lopukhina which fell apart in ten years, resulting in her forcibly becoming a nun. Catherine was a good match for him, from all accounts they got along quite well together and she was the only one who could calm his rages and epileptic seizures, holding his head as she sat and stroking his hair until he fell asleep. Kawaii as fuck. \n\n\n\nNow we also know that Peter didn't really care for adultery. This (among many, MANY other things) pissed off the more Orthodox Russians but throughout his reign Peter was [fairly flippant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_All-Joking,_All-Drunken_Synod_of_Fools_and_Jesters) towards the Church and orthodoxy. When he learned that Charles V banned adultery on pain of death, he remarked *\"I should have thought that so great a prince had more judgement.\"* On another occasion he forbid a pregnant women from being banned from the company of other maidens on account of her bastard child, and put her under his personal protection. And as evident from Peter and Catherine's good-natured teasing letters it was known that he a few flings here and there. \n\n\nNow, let's talk about William Mons. Mons was a Russian-born German who had it made. He was handsome, well-connected, shrewd, and ambitious. And in time had had gained a position of favor with Catherine, being one of her confidants alongside his sister Matrena. Over time, the pair began to get control over access to the Tsars wife. It was well known that Catherine had great deal of influence over Peter, and the siblings began to present petitions and appeals in a favorable way towards Catherine to get their approval -for a price. Yep, these two became a premium ad service on a royal scale, with government officials, foreign ambassadors, and even royalty going through the Mons channel to get their desires approved by the Tsar through Catherine. All for a price of course. \n\n\nSo, what's this about rumors of adultery? Well, there were rumors. A common one floating around St. Petersburg was that Peter caught Mons and Catherine doing the dirty under a moonlit sky in the garden. However since Peter's wrath was brought against Mons in November, it's unlikely this is true as the garden would have been under a layer of snow. It's also just flat-out unlikely for either Mons or Catherine to have done it. Catherine was smart, she knew Peter and knew that fucking the fiscal fraud (it's widely believed she knew of his activities and ignored them) right after he had made her Empress would have been a very poor move. Likewise, it's unlikely someone as sharp as Mons would have done anything so likely to bring attention to his illegal activities. Although frankly, it's amazing Peter was unaware of it as long as he was. \n\n\n\nOnce he found out -likely through an informant who felt burned by Mons- Peter's first move was to ban the passing of any petition that would pardon criminals. Shortly after Mons was arrested and his papers seized. During his interrogation he quickly admitted to his financial corruption. However he was not asked about any illicit visits to Catherine, further evidence that the rumors of adultery were false. Catherine supposed she could save the doomed Mons, but Peter was anything if not a stickler for the law. He had spent his entire reign cracking down on the grossly corrupt Russian bureaucracy and wasn't about to let Mons off now, thought he visited his cell the day before execution and said he was sorry to lose such a talented man. Mons was executed and his sister got the knout. \n\n\n\nNowhere can I find any reputable sources claiming Peter killed Mons over diddling the Empress, nor anything beyond rumors claiming any diddling happened. Also, the source listed by OP claims the Romanov Dynasty lasted from 1613 to 1855, which would imply that Nicholas I was the last Emperor of Russia. Alright, cool. \n\n\n\nAnyway, it is my conclusion that this whole claim is bollocks. Mons was executed for taking part in financial corruption, something that he knew Peter was hellbent on destroying. The claim that they had an affair is entirely usubstantiated by anyone other that unaccredited sensationalists such as St. Petersburg gossip circles and Karl Shaw. Catherine wouldn't be that stupid, Mons wouldn't be that stupid, and this rumor of Peter putting Mon's head in a jar in Catherine's room is pure bullshit. Mon's execution did create considerable tension between them for awhile, but that's all. \n\n\nR5:\n\n\n*Massie, Robert K.. Peter the Great: his life and world. New York: Knopf, 1980.

        "text": "[The offending post.](http://np.reddit.com/r/hinduism/comments/2couum/worlds_most_ancient_vishnu_deity_discovered_in/) It is a link to an article which says that an ancient Vishnu head was discovered in Oc Eco, Vietnam dating back to 4000-5000 years,and implying that 'vedic culture' was present in Vietnam 4000-5000 years ago.\n\nThe main arguments of the badhistory there:\n&gt;The significance of this discovery cannot be overestimated. The entire history of Hinduism and Vedic culture, as taught is the academic institutions of the world, has been built upon a false construct.  According to mainstream academia Vedic ‘religion’ or Hinduism did not exist until the alleged ‘Aryans’ invaded India circa 1500 BC. An even later date is given to Vaishnavism which is speculated to have been derived from animist Sun worship.  Yet here we have a highly evolved art form depicting Lord Vishnu in the Far South East region of Asia dated to somewhere between 2000 BC to 1500 BC.\n\n&gt;This completely undermines the entire historic timeline developed by mainstream academia in regards to the development of both Vedic/Hindu civilization and Indian history. \n\n&gt;The region of modern India has always been the epicenter of High Vedic/Hindu Civilization and culture. No one anywhere has ever suggested the region of modern Vietnam to be the origin of Hindu civilization yet it is in Vietnam that we now have the world’s most ancient example of Indic style Vedic Vaishnava art. Thus it stands to reason that if Vedic Vaishnava art, culture and religion flourished 4000 years ago in prehistoric Vietnam it was undoubtedly flourishing in ancient India as well.\n\n&gt;Once again science and archeology have confirmed the Vedic conclusion. As the Vedic literature states 5000 years ago India was home to a highly evolved and advanced civilization. This civilization was centered on its sacred traditions. The worship of the Supreme Lord Vishnu, Lord Shiva, Lakshmi and Durga was widespread and in fact spanned the entire globe\n\nQuoting /u/shannondoah in that thread:\n\n&gt;Oc Eco *was* the capital of an Indianised kingdom on the Vietnam region(Kingdom of Funan),and it was an important naval port which flourished from the 1st to 7th centuries AD.Funan's initial capital was Vyadhapura(which later shifted to Oc Eco),and its heavy  Indian influence was due to trade with the Pallava dynasty.  \nAnd Oc Eco *may* have been Kirtinagara(romanised by Ptolemy as Kattigara).  \n\nQuoting /u/vistascan as well here:\n\n&gt;It's [strange](http://books.google.co.in/books?id=QKgraWbb7yoC&amp;pg=PA989&amp;lpg=PA989&amp;dq=Oc+eo+culture+dates&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3XoYI86bUX&amp;sig=oBZ-VD0FZMWIQzobiScQOQKR4M8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=IsDhU7mbGpaLuATn8ILYDQ&amp;ved=0CBoQ6AEwADgU#v=onepage&amp;q=Oc%20eo%20culture%20dates&amp;f=false) how the Oc Eo culture, which flourished from the 1st to 7th centuries AD, has a 4500 year old statue of Vishnu, which even we in India don't have. This kind of pseudo-history does nothing to increase our credibility to the rest of the world. \n\n&gt;The article gives zero sources as to who dated it and where the findings were published. Even other sites from Vietnam [mention](http://en.vietnamplus.vn/Home/Oc-Eo-civilisations-artifacts-unearthed/20146/52161.vnplus) that the culture was much more recent. \n\n&gt;Apparently Hinduism loses all it's value unless it's 5000 years or older, evidence be damned. \n\nAlso quoting /u/valarauko in that thread:\n\n&gt;On the face (!!!) of it, the head more closely resembles Shiva than Vishnu, with the linga-like headdress, popular in South Indian bronzes. That makes sense since the region had close ties with South India. The helmet like *mukuta* is iconography borrowed from the Scythians, and popularized in the Gupta era. The 4500 old imagery that looks post Gupta just doesn't make sense.\n\nOh,about what /u/shannondoah mentioned about the AIT(Aryan Invasion theory),there is this [link](http://np.reddit.com/r/SouthAsianHistory/comments/29g4du/ancient_indian_historiography/) by /u/shannondoah elaborating a number of controversies in ancient Indian archeology,which I am reproducing here verbatim.\n\n&gt;* The Aryan invasion debate in India is intensely relevant to the\nconstructions of several very different sets of competing identities:Hindu and Muslim, indigene and foreigner, Aryan and Dravidian, and Hindu\ncommunal and Marxist secularist are all permeated in one way or another with a variety\nof notions connected with Aryan origins.\n* There is a tendency to stereotype any local reconsiderations of ancient Indian history\nwhatsoever as nationalist or communal,which is often unfortunate.A\nwide variety of motives inspire Indian scholars to revisit the topic of Indo-Aryan ori-\ngins: it is erroneous to lump them all into a simplistic, hastily identified and easily\ndemonized Hindutva category.\n* Nationalist historiography is *not* necessarily bad. It has stimulated asking questions about local cultural and ethnic configurations that would not have occurred to colonially oriented archaeologists. It has brought different assumptions, perspectives,and concerns to the data, exposed colonial predispositions and imperial biases.\nOn the negative side, nationalism has encouraged the misinterpretation of archaeological data for political purposes and ignored important aspects of human history Archaeological interpretation can reinforce and articulate the centralizing policies of emerging nationalisms, as well as be used to legitimize ethnic cleansing or territorial expansion.I'm citing Harke (1991) here.Silberman(1995) also suggests a similar thesis.\n* Now, voices challenging the *invasion* thesis,Indian or foreign,need *not* be communal,which they unfortunately tend to get stereotyped.This is not to say that there are people who seek \nthis theory for very overt politics.\n* To be considered a real Hindu, a person's religious faith\nmust have an indigenous origin.-is the crux of Savarkar's Hindutva.The problem with this seemed to be that it appeared to exclude native Muslims and Christians on the virtue of the fact that their prophets were born on the wrong side of the Indus. This[ideology of Hindutva] has a number of consequences in the way these people have dealt with the Aryan *Invasion* theory.\n* Extreme versions of this have lead to all sorts of nationalistic nosenscical viewpoints,like *England* was *Angulisthana* originally or *Arabia* was *Arvasthana*,or Muhammad was a Hindu(of the sort produced by PN Oak) to include Muslims as 'Hindus' and thus,Indian citizens.Similar nonsense is spouted by Tamil nationalists as well.\n* Hindutva ideology(since I'm talking about it here) can be easily pressed into service in alienating and targeting the Muslims and other minorities in communally volatile, modern-day India.(Hock,1999;Habib;1997,Ananth;1998)\n* However,there is  a tendency in Western, and in elements of Indian, academic circles to a priori stereotype everyone reconsidering this aspect of Indian history in such ways(like fascists and Nazis:This is particularly strong in places like the universities of Delhi),which has been greatly vexing to scholars like Colin Renfrew, B B Lal,etc.\n*The point is that: themes resonating with Hindutva, that is, the prioritizing of Hindu culture as the indigenous, and therefore legitimate, heir to hegemonic power in India (with its anti-Muslim subtext), while blatantly and distastefully present in a number of publications, does not pervade the views of all the members of the Indigenous Aryan school.\n* You've already mentioned Arun Shourie ,and the controversies in the Indian Council of Historical Research.The \"Left-liberal\" or \"secular Marxist\" stereotype is subject to an amount of disgust equal to that of the colonial stooge in Indigenist discourse. Rajaram (1995) states that \"in the hands of politically driven historians of post-colonial India, these nineteenth century-creations [viz., arguments supporting the Aryan invasion theory] have become handy tools to be used in support of their vested interest in Marxist ideology and the version of history that goes with it\" (xiv). 20 Secular Marxists are accused of maintaining a defunct theory in order to insist that the arrival of the Aryans is analogous to the arrival of the Muslims, Christians, and numerous other groups of newcomers to the subcontinent. In such an amalgamation of immigrants, no one has more claim to indig- enous pedigree or cultural hegemony than anyone else. A secular state, from this perspective, is the only political system that can protect the equal rights of all citizens to define themselves as being Indian with cultural credentials that are as good as anybody else's.\n* Thapar's comments are portrayed as \"vintage Marxist rhetoric,\" which has \"gratuitously drag[ed] in the bogey of the 'Aryan nation' . . . [as] a blatant attempt aimed at divert-\ning attention away from the real issue\" (Rajaram 1993, 33). Thapar (1996) finds Rajaram's writings \"read rather like nineteenth century tracts but peppered with ref- erences to using the computer so as to suggest scientific objectivity since they claim that it is value-free! Those that question their theories are dismissed as Marxists\" (88). From another perspective on the other side of the debate, and in interesting contrast to Thapar's concern about a single \"Aryan nation,\" Talageri (1993) raises the alarm about multiple Marxist mininations: \"The first principle of Leftist propaganda is that India is not a nation but a conglomerate of nations. . . . the rationale behind this is that if India breaks up into small \"nations,\" these would be easier for the Leftists to gobble up one by one\" .  \n**Both sides of the debate sometimes refuse to even acknowledge that there is a legitimate controversy,sadly.**\n* An example of the ridiculousness this reached: The entire proceedings at the plenary session of the prestigious 1994 World Archaeological Congress in Delhi came to a complete (and ridiculous) standstill for more than thirty minutes as \"leftist\" and \"rightist\" historians actually clambered onto the dais, physically wrestled each other in attempts to snatch up the microphone, and hurled abuse into the air in front of over two hundred flabbergasted foreign delegates.\n* Detractors of the Indigenist school can be just as selective in the views they extract for critique, as the Indigenists they ridicule. Habib (1997) caricatures all the Indigenous Aryanists as believing that the Dravidian language family is not distinct from the Indo-Aryan one—a view held by only a very few individuals and not at all representative of the Indigenous position.Scholars like Satya Swarup Mishra(linguistics at BHU) who abhor Hindutva,face immense frustration at this stereotyping.\n* There is no indication that the British consciously exploited the Aryan theory to create a divide-and-rule situation between the North and the South. However, whatever may have been the motives of colonial scholars or missionaries, the dichotomy was most certainly put to political use by separatist voices in the South of India.(Tamil Nationalism,theories of Kumari Kandam,etc).\n* Western scholars are often caricatured as discouraging the tribes and\nlower-ranking castes from identifying with Brahman-dominated Hinduism, gaining their sympathy, and offering them a new set of loyalties in the form of Christianity.\n* There are a number of scholars who outline the arguments in favor of the\nexternal origin of the Aryans, as well as the arguments that oppose it(in contrast to the shrill and often unpleasant and exclusionary *Hindutva* polemicists), but leave the issue unresolved—in other words, the Indigenous Aryan position is treated on equal terms with the standard version of events: \"European scholars have been trying to prove that the Aryans came to India from outside and their guesses have extended to all sorts of places like Scandinavia, Austria, Czechoslovakia, Russia, Turkey, Central Asia and Armenia. But any of these places cannot yet be said to really be the homeland of the Aryans. We are still in the realm of speculation and are likely to remain so\" (Vidyarthi 1970).Also see RC Majumdar. \n* A third category of writers gives the Indigenous Aryan school equal and respectful time but passes a verdict against them(Like Kosambi and Luniya)\n* A final category—more ideologically sensitive and, as as has\nbeen exemplified earlier, usually stereotyped as the Marxist camp—actively opposes the Indigenous Aryan school.\n* Ancient Indian pre- and protohistory is an extremely rich and fascinating area of\nstudy, but, unfortunately, the origin of the Indo-Aryans has become inextricably enmeshed with the politics of representation. There is every reason to be concerned that if the Vedic Indo-Aryans are interpreted as being indigenous to India, then the Vedic \"civilization\" and all that developed from it will be construed as \"truly Indian\" and all subsequent cultural groups known to have immigrated into India could explicitly or implicitly be depicted as \"Others.\"\n* If you ask me about what position *I* take on this stance,I'd be leaning towards Majumdar's position,or a bit more towards Kosambi's That\nthey are open to different interpretations does not at all mean that the Indigenist position can carry the day. But, to my mind, it does mean that an Indigenous position merits a place at the table.\n\n\n&gt;This is from the chapter 'Aryan Origins and Modern Nationalist Dialogue' from Edwin Bryant's 'The quest for the origins of Vedic Culture'.\n\n\nI hope I have done well.",

        "text": "Hey guys,\n\nSo first off, Waterloo (1970) is a brilliant film and you should all watch it because it's awesome. That and Christopher Plummer makes a great a Duke of Wellington. \n\n[If you watch this portion of the film that takes place on the day of the Battle of Waterloo (June 18, 1815), you will notice that there is a small shanty being sung.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdZIOP6N4NU#t=4240)\n\nJust a quick note before I get accused of molding the offending piece to suit my post: there seems to be a number of variations of this shanty, including: [this](http://altefritz.blogspot.com/2012/12/boney-was-warrior.html), [this](http://www.shanty.org.uk/archive_songs/boney.html), and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrjl2h4Zo5U) and  other than a few  dissimilarities, they are pretty much the same piece. As an example of the variance within some versions of the song, some versions include \"Boney fought the Prooshians\" on its own while others have the verse \"The Austrians and Prooshians.\" \n\nOther than the fact for some reason they're pronouncing \"Francois\" in a very weird way even for an English accent, you'll notice that all these shanties have one thing in common: They go through Napoleon's life from start to finish--May 1821. \n\nThe shanty itself is called \"Boney was a Warrior\" and seems to originate in the early 1800's according to shanty.org.uk. However, it would be nice to have a better source with more information. [David Cordingly at least seems to say that the shanty is written by an unknown individual, which could make finding the needed information difficult, if true.](http://books.google.com/books?id=a68GeehBGZYC&amp;pg=PT288&amp;dq=boney+was+a+warrior&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Mz7iU8KWG8qtyATJ4ILQBw&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=boney%20was%20a%20warrior&amp;f=false)\n\nGenerally, its lyrics generally go something like this:\n\n\n&gt; Boney was a warrior\n&gt; \n&gt; Away, a-yah!\n&gt; \n&gt; A warrior and a terrier\n&gt; \n&gt; Jean Francois!\n&gt; \n&gt; -\n&gt; \n&gt; Boney fought the Russians\n&gt; \n&gt; Away, a-yah!\n&gt; \n&gt; The Russians and the Prussians.\n&gt; \n&gt; Jean Francois!\n&gt; \n&gt; __\n&gt; \n&gt; Moscow was a-blazing\n&gt; \n&gt; Away, a-yah!\n&gt; \n&gt; And Boney was a-raging.\n&gt; \n&gt; Jean Francois!\n&gt; \n&gt; __\n&gt; \n&gt; Boney went to Elba\n&gt; \n&gt; Away, a-yah!\n&gt; \n&gt; Boney he came back again.\n&gt; \n&gt; Jean Francois!\n&gt; \n&gt; __\n&gt; \n&gt; Boney went to Waterloo\n&gt; \n&gt; Away, a-yah!\n&gt; \n&gt; There he got his overthrow.\n&gt; \n&gt; Jean Francois!\n&gt; \n&gt; __\n&gt; \n&gt; Then they took him off again\n&gt; \n&gt; Away, a-yah!\n&gt; \n&gt; Aboard the Billy Ruffian.\n&gt; \n&gt; Jean Francois!\n&gt; \n&gt; __\n&gt; \n&gt; He went to Saint Helena,\n&gt; \n&gt; Away, a-yah!\n&gt; \n&gt; There he was a prisoner,\n&gt; \n&gt; Jean Francois!\n&gt; \n&gt; __\n&gt; \n&gt; Boney broke his heart and died\n&gt; \n&gt; Away, a-yah!\n&gt; \n&gt; Away in Saint Helena\n&gt; \n&gt; Jean Francois!\n\nOther versions \n\nAs a comparison, the shanty.co.uk version adds some verses about Waterloo, and its aftermath:\n\n&gt; They sent him off to Elbow.\n&gt; \n&gt; He came back to make another show\n&gt; \n&gt; We beat him at Trafalgar Bay.\n&gt; \n&gt; Blew his main topmast away\n&gt; \n&gt; __\n&gt; \n&gt; On the plains of Waterloo\n&gt; \n&gt; The Iron Duke he put him through\n&gt; \n&gt; __\n&gt; \n&gt; Boney went a-cruis-eye-ing.\n&gt; \n&gt; Aboard the Billy Ruffian\n&gt; \n&gt; __\n&gt; \n&gt; The sent him off to Saint Helenn\n&gt; \n&gt; He never never came back again\n&gt; \n&gt; __\n&gt; \n&gt; The sent him into exile.\n&gt; \n&gt; He died on St Helena's isle\n&gt; \n&gt; __\n&gt; \n&gt; Boney broke his heart and died\n&gt; \n&gt; On Corsica he wished he'd stayed\n&gt; \n&gt; __\n&gt; \n&gt; Boney was a general,\n&gt; \n&gt; A rorty, snorty general,\n&gt; \n&gt; __\n&gt; \n&gt; Boney was a warrior, \n&gt; \n&gt; Wey, hay, yah\n&gt; \n&gt; A warrior, a tarrier, \n&gt; \n&gt; John François\n\n\nTherefore, because of the contents of the shanty, I do not think it would be possible for it to exist in the 1815. Not to mention it would be quite odd, I think. Yet, on top of that, there is a more conceiving reason for why you wouldn’t see a land regiment singing *Boney was a Warrior.*\n\n*Boney was a Warrior*  couldn’t have been sung at the Battle of Waterloo, or any other battle or drill taking place on land because it was a *sea* shanty. Like many shanties, *Boney was a Warrior* used a [call and response](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_and_response_\\(music\\)) format whereby one person would say one line, and the rest of the crew or others present would answer with the succeeding line. \n\n[Example](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_shanty#Form)\n\n&gt; **Shantyman (solo):** Boney was a warrior,\n&gt; \n&gt; **All (refrain):** Way-ay-ya,\n&gt; \n&gt; **Shantyman (solo):** A reg'lar bull and tarrier,\n&gt; \n&gt; **All (refrain):** John François!\n\n### Some Sexy Sources\n\nhttp://books.google.com/books?id=54wWAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA120&amp;dq=boney+was+a+warrior&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Mz7iU8KWG8qtyATJ4ILQBw&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=boney%20was%20a%20warrior&amp;f=false\n\nhttp://books.google.com/books?id=0Vo62GFJlpoC&amp;pg=PA201&amp;dq=boney+was+a+warrior+shanty&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=QjjiU7qlHcqgyASe5oG4Dg&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=boney%20was%20a%20warrior%20shanty&amp;f=false\n\nhttp://books.google.com/books?id=BTLNAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA213&amp;dq=boney+was+a+warrior+shanty&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=QjjiU7qlHcqgyASe5oG4Dg&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=boney%20was%20a%20warrior%20shanty&amp;f=false\n\nhttp://thejovialcrew.com/?page_id=2493 \n\n**Edit:** /u/rittermeister just provided somne more information regarding the bad history:\n\n&gt; [In fact, it's my understanding that proper sea shanties, as we understand them, are A) post-Napoleonic, and B) more associated with merchant sailors than any navy. This makes it to my mind even more dubious that British soldiers would have sung it, as they would have to have A) traveled forward in time, and B) associated with merchant sailors, or at least worked on the docks. You might as well say that there's no strong evidence that Bonny Prince Charlie didn't go into battle singing \"Scotland the Brave.\"](http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2cskxc/singing_shanties_at_waterloo_or_how_king_edward/cjiv8cs?context=10000)\n\nAlso from the wiki page on sea shanties:\n\n&gt; One of the earliest published uses of this term for such a song came in G. E. Clark's Seven Years of a Sailor's Life, 1867.[5] Narrating a voyage in a clipper ship from Bombay to New York in the early 1860s, Clark wrote, \"The anchor came to the bow with the chanty of 'Oh, Riley, Oh,' and 'Carry me Long,' and the tug walked us toward the wharf at Brooklyn.\"[6] While telling of another voyage out of Provincetown, Mass. in 1865, he wrote:\n\n",

        "text": "I didn't watch the Animaniacs growing up, but that doesn't mean I can't appreciate them now. I like that they have a multitude of educational songs on a number of topics, including history and geography. There's also [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM-igYjn6E4) about the life and times of one Ferdinand Magellan. It's very fun. Go enjoy it. Oh, go on. I'll wait. \n\nReady? Right. I'm sorry to say that the song is not entirely accurate. Oh sure, it's a lovely introduction to Magellan, and it's definitely fun to sing along to (I know it's been stuck in my head for the last couple of days), but it's not completely accurate. \n\nMagellan, for instance, while not really knowing what lay ahead of him, did know roughly what South America looked like and that there was a difference between Argentina and the East Indies. In trying to avoid Portuguese ships off the coast of Brazil, Magellan ended up going south to Argentina and spending the winter of 1520 in Patagonia in a small settlement called Puerto San Julian. During this winter, Magellan faced mutiny from three of the five captains under his command (the captains of the *Victoria,* *Concepcion,* and *San Antonio*). Of these mutineers, many were executed or marooned, but others were forgiven and kept on due to their usefulness. Presumably, though, it's thanks to these mutinies that Magellan would have \"chopped down the mast.\"\n\nAfter leaving Patagonia, Magellan did find a passage through to the Pacific Ocean. This passage is prone to storms and unpredictable winds to such an extent that the Pacific Ocean, in comparison, seemed exceptionally and beautifully calm, prompting Magellan to label it the *Mar Pacifico*. Along the way, though, the *Santiago* was lost in a storm. The other ship Magellan lost, however, was not lost in a storm as the song suggests. Instead, the captain of the *San Antonio* decided he'd had enough of this adventure business and deserted the expedition, heading back to Spain. The expedition briefly followed the Chilean coast, though Magellan almost certainly realised that Chile as well wasn't the East Indies. He wasn't that lost.\n\nThe same is the case with Guam. Magellan reached Guam on 6 March 1521 and knew that that, too, was not the East Indies. One of the main records we have about Magellan's voyage other than the ships' logs comes from Antonio Pigafetta, a Venetian scholar who travelled along with the expedition as a *sobrasaliente*, or general assistant person. He recorded a great deal about the geography, flora and fauna, climate, weather, people, and everything in between that the expedition encountered. As far as Guam goes, he carefully recorded that the inhabitants were \"poor, but ingenious and very thievish,\" and that they \"entered the ships and stole whatever they could lay their hands on.\" Magellan left Guam rather quickly.\n\nOn 17 March, the expedition reached the Philippines, and it's here that history really deviates from the song. The song states that the inhabitants immediately attacked and killed Magellan, but this is a bit of an over-simplification. Magellan made friends with Rajah Siaiu of Mazauza first, trading with him and communicating through Magellan's Malay slave, Enrique. Hardly entirely unfriendly.\n\nOn 7 April, they travelled on to the island of Cebu where they once again received a warm welcome from the rulers. Rajah Humabon and his wife, Hara Amihan even converted to Christianity, along with several hundred of the native Cebuanos. They were also given an image of Christ (now called the Santo Nino de Cebu) and a big cross (Magellan's Cross). Hostilities don't start until Rajah Humabon brought up the subject of difficulties he had been having with a leader of another nearby island. The local leader had been raiding shipping lines and generally causing problems for the lords of Cebu. Given that Cebu had become a massive trading centre in the region, this was an obvious problem. Humabon asked for help in dealing with this problem. Magellan was eventually persuaded to get involved and sail to the nearby island of Mactan to deal with Rajah Lapu-Lapu.\n\nI'd like to go on a brief tangent from Magellan to talk a bit about Rajah Lapu-Lapu as he's considered one of the first Filipino heroes. It's also debated what exactly the relationship between Lapu-Lapu and Humabon was. Lapu-Lapu first received Mactan as a gift from Humabon with the intention that he would farm it and make it prosperous. This might suggest - and Magellan likely saw it as such - that Lapu-Lapu was a lesser ruler than Humabon. However, this works off a European model of a lord and vassals, which wasn't the case in this particular area. Rather, the region could be seen as being a loose collection of city-states, with each ruler ruling their own area without control over another. Because of this, Humabon would have had no real control over Lapu-Lapu, thus necessitating violence. \n\nAll of this is relevant, I swear. When Magellan arrived at Mactan, one of his demands was that Lapu-Lapu swear fealty to Humabon as well as to the king of Spain, Charles I. Considering the social and political structure of the area, this would have been unthinkable and insulting, and undoubtedly contributed to Lapu-Lapu not being a terribly big fan of Magellan. Magellan, perhaps still hoping to cow Lapu-Lapu into submission, elected to try and win the battle without the help of Humabon's troops, instead charging on to Mactan with himself and forty-nine other heavily armoured Spaniards. All this really succeeded in accomplishing, though, was pissing off Lapu-Lapu and his warriors, who then charged. Recognising Magellan as the leader, they focused their attention on him, striking him with poisoned arrows, bamboo spears, and cutlasses. Magellan dead, the rest of the Spaniards fled back to Cebu, eventually going on to find the East Indies and circumnavigate the globe without Magellan. \n\nInteresting things happened after the Battle of Mactan, however. One of these was the poisoning of twenty-sever Spaniards by Humabon. Why Humabon did this is a matter of quite a bit of debate, with some theories being that it was an act to try and free the enslaved Enrique, while other theories say it was retribution for the Spaniards raping local women. Regardless, it prompted the Spaniards to continue on their merry way once more. Another interesting outcome was that Lapu-Lapu and Humabon resolved their differences and became friends once again. \n\nThe moral of the story is that the Animaniacs are great, but that they sometimes brush over the intricacies of history. That said, without the Animaniacs, I would never have looked into what exactly happened with Magellan in the Philippines, so even bad history (or at least, simplified history) has a place, even if that place is to prompt us to learn more. Also, it's fun to sing. More history should be fun to sing.",

        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2cngo5/a_film_review_of_genghis_khan_1965/",
        "text": "**Introduction**\t\nIn 1965 Columbia Pictures released Genghis Khan a joint American-British-Yugoslavian production. This film came nine years after the last big budget Hollywood attempt at making a movie about Genghis Khan. The result of that effort was the Conqueror which starred John Wayne as Temujin. The film was famous not only for its bizarre casting but also for its irradiated shooting locations and sets (probably shouldn’t have shot downwind of an above ground nuclear test site) which caused many of the cast and crew to develop cancer. The 1965 film had none of radioactive shenanigans of the John Wayne film but it did make up for it with equally bizarre casting. In the title role of Temujin/Genghis Khan was Omar Sharif, Genghis Khan’s wife Borte was played by French actress Francoise Dorleac. In the role of Temujin’s rival Jamuka was Stephen Boyd. The Chinese Emperor and his ambassador were played by British actors Robert Morley and James Mason respectively. Telly Savalas played a henchman of Genghis Khan and Eli Wallach portrayed a rather entertaining Shah of Khwarezm. Certainly the casting is strange, but that can be forgiven if the other details such as the costuming, the sets and the story are historically accurate, right? How close did this production come to resembling actual history?  To quote the New York Times, “Aside from the name of the title character, it is no closer to history than Omar Sharif is to being a Mongolian.” \n \nI will be extensively summarizing this film as it seems that it is not as well known or viewed as the more modern films reviewed here. If this assumption is wrong, I apologize. \n\n**Summary and Review**\n\nThe film opens with a small party of Mongols moving across the steppe. The opening narration reveals that these people are lead by Yesugei and he has a son named Temujin. We also find out that the narrator is an old man who is apparently close to Temujin. The trip is cut short by an ambush by an army of horsemen. After several shots of fighting, the horsemen prove triumphant and we cut to Yesugei being brought up to the leader of the horsemen.  The leader identifies himself as Jamuka of the Merkids. \n\n&gt; * Jamuka was a member and eventual khan of the Jadaran clan and not the Merkids. He was slightly older than Temujin and they were childhood friends and playmates. This is not reflected in the movie as Jamuka in this case is a fully grown man while Temujin is still a teenager. Furthermore Jamuka was not initially adversarial towards Temujin; in fact, Jamuka and Temujin were childhood friends and playmates. The bond between the two was so close that they swore to be blood brothers (anda is the term in Mongolian). This bond was reaffirmed in adulthood when Jamuka aided Temujin in launching a raid against the Merkids to retrieve his kidnapped wife. Sadly the friendship did not survive the growing ambitions of both men and it eventually ended in open military conflict between the two.\n\nJamuka states that Yesugei was trespassing on his grazing lands and has him drawn and quartered.  A captive Temujin breaks free and attacks Jamuka who in turn subdues and chokes Temujin with the intent to kill. The old man states that there is a prophecy which states that he who kills Yesugei’s son will in turn die. Jamuka lets Temujin live but orders him to be fitted with a cangue (a giant wooden collar which also binds the hands) and be enslaved. \n\n&gt; * The death of Temujin’s father and the aftermath played out much differently. Yesugei was not drawn and quartered by the Merkids but rather poisoned by Tartars; this was in revenge for Yesugei’s military campaigns against the tribe. Upon Yesugei’s death, his retainers abandoned their khan’s widows and underage children and took Yesugei’s herd of cattle with them. Due to this treachery, Temujin’s family had to subsist on hunting small game and fishing. It was a precarious existence to say the least; the family was clothed in the furs of whatever they could kill such as dog and mice and their newfound roles as hunters put them at the bottom of the social totem pole (with herders being at the top). \n* The retainers had thrown in their lot with the Tayichi’ut clan and the leader of the Tayichi’ut clan Targutai usurped Yesugei’s title as leader of the Borjigin clan.  Unfortunately this claim was threatened by the continued survival of Temujin and his family. Targutai found an opportunity to seize Temujin and end all threats to his power when Temujin killed his elder half brother in a dispute over food and control of the family. Using this crime as an excuse, Targutai had Temujin enslaved and placed in a cangue.\n\nTemujin grows up in a montage to become Omar Sharif. We cut to a river and a collection of young people run by Temujin and his mute companion Sengal. One member of the group, a blonde woman, drops a ball in the river and Temujin retrieves it. They have a romantic moment. Jamuka rides in and establishes that the blonde woman in Borte, his betrothed.  He sends off Borte and her companions and then proceeds to whip Temujin. Temujin tricks Jamuka into removing the cangue and Temujin escapes into the lush forests of Mongolia. He evades his pursuers by jumping off a waterfall; he survives without a scratch and is soon joined by Sengal and his old mentor Geen. Geen explains that the tribes of the steppe are sandwiched between a prosperous west marked by cities such as Samarkand and Bukhara and an even more prosperous east represented by the kingdom of China. The Mongols are poor because they constantly war with each other. Upon learning this news, Temujin vows to unite the Mongols under his standard. \n\n&gt; * According to Secret History of the Mongols, Temujin escaped from the cangue with the help of a sympathetic Tayichi’ut vassal. The duration of his imprisonment is disputed and it is unclear if Temujin had one captor or if he was shuffled between multiple captors. Whatever the case, Temujin escaped and began rebuilding the fortunes of his family. This began with his marriage to Borte. \n* Borte was the daughter of the chief of the Qongirat tribe and Yesugei had affianced the two at a young age. Once Temujin had reached adulthood, he returned to the Qongirat and the two were married. It was perhaps the most boring and drama free episode in Temujin’s life.\t\n* Temujin was the descendant of Qabul Khan who had united the Mongols under one standard in the early 12th century; his empire had only recently shattered due to constant feuding between the various clans that comprised it. Temujin, Jamuka and other ambitious Mongols all strived to recapture the glory of Qabul Khan. In short, Mongol unity was not a new idea.\n\nTemujin makes his home in a rocky vale which the Merkids don’t enter because they believe the area is haunted. Temujin spies a passing Merkid slave caravan and engages in some tactical espionage action (he sneaks around the Merkid camp with a bush held up in front of his face). He frees the slaves and together they overpower the Merkid guards. The slaves join with Temujin and they in turn attack a Khwarezmi slave caravan and liberate some women to serve as wives for the band. Temujin is told by Geen to seek a wife of his own. We cut to Borte’s tent; Temujin cuts his way in and kidnaps Borte.  After some testy back and forth between the two in Temujin’s tent, Borte gives into Temujin’s advances. \n\n&gt; * As aforementioned, Temujin and Borte were betrothed to each other and the marriage went through without a hitch. Temujin’s early career was not as a bandit as depicted in this movie. Upon marrying Borte, Temujin swore his allegiance to Toghrul, ruler of the Keirat Confederation. Toghrul had been the blood brother of Yesugei and Yesugei had helped Toghrul regain his throne after being deposed by his family. Temujin too would help Toghrul in preserving his throne from challenges posed by his family.\n\nJamuka wonders how Temujin managed to infiltrate his camp and how Borte was kidnapped from under the noses of her three brothers. He grows suspicious of them and he follows them as they are taken to Temujin’s camp. The three brothers are introduced as Subutai, Jebe and Khasar. Subutai is established as brilliant but quick tempered and impetuous. Later, Borte is washing at the nearby waterfall when she is ambushed by Jamuka and taken back to camp. Borte’s discarded coat is found by Sengal and is presented to Temujin. Temujin realizes that Jamuka has found their camp and captured Borte. He tells most of his band to head eastward into China while he and a small group of followers rescue Borte. He manages to save Borte in a nighttime raid and Temujin and company heads eastward. \n\n&gt; * Borte was kidnapped by the Merkids. Kidnapping women was a common means of acquiring a bride on the steppe and indeed Temujin’s father Yesugei had stolen Temujin’s mother Hoelun from the Merkids. Temujin rallied his blood brother Jamuka as well as his father’s blood brother Toghrul to aid him in rescuing Borte. The raid proved successful and Temujin was reunited with his wife who revealed that she was pregnant. Temujin treated the resulting child, Jochi, as his own though Jochi’s paternity would always haunt him and deprive him of his right to succeed his father as his eldest son. The movie is accurate enough to show that Temujin was accepting of the child regardless of the paternity and that this paternity issue would be used to slander him.\n* Subutai, Jebe and Khasar were all companions and generals of Temujin; they were not the brothers of Borte however. Subutai was the brother of one of Temujin’s oldest companions Jelme. Jebe was a Tayichi’ut warrior who ended up in Temujin’s service and Khasar was Temujin’s younger brother. \n\nIn China, Temujin and company run across the Chinese diplomat named Kam Ling. He explains that he has been stranded due to a broken wagon; Temujin offers to escort Kam Ling to the Chinese capital at Peking and does so. Temujin and company marvel at Chinese technology and prosperity but are worried about growing soft and fat. Borte also gives birth to a son; Temujin accepts the son as his own despite the questionable paternity. He calls the son Jochi. Temujin is brought in to meet with the Chinese emperor.  Temujin reveals his intention to unite the tribes of the Mongols underneath his banner and the emperor states that the quarreling of the steppe nomads keeps China safe and he has no intention of letting Temujin’s vision come to fruition. He ‘invites’ Temujin to stay by taking away his horses and stationing 3000 men to guard Peking’s walls (though he does provide the band with fine quarters). Temujin vows to keep his men sharp until they can escape and so he institutes daily training (of shirtless sword fighting) for his troops. \n\n&gt; * China at this point was divided into three states; the southernmost entity was the remnants of the Song dynasty. The Jurchen or Jin Dynasty controlled most of modern day China north of the Yangtze River. A small Tangut kingdom was located west of the Jurchen Dynasty’s lands. Of note is the fact that the Jurchen Dynasty had its origins in Manchuria; the people of Manchuria led a similar pastoral existence as the Mongols, though by the time of Genghis Khan the ruling dynasty had lost most of its nomadic roots. This film is accurate in describing the Jin policy; the Jurchen policy was to keep the nomads fighting so they did not have the strength to invade Jurchen lands. Temujin’s ally (and liege lord) Toghrul was a vassal of the Jurchen state and they used him to control the Tartars on their border. During the time of Qabul Khan, the Jin policy was to pit the Tartars against the Mongols. \n* Jamuka and Temujin had a falling out around 1185 and soon after met in battle. The Secret History of the Mongols stated that Temujin was defeated. The next mention of Temujin’s whereabouts occur in 1195 when he raised an army to restore Toghrul to his throne after he had been deposed by the neighboring Naiman confederacy. Secret History of the Mongols is silent about that ten year gap; historian Paul Ratchnevsky proposed that Temujin spent those years in the Jurchen Empire as a slave and Secret History omitted that episode due to the embarrassing nature of Temujin’s state during that time. I have not managed to get a hold of Ratchnevsky’s work and so I don’t know how well it is supported by evidence or whether this view has been accepted by other historians. In short, this film may be accurate in depicting Temujin fleeing to China.\n\nJamuka invades China; he routs the Chinese army and seizes a major city. Temujin offers to raise an army to defeat Jamuka and he dispatches his brother in laws with gold to achieve this task. Temujin’s new army meets Jamuka in battle. Temujin orders his Chinese contingent to feign retreat to lure Jamuka into an ambush and Jamuka takes the bait. Temujin’s army attacks Jamuka on both flanks and crushes the Merkids. Jamuka is brought back to Peking in chains and the Chinese emperor bestows Temujin with the title Genghis Khan as a reward for his victory. \n\n&gt; * This is the first major battle scene in the movie and it mostly disappoints. The Mongols are best known for their skills as horse archers. That is not depicted in the movie. The army raised by Temujin is mostly composed of lancers and all the combat shown thus far is mounted melee. The only people who engage in horse archery are the Chinese contingent of Temujin’s army and they only loose one volley before retreating. All further combat will only involve mounted melee. \n* The most egregious error is that Genghis Khan got his title in the service of the Chinese empire. Temujin received the title from his fellow Mongols in a joint assembly known as a kurultai in 1206. This process was the culmination of clever political maneuvering and military skill.  He not only had to fight and subdue his traditional enemies such as the Tartars, Merkids and Tayichi’uts but also had to deal with betrayal from his own ally Toghrul. This betrayal nearly ended Temujin’s career and it was only through the loyalty of his men and the fickleness of steppe politics that brought him back from the brink.\n\nA celebration of the victory soon follows but it is abruptly interrupted by a massive explosion. Temujin investigates and finds out that it was a failed fireworks display set up by two alchemists. He is intrigued by the black powder used in the explosion and asks for a demonstration. He is impressed by the powder and he learns that the Chinese only use it for entertainment. He orders Geen to learn the secrets of gunpowder. We cut to a scene at a market. Jamuka is in a cangue and caged; he sees Borte and Jochi. Borte and Jamuka make eye contact and she hurries away. Later, Borte proposes that Temujin ally with Jamuka and thereby achieve the dream of uniting the Mongol tribes under one banner. After initial resistance, Temujin agrees to the idea and approaches Jamuka with the proposal. Jamuka refuses and is returned to his cage. Temujin tells his the Chinese emperor that he intends to leave to Mongolia but the emperor refuses; Temujin also invites the emperor to a fireworks display and leaves. The emperor privately tells Kam Ling that since Temujin has seen China for what it is (weak but rich) he will most likely return as a conqueror if he ever leaves. He plans to address the Temujin problem with the help of Jamuka. Kam Ling betrays the emperor and reveals theplan of using Jamuka to assassinate Temujin. Jamuka then escapes his cangue and cage. Temujin uses the fireworks display as a cover to mine the gates of Peking with black powder. He tricks the emperor into lighting the black powder; the resulting explosion kills the emperor and blows open the gates of Peking. Temujin escapes with his men through the breach. He then orders his brother in laws to begin the conquest of Russia, India and China. We don’t see any conquering but in a voiceover we are told that the Mongol armies have conquered Russia, India and China up till the Yellow River. \n\n&gt; * The idea that the Chinese did not use gunpowder for anything but entertainment is one of those bizarre European caricatures of other cultures. Gunpowder had been in the Chinese repertoire since the Tang Dynasty and the military thinkers since then had been conceiving new and interesting ways to apply the ‘fire drug’ to killing people. The Chinese initially attached gunpowder to arrows or delivered gunpowder and incendiaries via catapult; the Song Dynasty utilized gunpowder weapons in their fight against the Jurchens and the Jurchens in turn utilized gunpowder against the Mongols. The Mongols then picked up the secrets of gunpowder from captured Chinese specialists. \n* Genghis Khan invaded the Jurchen Empire in 1210. India was never conquered by the Mongol Empire (though raided repeatedly) and the conquest of Russia occurred primarily under Temujin’s successors.  Jamuka was dead and the Mongols were united before any of these conquests had happened.\n\nJamuka has joined with the Shah of Khwarezm and he goads him into attacking Temujin. Temujin once again offers Jamuka a place at his side. Jamuka refuses again and the battle begins. Temujin decimates Jamuka’s horsemen with cart mounted cannons and Temujin’s own horsemen attack Jamuka’s flanks. Jamuka cuts down the Shah of Khwarezm after the Shah orders a retreat and he rallies his troops to continue the fight. Subutai is killed in the melee but the Mongols are triumphant. The defeated Jamuka then challenges Temujin to a duel. Temujin wins the duel but is mortally wounded. On his deathbed he sees all the Mongol people come together. The film then ends with his funeral procession and a voiceover explaining the successes of his descendants. \n\n&gt; * Jamuka was handed over to Temujin by his own men in 1205. Temujin, who prized loyalty above all else, had these traitors killed and he magnanimously offered to restore Jamuka as his blood brother. Jamuka refused and was executed.\n* Needless to say, Temujin never used field artillery to defeat his foes though the Mongols did deploy gunpowder bombs and incendiaries in sieges.\n* Subutai did not die in combat either. He died of old age after a successful career of campaigning across the length and breadth of Eurasia\n* In the film the Shah of Khwarezm agrees to attack Temujin because of Temujin’s attack on the slave caravan earlier in the film. There is some historical truth to this event as the war between the Mongol Empire and Khwarezm was sparked due to an attack on a caravan; unfortunately, the film has it backwards. A Mongol caravan seeking trade relations with Khwarezm was attacked by the governor of the Khwarezmi city of Otrar and plundered. Genghis Khan’s efforts to peacefully seek compensation and justice for this attack proved unsuccessful and so Temujin destroyed the Khwarezm Empire. \n* Genghis Khan’s death occurred in 1227. There is some dispute between the various sources as whether he was in his 60s or 70s when this occurred (his birth year has been stated as either 1155 or 1162). The Genghis Khan in this film looks no older than his early 30s. Temuin also did not die in a duel; he most likely succumbed to natural causes though there is an apocryphal story that he bled out after being castrated by a Tangut princess he was about to rape.\n\nSources: \n*Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World*.

They resolved their differences like all differences should be resolved-- by beating the shit out of each other and calling the winner right.

He tells of how Cobb played with black children as a boy, had, in Cobb’s words, a “colored mammy,” and was taught to swim by a “black laborer named Uncle Ezra.”  And he tells us about Cobb’s charitable endeavors after his baseball career, and that Cobb employed black workers when he lived in Georgia.\n\nHe also quotes a newspaper article from 1951, late in Cobb’s life, in which Cobb stated that he saw “no reason in the world why we shouldn't compete with colored athletes as long as they conduct themselves with politeness and gentility.”\n\nIn the face of this *insurmountable body of evidence* Fricks expresses his utter bewilderment at how anyone could make the claim that Ty Cobb was in any way prejudiced against black people:\n&gt;I hear a great deal about Cobb’s racism in the present, especially on the Internet, but no one ever has actually have provided factual or even specifics about their racial allegations. If Cobb had been a racist, some newspaperman would have made remarks about the specifics in some way.\n\n&gt;I have over 40,000 newspaper articles, and NOT one article makes any correlation to Ty Cobb being a racist. All the evidence demonstrates Cobb’s support for the advancement of colored people, and yet, there is NO evidence that gives any indication that Mr. Cobb made any movement toward oppressing the black population.\n\nR5 time!\n\n* In spring training of 1907, a black groundskeeper, Bungy Davis, tried to either shake Cobb’s hand or pat him on the shoulder.  Cobb was outraged, slapping Davis in the face and chasing him until Davis’s wife attempted to intervene.  Cobb choked her until Tigers’ catcher Charlie Schmidt pulled him off her and punched him in the face.\n\n* In 1908 in Detroit, Cobb stepped in freshly poured asphalt and a black workman named Fred Collins made his displeasure known.  Cobb punched him the face, knocking him to the ground.  A Detroit judge and likely Tigers’ fan found Cobb guilty of battery, but gave him a suspended sentence.  Cobb paid Collins $75 to avoid a civil suit.\n\n* In 1909 in Cleveland, Cobb was charged with attempted murder after stabbing a black night watchman named George Stansfield.  Stansfield had intervened after Cobb had slapped a black elevator operator.  Cobb’s lawyers, one of whom was a former mayor of Cleveland, managed to get the charges reduced to assault and battery.  Cobb pled guilty and was fined $100.  Stanfield filed a lawsuit, but he and Cobb settled out of court.  (In the comments, Fricks insists, without providing any evidence, that Stansfield was white, and that biographer Charles Alexander knew this but decided to lie about it.)\n\n* In 1912 in New York, Cobb attacked a white man for a change, charging into the stands during the sixth inning and administering a savage beating to heckler Claude Lueker.  The insult that pushed Cobb over the edge?  Lueker called Cobb “a half n*****.”  (Irrelevant to the question of Cobb’s racism: Lueker didn’t have hands.  When the crowd pointed it out, Cobb yelled “I don’t care if he doesn’t have feet.”)  Cobb was suspended ten games for the incident.  “When I spectator calls me a half n****** I think it’s about time to fight,” Cobb told the Detroit Free Press.\n\n*  In 1914 in Detroit, Cobb arrived home with a dinner guest, only to find his wife upset over an argument she had earlier in the day with a local butcher, William Carpenter.  Cobb phoned Carpenter, telling him he was coming to see him in the shop, then grabbed his revolver and headed over.  When Carpenter saw Cobb enter with a gun, he quickly apologized.  Carpenter’s assistant, however, brandished a meat cleaver and advanced on Cobb.  Cobb pistol whipped the assistant while Carpenter called the police.  Cobb spent the night in jail, and although the assistant decided not to press charges – possible Tigers’ fan alert – Carpenter did.  Cobb pled guilty to disturbing the peace and paid a $50 fine.  You will never, ever guess Carpenter’s skin color.\n\n* In 1919 in Detroit, Cobb called hotel chambermaid Ada Morris a n******.  Morris talked back, and Cobb responded by kicking her in the stomach and knocking her down a flight of stairs.  Morris broke a rib and was hospitalized; the hotel manager threw Cobb out.  Morris subsequently filed a $10,000 lawsuit against Cobb.  Though the matter was covered in the black press, it was kept out of the white papers.  Ultimately, Morris was paid an undisclosed sum and dropped the suit.\n\nAt this point, we can only assume that Wesley Fricks is either really, really bad at reading newspapers, or else his stack of 40,000 newspaper articles is not well optimized for searches.  But poor reading comprehension isn’t the only weapon in Fricks’s arsenal – he also likes to claim writers have it out for poor Ty, and have maliciously distorted the record after Cobb’s death.\n\nFricks’s charges here do have a veneer of truth.  Al Stump, the sportswriter who collaborated with Cobb on his autobiography, wrote two more books on Cobb after his death, the last in 1994.  They were ostensibly based on Stump’s time with Cobb, and admissions Cobb supposedly made to him, but had demanded be kept out of the autobiography.  In truth, they were sensationalist bullshit Stump made up to sell books.  Among other things, Stump claimed Cobb confessed that in Detroit in August of 1912, he murdered a man who had attempted to rob him, and left the body in an ally.  An exhaustive search of police and coroner’s office records by a SABR researcher found that no such body ever turned up.  And an exhaustive search of Detroit papers by the same researcher found that, despite a claim by Stump to the contrary, there was never any mention in any Detroit paper of an unidentified body being found in that location in that period.\n\nStump also claimed that Cobb told him that “My father had his head blown off with a shotgun when I was 18 years old—by a member of my own family.”  The issue here isn’t the killing – Cobb’s mother did, in fact, shoot his father to death.  (What, you didn’t think Cobb had a normal home life, did you?)  But according his father’s autopsy, he was killed by pistol rounds.  And according to his mother’s testimony at her trial for voluntary manslaughter, she did indeed shoot him with a pistol, not a shotgun.  (For those keeping score at home, she was acquitted.  Her defense was that she mistook her husband for an intruder.)\n\nWhy would Stump claim it was a shotgun rather than a pistol?  Well, Stump helped himself to a considerable amount of memorabilia on a flimsy pretext after Cobb died, including a shotgun inscribed Tyrus R. Cobb.  Stump not only told people that it was used in Cobb’s father’s murder, but that Cobb had kept the gun, had his own name engraved in it, and frequently used it to go hunting.\n\nSo yeah, Stump was a self-aggrandizing schmuck with zero regard for the truth, and that’s *before* you consider the forgery allegations.\n\nThe trouble is, Cobb’s bad reputation didn’t originate with Stump, nor did those lovely incidents of racially motivated violence.  All of them except for that of Ada Morris, the chambermaid, are recounted in Charles Alexander’s well regarded 1984 biography of Cobb.  (The case of Ada Morris is related in *Baseball: The Golden Age* by Harold Seymour in 1971.)  Alexander relied on interviews with survivors as well as newspapers and public records.  While not perfect – Alexander also erroneously states that Cobb’s father was killed with a shotgun rather than a pistol – it’s the best act in town.\n\nThough Fricks argues valiantly that Cobb’s bad modern reputation is the result of recent fabrications, in truth, it’s nothing new.  Despite his immense talent, he was unpopular with his teammates and widely disliked by his opponents, with legendary manager Connie Mack referring to him as the “dirtiest player in the history of the game.”\n\nTo give the most famous example, in 1910, Cobb was tied for the batting title with Cleveland’s Nap Lajoie going into the last day of the season.  The prize for winning the battle title was a new car, but Cobb was so disliked that the infielders of Cleveland’s opponents, the St. Louis Browns, deliberately played deep, allowing Lajoie to go 8 for 8 in the doubleheader, with *seven infield singles.*\n\nIn other words, the St. Louis Browns allowed an opposing player to get seven free hits just to prevent Ty Cobb from winning a free car.\n\nFinally, a tip of the hat to Rick Brown, a commenter on the linked article who gave the names and stories of people assaulted by Cobb, which made researching this much, much easier than it otherwise would have been.  (It’s much easier to find information on George Stanfield than it is on “that black watchman Ty Cobb stabbed, god what was his name.”)\n\nIn addition to the books I’ve mentioned, I’ve also used the following articles:\n\n[The Knife in Ty Cobb’s Back](http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/the-knife-in-ty-cobbs-back-65618032/) – a Smithsonian article on Stump’s fabrications, also mentions some of Cobb’s actual violence against black people.\n\n[Ty Cobb Did Not Commit Murder](http://research.sabr.org/journals/files/SABR-National_Pastime-16.pdf) – the SABR article debunking Stump’s murder claim\n\n[Stumped by the Storyteller](http://haulsofshame.com/Final%20SABR%20Article%20-%20as%20published_6744.pdf)  -- A thorough debunking of the shotgun question.  (Fricks is thanked for providing, as a representative of the Ty Cobb Museum, copies of Cobb’s father’s autopsy report and records regarding his mother’s trial testimony.  Let no one say I said he was wrong about everything.)\n\nFinally, an epilogue: [Ty Cobb’s Wikipedia Article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ty_Cobb). Go ahead, don’t be shy.  Click it.  Good.  Now scroll down to the sources.  Further down.  No, not that one.  The one that says “Ty Cobb’s label as racist is undeserved, baseball historian says.”\n\nYeah, that’s right.  A [letter to the editor of the Augusta Chronicle](http://chronicle.augusta.com/stories/2004/05/21/let_416281.shtml) by Wesley Fricks is cited on Wikipedia as a source as to whether or not Ty Cobb was racist.\n",

Maybe that gave him a perspective on how Christians screw up that many Christians never get.\"](http://np.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/2cfchw/how_about_a_little_joke/cjf3gbg)\n\nPeople in the comment section, surprisingly, go on to say to the commenter that this a tad illogical, given that CS Lewis was a devout Christian in every way. This part of the book was clearly supposed to illustrate an irony about people who consider themselves good Christians, but end up becoming selfish when they get too caught up in their own afterlife privileges. If anything, the metaphor was probably written to show readers that this is wrong to do as a good Christian, and to encourage faithful people to be less selfish.\n\n[He was a skeptic, even about his own religion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._S._Lewis#Christian_apologist), but there are really no sources that I've found that point out any serious doubts CS Lewis ever had about his own faith. In fact, some of his works like Mere Christianity or The Problem of Pain are specifically written to appeal to reason, and would be angled toward the sort of person that's often found on /r/atheism.\n\nEDIT: Included a permalink to the comment\n\nEDIT 2: As /u/blockbaven pointed out, this actually may be referring to a period of time where CS Lewis was actually an \"atheist living among Christians\" before his conversion and much before writing the Chronicles of Narnia.

        "text": "Before you say anything, I did receive overlord, I mean mod, permission to post this despite the August moratorium.\n\nIn *Guns, Germs, and Steel* Jared Diamond tackles a wide range of subjects to explain the fates of human societies. Despite frustration expressed within the fields of anthropology and history, comprehensive rebuttals of *GG&amp;S* are nonexistent, mostly due to a scholarly hesitance to address topics outside our areas of expertise. To construct a comprehensive review of *GG&amp;S* we need a team of specialists to address misconceptions in their discipline. This post represents the second chapter-specific investigations of *GG&amp;S*. The first post, Chapter 3: Collision at Cajamarca, examined the historical accuracy of Diamond’s re-telling of Pizarro’s invasion of the Inca Empire. This post will examine Chapter 11: Lethal Gift of Livestock. \n\nBefore launching into this discussion, a brief preface. I have no personal vendetta against Diamond. *GG&amp;S* influenced my decision to study anthropology. I loved the book, and it was only in grad school that I realized the systemic issues with Diamond’s thesis and his use of the available data. Though I am somewhat ruthlessly deconstructing this chapter in the name of good (or at least better) history/anthropology, I remain grateful to Diamond for writing something that helped me on my academic journey.\n\n**Lethal Livestock and Shagging Sheep**\n\nDiamond opens the chapter with a fun story of bestiality to establish the, uh, unique bond between humans and their domesticated animals. I’ll just move on. Pathogens can spread through direct contact between the carrier and a susceptible host, or use indirect methods like mosquitoes or contaminated water to find a new host. In discussing indirect methods of pathogen transmission Diamond states parenthetically \n\n&gt; occasionally very indirect, as when U.S. whites bent on wiping out “belligerent” Native Americans sent them gifts of blankets previously used by smallpox patients\n\nThe gift of smallpox blankets has so entered the public consciousness few doubt its veracity. We’ve previously discussed this topic here on /r/badhistory. To completely plagiarize /u/Reedstilt’s post, during the siege of Fort Pitt in June 1763 two Lenape diplomats, Turtle’s Heart and Mamaltee, entered the fort to negotiate the British surrender. Ecuyer and Trent, ranking officers at Fort Pitt, gave the diplomats two blankets and a handkerchief out of the smallpox hospital with the hope of spreading the virus to the surrounding army. General consensus holds smallpox was already circulating through the English and Native American armies before the contaminated gift, therefore the “success” of this biological warfare remains in doubt. Outside the Fort Pitt incident, the only other possible, and probably accidental, instance of contaminated bedding sparking a smallpox epidemic involved the steamboat *St. Peter* on the Missouri River in 1837. There was no official strategy involving the use of smallpox blankets to winnow Native American populations. The one verifiable, intentional incident occurred more than a decade before the signing of the U.S. Declaration of Independence.\n\nAnyway, on to the meat of the chapter…\n\nThe domestic origins of human disease hypothesis predates Diamond’s work. The notes section cites McNeill’s *Plagues and Peoples* as well as Crosby’s *The Columbian Exchange: Biological Consequences of 1492* and *Ecological Imperialism: The Biological Expansion of Europe, 900-1900*. Briefly, the hypothesis states\n\n&gt; Most and probably all of the distinctive infectious diseases of civilization transferred to human populations from animal herds. Contacts were closest with the domesticated species, so it is not surprising to find that many of our common infectious diseases have recognizable affinities with one or another disease afflicting domesticated animals. (McNeill p. 45)\n\nTogether, domestication and agriculture combined to increase human population size and density. As he states in subsequent writings, the jump of pathogens to humans\n\n&gt; depended on the two separate roles of domestication: in creating much denser human populations, and in permitting much more frequent transmission of animal diseases from our domesticates than from hunted wild animals. [(Diamond 2002)](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v418/n6898/full/nature01019.html)\n\nThe difference in number of domesticated herd animals between the Old and New Worlds translates to different loads of infectious agents in human hosts, and the eventual success of the Old conquering the New aided, in part, by a pool of nasty pathogens. \n\nIn this chapter Diamond is not so much guilty of bad history sins of commission as bad history sins of omission. He tackles a highly complex issue, the origin and evolution of human pathogens, but only presents one general hypothesis out of many to support his position. By ignoring the diverse available data and uncritically examining his own position, he presents domestic origins as the only viable explanation for the emergence, and persistence, of human pathogens. Unfortunately, adequate research shows domestic origins is not the best explanation for the emergence of human pathogens in the past and in the present. \n\nBut, anthro_nerd, Diamond wrote *GG&amp;S* in 1997, surely the book represents the best evidence available at the time? Sorry, even in 1997 the blanket application of domestic origins was wrong. The decade and a half since the publication of *GG&amp;S* has not been kind to the theory. Through an examination of the phylogenetic data for modern human infectious organisms, as well as the growing pool of information on modern emerging infectious diseases, a richer story of human disease origins unfolds. Many of the diseases Diamond attributes to crowds emerged earlier than agriculture, and rather than domestication alone, anthropogenic modification of the environment in the past, and modern interaction with wildlife, appear to drive known zoonotic events. The truth is more complex than Diamond’s account and much more fascinating than one generalized explanation. \n\n**Diamond’s Domestication Creates Disease Exemplars**\n\nDiamond establishes a class of infectious agents (“crowd diseases”) without explicitly stating the definition of the term (that is annoying). From context we gather “crowd diseases” mean pathogens like measles, that (1) spread quickly and efficiently, (2) are acute illnesses, (3) survival confers resistance, and (4) tend to be limited to humans. Per his thesis, these pathogens could only have arisen after the development of large, sedentary populations, and represent pathogens that jumped to humans from their domesticated animals ~10,000 years ago. Table 11.1 indicates the deadly gifts include measles, tuberculosis, smallpox, influenza, pertussis and Falciparum malaria. Since these are Diamond’s hand-picked stars let’s dive into the natural history of each of those pathogens.\n\n*Influenza*\n\nCards out on the table, I am the least familiar with the evolutionary history of influenza. While a wealth of genetic information exists on the emergence and spread of recent epidemics/pandemics (1918 pandemic, H1N1, etc.) I am having a devil of a time finding sources on the deeper history of the *Orthomyxoviridae* family. Influenzavirus A, the genus responsible for most modern human epidemics and pandemics, appears to be a promiscuous little sucker who equally infects a wide variety of mammals, as well as birds, so I don’t know if we can confidently arrive at divergence dates like the other obligate human pathogens on Diamond’s list. In the modern context the virus circulates through pigs, birds, and humans in an epidemic fashion. In the absence of good historical data I will give Diamond the benefit of the doubt and say influenza perfectly matches his thesis.\n\nI promise this isn’t some grand plan to avoid evidence that supports Diamond, I’m just stumped. Please share sources if you have them.\n\n*Measles*\n\nMeasles is a member of the genus *Morbillivirus*. Other members of the genus infect mammals ranging from deer to dolphins. Diamond indicates measles emerged from rinderpest, a virus that primarily infected cattle, buffalo, antelopes, giraffes, wildebeests, and warthogs. The first description of a measles-like illness comes from Abu Becr in the 9th century, and [recent phylogenetic analyses](http://www.virologyj.com/content/7/1/52) indicate the divergence of rinderpest and measles (when measles became an exclusively human virus) dates to the 11th and 12th centuries, around the time the first epidemics of the disease appear in the written record. \n\nGiven the best genetic data, we can’t be sure the virus jumped to humans from domesticated cattle, or from one of the many wild hosts. Diamond assumes we gained measles from cattle. I will discuss this in more detail shortly, but in the modern context the majority of zoonotic events occur between humans and a wildlife host. As much as we would like to blame measles on cows, we must entertain the possibility of a wildlife rinderpest source for the jump of measles to humans, as well as wildlife possibly sparking devastating rinderpest epidemics throughout history. The date for the origin of measles is also a little off. If we acquired measles purely from exposure to cattle with rinderpest we expect the jump to occur early on in the history of domestication. Diamond’s thesis would place the zoonosis earlier, near the beginnings of cattle domestication 10,500 years ago. However, the virus emerged 9,500 years later. An order of magnitude error is close enough, right?\n\n*Tuberculosis*\n\nTuberculosis is caused by a bacterium in the *Mycobacterium* genus. The disease has been found in Egyptian mummies from 3000 BC, human remains from 9,000 years ago, and was described by Hippocrates. TB exists as either a chronic, latent infection where the host displays almost no symptoms, or become an active infection with a ~50% case fatality rate. Five closely related species that infect both humans and non-human animals make up the *M. tuberculosis* complex. Diamond indicates human TB arose from cattle, who, along with multiple other animals (deer, llamas, pigs, cats, coyotes, rodents, etc.) can be sickened by *M. bovis*. Per the domestic origins hypothesis *M. tuberculosis* arose from *M. bovis* around the time of cattle domestication, ~10,500 years ago. \n\nGenetic analysis indicates our TB bacterium emerged from a clonal expansion following an evolutionary bottleneck 35,000 years ago ([Gutierrez et al 2005](http://www.plospathogens.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.ppat.0010005)) and is distinct from the more derived *M. bovis*. “There is no clear support for the assertion that the human pathogen originated in the bovine bacterium” (Pearce-Duvet 2006). We didn’t receive TB from the cattle version of the disease. On a deeper level, the progenitor of our TB bacterium diverged from other members of the genus 2.6-2.8 million years ago, indicating our hominin ancestors were likely infected with the disease in East Africa. The clonal expansion of TB 35,000 years ago may coincide with migrations out of East Africa as humans carried the bacteria on their journey around the world. To add some flavor to the debate, recent studies threw a bit of a monkey wrench in our understanding of TB evolution. *M. tuberculosis* was isolated from a 17,000 year old North American Pleistocene bison ([Rothschild et al 2001](http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/33/3/305.short)). The date is slightly earlier than expected for humans to arrive in Wyoming and infect the local wildlife with TB. Given the early New World *M. tuberculosis*, we must entertain the idea that TB originated from zoonotic events from wild bovines to humans in geographically diverse areas, possibly emerging several times in several locations ([Lee et al 2012](http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0041923#pone-0041923-g005)). Regardless, TB was part of the human disease load well before the development of agriculture, and did not exclusively jump to humans from *M. bovis* after cattle domestication.\n\n*Smallpox*\n\nThe first possible evidence of smallpox-like disease appear in Chinese and Indian medical writings in 1122 BC and 1500 BC, respectively. The earliest unmistakable descriptions of smallpox appear in 4th century China, 7th century India and the Mediterranean, and 10th century southwestern Asia ([Li et al 2007](http://www.pnas.org/content/104/40/15787.full)). Diamond indicates smallpox diverged from cowpox or from “livestock with related pox viruses”. The genus that includes smallpox, *Orthopoxvirus*, also contains rabbitpox, buffalopox, monkeypox, swinepox, and cowpox. We commonly think of cowpox as a cattle virus, but the virus is endemic in rodents, who spread cowpox to cows. To state complexity very briefly, the phylogenetic history of the *Orthopoxvirus* genus is messy. The closest relative of smallpox is actually camelpox, but the deeper history of smallpox is linked to a terrestrial rodent native to West Africa. Smallpox diverged from this rodentpox sometime between 16,000 and 68,000 years ago. There are two possible scenarios for the jump of smallpox to humans: (1) smallpox diverged from camelpox, and camelpox itself diverged earlier from a rodent host, or (2) camelpox and smallpox emerged independently from the same ancestral rodent-borne pathogen similar to cowpox ([Pearce-Duvet 2006](http://nfs.unipv.it/nfs/minf/dispense/patgen/lectures/files/readings/pearce-duvet_2006.pdf)). \n\nAgain, smallpox presents a more complex picture than pure domestic origins. We either received smallpox from camels, via a rodent, or we and camels can both blame that stupid rodent for independently making us all smallpoxy. Either way, the timing is interesting because the dates for the diversion precede sedentary agricultural populations, as well as the origin of camel domestication. Diamond would have us believe smallpox emerged with the domestication (of cattle, not camels), and after sedentary agricultural populations produced a pool of hosts large enough to circulate the virus. The truth looks more complex, and rather more fun.\n\n*Pertussis*\n\nDiamond’s table of domestic death indicates we acquired pertussis either from pigs or dogs. Pertussis (AKA whooping cough) is an acute infection caused by a bacteria in the genus *Bordetella*. *B. pertussis* and *B. parapertussis* infect only humans, and are most closely related to *B. bronchiseptica*. *B. bronchiseptica* causes asymptomatic respiratory infections in a variety of mammals, and can occasionally infect immunocompromised human hosts after zoonotic transmission. The history of the genus is relatively complex, but evidence suggests *B. bronchiseptica* diverged from the lineage that would become human pertussis 0.27 to 1.4 million years ago ([Diavatopoulos et al 2005](http://www.plospathogens.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.ppat.0010045)). The rather large confidence interval aside, this timing obviously predates agriculture, sedentary populations, and the domestication of pigs or dogs. (Notice a trend yet?)\n\n*Falciparum malaria* \n\n**ERRATUM** My original analysis of Falciparum malaria was wrong due to a misreading of Lui et al. My mistake. Special thanks to /u/zmil for explaining it to me in a constructive and helpful manner. I will quote his reply, for visibility and to clear up any confusion. \n\n&gt; \"This indicates that human P. falciparum is of gorilla origin, and not of chimpanzee, bonobo or ancient human origin, and that all known human strains may have resulted from a single cross-species transmission event. What is still unclear is when gorilla P. falciparum entered the human population...\"\n\n&gt; So, we don't know precisely when modern humans picked up P. falciparum, but we do know it wasn't present in our hominin ancestors, 'cause we got it from gorillas, not our ancestors. And, judging from the lack of sequence diversity, I'd guess it was a fairly recent jump. Of course Diamond's chicken idea is all washed-up, but malaria is quite clearly of zoonotic origin. \n\nIn the interest of transparency, here is my original, and wrong, malaria analysis.\n\nDiamond indicates Falciparum malaria jumped to our species from birds and parenthetically guesses chickens and ducks are to blame for our malaria problem. In humans four different pathogens in the genus *Plasmodium* cause malaria (*P. ovale*, *P. malariae*, *P. vivax*, and *P. falciparum*) with the *Anopheles* mosquito acting as a vector. *P. falciparum* is by far the most deadly and is presumed to exert extensive selection pressure on humans. The inclusion of malaria in Diamond’s chart of domestication-linked diseases is somewhat strange since the parasite is the only vector-borne pathogen listed, and malaria doesn’t really abide by his definition of a crowd disease. We’ll just go with it because it must support his theory, right?\n\nThere is a great deal of current debate, but the closest relatives of *P. falciparum* are either *P. reichenowi* whose host is a chimpanzee, or other *Plasmodium* species infecting the African great apes. Together, *P. falciparum* and *P. reichenowi* are distantly related to avian forms of malaria, with the divergence of human and chimpanzee/bonobo/gorilla *Plasmodium* arising more than 5 million years ago (Pearce-Duvet 2006). This divergence coincides roughly with the split between our hominin ancestors and the chimpanzee/bonobo lineage. More recent studies indicate a West African gorilla host might be the closest relative of our human *P. falciparum* parasite, so while the jury is still out, we can state malaria is older than our species, and was likely inherited as we diverged from the last common ancestor of the African great apes ([Liu et al 2010](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v467/n7314/full/nature09442.html)). Obviously, this predates agriculture, indicates our hominin ancestors were subject to malaria for millions of years, and frees chickens and ducks of culpability in the domestic origins blame game.\n\nTo add a slight wrinkle in the malaria story, though, 10,000-6,000 years ago *P. falciparum* underwent a selective sweep of one clonal type, possibly giving rise to a more pathogenic form of malaria than our ancestors ever encountered. This demographic sweep corresponds to anthropogenic changes to the environment rather than pure domestication. Humans, by choosing to live in large sedentary populations who alter their surrounding water systems to allow for the growth of crops, changed the game for the *Anopheles* vector. The mosquito could now dine almost exclusively on humans. In most parts of the world mosquitoes feed on non-human animals 80-90% of the time. In sub-Saharan Africa the opposite is true, and a mosquito would prefer to dine on humans 80-90% of the time ([Carter et al 2002]( http://cmr.asm.org/content/15/4/564.full)). With assured transmission thanks to a steady human blood supply for *Anopheles*, the constraints on a highly pathogenic form of *P. falciparum* were released. The parasite could develop its modern, deadly form. Elements of Diamond’s thesis run true for malaria, but the truth is more convoluted, and frankly more interesting, than a blanket domestic origins theory.\n\nSo, after focusing on Diamond’s Fantasy Draft team for the domestic origins hypothesis, what did we learn? With the exception of influenza (again, giving him the benefit of the doubt until I learn more) and measles, all the infectious organisms Diamond picked were part of the human disease load before the origin of agriculture, domestication, and sedentary population centers. Even with measles we can’t exclude the possibility the disease originated from a wildlife source given rinderpest’s ability to infect a wide variety of hosts. To be very, very generous, one element of the theory, namely a large pool of susceptible human hosts, could have influenced pathogen evolution after the development of sedentary agriculture-based population centers, but that is the one pillar left standing after demolishing the house of cards.\n\n**Lessons from Modern Zoonotic Diseases**\n\n&gt; The main reason for the failure of lethal crowd epidemics to arise in the Americas becomes clear when we pause to ask a simple question. From what microbes could they conceivably have evolved? We’ve seen crowd diseases evolved out of disease of Eurasian herd animals that became domesticated. Whereas many such animals existed in Eurasia, only five animals of any sort became domesticated in the Americas… (*GG&amp;S*)\n\nWell, since we’ve effectively cleared the bulk of Eurasian domesticated animals from the blame for making us sick, we’ll turn to his question about zoonoses: “from what microbes could they conceivably have evolved?” Thanks to increased global surveillance, combined with the previously discussed genetic evidence, we know the highest probability is wildlife.\n\n[Jones et al 2008](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v451/n7181/full/nature06536.html) examined trends in the 335 infectious diseases that emerged in human populations between 1940 and 2004. These emerging infectious diseases (EID) were defined as newly evolved strains of a pathogen (like multi-drug-resistant TB), pathogens that entered the human population for the first time (HIV-1, SARS) and pathogens likely present in humans historically, but recently increased in incidence (Lyme disease). 60.3% of EID originated by zoonosis, the transfer of pathogens to humans from a non-human animal host. Of that 60.3% the majority, 71.8%, originated from a wildlife source. Wildlife host species richness was a significant predictor for the emergence of EIDs with a wildlife origin, meaning the more biologically diverse an area the more likely a pathogen jump will take place.  \n\nWhat does this mean for disease origins? Despite all the love we give to domesticated animals, we are far more likely to receive a pathogen gift from the wildlife species we interact with at a high rate and intensity of contact ([Parrish et al 2008](http://mmbr.asm.org/content/72/3/457.full)), specifically those as hunted meat resources ([Wolfe et al 2005](http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/11/12/04-0789_article)), rather than our fuzzy domesticated friends. The EID evidence significantly weakens a fundamental pillar of Diamond’s domestic origins thesis. When we combine the EID data with the natural history of the worst pathogens in human history the role of wildlife takes precedence for the emergence of novel infectious diseases. Contrary to Diamond’s thesis, the relative absence of domesticated meat resources (increasing the need to hunt wildlife) and high wildlife biodiversity in the New World may actually have increased the rate of zoonotic transfers in the Americas when compared to the Old World.\n\n**Lethal Epidemics in the New World and a One-Sided Exchange**\n\n&gt; While over a dozen major infectious diseases of Old World origins became established in the New World, perhaps not a single major killer reached Europe from the Americas… One possible contributing factor is that the rise of dense human populations began somewhat later in the New World than in the Old World. Another is the three most densely populated American centers- the Andes, Mesoamerica, and the Mississippi Valley- never became connected by regular fast trade into one huge breeding ground for microbes… Those factors still don’t explain, though, why the New World apparently ended up with no lethal crowd epidemics at all. (*GG&amp;S*)\n\nExtending the question slightly, why was disease transfer at contact so one-sided? \n\nThere is no easy answer, and I won’t pull a Diamond by applying a simple answer to a complex question. \n\nIn part we have already answered a few elements of the issue. Our species evolved in the Old World, with the largest period of time spent in Africa. Several of the pathogens we discussed emerged in our African ancestors, and, due to a variety of host, migration, and environmental/vector reasons, failed to migrate with us on our journey around the world. I would likewise agree with Diamond’s assertion that a longer time period of dense settlements and long distance trade would enable a pathogen, once established in human hosts, to constantly circulate more readily in the Old World compared to the Americas.\n\nHowever, one huge factor influences the perception of the difference in infectious disease load between the Old and New World: our ignorance. In the New World we have few written or ethnohistoric sources with evidence of infectious disease mortality (aside from [Northern Plains Winter Counts](http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/483371?uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21104549983113)). We are limited to evidence from human remains, written contact-period accounts, and inferences from modern emerging infectious diseases. Coprolites preserve evidence of multiple species of parasite infections throughout the Americas, we can extract TB aDNA from mummified remains, and long-term infections influencing bone leave identifiable markers on the human skeleton. Unfortunately, besides TB and syphilis, these methods haven’t yet identified multiple crowed disease-like pathogens in the New World before contact. Contact period accounts, however, do provide some interesting evidence of epidemic disease in the Americas. \n\nHistorically, scholars assumed all epidemics mentioned in contact-era originated from introduced Old World pathogens. Recently, we see a trend towards re-evaluating this assumption and examining the possibility that colonists observed New World epidemics in action. Diamond kind of lies when he states “the New World apparently ended up with no lethal crowd epidemics at all.” We already mentioned TB, along with decent evidence to suggest the pathogen was present in the New World. One of the deadliest epidemics to strike Mexico was a disease called cocoliztli that killed 7 to 17 million people, both Amerindians and Spaniards, in the highlands of Mexico in 1545 and 1576 ([Acuno-Soto 2002](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2730237/)). By way of comparison, the 1519-1520 smallpox epidemic often blamed for the downfall of the Aztec Empire killed between 5 and 8 million people. Cocoliztli is believed to be a viral hemorrhagic fever related to the modern Hantavirus native to the New World. All available evidence suggests cocoliztli originated in Mexico, and emerged as a wide-spread epidemic after the repercussions of contact (famine, warfare, displacement, social upheaval, etc.) weakened human host immunity and a massive drought changed the interaction of humans with the natural murine host. We don’t know if cocoliztli previously jumped to humans, or if the 16th century epidemics were the first, but they certainly weren’t the last. Waves of cocoliztli continued to flare up with deadly consequences throughout Mexico over the next few hundred years. Three diseases do not prove anything, but combined together TB, syphilis, and cocoliztli do call into question the assumption of a crowd disease-free New World.\n\nWhy did few New World pathogens, save possibly syphilis, become epidemics in Europe? Again, there are no easy answers, and the most intellectually honest response is “We don’t know.” European colonists in the New World died at alarming rates from violence, hunger, and disease. We cannot attribute every episode of disease to a specific New or Old World organism, and given evidence of European to Native American disease transfers, there is sufficient reason to suspect Amerindian pathogens infected Europeans. Why so few Amerindian pathogens arrived in Europe is intriguing. I leave the subject up to debate. Sorry.\n\n**Virgin Soils and Epidemic Disease**\n\n&gt; For the New World as a whole, the Indian population decline in the century or two following Columbus’s arrival is estimated to have been as large as 93 percent… The main killers were Old World germs for which Indians had never been exposed, and against which they therefore had neither immune nor genetic resistance… Cumulative mortalities of these previously unexposed peoples from Eurasian germs ranged from 50 percent to 100 percent. For instance, the Indian population of Hispaniola declined from around 8 million, when Columbus arrived in A.D. 1492, to zero by 1535. (*GG&amp;S*)\n\nI addressed many elements of this bad history in [a previous rant](http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2bqvto/slavery_smallpox_and_virgins_the_us_southeast_as/), and I’m starting to run long here. To summarize that post and subsequent comments, a multitude of factors influenced Native American population decline after contact. Epidemic disease mortality from introduced Old World infections contributed to population loss, striking hardest in Central Mexico, but other impacts of colonialism (slave raids, warfare, territory displacement, social upheaval, famine, etc.) all worked together to decrease host immune defense and spread disease over time and throughout the Americas. The oft-quoted 95% mortality figure reflects estimates of total losses from all causes of mortality, not just disease, and only in certain locations in the Americas at certain times. Where the shockwaves of contact hit in quick succession, like Hispaniola, populations were not able to rebound. When decades or generations passed between high-mortality events, Amerindian populations recovered some of their losses, persisted, adapted, and survived. The generalized explanation for universal early 16th century mortality due to disease throughout the Americas no longer holds. \n\n**Conclusions**\n\nFor a biologist Diamond did a piss-poor job of critically examining the evolutionary history of humans and their pathogens. The majority of his key disease examples failed to support his theory, and he ignored the wealth of data suggesting the vital role of zoonosis in the emergence of human infectious diseases. Indeed, only one pillar of domestic origins, the concentration of susceptible hosts in a high density area allowing for a constant circulation of disease once it jumps to humans, was supported by the genetic evidence. When he applies disease evolution to recent history the conclusions continue to reflect poor critical evaluation of the information, and unfortunately support a rather Eurocentric view of the world. \n\nDiamond’s devotion to generalized explanations, and refusal to discuss debate when we lack concrete answers is the one aspect of *GG&amp;S* that enrages me most. I don’t know if his denial of complexity stems from underestimating the intelligence of his readers, or if the desire to be proven correct led him to ignore all evidence against his thesis. Diamond is an engaging writer, so I don’t doubt his ability to discuss complex issues, but in *GG&amp;S* he meticulously constructed an elaborate house of cards, the pillars of which fold under the slightest breeze. Writing demands time and energy, and wear on your sanity. Why go through all the pain and suffering to write a bad book when you are skilled enough to write a good one?",

        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2cf14t/bad_history_about_the_vietnam_conflict_with_a/",
        "text": "While the bad history surrounding World War I and the myths of generals doing literally nothing but human wave attacks for 4 years until the Americans rolled in has been meticulously and repeatedly debunked here, the bad history about the Vietnam Conflict often takes a far greater hold here on reddit and in popular memory.\n\n[Let the bad history comparisons begin](http://np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/2cde8w/til_that_alice_walton_heir_to_the_walmart_fortune/cjekysw)\n\nSetting aside the basic misunderstanding that the Vietnam Conflict was a conventional war where the US's goal was a territorial victory or that it ended in a conventional defeat, there's been a lot of mythmaking about Võ Nguyên Giáp including very spurious claims that he was one of the best generals of the 20th Century or that his strategies were more crucial to the US withdrawal than American public opinion, especially about the draft.\n\nThere's some serious flaws here specifically as well:\n\n1. Giap was the leader of the NVA/PAVN or conventional forces of North Vietnam, not the Viet Cong and often did not support the latter guerilla group's policies.  In fact, he was not even in country during the Tet Offensive and staged an offensive on Khe Sanh separately.  (I may have been incorrect in opining that the VC offensive was used as a feint by Giap to attack Khe Sanh, although Westmoreland believed this was the case at the time.)\n\n2. There is little proof that Giap was worried about the Phoenix Program centering on the VC/NLF or saw it as an extraordinarily unique undertaking, especially given the VC's own tactics of targeting officers and South Vietnamese leaders.  US airstrikes were far more thoroughly devastating of his own trained conventional forces. Dealing with guerilla warfare was not incredibly new in 20th Century warfare or even for US forces especially given the very bloody counterinsurgency scope of the Philippine-American War.  \n\n3. The gap between NVA forces and US forces is very complex but in part due to considerable Soviet military aid and training, it was often not as staggering as the gap between the US and other opposing forces in previous wars or military operations since.  Tactics for downing US air cover were used throughout the war and Hanoi even maintained an air force with pilots that had multiple kills.  While the US had a leading technological edge (and logistical edge not counting cost), the NVA and VC both made extensive use of modern military technology often including stolen caches of US weapons supplied to South Vietnamese military or civilian militia forces.\n\n4. Numbers **absolutely** were a factor as both Giap and the Vietcong were willing to suffer an extraordinarily high amount of military and civilian casualties to compel a US withdrawal or a negotiated settlement.  Casualties were at a 4:1 ratio (not including South Vietnamese casualties) and the ratio of deaths were likely a few times that multiple.  This included enduring the dropping of more bombs (often directly on North Vietnamese targets including civilians) than by the US in World War II.\n\n5. The diplomatic aspect of this conflict is often overlooked.  After the initial partition of Vietnam, moderates in Hanoi including Giap (although his stance would change over time) wanted a peaceful or at least de-escalated attempt at slowly absorbing South Vietnam.  4 years after the Tonkin Gulf Resolution escalated US involvement, serious peace talks were held in Paris about some kind of deal.  These talks were not productive and did not result in an agreement until 1972 but it's worth mentioning that there is now proof that [Richard Nixon sabotaged the peace talks until he could be elected](http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-21768668).\n\nAs a bonus, there's a good deal of circle jerking about how American civilians or gun culture would handle a fight with the US Army forgetting that it's actually happened several times in US history and been forgotten.\n\n* There's the 1877 Railroad strike (not 1876, sorry) involving thousands of striking railroad workers and civilians commandeering the railroad system across half a dozen states.  About 100 people died during a month of violence between strikers, strikebreakers, and militia before federal troops put down the strike in force.\n\n* Then there's the Battle of Blair Mountain where 10,000 miners trying to unionize waged a massive gun battle with law enforcement, private security and (likely unarmed) non-union miners.  Over a million rounds of ammunition were spent and nearly a thousand miners indicted after the US military intervention.\n\n* Finally, during the LA Riots of 1992, outrage over the Rodney King beating~~s~~ as well as long-term issues with poverty triggered a week of looting, rioting, and violent attacks between civilians and on the police.  Over 13,000 troops including 2,000 from the 7th Infantry Division and 1,500 Marines from the 1st Infantry Division were deployed although they played a smaller role in directly putting down unrest compared to the other 2 examples.\n\nI tried to make a point not to take a side in the examples or evaluate the use of force, but I do think people forget too quickly the history of the use of federal troops within the US and use that ignorance as part of some conjecture about a hypothetical uprising against the federal government.\n\n\nPlease feel free to discuss and critique about both points of bad history.  I know I've glossed over some complexities, especially as hostilities stretched across three decades in Vietnam but it's always bothered me how much amnesia exists about a part of US history that we have incredibly ample documentation on to say nothing of the large amount of Americans who personally experienced the history as well as harrowing combat.",

        "text": "[Oh boy, oh boy!](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2c9eby/what_are_some_great_quotes_by_terrible_people/cjdhyoe)\n\n**First comment:**\n\n&gt;So that begs the question: Did the Allies write the history of the Second World War in a completely honest way?\n\n**My explanation:**\n\n&gt;Far more honestly than had the outcome been opposite.\n\n**Second comment:**\n\n&gt;Just to play the devil's advocate, how do we know that? Who's to say that we demonized them so much that all our actions were justified.\n\n&gt;I'm just gonna point out before a shitstorm starts that what I said does not reflect my actual views. We have a ton of evidence that proves the nazis were fucked up.\n\n**My explanation:**\n\n&gt;Well, one side (the Axis) consisted of three fascistic, totalitarian regimes with major restrictions on human rights as well as complete coöption of the press and little to no transparency, and which had engaged in clandestine mass murder campaigns (with intent to kill tens of millions more in the German example)...while four of the five largest Allied powers were democracies with extensions of rights to both individuals and press, had set limits for the release of classified information for public viewing, and had not been involved in any recent genocidal campaigns.\n\n&gt;I should also point out that the Allies consistent of ideological enemies (USSR with pretty much everyone else), each side making clear that the others were involved in obscene actions during the war.\n\n&gt;In sum, you're playing devil's advocate is this example is ridiculous.\n\n**Third comment:**\n\n&gt;Yea I agree that National Socialism had some insane and destructive views, but 99.9% of people I have met have no idea that the US started an economic war with Japan that effectively forced them to expand forcefully into sovereign territories. They do not know that that the Allies firebombed indiscriminately urban areas throughout Germany and Japan, resulting in hundreds of thousands of civilian deaths. They are not aware of facts such as these because it is ignored in the vast majority of public education curriculums as well as popular educational programming. So yes, we can definitely say that the victors have left out certain unfortunate facts - effectively writing history in their own image.\n\n**My explanation:**\n\n&gt;&gt;Yea I agree that National Socialism had some insane and destructive views\n\n&gt;To say the least.\n\n&gt;&gt;99.9% of people I have met have no idea that the US started an economic war with Japan that effectively forced them to expand forcefully into sovereign territories.\n\n&gt;What? I've studied a lot of history in my day, and I've never heard it argued that the U.S. sanctions placed on Japan are what prompted their imperialist ambitions. A few things here:\n\n&gt; 1. What the fuck is economic warfare?\n&gt; \n&gt; 2. U.S. sanctions placed on Japan were of a passive nature, in that they were merely a prohibition placed on U.S. companies to trade with Japanese businesses or the Japanese government, as such trading ran counter to U.S. interests in its foreign policy. This, an embargo, is distinct from a blockade. The former is most *certainly not an act of war*, while the latter most certainly is. No blockade was ever placed on Japan prior to Japanese declaration of war on the U.S. following Japan's surprise attack on Pearl Harbor.\n&gt; \n&gt; 3. Sanctions were placed on Japan only following the onset of Japanese imperialism, which emerged as a plan to extend Japanese 'divine right' to rule a unified East Asia under the Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere. This was born of Japanese politics, independently of any direction from U.S. foreign policy. Moreover, U.S. sanctions began gradually in 1938, whereas Japan had already been in Manchuria for five years at this point, at the condemnation of the League of Nations as well, and had ramped up its aggression just prior. (You might recall the 1937 Nanking Massacre.) The 1940 Export Control Act, which can be said to be the first serious restriction on trade with Japan, only came following their outright refusal to end their brutality in Manchuria, and did not deter them from signing the Tripartite Pact with Germany and Italy, forming the Axis powers that were unilaterally the aggressors in WWII. It's absolutely delusional to think otherwise. Of course, these sanctions, which would've been outright lifted had they stopped consuming sovereign territories or others' imperial holdings in SE Asia, moreover did not deter them from moving into Indochina, resulting in the U.S. introducing further trade restrictions (embargo on scrap metal, which was crucial for the Japanese war machine given how heavily it relied on the U.S. for it, and the closing of the Panama Canal to Japanese vessels). *Even still*, the U.S. continued its negotiations with Japan. But (big fucking surprise), they were again ignored in favor of continued aggression in East Asia and the Pacific. Of course, this did not cripple Japan in any way, it merely forced on them a sense of panic that required they either abandon their agreement with Nazi Germany and Italy, release possessions in mainland China, and end its aggression in the rest of SE Asia and the Pacific—or, ramp up the aggression once more to gain access to these resources while wiping out a fleet held by their biggest rival in the Pacific. (You can probably guess which of these they chose.)\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;They do not know that that the Allies firebombed indiscriminately urban areas throughout Germany and Japan, resulting in hundreds of thousands of civilian deaths.\n&gt; \n&gt; In response to a war started by these powers, and which these powers chose to continue in spite of their getting pummeled. The object was to force surrender, but that requires drastic action when you're dealing with governments as deluded as those of the Axis powers. Obviously people should be more aware of this, as they certainly do add a shade of grey to the war, but to conclude that the Allies were equatable to the Axis in any meaningful way is absurd.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;They are not aware of facts such as these because it is ignored in the vast majority of public education curriculums as well as popular educational programming.\n&gt; \n&gt; Reddit is the only place that I've ever heard anyone claim that they were never exposed to basic historical details like the *existence* of the Allied bombing campaigns or, as another example I've seen, that the French were an enormous, necessary aid to the colonists during the American Revolution. I'm really starting to think that a lot of you simply didn't pay attention in your history classes in high school or give the textbook a quick reading, because I've never come across a student of mine who was unaware of these events prior to my instruction. And in survey courses, believe me, these are not all history buffs.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;So yes, we can definitely say that the victors have left out certain unfortunate facts - effectively writing history in their own image.\n&gt; \n&gt; These facts are immediately available in an enormous quantity of media about the Allies during WWII. Nobody is concealing anything about the firebombings of Dresden or Tokyo. Hell, chances are a good deal of U.S. high school students [didn't even need a *history* course to hear about the former.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slaughterhouse-Five)\n\n**Fourth, less-bad comment:**\n\n&gt;I actually was taught that the U.S. effectively started an economic war with Japan, but my teacher, to quote her, \"didn't like wars, so she didn't focus on them.\" So it isn't surprising that I didn't know about the firebombs. Our educational system is getting SLIGHTLY better at admitting that the U.S has done some fucked up shit. Both Colombus and westward expansion/manifest destiny are almost villified now.\n\n**My explanation:**\n\n&gt;This is problematic, for two reasons:\n\n&gt;1. The world wars are an enormous part of twentieth century history, and to ignore them is to ignore pretty much the defining events of first half of the century, and the foundation of the second half of the same century.\n\n&gt;2. The U.S. did not \"effectively [start] an economic war with Japan.\" The U.S. employed diplomacy to try to end and undo Japan's imperialist pursuits (which were widely known to be exceedingly brutal) to which the Japanese government paid no heed.",

        "text": "Today we return to /r/todayilearned for a wonderful treat: Native American history. Approximately one year ago, a Professor Xavier learned that the Americas were home to a host of cities supporting huge populations. Given the unfortunate state of precolumbian history in American schools, this revelation was sure to be a shocker. But even Nostradamus could not have predicted the poo that would fly within:\n\n[http://np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1fvc34/til_native_americans_had_cities_ranging_in_size/](http://np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1fvc34/til_native_americans_had_cities_ranging_in_size/)\n\n&gt; \"These mounds—not unlike European cathedrals in spiritual or architectural significance\"\nSpiritual significance I can understand. But how exactly are earth mounds as architecturally significant as the Cathedrals they were building in Europe around the same time period?\n\nThere are two issues with this statement. Perhaps most notably, not all Indians^1 constructed primarily with earthworks. Let's use one of the examples from the linked article: the Chaco Canyon society. Beginning in the 9th century A.D., Chacoan society began to develop. By the end of the 11th century, a massive network of [roads](http://www.nps.gov/chcu/historyculture/images/North_Road_at_Pueblo_Alto.jpg) covering thousands of miles connected an area larger than Portugal.^a One ritual center for this society is contained in what is now called Chaco Canyon. For those not familiar with the site, Chaco canyon is 53 square miles of harsh, dry desert. The area is bitingly cold in the winter and blisteringly hot in the summer. Water management is a constant battle and the area is nearly uninhabited as a result even today. Yet in the middle of this extreme environment, the Chacoans constructed at least 14 great houses and nearly 100 smaller residential structures. The greatest of these is called [Pueblo Bonito](http://scotthaefner.com/photos/images/fullsize/kap/chacoCanyon01.jpg), a massive complex of over 600 rooms constructed of stone and mortar rising to over 5 stories in its heyday. [Reconstructed images](http://i.imgur.com/TisKj7F.jpg) can help one understand the sheer scale of this structure. Nearby, the Chetro Ketl great house contains a large raised plaza on a hill. One might be forgiven for assuming this hill was natural, but it isn't. The entire hill on which the site is constructed was deliberately created by the Chacoans simply because they felt like it. \n\nIn fact, Chaco Canyon as a whole is so enormous and sustained such a large population when it was used that the local landscape could not provide the resources. The nearest sites suitable for the agricultural production required are 40 miles away. Tens of thousands of trees were systematically harvested and shipped, sometimes upwards of 60 miles. Millions of stones were used to construct the walls and roads. The trade networks of Chaco canyon stretched from the Pacific to the Atlantic. Cacao and Macaw feathers were traded from Mexico. Buffalo was traded from the plains to the Northeast. Chacoan society challenged almost anything in Europe at the time. Even one of greatest buildings of the period, the [Monreale](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/53/Monreale_BW_2012-10-09_10-23-10.jpg/1024px-Monreale_BW_2012-10-09_10-23-10.jpg), was scarcely taller than Pueblo Bonito.\n\n\nNow we can address the implicit, secondary issue: Earthworks are not inherently inferior to stonework. Monk's mound at Cahokia has a larger footprint than the Great Pyramid of Giza. A large earthwork isn't a matter of simply throwing dirt together, particular at the scales the scales Cahokia was working with. It takes sophisticated knowledge of erosion, dirt, and the ability to orchestrate vast labor pools. Large earthworks are a massive undertaking that are difficult and expensive to construct even today.\n\n&gt; \"*No one believes me when I tell them the majority were killed by diseases from the white man and they had huge cities.*\"\n\n&gt; That's because it's not true. Majority were not killed by disease. Just because some dumb fuck like jared diamond says so doesn't make it true. The great majority indians ( in north america ) were killed in the 1800/1900s - hundreds of years after contact with the \"white man\" and the white man's disease.\n&gt; It's funny how the white man's disease didn't kill off the asians, african, aborigines or white men? It's funny how the white man's disease doesn't kill off the indians that we discover in the amazon. The indians were simply wiped out.\n\nUnfortunately this is completely and utterly wrong. Let's start with the juicy assertion that the old world never had to deal with these diseases.\n\nFirst of all, smallpox had been a plague for thousands of years.^b We know it spread through Egypt around 1145 B.C. because Ramses V contracted it. In 8th century Japan, mortality rates for the smallpox epidemic are estimated at close to 30%. By the 12th century, crusaders brought it back and epidemics ravaged Europe from the 14th century onwards.^c The disease similarly decimated Chinese and Indian urban centers from the 7th Century onwards, although inoculation techniques were reportedly used to help control the disease.^2\n\n*Every* region of the world has had issues with these diseases at some point in history. Oh, and those Indians in the amazon? Mortality rate that exceeded 99% for some tribes.^d *Current* researchers don't infect people with smallpox because smallpox is extinct in the wild. It doesn't exist outside of some very tightly monitored laboratories in the US and Russia. Transmission of other diseases is still considered a major issue for researchers. For those who are interested in an overview of the spread of disease in the new world, [Dobyn's paper](http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/colonial/disease-contact.pdf) is a good survey of the literature.\n\n&gt; \"*In thirty years, about 70% of the Taínos died.*\"\n&gt; Utter bullshit. Smallpox/measles/chickenpox/spanish flue/bubonic plague combined would not reduce a population by 70%. But lets say it was. So what? It would take the remaining 30% a couple of generations for the population to bounce back. What happen to that population?\n\nSure, except for the fact that they were enslaved and later subjugated by the Spanish, their lifestyle destroyed, and their native lands colonized. Except for those very minor things, they probably could have bounced back from a depopulation so severe that it makes post-war Russia's depopulation look like child's play.^3\n\n&gt; Let me put it this way. If the early settlers had given the natives all their disease and then left, there would be hundreds of millions ( at least ) of natives in america.\n\nHundreds of millions is on the high side of even pre-columbian population estimates for *all* of the Americas. Dobyn places the number at 112 million in his 1966 paper,^e which is widely considered a good upper estimate on the true number.\n\n&gt; That's my fucking point moron. There is NO EVIDENCE of the death rate of the natives. Everything is MADE UP ( PURE GUESSES ). We DO NOT KNOW WHAT THE POPULATION WAS. We DO NOT KNOW HOW MANY DIED from what. So every stat is BULLSHIT. Do you know what historians estimate the pre-columbian native population to be? Anywhere from a few million to over 100 million.\n\nThis is badhistory of a different sort. In fact, we can provide approximate pre-columbian estimates for population in many regions of the Americas and we know relatively well how many were left by the time contact was strongly established. After that period, we still have access to even more accurate population accounts. While precise numbers are impossible to come by, our mortality estimates are far from \"PURE GUESSES\".\n\n&gt; \"These mounds, not unlike European cathedrals...\"\n&gt; Uh, yeah. Piles of dirt are EXACTLY like buildings built to stand for hundreds of years. There glass windows and hinged doors are so similar to dirt. Duh, people.\n\n[Illustration of Pueblo Grande](http://www.blm.gov/pgdata/etc/medialib/blm/co/information/newsroom/2011/news_releases_-_photos.Par.56588.Image.-1.-1.1.gif)\n\n[Taos Pueblo](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/95/USA_09669_Taos_Pueblo_Luca_Galuzzi_2007.jpg)\n\n[Oraibi, Tusayan](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-BjOPdotZR2k/UChwVy_x_NI/AAAAAAAAAlI/7iAN5Fwu1eE/s400/Oaribi.jpg)\n\n[Casa Grande](http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/casa-grande/Casa-Grande-6.jpg)\n\n[Not to be confused with Casas Grande](http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/assets/images/notas_2012/mayo_2012/paquime-ciudad-guacamayas.jpg)\n\n[Teotihuacan](http://www.softseattravel.com/sitebuilder/images/Teotihuacan_Pyramid_of_the_Moon-580x210.jpg)\n\n[Cholula](http://www.anthroarcheart.org/grfx/v90f.JPG)\n\n[Ingapirca](http://www.travel-pictures-gallery.com/images/ecuador/ingapirca/ingapirca-0002.jpg)\n\n[Random amazonian village](http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/12/03/article-1091550-02AD71A7000005DC-209_468x351.jpg)\n\n[Another shot of Pueblo Bonito](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-6yAebKreS7g/Ui28QQHIg7I/AAAAAAAAHag/50crYl__IL4/s1600/Pueblo+Bonito+-2.jpg)\n\nEach of those is hundreds of years old and in the case of Taos, is a continuously inhabited structure almost a thousand years old. Oraibi itself has been inhabited almost as long, but its residents have a bad habit of tearing down their houses whenever someone dies or moves. \n\n\n&gt; They had patches of dirt with lots of people and a few structures...not real \"cities\"\n\nTenochtitlan had a population between 70,000 and 300,000.^f Paris, the largest city in Europe at the time, had between 100,000 and 300,000 people. Mesoamerica as a whole may have been the most densely populated region in the world at the time. Cholula, the second largest city in the Aztec Empire and home to perhaps as many as 100,000 people before Cortes, is home to the world's largest pyramid, dwarfing the Egyptian pyramids that so amazed Europeans. In fact, the cities were so large [a map](http://www.delange.org/TemMayor2/Dsc00001m.jpg) was necessary to attach to Hernan Cortes' letters when they were published. Let's not forget [Teotihuacan](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/06/View_from_Pyramide_de_la_luna.jpg) either. I'm not sure about anyone else, but that certainly doesn't much resemble a patch of dirt to me. While the great Mesoamerican cities may not have had the same technologies and social structures as European cities, they could rival anything in Europe in size and \"city-ness\".\n\n&gt; 90% of the native population was killed off by disease carried by blankets.\n\nI am not going to repeat a debunking of this tired myth that everyone seems to believe. [Here's](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/274aql/how_big_of_an_effect_did_the_smallpox_blankets/) the obligatory /r/askhistorians post.\n \n \n \n**Footnotes and Sources**\n\n^1 I will continue to use the word *Indian* to refer to all indigenous peoples of the Americas due to the lack of another appropriate term with enough generality.\n\n^2 As pointed out by [/u/KaliYugaz](http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2c9yeb/they_had_patches_of_dirt_not_real_cities/cjde7dk), the evidence for inoculation techniques in Asia during this time period is flimsy.\n\n^3 To quote Eisenhower: \n&gt; When we flew into Russia, in 1945, I did not see a house standing between the western borders of the country and the area around Moscow. Through this overrun region, Marshal Zhukov told me, so many numbers of women, children and old men had been killed that the Russian Government would never be able to estimate the total.\n\n\n\n^a *Mesa Verde Settlement History and Relocation: Climate Change, Social Networks, and Ancestral Pueblo Migration* \nLinda S.

Here's the problem; it's really hard to find an impartial judge of what really happened to India during the years of ruling under both the British East India Company and during the British Raj. There is a lot of resentment within Indians (just look at those comments), and that has a tendency to create a form of cognitive dissonance on both sides. So let's look at both sides arguments:\n\n**Pro-British Side**\n\n* Built up the economy\n\n* brought \"western civilization\" to India (whatever that means)\n\n* Increase in education/tech advancement in India (I'm looking at +33% beaker output now that I have the \"Oversea Colony\" bonus)\n\n**Pro-India Side**\n\n* They robbed us\n\n* Treated like second-class citizens\n\n* Left the Indian people divided (reason why all problems exist in India today according to /r/india)\n\nAlright, so let's look at the actual history. It's generally agreed that Aurangzeb (r. 1658-1707), the last of the major Mughal emperors (son of the Shah Jahan, the man who had the Taj Mahal built, if you were wondering), began the downward spiral that would end the Mughal Empire. \n\n\n&gt;The Mughal Empire reached its peak around 1700 and for several reasons began to decline just as the British began to increase their presence. First, the majority Hindu population resented new religiously intolerant policies—such as increased taxes on non-Muslims. Second, emperors spent the wealth of the Empire fighting a prolonged military campaign in the South. The Hindu Marathas humiliated the powerful Mughal Empire for decades with unrelenting guerrilla tactics. As a result, the Empire went into debt and demanded more revenue from its nawabs elsewhere. Regional princes and religious groups, such as Hindus and Sikhs, resented Mughal leadership, sensed weakness, and looked for opportunities to break away (Asher 225-230).\n\nAurangzeb's invasion of Southern India proved costly and divisive, but it was his reinstation of the *jizya* tax, which had been removed by his great-grandfather Akbar, that drove many of the Hindu-majority population from the hands of the Muslim-minority government (that Crusader Kings knowledge). \n\nas the 1700s went on, the British East India company gained more power and influence, and began the process of gobbling up land. Following Robert Clive's victory in the Carnatic Wars against the nawab of Bengal, he wrote the following to Prime Minister William Pitt:\n\n&gt;the natives themselves have no attachment whatever to particular princes; and as, under the present government, they have no security for their lives and properties, they would rejoice in so happy an exchange as that of a mild for a despotic government.\n\nIn fact, according to Clive, even the Mughals won't care:\n\n&gt;and there is little room to doubt our easily obtaining the Moghul’s sunnud (or grant) in confirmation thereof, provided we agreed to pay him the stipulated allotment out of the revenue, viz. fifty lacs annually. This has of late years been very ill paid, owing to the distractions in the heart of the Moghul Empire, which have disabled that court from attending to their concerns in the distant provinces\n\nSo the Mughals don't care who rules the land, as long as the person pays tax, but they were really bad at collecting the tax. But not only were they bad at collecting tax...\n\n&gt;In 1739, a Persian king sacked Delhi, the capital of the Empire, killing 20,000 people. The Persians stole the royal jewels, including the Darya-e Noor diamond, one of the oldest and largest diamonds in the world. As of 2012, the Darya-e Noor was still on display in Tehran, Iran; the Persians never returned it. They also took the famous peacock throne (Asher 253). Then the King of Kabul (Afghanistan) attacked Delhi in the 1750s and 1760s (255). After that, the Mughal Empire still claimed sovereignty over large areas but in practice was simply the seat of a small kingdom (247). For the next hundred years, independent successor states acknowledged Mughal rule but paid little or no tribute.\n\nSo they were RINOs (Rulers in name only). But the question is, were the British also robbing the Indians? Well, after the Sepoy Rebellion of 1857, India was under the complete rule of the British rule, and during this time:\n\n&gt; Queen Victoria became the Empress of India and in her Proclamation of 1858 she announced that all Indians would be treated equally under British law regardless of race or religion. Failure of the Raj to live up to her promises would later become fodder for Indian national movements (Peers 75-76). The stark contrast between British wealth and Indian poverty continued. In 1877, the year Queen Victoria lavishly celebrated her title as Empress of India, famine killed approximately 4 million Indians (75). \n\nThe Famine of 1877 was more complicated than that, caused by several different environmental and economic issues, but I feel it's important to note that\n\n&gt; during the famine the viceroy, Lord Lytton, oversaw the export to England of a record 6.4 million hundredweight of wheat.\n\nOuch. That doesn't help. It's like the plot to a really bad sci-fi movie. However, we must venture on, to the eternal point made by all colonial apologists...\n\n&gt;Between 1860 and 1880, miles of railroad tracks increased from 836 miles to almost 10,000 (50).\n\nOkay. The Great Indian Peninsular Railway was a major stepping stone; it helped lead the way for Indian Railways, one of the largest railway companies in the world, and it employs over 1 million people today.  However, what happened to the old railway?\n\n&gt;n 1900 the government took over the GIPR network, while the company continued to manage it. With the arrival of the First World War, the railways were used to transport troops and foodgrains to the port city of Mumbai and Karachi en route to UK, Mesopotamia, East Africa etc. By the end of the First World War, the railways had suffered immensely and were in a poor state.[14] In 1923, both GIPR and EIR were nationalised with the state assuming both ownership and management control.[13]\n\n&gt;The Second World War severely crippled the railways as rolling stock was diverted to the Middle East, and the railway workshops were converted into munitions workshops.[15]\n\nSo it wasn't all peachy keen, but history never is. The rails might have been used for the benefit of all British Indians, but the rails belonged to the British government, and so did the profits. Alright, what about education? Well, prior to the English we have the system in place from the Muslims:\n\n&gt;The education system under the rule of Akbar adopted an inclusive approach with the monarch favoring additional courses: medicine, agriculture, geography, and even from texts from other languages and religions, such as Patanjali's work in Sanskrit.[19] The traditional science in this period was influenced by the ideas of Aristotle, Bhāskara II, Charaka and Ibn Sina.[20]\n\n&gt;The Mughals, in fact, adopted a liberal approach to sciences and as contact with Persia increased the more intolerant Ottoman school of manqul education came to be gradually substituted by the more relaxed maqul school.[21]\n\nSo there was education going on in India, but simply on a small scale. It wasn't like the standards of today, but I'm pretty sure that counts as presentism.  So let's look at the system created by the English:\n\n&gt; Thomas Babington Macaulay introduced English education in India, especially through his famous minute of February 1835. He called an educational system that would create a class of anglicised Indians who would serve as cultural intermediaries between the British and the Indians.[22]\n\n...Different, to massively understate it.  But as time went on, the education system got slightly better...\n\n&gt;India established a dense educational network (very largely for males) with a Western curriculum based on instruction in English. To further advance their careers many ambitious upper class men with money, including Gandhi, Nehru and Muhammad Ali Jinnah went to England, especially to obtain a legal education at the Inns of Court. By 1890 some 60,000 Indians had matriculated, chiefly in the liberal arts or law. About a third entered public administration, and another third became lawyers. The result was a very well educated professional state bureaucracy. By 1887 of 21,000 mid-level civil service appointments, 45% were held by Hindus, 7% by Muslims, 19% by Eurasians (European father and Indian mother), and 29% by Europeans. Of the 1000 top -level positions, almost all were held by Britons, typically with an Oxbridge degree.[30]\n\n&gt;The British rule during the 19th century did not take adequate measures to help develop science and technology in India and instead focused more on arts and humanities.[40] Till 1899 only the University of Bombay offered a separate degree in sciences.[41] In 1899 B.Sc and M.Sc. courses were also supported by the University of Calcutta.[42] By the late 19th century India had lagged behind in science and technology and related education.[40]\n\nAlright, so the education system was lacking, but the 1800s was the first period when complete public education became a major deal, most notably with William Gladstone and Benjamin Disraeli in the 1850s and 1860s. Let's look at the supposed division. \n\nMany people blame the British for the development of the caste system, claiming it was them who used it to keep Indians divided like some kind of power that video game characters have (how else would they only attack you one by one?), but how true is that sentiment? Let's look at where the caste system comes from:\n\n&gt;Manusmriti, dated between 200 BC and 100 AD, contains some laws that codified the professions. The Manu Smriti belongs to a class of books that are geared towards ethics, morals, and social conduct - not spirituality or religion.\n\nBut at the same time:\n\n&gt;In a review published in 1944, D. D. Kosambi noted that \"Almost every statement of a general nature made by anyone about Indian castes may be contradicted.\"[15] The term \"caste\" has no universally accepted definition. To some, it traditionally corresponds to endogamous varnas of the ancient Indian scripts and its meaning corresponds in the sense of estates of feudal Japan or Europe. To others, endogamous jātis — rather than varnas — are castes, such as the 2378 occupation-classified jātis list created by colonial ethnographers in the early 20th century. To others, such as H. H. Risley, it means endogamous groups that resulted from interactions between what were once different races.[16]\n\nHowever it would be that we note the caste system prior to India, we know that the British did come up with thorough definitions of different castes for the censuses, as can be seen [here](https://archive.org/details/censusindia10rislgoog). \n\nAlright, but what about discrimination? \n\n&gt; Between 1860 and 1920, the British segregated Indians by caste, granting administrative jobs and senior appointments only to the upper castes.\n\nSo caste discrimination was a thing, and it continues to this day, even though it was outlawed in 1950, but on a more secretive and small scale than before. However, that's not entirely the British's fault, as \n\n&gt;Dharma encourages the belief that our destiny (caste) is fixed and it cannot be changed. Ward says that the Hindu hyper-good has provided a faithful acceptance of ones worldly fate in order to improve one's lot in the next life cycle. \"Religion provides such rigorous sanctions for social life and impose such a great fear of falling down that people through their patterned daily activity, find it impossible and abhorrent not to follow religious guidelines\" (Ward). Karma is responsible for punishment and reward. This force is influenced by the extent they follow their dharma.\n\nTherefore, it was seen as normal to discriminate by caste because people who are born a certain caste deserve it, due to actions in their past lives. This isn't a metaphysics/philosophy/religion class, but it's plain to see that this sort of logic can be easily abused BY ANYONE, not just the British. In fact, the Dharmic tradition is Indian in origin, so they have no one to blame for the idea but themselves.\n\nFinally, the very thing that brought us to this discussion. The Indian economy/ the \"foriegn looter\" hypothesis (it's what I call the claim that India would be so well off if it weren't for the Brits/Muslims taking everything).\n\n&gt;The Indian economy grew at about 1% per year from 1880 to 1920, and the population also grew at 1%.[1] The result was, on average. no long-term change in income levels. Agriculture was still dominant, with most peasants at the subsistence level. Extensive irrigation systems were built, providing an impetus for growing cash crops for export and for raw materials for Indian industry, especially jute, cotton, sugarcane, coffee and tea.[21]\n\nMeanwhile...\n\n&gt;By 1900, the colony of India had become indispensible to the seemingly boundless imperial and industrial success of the British Empire. India had become the largest market in the world for British goods. By 1913, 60% of all Indian imports came from Britain (James 219). Despite the central position of India in the Empire, all was not well for the Queen’s subjects. Most continued to live in poverty and were vulnerable to diseases and natural disasters. For example, yet another famine in 1900 killed five million Indians and the Raj provided little relief (Copland 18). Even the small but rising Indian middle class resented various forms of institutional discrimination, such as the lower wages they received for equal work. \n\nSo it wasn't that good. But, as many Indian nationalists love to boast, many large Indian companies saw their rise during the Raj, most notably....\n\n&gt; Jamsetji Tata (1839–1904) began his industrial career in 1877 with the Central India Spinning, Weaving, and Manufacturing Company in Bombay. While other Indian mills produced cheap coarse yarn (and later cloth) using local short-staple cotton and cheap machinery imported from Britain, Tata did much better by importing expensive longer-stapled cotton from Egypt and buying more complex ring-spindle machinery from the United States to spin finer yarn that could compete with imports from Britain.[22]\n\n&gt;In the 1890s, Tata launched plans to expand into heavy industry using Indian funding. The Raj did not provide capital, but aware of Britain's declining position against the U.S. and Germany in the steel industry, it wanted steel mills in India so it is did promise to purchase any surplus steel Tata could not otherwise sell.[23] The Tata Iron and Steel Company (TISCO), now headed by his son Dorabji Tata (1859–1932), opened its plant at Jamshedpur in Bihar in 1908. It became the leading iron and steel producer in India, with 120,000 employees in 1945.[24] TISCO became an India's proud symbol of technical skill, managerial competence, entrepreneurial flair, and high pay for industrial workers.[25]\n\nHmm. So, Tata Industries, now one of the largest companies in the world, grew on its own (sort of), but mostly thanks to the ability to trade with the British for the raw materials and the new products (like steel) that they needed. However, that doesn't make the Brits all good, as can be seen during the Bengal Famine of 1770...\n\n&gt;The famine occurred or was made more severe largely due to the British East India Company's policies in Bengal.[7]\nAs a trading body, the first remit of the company was to maximise its profits and with taxation rights, the profits to be obtained from Bengal came from land tax as well as trade tariffs. As lands came under company control, the land tax was typically raised fivefold what it had been – from 10% to up to 50% of the value of the agricultural produce.[6] In the first years of the rule of the British East India Company, the total land tax income was doubled and most of this revenue flowed out of the country.[8] As the famine approached its height in April 1770, the Company announced that the land tax for the following year was to be increased by a further 10%.\n\nThat famine would go on to kill several million people. Hardly a small event, and the lives lost deserve to have their story heard.\n\n\n**In Summary**\n\nThe actions of those in charge during the rule of the BEIC and during the British Raj are not excusable. It is true that a good deal of the structure of the modern Indian education system came from the British, but that is not a sign of their superiority. But at the same time, colonial apologists must remember that the British were willing, time and time again, to overlook the pleas of the Indian people, denying them home rule, allowing their people to die in famines, and generally failing as proper rulers. Although the parliamentary democracy that India has today is heavily based on the British government, this is not a sign of the inability of the Indian people to come up with their own government and a sign of further Western brilliance.\n\nBut on the same token, there were some (albeit few) things that India gained, and people ought to remember that. Simply claiming that the Western world screwed everything up requires overlooking the massive sociological, political, and economic reasons that have brought India to where it is today. It doesn't help anyone when people do that, and it is misguided, short-sighted, and only serves to build resentment between people who should be working together to undo the mistakes of the past. \n\nSources:\n\nEducation: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_education_in_South_Asia\n\nGeneral History: http://webs.bcp.org/sites/vcleary/ModernWorldHistoryTextbook/Imperialism/section_4/earlyindia.html\n\nThe Famines: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Famine_of_1876%E2%80%9378,  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengal_famine_of_1770\n\nWon't Anyone think of the rails? : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Railways, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rail_transport_in_India\n\nCaste system: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caste_system_in_India\n\nEconomic issues: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_India_under_the_British_Raj\n\nThanks for reading, this is the first post I've ever made here on /r/badhistory!

I read them both about a year ago, and I quite enjoyed both. In particular, the description of the economic interactions between China and Europe were fascinating. That being said, I came away from 1491 with the impression that he may have not presented all of the evidence. I came to have this impression because, if the evidence presented in 1491 were the whole story, then a lot of the more conservative population estimates for the New World are patently absurd, and I have a hard time believing that a large swath of academics would hold a belief that seems so very irrational.\n\nSo my question is this: what evidence, if any, was left out of both books, but especially 1491? More broadly, though, did Charles C. Mann do a good job of giving a balanced representation of the fields he discussed?\n\nThis has nothing to with my main question, but how awesome is it that Charles C. Mann toured China with Neal Stephenson? (My copy of Reamde is less than a meter away from me as I type this.)\n\nFinally, my apologies if this is an inappropriate post for this subreddit.

It was no different than people taking land over from animals. If the Europeans didn't do it, another civilization would have. The rest of the world was evolving &amp; growing, while these tribes of primitive Indians stayed the same. There was NOTHING, no country, no nation, no real civilization. If nobody EVER came to this land, then the Indians would still be running around chasing buffalo while the rest of the world is advancing technology, curing diseases, and exploring space. The Indians were basically no different than these tribes in the rainforest that still live the same way to this day.\n\nTo which I replied with these:\n\n&gt;One Google search lets me poke holes in all your arguments.\n\n&gt;The Formative period, beginning at various times between 3,000 - 5,000 years ago, witnessed a flowering of native societies. Archaic period trends became dominant themes during the formative. In some geographical regions, people engaged in full-time agriculture, lived in cities of 10,000+ people, and elevated their leaders both architecturally and socially. For example, at the ancient city of Cahokia, leaders, who may have been considered as living embodiments of gods and goddesses, lived on top of giant earthen mounds which soared several hundreds of feet into the air. In what is now the southwestern U.S., societies who are glossed under the term Anasazi, erected multi-room, mulit-storied apartment complexes, built roads to connect their towns and cities with each other, and engaged in long-distance trading with the might empires of Mesoamerica.\n\n&gt; Source: [Article from Cabrillo College's Website](http://www.cabrillo.edu/~crsmith/anth7_hist1.html)\n\n&gt; Cahokia Mounds State Historic Site /kəˈhoʊkiə/ (11 MS 2) is located on the site of an ancient Native American city (c. 600–1400 CE) situated directly across the Mississippi River from modern St. Louis, Missouri. This historic park lies in southern Illinois between East St. Louis and Collinsville. The park covers 2,200 acres (890 ha), or about 3.5 square miles, and contains about 80 mounds, but the ancient city was actually much larger. In its heyday, Cahokia covered about six square miles and included about 120 human-made earthen mounds in a wide range of sizes, shapes, and functions.\nCahokia was the largest and most influential urban settlement in the Mississippian culture which developed advanced societies across much of what is now the Southeastern United States, beginning more than 500 years before European contact. Cahokia's population at its peak in the 1200s would not be surpassed by any city in the United States until the late 18th century. Today, Cahokia Mounds is considered the largest and most complex archaeological site north of the great Pre-Columbian cities in Mexico.\n\n&gt; Source: [Wikipedia's article on Cahokia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cahokia)\n\n&gt; Medicine was not an unknown science in the Western Hemisphere. Most natural herbs used for medicinal purposes in the modern world had also been used by Native Americans before European contact. Archaeologists have learned that North American Indians made salt by evaporation and mined a great many minerals including copper, lead, and coal.\n\n&gt; Source: [USHistory.org](http://www.ushistory.org/us/1.asp)\n\nGot this sarcasm in reply:\n\n&gt; The lengths you've gone to try and *prove* that the natives in this land were more than they were are commendable. I'd love to believe that if settlers didn't come here and take over, these natives would have evolved past their superstitions and beliefs... or at all.

They enslaved, killed and ate the native peoples!\n&gt;Man... shit was real back in the day. You could just show up at a place and be all \"this is the place for me, you guys fuck off\" and just take their shit. And everyone did it. To everyone else! People are assholes.\n\nThe Maori *did* hire a couple of British ships to crush the Moriori civilization on Chatham Island. There was some serious consideration about whether the Moriori were \"pre-Maori natives\", but it's now thought they are not genetically distinct, but merely a new culture that developed due to their geographical separation. The enslavement and slaughter of 2000 people on an island after European contact is a bit different to the myth that the Maori wiped out a native people who inhabited the mainland islands.\n\n[Here](http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/1966/history-myths-in-new-zealand/page-10) is a better explanation from a history professor in NZ:\n\n&gt;The term Moriori should, in fact, be limited to the inhabitants of the Chatham Islands, people who were largely killed and assimilated by Maori invaders early in the nineteenth century. It should never be employed to identify a very dark-skinned, primitive non-Polynesian (perhaps Melanesian) race of New Zealanders, an inferior people wiped out by the superior, subsequent, and conquering Maoris. All early inhabitants of New Zealand were certainly Polynesian and the likelihood is that Maori culture developed continuously from the time of the first settlers from the Pacific Islands, without sharp breaks, and determined by isolation and by the conditions of the environment.\n\n\n\nNext, here's some more badhistory from the same reddit thread:\n\n&gt;&gt;Guess what: humans wiped them out! Specifically the Maori people of New Zealand, long before Europeans settled.\n\n&gt; But something something white people. Your ruining it!!!\n\nSo [the Maori drove the Moa to extinction!](http://np.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/2c0e28/preserved_megalapteryx_foot/cjayusn?context=1) Alright, this is quite possibly true... but the follow-up comment \"But something something white people. Your ruining it!!!\" is the badhistory. Gee, look at these savage Maori challenging the established narrative that Europeans caused everything wrong in the world!\n\nAnd [some bad science](http://np.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/2c0e28/preserved_megalapteryx_foot/cjaz4wq) to top it off. It's okay, it's not the Maori's fault: *they are genetically predisposed to violence*. This claim has not been [well-received by the academic community](http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10395491):\n\n&gt; It is pretty contentious to be tagging a gene, especially with that type of behaviour, to an ethnic race. There are huge ethical behaviours behind it. I was appalled.\n&gt;It is extremely unlikely that a single gene explains anything. It is almost always a combination of factors, particularly environmental influences\n\nA more scientific article is [here](http://journal.nzma.org.nz/journal/120-1250/2441/). Specifically:\n\n&gt;As alluded to by Merriman and Cameron, the extrapolation and negative twisting of this notion by journalists or politicians to try and explain non-medical antisocial issues like criminality need to be recognised as having no scientific support whatsoever and should be ignored.\n\n\nThis is all pretty awful, because it's really about modern racism. The principle is this: if we can argue that the Maori were savages who are predisposed to violence and were slaughtering people and destroying the environment before the Europeans even got there, then that means it's \"their own fault\" that they are disproportionately in poverty or prison, and that we don't need to feel bad about what Europeans were doing in the past - because they were \"just as bad\" - and hence we don't need to continue to process treaty grievances etc.\n\nTo quote the [same history professor](http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/1966/history-myths-in-new-zealand/page-10):\n\n&gt;And yet, one may be permitted to wonder, is not this “error” strangely related to the myth of the possessors? If the Maoris themselves could be represented as an invading, conquering, expropriating people, would not this story serve to justify the activities of a race of subsequent conquerors, to turn the charge of expropriation upon the victims themselves?\n\n----\n\n**[tl;dr](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-jVAHAuiS4)**\n\n----\n\nEdit: Added more sources.

This is the [original comment]( http://www.np.reddit.com/r/4chan/comments/2butn7/v_on_africans/cj99apa) that actually made me a little bit sad that people still hold this view, and honestly makes me question the level of knowledge people actually have about the realities of post-colonial Africa. To be honest, that entire thread is just a constant stream of racism, stereotypes, Eurocentrism and either unfortunate misunderstandings or deliberate misrepresentations. Some comments might make you cry, others might make you angry, but this one in particular just riled me up.\n\nSo, that being said, let's start at the beginning.\n\n\n&gt;**Despite the awful things the Europeans did they also helped to move Africa and the rest of their colonies forward in history.**\n\nWow. Just wow. What a way to begin an argument about the merits of colonialism in Africa. By beginning that sentence with the acknowledgement of the \"awful things\" that colonialism did to the colonised regions (presumably including the genocides, fundamental disassembly of pre-colonial African social, political and economic structures, the spatial problems created by arbitrary land divisions, a reorientation to western forms of infrastructural development, and the inherent flaws in the process of decolonization), the author seems to think that gives him a get-out-of-jail-free card to then go on and make grand sweeping statements about the condition of post-colonial Africa and the role colonialism played in 'civilising' it. The second part of that sentence, where the author suggests the European imperialism helped move Africa 'forward in history' just doesn't make any sense. How exactly does one 'move forward in history'? I assume, based upon the later comments made by the author (which I will get to in a minute), that what they really mean is the concept of progression towards 'civilisation'. \n\nThere are numerous problems with this view, but most importantly, it requires a teleological and Eurocentric approach to world history where there is only one true type of civilisation or progression; that of Western or European democratic capitalist nation states.  Historians like David Landes or E.L. Jones take this approach to world history, suggesting that by their own geography, economic structures and socio-cultural characteristics, Europe and other Western states were the only ones able to make the leap from a pre-industrial to an industrial society, and other societies unwilling to accept these changes therefore 'fell behind' in the progression race. As Landes argues, China was fundamentally unable and unwilling to adapt to the 'superior' European methods and economic systems and therefore its own stubbornness saw resulted in its own downfall. (I wrote a much longer answer to this theme in an AH post [here]( http://www.np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1pzf28/why_did_european_powers_in_particular_start/cd7n7j1)) The reason I raise this problem is simply because when somebody suggests that European imperialism helped 'advance' the social, economic, and politic features of Africa societies, they are implicitly accepting the view that Europeans were superior and that the 'benefits' they imparted to the poorer, uncivilised African societies were therefore advantageous and beneficial to the colonised regions. This argument necessitates a belief in European civilisation as being what all other societies should aspire to and should be working towards. The people who hold these views are usually also ignorant to or dismissive of the various pre-colonial African societies that flourished and in many ways exceeded and out competed competition from European states (Great Zimbabwe and its extensive trade routes, Ethiopia, Mali, Ghana, etc.)  in their own times, in favour of the idea that Europeans arrived in Africa to a blank slate, an inferior, 'uncivilised' people, and therefore many things that colonialism brought with it, helped to raise the standard of living more towards the acceptability of European civilisation. Thomas M. Callaghy succinctly sums up this view in a fantastically derogatory and dismissive piece of writing: Africa ‘could allow the forces of implosion and ethnic warfare to become masters of its fate...Thus history would repeat itself...and this old continent would be at the mercy of all types of corruption once again.'\n\nThe author of the post puts forward this very view, not quite so succinctly and without realising they are even doing so, when they write:\n\n&gt;**India, for example, had their railroads built by the Europeans. These railroads were built to control the Indians but later served as an integral part of the Indian infrastructure. By the 1940s India had the fourth longest railway in the world. The Europeans thus got the Indians on the track (pardon the pun) to a modern infrastructure and later economy.**\n\nIeuan Griffiths in his book *The African Inheritance* emphasises the problems that any arguments made with this standpoint face, by pointing out that Africa (or any colonised society) is considered passive in this case, subject to ongoing colonial legacies without any pre-colonial or post-colonial factors that help explain the contemporary situation these societies or regions or states find themselves in. There is also the idea that colonialism acted completely upon the subject society, which was obviously not the case. Consider the many, many, many ways in which colonised people have either actively or passively resisted the colonial pressures, ranging from disobedience (absent workers) to outright rebellion (the 1896 Chimurenga), the production of new syncretic forms of culture (African Christianity) or the total rejection of European society (the Niger Ibos). To suggest that colonialism worked from a top-down and complete implementation is to ignore both a hundred years of historical research and the existence of contemporary socio-cultural traits which show otherwise. \n\nBut anyhow, let's move on.\n\n&gt;**The same goes for South Africa. South Africa was at one time producing more than enough food; in fact enough to feed other parts of Africa as well. The issue is the farmers were mostly European using European farming techniques. The native population attacked and killed the European farmers and effectively forced their country back into starvation as a result.**\n\nThis part of the comment is perhaps one of the most widely regurgitated arguments put forward when talking about the post-colonial situation in Southern Africa and is often used as evidence of the benefits colonialism held for the colonised peoples. I believe here that the author has got their histories of South Africa and Zimbabwe muddled, because this argument is put forward 99% of the time when talking about how Mugabe and the 'black man' has screwed up in what was once 'the bread basket of Africa'. I also don't fully understand how South Africa ties into an argument about the merits of colonialism when South Africa had been relatively independent of Britain since the 1909 formation of the Union, but to be fair to the author, I will address the statements as they stand.\n\nThe author's assertion that South Africa was at one time producing more than enough food to feed other parts of the continent is an incredible simplification of a complex system but is not bad history.  /u/khosikulu is a lot more knowledgeable than me on the realities of South African agriculture but I can certainly address this assertion with what I know regarding this part of history. South Africa had an extensive and highly capitalised agricultural element to its economy both during and after the colonial period. It had much higher fertiliser usage than was average within sub-Saharan African societies, and despite only a small portion of land being suitable for arable farming (about 10% total), there was widespread livestock farming that made use of non-arable land - as a result between 78.4% and 82% of South Africa's total land area has been classed as agricultural land since 1961. And herein lies the key point in addressing why the author's statement that South Africa produced enough food to export surplus may be factually correct but is not entirely true; cattle makes up a disproportionate percentage of that production. \n\n\nConsidering South Africa as an independent nation, it has consistently (despite some minor fluctuations) remained a net food exporter, but it is only due to cattle that this is the case. [This document]( http://www.fao.org/docrep/015/i2497e/i2497e00.pdf) shows the state of agriculture in Africa as a whole, but specific data for South Africa show just how close it has come to losing its status as a net importer. However, it also shows that South Africa, in part due to the large capital investments to the economy as a result of the mining operations, has consistently imported large amounts of food, specifically grain crops and other produce which cannot be grown to the required quantities in South Africa's limited arable land. Foreign currency earned by mining profits paid for food requirements which could not be met by a relatively narrow agricultural industry. Neighbouring Rhodesia, for which crop and agriculture records are well documented, presents similar issues. The legacy of colonialism primarily restricted large-scale agriculture to a select range of produce (tobacco and cattle in Rhodesia, for example) which meant importing food was always a necessity - however, if enough of the select agricultural produce could be exported (as was the case in South Africa with beef) then overall South Africa could be identified as a net food exporter. It is also very very important to note that the percentages of food exported differed drastically between the white and the African sectors - only 20-25% of African production was marketed with the remaining  75-80% consumed locally. European agriculture in South Africa saw around 65% marketed, and the remainder used locally, mainly as a means of paying the farm labourers, according to Darcy Du Toit. The author is not wrong, but they are still an asshole, and specifically because what they say next is really, truly, honestly just bad history.\n\n&gt;**The issue is the farmers were mostly European using European farming techniques. The native population attacked and killed the European farmers and effectively forced their country back into starvation as a result**\n\nThis is a heavily bastardised version of the truth and the realities of why there has been agricultural decline in South Africa recently, and is why I believe the author has got South Africa and Zimbabwe mixed up. That being said, I have only minor problems with that first sentence. European farmers in South Africa and in Rhodesia did absolutely make up the most significant proportion of agricultural production, and did use European farming methods (mostly.) In South Africa, and especially after the creation of the homelands into which Africans were forcibly moved, the largest proportion of arable farmland was legally under white control, located outside of the African homelands (around 73%). European farming techniques were certainly used by white settlers in South Africa, including the adoption of fertilisers, stationary agriculture and grazing, and the introduction of irrigation increased the area of land suitable for arable farming. But European techniques were neither wide reaching or cutting edge. In 1947, there was less than one tractor for every six farming units, according to Charles Feinstein in *An Economic History of Africa*, and it was not until the early 1960s that tractors and combine harvesters began to integrate into South African agriculture.\n\n\nBut just because the European farmers owned the lands doesn't mean that they farmed it by themselves. In Rhodesia for example, 38% of the total African labour force was employed by commercial farmers and more than 1.4 million Africans lived on the commercial farms. In South Africa over 2 million Africans were *officially* employed in the agricultural sector in 1970, which meant maybe around 1.6million in reality. That is not to say that an African agricultural industry did not exist either. The figures for Rhodesia are quite astounding. The gross output of white agriculture in Rhodesia increased between 1966 and 1975 from $144.7million to $362million, whilst the gross output of African agriculture rose from $52.1million to $102.2million in the same period - no insignificant figure. (See Trevor Grundy, *The Farmer at War*). In South Africa in 1970, it was estimated that about 814,000 Africans were farming in the reserves,  with the figure engaged in subsistence farming outside of the reserves largely unknown. \n\nThis raises, in itself, another important issue. In the next sentence the author of the post suggests that because the \"Africans attacked and killed the European farmers\", it essentially undid all the hard work of the Europeans in helping the poor Africans out of their backward-ass existence. First of all, I really, honestly, think the author is thinking about Rhodesia here and the protracted and long drawn out civil war which did see white farmers attacked, farms abandoned and agricultural production suffer. However, even then there was not an immediate drop in agricultural production. In 1979, the Rhodesian agricultural sector had diversified enough (from beef, cotton and tobacco primarily, to include maize, wheat, soyabeans, poultry, tea, coffee, citrus and sugar) to be able to export even under international sanctions produce to the value of $500million per annum, exceeding even mining operations for diamond and gold. An admittedly government-funded investigation into the agricultural industry in Rhodesia in 1981 (first year of independence) concluded that 'the country is self-sufficient in producing food.' Obviously, events since the birth of an independent Zimbabwe have proved this is no longer the case, but during the 1980s and 1990s Zimbabwe's agricultural production remained high and fairly steady. It was not until the 2000s when the land seizures began in earnest that farm production began to suffer.\n\nIn South Africa since independence, agriculture has admittedly also shrunk. in 1993 there were just shy of 50,000 agricultural employers, a figure which had declined to 34 000 in 2012. Between 2009 and 2012 the number of farmers shrank by 15 000 in just three years. And the number of people employed in agricultural labour in South Africa has similarly declined from around 700 000 in 1994 to 385 000 in 2012. These two reports [here]( http://www.tips.org.za/files/415.pdf) and [here]( http://web.up.ac.za/sitefiles/file/48/2052/2013%20Working%20Paper%20Series/Statistics%20on%20Farm%20labour%20UP%2017%20Okt%202~28Nov13.pdf) assess this symptom, but to state that South Africa is starving is not synonymous with a decline in agricultural labour or with a persistent attack on white farming. In fact, despite the latest figures showing that 12 million Africans are 'food insecure' (Department of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries, Jan. 2013), that is not because South Africa is not producing enough food. Instead it is a result of a shifting wage labour economy. If something could be blamed for this situation, it is not the African replacement of white farmers. \n\nAnd what is this about \"back into starvation\"? Are they implying that before Europeans arrived all of Africa was starving? I should, at this point, go into a long explanation about the difference in population sizes, the type and nature of pre-colonial subsistence farming amongst the Africans of Southern Africa, etc, etc, but I honestly feel that at this point there is perhaps no point in banging my head against this wall any more. There are many askhistorians posts which address this issues like [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/2bi6qj/what_is_known_about_precolonial_southern_africa/) and pick up any book about pre-col Southern Africa and you may find just a little something refuting this bigoted assumption.\n \n\nAnyhow, I know this may have rambled and got sidetracked a bit, and strayed from history into anthropology or socio-economics, but I just wanted to bring to light the rampant mistakes made in this one comment, and to finish as well with the final bit from this comment. \n\n&gt;**Europeans fucked up a lot of stuff but they also helped a lot as well. Nowadays though if a European nation began colonizing an African country they would be called racists and imperialists for daring to build infrastructure, create jobs, and install a puppet government in place of the dictatorships. The colonies were slowly given up over time due a variety of reasons but they won't be taken back because of the fear of being called racists and imperialists.**\n\nYou always know that when somebody finishes a comment with a statement about not being able to 'take back' the colonies because you would be a racist, there is something a little bit off about their line of reasoning!\n\n\nHope this was okay and would maybe help you refute some of these fairly common bits of bad history that seem to pop up on reddit on a very, very, very regular basis.\n\n\nprofrhodes",

        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2byfzw/just_following_orders_the_myth_of_the_clean_and/",
        "text": "No doubt if you are at all familiar with World War Two and the “fandom” that follows the conflict around, you have no doubt come across the idea that the Wehrmacht was a professional fighting force that fought for the honour and glory of Germany and stayed within the laws of war set out by the Geneva convention; this myth is generally referred to as “Clean Wehrmacht” by its detractors. Its a myth commonly spouted not only by Nazi apologists, but also regular people who only have a casual interest in history. Often times it will be accompanied by statements like \"The Allies committed just as many war crimes\" or \"The victors write the history books\". I figured I'd make this post in hopes of thoroughly debunking the myth(since there really hasn't been a post doing so), but also giving a (hopefully) enjoyable read to anyone interested in the topic. I don't just want to give a list of war crimes, but I also tried to explain not only why they happened, but also debunk the myth that the Wehrmacht was immune to the ideological fanaticism that infested the rest of Germany.\n\n**Origins** \n\nI think its worth taking a look into the origins of the myth. The myth can be traced back to the final years of the war, when desperate Wehrmacht generals and really anyone with a brain began to look for ways to distance themselves from Hitler and the holocaust. While the SS and people like Heinrich Himmler were forced into full blown coverups and engaged in vain attempts to liquidate all the camps to prevent them being found. The Wehrmacht took the “we didn't know” approach and feigned ignorance of the camps and the various orders from Hitler to kill Jews, Communists, and other undesirables. Erich Von Manstein, and Heinz Guderian, both wrote very popular memoirs about the war and in both books the subject of the holocaust and the Wehrmacht's culpability in the various war crimes committed by the Germans are glossed over or outright ignored. Guderian claimed that he never even received the “Commissar order” ( the order to kill all captured Soviet Commissar and other Soviet bureaucrats), despite the fact that we have testimonies from the people who served under Guderian that prove that they were given the order. Franz Halder's memoirs pushed the idea that the war was “Hitler's War”, as in the Wehrmacht was opposed to the idea of war and was pushed into it by Hitler. He also drew a distinction between the “Criminal” SS and the “Clean,Efficient” Wehrmacht. \n\nThe idea that the Wehrmacht was somehow immune or wasn't affected by Nazi propaganda and racial thought is also brought up often. Western Historians and journalists ran with this interpretation of the situation for two reasons: 1) the Wehrmacht's fight in the west, while not clean by any means, was a far cry from the destruction wrought by the Wehrmacht in the East. The crimes the Western allies did face could almost always be attributed to the SS. 2) The Western Historians were desperate for primary sources on the conflict, especially about Operation Barbarossa, and since the Soviets weren't exactly eager to share, they ended up relying on the Wehrmacht memoirs. Soviet historians would often criticize Western historians for their over reliance on Wehrmacht primary sources. \n\n\n**The Crimes of the Wehrmacht** \n\nThe most egregious claims made by Wehrmacht apologists is the idea that the Wehrmacht didn't commit war crimes and that the crimes were always the result of the dastardly SS. This claim is the most “offensive”, but its probably also the easiest part to debunk. \n\nThe Wehrmacht's behaviour in Poland not only set the tone for how the Wehrmacht would act in the Soviet Union, but it also foreshadowed just how brutal the entire war would be. In the village of Wawer, near Warsaw a drunk Polish farmer got into a fight with a German soldier, the Pole produced a knife and managed to wound the German soldier. The reprisal was savage. The local German unit carried out mass killings in the village, and ended up slaughtering 122 people. But that wasn't enough, they proceeded to stop a commercial train heading for Warsaw, the Germans pulled random people off of the train and executed them as well. Their corpses were left hanging in the train station as a warning. \n\nThere is an account of a German soldier who's unit was attacked by a Polish sniper. They burned the village to the ground and his account of the event is chilling, and shows the inhumanity that the Wehrmacht cultivated. \n\n&gt;Burning houses, weeping women, screaming children, A picture of misery. But the Polish people didn't want it any better. In one of the primitive peasant houses we even surprised a woman servicing a machine gun. The house was turned over and set alight. After a short while the woman was surrounded by flames and tried to get out. But we stopped her, as hard as it was. Soldiers can;t be treated differently just because they're in skirts. Her screaming rang in my ears long after. By the time the military administration of Poland ended in late October, the Germans had killed over 16,000 Poles and burned over 500 villages. \n\nThere is another case where a German colonel, angered by the loss of some his men in a gun battle near Ciepielow, had nearly 300 Polish POWs lined up against a wall and shot. The German army also collaborated with local militias to round up Poles and Jews and execute them. Together, the Wehrmacht and these militias executed some 35,000 Poles and Jews. \n\nBut moving onto the Eastern Front, where the vast majority of the Wehrmacht's war crimes were committed. Germany was determined to take advantage of the material wealth of the Soviet Union, as such units were ordered to live off the land. This meant that the Wehrmacht had full clearance to loot Soviet villages and to take whatever materials they felt were necessary to keep themselves alive. These requisitions came at the expense of the local population. In the span of one month, the 12th Infantry Division took over forty tons of meat, 112 tons of oat, 760 tons of hay, 32 heads of cattle, 65 sheep, 94 pigs, 2 tons of potatoes, 770 pounds of butter, 2000 eggs, and over 2000 litres of milk. This was just one infantry division, there were over 150 divisions involved in the invasion of the Soviet Union. This meant that the civilian populace had no food, and due to the German policy of burning villages suspected of harbouring partisans, had no shelter. The Germans introduced a ration system for civilians, but the Army only gave rations to those who could work in the fields, meaning that pregnant women, children, the elderly, and the sick were left to starve. The Wehrmacht when it was retreating created what were called “Desert Zones” which were areas where all the villages had been burned, and all the local wells poisoned, meaning that no life could be sustained in these areas. They would also conscript all the local males for building duty or send them back to Germany as slave labour, the women and children would be left for dead. \n\nAnother factor in the Wehrmacht's brutality was the famous “Commissar” order which stated that any subversive communist elements, like the Soviet Commissars should be handed over to the SS Einsatzgruppen for immediate execution. This sanctioning of brutality against POWs gave the Wehrmacht free licence to enact its own campaign of extermination and slaughter of the local population. Somewhere in the vicinity of 600,000 POWs were shot outright. The Germans in response to increasing partisan attacks, began to retaliate with brutal efficiency. Entire villages were liquidated on the mere suspicion that they were harbouring soldiers. In one case, in Belorussia, a Wehrmacht commander claimed that he had taken 10,940 “partisans” hostage (in fact they were most likely unarmed civilians) and then went on to have 10,400 of them shot. In one year from 1941 to 1942, security units of the Army had killed 80,000 Partisans and “Suspected Partisans”. The Wehrmacht also played a central role in rounding up Jews and aiding the Einsatzgruppen. They were involved heavily in the massacres of Jews at Babi Yar and the other famous mass killings of Jews. At Babi Yar they were responsible for rounding up the Jews in Kiev, and guarding the area while the Einsatzgruppen carried out the executions of some 33,000 Jews. The Wehrmacht also played a vital role in supplying and aiding the various anti-Jewish militias that sprang up in areas like Lithuania and Ukraine. \n\nRape was also a massive issue in the Wehrmacht. To the point where the incidence of venereal disease among the German army reached 10%. The army established over 200 military brothels, these were staffed by young women that were forcefully taken by the Wehrmacht from occupied territories, very much like the “Comfort Women” system in Japan. But this did very little to stem the tide of sexual violence against the local Soviet population The numbers for these rapes are next to impossible to calculate, but the number has been estimated to be as high as 10 million. \n\nIn any discussion on war crimes, the phrase “They were just following orders” will no doubt crop up as some sort of defence, but this defence can not be applied to the actions of the Wehrmacht. The German high command had indeed instructed its men to act with a certain brutality and ideological fervor, but when it became clear that Germany was in for the long hall, the German high command tried to curb the violence, rape, and looting, to little effect.  The war crimes listed above just scratch the surface of the various crimes that were committed by the Wehrmacht during WW2. Indeed entire books could be devoted to the topic of just listing everything that the Wehrmacht did wrong during the war.\n\n\n**Why did this happen**\n\nSimply put, the lack of any sort of disciplinary standards and an ideological devotion to Hitler and National Socialism are the root cause of the Wehrmacht's behaviour in the East. Nazi Germany did try and curb the Wehrmacht's excesses in regards to the West. Troops caught raping or looting in the West could expect death or a serious prison sentence. That same level of discipline was not carried over to the campaigns in Poland and the Soviet Union. The military code was tossed out the window, and instead troops were told that as long as they did their duty, they would not face  punishment for their various illicit activities. However, in regards to offences that directly influenced combat (desertion, cowardice,etc.) the penalties increased massively, and there was a surge of executions for crimes like desertion, cowardice, refusing the orders of a superior officer, and subversion. By 1943 the number of trials, per month, had reached over 4,000. Even minor offences such as returning late from leave could result in a serious prison sentence or even death by firing squad. Germany court martialled about 1.5 million soldiers, and only 5,000 were tried for rape, and most of those soldiers convicted were given light sentences or slaps on the wrist. Showing that the Wehrmacht took a very loose approach to discipline when it came to crimes like rape, looting, or murder of civilians. The German officers figured that allowing their troops to terrorize the local populace would allow their soldiers to unleash pent up anger and aggression that would otherwise be turned against the German establishment. So discipline in the Wehrmacht was enforced through a combination of stiff penalties and a licence to abuse the local populace. \n\nThere was also an ideological slant to the Wehrmacht's aggression. The famous speech given by Hitler to his subordinates on the eve of Barbarossa outlined that this would not be your usual invasion, rather this was a war of ideologies. Two competing ideologies, National Socialism and Bolshevism, were going to be involved in this war, and Hitler emphasized that only one could win. The Wehrmacht was to wage a war of extermination against the Soviet people and their political system. Many young German soldiers had grown up in Hitler's Germany and had been imbued with the idea that Judeo-Bolshevism was the root cause of the world's suffering, and that if they did not fight with the utmost ruthlessness to destroy it, then it would consume Germany and all of Europe. There was also a quasi religious aspect to the Wehrmacht that became very evident in the later years of the war. As the Nazi war machine proved increasingly unable to deal with the Soviet threat, they hoped to bolster their fighting effectiveness by instilling an almost fanatical devotion to Hitler and the ideals of National Socialism. Images of Hitler as a god leading Germany into a battle became common. The tenants of Blitzkrieg, and the aggressive spirit that had characterized Germany's war effort in 1939-1941 were characterized as mythical achievements, only possible because of Adolf Hitler's military genius. Contrary to popular belief that only the SS was indoctrinated, regular Wehrmacht soldiers and officers would have spent time learning the tenants of Nazi ideology and they received considerable ideological training.\n\nThe Wehrmacht's brutality is really put in perspective, and can almost be “understood” when you understand that they were fighting on behalf of a figure who they had been brainwashed into thinking was God's gift to Germany, and that, in their minds, they were fighting sub human animals who's sole intention was the destruction of Germany. I hope that I've completely done away with the idea that the Wehrmacht did not commit atrocities and the ludicrous idea that the Wehrmacht was somehow immune to the ideological fanaticism that plagued the rest of German society.\n\nThe two main sources I kept close by while writing this post were \"Hitler's Army\" by Omer Bartov and \"Wehrmacht: History, Myth, and Reality\" by Wolfram Wette.

        "text": "In a recent /r/badhistory thread, /u/anthropology_nerd criticized a particular argument surrounding the spread of epidemic diseases in the New World and pointed to Jared Diamond as an example. Naturally, this lead to a standard hissy fit between supporters and detractors of Jared Diamond. This appears to be a recurring motif at /r/badhistory. Even though the overwhelming majority of the academic world sees Jared Diamond as mediocre at best and a total crackpot at worst, he seems to have a loyal following of fans who are ready to jump to his defense any time he is questioned. In fact, I more than expect some to show up here. \n\nPart of the problem is that there aren't really any thorough rebuttals of his work available on the web. There are a few reviews by credible anthropologists and historians, but they tend to be short and generalized in their descriptions of the book. They attack it's (il)logical underpinnings, it's Eurocentrism, and the over-generalizations that characterize the book. Frequently reviews mention inaccuracies or selective omission of evidence, but they don't provide a detailed, point-by-point refutation which seems to be what people want. The reason for this is primarily that no one scholar is an expert on everything the book covers. People who have a background in one or two topics covered by the book will be quick to recognize mistakes on that topic, but they have a difficult time refuting the work as a whole because of how broad it is. This makes it easy for his supporters to claim that critiques don't really address the book directly, and are instead attacking strawmen.\n\nFrankly, I'm sick of people defending Guns Germs and Steel. I've decided what we need is a thorough refutation of the book which goes chapter by chapter, shredding the argument systematically. Unfortunately, I suffer from the same problem most other reviewers do. I'm not an expert in everything, as much as I would really like to be. So instead, I'm going to limit my comments to the material about which I am qualified to discuss. Specifically, I'm going to address Chapter 3: Collision at Cajamarca. My hope is that other knowledgeable posters can expand on this by looking at other parts of the book.\n\nI've chosen this chapter because my background is on New World civilizations, but also because in my view it is the perfect example of what's wrong with Jared Diamond's arguments. Although I do not expect that diehard fans of Diamond will ever be truly converted (he's almost like a cult at this point), it is my hope that by outlining the specific errors made in this chapter people can begin to see why Jared Diamond is completely full of shit.\n\n**Setting the Stage**\n\nDiamond opens chapter 3 of Guns, Germs, and Steel by introducing the showdown between Francisco Pizarro and the Inca Emperor Atahualpa at Cajamarca.\n\n&gt;Pizarro, leading a ragtag group of 168 Spanish soldiers, was in unfamiliar terrain, ignorant of the local inhabitants, and completely out of touch with the nearest Spaniards... far beyond the reach of timely reach of timely reinforcements. Atahuallpa was in the middle of his own empire of millions of subjects and immediately surrounded by his army of 80,000 soldiers, recently victorious in a war with other Indians. (p.62)\n\nThis is misleading. Although the figures he gives are accurate, Atahuallpa was not \"immediately surrounded\" by an army of 80,000 soldiers. Instead, his army was camped some distance away. Atahuallpa went to meet with Pizarro with a much smaller escort that was entirely unarmed. So it's not like 168 soldiers defeated 80,000 soldiers. Rather, 168 soldiers massacred a small group of unarmed attendants. Diamond tells it this way because it sounds more dramatic and makes the European victory look like it was a function of inherent superiority. Additionally, the \"other Indians\" that Atahuallpa had defeated were in fact supporters of a rival claimant to the Inca throne. It was a civil war, and the faction that was hostile to Atahualpa was still around - this will be important later.\n\n&gt;Atahuallpa's capture was decisive for the European conquest of the Inca Empire. Although the Spaniards' superior weapons would have assured an ultimate Spanish victory in any case, the capture made the conquest quicker and infinitely easier. Atahuallpa was revered by the Incas as a sungod, and exercised absolute authority over his subjects, who obeyed even the orders he issued from captivity. (p.63)\n\nWrong on two counts. First, Atahualpa did not have absolute authority over his subjects. Quite the opposite actually. The upper class of the Inca nobility belonged to a series of royal clans called *panaqas*. Half of the panaqas supported Atahuallpa, but half of them had supported his rival in the civil war, Huascar. Although Huascar had recently been defeated, there was still lots of resentment. So a huge chunk of the Inca empire's ruling class was still against Atahualpa. Additionally, since the Inca empire had expanded from a single city-state to a 2,000,000 sq. km. empire within less than a century, they certainly did not have absolute authority over all of their conquered peoples - many of which were eager to side with the Spanish in order to throw off the yoke of Inca imperialism. In fact, Pizarro killed Atahuallpa because some natives who were hostile to Atahuallpa convinced Pizarro that the Inca were sending an army to rescue him. (They weren't; the natives were using Pizarro for their own political ends.) Second, the capture of Atahuallpa didn't make things that much easier for the Spanish. Eliminating Atahuallpa certainly helped the Spanish get on good terms with Atahuallpa's enemies within the empire, but all it really did was re-ignite the civil war. The fighting between different factions within the Inca empire resumed and wouldn't end until 1572 when the Inca government-in-exile at Vilcabamba was crushed. And even then there were numerous rebellions in the ensuing centuries. Spain's control over the Inca empire was tenuous at best during the Early Colonial period. \n\nDiamond introduces Cajamarca as *the* decisive moment when the Inca empire fell. It wasn't. One could just as easily point to the death of Huayna Capac, the killing of Manco Inca, or the Toledo Reforms of the 1470s, or a number of other monumental events that resulted in Spanish dominance. But instead of presenting the complex web of cause and effect surrounding the conquest, Diamond has picked this one event as the turning point of history. This moment was chosen because it highlights European superiority - or at least it does the way Diamond tells the story.\n\nDiamond then quotes at length from conquistador accounts of the conflict, before moving onto the meat of the chapter, addressed as a series of questions.\n\n**Why did Pizarro capture Atahuallpa?**\n\nDiamond's answer? Technology.\n\n&gt;Pizarro's military advantages lay in the Spaniards' steel swords and other weapons, steel armor, guns, and horses... Such imbalances of equipment were decisive in innumerable other confrontations of Europeans with Native Americans and other peoples. The sole Native Americans able to resist European conquest for many centuries were those tribes that reduced the military disparity by acquiring and mastering both guns and horses. (p.69)\n\nReally? Cause I can think of a few examples that violate this rule. The Maya of Yucatan and Southern Lowlands held out for quite a while - the last city-state fell in 1697. And immediately after this, Maya in the Yucatan rose up and broke away from Spain for another few decades before they were subdued again. Superior numbers, favorable terrain, and organized resistance can also impact a people's ability to resist invasion even in the face of superior military technology.\n\n&gt;Today it is hard for us to grasp the enormous numerical odds against which the Spaniards' military equipment prevailed. At the battle of Cajamarca recounted above, 168 Spaniards crushed a Native American army 500 times more numerous, killing thousands without losing a single Spaniard. (p.70)\n\nYeah again, this is total bullshit. The Inca were unarmed and the bulk of the army wasn't involved. There are several examples of battles where the Spanish won against native armies through technological superiority, but this isn't one of them. All this proves is that people with weapons can beat people without weapons. That hardly proves anything.\n\n&gt;Time and again, accounts of Pizarro's subsequent battles with the Incas, Cortés's conquest of the Aztecs, and other early European campaigns against Native Americans describe encounters in which a few dozen European horsemen routed thousands of Indians with great slaughter. (p.70)\n\nUncritical use of primary sources is a hallmark of bad history. The conquistadors were not a neutral party whose accounts can be accepted at face value. The Spanish government was deeply concerned by the autonomy and power that conquistadors had. They were afraid that the conquistadors were going to set themselves up as kings within the conquered territory - and indeed many of them tried. As a result, almost immediately the Spanish colonial government began enacting reforms that aimed to limit the power of individual conquistadors. Most of the accounts from conquistadors were written during this period when the conquistadors were being replaced by a more formal colonial bureaucracy. As a result, the conquistador accounts tend to be self-glorifying; they're trying to promote their own accomplishments to justify their relevance within the evolving political landscape. They make it sound like it was just a few of them against an onslaught of overwhelming native armies. In fact, their success depended on the support of native allies who did the bulk of the fighting. The conquistadors acted more like reserve shock troops - helping to break up enemy formations so that their native allies could prevail. For a credible source on this, I would refer you to *The Last Days of the Inca* by Kim MacQuarrie. Additionally, Chapter 3 of Matthew Restall's *Seven Myths of the Spanish Conquest* talks about this - It's about the Aztecs, but it applies equally to the Inca. If you don't feel like reading a whole book, the Nova special *The Great Inca Rebellion* explains this quite well, and is [available on youtube.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wq_21QfGRpg)\n\n&gt;These Spanish victories cannot be written off as due merely to the help of Native American allies... The initial successes of both Pizarro and Cortés did attract native allies. However, many of them would not have become allies if they had not already been persuaded, by earlier devastating successes of unassisted Spaniards, that resistance was futile and that they should side with the likely winners.\n\nNo. No, no, no, and no. Seriously, has Diamond read *anything* on this topic written in the last 40 years? The truth is in fact quite the opposite of this. The Spanish didn't start reliably winning battles until *after* they acquired native allies. Before Cortés and Pizarro succeeded, there were several conquistadors who failed. Juan de Grijalva and Francisco Cordoba both attempted to take on a minor Maya city-state in the Western Yucatan and got the crap kicked out of them. Alexio Garcia led an expedition into the Inca Empire before Pizarro and was soundly crushed. Need I also discuss the hilariously disastrous incursions by conquistadors into the Amazon? All of these failed conquistadors were equipped with the same superior weapons and armor. Strategic use of native allies were the decisive difference between the failures and the successes. Cortés was able to secure an alliance from the Totonac province of Cempoala almost immediately after setting foot inside the Aztec Empire - without fighting a single battle against them. And even after that he was only able to fight Tlaxcala to a stalemate. Once he got more allies he started doing better. On the Inca end, Cajamarca didn't really count as a battle because one side was unarmed. And literally every other battle that the Spanish fought in both the Inca and Aztec empires involved native allies, most of whom are either absent or underrepresented in the Spanish accounts. Again, I'll refer you to Restall's book on that topic.\n\nHe then goes through a description of Spanish and Indian armaments and explains how the Spanish armaments gave them a clear advantage. He points to some specific examples regarding the devastating power of cavalry:\n\n&gt;When Quizo Yupanqui, the best general of the Inca emperor Manco, who succeeded Atahuallpa, besieged the Spaniards in Lima in 1536 and tried to storm the city, two squadrons of Spanish cavalry charged a much larger Indian force on flat ground, killed Quizo and all of his commanders in the first charge, and routed the army. (p. 72)\n\nThat's not what happened. That's the way the conquistadors present it, but again they're exaggerating their own involvement and downplaying the role of native allies. (See Chapter 9 of MacQuarrie 2007). The siege of Lima really boiled down to a series of small-scale skirmishes that were predominantly native v. native. Although the Spanish were certainly involved, in fact the Inca general Quizo Yupanqui actually ambushed and eliminated four columns of Spanish soldiers sent to Lima to break up the siege. The idea that the entire battle could be boiled down to a single cavalry charge that won the day is a narrative largely invented by the conquistadors. That Nova documentary I linked above covers this topic. If Diamond had bothered to familiarize himself with the modern scholarship on the conquest, he'd know this. Or maybe he did know it, but chose to ignore the competing evidence because it didn't fit his thesis.\n\n**How did Atahuallpa come to be at Cajamarca?**\n\nIn this section, Diamond finally acknowledges that at least part of the Spaniards success came from political divisions within the Inca empire relating to the civil war - although he continues to downplay it's significance in later events of the conquest. He describes the civil war as significant in leading up to Cajamarca, but having no other role beyond that. What caused this civil war? Diamond says smallpox.\n\nI have no real qualms with this section; although it has not been conclusively established that Huayna Capac died from smallpox, that is the leading interpretation. However, I would point out that the death of Huayna Capac was simply the proximate cause for a civil war that was way more complicated than he presents - and continued well after the Spanish \"conquest.\" Further, the devastating 95% casualty rate that Diamond ascribes to epidemic diseases in this section represents a slow and gradual decline within the Andes. Most of that demographic collapse post-dates the conquest, and so can't really be considered a deciding factor of the conquest itself.\n\n**How did Pizarro come to be at Cajamarca? Why didn't Atahuallpa instead try to conquer Spain?**\n\nAnd here we have the crux of it. In this section, Diamond attempts to tie his extremely skewed version of the Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire to a larger narrative about European expansion. His answer, ultimately, is that the Spanish had access to naval technology that allowed them to cross the Atlantic Ocean, while the Inca did not. That is clearly true. If he had stopped there, this section would have been fine. However, he does not stop with naval technology. Following the general theme of his writings, Jared Diamond feels the need to push an argument way further than logic permits.\n\n&gt;In addition to the ships themselves, Pizarro's presence depended on the centralized political organization that enabled Spain to finance, build, staff, and equip the ships. The Inca Empire also had a centralized political organization, but that actually worked to its disadvantage, because Pizarro seized the Inca chain of command by capturing Atahuallpa. Since the Inca bureaucracy was so strongly identified with its godlike absolute monarch, it disintegrated with Atahuallpa's death. Maritime technology coupled with political organization was similarly essential for European expansions to other continents, as well as for expansions of many other peoples. (p. 73-74)\n\n... What? Somebody explain this to me, because I don't get it. Centralization is an advantage that Europeans had because it allowed them to finance and direct expeditions to the New World. At the same time, centralization was a disadvantage to the Inca. So... centralization + naval technology = good, but centralization - naval technology = bad? The only way that I can interpret this is to mean that centralization was irrelevant, since it may be advantageous in some circumstances and disadvantageous in others. He presents political centralization as if it's one of the major advantages that Europeans held over the Inca. (A point reiterated on page 76.) And yet, by his own admission, the Inca empire was much the same as Spain on that count. So what's his point?\n\nAlso, the whole idea that the Inca empire collapsed because Atahuallpa was the keystone holding it all together is baseless. As he literally just explained in the previous section, there was a civil war that had been raging before the Spanish arrived and continued well after. If anything, Atahuallpa was a divisive figure who was hated by half his subjects, and his elimination simply shifted the balance of power from one faction to another. \n\n**Why did Atahuallpa walk into the trap?**\n\nThis entire section is devoted to the naiveté of native peoples. Oh god...\n\nTwo of my favorite examples.\n\n&gt;Although the Spanish conquest of Panama, a mere 600 miles from the Incas' northern boundary, began in 1510, no knowledge even of the Spaniards' existence appears to have reached the Incas until Pizarro's first landing on the Peruvian coast in 1527. (p. 75)\n\nThis is technically true, but only because Alexio Garcia (who entered the Inca empire in 1525) was Portuguese. Also, the Inca Empire had only recently conquered it's northernmost boundaries. So it's not really surprising that they didn't know much about the people living further to the north. The distance between the Inca capital and Panama is about 1,300 miles, and the cultural gap between the Andes and Central America is enormous. How many eastern Europeans were aware of events happening in Baghdad in the Middle Ages?\n\n&gt;The Aztec emperor Montezuma [sic] miscalculated even more grossly when he took Cortés for a returning god and admitted him and his tiny army into the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan. (p. 75)\n\nBullshit. That never happened. That's a myth that arose during and after the conquest through a combination of translation errors and other issues. It was promoted part of the conversion efforts of Motolinia and other missionaries, who found it easier to convert the natives to Christianity if the natives saw the conquest as ordained by prophecy. Matthew Restall's book covers this, and I've written about it in an Askhistorians post [here](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1rgsfl/is_there_any_truth_to_the_commonly_cited_fact/).\n\n&gt;On a mundane level, the miscalculations by Atahuallpa, Chalcuchima, and Montezuma [sic], and countless other Native American leaders deceived by Europeans were due to the fact that no living inhabitants of the New World had been to the Old World, so of course they could have no specific information about the Spaniards. (p.75)\n\nYes. That would be a logical conclusion to draw. Please stop there.\n\n&gt;Pizarro too arrived at Cajamarca with no information about the Incas... However, while Pizarro himself happened to be illiterate, he belonged to a literate tradition. From books, the Spaniards knew of many contemporary civilizations remote from Europe, and about several thousand years of European history... In short, literacy made the Spaniards heirs to a huge body of knowledge about human behavior and history. By contrast, not only did Atahuallpa have no conception of the Spaniards themselves, and no personal experience of any other invaders from overseas, but he also had not even heard (or read) of similar threats to anyone else, anywhere else, anytime previously in history. That gulf of experience encouraged Pizarro to set his trap, and Atahuallpa to walk into it. (p. 76)\n\nWhat the *fuck*? Seriously? Are you fucking *kidding me*? Jared Diamond just argued that the Inca empire was conquered because they were illiterate. This is going to take a whole goddamn essay to dissect.\n\nFirst, as Diamond points out, Pizarro was illiterate, as were many of conquistadors who largely came from the impoverished *Extramadura* region of Spain. *Some* Spaniards had read books about other cultures, but Pizarro wasn't one of them, because he couldn't fucking read. Second, I'm going to need to see some documentation that a typical Spaniard from the late 15th and early 16th century \"knew of many contemporary civilizations remote from Europe.\" Certainly they had lots of experience dealing with Muslims, especially those from North Africa, and probably some minimal exposure to sub-Saharan West Africans, but outside of that I'm not sure that's true. Obviously, by this point they had encountered numerous other Native American cultures, but this was not a function of their “literate tradition,” it's because they were conquering them. There were likely some conquistadors that had read about Marco Polo (or something similar), so they might have some faint knowledge about cultures further east, but obviously Pizarro hadn't read any of Marco Polo's accounts because *he couldn't fucking read.* His illiteracy meant that his knowledge of other cultures would only have been acquired by him through personal experience or oral transmission. Which really, wouldn't have made him that different from Atahuallpa on that count, except that Atahuallpa had qhipus.\n\nBut moreover, how does illiteracy translate to gullibility? The fact that the Inca record-keeping system didn't directly record spoken language somehow meant that they would be unaware of the concept of an ambush? That's insane, especially given the fact that the Inca themselves used ambushes in their wars of conquest, as did many other Native American cultures including other Andean civilizations that the Inca interacted with. Furthermore, Pizarro himself was killed in a surprise attack when soldiers loyal to his rival Almagro stormed his palace and assassinated him. So when Pizarro was killed by surprise attack, I suppose that was just a unique historical event with no wider implications, but when Atahuallpa was killed by surprise attack, it's an indication of the inferiority of his civilization. By Diamond's logic, shouldn't Pizarro's \"literate tradition\" have informed him of the possibility of Almagro's betrayal? I mean, come on, hadn't he read about Julius Ceaser? Oh wait no. He couldn't fucking read.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nDiamond has made a fundamental mistake in this chapter, which underlies every other error. In the introduction of the book Jared Diamond outlines his professional training as a biogeographer. He describes how he was working in Papua when a troubling question formed in his mind, prompted by another question from a friend. Why had his people developed advanced technology, while the people of New Guinea had not? This is what fostered his interest into anthropology and history, and prompted him to write the book. I do not know his thought process beyond that, other than what he has placed on paper. But as I've seen similar mistakes to these before, allow me to posit a guess. \n\nWhen Jared Diamond began researching the anthropology of the New World civilizations, he appears to have read a few secondary sources, and then dove directly into the primary source material, specifically the accounts provided by the conquistadors. He would have noticed a problem right away – the version of events that modern historians gave in their books contradicted what the primary sources said. Diamond, thinking like a scientist, saw the primary sources as the raw data. Secondary sources were synthesis and interpretation. So naturally, he rejected the viewpoints of modern scholars as baseless, and took the accounts of the conquistadors at face value.\n\nI know people get mad when others criticize him for being “not an anthropologist” or “not a historian,” but this is exactly the kind of thing that historical or anthropological training teaches you not to do. Primary sources must be employed critically. You cannot assume that any informant is giving you an unbiased account. And in fact, it's probably a good idea to assume that the person writing a document about a historical event that they participated in is giving you a *very* biased account. The conquistador accounts of the Spanish conquest make it sound like the Spanish were super-human, and did everything by themselves with no outside assistance – defeating entire armies with a flick of their wrist. When you place this in the context of who the conquistadors were, what they were doing, and *why* they were writing the accounts, then you have to treat this with extreme skepticism. A historian would compare these biased accounts with other historical and archaeological sources, examine the history of their interpretation, and look at how contemporary readers of the accounts reacted to them. Historians have done these things, and concluded that the conquistadors were exaggerating to make themselves look better, and that the majority of the conquest depended on alliances forged with native groups who sought to use the Spanish to advance their own political agenda. Diamond did not do this, took the conquistadors at their word, and concluded that they were victorious through direct application of superior military force, without substantial native assistance. \n\nThrough this butchered rendering of history, he's arrived at a conclusion that he already had before he began writing: the European conquests in the Americas were an inevitable result of European superiority. And to Diamond, this superiority goes beyond the specific technologies that Europeans used, such as trans-atlantic sailing, weapons, and armor. By Diamond's reckoning, the difference between native civilizations and European ones was not simply a question of specific technologies and cultural idiosyncrasies; the native civilizations were *categorically* inferior. Their lack of specific technologies is equated with a lack of intellectual sophistication. The naiveté he ascribes to the Inca makes them seem like children who lacked the wisdom and experience of their more sophisticated European counterparts. They cowered helplessly in fear of their new European overlords, as the unstoppable conquistadors rolled through armies that outnumbered them 1,000 to 1 like a twelve-pound ball through bowling pins.\n\nThere's nothing particularly new about this telling of the conquest - this blatantly Eurocentric narrative has dominated the history of colonialism for centuries. It was especially loved by whig historians and 19th century anthropologists, who used it to justify the idea of the linear advancement of mankind, and treated it as a prelude to their own colonial dominance of the world. Diamond is simply uncritically regurgitating it, and passing that on to a new generation of readers so that it can survive in the minds of the public for decades to come. Indeed, the way he presents it in Guns, Germs, and Steel, it reads like it's simply the obvious conclusion to draw. If the point of the book (\"Yali's Question\") can be paraphrased as \"Why did Europe come to dominate the world?\" Diamond's immediate answer delivered in Chapter 3 is, \"because Europe was technologically and culturally superior.\" The rest of the book then tries to address \"Why was Europe superior?\" as if he has already solved the first part of the problem. He hasn't; he's twisted the Spanish conquest of the Inca empire into a strawman for advancing the idea of European superiority, and anybody who is actually educated on that topic can see it.\n\n-----\n\nSoures for a more accurate telling of the Spanish Conquest:\n\n* MacQuarrie, Kim. 2007. *The Last Days of the Inca* Simon an Schuster Paperbacks.

        "text": "So [this](http://www.queerty.com/was-founding-father-alexander-hamilton-bisexual-his-letters-suggest-so-20140704) article has been going around my tumblr feed, claiming that Alexander Hamilton was bisexual, all based on some of Hamilton's letters. It's not a new argument, and many people have made it, but the evidence is not nearly as conclusive as those who advocate this theory might wish for.\n\nThe article starts of saying this:\n\n&gt;Though he married Elizabeth Schuyler in 1780 and fathered a total of eight children, some historians believe Hamilton had a romantic relationship with fellow solider and aristocrat John Laurens while both men were aide-de-camps to George Washington during the Revolutionary War.\n\nThe first letter offered for proof is [this one](http://founders.archives.gov/documents/Hamilton/01-02-02-0100):\n\n&gt;In a letter dated April 1779, Hamilton begins:\n\n&gt;Cold in my professions, warm in my friendships, I wish, my Dear Laurens, it might be in my power, by action rather than words to convince you that I love you. I shall only tell you that ’til you bade us Adieu, I hardly knew the value you had taught my heart to set upon you. Indeed, my friend, it was not well done. You know the opinion I entertain of mankind, and how much it is my desire to preserve myself free from particular attachments, and to keep my happiness independent of the caprice of others. You should not have taken advantage of my sensibility to steal into my affections without my consent.\n\nThe language certainly is rather more flowery than we're used to as modern readers. However, it was not uncommon in the 18th century for men to write this way to each other--especially for soldiers to write this way. Here are some examples of how Lafayette wrote and talked about George Washington.\n\n\"I also candidly profess that private affection for you makes me hate the idea of leaving the man I love most in the world  . . . at a period when he may want me.\"\n\n\"I must tell you I received this favor with the greatest satisfaction and pleasure. Every assurance and proof of your affection fills my heart with joy because that sentiment of yours is extremely dear and precious to me.\"\n\nIn his memoirs he talks about a time after a battle when \"the general and he slept on the same cloak\"\n\n\"He is going to be alone. You know how tenderly I love him.\"\n\nRochambeau's aid, the count de Dumas was \"particularly struck by with the marks of affection which the general showed to his pupil . . .\"\n\nSo the language alone is not enough to declare that Hamilton was attracted to Laurens sexually, or that they had a romantic relationship. \n\n&gt;All that flowery language certainly does sound kinda — well — gay.\n\nYes, because gay men are so flowery\n\n&gt;The letter continues:\n\n&gt;\"But as you have done it, and as we are generally indulgent to those we love, I shall not scruple to pardon the fraud you have committed, on condition that for my sake, if not for your own, you will always continue to merit the partiality, which you have artfully instilled into me.\"\n\n&gt;At the time, romantic relationships between members of the same sex were considered taboo, and sodomy was a punishable offense in all 13 colonies. \n\n&gt;Which raises the question of what sort of “fraud” Hamilton might be referring to.\n\nWell the full text of the letter makes it rather clear what Hamilton is talking about.\n\n\"You know the opinion I entertain of mankind, and how much it is my desire to preserve myself free from particular attachments, and to keep my happiness independent on the caprice of others. You sh&lt;ould&gt; not have taken advantage of my sensibility to ste&lt;al&gt; into my affections without my consent. But as you have done it and as we are generally indulgent to those we love, I shall not scruple to pardon the fraud you have committed, on condition that for my sake, if not for your own, you will always continue to merit the partiality, which you have so artfully instilled into &lt;me&gt;.\"\n\nThe \"fraud\" that Hamilton is talking about is Laurens becoming extremely close friends with Hamilton. Reading anything else into it (like a sexual relationship) is taking the text too far.\n\n&gt;In another letter, dated September 1779, Hamilton describes himself as a “jealous lover” after Laurens failed to respond to any of his missives:\n\n&gt;Like a jealous lover, when I thought you slighted my caresses, my affection was alarmed and my vanity piqued. I had almost resolved to lavish no more of them upon you and to reject you as an inconstant and an ungrateful _\n\n&gt;At that point, the handwriting becomes illegible, leaving it up to the reader’s imagination what the Founding Father may have written.\n\n[The context of the letter](http://founders.archives.gov/documents/Hamilton/01-02-02-0446) (dated September 11, 1779) makes it clear the context of Hamilton's remarks about being a \"jealous lover\"\n\n\"I acknowlege but one letter from you, since you left us, of the 14th of July which just arrived in time to appease a violent conflict between my friendship and my pride. I have written you five or six letters since you left Philadelphia and I should have written you more had you made proper return. But like a jealous lover, when I thought you slighted my caresses, my affection was alarmed and my vanity piqued. I had almost resolved to lavish no more of them upon you and to reject you as an inconstant and an ungrateful ——. But you have now disarmed my resentment and by a single mark of attention made up the quarrel. You must at least allow me a large stock of good nature.\"\n\nHamilton is saying he's a jealous lover. He's saying \"Dude, why haven't you written me in forever. I was starting to get really pissed off about it, but then your letter came and I realized I was really over-reacting.\"\n\n&gt;Later in the letter, Hamilton talks about his new fiance, Elizabeth Schuyler, in language that makes her sound more like a beard than a wife:\n\n&gt;Next fall completes my doom. I give up my liberty to Miss Schuyler. She is a good hearted girl who I am sure will never play the termagant; though not a genius she has good sense enough to be agreeable, and though not a beauty, she has fine black eyes – is rather handsome and has every other requisite of the exterior to make a lover happy. And believe me, I am lover in earnest, though I do not speak of the perfections of my Mistress in the enthusiasm of Chivalry.\n\nThe article's characterization of the letter is really mean-spirited. Hamilton could have waxed more poetic about his wife perhaps, but it was a paragraph at the end of a letter (and that might itself be indicative of a lack of desire for marriage, but it's not indicative of a desire for a relationship with Laurens).\n\nAlso the remarks about his doom are in regards to him giving up his freedom as a single man, as the rest of that letter shows. \n\n\"Have you not heard that I am on the point of becoming a benedict? I confess my sins. I am guilty. Next fall completes my doom. \"\n\nHere he's saying that he's about to become a Benedict (a particular order of monks where each group within the order maintains it's own autonomy while the Order as a whole works for the good of the group). The completion of doom is more of a reference to giving up some freedoms as a single man than it is horror at his prospective bride (whom he explicitly says is both beautiful and a great personality).\n\n&gt;One year later, in a letter dated September 1780, Hamilton again wrote to Laurens about his wife:\n\n&gt;In spite of Schuyler’s black eyes, I have still a part for the public and another for you; so your impatience to have me married is misplaced; a strange cure by the way, as if after matrimony I was to be less devoted that I am now. Let me tell you, that I intend to restore the empire of Hymen and that Cupid is to be his prime Minister.\n\nI'm not really sure how this is supposed to support the notion that Hamilton was bi-sexual. The phrase \"restore the empire of Hymen\" is a pretty clear reference to having sex with women\n\n&gt;He signed the letter:\n\n&gt;Adieu, be happy, and let friendship between us be more than a name.\n\n[Full text](http://founders.archives.gov/documents/Hamilton/01-02-02-0860) of that paragraph gives us more context\n\n\"In spite of Schuylers black eyes, I have still a part for the public and another for you; so your impatience to have me married is misplaced; a strange cure by the way, as if after matrimony I was to be less devoted than I am now. Let me tell you, that I intend to restore the empire of Hymen and that Cupid is to be his prime Minister. I wish you were at liberty to transgress the bounds of Pensylvania. I would invite you after the fall to Albany to be witness to the final consummation. My Mistress is a good girl, and already loves you because I have told her you are a clever fellow and my friend; but mind, she loves you a l’americaine not a la françoise.\n\nAdieu, be happy, and let friendship between us be more than a name\"\n\nThe reference to Pennsylvania is in regards to Laurens parole restrictions which stated he couldn't leave the state of Pennsylvania.\n\nVery clearly Hamilton states that Laurens is a friend. In the 18th century friendship meant rather something different than it does today. In the 18th century it implied a relationship between a patron and an adviser, or between someone with power and someone with less power. So a tenant might describe his landlord as a \"friend\" because the landlord could help sponsor the tenant. Gordon Wood talks about this notion extensively in [*The Radicalism of the American Revolution*](http://www.amazon.com/Radicalism-American-Revolution-Gordon-Wood/dp/0679736883)\n\nTowards the last quarter of the 18th century (and especially during and after the American Revolution), this notion changed dramatically. Sympathy (i.e. empathy) and egalitarianism were considered to be the primary ideals, and so what friendship meant needed to change. So two people of roughly equal stations in life might couch their friendship in terms of affection and love. To quote Caleb Crain's [*American Sympathy: Men, Friendship, and Literature in the New Nation*](http://www.amazon.com/American-Sympathy-Friendship-Literature-Nation/dp/0300083327)\n\n\"But as a metaphor and model for citizenly love, romantic friendship was more congenial to republican ideology than either filial or marital relationships. Romantic friendship was egalitarian. It could bind men without curtailing their liberty. (It could bind women, too, but because women were not full citizens, the political implications of their friendships were different.) Like confederation into civil society, friendship bestowed benefits that were other than financial or sexual\"\n\nSo was Alexander Hamilton bisexual? There's no evidence whatsoever that he engaged in any same-sex activities during his life.\n\nDid he have a romantic relationship with John Laurens that wasn't sexual? If we use the phrase \"romantic friendship\", then the answer is certainly yes. If we mean the idea that Hamilton had unrequited sexual urges towards Laurens, then the answer is \"there's no evidence\".\n\nSources:\n\n[*American Sympathy: Men, Friendship, and Literature in the New Nation*](http://www.amazon.com/American-Sympathy-Friendship-Literature-Nation/dp/0300083327) by Caleb Crain\n\n[*The Radicalism of the American Revolution*](http://www.amazon.com/Radicalism-American-Revolution-Gordon-Wood/dp/0679736883) by Gordon S.

        "text": "With the Centenary of the British entry into the First World War nearly at hand, I am moved to post a reminder about one of the more spurious and frustrating pieces of Bad History that is routinely trotted out in criticism of one of the war's most controversial figures: Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig.  Haig was Commander-in-Chief of the British Armies in France from the end of 1915 onward, having replaced Sir John French, and his post-war legacy [has been a complicated one to say the least](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1hfffk/monday_mysteries_contested_reputations/cattizk).  An initial wave of laudatory biographies of the Field Marshal gave way to more critical (and eventually scathing) assessments, but in recent years he has experienced something of a rehabilitation -- at least among academic historians.  His popular reputation remains as shabby as ever.\n\nOne frequently cited failing of Haig's was his unimaginative neglect of the machine gun as an important weapon.  This quote, widely attributed to him, is regularly offered in evidence of this:\n\n&gt; **\"The machine gun is a much-overrated weapon and two per battalion would be more than sufficient.\"** (Usually cited as coming from Haig in 1915, but taken as definitive of his perspective as a whole)\n\nThe claim that Haig was blindly opposed to machine guns flies in the face of numerous other well-attested declarations by him from both before and after the statement above was purported to have been made.\n\nThe genesis of this claim does not lie in any of Haig's own documents, first and foremost; the **sole** attestation of it comes from the memoirs of one Christopher Baker-Carr (*From Chauffeur to Brigadier*, 1930), a major who was put in charge of the BEF's new machine gun school in November of 1914.  Baker-Carr's narrative of his early days with this academy is one of consistent frustration with the army's general staff, who apparently resisted his suggested innovations every step of the way.  John Terraine, in an amazing chapter in *The Smoke and the Fire* (1980), has pretty definitively shown that this narrative is rather unlikely in its own right, as all existing records apart from Baker-Carr's memoirs indicate that the general staff basically did everything he suggested very quickly in spite of any reservations they might have had.  I mention this not to put a slight on Baker-Carr himself, who was a remarkably interesting and accomplished person, but rather to establish that his memoirs may not be the most reliable account of all that transpired and that a great deal of personal pique seems to have made its way into them.\n\nTo give an example of this fantasticality which is essential to the quote being discussed, at some point in late December of 1914 Baker-Carr forwarded an urgent suggestion to the staff that the number of machine guns deployed among front-line battalions should be doubled.  He describes in anger having received a number of seemingly unaccommodating notes in return, including one from \"an army commander\" saying that \"the machine-gun was a much over-rated weapon and two per battalion were more than sufficient.\"  We'll return to this in a few seconds, as it is the main focus of this post, but I will note first that the staff generals, contrary to Baker-Carr's unhappy declarations in his memoirs, *took his advice* and doubled the guns by February of 1915.  A mere two-month turnaround on doubling the number of guns among all front-line battalions -- at the urging of an untested officer representing a new training school -- would not seem to suggest foot-dragging or indifference on the staff's part, and this is even more apparent when manufacturing limitations are considered.  \n\nBy 1914 the Maxim was already on the way out.  Both the British and the Germans were using the heavy, outdated 1908 model, and the onset of the war inspired a flurry of redesign.  For the British this took the form of the new Vickers and Lewis guns; the former was far more reliable when it came to the problem of over-heating, and the latter was much, much more portable than any previous widely-adopted design.  The Germans stuck with the Maxims when it came to arming static gun emplacements, but also developed a portable counterpart to the Lewis, the Bergmann.\n\nAt the war's outset, the available machine guns would have been hard to widely distribute for anyone involved even if they did understand the weapon's merits.  The allocation of machine guns per infantry battalion was indeed two -- two, that is, for roughly a thousand men.  This was a matter of unhappy necessity rather than contented policy, however, as even though the War Office had placed a production order with Vickers for 196 new machine guns after the first week of the war, Vickers could only produce ten to twelve such guns per week.  It took time for the infrastructure necessary for widescale production to be developed, and it is in this context that any early-war statements on gun distribution should be considered.\n\nIn any event, let us turn to the quote itself.  \n\nFirst, Baker-Carr does not even explicitly say that it was Haig who said it -- only \"an army commander.\"  Insisting that this refers to Haig requires a number of stretches.  The first is that he meant \"army commander\" in a literal rather than general sense; just prior to the war, the numerous men to whom his brief was addressed would have been referred to as corps commanders -- \"army commander\" was a necessary creation to accommodate the vast expansion of the army in wartime, but was still often used in lieu of \"corps commander\" on a casual basis in spite of it having become a formal rank.  Which would mean that, in addition to just the two formal Army Commanders (note the capitals), who were Horace Smith-Dorrien and Douglas Haig, the comment could be referring to any of the following:\n\n- Charles Monro of I Corps\n- Charles Fergusson of II Corps\n- William Pulteney of III Corps\n- Henry Rawlinson of IV Corps\n- Herbert Plumer of V Corps\n- And John French, the Commander-in-Chief\n\nThere was also Edmund Allenby of the Cavalry Corps, but it seems very unlikely that his word on the subject would have mattered enough to Baker-Carr to put him out as much as he suggests.  The comment -- assuming it is being properly ascribed -- could have come from any of them.\n\nThe reader may, at this point, reasonably ask why it couldn't have been Horace Smith-Dorrien who provided the quote above.  The main thing militating against this is that he -- like Haig, as we shall shortly see -- had been and would continue to be an enthusiastic supporter of the machine gun throughout the war; nevertheless, unlike Haig, his career was abruptly terminated in 1915 after a personal falling-out with Sir John French.  He is remembered primarily for his fortuitous decision to have II Corps turn and stand at Le Cateau during the retreat from Mons, and his subsequent nine months as a general preceded any of the parts of the war that are generally conceived of as being so catastrophically dumb.  He never had to preside over subsequent, less-flashily-satisfying campaigns (like Loos, or the Somme, or Arras, or Passchendaele), and nobody consequently found it necessary to develop lurid conspiracies about his callousness, his incompetence, his lack of imagination, his barbarity, etc. etc., into which some later claim about an ignorance of the value of a certain weapon could be so easily integrated.\n\nHaig's own documents, by contrast, whether they be letters, dispatches or personal journals, are unequivocal in their support of machine guns as a necessary and much-desired innovation.  He took time out of his leave in January of 1898 to visit the Enfield gun works and see in both production and action the Maxim machine guns that they were then producing; his opinion of this weapon's usefulness can be seen in extracts from his written works.  Nothing he has written on the subject suggests any other attitude towards machine guns than that of serious respect.\n\nFrom his report on an ambush he experienced while serving in the Sudan in March of 1898, barely two months later:\n\n&gt; *The Horse Artillery against enemy of this sort is no use. We felt the want of machineguns when working alongside of scrub for searching some of the tracks.*\n\nFrom his *Review of the Work Done During the Training Season 1912*, a document aimed at bettering the proficiency of the cavalry:\n\n&gt; *More attention should be paid to the handling of cavalry machineguns when brigaded. Their drill and manoeuvre should, before departure to practice camp, attain a high standard of efficiency.*\n\nFrom the agenda for a conference among the senior officers of I Corps on August 20, 1914:\n\n&gt; *German machine-guns are said to be well commanded; the French are believed to have lost heavily by attacking them with infantry.*\n\nFrom a letter to his nephew, Oliver, November 1914:\n\n&gt; *You must not fret because you are not out here. There will be a great want of troops, and numbers are wanted. So I expect you will* **all** *soon be in the field. Meantime train your machine guns. It will repay you.*\n\n[Note: It was around this time that the new Vickers machine gun had come into production and the BEF was in the awkward process of transferring over to it from the older, bulkier Maxim model]\n\nFrom Haig's notes on a meeting between himself and Major-General Bannatine-Allason of the 51st Territorial Division in May of 1915:\n\n&gt; *Infantry peace-training was little use in teaching a company how to capture a house occupied by half a dozen machine-guns.  [Bannatine-Allason] should urge his men to operate at wide intervals, and use cover and try to bring a converging fire on the locality attacked.  We should also use our machine-guns as much as possible.*\n\nBy the next month, in a conference with then-Minister of Munitions David Lloyd George, Haig had already moved on from discussing the virtues of the guns that *did* exist to urging the manufacture of much lighter models -- which, in the event, did end up existing in the form of the far-more-portable Lewis guns.  In other venues he was showing a similar and insatiable interest in technological innovation; he cherished the aerial photography of the front lines which the RFC was able to provide him, and he was so enthusiastic about the possibilities afforded by the new \"tanks\" in 1916 that he may with some justice be said to have pushed them into action too early.  Even after their less than ideal debut at Flers, he placed an order for another thousand of the things to be delivered as swiftly as possible -- [another hope quashed by practical limitations](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1uys7h/how_influential_were_armored_vehicles_tanks/cen0syl).  There is nothing in any of this that seems reconcilable with the absurdity attributed to him in the oft-cited quote.\n\n**TL;DR:** \"Everyone knows\" that Sir Douglas Haig was an incompetent butcher who resisted technological innovations and who failed to understand the realities of the war that he was asking his men to fight.  It is very easy to imagine that such a person might have declared machine-guns to be overrated and of little use.  Unfortunately, the source for this claim comes from a single, non-specific sentence by a hostile memoirist writing on a different subject years after Haig's death, and the evidence about Haig's opinion of machine guns that we find in his own documents suggests rather the opposite view.",

        "text": "Michael Mann's 1992 adventure film *The Last of the Mohicans* is a fine movie, and it's probably one of the better looking 18th Century Period Pieces out there. /u/Lordkettering has [been over the film's use and misuse](http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/1wo9xl/by_popular_request_last_of_the_mohicans/) of history in narrative. And, really, there's no way I could top him. So I won't try. Instead, I'll focus on something near and dear to my heart- The Uniforms, Facings and Lace of the Mid-18th Century British Army. \n\nThere's one aspect of the film that's been bugging me- And that's the British Regiments portrayed in the movie. Now, leaving aside the company of the 60th (Royal Americans) who are ambushed early on in the film (the scene in question), most of the British Soldiers are meant to be members of the 35th Regiment of Foot. This regiment was present at the siege and subsequent surrender of Fort William Henry in 1757. The film makes it clear that this is indeed, the regiment portrayed- [The Roman Numeral XXXV](http://i.imgur.com/u1EoprC.jpg) proudly emblazoned on the regimental colours as the regulars take their solemn leave of the fort. Dale Dye, who served as military adviser on the film, [also states](http://www.warriorsinc.com/FilmTrain.cfm?ProjectID=20) that the 35th are the regiment on screen. \n\nHere we come to our first curiosity- The colours. There are three of them for some reason- A Blue Regimental one and the King's Colour can be seen in the first picture, while also present is [buff-colored flag](http://i.imgur.com/QKWNc89.jpg). Though obscure, this one also appears to bear the Roman Numeral 'XXXV'. British Regiments official, had only two Cplours- The first was the Regimental Colour, which bore the Regiment's number, usually surrounded by a laurel wreath, and was the color of the Regiment's facings. 'Facings' were probably the easiest way to distinguish one British regiment from another- Each regiment had it's own distinct color. The 35th's were Orange. Not Blue. The second Colour, the King's Colour, was the Union Flag with the Regimental number wreathed in the center. \n\nSo, in the film, we have a superfluous Flag- And one which is the wrong color at that- The carrying of which is no doubt wasting the talents of some Ensign, who should, by all rights, be dying a gory death in front of the camera. \n\nThe [costumes of the Regiment](http://i.imgur.com/ssKyU7E.jpg) themselves are rather good. The fit is correct (at least in the sleeves), for one thing, something which few films get right. The hats should probably be worn tilted forward over the right eye, but that's neither here nor there. What is here are two aspects of the '35th's' uniform- The aforementioned facings and lace. As depicted in the film, the soldiers wear uniform coats with buff-coloured facings, and lace loops with a distinctive green zig-zag pattern. Realistic, right? Particularly the pattern lace, which is a distinctive, indeed important, aspect of uniform often blissfully ignored by costumers in Film and Television. \n\nExcept these are neither the 35th's facings, nor their lace. Exhibit A- [A Grenadier of the 35th Regiment](http://i.imgur.com/wcSiDqi.jpg), painted by the Swiss Artist David Morier in 1751. The 'Grenadier Paintings' by Morier provide something of a snapshot of the British Army in the early part of the 1750's, and are a useful illustrated guide for the uniforms of the 7 Years War. Though the action of the film takes place some 6 years down the line from when the painting was executed, to my knowledge, no extensive changes in dress were made in the intervening time. As we can see from Morier's Grenadier, the 35th wore Orange, rather than Buff, facings- And lace with a red-and-yellow zig-zag pattern. The 'slash-and-frame' cuffs also bear a unique pattern of lace. The waist-coat, and pocket flaps, too, are profusely laced. And not in the manner as depicted in the film. \n\nSo if not the uniform of the 35th, what regiment are the soldier's wearing. I was willing to chock it up as an entirely fictitious garb- But there seemed to be too many unique features which no costumer (considering that breed's typical ignorance of historical record) could come up with all on their lonesome. There must have been a model. And, as it turns out, the model for the uniforms worn in the film lies slightly to the left of Morier's Grenadier of the 35th Regiment of Foot. The [Original Painting](http://i.imgur.com/UMBLrb4.jpg) depicts three Grenadiers, those of the 34th, 35th and 36th Regiment. We will now turn to the 34th's Grenadier, as the object of our attention. [As we can see](http://i.imgur.com/dP79tEW.jpg)- His facings are buff and has a green zig-zag pattern on his lace. Needless to say, the 34th were not present at Fort William Henry. \n\nNow- I have no evidence beyond the similarity between the film costumes and the figure in the painting. I'm *not* saying someone got the number mixed up, and based the design of the uniform off of the preceding regiment. Far be it from me to accuse Hollywood costumers of superficial or misguided historical research! \n\nSpeaking of which- [Bearskins](http://i.imgur.com/XYKUixT.jpg). This a somewhat tangential side note as its another aspect of the Film's uniforms which I remembered. Re-Watching scenes some couple of years down the line, they remained something of a mystery. After all, the famous Morier prints all depict Grenadiers in [Cloth-Fronted Mitres](http://www.nam.ac.uk/online-collection/images/960/103000-103999/103401.jpg). Indeed, the Mitre Cap is an almost essential part of the quintessential image of mid-18th Century British Armies, much as the Bearskin is for the army during the American Revolution. \n\nDistinctive bearskin Grenadier Caps appear on both the [35th's Grenadiers](http://i.imgur.com/XYKUixT.jpg) and members of the [60th](http://i.imgur.com/8pVe23P.jpg). The 30th Regiment of Foot wore Bearskin caps as early as 1755. The 42nd regiment wore them since their inception. And other regiments had adopted bearskins by the mid-1760's, possibly in imitation of the French Grenadiers.^1 To my knowledge, they still wore the cloth-fronted mitre cap as depicted in Morier's painting. Inspiration, again, must have sprung from somewhere. The white horse of Hanover on the front flap of the bearskin marks these as not just stock 1768-Pattern Grenadier Caps. The idea to put the Grenadiers in Bearskins about a decade too early could very well have come from Gerry Embleton's [depiction of a grenadier of the 60th](http://i.imgur.com/zBvG8bh.jpg) in the Osprey Title Wolfe's Army (first published in 1970). IIRC, a similar figure appears in the Embleton-illustrated *Military Dress of North America* (From 1973). \n\nAnd besides, the bearskins, aside from not being totally ahistorical, are pretty bitchin. \n\nI guess that's all for now- The moral of this story is that lace is important. Especially if you're the Colonel-In-Chief of an 18th century British regiment, desiring that the troops under your command present the utmost soldierly appearance. Getting your lace and facings confused with a regiment senior to yours in the line is, of course, frightful bad form. \n\nFor further Reading:\n\n* Michael Barthorp. *British Infantry Uniforms Since 1660*.\n\n* C.C.P.

Perhaps we even get wrapped up in the story, assuming its veracity, and parrot the bad history.\n\nWhat is this horror of which I speak? The narrative that minimizes the myriad of factors influencing Native American population dynamics after contact in favor of destruction from catastrophic, insurmountable waves of epidemic disease. Everyone knows 90% (or 95% or 99%) of Native Americans died from infectious diseases birthed in Eurasian herd animal domestication, constantly circulated and nurtured among susceptible Europeans in dirty farmstead hovels and cities, and unleashed on an innocent New World populace after contact. The narrative releases Europeans of blame for the destruction wrought by their arrival, and the naïve, innocent Amerindians naturally could not withstand the onslaught of a microbial tide. Thanks to disease, contact followed one sad, inevitable course of destruction as a New World paradise conveniently free of its original inhabitants welcomed the arrival of genetically superior hosts from across the sea. I blame [the book that shall not be named](http://books.google.com/books?id=PWnWRFEGoeUC&amp;dq=guns+germs+and+steel&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s).\n\nWhy is this bad history? First, the “virgin soil” metaphor follows an unfortunate tendency to view Native Americans as inexperienced, genetically weaker, and helpless to defend themselves against the European invaders. Second, the narrative requires a fundamental assumption that population dispersion, and community abandonment, in the protohistoric was a result of catastrophic mortality due to introduced infectious disease, and not a response to periodic resource scarcity or the natural ebbs and flows of power seen in the pre-contact Americas. Third, the narrative ignores the social and environmental ecology of the Americas in determining infectious disease spread. Finally, the narrative emphasizes disease at the expense of discussing the larger impacts of colonialism, many of which fueled pathogen spread, as well as increasing host susceptibility to the infectious agents. \n\nWhat follows is a refutation of the narrative based on the history of the U.S. Southeast. At the end I hope to demonstrate the spread of smallpox was limited in the protohistoric, but the combination of many factors related to the Indian slave trade combined to initiate and perpetuate the Great Southeast Smallpox Epidemic of 1696-1700.\n\n**Genetics, Immunology, and Infectious Disease**\n\nMany versions of the “virgin soil” narrative incorporate some degree of genetic determinism and inherent European superiority when explaining the mortality due to infectious disease across the New World. Briefly, the notion states that by pure lack of exposure to a wide variety of Old World pathogens Native Americans were predisposed to die from Old World diseases. There are several issues with this perspective. First, human immunology doesn’t work like that. Second, some Old World populations do have high frequencies of alleles conferring some protection against disease, but that disease is malaria and we don’t usually talk about *P. falciparum* when discussing catastrophic New World epidemics. Third, the New World pathogen load ensured Native Americans had exposure to a wide variety of infectious organisms and weren’t disease virgins living in a pathogen-free paradise.\n\nTo completely oversimplify a semester of human immunology, host defense against infectious disease is based on [innate immunity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-specific_immunity) (an immediate, non-specific response to non-self antigens with no “memory”) and [adaptive immunity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_immune_system) (a longer-acting, and longer-lived specific response to a specific antigen that confers resistance and “remembers” the pathogen). I know of no evidence of differences in innate immunity between populations from the Old and New World. As far as adaptive immunity, all humans, either from the New or Old World, are susceptible to infectious disease and once exposed all humans will either mount an immune response, survive, and develop some measure of immunity, or die. There is no Lamarckian safety in your dad surviving smallpox. There is no magic transferable immunity because the next village over lived through a smallpox epidemic, but you never encountered the virus. There is just acquired immunity, and in that sense a susceptible European has no inherent superiority to a susceptible Native American when smallpox comes knocking. \n\nWe might think 10,000 years of selection by periodic smallpox epidemics influenced allele frequencies, but, unlike malaria, there is no evidence of smallpox-specific alleles conferring protection in Old World populations. Our hominin ancestors lived with a more benign version of the *falciparum* parasite for tens of thousands of years before sedentary agriculturalists provided a reservoir of susceptible hosts and allowed for an adaptive radiation of a nasty strain of malaria ~10,000 years ago. Over 10,000 years multiple alleles in European, Asian, and African populations (HbC, HbE, thalassaemias, G6PD, ovalocytosis, Duffy antigen, etc.) show evidence of positive selective pressure, *possibly* linked to malaria selection. Links have been suggested between the plague and the delta 32 CCR5 allele, as well as the cystic fibrosis and cholera/typhoid/TB. However, aside from the alleles related to malaria there is no evidence that Europeans possessed some genetic superiority conferring resistance to infectious diseases from the Old World. Susceptible Old World populations died in high numbers once exposed to the virus. (True, Native American populations do display increased homogeneity at the HLA [(human leukocyte antigen)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_leukocyte_antigen) loci when compared to Old World populations, but we are far from understanding how, or even if, HLA diversity influences either the virulence of smallpox or the case fatality rate.)\n\nFinally, the “virgin soil” perspective on health before contact paints the New World as a disease free paradise that did nothing to prepare Native American immune systems for Old World epidemics. A wide variety of gastrointestinal parasites accompanied the original migrants on their journey to the New World and can be found in coprolites and mummies across the Americas (see Goncalves et al. 2003 for a [review of archaeoparasitology](http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S0074-02762003000900016&amp;script=sci_arttext)). New World populations were likewise subject to Chagas, pinta, bejel, tick-borne pathogens like Lyme disease and Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever, and likely syphilis and TB (though there is some debate on those two). Finally, like all humans who interact with wildlife, New World populations would have been subject to zoonotic diseases that jumped from a non-human animal to a human host. The most famous New World zoonotic disease from a wildlife source is [cocoliztli](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2730237/), presumed to be a viral hemorrhagic disease like Hantavirus, that killed millions in a series of epidemics that burned through Mexico in the late 16th century.\n\n**If a Protohistoric Southeastern Village is Abandoned Do We Automatically Blame Epidemics?**\n\nIn ~800 AD the Mississippian tradition emerged in the U.S. Southeast. Simple and paramount chiefdoms grew associated with large earthen mounds, supported by maize agriculture, and incorporating a distinct Southeastern Ceremonial Complex material culture. Mississippian culture spread and flourished for several hundred years before the eventual decline of many population centers, including the famous Cahokia complex, after 1400. By the time Columbus bumbled onto a new world many, but by no means all, mound sites had decreased in their power and influence. Various theories have been proposed for the decline of the Mississippian culture, ranging from increased warfare, resource exhaustion, climate change and drought. In the wake of chiefdom decline, a trend toward highly defensible independent towns begins to take shape.\n\nFor many scholars (or geographers/orinthologists writing outside their scope of knowledge) evidence of epidemics in the 16th century includes any abandoned site, any decline in village size, and any population dispersal event. Smallpox must have spread north from Mexico, and burned like wildfire through the region leaving abandoned villages and mounds of corpses in its wake. Diamond himself assumes 95% of the Native American population perished in these protohistoric plagues, and smallpox preceded de Soto’s 1539-1542 *entrada*. For perhaps the past half century this assumption seemed a stretched, but perhaps valid, interpretation of the data. However, as our knowledge of the period increases we must question this assumption for two reasons; (1) population dispersal is a common method of coping with resource scarcity or warfare throughout North America generally, and specifically in the context of Mississippian population dynamics, decentralization follows previously mentioned regional trends, (2) we lack concrete evidence of smallpox spreading into the interior. Ethnohistorical accounts of disease mortality events begin in the 17th century, but that evidence is absent in the 16th century record. \n\nFinally, implicit in the abandonment=disease portion of the “virgin soil” narrative is an assumption that major Southeastern chiefdoms, or population centers, could not long co-exist alongside European settlements due to disease transfer. The permanence of several chiefdoms, including the Natchez chiefdom which persisted until chronic warfare with the French caused their dispersal in 1730, reveals co-existence of larger population centers was possible even with continual contact with Europeans and their multitude of nasty pathogens. During the later mission period, Amerindian populations in New Mexico and Florida were both subject to periodic waves of infectious disease mortality when a pathogen was introduced to the community, followed by periods of relative calm when population size rebounded. When seen in the greater context of the turmoil and fragmentation surrounding the Mississippian decline, we must entertain that sites were abandoned in the protohistoric for a variety of reasons, not exclusively disease mortality.\n\n**Epidemics and the Social/Environmental Ecology of the Southeast**\n\nSmallpox requires face-to-face contact (6-7 feet distance for ~3 hours), or (less frequently) direct contact with infected body fluids/bedding/scabs to spread between hosts. For the first 7-14 days after exposure the host is not contagious, and shows no signs of infection. After this incubation period, flu-like symptoms begin, and macules, papules, and vesicles begin to form. For the next 10 days the host is highly contagious, deathly ill, and will either die or recover with immunity to the disease (see the [CDC smallpox page for more info](http://emergency.cdc.gov/agent/smallpox/overview/disease-facts.asp)). The virulence of the virus actually works against long-term propagation and the creation of an epidemic. On average, one smallpox carrier can only infect 5-6 other susceptible hosts (less than influenza, measles, and whooping cough), and during the most contagious period the host is too sick to travel widely. In the New World, sparsely inhabited land, or highly contested territory, between major settlements could effectively buffer populations from the spread of the virus if travel was restricted or the terrain too rough for an infected individual to cross during the incubation period.\n\nThe best evidence suggests smallpox arrived in the New World in 1518. The virus made landfall with Spanish ships and entered the disease load of indigenous populations in Hispaniola and Puerto Rico, before spreading to Cuba and on to Mexico with Cortez. From Mexico the virus spread south through Central America to South America in advance of conquistadores. The “virgin soil” narrative assumes smallpox made its way north, as it also spread south to the Inka heartland, Tawantinsuyu. In northern Mexico and the southern U.S., however, a zone of sparsely inhabited land separated the major population centers of Mexico and the U.S. Southeast. There is little evidence of thriving trade between the U.S. Southeast and Mexico, and Cabeza de Vaca described a land populated by foragers with low population densities during his wanderings in Texas, New Mexico and northern Mexico. Without evidence of consistent trade networks where the sick and the susceptible could flow north, or ethnographic accounts of the disease itself, the assumption that smallpox spread into the North American interior remains an assumption.\n\nIf not overland, could the virus have arrived on the Atlantic coast through legal *entradas*, illegal slaving raids, shipwrecked sailors, or Native American trade from the Caribbean? Possibly. Early Spanish attempts to settle and explore the North American read like a comedy of errors. Poor planning, execution, and interaction with local Native American populations ruined any hope of success as voyage after voyage succumbed to hunger, violence, and disease. In most instances, though, the disease mortality increased with time since landfall (and deteriorating overall conditions involving poor food supplies and hostilities both within the group and with Native Americans), and not during the key 7-14 day incubation period for smallpox. Again, the assumption that smallpox jumped to the mainland in the early 1500s remains an assumption. \n\nIf the virus did make landfall, though, would it spread inland? Due to easy access to trade from the Atlantic, the Guale, Timucua and Apalachee mission populations in Florida were subject to periodic epidemics of disease followed by years of relative stasis when populations rebounded. The Spanish zone of influence extended chiefly across northern Florida and southern Georgia (look, [a fun map](http://uwf.edu/jworth/spanfla_missions.jpg)) but they failed to establish long-term settlements deep into the interior. As previously mentioned, during the decline of the Mississippian sites a trend toward smaller defensible towns appears throughout the Southeast. Kelton, in *Epidemics and Enslavement: Biological Catastrophe in the Native Southeast, 1492-1715*, argues endemic warfare carved the southeast into polities, with vacant no-mans-lands separating larger communities.\n\n&gt; years of endemic warfare created contested spaces or buffer zones between rival polities where humans could not live, hunt, or travel safely… These areas or buffer zones served as a sanctuary for wild game… and sixteenth-century European accounts describe a social landscape that consisted of a maze of buffer zones isolating rival polities from one another\n\nThese contested spaces fragmented populations throughout Florida, even after the establishment of the mission system. While de Soto was rampaging like a dick throughout the Southeast from the Savannah to the Mississippi Rivers he encountered palisades villages and “deserts” with no human habitations on perfectly fertile land. These buffer zones between rival settlements could easily halt the progression of an epidemic before it spread to the next susceptible village. A shipwrecked, smallpox infested sailor (talk about rotten luck) could spark a localized epidemic along the coast, but the wave of disease would flare out as it moved to the fragmented interior.\n\n**Not by Smallpox Alone**\n\nIn the middle of the 17th century the U.S. Southeast began to change. The English, first operating out of Virginia and later increasing influence through the Carolinas, united the region into one large commercial system based on the trade in deer skins and human slaves. By linking the entire region with the Atlantic Coast, the English created the social and ecological changes needed to perpetuate smallpox epidemics into the interior of the continent. \n\nSlavery existed in the U.S. Southeast before contact, but the English traders transformed the practice to suit their insatiable greed, and perpetuated conflicts throughout the region for the sole purpose of increasing the flow of Indian slaves (operating under the doctrine that captives could be taken as slaves in a “just war”). Traders employed Native American allies, like the Savannah, to raid their neighbors for sale, and groups like the Kussoe who refused to raid were ruthlessly attacked. When the Westo, previously English allies who raided extensively for slaves, outlived their usefulness they were likewise enslaved. As English influence grew the choice of slave raid or be slaved extended raiding parties west across the Appalachians, and onto the Spanish mission doorsteps. Slavery became a tool of war, and the English attempts to rout the Spanish from Florida included enslaving their allied mission populations. Slaving raids nearly depopulated the Florida peninsula as refugees fled south in hopes of finding safe haven on ships bound for Spanish-controlled Cuba ([a good slave raiding map](http://uwf.edu/jworth/spanfla_retreat.jpg)). Gallay, in *Indian Slave Trade: The Rise of the English Empire in the American South, 1670-1717*, writes the drive to control Indian labor extended to every nook and cranny of the South, from Arkansas to the Carolinas and south to the Florida Keys in the period 1670-1715. More Indians were exported through Charles Town than Africans were imported during this period.\n\nOld alliances and feuds collapsed. Contested buffer zones disappeared. Refugees fled inland, crowding into palisaded towns deep in the interior of the continent. In response to the threat posed by English-backed slaving raids, previously autonomous towns began forming confederacies of convenience united on mutual defense. The Creek, Choctaw, Cherokee, and Chickasaw emerged as united confederacies in this period. The Creek, for example, were composed primarily of a Coosa, Cowets, Cuseeta and Abihka core, all Muscogulge people with related, but not mutually intelligible languages. Regardless of affiliation, attacks by slavers disrupted normal life. Hunting and harvesting outside the village defenses became deadly exercises and led to increased nutritional stress as famine depleted field stores and enemies burned growing crops. Displaced nations attempted to carve new territory inland, escalating violence as the shatterzone of English colonial enterprises spread across the region. Where the slavers raided, famine and warfare followed close behind.\n\nThe slave trade united the region in a commercial enterprise involving the long-range travel of human hosts, crowded susceptible hosts into dense palisaded villages, and weakened host immunity through the stresses of societal upheaval, famine, and warfare. All these factors combined to initiate and perpetuate the first verifiable wide-spread smallpox epidemic to engulf the U.S. Southeast from 1696-1700. By 1715, through the combined effect of slaving raids, displacement, warfare, famine, and introduced infectious diseases like smallpox “much of the Coastal Plain, the Piedmont, the Gulf Coast, and the Mississippi Valley had been widowed of its aboriginal population” (Kelton).\n\nSimply parroting 95% of Native Americans died in virgin soil epidemics oversimplifies the diverse factors influencing population dynamics in the Southeast, and the conditions needed to fuel a wide-spread epidemic. Hopefully, this post helps to show why the popular narrative is an overgeneralization, and the need to demand a better version of popular Native American history in the protohistoric period.\n\nEdits for formatting errors.",

        "text": "Ignaz Semmelweis [often turns up on reddit](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/search?q=Semmelweis&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all), so I've decided to make a post as a broad response to the reactions I see whenever his name pops up. Typically he is praised as a visionary and his contemporaries roundly condemned for their treatment of him. While there is some truth to this judgement, as always the reality was much more complex than lone wolf visionary vs established conservative institution. Much like in the Edison vs Tesla stuff, I am not arguing that Semmelweis doesn't deserve the praise he is given by us moderns, I'm trying to explain why he went unrecognised without simply calling his opponents evil. Here's a TL;DR if you want to use it as a reference next time you see Semmelweis turn up.\n\n**TL;DR What happened to Semmelweis was a tragedy, and undoubtedly a miscarriage of justice in medical science. But there were many reasons why this happened. Painting his opponents as cartoonish devils does nothing to aid our understanding of why Semmelweis was marginalised, and ignores the facts of the case. There were plenty of doctors who felt that they had good scientific reasons to dismiss Semmelweis' results.**\n\nI'll try to sum up the standard story, mostly culled from wikipedia as that's where people link to on reddit, then we can get to the exploration of why Semmelweis' ideas did not catch on:\n\n**The Standard Story**\n\nIgnaz Semmelweis was a Hungarian doctor who worked in Austria in the mid 19th century. In 1846 he became chief resident of the First Obstetrical Clinic in Vienna General Hospital. The Vienna General Hospital had two maternity clinics, the First and Second. The First clinic had a maternal mortality rate of 10% from Puerperal Fever, while the Second clinic's maternal mortality rate was much lower at 4%. This was widely known in Vienna, and women begged to be admitted to the Second rather than the First clinic. Puerperal fever was rare among women who gave birth on the streets.\n\nSemmelweis set out to discover why the First clinic's maternal mortality rate was so much higher than the Second's, and why street birth outperformed them both. For all intents and purposes, his work is a masterful example of the scientific method. He looked at every concievable difference between the two clinics. For example, in the first clinic priests would enter through the front and walk all the way through the clinic, waving incense as they went, to administer last rites to dying women, whereas in the second clinic they took a much shorter route. Semmelweis thought this might have a psychological effect on the women, so he made priests enter through the back of the first clinic. He found no change in mortality rates. There are a dozen more things he tried, some simple like climate control or the position of the mother during birth, others more convoluted like the priest example.\n\nEventually he achieved a breakthrough when his friend Jakob Kolletschka died of an infection resembling Puerperal Fever after being accidentally stabbed with a scalpel which had just been used in a post mortem examination. Semmelweis then noted that the First clinic was used for training medical students, whereas the Second clinic was used for training midwives. Medical students performed post mortems, whereas midwives did not. He concluded that the medical students were carrying tiny, invisible cadaverous particles on their hands after performing a post mortem which subsequently infected the mothers. He demanded that all students wash their hands with a chlorine solution after they had attended an autopsy.  The mortality rate in the First clinic immediately dropped by a factor of 10, with 0 deaths recorded in 2 out of the first 12 months of this practice.\n\nSemmelweis tried to promulgate his views throughout Europe, but with very little success. His ideas were considered extreme and he was dismissed from Vienna General Hospital after being swept up in the revolutions of 1848 (in which he was not a participant, but he was Hungarian so he got hit by the fallout). He was unable to find another job in Vienna, and returned to Pest in 1850. He became head of a small clinic in Pest and virtually eliminated Puerperal Fever. He continued to encounter resistance to his ideas even among his fellow Hungarians. He wrote two essays in the late 1850s before publishing a book, \"The Etiology, Concept and Prophylaxis of Childbed Fever\" in 1861.\n\nHowever, by 1860, Semmelweis' mental health had begun to deteriorate. He suffered from bouts of depression which by the middle of the decade had caused major disruptions to his personal and professional life. He drank heavily and apparently was often seen in the company of prostitutes in public. His wife and colleagues had him committed to an asylum in 1865, where he was severely beaten by guards and died of an infection just 2 weeks after he was committed. He was 47.\n\n**Why were Semmelweis' Ideas Dismissed?**\n\nThere were two major reasons why Semmelweis' highly encouraging results did not translate into the adoption of his ideas. The first is that Semmelweis' ideas conflicted with very strongly held concepts about what disease is and how it works, and the second was that Semmelweis himself was a very difficult man, and by his actions he shot himself in the foot.\n\nThis quote comes from a review of \"The Doctor's Plague: Germs, Childbed Fever, and the Strange Story of Ignaz Semmelweis\" by Sherwin B. Nuland. The review was written by Irvine Loudon.\n\n&gt;That Semmelweis made some brilliant observations in 1847 on the manner in which puerperal fever is transmitted is beyond doubt. But he was his own worst enemy. His dogmatism, arrogance, hostility, and unforgivable rudeness to colleagues who dared to question his views, combined with his failure to publish his findings for 14 years, damaged his reputation... There is broad agreement within the small group of historians who have studied Semmelweis since the 1970s that he possessed a complex and difficult character and about how his reputation rose from oblivion to fame. \n\nSemmelweis' findings were mostly published by his students between his discovery of them and the late 1850s. The results they documented were heralded by some as very important, Ferdinand von Hebra said that they were the most important discovery since cowpox inoculations to stop smallpox. However the papers published by Semmelweis' students often contained errors, or had confused theoretical ideas. As such, the results were misunderstood by some. In Britain in particular there was widespread misunderstanding of Semmelweis' work. A number British doctors thought Semmelweis was simply restating the results of Oliver Wendell Holmes who had argued earlier in the 1840s that Puerperal fever was contagious.\n\nIn fact, Semmelweis was arguing for quite a radically new concept of disease, which is one of the reasons why he was misunderstood. Firstly, he said that all cases of Puerperal fever were caused by a single source; cadaverous particles. This was at odds with the contemporary concept of disease which put emphasis on the particular circumstances of the patient's body to explain the incidence and particular manifestation of disease. The idea that all Puerperal fever comes from a single source, cadaverous material, conflicted with the prevailing view that all illness is a highly complicated thing which did not have just one explanation.\n\nWith this worldview, many of Semmelweis' pieces of evidence become uncertain. For example, contrary to what Semmelweis argued, according to medical understanding at the time, Dr Kolletschka could not have died from Puerperal fever because Puerperal fever is a disease for new mothers. In the minds of contemporary doctors, it didn't even make sense to say that Kolletschka died of Puerperal fever, he could not get that disease by its very definition.\n\nFurther, doctors *did* wash their hands with soap after returning from the morgue until they were visibly clean. It is not difficult to see that, for a doctor working before the discovery of microbes, the idea that invisible particles could cause disease seemed slightly far fetched. Not so far fetched that it didn't require a response, but far fetched enough that one would need to give a theoretical explanation and mechanism for how this occurred. Semmelweis did not offer one. In addition, the incidence of Puerperal fever was much lower in England than it was on the Continent, and there Semmelweis' ideas were seen not to be necessary.\n\nOne of the most prominent anti-Semmelweis doctors was a Dane by the name of Carl Edvard Marius Levy, who published a response to Semmelweis in 1848. I won't go through it because it is long and somewhat technical, but suffice to say that Dr Levy felt he had very good, well grounded scientific reasons to dismiss Semmelweis' claims. For example, he says that if Semmelweis was correct and infection spreads as easily if he said it did, then the inequality of mortality between the two clinics would be much lower than it was before Semmelweis started his work. Indeed, with the prevailing medical worldview, Levy's criticisms made a lot of sense and indirectly exposed the fact that Semmelweis was actually proposing something quite revolutionary.\n\nFinally we come to Semmelweis' response, his 1861 book \"The Etiology, Concept and Prophylaxis of Childbed Fever\". This was Semmelweis' last chance to get his ideas accepted throughout Europe, as by the 1860s his ideas were considered to have been effectively refuted and people had stopped adopting them. Had he written a 150 page book outlining his results, their consequences, and responding to scientific criticisms of his work, the day may have been saved.\n\nInstead, \"The Etiology, Concept and Prophylaxis of Childbed Fever\" was a 500 page book full of bitterness and vitriol, blasting those doctors who had refused to accept his ideas, painting himself as a tortured genius who had been cruelly crushed by the evil establishment. Again, there was some truth to this; he *had* been unfairly persecuted in Vienna because he was Hungarian, and his opponents *had* dismissed his ideas without trying them out. But alienating your entire audience by calling them idiots is obviously not the way to get your ideas accepted.  Semmelweis' deteriorating mental health probably had an impact on the contents of his book.\n\n**In Defense of Semmelweis**\n\nWhile this post has been an apologetic for Semmelweis' opponents, I want to make it clear that Semmelweis and his results were mistreated even by the standards of the day. Even his fiercest critics admitted that the mortality statistics from his time in Vienna were impressive, even as they tried to pass them off as the result of chance. That they did not follow up on these statistics and conduct their own trials was a scientific mortal sin. Had Semmelweis had the support of the Vienna hospital, he likely would have continued to produce outstanding results and his arguments would have become progressively more difficult to dismiss, even with their lack of theoretical basis. As it happened, Semmelweis' personal traits as well as the turbulent times interfered, and he was sent back to relative obscurity.\n\nThe take away message from the tale of Semmelweis' is that there's two sides to every story, and that politics is often as important in science as evidence is. *Yes* Semmelweis was mistreated, but that does not make his opponents monsters. Perhaps instead this story can be an allegory for scientists, showing how easily theoretical considerations lead smart, well intentioned men astray.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nCarter, K.

(Now I'm hungry.)\n\nFirst, /u/Northmost responds to the 5-50 million range with the following:\n\n&gt;These figures are absolute nonsense that would place the scattered hunter-gatherer populations of North America at higher than contemporary Europe. Most sensible non-politicized pre-Colombian population estimates of North America are in the 1-2 million range.\n\nSomeone then gives an estimate of 50-100 million (which is rather high), and he responds:\n\n&gt;So almost twice that of Europe in 1500, despite vastly inferior levels of agriculture and general infrastructure?\n\nTwo problems here so far:\n\n1. I have never seen an estimate from any scholars that dips below an estimated two million.\n\n2. 'Vastly inferior levels of agriculture'? By what measure (with due consideration given to different methods being developed for different environments/crops/types of agriculture)? This sentence is just nonsense. And 'general infrastructure'? Again, that's not quantifiable, and meaningless as well given that societies adopt technology, generally, according to needs as well as availability of materials, etc. (all of this after the circumstances of the innovation). I'm also going to guess that this person would dismiss at the wave of a hand any citation of agriculture/infrastructure of Mayan, Inkan, or Aztec origin.\n\nIn response to the second comment, someone then says:\n\n&gt;Most of the natives were wiped out by disease before they ever laid eyes on a European. The spread of European disease outpaced the European explorers themselves through intertribal coughing, sex, sneezing, contact, trade, tec etc\n\nThis is an incomplete viewpoint. I'll quote my response from that thread:\n\n&gt;Disease accounted for an enormous majority of initial deaths, but the continuing decline of these populations requires that one focus on the systematic destruction of their societies on the part of the European settlers. I take the following from David Stannard's *American Holocaust:*\n\n&gt;&gt;The European habit of indiscriminately killing women and children when engaged in hostilities with the natives of the Americas was more than an atrocity. It was flatly and intentionally genocidal. For no population can survive if its women and children are destroyed.\n\n&gt;&gt;*[An examination of European and Japanese population growth during the WWI and WWII periods, respectively]*\n\n&gt;&gt;The reason these populations were able to increase, despite massive military damage, was that a greatly disproportionate ratio of men to women and children was being killed. This, however, was not what happened to the indigenous people in the Caribbean, in Mesoamerica, in South America, or in what are now the United States and Canada during the European assault against them Neither was this slaughter of innocents anything by intentional in design, nor did it end with the close of the colonial era.\n\n&gt;Portraying disease as the real culprit here is a very incomplete view of what happened.\n\nQuote shamelessly stolen from /u/400-rabbits from [this thread.](http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/1q7074/precolumbian_archaeology_really_were_all_just/)\n\n/u/Northmost then says this, when provided with two sources:\n\n&gt;Wikipedia has long since been flooded by SJWs and is worthless as a source. These insanely inflated figures are nothing more than an attempt to turn a displacement into a genocide.\n\n&gt;The truth is there are more Native Americans alive today than at any point in history.\n\nThis is also bullshit. He dismisses the sources, which do cite scholarship, without providing any counter-evidence. Again, quoting my response (in part shamefully plagiarized from the linked post from /u/snickeringshadow above):\n\n&gt;The lowest estimates I've seen from pre-Columbian archaeologists (and other scholars)^1 still exceed two million. The systematic research on this topic really began around the 1970s-1980s, the numbers of which vastly exceed those conducted prior (when, for example, the focus on stone structures in Mesoamerica overshadowed any inquiries into the true nature of the Maya's vibrant urban centers, concluding instead that they were uninhabited centers for events of religious significance). There's also the problem of earlier studies being conducted by experts in a certain pre-Columbian culture, who notoriously overstated the extent of their culture at the expense of others, like the Mayanist Michael Coe is said to have done in his work *The Maya* (1966).\n\n&gt;Of course, I don't expect this to be of any effect on your thinking, as you're pretty set on the \"SJW's are just making this shit up\" nonsense.\n\n&gt;1. I prefer to get my sources in academic publications or [from] qualified persons, not anonymous folks on the internet writing mini-polemics without citing any evidence.\n\n----\n\nEdit - And let's not get submitted to /r/badlinguistics for my use of the non-literal definition of 'decimated'.\n\n-----\n\nEdit the second - [\"That's what happens when one side of a conflict is thousands of years more advanced than the other...The civilizations, if you can call them that, that existed in North America at the time of colonization were stuck in the stone age. Compared to the Europeans that conquered them, they were thousands of years behind. The lands they inhabited were wasted on what was essentially a dead branch on the human tree.\"](http://np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/2blk2g/til_that_in_1763_a_vigilante_group_the_paxton/cj6wr83)",

Especially when I'm drunk.\n\nBut like all pop history the Rap Battles have their own problems, and I thought the recent end of the third season makes for a good time to gather up them up and nitpick like nits have never before been picked. Since I'm not an expert on every single character that takes the mic, I thought it might be fun to do this more collaboratively - I'll lay the groundwork with a bigger post and edit in people's comments as they come in. Since each season has 12-18 videos I decided to tackle this season by season, and so we'll start with [season 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HZ5V9rT96M&amp;list=PLQ-7WiWmOuK9kZYOD9Z8MhZK-0Fv6T3c5). I'm leaving out the videos that I didn't spot any immediate badhistory in, but let me know if there's any that need to be added.\n\nAnd so, without further ado...\n\n***\n\n**[DARTH VADER! VERSUS! ADOLF HITLEEEEER!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpqNvskS_kM)**\n\nLeaving aside that Stephen Hawking does not seem like a particularly natural ally for Adolf Hitler, Darth Vader manages to screw up quite a few details about his opponent, starting with a minor chronological issue:\n\n*\"You wrote a little book/Got 'em fired up/Had a beer hall putsch/Got 'em fired up/When your bunker started getting fired up/You put a gun in your mouth and fired up!\"*\n\n*Mein Kampf* was actually written while Hitler was imprisoned as a result of the Beer Hall Putsch, and not before. I would hazard an unsourced guess that Hitler's infamy as a result of the putsch were part of why the book sold so well initially, but I'm not sure of that.\n\nNext up is our good friend General Winter:\n\n*\"You dumb motherfucker, didn't Napoleon let you know?/When you conquer Russia better pack some fucking winter clothes!\"*\n\n~~For some reason we don't have anything in our wiki regarding this myth, which surprised me. We have a lot of threads where people quickly dismiss it, but I can't seem to find anybody tackling it in depth, either here or on /r/AskHistorians. So if somebody remembers something let me know.~~\n\n~~Either way, the main problem with the idea that it was Russian Winter that defeated the Germans was that Barbarossa began in late June - the 22nd, in fact - and although there were quite a few casualties due to weather, it's hard to point to that as the sole cause for the failure of the invasion. Yes, German troops were poorly supplied, largely due to overoptimism about the outcome and speed of the campaign, but the defeat on the Eastern front had much more to do with the General Zhukov than General Winter. Also worth noting is that it was Russian spring, with its swampy mud roads, that caused a larger logistical problem for the Wehrmacht, as it caused several problems with their vehicles.~~\n\n~~Now, somebody please write up a better version of that, and an inclusion of Napoleon would be nice too. My explanation isn't nearly good enough.~~\n\n/u/facepoundr has shown me to be a fool with his post that I shall copy here:\n\n&gt;I find your lack of knowledge disturbing. \n\n&gt;A Long Time Ago, in a ~~Galaxy~~ Russia far far away, there was such a thing as General Winter. It battled down upon the Wehrmacht forces and caused deaths in the thousands. See, the plan for Operation Barbarossa was to set the war in the summer months and have things wrapped up by the end of fall before the winter would set in. Hitler compared the Soviet Union to a rickety shack and said with one swift kick it could be brought down. He and his commanders thought they could bring it down with a swift kick of Operation Barbarossa, however they underestimated the resistance given by the Soviet forces, but also overestimated their capabilities to reach Moscow in time before winter set in. This coupled with some delays in the initial launch of the campaign allowed for Ol' General Winter, veteran of many Wars, to rise from his slumber and bring his weapons to bear upon the invading army. \n\n&gt;For example, the Encyclopedia Britannica is quoted as saying:\n\n&gt;&gt;On December 2 a further effort was launched, and some German detachments penetrated into the suburbs of Moscow; but the advance as a whole was held up in the forests covering the capital. The stemming of this last phase of the great German offensive was partly due to the effects of the Russian winter, whose subzero temperatures were the most severe in several decades. In October and November a wave of frostbite cases had decimated the ill-clad German troops, for whom provisions of winter clothing had not been made, while the icy cold paralyzed the Germans’ mechanized transport, tanks, artillery, and aircraft. The Soviets, by contrast, were well clad and tended to fight more effectively in winter than did the Germans. By this time German casualties had mounted to levels that were unheard of in the campaigns against France and the Balkans; by November the Germans had suffered about 730,000 casualties.\n\n&gt;Also the CIA World Fact Book also attributes General Winter in the success of the Soviet Counter Offensive at Moscow by saying: \n\n&gt;&gt;In December 1941, after General Winter had pinched out Hitler's spectacular six-month Russian onslaught just short of its objectives-Leningrad, Moscow, and the Donetz basin\n\n&gt;Furthermore, to add in some delicious Primary Sources to really help round this out, Joseph Goebbels on behalf of Adolf Hitler on December 20th, 1941 made a plea for the German people to provide warm clothes for the soldiers fighting on the front. \n\n&gt;This is of course ignoring other problems Germans faced by Ol' General Winter. Such as not being able to use certain equipment during the cold, such as tanks and certain aircraft, especially with a dwindling supply problem. \n\n&gt;Darth Vader was right, Hitler should have packed some fucking winter clothes, but he didn't. Because he and his commanders believed they wouldn't need them. The belief in not needing Winter clothes cost the Germany Army thousands of men and hundred of thousands cases of frostbite in the first year of battle alone. That is ignoring the problems that the 6th Army faced later on in Stalingrad in 1942-1943 when they still did not have adequate Winter clothing for the battle. \n\n&gt;The problem, or rather, the essence of why it can delve *into* bad history is the significance of it all. The Bad History Sarlacc rears its head when, for example, General Winter is attributed with the victories Russia won. Russia won through the blood and sweat of all those who served in the Red Army. To say that the Soviet Union *won* simply because of General Winter is bad history. It detracts from the sacrifices made by the Russians. However, General Winter was a factor, and Hitler did forget to pack his Winter clothes for his army. Darth Vader, knowing directly the importance of having the right gear for the job (Snow Troopers for Hoth), was right to criticize Hitler for not being prepared for Winter that was coming. Even if Hitler thought the war was going to end beforehand. \n\n/u/Ilitarist breaks down the Napoleon reference:\n\n&gt;About Napoleon's General Winter problems. The short version of the war: Napoleon thinks he just punches Russians with greatest army ever and they understand the error of their ways, Russians evade decisive battles and let N. capture Smolensk. N. wonders if he should just sit there or to go for Moscow. In the end he goes for Moscow and captures it but Russians don't care. Supplying army so far in Russia is logistical hell so he decides to go back to Smolensk. Smolensk is not so good too so he goes further back. Russian army follows him up to the Paris.\n\n&gt;This myth comes from, unsurprisingly, Napoleon. It's also was a good trope at the time for Russians (God with us so even weather helps us or something). In his usual manner Napoleon in his memoirs explains that he did nothing wrong and it's everyone's fault including General Winter. When you read this war description you too don't see any point where Russians did something clever: there were very big battles (most famous is Borodino) but nobody had decisive victory. But series of poking \"draws\" like this destroyed supply lines of the Great Army, discouraged its allies (half of the army where allied troops from Germany and elsewhere who didn't really want to fight). There are also diplomatical mistakes of Napoleon (or Russian diplomatic victories) as he expected Sweden (Swedish king at the time was Napoleon's ex-subordinate) and Ottomans to attack Russia too. Napoleon hadn't used Russian internal problems (serf rebellions, nationalists).\n\n&gt;So as my sources (2012 was a big year in Russian media to launch various documentaries and podcasts about it) say, 1812 was mainly a Napoleon's failure, secondly Russian strategic victory and thirdly winter/terrain and clever use of it by the Russians. In any case, Russians do not have some inherit cold resistance, they had similar uniform so winter has just amplified Napoleon's supply fuck up.\n\n[Further watching here.](http://www.lse.ac.uk/newsAndMedia/videoAndAudio/channels/publicLecturesAndEvents/player.aspx?id=433)\n\n***\n\n**[AL CAPONE! VERSUS! BLACKBEEEAAARD!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yf9gulYfUh4)**\n\nI don't know anything about either of these characters, but I do want to point out that *al dente* really isn't that hard. It's kind of chewy at best.\n\n/u/isathrowawah points out that Al Capone only had one kid, so he's technically incorrect when he says that \"my kid*s* dress up like you for Halloween.\" Plus, the practice of children dressing up and asking for candy is only first referenced in Chicago in 1920, so Sonny Capone, at 2 years old, would have been right on the cutting edge of pumpkin-based festivities. Also of note is that at 0:47 in the video, Capone demonstrates a hand gesture considered offensive in the US, whereby he brushes the underside of his neck in a forward motion. Apparently, [this sign is not present in southern Italy, nor would it be offensive](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/picturegalleries/8788932/Rude-hand-gestures-of-the-world.html), and from that and its place of origin would probably not have spread to the second-generation immigrant Capone.\n\n/u/Quouar also notes that Blackbeard had more of an association with North Carolina rather than South Carolina.\n\n***\n\n**[JOAN OF ARC! VERSUS! MIIILEEEY CYRUUUSSS!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQx1sqPHTrk)**\n\n~~I'd love for someone to comment on Joan of Arc's armour, since I don't know anything about the stuff. It seems to match up pretty well [with a Google Images search of Joan of Arc](https://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&amp;authuser=0&amp;site=imghp&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=hp&amp;biw=1357&amp;bih=783&amp;q=Jeanne+D%27arc&amp;oq=Jeanne+D%27arc&amp;gs_l=img.3..0l10.553.2142.0.2330.12.11.0.0.0.0.297.1200.0j1j4.5.0....0...1ac.1.49.img..7.5.1199.7n4L0l6Ra5U), which is hardly surprising, but I don't know how accurate those images are themselves.~~\n\n/u/Enleat points out that, besides the style of armour being completely wrong (see examples of correct armour, and further discussion, [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2bhqvm/rbadhistory_versus_the_epic_rap_batles_of/cj5hz9v)), Joan of Arc isn't wearing a lot *underneath* the armour, which would be dangerous and uncomfortable. She should be wearing a [gambeson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambeson) and a padded cap, as illustrated in the linked post.\n\nSimilarly, considering how much ass this woman kicked, I have trouble believing that the voices of the angels were telling her to \"turn the other cheek.\"\n\n***\n\n**[MICHAEL JORDAN! VERSUS! MUHAMMAD ALIIII!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_uOtAkEf6U)**\n\nI don't have anything to say about this historically, just that Muhammad Ali automatically loses for ripping on *Space Jam*.\n\n/u/lesshatefulbullshit also points out that Muhammed Ali was a conscientious objector whose rejected application was supported by the Supreme Court, not a draft dodger.\n\n***\n\n**[BILL NYE! VERSUS! SIIR ISAAAC NEEWWTOON!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yis7GzlXNM)**\n\nNot strictly speaking bad history, but Isaac Newton spits a line at Bill Nye that is probably incorrect:\n\n*Well I conclude that your methods are the whackest/You wouldn't even pass in one of my classes!*\n\nGiven the degree to which the scientific method had advanced since Newton's time I can't help but think that it would in fact be the other way around, with Newton failing Bill Nye's class.\n\n~~Plus...how do you calculate the weight of a shadow?~~ Apparently [you can weigh a shadow.](http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2bhqvm/rbadhistory_versus_the_epic_rap_batles_of/cj5iadn) Anybody want to crunch the numbers on the one cast by Newton's mind?\n\nFurther \"not quite bad history,\" but /u/bohknows [points out that the answer to Newton's equation is not exclusively i](http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2bhqvm/rbadhistory_versus_the_epic_rap_batles_of/cj5kcxw). There's a bunch of numbers and letters in weird combinations involved that I don't understand, so just click through to the post.\n\n***\n\n**[GEORGE! WASHINGTON! VERSUS! WILLIIAAM WAALLAACE!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dl7CLaZFG1c)**\n\nThis is probably the juiciest piece of bad history, since William Wallace is largely ripped from *Braveheart* here, with his backwards kilt and his 900-years-out-of-fashion woad makeup, and *Braveheart* is a veritable cornucopia of bad history, as can be found described [in numerous websites](http://web.archive.org/web/20131009105036/http://medievalscotland.org:80/scotbiblio/bravehearterrors.shtml) that people are welcome to share.\n\nContrary to nicepeter's claim in the Behind the Scenes, /u/smileyman notes that Washington's dentures were in fact made of ivory and wire. You can find more information on them [here.](http://www.mountvernon.org/educational-resources/encyclopedia/false-teeth)\n\nHe goes on to point out some major issues with Washington's line:\n\n&gt;*Roll up in a boat./You're sleeping cut your throat./I watch the blood flow./Now who's got that red coat?*\n\n&gt;Honestly this is a *fantastic* rap line. However, the history is awful. Presumably this refers to the Battle of Trenton. \n\n&gt;*I roll up in a boat*\n\n&gt;If we're being technical, Washington didn't actually roll up in a boat--he crossed on a ferry with some of the horses and artillery. \n\n&gt;*You're sleeping cut your throat*\n\n&gt;He certainly didn't attack the Hessians while they were sleeping. They weren't even on the right side of the Delaware River until the early morning. They started marching towards Trenton at 4:00 am. The battle began about 8:00 am. The plan was a coordinated attack from opposites sides of the town. The men under Nathanael Greene launched their attack at 8:05 AM, Washington's men at 8:00 AM (which is pretty good timing considering the time period and conditions).\n\n&gt;*Now who's got that red coat?*\n\n&gt;Certainly not the men he was attacking. They were Hessians, not British regulars. They would have looked something like [this](http://www.bbwhite.com/Images/CallToDuty.jpg). Oh and for the record,  the Hessians weren't drunk from partying all night either--there's not a single contemporary source which makes that claim. The closest is a journal entry of one of the American officers from the night *before* the attack, where he speculates that the American forces will have an easy time of it because the Hessians loved to celebrate Christmas and would be drunk or asleep during the attack.\n\n\n\n***\n\n**[DONATELLO! MICHELANGELO! LEONARDO! RAPHAEL! VERSUS! LEONARDO! MICHELANGELO! DONATELLO! AND RAPHAEL!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HZ5V9rT96M)**\n\nLeonardo is remarkably forward with his sexuality, /u/Drosslemeyer points out, when he claims that loves the ladies. Unlike Raphael there was little evidence of him having relations with anybody and he brings up celibacy in his writings. There are theories that he was a homosexual, like a lot of historical figures, and, according to /u/Historyguy1, he thought the female reproductive system was \"super icky.\"\n\n***\n\nSo that's the worst I could find. Obviously a little skeletal, so I'm hoping that people add more. I know people were itching to tackle stuff like William Wallace, so I'm expecting to be doing a lot of editing here.\n\nEDIT1: Updated! I quoted the posts people made more effort on and reworded the smaller ones. Hopefully not a problem - let me know.\n\nEDIT2: Updated again! Just cleaning up a few things.",

        "text": "So, African history. It’s difficult to find someone interested in examining the history of an African state, culture, or region for its own sake. It’s most often brought up as ammunition for barraging at any number of modern political issues. This inevitably means there’s a spillover onto content in AskHistorians dealing with this topic, and it notably affects the kind of questions that are asked in the first place regarding Africa. However, we have Africa-related experts, though not nearly as much as we’d like, and we’ve slowly built up a body of literature (for want of a better word) on the subject. Much of that body of literature, along with an increasingly large counterpart in BadHistory, has been responding to questions about Africa’s lack of ‘civilizations’ or lack of ‘development’. It is to that subject that I want to turn today.\n\nAskHistorians was invoked by name by someone on Reddit. Specifically, it was mentioned as somewhere which doesn’t tolerate poorly sourced answers. However, in this particular dialogue our protagonist of the day was not to be dissuaded, and pronounced the following ([also viewable in context via this np-ified link](http://np.reddit.com/r/Documentaries/comments/2bbysz/when_god_was_a_girl_women_and_religion_2012_a_bbc/cj40j00)).\n\n&gt; That subreddit actively suppresses accurate views of history for political purposes. Just look at their section on Africa in their sidebar. People will ask why Africa never had any advanced civilizations like other continents (referring to Sub-Saharan Africa) and they'll completely sweep aside the argument, call you racist, and then focus only on North Africa and Nubia (an Egyptian colony) for ancient history and then jump to the medieval period ignoring everything inbetween while conveniently stepping aside 10,00 years of history in Sub-Saharan Africa where they were completely tribal having never developed simple technology like the wheel even in flat areas.\n \nI moderate AskHistorians, and have done for quite some time now (it’s getting close to two years). However, I’m not here to defend AskHistorians. I figure that’s something that doesn’t really need a large post to do, for a start. Instead I’m going to deconstruct the more basic underlying assumptions, to join BadHistory’s body of literature designed to confront all questions regarding Africa’s apparent lack of ‘development’.\n\n* Ancient Africa outside of North Africa was completely ‘tribal’.\n* Ancient Africa outside of North Africa developed no complex technologies.\n* Historians (be they posters on AskHistorians and elsewhere) are not capable of referring to any complex societies in Ancient Africa outside of North Africa.\n* Sub-Saharan Africa is the continent, North Africa doesn’t count.\n* Medieval Africa is cheating.\n \nAltogether, this may take some time. \n\nBefore I begin, I’m going to clarify some of my terms. Our protagonist did not decide to specify what exactly Sub-Saharan Africa means. It’s a notoriously flexible word, much like Middle East. From context it could be assumed they meant ‘all of Africa outside of North Africa’, ‘Equatorial Africa’, or ‘the parts of Africa where black Africans live’. All of these possibilities partially overlap, but on balance I suspect it’s the first that our protagonist means. My answer won’t be harmed by the other two being the case in any respect. \n\nIn addition, I’d like to specify that what I am not is an Africanist. My historical focus is not on Africa, and if this post at all makes people forget about AskHistorians’/BadHistory’s resident Africanists then it’s partially failed. I have what I’d call solid familiarity with some specific parts of Africa’s history, most particularly that of Carthage, pre-Islamic Egypt, and the ancient Red Sea coast. That’s quite a tiny drop in the vast,  warming, and verdant seas of African history. But I don’t feel that I’m at a disadvantage in that regard, because there is no such thing as an expert on all of African history. Africa as a continent is absolutely enormous. It makes as much sense to collate all of its history in a single ‘African history’ subject as it would to do the same with Asia. In addition, much of what I am here to point out is basic facts and existences, not analysis. So long as I have familiarity with archaeology and can read, I have material with which to counter all three of the major assertions.\n\nWe also have one final obstacle in terms of terminology, and that’s where the ‘medieval’ word is invoked. What ‘middle’ is being referred to here exactly? ‘Medieval’ is just ‘middle age/era’ in Latin, so what’s the Middle for Africa? The most generous response is that we include all periods considered contemporaneous with Medieval Europe as is generally defined. The end of the Classical era and the end of the Medieval era are both very slippery in terms of dates, as these periodisations are made in hindsight and rarely does ‘the so and so era’ coincide with a specific event that society would have recognised as world-altering. However, among accepted beginning-end dates the most generous is probably c553-1492 AD, and the least generous is 632-1453 AD. Since our protagonist is talking about ‘ancient’ stuff as the only area of interest, the most generous date is actually the least generous to our task, so I am going to do with that as our end to ‘ancient’ Africa- 553 AD.\n\nSo, our first claim is that Ancient Africa outside of North Africa was entirely ‘tribal’. In this context we’ll take this to mean no complex settled societies, which is still an arbitrary definition of ‘tribe’ (a notoriously useless word which /u/khosikulu and others have spent a long time deconstructing) but one that most resembles the intent of the original protagonist. My first and most immediate counter to this comes from East Africa, with the twin states of D’mt and Aksum (which share territory with the modern states of Ethiopia and Eritrea and Djibouti). The exact relationship between these two states is somewhat poorly understood, but the most important salient details are that one postdates the other- D’mt dates c. 10th century BC- 5th century BC, to my understanding, and Aksum from c.1st century AD-940 AD. Aksum trails out of our acceptable period, but it begins substantially earlier so it’s allowed. Nubia was disallowed by our protagonist, and presumably by a number of others, due to a heavy Egyptian influence in its earliest stages as an observable state (deconstruction of that due later on). But even if we accepted Nubia being rejected as a witness, I present instead both of these states as examples of states that were not direct territorial possessions of ancient Egypt in any period, and which nonetheless developed complex, urban societies. They were not states in splendid isolation- Aksum, being the far better documented society, was famous to its Mediterranean contemporaries as a major trading power in the Red Sea and in the Indian Ocean axis of trading networks as a whole. But what we are not arguing is that these two cultures represents colonies of another known complex society in that same era. And unless we are to exclude every Mediterranean state we can observe in the Bronze Age as being examples of complex societies because of their intense trade relationships with external states, there is no real argument that trade contacts equals either of these states being somehow ‘un-African’. Aksum continued to have an important role to play for much of its remaining history, being a very early state to convert to Christianity (traditionally dated to 325-328 AD), and also conquering significant territory in the South of Arabia. But I suppose even these well established examples might be rejected as not being Sub-saharan enough, or having too close a proximity to the Mediterranean (which is over a thousand miles away from Aksum).\n\nThen for additional examples how about the society generally termed as the Sao, or the Sao civilization, which happened to be located even further away from the Mediterranean, in the south of what is now Chad. The cities of this society are generally dated from the 6th century BC onwards. I am fairly certain that the definition of ‘tribal’ that our protagonist utilised (along with many others) does not align with the idea of being living in cities. How about the Nok culture who inhabited part of modern Nigeria, which at minimum possessed communities capable of producing iron in the 6th century BC. What about the people who inhabited the site of Jenne-Jeno in the Niger Delta, which first dates as a site to the 1st millenium BC, and which by the 3rd century AD covered 25 hectares, and which relied on its riverine position to provide for the resources it was too large to produce for itself? What about Dhar Tichitt in modern Mauritania, the oldest urban site known in West Africa (at present), inhabited from c.2000 BC-800 BC? What about the ancient kingdom of Ghana (confusingly not located within modern Ghana), more accurately known as Wagadugu, which existed in modern Mali/Mauritania and predated the Islamic merchants and armies that moved into the area? Now, it’s possible that by ‘tribal’ many people also imagine hunter-gatherer lifestyles or those of pure pastoralists, precluding even a settled lifestyle and extensive agriculture. If our protagonist had intended this, they might be surprised to find that evidence of extensive agricultural behaviour exists for very ancient African societies, to the point where agriculture was independently developed in Africa in what might be as many as four separate locations; agriculture did not reach the majority of Africa by diffusion from the Fertile crescent, to say the least. By contrast, no European society to our knowledge has currently been credited with the independent discovery of agriculture. At the most conservative estimates there is clear evidence for extensive farming practices and animal domestication across Africa by the 6th millenium BC.\n\nSo, we are then further confronted with our protagonist’s claim that not-North Africa did nothing for around 10,000 years, and invented no technologies, or indeed simple technologies. I assume, perhaps generously, that this refers to periods of time prior to the end of our ‘ancient’ period. I would cite the earlier invention of agriculture in multiple unrelated locations, but I suspect that this would be declared as ‘utterly basic’. I would cite that there is clear indication of pottery use by c.9000 BC at the latest, and that Cyprus’ prehistoric cultures only seem to have adopted ceramics in c.4500 BC, but I similarly have a nagging suspicion that ceramics too would be written off as so basic every human culture should have developed it, even the ‘backwards’ ones. However, there is far more to respond to this assertion with than pointing at sorghum and wavy-line pottery. One is a specific one to our particular protagonist, who asserts that the wheel is a basic technology. I will have to be generous here and assume that they don’t mean wheel shaped objects, but something that is used in combination with other things as an actual method of assisted locomotion (wheels can move without assistance, but surprisingly rarely is this accomplishing much that’s useful). To my knowledge, the use of wheels for transport has been developed at best twice, and quite probably just once; the certain candidate for now appears to be a relatively small part of western Central Asia, and the possible other candidate is part of Central Europe, but the appearance of the wheel in both areas is so contemporary that’s possible that it represents one phenomena, or that one predates the other. This is a technology that then had to spread throughout the entirety of continental Eurasia, and much of Africa. The Egyptians, Babylonians, Assyrians Hittites, and Mycenaeans did not invent chariots. The Chinese did not invent chariots. The ancient Britons did not invent chariots. The Romans did not invent chariots. The ancient peoples of India did not invent chariots. Every single one of these famously complex societies was reliant on the invention developed in one part of the world. None of these people were ‘smart enough’ to sit down by themselves and realise that wheels can work when going across flat areas. Does this make the ancient Babylonians stupid? Does this make the precursors to the ancient Greeks stupid? Does this make China’s ancient cultures and societies stupid? The use of wheeled transport does not, it seems to my non-engineer brain, seem to be an intuitive piece of reasoning whatsoever. In addition, if Subsaharan Africa (in any of the three earlier definitions) is full of ridiculously large flat areas, somebody maybe ought to tell the enormous, malaria-infested rainforests that dominate Central Africa so that they can find new gainful employment. Or the mountains that rear from the earth like a great crocodile  under most of East Africa, right up to the earlier mentioned home territory of D’mt and Aksum. Oh, certainly there were flat bits in Africa, but by asking them to independently develop the wheel you are setting them a task that only at best two places in the entire world have matched, and we don’t even know the names of the people/s that achieved this feat. I don’t think the wheel as a mode of transport looks so simple as our protagonist suggested.\n",

Jews of all the World Unite In Action!\n&gt;    http://guardian.150m.com/jews/jews-declare-war.htm[1]\n\nof course I check the source and immediately found out that this was just a call to boycott Germany http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Nazi_boycott_of_1933\n\n\nThis happened immediately after Hitler took power. Obviously because since hitler stated in his book \"mein kampf\" what he thinks about jews.\n\nI told him that in my reply:\n\n&gt;Third line \"The Israeli people around the world declare economic and financial war against Germany\"\n&gt;\n&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1933[1]\n&gt;\n&gt;March 20 – Dachau, the first Nazi concentration camp, is completed (it opens March 22).\n&gt;\n&gt;March 23 – The Reichstag passes the Enabling Act, making Adolf Hitler dictator of Germany.\n&gt;\n&gt;March 24 – Jews call for a boycott of German goods.\n&gt;\n&gt;How about you learn to research stuff before you post this shit. And before you come with all this \"But they couldn't have known at that time\" nonsense, &gt;\"Mein Kampf\" was published in 1925, so it was not a secret what Hitler thought of the Jews.\n\n\n\nHe took the \"March 20 – Dachau, the first Nazi concentration camp, is completed (it opens March 22).\" (which was a copy from wiki) as me saying that jews were killed in Dachau on March 20 1933, which of course isn't true (thats why i added the \"mein kampf\" line to my reply)\n\n\nMore info about the actual incident: \n\nAs jews all over the world heard of the growing hatred from Germany, their opposition against Germany of course grew. The public opinion against Jews was at an all time low after the financial crisis (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression). \n\nIn Germany, according to historian Hans Mommsen, there were three types of antisemitism. In a 1997 interview, Mommsen was quoted as saying:\n\n\"One should differentiate between the cultural antisemitism symptomatic of the German conservatives – found especially in the German officer corps and the high civil administration – and mainly directed against the Eastern Jews on the one hand, and völkisch antisemitism on the other. The conservative variety functions, as Shulamit Volkov has pointed out, as something of a \"cultural code.\" This variety of German antisemitism later on played a significant role insofar as it prevented the functional elite from distancing itself from the repercussions of racial antisemitism. Thus, there was almost no relevant protest against the Jewish persecution on the part of the generals or the leading groups within the Reich government. This is especially true with respect to Hitler's proclamation of the \"racial annihilation war\" against the Soviet Union.\n\nBesides conservative antisemitism, there existed in Germany a rather silent anti-Judaism within the Catholic Church, which had a certain impact on immunizing the Catholic population against the escalating persecution. The famous protest of the Catholic Church against the euthanasia program was, therefore, not accompanied by any protest against the Holocaust.\n\n\nIn 1933, persecution of the Jews became an active Nazi policy, but at first laws were not as rigorously obeyed or as devastating as in later years. Such clauses, known as Aryan paragraphs, had been postulated previously by antisemitism and enacted in many private organizations.\n\n\nThe unrelenting Nazi abuse of Jews in Germany in the subsequent weeks led the American Jewish Congress to reconsider its opposition to public protests. In a contentious four-hour meeting held at the Hotel Astor in New York City on March 20, 1933, 1,500 representatives of various Jewish organizations met to consider a proposal by the AJCongress to hold a protest meeting at Madison Square Garden on March 27, 1933, as an additional 1,000 people attempting to enter the meeting were held back by police. New York Supreme Court Justice Joseph M. Proskauer and James N. Rosenberg spoke out against a proposed boycott of German goods that had been introduced by J. George Freedman of the Jewish War Veterans. Proskauer expressed his concerns against \"causing more trouble for the Jews in Germany by unintelligent action\", protesting against plans for mass meetings and reading a letter from Judge Irving Lehman that warned that \"the meeting may add to the terrible dangers of the Jews in Germany\". Honorary president Rabbi Stephen Samuel Wise delivered a rejoinder to Proskauer and Rosenberg, criticizing their failure to attend previous AJCongress meetings and insisting that \"no attention would be paid to the edict\" if mass protests had been rejected by the group. Wise noted that \"The time for prudence and caution is past. We must speak up like men. How can we ask our Christian friends to lift their voices in protest against the wrongs suffered by Jews if we keep silent? … What is happening in Germany today may happen tomorrow in any other land on earth unless its is challenged and rebuked. It is not the German Jews who are being attacked. It is the Jews.\" The group voted to go ahead with the meeting at Madison Square Garden. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Nazi_boycott_of_1933)\n\n\nOn April 1, 1933, in Germany, Jewish doctors, shops, lawyers and stores were boycotted. Only six days later, the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service was passed, banning Jews from being employed in government. This law meant that Jews were now indirectly and directly dissuaded or banned from privileged and upper-level positions reserved for \"Aryan\" Germans. From then on, Jews were forced to work at more menial positions, beneath non-Jews, pushing them to more labored positions.\n\nIn 1935 and 1936, the pace of persecution of the Jews increased. In May 1935, Jews were forbidden to join the Wehrmacht (Armed Forces), and that year, anti-Jewish propaganda appeared in Nazi German shops and restaurants. The Nuremberg Racial Purity Laws were passed around the time of the Nazi rallies at Nuremberg; On September 15, 1935, the Law for the Protection of German Blood and Honor was passed, preventing sexual relations and marriages between Aryans and Jews. At the same time the Reich Citizenship Law was passed and was reinforced in November by a decree, stating that all Jews, even quarter- and half-Jews, were no longer citizens (Reichsbürger) of their own country (their official status became Reichsangehöriger, \"subject of the state\"). This meant that they had no basic civil rights, such as that to vote. (But at this time the right to vote for the non-Jewish Germans only meant the obligation to vote for the Nazi party.) This removal of basic citizens' rights preceded harsher laws to be passed in the future against Jews. The drafting of the Nuremberg Laws is often attributed to Hans Globke.\n\n(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews_of_Germany#Jews_under_the_Nazis_.281933.E2.80.9345.29)\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "The Death of Major Peirson, 6 January 1781 is a painting by John Singleton Copley done in 1783. Copley was an American painter who seems to have done the portraits of just about everybody who was anybody in pre-Revolutionary War America. He wasn't much of a Loyalist, but his connections to the British (because of his painting) and his decidedly anemic Whig credentials prompted him to leave America in 1775 and go to Britain. \n\nThe event being depicted is the death of Major Francis Pierson during the [Battle of Jersey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Jersey). \n\nThe Battle of Jersey was an invasion by the French of the Jersey islands. It's tangentially related to the Revolutionary War because of the threat to French and American shipping that the Jersey island posed, but it's not really considered a part of the Revolutionary War. The island of Jersey is only 14 miles from the coast of France, and British privateers had been using it as a base to harass French &amp; American shipping. Because of it's strategic importance the island was heavily fortified and defended. There were many gun batteries, forts, and redoubts at various places on the island. In addition there were 3,000 men from the Royal Militia of Jersey, the 95th Regiment of Foot, five companies of the 83rd Regiment of Foot, five companies of the 78th Highlanders, and about 700 members of the invalid battallion. (Invalid battallions were comprised of soldiers who had been wounded and were too sick or crippled to do regular campaigning but could serve in garrison roles.)\n\nOn January 15, 1781 a French force of about 2000 set to land on the island, but disaster hit before they even landed. Several ships were crushed against the rocks with the loss of about 200 men, and nearly 600 men were separated from the main force and unable to rejoin with it. Thus the French had slightly more than 1000 men to attack the British forces and were handily defeated. The British lost 16 killed and 85 wounded to the French 86 dead, 72 wounded and 456 captured. \n\nOne of the dead was the commander of the forces on the island, Major Pierson (who had taken command when the island's governor was taken prisoner). The death of Pierson inspired Copely to make [this painting](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/John_Singleton_Copley_001.jpg/1024px-John_Singleton_Copley_001.jpg). \n\nThe painting has plenty of it's own bad history, but what really annoys me is how the painting (particularly one image) has been intrepreted. \n\n[Here](http://images.amazon.com/images/P/0195306694.MZZZZZZZ.jpg) it's being used as the cover image for the book [Death or Liberty: African Americans and Revolutionary America](http://www.amazon.com/Death-Liberty-African-Americans-Revolutionary/dp/0199782253), which is a pretty good book. However the cover is rather misleading, since there's A.) Only one African present, and B.) The subject of the painting has absolutely nothing to do with African-Americans, *or* Revolutionary America. \n\n[Here](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-3QDXEx-At-o/T3BSzNkMPhI/AAAAAAAAgPo/4rD609Zv_Y0/s1600/Gilbert.JPG) it's being used as the cover art for the book [Black Patriots and Loyalists: Fighting for Emancipation in the War of Independence](http://www.amazon.com/Black-Patriots-Loyalists-Emancipation-Independence/dp/0226293076) I have this book, but have not yet read it so I can't comment on it's quality. Again there's a big issue. 1.) There are no Loyalists or Patriots present in this painting, 2.) The subject of the painting isn't about the American War of Independence\n\nFinally [this](http://i.imgur.com/5juB5JQ.jpg) cropped image often shows up labeled as a black soldier in the American Revolution. Generally it's identified as a member of the group of ex-slaves raised by Lord Dunmore, which often goes by the name \"The Ethiopian Regiment\". For example [this](http://www.blackpast.org/aah/lord-dunmore-s-ethiopian-regiment) site associates the man with the Ethiopian Regiment, as does [this](http://blackloyalist.com/cdc/story/revolution/ethiopia.htm) one (which is even odder since they correctly note what the members of the regiment wore), as does [this](http://www.studythepast.com/history571/pam/EthiopianRegiment.html) one (though it at least notes what the title of the painting is). [This](http://blackmediamine.blogspot.com/2013/10/colonel-tye-black-loyalist.html) site associates the image with a man known as [Colonel Tye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonel_Tye) who was an escaped slave turned Loyalist guerrilla and who became quite feared. \n\nThe Ethiopian Regiment would have been dressed like [this](http://media-cache-cd0.pinimg.com/736x/e9/0d/9d/e90d9d77c2e1ee7cbda145ab9b356abf.jpg), with some of them wearing British uniforms, but most wearing simple shirts with the words \"Freedom to Slaves\" written on them. They certainly wouldn't be wearing the gaudy uniform depicted in the painting. \n\nIn short, the image has now entered the public consciousness as that of a member of a Loyalist regiment, when in reality he was the servant^1 of Major Pierson, wasn't even at the fighting that day, and most definitely wasn't an escaped black slave or a member of the Ethiopian Regiment.\n\n1.) In the 18th century the word \"servant\" was often used as a euphemism for \"slave\". I'm not sure if the man was Pierson's slave or not. ",

I'll bite.\n\n&gt;First. The dude was undoubtedly evil. Nothing I'm about to mention excuses any of the atrocities he is most definitely guilty of.\n\n&gt;Hitler had a pretty solid economic policy. He took a crumbling, failing nation, with a currency valued at so much less than the paper it was printed on, it's the source of that joke, and turned it in to an industrial powerhouse.\nSeriously. Pre war Germany under Hitler was doing remarkably well. Hitler, in fact, had reformed Germany so much that in 1939 he was time magazine's man of the year.\n\n&gt;He also built the highway system known lovingly around the world. (Eisenhower was pretty impressed by it. So much so that the Eisenhower interstate system is a pretty direct copy of Hitler's autobahn.) And was the driving force behind Porche and Volkswagon. He wanted a German car for everyone, and he made that happen.\nEdit: I think it's also important to note that the initial expansion into Europe by Hitler (the invasions that started WW2) were done for German \"living space.\" The lebensraum policy number one, meant more living space for Germans, Hitler wanted plenty of room for agricultural production after he finished the industrial expansion. He did this in a lot of areas. Germany was allowed a 100,000 man army, so Hitler commissioned every solder in the army. He had 100,000 officers prior to the war. He stayed very literally within the lines of the Versailles treaty all the way up to the invasion. He gave his officers shovels instead of weapons. It was, for lack of a better term, clever. He was not only charismatic, but socially very smart. One of the reasons Europe was so seemingly eager to pacify Germany was because he was doing so much to show them how he wasn't breaking the rules. Right up until he started invading people. By then, pacification was in full swing, and Europe was primed to deny that they would be next. (There's a great line in The Kings Speech that hints at this.) There are many other factors that lead to this, and Hitler was just as aware of them as we are today. He used all of that to his advantage.\n\n&gt;Tl;dr Hitler, while evil, cruel, and manipulative, did have a lasting positive effect on Germany, and his influence is still felt today, around the world.\n\nReplied there, so I'll just copy the response as an R5:\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&gt;Let me share  with you a nice quote by Hitler:\n\n&gt;&gt;The economy is of secondary importance\n\n&gt;Alright, now let's address your points:\n\n&gt;&gt;Hitler had a pretty solid economic policy. He took a crumbling, failing nation, with a currency valued at so much less than the paper it was printed on, it's the source of that joke, and turned it in to an industrial powerhouse.\n\n&gt;Bullshit. The man you're looking for is Hjalmar Schacht. *He* was the one who used Keynesian policies to rebuild the German economy. Hitler simply didn't care that much. Let's see what wikipedia has to say about him:\n\n&gt;&gt;In August 1934 Hitler appointed Schacht as Germany's Minister of Economics. Schacht supported public-works programs, most notably the construction of autobahnen (highways) to attempt to alleviate unemployment – policies which had been instituted in Germany by von Schleicher's government in late 1932, and had in turn influenced Roosevelt's policies. He also introduced the \"New Plan\", Germany's attempt to achieve economic \"autarky\", in September 1934. Germany had accrued a massive foreign currency deficit during the Great Depression, which continued into the early years of the Third Reich. Schacht negotiated several trade agreements with countries in South America and southeastern Europe, under which Germany would continue to receive raw materials, but would pay in Reichsmarks. This ensured that the deficit would not get any worse, while allowing the German government to deal with the gap which had already developed. Schacht also found an innovative solution to the problem of the government deficit by using mefo bills. He was appointed General Plenipotentiary for the War Economy in May 1934[9] and was awarded honorary membership in the NSDAP and the Golden Swastika in January 1937.\n\n&gt;Next then.\n\n&gt;&gt;He also built the highway system known lovingly around the world. \n\n&gt;Nope, Schacht. After a while, a rift began to appear regarding the economic policy where Schacht and others favoured a free market approach and less military spending, where others (Goring amongst them) chose the exact opposite (more military spending and more protectionism). The other side won, and Schacht was sidelined. He had become a member of the resistance a couple years earlier since he disagreed with the policies regarding the jews.\n\n&gt;&gt;And was the driving force behind Porche and Volkswagon. He wanted a German car for everyone, and he made that happen.\n\n&gt;Wrong again. Volkswagen was a failure. Germany had a population of 65 million people, and 336 000 of them ordered a Volkswagen. The entire project though was financially unhealthy and could only work because of Nazi corruption and lack of accountability.\n\n&gt;So do please tell me what thing Hitler actually accomplished.\n\n&gt;EDIT:\n\n&gt;&gt; The lebensraum policy number one, meant more living space for Germans, Hitler wanted plenty of room for agricultural production after he finished the industrial expansion. He did this in a lot of areas. \n\n&gt;This is complete bullshit. You really think Germany couldn't live off its own grounds? Then how the hell were they able to survive after world war II, instead of starving to death? Even if that was his intention, it only shows what a delusional idiot that man was. \n\n&gt;&gt; He stayed very literally within the lines of the Versailles treaty all the way up to the invasion.\n\n&gt;Wrong again.\n\n&gt;He broke it in:\n\n&gt;* 1934: he destroyed the League of Nations Disarmament Conference by demanding equality of arms with France and Britain – this broke the Treaty because it had set up the League with the stated aim of achieving disarmament. \n\n&gt;* 1935: he held a huge rearmament rally\n\n&gt;* 1936: by moving his troops in the demilitarized Rhineland zone. \n\n&gt;* 1938: by the Anschluss\n\n&gt;&gt; One of the reasons Europe was so seemingly eager to pacify Germany was because he was doing so much to show them how he wasn't breaking the rules.\n\n&gt;Like annexing regions and openly displaying his military power? Wut?\n\n&gt;&gt;Tl;dr Hitler, while evil, cruel, and manipulative, did have a lasting positive effect on Germany, and his influence is still felt today, around the world.\n\n&gt;Aaaaand here's where you're COMPLETELY wrong. What lasting positive effect did Hitler have on Germany? *Please* tell me? Correct me if I'm wrong, but when Hitler died Berlin looked like [this](http://ww2discovery.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Berlin-1945.jpg), the economy was shattered, and millions of Germans had died.\n\nEDIT: forgot the \"He was Times' person of the year in 1939 bit (it was 1938 but meh):\n\nWhat the people who say this don't understand Time Magazine simply give the 'person of the year' award to the person who dominated that year, they don't make a moral judgement about his/her policies. Hey, everyone reading this was the person of the year a couple years ago.\n\n[Here](http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,760539-2,00.html)'s the actual article from 1938 about hitler. It's a good read, and really not that positive about Hitler.\n\n",

        "text": "This shit really, really, really pisses me off for a number of reasons.  It's very easily refuted, but everything is just stuck in the mind of people in the US, so we keep getting this shit.\n\n[Link](http://www.cracked.com/photoplasty_984_29-images-that-will-change-how-you-picture-history/)\n\nFirst point of pissing me right the fuck off:\n\n&gt;27:  The US trained, armed, funded and supported Osama Bin Laden and his followers during the cold war.\n\nNo, no we did not.  The CIA had no interactions with Osama bin Laden for several reasons, not the least being he had his own damn money to spend on his rich-boy have fun spree.  Not only that, the US trained *no one*--we had 10 operatives on the ground in Afghanistan, and if you think you can train anyone with a cadre of ten men to cover a country, you're just insane.\n\nThe claims go on:\n\n&gt; With a huge investment of $3,000,000,000 (three billion US dollars) the CIA effectively created bin Laden's al Qaeda network.\n\nNo.  No we did not.  Again with the whole \"not having contact with bin Laden at all\".  The CIA funded subsets of the mujahideen, which were a very disparate group of people.  Afghanistan was a very fractious country, and has been for centuries.  The name itself means \"land of many voices\".  Tribal alliances and confederations each have their own goals and territory, and they all operate independently of each other.  To lump them together as al Qaeda is incredibly insulting.\n\nOnto number 21:\n\n&gt;21:  Ronald Reagaon.  Patriotic Conservative.  Here his is meeting with the Afghan Mujahideen, to whom he dedicated a 1982 shuttle launch.  Mujahideen was part of the extremist movement that gave birth to al Qaeda.\n\nFucking no.  I am too the fuck sober for this absolute, lying bullshit.  As I said above, the mujahideen were a very, very diverse group of people and we were very friendly with a number of them for a very long time for a good reason--a bunch of them *loved American and Western-style Democracy*.  Those were the guys we were funding and had over.  Mujahideen was a blanket term to anyone who was fighting the Soviets and communists in Afghanistan.  Quite literally the extent of the required political stance was being opposed to Soviet communism in Afghanistan, which last *I* checked, most of everyone was against--and not just in Afghanistan.  Calling them an extremist movement is incredibly wrong, unless \"fighting foreign invaders\" necessarily makes you an extremist.  As for becoming al Qaeda--no.  No.  Separate groups, etc.  Some mujahideen may have become members of al Qaeda, yes, but that's hardly indicative of the group.  With such a disparate group of people, blanket statements are really hard to make.  But, given that mujahideen were still fighting in 2001 against the new American enemy, the Taliban, it's really hard to say that they became al Qaeda.\n\nAnd, finally, [image number seven](http://i.crackedcdn.com/phpimages/photoshop/5/7/0/298570_v1.jpg).\n\nSorry, no.  This would have been typical in the urban areas, yes, but Afghanistan in the 50s wasn't a very urban country.  Most of it was quite rural, and in the rural areas, men and women still dressed traditionally.  If you visited Kabul, I'm quite certain most of the women you would have seen would have been dressed exactly like that.  However, if you were to go to the hinterlands near, say, Ghazni, *if* you saw a woman, she would have not at all been dressed like an American.  Not a burka either--they have their own traditional dresses that can be very colorful, especially the headscarves. \n\nI'm sure there's other shit in there, but goddamn, does that shit piss me off.

        "text": "[This](http://theweek.com/article/index/247460/7-of-john-adams-greatest-insults) page is making the rounds, praising John Adams for his insulting manner. John Adams really did have an acerbic tongue, and some of his insults are truly epic--thing is many of the ones listed here he didn't say, or are taken out of context.\n\n&gt;1.) ON BENJAMIN FRANKLIN\n\"His whole life has been one continued insult to good manners and to decency.\"\n\nThis isn't one of them. John Adams wrote [a letter](http://www.masshist.org/publications/apde/portia.php?id=ADMS-06-14-02-0253) to James Warren in 1783 and the entire thing is a rant against Benjamin Franklin. \n\n&gt;2.) ON ALEXANDER HAMILTON\n\"That bastard brat of a Scottish peddler! His ambition, his restlessness and all his grandiose schemes come, I'm convinced, from a superabundance of secretions, which he couldn't find enough whores to absorb!\"\n\nThere's no doubt that John Adams rather detested Alexander Hamilton. Except that this quote is actually two different quotes, and a made up quote.\n\n\"That bastard brat of a Scottish peddler!\" is from an 1806 letter sent January 25, 1806 to Dr. Benjamin Rush (and is pretty weak sauce compared to the other things Adams called Hamilton in that letter). \n\n\"His ambition, his restlessness and all his grandiose schemes come, I'm convinced\" is a made up line. It comes from an American Experience PBS episode and they rewrote the insult which was originally\n\n\"What a pity it is that our Congress had not known this discovery, and that Alexander Hamilton’s projects of raising an army of fifty thousand Men, ten thousand of them to be Cavalry and his projects of sedition Laws and Alien Laws and of new taxes to support his army, all arose from a superabundance of secretions which he could not find whores enough to draw off! and that the same vapours produced his Lyes and Slanders by which he totally destroyed his party forever and finally lost his Life in the field of Honor.\"\n\nThat portion of the letter is satire designed to mimic Jonathan Swift's *Tale of a Tub* where Swift explains that madness is caused by vapors that come from the lower body and go into the head. Here Adams is using the same concept but saying that the vapors are caused by semen because Hamilton couldn't get laid. It's a triple insult. \n\n1.) First is the obvious insult about the lies, slanders, and destroying his party.\n\n2.) Then there's the bit where he's calling Hamilton a mad man.\n\n3.) Then the last part where he says that Hamilton isn't getting laid enough. \n\n\n&gt;3.) ON THOMAS PAINE'S COMMON SENSE\n\"What a poor, ignorant, malicious, crapulous mass.\"\n\nThis is taken out of context. John Adams was comparing *Common Sense* to the Mecklenburg Declarations. John Adams had recently read a newspaper (this was in 1819!) which had reprinted the Mecklenburg Declarations and Adams was writing to Jefferson in praise of the Mecklenburg Declarations.\n\n&gt;How is it possible that this paper should have been concealed from me to this day—had it been communicated to me in the time of it—I know, if you do not know, that it would have been printed in every Whig News-paper upon this Continent— you know if I had possessed it—I would have made the Hall of Congress Echo—and re-echo, with it fifteen mongths before your Declaration of Independence—\n\n&gt;What a poor ignorant, malicious, short-sighted, Crapulous Mass, is Tom Pains Common Sense; in comparision with this paper—had I known it I would have Commented upon it—from the day you entered Congress till the fourth of July 1776.—\n\n[Letter from John Adams to Thomas Jefferson June 22, 1819](http://rotunda.upress.virginia.edu/founders/default.xqy?keys=FOEA-print-04-02-02-0519)\n\n&gt;4.) ON GEORGE WASHINGTON\n\"That Washington is not a scholar is certain. That he is too illiterate, unlearned, unread for his station is equally beyond dispute.\"\n\nThis one is actually taken out of context. Adams here is talking about the way Washington was when he first took command of the army. Following this statement he talks about the lack of travel of Washington, but then says that \"he had improved considerably\", and that Washington was \"indeed a Thoughtful Man\". \n\nIn fact the \"bastard brat\" line with regards to Hamilton is a reference to Hamilton impugning Washington's character.\n\n Adams says this about Washington \"His character as an able General, a wise Statesman, and an honest Man, is justly established, with the present age and Posterity and beyond the reach of those railers and all who resemble them in self conceit and nature.\" and then a little later says that Washington's reputation \" . . .will command the esteem of the wisest and best men of all ages.\"\n\n&gt;5.) ON THE CITY OF PHILADELPHIA\n\"Phyladelphia [sic], with all its trade and wealth and regularity, is not Boston. The morals of our people are much better; their manners are more polite and agreeable... Our language is better, our taste is better, our persons are handsomer; our spirit is greater, our laws are wiser, our religion is better, our education is better. We exceed them in every thing, but in a market.\"\n\nThis is only part of the quote and it's edited. Here's the full deal:\n\n\"Phyladelphia with all its Trade, and Wealth, and Regularity is not Boston. The Morals of our People are much better, their Manners are more polite, and agreable—they are purer English. Our Language is better, our Persons are handsomer, our Spirit is greater, our Laws are wiser, our Religion is superiour, our Education is better. We exceed them in every Thing, but in a Markett, and in charitable public foundations.\"\n\n[Letter to Abigail Adams October 9, 1774](http://www.masshist.org/publications/apde/portia.php?mode=p&amp;vol=DJA02&amp;page=150)\n\n&gt;6.) ON THOMAS JEFFERSON\n\"His soul is poisoned with ambition.\"\n\nThis is only half the insult. The full insult is\n\n\"instead of being the ardent pursuer of science that some think him, I know he is indolent, and his soul is poisoned with Ambition\"\n\nLetter to Abigail, December 26, 1793\n\n&gt;7.) ON JOHN DICKINSON\nWhile working as a member of the American revolution's Continental Congress, Adams referred to one of his less-radical colleagues as \"a piddling genius\"\n\nThe full text is \"A certain great Fortune and piddling Genius whose Fame has been trumpeted so loudly, has given a silly Cast to our whole Doings \"\n\nAdams then goes on to say how he *really* feels:\n\n&gt;We are between Hawk and Buzzard—We ought to have had in our Hands a Month ago, the whole Legislative, Executive and Judicial of the whole Continent, and have compleatly moddelled a Constitution, to have raised a Naval Power and opened all our Ports wide, to have arrested every Friend to Government on the Continent and held them as Hostages for the poor Victims in Boston. And then opened the Door as wide as possible for Peace and Reconcilliation: After this they might have petitioned and negotiated and addressed, &amp;c. if they would.—Is all this extravagant?—Is it wild?—Is it not the soundest Policy?\n\n\nThis would end up biting him in the rear, as the letters were seized by the British and printed in British papers. This was awkward, because at the same time the Congress was also extending the Olive Branch Petition (an effort spear headed by John Dickinson), among others.\n\nAlso this is pretty mild as insults go. Adams once said of the Continental Congress that \"To draw the characters of them all . . . would not be considered as a caricature-print; one-third tories, another whigs, and the rest mongrels.\"\n\nCalling someone a \"piddling genius\" compared to a Tory or a mongrel? Downright mild.",

I'm not sure of the exact date of the video but it would have been made in the late 50s, early 60s since the M14 was adopted about that time. (Maybe /u/Georgy_K_Zhukov or /u/mosin91 can provide more info) As the presenter talks about the history of firearms in the U.S. Army, he of course has to go all the way back to the Revolutionary War. \n\n\"It's a far cry\" he says \"from Bunker Hill and the Revolutionary War musket\"\n\nThen we get get [this guy](http://i.imgur.com/UENkbMp.jpg). Let me pause your regularly scheduled programming for a minute *hahahahahahahahahaha*. Whew. OK I'm back. But really, that uniform! Even in 1959 they knew better than that! Some of the best information we have on uniforms of the Revolutionary War comes from historians of the early 20th century.\n\nFor reference, the closest thing I can think of to what that guy is wearing might be something like [this](http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/arts/yourpaintings/images/paintings/plm/large/ptb_plm_plymg_a17_large.jpg), or [this](http://inlandrice.ccroadwise.org/_images/large/goldenage6_large.jpg). The first portrait is that of Charles Cornwallis, the second is that of Henry Clinton. Both uniforms are of the style of the early French &amp; Indian War period--so late 1750s, early 1760s. Neither one of them has even a faint resemblance to whatever it is that the guy is wearing. \n\n\"The Brown Bess it was called. Used by the British, but we copied the Charleville musket\".  Well actually the Brown Bess remained extremely popular on both sides of the conflict. At Bunker Hill and Lexington &amp; Concord the Brown Bess was the main weapon used by both sides. It would remain popular for militias (especially in New England), though militia forces also used American made copies of the Brown Bess or other cobbled together weapons.\n\nAnd Americans didn't just copy the Charleville. They used the Charleville in great numbers. The French shipped something like 200,000 Charleville muskets to the American forces to use\n\n\"If all went well the ball would go in the general direction that the musket was pointed\". I've already [addressed the myth of the inaccuracy of the musket](http://np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2aj6vu/the_myth_of_the_utter_unreliability_of_the_short/).\n\n\"He would be ready to fire again in the time it took to say 'Jack Robinson'. Oh about fifty times\". Maybe if he was the slowest soldier to ever take the field. Try it. Time yourself saying Jack Robinson fifty times (don't lose track). You'll find that it takes about 40 seconds to say it fifty times. Well trained soldiers could fire up to three rounds a minute. Even a poorly trained soldier can fire faster than every 40 seconds. \n\n\"We had a secret weapon in the Revolutionary War. It's known as the Kentucky Rifle.\" Apparently Revolutionary War frontiersmen [dressed like John Wayne](http://i.imgur.com/Eo5bEIA.jpg). At this point [words fail me.](http://i.imgur.com/hLmo0lg.gif) At least he acknowledges that it started out in Pennsylvania before it became famous as the Kentucky long rifle (though it was being used in Kentucky nearly contemporary with Pennsylvania)\n\n\"Wherever this rifle appeared in the Revolutionary War--Bunker Hill, Saratoga, King's Mountain--it made a deadly impression\".\n\n1.) Bunker Hill. There were no riflemen at Bunker Hill, or if there were individuals with rifles they made up a very, very small minority.\n\n2.) Saratoga. There were some riflemen at Saratoga (e.g. Daniel Morgan's men), but again they were vastly outnumbered by the muskets.\n\n3.) King's Mountain. In the South is the one field of operations where American forces had large numbers of riflemen. \n\nHe does acknowledge that the rifle made only an intermittent appearance, so there's that at least.\n\nMost of this stuff I've covered before, but I just really wanted to take an opportunity to laugh at the two reenactors. \n\n**Edit:**\n\nTo give some context for my criticisms of the outfits being worn, here are two photos from the 20s and 30s of reenactors.\n\n[Concord Bridge militia men 1928](http://i.imgur.com/evYYjQK.jpg)\n\n[Concord Bridge redcoats 1928](http://i.imgur.com/GPbhl7H.jpg)\n\n[Lexington Green--1930s](http://i.imgur.com/mxlqrSR.jpg)\n\n",

REALLY???\n\nTo highlight why this is uttermost bull-fucking-shit, I’m going to start with [political cartoons from the era](https://www.google.com/search?q=political+cartoons+suffragettes&amp;rlz=1C1PRFA_enUS435US436&amp;es_sm=122&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=4n_IU4_7FoL6oAT6y4L4BA&amp;ved=0CB4QsAQ&amp;biw=1220&amp;bih=606#imgdii=_).\n\nSuffrage was not in any way uncontroversial. There were large numbers of anti-suffragettes during this time period, and with it came the political cartoons. Many of them depict suffragettes as ugly harpies who could not find love, or as nagging women. Others claimed that suffragettes were emasculating men, forcing them to take on the woman’s role of stay at home parent. At least one comic claimed that [suffragettes need to be locked up](http://mentalfloss.com/sites/default/files/styles/insert_main_wide_image/public/suffragette2use.jpg). Another would [invoke George Washington](http://mentalfloss.com/sites/default/files/styles/insert_main_wide_image/public/suffragette1.jpg) to spread the anti-women’s suffrage message. \n\nThe controversy would even spread to works such as [Alice Miller’s *Are Women People? A Book of Rhymes for Suffrage Times*](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/11689/11689-h/11689-h.htm), a pro-women’s suffrage work that would make counter arguments mocking the anti-women’s suffrage argument, in poems such as this:\n\n&gt;     You're twenty-one to-day, Willie,\n&gt;     And a danger lurks at the door,\n&gt;     I've known about it always,\n&gt;     But I never spoke before;\n&gt;     When you were only a baby\n&gt;     It seemed so very remote,\n&gt;     But you're twenty-one to-day, Willie,\n&gt;     And old enough to vote.\n\n&gt;     You must not go to the polls, Willie,\n&gt;     Never go to the polls,\n&gt;     They're dark and dreadful places\n&gt;     Where many lose their souls;\n&gt;     They smirch, degrade and coarsen,\n&gt;     Terrible things they do\n&gt;     To quiet, elderly women—\n&gt;     What would they do to you!\n\n&gt;     If you've a boyish fancy\n&gt;     For any measure or man,\n&gt;     Tell me, and I'll tell Father,\n&gt;     He'll vote for it, if he can.\n&gt;     He casts my vote, and Louisa's,\n&gt;     And Sarah, and dear Aunt Clo;\n&gt;     Wouldn't you let him vote for you?\n&gt;     Father, who loves you so?\n\n&gt;     I've guarded you always, Willie,\n&gt;     Body and soul from harm;\n&gt;     I'll guard your faith and honor,\n&gt;     Your innocence and charm\n&gt;     From the polls and their evil spirits,\n&gt;     Politics, rum and pelf;\n&gt;     Do you think I'd send my only son\n&gt;     Where I would not go myself?\n\n&gt; \\- “A Consistent Anti to Her Son”, Alice Miller\n\nIt was argued that women didn’t need to vote, because the man’s vote was enough to represent her desires in regards to politics. In addition, it was said that women would be in danger from going to vote, and that they were too innocent and delicate for political decision making. A woman’s sphere was in the home; the political sphere was the sphere of men, and that’s how it should be. The arguments were less about “we don’t want women being conscripted” and more like “women are too delicate to handle voting and anyways why would they want to have their own voice when their husband’s voice was good enough?”\n\nAlso of note, you might notice that some of the poems start with a quote from anti-suffrage proponents… including one Mr. Webb from North Carolina, who claimed that \"I am opposed to woman suffrage, but I am not opposed to woman.\", and a Mr. Bowdle, who said in a speech to Congress that \"The women of this smart capital are beautiful. Their beauty is disturbing to business; their feet are beautiful, their ankles are beautiful, but here [on the topic of women’s suffrage] I must pause.\" A J. B. Sanford prepared [a speech against a state amendment calling for women’s suffrage in 1911](http://sfpl.org/pdf/libraries/main/sfhistory/suffrageagainst.pdf), arguing that a woman’s place was in the home, and that she must be kept from voting to “keep the home pure”. There were men’s anti-women’s suffrage organizations throughout the United States, such as [this organization in Nebraska](http://www.nebraskastudies.org/0700/frameset_reset.html?http://www.nebraskastudies.org/0700/stories/0701_0114.html). Etc, etc, etc.\n\nSo, yes, THERE WERE MEN WERE AGAINST SUFFRAGE. AND THEY PROVIDED RESISTANCE. AND THEY WERE ARGUING THAT WOMEN WERE TOO DELICATE TO HANDLE THE POLITICAL PROCESS.\n\nYes, other women did actually oppose suffrage. [There was a petition from the Women’s Voters Anti-Suffrage Party of New York](http://www.archives.gov/global-pages/larger-image.html?i=/education/lessons/woman-suffrage/images/ny-petition-l.gif&amp;c=/education/lessons/woman-suffrage/images/ny-petition.caption.html), signed by a number of women who were against suffrage in the belief that it was distracting from World War 1. Vice President Marshall once said \"My wife is against suffrage, and that settles me.\" It’s even denoted in a stanza of one of Miller’s poems:\n\n&gt;     I'm in a hard position for a perfect gentleman,\n&gt;     I want to please the ladies, but I don't see how I can,\n&gt;     My present wife's a suffragist, and counts on my support,\n&gt;     But my mother is an anti, of a rather biting sort;\n&gt;     One grandmother is on the fence, the other much opposed,\n&gt;     And my sister lives in Oregon, and thinks the question's closed;\n&gt;     Each one is counting on my vote to represent her view.\n&gt;     Now what should you think proper for a gentleman to do?\n\n&gt; \\- “Representation”, Alice Miller \n\nBut both men and women opposed suffrage, and they weren’t really thinking “women shouldn’t vote because ZOMG WHAT IF WOMEN GET CONSCRIPTED”.\n\n&gt; Feminists like to paint it as a struggle, but in reality they only had to march from town to town to get some signatures.\n\nAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA\n\nNo.\n\nSuffragettes would hold demonstrations for women’s suffrage, such as [this demonstration at the White House on 4 March 1917.](http://www.loc.gov/item/mnwp000293/) Women, such as [Vida Miholland](http://www.loc.gov/item/mnwp000252) and [Helena Hill Weed](http://www.loc.gov/item/mnwp000060), got arrested in the name of suffrage. [Susan B. Anthony](http://www.nwhm.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Susan-B.-Anthony-trial-poster2.jpg) got arrested for illegally voting, charged, had her case sent to trial, and was [found guilty and charged $100—which she never paid](http://blogs.archives.gov/prologue/?p=8702). [Suffragettes participated in hunger strikes in prison.](http://www.loc.gov/item/mnwp000243/) Many suffragettes were then force-fed, an event that [Alice Paul would describe for the papers](http://www.loc.gov/item/rbcmiller003904) in 1909. Suffragettes would also protest the imprisonment of their fellow activists, [as seen in this picture](http://www.loc.gov/item/mnwp000224/) Etc.\n\nIt was never as simple as “get a whole bunch of people to sign petitions”. It was a full on battle, with demonstrations, songs, propaganda, numerous articles, arrests, hunger strikes, and more. It’s utterly misleading to claim that women didn’t really have to do much to gain suffrage, because *they absolutely did*.\n\nTL;DR: MRA argues that the fight against women’s suffrage was all led by women who didn't wanna fight as soldiers and that women getting the right to vote was as easy as getting a few signatures. MRA is totally 100% wrong. Also, lots of primary sources.",
