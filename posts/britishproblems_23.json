        "text": "This mainly applies to hotels but I guess it covers flights and other stuff too. \n\nAfter using booking.com for a good number of hotels, on several occasions over the years I’ve been told (usually politely except for a couple of examples) that it’s always cheaper to book direct than to go through a third party.  \n\nUnless I’ve been particularly unlucky, it’s simply not true. I booked a best western a couple of weeks ago. £117 on their website £87 on booking.com for the same room with same restrictions / times / whatever else. \n\nI get that there are charges from third party retailers so they want to encourage customers to use their own site but don’t say “it’s cheaper” if it isn’t.",
