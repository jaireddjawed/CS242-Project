Just simple life and human emotions coming to life. What I really loved about it is the use of beautiful language to describe common, mundane events in life. I have learnt about so many flowers reading the Anne series. I have started appreciating the simpler things in life such as the weather, the flowers and trees around me, people in my life and everything else that comes between. I have also become a lot more observant because reading this book taught me that we don't have to wait for grand things to happen to us in order to enjoy and appreciate life. Life is already filled with joy and love if we choose to look at it that way.\n\nAnd how could I forget the lovely Anne and the wonderful and caring Gilbert. Excellent people with skills and personalities that complement one another. It is such a joy to read their story blossoming throughout the series. \n\nThe books also taught me about growing up and evolving over time, how Anne starts off as a naughty and bubbly young girl and gets transformed into a lovely and demure lady.\n\n It is truly such an exciting way to learn about life and the people around us. I love LM Montgomery's writing and I loved the Anne series very much❤️",

But she ends up having Mind of a child and he has to teach her how to be person.  I don't know the rest because I read it so long ago please help thank you. I'm pretty sure this story is told from a robot that this man rescued from a junkyard of some sort (he collects old technology). The cover has a bunch of odd looking things like a TV (I think) with a eyeball and table with legs. And on the back the robot is there. I think the living furniture are called buddies or conforts or something like that idk. I think the title has something with eve but I'm not sure",

This has mostly been done by keeping a brief plot summary of a novel I've read in my journal that I can review at a later date, especially when I'm picking up the next book in a series. I've found that doing this has been very helpful for fiction.\n\nNow, I think I'm ready to try to tackle non fiction. Just to note, I'm not currently in school, so any non fiction I read is just for personal enjoyment and enrichment. With that said, I would like to find a way to help me retain a bit more from the non fiction I'm reading. \n\nSo with all of that background out of the way, I'm curious to hear from members of the community who take notes when reading non fiction. How do you take notes? How detailed are they and how do you determine what to write down or expand on? Do you find doing this is useful in helping you retain more from what you are reading?\n\nThanks!",

I think I would like a reader like the kindle though, perhaps the barns and nobles nook or that kobo one?  \n\nBut I like some real obscure stuff.  Like there's a book by a sci fi writer called M. John. Harrison and he wrote a book called the Centauri Device?  I rented it from the library a while back and they had to special order it from another library.  I had to look up the book number and everything.  \n\nSo question ... how would I go about building my digital library?  If I use the Nook or the Kobo can I then go ahead and store these books somewhere?  like on my computer?",

Not that O'Brien ever really tries to make us feel any.\n\nIt's very well written and has Peter Straub's literary fingerprints all over it. If you liked Straub's *Koko* or *The Throat*, you'll love this. The prose is cold and dispassionate when taking you through the most awful horrors humans can inflict on each other and plays an absolute fascinating game of intellectual cat and mouse regarding what happened, how it happened whilst totally leaving the characters history and personality to provide the why.\n\nLakes are mysterious and the woods are pretty mysterious too and the author really uses that mystery within a mystery of locations to parallel the books central mystery that's wrapped up in the mystery of the main character.\n\nI do think I need something a bit lighthearted after the last 5 books or so though. Possibly a re-read of one of the Aubrey/Maturin series to cleanse the pallet.",

The whole book thus far feels like an endless, self congratulating, masturbatory, soliloquy from a pompous ass who can't commit to any thought or belief; while simultaneously committing to things to an absurd degree only to abandon them. ALSO Before he abandons the church is he jerking off *for God* ?!  Stephen is so irritating, smug, delusional &amp; narcissistic; he denegrades everyone he comes into contact with he elevates himself over everyone with no real ground He got into university so he is better than the preists, he stayed in school so he is better than the men in town. I do not understand the praise the lexicon is repetitive the feeling is akin to literary waterboarding. \n\nCan ANYONE explain the appeal of this book?",

        "text": "Seems like every in book the romance plot involves one rescuing/helping their romance interest from something, and a romance forming from their. Doesnt matter the gender/age/socioeconomic status of the rescuee or rescuer its always gotta be someone being rescued and the other falling for their rescuer, but like, that shits poison to a relationship ya know? and it never gets acknowledged. Even if you have great chemistry with someone, the knowledge in the back of your head that one party 'owes' the other to a certain extent makes dealing with the normal relationship issues much more emotionally complex. And this is such a normal and common experience that countless humans have had that i cant believe its so popular and unacknowledged for this to keep being written and praised all the time. I am a boring ass person, and ive seen/experienced relationships formed of helping someone out of depression/addiction, supporting a stranger in a bad spot, or even the more generic stuff like falling in love with your psych/doctor etc. It never works out. If the relationship was established before it became uneven, i could understand then. Seems like sometimes that works out irl (though a lot of times ive also seen it not.) But if its the foundation? you cant build a solid house on a skewed foundation. Every time i read a book and the romance starts with such an uneven dynamic and doesnt look like its gonna do anything to shift it or acknowledge it, i just start skipping all romance interactions.",

Briefly, it documents the collapse of society due to economic, ecological, and sociological problems, through the eyes of a teenager. We can see the seeds of these problems in our own society now. \n\nI just started the second book, Parable of the Talents. Our narrater is discussing a new politician from Texas who is harnessing traditional Christian revivalism as his platform. His followers are persecuting anyone of different faith or creed. He only pays mild lip service to rebuking the violence. Then I read this passage:\n\n“As for the beatings, the tarring and feathering, the “destruction of the heathen houses of devil-worship” he has a simple answer: “Join us! Our doors are open to every nationality, every race! Leave your sinful past behind, and become one of us. Help us to make America greats again!”\n\nI shivered and had goosebumps. Was I reading something recent? Because that would be a little on the nose. I immediately checked the publishing date. The first book was written in 1993. This book was in 1998. \n\nHoly cow. I was already impressed and a little freaked out by this all-too realistic dystopia Butler has written, but now I’m convinced she was down right prescient. \n\nAnd that’s a scary thought.",

I've been looking for another Wuxia series to read ever since I read the amazing Cradle series, and after reading the reviews that people gave this book I really want to read it. \n\nMy only problem is that this book was published in 2016 and I can't find any mention online of further books in this series, or even any release dates mentioned for a volume 2. I don't want to get into a book that has an incomplete story, so could some kind soul tell me if there are any more books in the series, either already published or going to be published, or if this book is indeed a completed story in its own right please? \n\nMany thanks",

        "text": "I've read Aztec, Aztec Autumn, Journeyer, and the openings of Raptor and Spangle.\n\nThere are three things most of his protagonists are guaranteed: a) skepticism in the supernatural/religious, which are often highly suggested as real; b) a general derision for almost any culture outside his own, unless he happens to fall in love with a woman from one, and c) a gigantic interest in all kinds of sex, the more taboo, the better.\n\na) I admit this trait is what makes his books the most engrossing to me. At every turn the hero interacts with people who miraculously grant him new opportunities, for whom he always seeks a rational explanation. Yet they almost always are implied to be gods, ancient figures, and wizards of the age working on him.\n\nb) The Aztec and Journey novels really disparage people outside the Empire or Italy. These people are backwards and crazy, their religions are laughable, most of their food is unusual or gross, and they contribute little in the way of wisdom. Until he falls in love with a foreign girl, and suddenly they're pretty interesting folks. But he's still taking her away from her backwards culture and into civilization.\n\nc) Just what is this guy's obsession with graphic sex? Did he want to write illicit porn? Why are his characters so damn horny or consantly put in the way of horny things? Every novel he seeks to shock you with some lewd act as quickly as possible, and progress to even more acts throughout the book. All kinds of consensual and non-consensual sex, of all ages, legal and not, on the down low or for public titillation. Same-sex is generally vilified, unless one man has been castrated or it's between two women, even when it's non-consensual. The opening of Raptor has the hero discover their unique characteristic just how you'd expect of Jennings.",
