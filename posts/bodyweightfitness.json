It is just that the routine comprises only major full-body movements with proper progressions and a plan. \n\nOne example of such a simple routine is the one propagated by Kyle Boggerman aka Kboges.

I have an ok fitness level, bouldered for a lot of years, and I want to continue doing some sort of resistance training during my travels, and the routines here look very complete and like a good fit for my goals (general health and mobility, some hypertrophy and gaining strength for some cool skills like handstands).\nOnly problem is, I only have a yoga mat and 3 resistance bands. I know there's a lot of ways to do rows and pullups, I did them for years in my house using high stairs for PU and a strong table for rows. But since every few days I'm moving from place to place, and most guesthouses have no furniture sturdy enough for me to rely on, I can consistently do BW rows or push ups. Question is: can I replace BW rows with resistance band seated rows, and pull ups with band lat pull downs? Are there better ways  to hit the same muscle groups? \n\nThank you for any advice :)\n\nEDIT:\nThanks everyone for the advice. I know the best thing would be to just find somewhere to hang and go there, but right now where I'm traveling there arent lots of parks, so even if I do find something reliable to hang from, its not always a comfortable place to workout at. And the main thing is, I'll admit that its very hard to find motivation and time to do a workout while backpacking, so I wanna remove any friction from it and make it easy for myself to workout anywhere.","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1678633438.0},{"title":"I got fat and have horrible stretch marks all over my body now is this how i will look now forever?","author":"Confident-Rate-7245","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/bodyweightfitness\/comments\/11qa3jn\/i_got_fat_and_have_horrible_stretch_marks_all\/","text":"I am 19 yo guy i was working out everyday, had some muscle , abs but somebody close to me passed away and it got me pretty depressed.

I know that a lot of you practice handstands and handstand push-ups. Before taking your handstands away from the wall, it's important to feel confident in your forward roll so that you can properly bail. In this video I demonstrate a forward roll, stepping into a forward roll, diving into a forward roll, and a handstand into a forward roll. I think that this is an easy progression to follow. You should practice each move for sets of 1 to 10 and strive for perfect technique. Before moving onto the next move, you should be able to hit three clean reps in a row. As Coach Steves used to say \"Once is a mistake, twice is luck, and three times means you got it.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you're struggling with the forward roll, I recommend that you practice the deck squat. If you really want to work on exploding out of the roll, you can begin the decksquat from a candlestick with your arms overhead. Honestly, I don't think that these moves require too much instruction. Just make sure to pay attention to where your back makes contact with the ground. Coach Steves would have us practice our tumbling skills on a slight decline at the beach. You probably won't need that for these, but it does help when you're learning the cartwheel, roundoff, and handsprings.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm 36 years old ex-gymnast and walking around at 85 kg. I try to maintain 78-80 kg but let myself go a bit during school vacation. I think that anyone can learn these skills, but I imagine that it's difficult to learn them as an adult. If you add in a bit of tumbling practice at the beginning of your sessions, I think you can learn these moves within a month. They really do stick with you. I haven't attempted a front handspring since my late twenties. Coach Steves would tell me that my feet were staggered, my technique was sloppy, and that I needed to drop some poundage.

[u\/Prowland12](https:\/\/new.reddit.com\/user\/Prowland12\/) recently [wrote a post](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/bodyweightfitness\/comments\/11mglmr\/a_guide_to_kettlebells_for_the_calisthenics) on the [r\/bodyweightfitness](https:\/\/new.reddit.com\/r\/bodyweightfitness\/) subreddit outlining the basic principles of Kettlebell training for Calisthenics athletes. The post was really good in terms of outlining the fundamentals, however I do have some criticisms of it, and i feel it missed out a few points. It inspired me to write the inverse, and hopefully expand upon some of their points, whilst also giving further insight into how each modality can compliment each other.\n\nA bit of my background, I consider myself an intermediate lifter with both modalities (I have attained intermediate-high levels of calisthenics skills, and mastery of a 32kg bell over 6y of calisthenics training and 2.5y of kettlebell training). Primarily I see myself as a calisthenics athlete (my training does bias calisthenics in general), however I have spent the last 2.5 years really honing in on combining them in a way that is effective and allows for progression in both.\n\nFirst I would like to define *calisthenics* and *bodyweight training* (note, this is my personal definition). Calisthenics is a system of training that leads to advanced gymnastics type movements, such as front\/back lever, human flag, planche, various ring skills, etc. The movements within these systems are often in two parts - the skill, and the strength. In broad terms, the skill component is a phase in which you teach your body to acquire the correct positioning of the scapula relative to the rest of your body, and the strength component is a phase in which you build strength in the relative muscle groups. The skill component is highly specialised, meaning that you are using exercises or movement patterns that are generally not found in any other training modalities (more on this later), and the strength portion uses a combination of standard compound movements and specialised exercises to build strength through ranges of motion specific to the skill.\n\nBodyweight training on the other hand, is a selection of basic compound movements such as the pull up, dip, push up, squat, and inverted row, which can potentially be loaded to progress.\n\nNow that we have those two separate, I would also like to mention that my kettlebell training has solely been within hardstyle, which I feel is most conducive to being combined with calisthenics training. GS is a whole sport unto itself, and whilst I'm sure it could be programmed alongside some calisthenics or bodyweight training, the training volume and adaptations needed to excel at GS is greatly in opposition to calisthenics.\n\n***Why should a kettlebell athlete consider Calisthenics\/bodyweight training, or vice versa? What benefits does each modality offer?***\n\nFirst, let's establish the most important factor - convenience. It's very common for people training kettlebells and\/ or calisthenics\/bodyweight training modalities to train at home. People need convenience if they are to be able to fit the equipment needed in their living spaces. Barbells and machines take up a lot of room, so having smaller and fewer pieces of equipment is really important.\n\nMoving on...\n\n**For the Kettlebell athlete:**\n\n*Upper body vertical pull and push -* Truly, the only movement pattern that kettlebell training is missing is upper body vertical plain. Pull ups and dips can be a welcome addition to any kettlebell program, and are easily scaled or overloaded via bands\/ concentric, or adding weight to a belt, respectively.\n\n*The rings -* a unique piece of equipment, and one of the most convenient form factors that provides a huge amount of variety. The sheer number of upper body exercises that can be performed with the rings is legion, and the variety they can add to any program can be hugely beneficial. *QUICK TIP:* do not take pushing exercises on rings for granted, the instability when above the rings means you must work slowly and cautiously towards any vertical or horizontal pushing movement. Pulling movements however can be accessed immediately, and the free movement of the rings can actually be a huge benefit as they allow free scapula and wrist movement when compared to the closed kinetic chain of a bar.\n\n*Straight arm strength -* here we start getting into the more unique benefits of the calisthenics. Straight arm strength can be defined as any pattern of movement in which the elbows remain in full extension throughout. Commonly, the high level calisthenics skills such as your levers and planches require the elbow to remain stationary, whilst the fulcrum of the shoulder joint moves through a range of motion. This type of movement puts extreme pressure on the connective tissue of the elbow (usually the biceps tendon) and scapulas, and without correct preparation and pre-habilitation, can result in serious injuries. A great way to get a sense of straight arm strength is to get into a push up position, fully protract the scapula and externally rotate your arms, and gently lean forward (this is called a planche lean). You will immediately start to feel pressure on the biceps tendon, as it works hard to stabilise the elbow joint. Some nice progressions include all the support positions on the rings, with the rings turned out as far as possible (just make sure to stabilise the scapula by depressing and protracting as hard as possible).\n\n*Arms isolation work -* Whilst it is completely possible to perform isolation exercises for your arms with kettlebells, it's just way more convenient with calisthenics. The various curling and triceps extension exercises available with a bar and especially with rings are a worthy contender when compared to the equivalent kettlebell version.\n\n*Scapula isolation work* \\- calisthenics offers unparalleled ways to directly train the scapula. The scapula is the foundation for all upper body exercises and encompasses a huge range of muscles from the traps, serratus, rotater cuff, and many more. One of its role is to stabilise the shoulder blades relative to the rib cage and shoulder girdle, so a weak or poor connection to the scapula can result in any number of problems and injuries. Being albe to directly train the scapula in every plane of movement, with gravity acting in every direction (hanging, inverted, in a support hold, in a plank etc) will greatly improve strength and upper body health.\n\n*Interoception -* something slightly more conceptual, but definitely worth mentioning is the ability to become closely connected to your body with calisthenics\/bodyweight training. Learning to control a load through space via weight training has huge real world application, but having the ability to manipulate your own body through space cannot be understated. We are not perfect beings, we're clumsy and uncoordinated at times, and having a strong connection to the naturalistic movement patterns of your body can literally save your life in certain situations.\n\n*Relative strength -* Something all calisthenics athletes understand is that having a lower body weight will make calisthenics easier. It just makes sense knowing that the load you are moving is governed by how much you weigh. Calisthenics athletes will strive to have as low body fat as possible to make up for this, however, the inverse is also true in lifting external weights. Often we are resisting against the weight, especially in things like kettlebell swings, so having more weight to resist against this will prove beneficial.\n\n*Fun skills -* Honestly this isn't hugely important and highly individualised, but learning calisthenics skills is incredibly fun and fulfilling. Getting that first handstand hold, or your first lever skill is one of the most rewarding things you can achieve when pursuing calisthenics.\n\n**And for the Calisthenics athlete:**\n\n*The hinge -* The hip hinge movement pattern is notably missing in calisthenics\/bodyweight training. There is just no good way to overload the hip hinge without weights. For a completely balanced system of training, no muscle groups can be left out, so it is vital that some kind of weighted hinging pattern must be included in a calisthenics\/bodyweight program. It's non-negotiable, especially when you consider how vital the lower back and hamstrings are in their contribution to overall health and injury prevention (especially as we age!)\n\n*Progressive overload for lower body exercises -* Continuing from the previous point about hinging, lower body training in general is not easily overloaded. Yes, it could be seen as a benefit to have smaller amounts of lower body mass when pursuing calisthenics skills, especially levers, but considering we use our legs in real world applications far more than our upper bodies, neglecting not only the most used, but also the largest muscle groups in the body will have detrimental effects to overall health as we get older. I live by the phrase \"to only train half of your body is to only experience half of what life has to offer\"\n\n*Rotational work -* Another missing component of calisthenics\/bodyweight training is spinal rotation. It is hugely beneficial to the structural integrity and overall health of our spine. Things like bridge rotations and around the world leg raises can help, but have high points of entry, so it's worth considering the kettlebell alternatives. A programming that includes moving the spine in the rotational plain through a large range of motion, as well as resisting spinal rotation will fill in all the gaps here, so including windmills and single arm swings are well worth considering.\n\n*Axial loading\/spinal erectors -* Yet another missing component in calisthenics\/bodyweight training modalities is the ability to load from the top down. This is another hugely important aspect of spine health and overall longevity or improved health span, so including goblet or racked versions of basic lower body compounds can be really beneficial here.\n\n*Progressive overload for overhead pressing movements -* It's notoriously difficult to progress in overhead pressing movements with calisthenics\/bodyweight training. First off, the point of entry for pike push ups is incredibly high, and secondly handstand push ups require a massive skill component. Pretty much every high level calisthenics coach online is in agreeance that working the strength and skill component of a handstand push up simultaneously is conducive to reliable progression. The fact that kettlebell weights are scalable down to the single kilogram will certainly help build towards the pike push up, and further progress strength when bridging the gap between a pike push up and handstand push up. I have also found, as the kettlebell sits on the outside of the arm, when performed with the right technique (external shoulder rotation, elbows kept to the front of the body as opposed to coming out sideways) the kettlebell press is quite reflective of the movement in a pike\/handstand push up.\n\n*Greater grip strength -* Something I have found in my own training, which may not be reflective of others, is that my grip strength increased hugely when using kettlebells. Something about stopping the bell flying away from you whilst using a more hook-like grip while performing heavy single arm swings is far more conducive to increasing forearm strength than simply hanging from a bar.\n\n*Explosive (or 'ballistic') strength in the hips -* Upper body explosive strength is easily trainable in calisthenics\/bodyweight systems - muscle ups, clapping push ups, and various other exercises offer a great way to train this. Explosive lower body training with calisthenics\/bodyweight however offers a single exercise - jumping squats. The hips connect all the largest muscle groups in the body, and can generate the most strength through their movement, therefore training heavy swings and other such 'ballistic' hinging movements will teach you how to generate the most force or power, and has huge carry over to a plethora of real world and sports applications.\n\n*Cardio, cardio, cardio -* another sadly neglected part of calisthenics\/bodyweight training is cardio. Almost all kettlebell programs include an element of high intensity cardio, via the way of complexes, EMOMs, etc. Whilst this can be replicated through things like sprints, the additional quality of full body coordination whilst experiencing aerobic fatigue can have huge benefits for overall health, health span, and carry over to sports.\n\n**For both:**\n\n*A greater exercise selection -* without bogging yourself down in 'paralysis by over analysis', in which you fret mindlessly about the most effective exercise for the specific adaptation, or switch up exercises so frequently that you miss focussed work towards progression; having a greater exercise selection is great in circumstances where you are plateauing in specific movement patterns. Stopped progressing in your push up movements? Switch to floor press for your next mesocycle. Kettlebell rows not hitting like they used to? Try inverted rows. Having a larger selection of exercises can also be incredibly helpful in working around injuries, for example, when i had a shoulder tendinopathy and I couldn't press overhead at all, Turkish get ups came to the rescue, and allowed me to maintain my overhead pressing strength completely whilst the injury healed.\n\n*Mobility training -* It can't be overstated how important having large active ranges of motion are over the course of our life and health span. The options offered by loaded mobility training can be woven into most programs, and having access to strength within larger rages of motion will also open up a whole new world of skills in calisthenics.\n\n*Unilateral training* \\- Something both modalities offer is unilateral training. As previously mentioned, we are not perfect beings, and having more coordination and strength when off balance can be life changing. Upper body calisthenics movements such as archer or single arm push\/pull progressions, plus single kettebell loaded exercises such as single kettebell racked squats or single leg\/single bell RDLs will teach you to better control your spine\/core when off balance, reaping huge real world benefits.\n\n***To conclude, It's fair to say that Calisthenics is an INCOMPLETE training modality. It's impossible to progressively overload certain movement patterns (i.e. lower body) to the same extent as others (i.e. upper body). Saying this, ALL calisthenics athletes should consider some form of weight training. I'm not saying kettlebells are the best answer here (it's wholly dependent on goals), but they could certainly be the most convenient or accessible. And a final point for Kettlebell athletes, it's worth considering the unique benefits that calisthenics offer in terms of upper body strength, connective tissue health, and your relative strength-to-bodyweight ratio.***\n\n***How can you train both modalities simultaneously?***\n\nA main way I am going to differ from [u\/Prowland12](https:\/\/new.reddit.com\/user\/Prowland12\/) post is I am not going to give you examples of how to structure your training. This is for two reasons - this type of training is highly specialised, and require a depth of knowledge that would require mountains of information being dumped into a single post, and I would like to keep this fairly concise (but please message me if you would like some specifics!). Second, each person has different goals and can allocate different amounts of time to each goal. The average teenager with no responsibilities is going to have much more time to dedicate to training than the average adult with kids and a full time job, plus everyones program will look completely different depending on their goals. It just feels counter productive to say, 'here is an exact programming method you can follow which will help you reach your goals' - progression is never linear in this fashion, and I feel we should all take it upon ourselves to be experimenters with our own body.\n\nAll that said, here are my main tips -\n\n*Choose your goals wisely -* As combining the two modalities can cause conflicts in goals, it's best to choose fewer overall long term training aims. A good guide for a beginner would be to choose a single goal within each of the 4 main movement patters, i.e. 1 push, 1 pull, 1 squat, and 1 hinge goal. Conflicting goals are ones where the adaptations desired perhaps doesn't work towards the same end result - i.e. going for the planche will mean a whole lot of horizontal pushing work, so simultaneously trying to PB your overhead press might be conflicting, or trying to grow mass your legs whilst going for the front lever might extend the time it takes to achieve the front lever. Organising workouts to priorities the exercises that work towards your most desired goals will be really important here.\n\n*Exercise order matters* \\- understanding the effect of local muscle fatigue, and central nervous system fatigue during a single bout of exercise is key to programming for specific goals. Exercises placed later in the workout will be more difficult to progress due to the accumulated fatigue, so understanding how your body might react to certain periodisation methodologies is key to attaining long term goals\n\n*Getting enough practice in -* When we talk about acquiring skills, frequency is the most important factor. Acquiring skills encompasses the ability to perform that skill safely, which should always be a priority when learning a new exercise. Getting enough frequency in a single movement pattern can be challenging when spreading your practice out over 2 modalities with multitudes of fundamental movements, after all, we only have a certain capacity for recovery, so it's stupid to think we can learn all the movement patterns and skills of even a single modality at the same time. Train smart - don't try take on too many skills at once. Especially when it comes to kettlebell training, learn to master one at a time and you will see much better long term development and SAFER practice.\n\n*Step Loading* \\- A form of progressive overload seen in both kettlebell and calisthenics\/bodyweight training that relies on increases in volume prior to increases in intensity. It's great that this is seen across both modalities, as it allows for very similar structure to progressive overload between exercises in each modality, and can make structuring your programming much easier.\n\n*Full body workouts -* Full body workouts can be an effective way to get frequent practice, however due to the fatigue generated over a single bout, are not great for long term development. Progress will stagnate over time due to not being able to get enough volume\/stimulation in a single movement pattern\/muscle group as your body adapts over time. It's also with considering the interference effect, in which certain adaptations can blunt others if performed in a single bout of exercise. Hence why, once you are out of the beginner stage and are proficient at the basic skills and movement patters, it may be a good idea to move on to...\n\n*Concurrent training* \\- This programming methodology relies on seeking specific adaptations on separate days through a micro\/mesocycle. This could be set up as such over 4 days of training in a 7 day microcycle (note, this is my current programming!) - Day 1 - upper body strength focus, day 2 rest, day 3 full body cardio\/endurance focus, day 4 rest, day 5 Upper body strength focus, day 6 lower body strength focus, day 7 rest.\n\n*Change your technique to reflect your goals -* (I feel like this might be controversial to the purists out there). Much like i described with the overhead press earlier in the post, technique can be changed to better suite goals. First, It's important to distinguish the differences between FORM and TECHNIQUE. Form is a non-negotiable aspect of any exercise; it outlines the safest way to perform any given exercise, e.g. for a kettlebell swing, hinging not squatting, neutral spine, head and neck neutral, etc. Technique on the the other hand changes the movement pattern with the intension of emphasising a certain adaptation gained from the exercise without compromising form. For a kettlebell swing, this could be something as little as a wider stance, to something more unusual as adding a hard scapula retraction at the top of the movement to get more back 'gains'. I use this all over the place in conjugation with my training goals, and will be happy to share some specifics.\n\n**I hope you enjoyed this post!

Not all exercises are covered, but this is the best starting point I have found. \n\n# Benefits of Kettlebells for Calisthenics\n\n1. **Strength & Hypertrophy**\n   1. Compound Movements\n      1. Kettlebells can address gaps left behind in calisthenics training, such as the hip hinge, squat, and row. \n   2. Isolation Movements\n      1. Kettlebells can be used for isolation movements, similar to how a dumbell is used. There are even specific kettlebell isolation exercises that take advantage of the shape of the kettlebell. Example: [https:\/\/youtu.be\/AED9Mf0KCEI](https:\/\/youtu.be\/AED9Mf0KCEI) \n   3. Grip & Core Strength \n      1. Most kettlebell exercises will stimulate your grip and core, which has immediate carryover to your bodyweight training. \n2. **Explosive Power & Endurance**\n   1. Kettlebell ballistic movements such as the snatch, clean & jerk, and swing allow you to develop explosive power while also training for muscular endurance and improving your cardiovascular fitness. The same exercise can be programmed to develop either quality, or a blend of both, depending on volume and intensity. \n3. **Stability & Mobility** \n   1. Many kettlebell exercises have a large stability component, training the muscles of your hips, core, shoulders, and wrists to safely handle unstable loads. \n   2. Kettlebell exercises also often have a large range of motion, helping you to become more strong and mobile. \n4. **Convenience & Portability** \n   1. Kettlebells are space-efficient and easily portable. You can store them in a closet, corner of a room, or underneath a bed.  Like gymnastic rings and bands, kettlebells can also easily be packed into a car and taken on road-trips, to outdoor locations, etc. They can be secured using a standard seatbelt to prevent them from moving around; [https:\/\/youtu.be\/rRfn2Uql4\\_k](https:\/\/youtu.be\/rRfn2Uql4_k) \n   2. You also only need a few different weights of kettlebells (2-3) to reap the full benefits, unlike barbells that need many plates and dumbbells that come in small weight increments. This means you can have a fairly cost-effective setup compared to barbells or dumbbells, plus you do not need to invest in racks or storage equipment that can add additional cost and take up more space.\n\n# Categorizing Kettlebell Exercises \n\nKettlebells are often broken down into what is called ballistics and grinds. Ballistics are explosive, momentum-based movements such as the kettlebell swing, snatch, or clean & jerk. Grinds are everything else, including exercises like the goblet squat or turkish get up. I think the category of grinds is too broad to be useful, as the exercises included can be very different. \n\nInstead, I break kettlebell exercises down into 4 general categories, with several common examples listed for each. \n\n* **Ballistics**\n   * Explosive movements using momentum. Either trained for low reps (focus on explosive strength) or moderate to high reps (focus on endurance). Single kettlebell variations are easier than double kettlebell variations. \n   * Beginner\n      * Kettlebell Swing: [https:\/\/youtu.be\/1cVT3ee9mgU](https:\/\/youtu.be\/1cVT3ee9mgU) \n   * Intermediate\n      * Kettlebell Clean: [https:\/\/youtu.be\/C0B1SrcGAIA](https:\/\/youtu.be\/C0B1SrcGAIA)\n      * Kettlebell High Pull: [https:\/\/youtu.be\/OkLpueSAKrY](https:\/\/youtu.be\/OkLpueSAKrY) \n      * Kettlebell Half Snatch: [https:\/\/youtu.be\/iVaFwCBP1GM](https:\/\/youtu.be\/iVaFwCBP1GM)\n   * Advanced \n      * Kettlebell Jerk: [https:\/\/youtu.be\/GO50lAyPsVw](https:\/\/youtu.be\/GO50lAyPsVw) \n      * Kettlebell Long Cycle (Clean and Jerk): [https:\/\/youtu.be\/Jee68mMes2Q](https:\/\/youtu.be\/Jee68mMes2Q) \n      * Kettlebell Snatch: [https:\/\/youtu.be\/6SvawOLVTbo](https:\/\/youtu.be\/6SvawOLVTbo) \n* **High-Skill Exercises**\n   * Exercises that require a high degree of mobility and coordination.

Compensate for this by training unilateral variations and\/or doing longer loaded carries (more time). Shortening rest time is another option. \n   * [https:\/\/youtu.be\/LLCwJWE67aU](https:\/\/youtu.be\/LLCwJWE67aU) \n* **Strength Exercises**\n   * Typical strength training exercises you would see in any gym.

Thankfully, the versatility of kettlebells means you can get away with only using 2-3 different sized kettlebells. Do not worry about getting too many, just get one that is a good size. \n   * Start with 1 kettlebell at a weight that you'd consider \"intermediate\"and base other kettlebells off of that standard. This may change over time as you become stronger. \n   * I recommend testing out different weights of kettlebells at a gym or store before deciding which size to buy. It is not very easy to guess without any experience. \n* There are also some **adjustable kettlebell options**\n   * Example: [https:\/\/www.bellsofsteel.us\/all-products\/conditioning\/kettlebells\/adjustable-kettlebell\/](https:\/\/www.bellsofsteel.us\/all-products\/conditioning\/kettlebells\/adjustable-kettlebell\/) \n   * This is an inexpensive way to have many different loading options, and load the kettlebell in smaller increments. \n   * There are magnetic micro-plates that can be attached to a kettlebell for loading in smaller increments. They are very easy to use, but not very cost-effective.  \n\n***Which type of kettlebell?***\n\nKettlebells fall into 2 different broad types, *hard-style* and *competition*. Both are excellent and mostly interchangeable, they just have a few key differences.\n\n**Hardstyle**\n\n* **Pros**\n   * Larger handles, making it easier to hold with two hands. This may be more comfortable for people with large hands and wrists. \n   * Well-designed for single kettlebell exercises, okay at double kettlebell exercises. If you are planning to train only using a single kettlebell, the hardstyle kettlebell is a bit more versatile.\n   * Heavier maximum weight. Some hardstyle bells can exceed 90 kg (198 lbs).  So if you are extremely strong with kettlebells, hardstyle bells give you more options for heavy single bell exercises.  \n* **Cons**\n   * Size of kettlebells varies depending on the weight. Beyond a certain point, hardstyle kettlebells can become very bulky and unmanageable, depending on how large your body is. This is usually a problem only at higher weights like 32 kg+ (70 lbs+). \n   * The wider handle makes it easier to smack your forearms with certain ballistic exercises. It feels very unpleasant and can bruise your arms slightly. \n\n**Competition**\n\n* **Pros**\n   * Smaller handles, making it easier to hold with one hand. These are very well-designed for holding a kettlebell in the rack position and balistic exercises like cleans and snatches, as those are the kettlebell competition movements. \n   * Well-designed for double kettlebell exercises.\n   * Small handles make it a bit harder to hold with two hands.  \n   * Uniform size of kettlebells, regardless of the weight. This means no issues with kettlebells being too bulky at 32 kg+.\n* **Cons** \n   * Smaller handles make it harder to hold with two hands, making it less versatile. \n   * Competition kettlebells only go up to 48 kg (106 lbs). Realistically, this is only a problem for athletes who are very strong. \n\n***Single or pair of kettlebells?*** \n\nSingle kettlebell exercises are quite popular and effective. It is entirely possible to reap the benefits of kettlebells while only doing single kettlebell variations. However, pairs of dumbbells allow you to use much higher loads, and are far more stimulating. They are great for maximizing strength and hypertrophy with kettlebells.\n\nI personally recommend getting a matching pair of moderate weight kettlebells rather than getting a really heavy single kettlebell. You will get more use out of a pair of 20 kg (44 lb) kettlebells than a single 40 kg (88 lb) kettlebell, for example. \n\n***Kettlebells of different weights?***\n\nA helpful compromise if you have several kettlebells, but no matching pairs, is to train mixed grip and anyhow grip exercises (see below). \n\n***Using kettlebells if you're very strong?***\n\nA rule of thumb for estimating how heavy your kettlebells need to be is by having each kettlebell be a third of the total weight of the barbell equivalent. Example: You can barbell front squat 150 kg (330 lbs), so with one kettlebell you can do a 48 kg (106 lb) goblet squat, or with a pair of kettlebells you can do a front rack squat with two 48 kg kettlebell (106 lbs each). \n\nIf you are fairly advanced in strength, such as a person who can easily deadlift 200+ kg (440+ lbs), then you're going to need to make a few modifications to continue to be challenged. Luckily, you can often use more than one of these options at the same time. Training with double kettlebells is going to be necessary. \n\n* **Option 1: Exercise Variations with More Challenging Leverage**\n   * Switch from training exercise variations that are very easy for you, such as a standard kettlebell  DL to a single leg DL . \n* **Option 2: Use of Bands and Weight Vests**\n   * See below for an explanation on how to add load with weight vests and heavy bands. \n* **Option 3: Holding More than One Kettlebell Per Hand** \n   * If you have a strong grip and are able to hold them both comfortably, you can hold two kettlebells in one hand for extra load. \n   * Example: [https:\/\/youtu.be\/OKyQGP7IDV4](https:\/\/youtu.be\/OKyQGP7IDV4)\n\n***Ways to grip the kettlebell?***\n\n**Standard** \n\n* Goblet \n   * An easy grip close to your center of gravity. Cannot be loaded to one side.\n* Suitcase\n   * Good for working with heavy weights and\/or pulling movements.  Can be loaded to one side.\n* Rack\n   * A more challenging way to hold the kettlebell than the goblet. Can be loaded to one side. \n\n**Situational** \n\n* Anyhow\/Mixed Grip \n   * A mixed grip using two different positions. Useful if you have two kettlebells that are different weights. In most cases, put the heavier kettlebell at the bottom position.\n   * [https:\/\/youtu.be\/6Wxeurtw1yk](https:\/\/youtu.be\/6Wxeurtw1yk) \n   * Mixed: [https:\/\/youtube.com\/shorts\/Y0kjkTkGPjk?feature=share](https:\/\/youtube.com\/shorts\/Y0kjkTkGPjk?feature=share) \n* Bottoms Up \n   * The \"ball\" of the kettlebell is further away from you, making the exercise more challenging and harder to stabilize. \n* Behind The Head \n   * Useful for replicating rear-loaded movements, such as the back squat or good morning. \n* Overhead \n   * Good for training overhead stability and mobility.\n* Shoulder \n   * A position similar to the rack position, but often easier. Similar to loading in a fireman's carry.\n\n***How to combine kettlebells with other equipment?***\n\n* **Resistance Bands:** [https:\/\/youtu.be\/Z77pGde9GjM](https:\/\/youtu.be\/Z77pGde9GjM) \n   * Resistance bands are very convenient and can be used to add intermediate load between different kettlebell sizes. They can also change resistance curves for an added challenge. \n   * Strong bands are great for making exercises like kettlebell deadlifts challenging enough to be comparable to barbell equivalents. If you're a very strong deadlifter and\/or squatter, it may be more practical (and far cheaper) to invest in heavy bands than to try and acquire very heavy and bulky kettlebells. \n* **Weight Vests** \n   * Another way to add some extra load. Good for calisthenics kettlebell variations as well as lower body exercises like squats and burpees. These are more situational than resistance bands, but also allow you to keep your hands free. \n* **Dip Belt**\n   * Kettlebells are great as an alternative to weight plates for adding load to dip belts. \n   * [https:\/\/youtu.be\/XZLomCan-0U](https:\/\/youtu.be\/XZLomCan-0U) \n\n# Programming \n\nHere are some example templates of what a hybrid kettlebell\/calisthenics program might look like. \n\n**BEGINNER** \n\n**Strength\/Hypertrophy Workout (Beginner)** \n\nA standard strength program.

I also started getting back into lifting in January for more all-round strength (deadlifts, squats, bench). \n\nI feel like I've regressed tremendously since. I'm still training consistently, 2-3 times a week like I was before overtraining it to the point of injury. I don't feel any regression in strength, and my shoulder is definitely much stronger and more stable now than before, but for whatever reason I can't make any of my holds stick and I feel like I'm back where I was 2 years ago. The only noticeable difference is a much more open tuck handstand, which is probably from tighter hips since I started squatting again. \n\nHas anyone experienced this\/ had to deal with something similar? My practice for the last 3 months has been 90% falling out of handstands and it's becoming incredibly frustrating, and I'd love to get out of whatever this is.\n\nIf this is relevant, I've gained weight since lifting from trying to increase my protein intake, but not significantly enough that I think it'd affect my balance (~3kg).","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678365540.0},{"title":"Should hip flexors be trained on the same day as the rest of core?","author":"Flimsy-Incident-1545","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/bodyweightfitness\/comments\/11ly7el\/should_hip_flexors_be_trained_on_the_same_day_as\/","text":"Hi guys, I have a question regarding the programming of exercises for my workouts.

When I started doing BW exercises 7 months ago, I could not even do 2 pushups. I started with pushups on my knees, and eventually worked my way up to 3\u00d712 sets after almost 2 months. I continued to progress by elevating my feet to increase weight of the press, from a couple inches up until I was able to elevate my feet just over 12 inches and complete 5\u00d715. When I reached this level, I wanted to increase the lifting amount more, but didn't feel ready to tackle a steeper decline, so I purchased a 20lb vest. I started with lower reps than without the vest. And was quickly able to reach 5\u00d715 with the vest. So I decided to increase the decline by elevating my feet higher again. I went from 5\u00d715 with vest and feet elevated 12in, to 5\u00d75 with vest and feet elevated 24in. I've now worked my way up to 5\u00d710-12 with vest and 24in elevation, and then I do 5\u00d712 without the vest and feet still elevated 24in.

It takes me about an hour to do all this, with rest ranging from about a minute to 5 minutes in between each set. \n\nJump jacks 3\u00d730\n\nLeg raises 3\u00d78 \n\nDiamond Push ups 3\u00d78\n\nNegative Pull ups 3\u00d75 \n\nSquats 3\u00d712\n\nPlyometric lunges 3\u00d716\n\nDips 3\u00d75\n\nPlank 3\u00d730s\n\nHigh knees 3\u00d730s\n\nPush up sideways, i don't know what you call them but you turn your body around in a side plank like position after every rep. 3\u00d710\n\nSide planks, left and right, 2\u00d730s\n\n....\n\nI'm 21, 5'6 or 5'7 and weight 78kgs, the lowest I've been is 75. I lost weight once, from about 88 to 75, then once again gained it, got to 84 and am back to 78 right now. \n\nThis time though, i know I've gained more muscles than before and I'm obviously much stronger as well. I've been thinking of substituting diamond pushups with clapping push ups or a higher progression, leg raises with hanging leg raises or knee raises in case i can't do those. \n \nAdditionally i also practice handstands almost everyday, currently doing about 5 sets of 45 degrees wall planks, holding for 30 seconds.","upvote_ratio":0.69,"created_utc":1678086909.0},{"title":"Why do so many people do pushups with elbows flared out?","author":"Alarming-Low-8076","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/bodyweightfitness\/comments\/11io0w2\/why_do_so_many_people_do_pushups_with_elbows\/","text":"I would love if someone knows the history behind pushup form if they could explain to me why so many do it with the elbows flared out (70-90 degrees). Keeping the elbows in closer to the body (45 degrees-ish or closer) was one of the first form things I learned about the standard pushups, so I tend to cringe when I see people trying for the standard pushup and their elbows flare out.\n\nI'm not even talking about untrained individuals here or even mildly trained individuals. I do see it here but I don't cringe so hard then because whatever, it's awesome they're even attempting pushups.  I'm sure when I was a complete beginner, I also tried it this way.\n\nBut I feel like I see it all the time from people\/video examples that should likely know the form?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor instance, today I saw it from the FBI's physical fitness requirements video (I was curious about their fitness test), and Hybrid Calisthenics in a recent video used a stock video with someone doing the flared elbow technique.\n\nBut beyond that, I've also seen it from some fitness influencers on Instagram that show up in my reels, and  I'm pretty sure I saw someone on the Physical 100 doing it (tho it may have been a one handed pushup so may not be the best example)\n\nI've mostly seen women doing it, but I'm sure I've seen men doing it as well, just not quite as often. Maybe it's a testament to the fitness world only recently starting to be more inclusive to women. But I don't know. It could be a strength thing but then that only explains the beginners which I'm not as questioning about.\n\nSo, my question is why? Especially for those that clearly have the strength to do pushups with elbows closer to body. Or maybe it's not as important of a technique as I thought?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCurious to hear what everyone thinks\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit:\n\nThis post got a lot of comments while I was asleep so thank you for the input, everyone. I wasn't expecting this to be quite as controversial because I thought people here would agree on what the standard pushup form is, and from everything I had learned is that in the standard pushup (ie hands still close to you) if you have your elbows flare it will be bad for the shoulders.\n\nBut I've also learned a lot here, and there's a lot of good points. I know pushup variations and different forms. I would typically use a wide pushup if I wanted more chest activation, but if someone can get the chest activation via the standard width pushup with flared elbows and they don't feel it's compromising their shoulders, than who am I to say it's wrong. I do recognize that every body is different and we'll feel different pressure points in different places in different forms. And if someone's goal is simply to do as many reps or as much weight as they can, then it's easier to do the flared elbow method.\n\nI've only been working out for 2 years, so yes, in my time I've only seen it taught the elbows tucked in as the preferred method (not counting pushup variations beyond the standard),so I didn't know the history and didn't know that certain places like the military don't really teach it or didn't or preferred to have as many reps as possible which you may have to start compromising form on. \n\nso thanks.

The third day is a total of 5 ladders, stopping before failure.\n\nSo for example, training day 1, 10\/10\/10 pullups, training day 2, 5\/5\/5\/5\/5\/5\/5\/5\/5\/5 pullups, training day 3 is 5 ladders (each step is the total reps, so a ladder that goes to 5 will have 1+2+3+4+5= 15 reps total for that ladder, and doing 5 ladders each training day): ladder 1 (1+2+3+4+5) ladder 2 (1+2+3+4+5) ladder 3 ((1+2+3+4+5) ladder 4 (1+2+3+4+5) ladder 5 (1+2+3+4+5).

If point my toes out to the sides instead, the tightness is gone and i can squat deeper. I have a feeling this is the issue but have no idea what drills to do or how to progress. Any tips ?\n\nEdit: for anyone else struggling and reading the comments for tips; a few commenters mentioned holding a dumbbell out in front of me as a counter weight. Tried that today and got my first 2 reps flat footed on each leg. Looks like the next step is to improve the ankle mobility\/dorsiflexion as suggested by a few of you so that i can do it without any assistance.

I can certainly do that, but I'd like to save some time here. \n\nThe question I've had the most difficulty in answering is how best these should be integrated into a normal routine? Should they be done before, during, or after working a major muscle group? \n\nFor example: If I plan on working the deltoid, I should probably also strengthen the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor, etc. Should I work those stabilizing\/support muscles before, during, after, or on another day altogether from the deltoid workout? \n\nMy intuition tells me that if my goal is strengthening the support muscles, then the general principal is to exhaust the deltoid before trying to isolate the infraspinatus, so that the deltoid is engaging less and the infraspinatus is taking on more of the burden, but I'm certainly no expert or well enough informed. \n\nFinally, I'm wondering if this is even worth considering? Will regular training within the RR or BWSF eventually provide enough strength in those support muscles that it's not really a concern? \n\nI can go into specifics, but I'm really trying to nail down some general principals here instead of trying to diagnose a single issue.

Sort of. Well, really the Old School was right. Allow me to explain. In our relentless pursuit of strength, it can become easy to forget that an impressive maximum weight pullup or planche is **not** the only important facet of fitness. As the functional fitness community once astutely pointed out, are you really fit if you can't express strength in a variety of situations?\n\nThe reality is that most activities of daily living, athletic endeavors, and strenuous physical jobs are hybrid activities, requiring a blend of various strength qualities. A soldier's 1 rep bench press is not assessed because it does not determine their readiness for the rigors of combat, nor does a footballer's max back squat determine if they have the leg stamina to withstand 90 minutes of intense play. Imagine a rock climber with an iron-strong grip that only lasts 10 seconds, or a swimmer with bulging lats that vomits as soon as their upper body muscles are flooded with lactic acid. What about a sprinter with strong legs that can't run fast? Or a ballerina who is only able to lift their leg up to hip height? This sort of dysfunction may seem ridiculous, but it's the exact sort of problem that can arise from training without variety and purpose. \n\n**Stuck at Step 1**\n\nI see many people's approach to strength training as boiling down to this.\n\n1. Get strong.\n2. ????\n3. Profit.\n\nAsk yourself, how much of your hard-earned strength can you really translate outside of a 1 or 5 rep max? Can you translate that strength into explosive force? Can you use your strength over a long period of time? Can you use your strength in extreme ranges of motion? Can you rely on your joints and tendons to handle the load you are putting on your muscles? Can you confidently say you're doing everything possible to perform better? Are you even coordinated enough to pull off the skills you want to accomplish?\n\nWhy are we only emphasizing one part of the equation? Is it not apparent, nay, obvious that (at least some of) our training should be be devoted to becoming a more well-rounded athlete?  We know, logically, that our bodies adapt only to the specific stimulus we expose them to. Yet our current paradigm leads us to pigeon-hole ourselves into the pursuit of maximal strength at the expense of all other athletic qualities.\n\n**Learning From The Old School Paradigm**\n\nThis is where I circle back to what I mean by the Old School. I consider the old school \"method\" as being military and prison-style workouts, the use of extremely minimal or no equipment, technical mastery of simple movements and focus on quality over quantity. Examples of this are the YouTuber Iron Wolf [https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/@IronWolf84](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/@IronWolf84) or good old Al Kavadlo [https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/@alkavadlo\/featured](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/@alkavadlo\/featured) \n\nThe old school has fallen out of style, for various reasons. I was fortunate to be exposed to the basic tenets of it during my first days at the gym as a kid, as my father showed me the merits of high repetition chinups, dips, leg raises, russian twists, and pushups. My first days of learning about calisthenics and training were also during the brief time on social media before online fitness trends became much more homogenous and heavily commercialized. Had I not had a fit parent who was of an older generation and also stumbled into some dusty corners of the internet, it is unlikely I would have ever seen this other way of looking at things.\n\nThe key takeaway was that I wasn't just training to get stronger. I was training to get *better.* I did not want to just have strong muscles, I wanted to *master* the movements. I wanted to be able to do pullups in my sleep, still have a picture-perfect leg raise at the end of a hard workout, and have no problem dropping and doing a few sets of crisp explosive pushups whenever I felt the need to.\n\n**A Mastery-Based Approach**\n\nWhen we look at the most accomplished athletes in the world, most of what they are doing is still just the basics. A 9 year old in a basketball rec league and Lebron James both have to dribble, pass, and shoot a ball. The difference is that Lebron James is orders of magnitude *better* at these movements. He has put in the time and effort to train his nervous system for maximum efficiency.\n\nStrength can be viewed the same way. It is not just the ability to produce force. It is an indication of neurological efficiency, a measure of *skill.* If you want to really progress beyond the beginner-intermediate level, train for years and avoid stupid injuries, absorb this idea. Focus on your goals, raise your standards for your training over time, build a strong athletic foundation, and attack your weakpoints in technique, mobility, endurance, power, etc. \n\nNow go out and do your best!","upvote_ratio":0.91,"created_utc":1677754103.0},{"title":"r\/BWF - Daily Discussion Thread for March 03, 2023","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/bodyweightfitness\/comments\/11h50kk\/rbwf_daily_discussion_thread_for_march_03_2023\/","text":"Welcome to the [r\/bodyweightfitness](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/bodyweightfitness\/) Daily Discussion thread!\n\nThis is the place to post simple questions, anecdotes, achievements, or just about anything that's on your mind related to fitness!\n\n**Reminders:**\n\n* Read the [FAQ](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/bodyweightfitness\/wiki\/faq) as your question may be answered there already.\n* Our two main beginner routines are the [BWF Primer Routine](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/bodyweightfitness\/comments\/kofo8l\/bwf_primer_buildup_community_event_day_1_happy\/) and the [Bodyweight Strength Foundation (BWSF) Routine](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/bodyweightfitness\/wiki\/routines\/bwsf\/).

Leg day is anything but enjoyable for me, and I tried different ways to make it more tolerable. At the moment I am doing a simple 3 exercises routine being: squats - glute bridges - calf raises.\n\nMy main problem with this routine is the squats, I am wearing a 30kg weight vest to add some intensity, but I still need to do 20+ squats per sets and I quickly end up doing more cardio than strength\/volume. Also the weight vest (which is my only way to add weights atm) is quite uncomfortable for breathing during long exercises, adding more troubles.\n\nSo here is where I need some insight from you guys. I think what I need is to change my leg to be more fun and enjoyable otherwise I will go insane. I've seen a lot of people here recommending sprints and hill sprints to train the legs, and this seems very fun to me. The thing is that I already do running as cardio 3-4 times\/week, and I am not an advanced runner, so I am worried that adding sprints between the cardio days will lead to not enough rest for my legs.\n\nI'd also like to train all parts of my legs, and I am quite ignorant about what parts of the legs sprinting trains besides the quads. Is sprinting enough on its own to train all parts of the legs? If not what would you suggest to compliment sprinting ?\n\nAnd if you have fun exercises suggestions for the legs I'd be happy to read them !\n\nThank you !","upvote_ratio":0.87,"created_utc":1677776512.0},{"title":"laying side leg lifts","author":"plantsandfish11","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/bodyweightfitness\/comments\/11gfvml\/laying_side_leg_lifts\/","text":"I'm a total fitness beginner, 5'1\" woman, been introducing some bodyweight routine over the past few weeks and feeling pretty good about it.

I'm a small build man, early 40s, and not really athletic. Best in my life was probably mid to late 20s where I was a competitive dancer. I started to become very interesting in body weight fitness perhaps augmented recently. I did parts of the RR for a while, and at one point (I think mid 30s) I was able to do max about 5 chin-ups while holding a L-sit position (so like a hanging leg raise) for example but never really got there on any serious \"elements\". \n\nI have a desk job, sit a lot, and after some injury and bad habits, and of course time not keeping up with it, I've lost a lot of strength. I'm not worried about this, I know all that will come back and I'm trying to forge now a plan that I can always return to.\n\nAt the moment, I wanted some comments on my current approach as well as some questions that while I'm sure others have asked, I can't find in the following form:\n\n(1) TL;DR: *I find GTG very easy to work but am unsure how to push to failure* I like GTG\/volume training because I use this to just break up the sitting needed in my job. I recovered back to being able to do 1-3 chin-ups (non-raised) sets of 8-10 slow push-ups (focus on form), some diamond push-ups, Bulgarian leg squats, etc all pretty easy, but couldn't fully develop L-sit, assisted pistol etc. Rarely during this time did I serious \"worked out\" in the usual sense of pushing to absolute failure.  I then backslide again, but I know how to build back to that level pretty easily. Basically, I did it by working out as much as possible while doing my job. I got up to nearly hundreds of tracked exercises per week (not much but it did the job for me and better than 0).\n\n(2) *How to balance training to failure versus volume* I wanted to hit the 80\/20 rule here of effectivity (do the thing that make 80% of the results first -- not sure how understandable that is, but its a principle when starting new things to be effective). I understand the hypotrophic (roughly failure at 5-6 reps, everyone is different) versus endurance ranges and my goals are mostly at the latter (especially for core movements) but everyone wants to look better in the mirror. My expectation is I'm still so deep in the newbie gain territory, nothing here really matters -- muscle will build. However, I want to build good habits. \n\nEven if one is volume training (increase max reps per set, reps per week etc) so building endurance and strength, every so often one should work in the hypotrophic range too; every now and again, its good to work out at small numbers reps to failure.  This is harder to do body weight, mostly because one can't as easily target specific groups. **Q:** What are the guild lines\/best practice helpful to keep in mind? Pushing to failure versus volume training seem like different goals, but can they and does one make them \"work together\"?\n\n(3) *Current plan*: I'm taking a week, working out semi-frequently to GTG and start back up. Sometimes, I'll push to failure, but rarely. I'm focusing on hanging progressions (working back up to a pull-up): negatives, and ~~not sure the name, but pulling-up as far as one can with the back and shoulders to build strength in those groups (so hanging contractions?)~~ scapular contractions, desk rows, push-ups, dips, split-squats, hanging and seated leg raises, hanging knee-tucks with and without rotations, weighted carries (pick up a heavy thing and walk down the hall), and primal movements when possible (I have toddlers, it is often possible). Among these, I'm going for volume and frequency for now. Once I can do 8 full reps per set, for 3 sets with small rest and good form (e.g., push-ups I push all the way through the back and go slow at first), then I want to up the progression or intensity. If I had any elements to work on, it would be to get those L-sits (at least hanging), chin-ups (if that counts as an element -- its something I can't do), and (assisted) pistols (such a dream). *Q:* Are there more elements that I should start building towards? I've tried every surface in my house to try to add hinge movements (nordic curls) too, I may re-arrange furniture. *Q:* Other than perhaps recording the total number of reps and maxes, how does one notate this\/keep track for progress? I don't want to list every exercise, doing hanging shoulder contractions on the bar seems to not count the same as say a full chin-up (which I can do at the moment -- the one -- and then one again -- I'll get there). Any advice also moving from chin up to pull-up is helpful though I think I know the standard answer. Train the negative, use bands, etc until its there.  **EDIT:** I think my elbow position is killing me here. I'm using too much arm and not enough back. My door frame is a bit narrow for the over hand and my arms hit the frame (hence going forward). For underhand position, I'm guessing it is still keeping elbows back in order to activate more the back muscles? \n\nIn this progression, I'm working for now as indicated for volume. **Q:**Are there pushing to failure types of work outs, at this stage, that would be meaningfully helpful? I'm happy to add weights or gym time to help augment, but again, I'm trying to go more for just the most effective things first. I also don't want to encourage injury and it seems safer to push to failure in controlled more isolated movements (and with adjustable weight so as to just get there).\n\n(4) *fasting:* I understand the basic physics, caloric surplus (mild and correct stuff) is needed to build muscle, IF\/EF is for cutting (roughly) and there are various HGH boosts at times for this. I had no trouble keeping up volume etc while fasting (I'm an experienced faster). In these phases, I eat pretty normally (lunch and dinner -- no snacking outside) and the usual stuff (chicken, broccoli, brown rice etc) but I don't count specific caloric amounts much (I'm not sure I do them right). I'm not worried about over eating at the moment. I'm more focusing on making sure I eat extra protein while not over thinking or over stressing and take breaks because life is life. **Q:** What are the \"just don't make these mistakes because you'll waste a lot of time issues\" to be aware of? \n\nI'm treating this go around on exercise more like fasting. I fast at times, and it builds up over time. It also allows me to relax when I'm not fasting. I want to basically work out \"all the time\" so that its always there and not worry about it when I can't for some reason. However, then take really concerted spurts to improve things with focus for long stretches etc. \n\nSorry for the novel, thoughts and advice are helpful!","upvote_ratio":0.5,"created_utc":1677733029.0},{"title":"Month of March 1,000,000 push ups challenge.

As stated, the RR consists of three pairs of exercises and a final core triplet, for a final total of nine different exercises. About 90s of rest is recommended in between each exercise as this results three minutes of rest for the worked muscles, which in turn results in 99% ATP replenishment.\n\nMy question is whether some time could be saved by performing the exercises slightly differently, e.g. instead of three pairs + a triplet with 90s of rest, do it as three triplets with 60s of rest. Would this still allow \\~3 mins of rest between worked muscles for ATP regeneration? If so, this could easily save \\~10 mins per workout.\n\nSince this is not the actual recommendation, and the routine seems to be designed by very knowledgeable people, my guess is that there would be some interference effect such that only 60s of rest in between exercises would not suffice for 99% ATP regeneration, but I would love to hear opinions and thoughts from folks who might have some insight into this.\n\nEdit: Typo.","upvote_ratio":0.85,"created_utc":1677653809.0},{"title":"Quad Training with Calisthenics: A Guide to Lower Body Pressing","author":"Prowland12","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/bodyweightfitness\/comments\/11dzhgo\/quad_training_with_calisthenics_a_guide_to_lower\/","text":"# Intro\n\nIn an attempt to demystify some of the conversation around bodyweight leg training, I have decided to give a brief breakdown about quad training in general, as well as breaking down exercises into meaningful categories. With proper training principles, lower body training with bodyweight can be effective for even advanced trainees. \n\nMy goal is to raise the standard of what can be achieved and expected with bodyweight leg training. \n\n**Guide for Hypertrophy?**\n\nRenaissance Periodization Quad Hypertrophy Guide: [https:\/\/rpstrength.com\/expert-advice\/quad-size-training-tips](https:\/\/rpstrength.com\/expert-advice\/quad-size-training-tips)  Read this to maximize your quad training for muscle mass.\n\n**Explosive Leg Movements?**\n\nI will be including these movements in a separate post, so they will not be covered here.\n\n**Are Loaded Unilateral Movements Still \"Calisthenics\"?**\n\nThe distinction is largely arbitrary for our purposes. The calisthenics vs weights \"debate\" is a result of years of extensive online fitness marketing, not science. \n\n# Key Principles\n\n1. **Range of Motion:** Best results require you to put the quads through a large range of motion. Pause at the bottom and top to maintain control. Work up to this over time, but be gradual. \n2. **Fatigue & Volume:** The muscles of the leg are accustomed to carrying your body around all day. They can (generally) handle a greater training volume than the muscles of your upper body. Volume can make a major difference in leg training results, particularly with bodyweight leg variations. \n   1. You can still develop legs hypertrophy with sets of 20+ repetitions, as made evident by tried and true hypertrophy programs such as the 20 rep squat program [https:\/\/youtu.be\/SUS5bu-CHxw](https:\/\/youtu.be\/SUS5bu-CHxw) \n   2. However, consistent muscle gain requires you to still be training at a high enough intensity *to bring the leg muscles close to failure.* Train your legs to fatigue. \n   3. Consult the Renaissance Periodization article above for more information on this. \n3. **Loading:** The leg muscles are very powerful and it is highly recommended to add external load to keep progressing in strength and hypertrophy. This can also be a way to get stronger on intermediate progressions as you work towards more advanced movements.\n   1. Calisthenics leg pressing without any additional load is **not** going sufficient to maximize leg strength and power. Eventually, additional load must be incorporated for continued strength gains. \n   2. As shown here, advanced single leg squat movements like the pistol squat are only lifting about 88.5% of your body mass: [https:\/\/exrx.net\/WeightTraining\/Bodyweight](https:\/\/exrx.net\/WeightTraining\/Bodyweight) \n      1. While this sounds impressive, the equivalent of a 1.8x bodyweight squat falls in the range of intermediate leg strength. Thankfully, with unilateral leg presses, the use of external resistance can offset this. \n      2. Advanced trainees can lift an impressive amount of additional load with unilateral variations like the split squat: [https:\/\/strengthlevel.com\/strength-standards\/bulgarian-split-squat](https:\/\/strengthlevel.com\/strength-standards\/bulgarian-split-squat)  \n      3. [https:\/\/exrx.net\/Testing\/WeightLifting\/SquatStandards](https:\/\/exrx.net\/Testing\/WeightLifting\/SquatStandards) \n      4. [https:\/\/exrx.net\/Testing\/WeightLifting\/SquatStandardsKg](https:\/\/exrx.net\/Testing\/WeightLifting\/SquatStandardsKg)\n\n# Tools for Leg Training\n\n**Resistance Bands**\n\n* Use resistance bands to improve the resistance curve and as a convenient and portable way to add load. Many bodyweight quad exercises are much less challenging at the top, so a band is a useful tool. If possible, use in combination with other methods.\n   * Foot Plate for more anchoring options\n      * Using a band footplate platform means there is no need to stand directly on the band and provides a lot more options for  using band resistance.\n      * DIY Options\n   * [https:\/\/youtu.be\/y7fyVoTk7IA](https:\/\/youtu.be\/y7fyVoTk7IA)\n   * [https:\/\/youtu.be\/y7fyVoTk7IA](https:\/\/youtu.be\/y7fyVoTk7IA)\n\n**Weight Vests**\n\n* Weight vests are excellent as they do not have to be held, and the weight is very close to your center of gravity. Try to get a vest that has incremental weights for changing load. I recommend getting a vest with a max weight of at least 16 kg\/35 lbs.\n* The main drawback of vests is that they are not very heavy. However, this can be addressed by pairing the weight vest with other methods of adding load, particularly resistance bands. I strongly recommend combining these two to get the benefits of both.\n\n**(Optional) Occlusion Bands**\n\n1. Occlusion or blood-flow restriction (BFR training) is a simple way to increase the difficulty of lower body exercises without having to modify load or leverage. It is a great way to challenge the extremities (legs and arms).\n2. What you are doing is slightly constricting the area right below the hip with an elastic band. This temporary restriction in blood flow to the muscle makes the exercise more fatiguing, as the muscle cannot shuttle out metabolites as effectively. This can be an effective method to induce hypertrophy even while working with very light loads (30% of 1RM).\n   1. Ex: [https:\/\/youtu.be\/OiuvyNgO6r0](https:\/\/youtu.be\/OiuvyNgO6r0)\n   2. Legs will adapt quickly to BFR training, so use it in short training mesocycles or only for part of your lower leg training in a week.\n3. For best results and safety, use elastic BFR bands with a quick-release so you can immediately release the pressure on the muscle when you finish a set.\n   1. [https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Occlusion-BFR-PRO-Restriction-Research-Backed\/dp\/B07613TPVL\/ref=sr\\_1\\_10?crid=2905TGWIJ08ZV&keywords=bfr+band&qid=1676429764&sprefix=bf+%2Caps%2C525&sr=8-10](https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Occlusion-BFR-PRO-Restriction-Research-Backed\/dp\/B07613TPVL\/ref=sr_1_10?crid=2905TGWIJ08ZV&keywords=bfr+band&qid=1676429764&sprefix=bf+%2Caps%2C525&sr=8-10)\n4. **Do not** wear BFR bands for long periods of time. For strength-training, I wouldn't wear them for longer than *1.5-2 minutes* without releasing the pressure. When training multiple sets of an exercise, you are fine to remove the bands between sets and re-wrap your limb when starting the next one.\n5. **Warning:** Use caution when training with occlusion bands, as you are restricting blood flow. Avoid these if you have any relevant health concerns or issues with blood pressure, circulation, etc.\n\n**Kettlebells & Dumbells**\n\nUseful for incrementally progressing weight, can hold 1 or 2 for more options in loading.\n\n1. The main ways to hold kettlebells and dummbells for leg training are the goblet, suitcase, rack, and shoulder loaded holds.\n   1. Goblet\n      1. Holding in front of your body close to your center of gravity. Goblet holds are excellent for getting yourself into a deep squat position.\n      2. [https:\/\/youtu.be\/9W5KAqHfDe8](https:\/\/youtu.be\/9W5KAqHfDe8)\n      3. Double Goblet Variation (Kettlebell Only): [https:\/\/youtu.be\/zyp38sPChQE](https:\/\/youtu.be\/zyp38sPChQE)\n   2. Suitcase\n      1. Holding the dumbell\/kettlebell at your side.\n      2. [https:\/\/youtu.be\/aopAoW1cmUk](https:\/\/youtu.be\/aopAoW1cmUk)\n   3. Rack\n      1.

Shoulder Loaded\n      1. Loading on your shoulders and upper back, use this to replicate a back squat position. For rear loaded exercises, this is how you would add weight.\n      2.

[https:\/\/youtu.be\/jW5D-Krgje](https:\/\/youtu.be\/jW5D-Krgje8)\n\n**Sandbags**\n\nPotentially your heaviest loading option, the sandbag is preferable to a barbell because the sandbag is not a rigid shape, allowing it to conform to your body more comfortably during calisthenics exercises. I have already made an in-depth post related to sandbags, consult that for information. [https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/bodyweightfitness\/comments\/w5ns7q\/sandbag\\_training\\_an\\_alternative\\_to\\_free\\_weights\/](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/bodyweightfitness\/comments\/w5ns7q\/sandbag_training_an_alternative_to_free_weights\/) \n\n# Compound Exercises\n\n**Progression Standard:** For easier movements, do not progress until you have mastered the technique and basic mobility, and are able to complete *3 sets of 15-20 repetitions with good form, 90 seconds rest between sets.* For more challenging movements such as the pistol squat, instead aim for at least *8-10 repetitions* with good form before moving on.\n\n**Basic Leg Pressing** These are the foundational leg pressing movements to master. If you cannot do the prisoner rear foot elevated split squat and kickstand squat with ease for 15-20 reps, do not move on to the more advanced variations.\n\n**Lunge\/Split Squat**\n\nPrisoner Rear-Foot Elevated Split Squat\n\n* More challenging to stabilize in the prisoner position.\n* [https:\/\/youtu.be\/3-FpGsjtCOs](https:\/\/youtu.be\/3-FpGsjtCOs)\n\nRear-Foot Elevated Split Squat\n\n* A unilateral exercise that will build to several variations\n* [https:\/\/youtu.be\/G0Mo2LF8uLU](https:\/\/youtu.be\/G0Mo2LF8uLU)\n\nPrisoner Lunge\n\n* More challenging to stabilize in the prisoner position.\n* [https:\/\/youtu.be\/hz6NaF\\_7eck](https:\/\/youtu.be\/hz6NaF_7eck)\n\nBodyweight Lunge\n\n* The starting lunge variation.\n* [https:\/\/youtu.be\/-\\_270H-3Wrc](https:\/\/youtu.be\/-_270H-3Wrc)\n\n**Squat**\n\nKickstand Squat\n\n* An introductory exercise for unilateral (single leg) squatting variations.\n* [https:\/\/youtu.be\/HBUJ4e3X8Ok](https:\/\/youtu.be\/HBUJ4e3X8Ok)\n* [https:\/\/youtu.be\/Ux3Z2vt8kLg](https:\/\/youtu.be\/Ux3Z2vt8kLg)\n\nNarrow Stance Squat\n\n* Puts more emphasis on the quads, good precursor to unilateral work. How narrow your stance is varies depending on hip structure, do what is comfortable for you.\n* [https:\/\/youtu.be\/wVhCnAY-TSM](https:\/\/youtu.be\/wVhCnAY-TSM)\n\nPrisoner Squat\n\n* The prisoner stance of the hands prevents them from stabilizing as much, adding an extra challenge. The lower body movement is identical to the bodyweight squat\n* [https:\/\/youtu.be\/jwbEo2nN2IY](https:\/\/youtu.be\/jwbEo2nN2IY)\n\nBodyweight (Air Squat)\n\n* The starting squat variation.\n* [https:\/\/youtu.be\/RClKKQqsvXA](https:\/\/youtu.be\/RClKKQqsvXA)\n\n**Forward-Leaning Leg Press:** Quad exercises where you resist your body shifting forward, or weight is loaded on the front of your body. These exercises tend to be knee dominant, so it is important to build up to the deep knee flexion over time. Make sure to load bands or weight on the front of your body.

Think of this as an elevated pistol squat with less ROM.\n   * [https:\/\/youtu.be\/Eerfi7WaiDE](https:\/\/youtu.be\/Eerfi7WaiDE)\n* Knee Emphasis Split Squat\n   * Maintain an upright posture, but have your knees travel past your toe, increase knee flexion over time. Work on building strength and stability in your knees.\n   * [https:\/\/youtu.be\/RRgaZ1aXSVg](https:\/\/youtu.be\/RRgaZ1aXSVg)\n* Knees Over Toe Lunge\n   * A lunge with a greater degree of knee flexion and ankle dorsiflexion.

Make sure to load bands or weight on the back of your body.  Reference point: A barbell back squat\n\n* Elevated Shrimp Squat\n   * Requires more strength as the leverage on your working leg is worse.\n   * [https:\/\/youtu.be\/nZRYihADTeM](https:\/\/youtu.be\/nZRYihADTeM)\n* Shrimp Squat\n   * The limiting factor for the Shrimp Squat is usually not quad strength, it is glute\/hip strength. For this reason, the prior progressions have more emphasis on the hip musculature.\n   * Beginner & Intermediate: [https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Dpgn6eRtsdw](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Dpgn6eRtsdw)\n   * Advanced: [https:\/\/youtu.be\/5EJtZsA43vI](https:\/\/youtu.be\/5EJtZsA43vI)\n* Deep Step Up\n   * Focus on control and getting a stretch at the bottom. Balance is going to be much harder than the split squat.\n   * [https:\/\/youtu.be\/Qam8p1aTxRQ](https:\/\/youtu.be\/Qam8p1aTxRQ)\n* Hip Emphasis Split Squat\n   * Rather than having an upright posture, you are going to lean forward significantly to change the emphasis of the split squat. This movement has more hip focus, which prepares you for the start of the shrimp squat.\n   * [https:\/\/youtu.be\/UQLU0lwAAPE](https:\/\/youtu.be\/UQLU0lwAAPE)\n* Rear Lunge\n   * Slow and controlled tempo with a slight forward lean.\n   * [https:\/\/programme.app\/exercises\/db-quad-dominant-reverse-lunge\/247](https:\/\/programme.app\/exercises\/db-quad-dominant-reverse-lunge\/247)\n\n**Side-Leaning Leg Presses:** Quad exercises where you resist your body shifting laterally, or where weight is loaded on the side of your body. These tend to be the most often-neglected of the bodyweight presses. Make sure to load bands or weight on the side of your body. The limiting factor for these exercises is usually balance and mobility, simply because they are very different from the other variations.\n\n**Tuck Squat Progression**\n\n* Tuck Squat\n   * An advanced and surprisingly tough lateral squat variation. Despite the name, it is a more similar movement to a pistol squat than the dragon pistol.\n   * [https:\/\/youtu.be\/fQZ-ZbdVxm8](https:\/\/youtu.be\/fQZ-ZbdVxm8)\n* Lateral Step Up\n   * Similar to the deep step up but from the side\n   * [https:\/\/youtu.be\/BauxalC-ksI](https:\/\/youtu.be\/BauxalC-ksI)\n* Elevated Cossack Squat\n   * [https:\/\/youtu.be\/4TdpgwPVCwc](https:\/\/youtu.be\/4TdpgwPVCwc)\n* Cossack Squat\n   * The beginning lateral squat variation, also great for building mobility.\n   * [https:\/\/youtu.be\/dhDjKmTX8tU](https:\/\/youtu.be\/dhDjKmTX8tU)\n\n**Dragon Pistol Progression**\n\n* Dragon Pistol Squat\n   * I have attached a guide to attaining the dragon pistol, as I think it covers everything needed.\n   * [https:\/\/www.mpcalisthenics.com\/tutorial\/dragon-pistol-squat-how-to-unlock-one-of-the-most-difficult-bodyweight-squats](https:\/\/www.mpcalisthenics.com\/tutorial\/dragon-pistol-squat-how-to-unlock-one-of-the-most-difficult-bodyweight-squats)\n* Skier\/Curtsy Lunge\n   * [https:\/\/youtu.be\/rUD0rPjlxdQ](https:\/\/youtu.be\/rUD0rPjlxdQ)\n   * Weighted Suitcase Version: [https:\/\/youtube.com\/shorts\/DpsNSe3VPYI?feature=share](https:\/\/youtube.com\/shorts\/DpsNSe3VPYI?feature=share)\n* 45 Degree (Diagonal) Lunge\n   * [https:\/\/programme.app\/exercises\/45-degree-lunge\/6](https:\/\/programme.app\/exercises\/45-degree-lunge\/6)\n\n# Isolation Exercises\n\nUse a resistance band loaded at or near the hip to majorly improve the resistance curve of these exercises.

Routine feedback requested.","author":"katielovestrees","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/bodyweightfitness\/comments\/11brwt5\/incorporating_crossfitoly_lifts_routine_feedback\/","text":"Hi all, long time listener, first time caller. I've been doing CrossFit for almost five years and am looking to change things up a little. CrossFit is the first and only program I've followed but I've only been going consistently 3-4x a week for the last year and a half after some starts, stops, and injuries. Last year I decided to focus more on BW movements, working to get good form push ups and strict pull-ups. I largely don't follow CrossFit methodology, as I refer to focus on the strength training, power and endurance aspects over speed and efficiency. However, I love all forms of lifting, and have recently started to focus more on Olympic lifts. Where I am at is I want to continue building on strength, focusing on BW movements with barbell work incorporated for the squats and hinges. I've reviewed the RR as well as the new routine and come up with one I'd like to do 2-3x per week. I'd like to also incorporate one day of Oly lifting (ideally Tuesdays because of a dedicated group meeting) and at least do a partner WOD with my husband 1-2x per week. I'm also separately adding in more cardio, both LISS (during work and as warmups) and occasionally (say 1x per week) a longer bike\/run\/row session.\n\nI recently learned that I am hypermobile and because of that I recover slower than most people, so I do have some concerns about overall training volume and building in rest. My lifestyle factors are overall good to support recovery - I get enough sleep, mobilize and warm up properly, stretch, hydrate, and minimize alcohol. My stress is fairly well managed though that is the one I struggle with most. My nutrition is still being dialed in but I eat enough protein, fruits and veg, and have started adding carbs before my workouts to positive effect, and I supplement with creatine daily. I can't take magnesium because of it's gastric effects. Might be over-sharing but trying to get ahead of questions, I as I really am looking for routine-specific feedback!\n\nHere's the BW routine I'd like to do - assume 3x8-12 for each, likely supersetting most of the time but on days where I have more time I'd do regular sets. In case it's not obvious, I do plan to follow a progression for these movements - e.g. moving to decline push ups once I master them which will likely be fairly quick. \n\u2022 Pike push up (or dips or HSPU) + pull up\n\u2022 Push ups and ring rows\n\u2022 Squats + hinges (rdls 2x week DL 1x a week)\n\u2022 Deadbugs and bird dogs - maybe subbing in strict sit ups or v-ups from time to time as these are common in CF workouts and I am working on getting toes to bar, which the v-ups have helped tremendously with\n\nHere's the routine I'd like to do:\n\nSu: CrossFit partner WOD (varied, these workouts are typically longer so I tend to scale - focus is on keeping moving, not putting up heavy reps). Run instead (5k min) on days I don't make it to the gym. Long walk after either. Evening stretch\n\n-M-F am stretch\/mobility\/yoga\/pilates, walk during work. Warm up for all workouts with mobilizing and 10m cardio.\n\nM: BW routine\nT: Oly lifting\nW: Rest\nTh: BW routine\nF: BW routine or partner WOD\nSa: Rest\n\nAnybody got any guidance or feedback on this, given my recovery? I honestly think I just needed to write it all out to have a plan, but I'm wondering how Oly is gonna mix in and am curious to hear if others have tried a mixed\/similar approach and have any feedback to share.","upvote_ratio":0.85,"created_utc":1677349647.0},{"title":"minimum amounts of sets per week","author":"Regular-Resolve6963","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/bodyweightfitness\/comments\/11brg41\/minimum_amounts_of_sets_per_week\/","text":"As the title says, which is the minimum amount of sets per muscle group per week to follow in the long term, assuming that every set is to\/close to failure and\/or someone follows progressions when something gets too easy?\nRead in the wiki that 4-6 sets to failure per week is enough even for advanced people.

For those familiar with the program I was pretty comfortable starting with phase 3 due to my established pulling strength. For this unfamiliar this is a pretty high volume (3 days a week) pull up focused program that includes OAC eccentrics, assisted OAC, weighted pullups, and accessory movements.\n\nEssentially, the purpose of this post is to try to gauge where I am in relation to achieving the OAC and to potentially identify what I  should be focusing more on.\n\nWhere I am:\n\n* Last time I tested my ring weighted pull-up 1RM (maybe a few months ago (around the start of the program) and I have gotten stronger since) I  could do about 3 sets of 1 at 110lb (I weigh 160lb and am at 9.9% BW  (DEXA scan))\n* I can do at least 1-2 good tempo weighted OAC eccentrics at +15lb\n* I seem to hover between about 5-7.5 lb of assistance necessary to rep out 2-3 assisted OAC\u2019s (strap pulley system)\n\nI feel as though I should be able to do at least one OAC rep at this point and am wondering:\n\n* What numbers were others at around when they first achieved a OAC\n* Am I crazy for thinking I should have achieved this by now?\n* Are there any tips on identifying what my weakpoint might be if so?\n\nAs far as weaknesses go I have had tendonitis pretty bad in the past  but doing Zottman curls during my pull days has entirely eliminated them.  Maybe I should switch to more strength oriented curls on at least some of the days to build bicep strength (the program offers options as to using the curl block for predominantly strength or re\/prehab)?\n\nI don\u2019t seem to be able to get off the bottom of a one arm hang, so maybe scap shrugs would help as well? I have been climbing about an hour to two a week for the past month and a half and initially dropped one of the pulling days as a result.

Besides strength and hypertrophy, regular lower leg training is also helpful for preventing ankle and knee injuries, and absorbing shock to your legs in high-impact activities.\n\n**Addressing Bro Science** \n\nThere is a lot of bro-science floating around the internet regarding calf training, often espoused by those with naturally large calves, people who needed hardly any stimulus at all to get results. They'll tell you that you should just do leg compound training, or minimal lower leg work, because that's what worked for them. Essentially, do nothing for the calves and they will magically continue to improve. \n\nThe other patch of misinformation seems to come from old school bodybuilders, muscle men of the 1970's who believed that extremely high rep calf work was the secret, when I suspect the real cause was the anabolic steroids compensating for inefficient training practices and excessive volume.\n\nI've personally grappled with how to train the calves for almost a decade, and had to try and then disregard much of the advice I've encountered over that time period. It was only when I figured out what truly worked that I was able to take my calf development from mediocre to slightly-above-adequate. \n\nUltimately, there are only a few training principles that will make a major difference in your calf results. I've listed them below.\n\n**Key Principles**\n\n1. Range of Motion\n   1. Elevate your feet on a solid surface that allows you to maximally dorsiflex your heels. The strong stretch at the bottom is very important for hypertrophy and developing end-range strength and stability in the ankles. Contracting hard at the very top of the movement is also important.\n2. Consistency, Frequency, & Good Form\n   1. Calves and tibilias benefit from frequent training and need to be trained with proper form to avoid injury and stagnating progress. Make sure to **PAUSE** at the top and bottom of each rep for second for maximum contraction before continuing. These muscles are small, fast to recover, and can be worked anywhere from **2-5 days a week** without majorly hindering progress.\n\n*  If you want to train at high frequency (4 or more days\/wk), rotate variations of each exercise to prevent localized wear and tear. Ex: 2 straight leg variations and 2 bent leg variations.\n\n1. Proper Loading\n   1. Add load gradually but consistently with lower leg training. Contrary to the previously mentioned old-school bodybuilding ideas, extremely high rep calf training is not efficient for continued growth in most trainees. Instead, I recommend getting in sufficient volume by training the calves more frequently, with mostly more intense sets in the 6-20 rep range, and occasional 20-30 rep pump work. Follow the principles of progressive overload.\n2. Sufficient Fatigue\n   1. The calves are fatigue-resistant muscles due to carrying around the weight of your body all day. You will have to work hard to fatigue them using methods like myoreps (see the Renaissance periodization article above), occlusion and short rest times.\n   2. Gradually work your way down from 90 second to rest periods of less than 30 seconds for calf and tibialis work. Ideally aim for around 20 seconds between sets. Superset bent leg and straight leg calf work to save time and add further challenge. \n\n**Tools for Lower Leg Training**\n\nOptimizing calf training also requires the use of a few key tools, listed below.\n\n**Note:**  All of these tools work for both calf raises and for tibialis raises.\n\n1. Elevated Surface (Calf Block or Stairs)\n   1. Elevate your feet to get an optimal stretch. I recommend either a steep set of stairs or a calf-raise block. Calf raise blocks are preferable because they are portable.\n   2. DIY Calf Raise Block: [https:\/\/youtu.be\/drOd4Askpvw](https:\/\/youtu.be\/drOd4Askpvw)\n2. Resistance Bands\n   1. Calf and tibialis raises are easy to \"cheat\" at the top of the movement, so the accommodating resistance prevents this from happening. Bands are also the most portable and convenient way to add external load to the lower leg.\n   2. The more challenging bodyweight calf exercises have a horizontal lean, so bands are even more useful as a way to improve the resistance curves.\n3. Weight Vests\/External Load\n   1. Weight vests and external load are useful once you have maximized your progress with bodyweight and bands. I recommend adding these **only** after mastering the single leg versions of the advanced exercises. Many people are impatient with letting their ankles and feet adapt to loading before they start adding on weight aggressively. \n4. (Optional, But Highly Recommended) Resistance Band Platform\n   1. A resistance band platform is extremely useful for lower body training with bands, as a portable way to anchor down your bands and open up more options for exercises.\n   2. DIY Resistance Band Platform: [https:\/\/youtu.be\/y7fyVoTk7IA](https:\/\/youtu.be\/y7fyVoTk7IA)\n5. (Optional) Occlusion Bands\n   1. Occlusion or blood-flow restriction (BFR training) is a simple way to increase the difficulty of lower body exercises without having to modify load or leverage. The calves and tibialis respond particularly well to this style of training, so of any muscle group in the legs they are the most likely to benefit from this.\n   2. What you are doing is slightly constricting the area right above the muscles of the lower leg with an elastic band. This temporary restriction in blood flow to the muscle makes the exercise more fatiguing, as the muscle cannot shuttle out metabolites as effectively. This can be an effective method to induce hypertrophy even while working with very light loads (30% of 1RM). \n      1. Ex: [https:\/\/youtu.be\/OiuvyNgO6r0](https:\/\/youtu.be\/OiuvyNgO6r0)\n      2. Calf muscles adapt quickly to BFR training, so use it in short training mesocycles or only for part of your lower leg training in a week.\n   3. For best results and safety, use elastic BFR bands with a quick-release so you can immediately release the pressure on the muscle when you finish a set.\n      1. [https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Occlusion-BFR-PRO-Restriction-Research-Backed\/dp\/B07613TPVL\/ref=sr\\_1\\_10?crid=2905TGWIJ08ZV&keywords=bfr+band&qid=1676429764&sprefix=bf+%2Caps%2C525&sr=8-10](https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Occlusion-BFR-PRO-Restriction-Research-Backed\/dp\/B07613TPVL\/ref=sr_1_10?crid=2905TGWIJ08ZV&keywords=bfr+band&qid=1676429764&sprefix=bf+%2Caps%2C525&sr=8-10)\n   4. **Do not** wear BFR bands for long periods of time. For strength-training, I wouldn't wear them for longer than *1.5-2 minutes* without releasing the pressure. When training multiple sets of an exercise, you are fine to remove the bands between sets and re-wrap your limb when starting the next one.\n   5. **Warning:** Use caution when training with occlusion bands, as you are restricting blood flow. Avoid these if you have any relevant health concerns or issues with blood pressure, circulation, etc.\n\n**Calf Raises**\n\nIncreasing the intensity of lower leg training with bodyweight alone requires putting the calves in a position of increasingly poor leverage, as well as unilateral training. This is actually fairly simple to implement, but there are a few things to take into to account to maximize your results. \n\n**Straight Leg & Bent Leg Variants** \n\nIn order to train the calves properly, you need to incorporate both bent leg and straight leg calf raise variations. The reason is that the calf muscles are actually two muscles that work in synergy, but have slightly different roles. \n\nThese muscles are called the *gastrocnemius* and the *soleus.* \n\n* The gastrocnemius is primarily engaged in straight leg variations, and is more fast-twitch muscle dominant than the soleus. This means straight leg variants often give better results by slightly emphasizing intensity of the load over volume. Ex: A set of 3x6-10 reps of straight leg calf raises.\n* The soleus is primarily engaged in bent leg variations, and is more slow-twitch muscle dominant than the gastrocnemius. This means bent leg variations often give better results by slightly  emphasizing volume over the intensity of the load. Ex: A set of 4x10-12 reps of bent leg calf raises. \n\n**Unilateral Training**\n\nMove from double leg to single leg variations to increase difficulty. Use assisted variations as a stepping stone when needed.\n\n1. Single Leg\n2. Assisted: [https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=KFl0\\_WNw5QU](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=KFl0_WNw5QU)\n3. Double Leg\n\n**3 Position Calf Raise Technique:** To emphasize the different areas of the calf, make sure to use the 3-position calf raise technique. You can do this for bent and straight leg variants. Here is a demo of how to modify your foot positions accordingly [https:\/\/youtu.be\/UiSaISW70B8](https:\/\/youtu.be\/UiSaISW70B8)\n\n**Calf Raise Progressions**\n\nAdvanced Bent Leg Progressions (Soleus)\n\n* Rear Foot Elevated Split Squat Calf Raise\n   * The most challenging bodyweight bent leg variation. Thankfully, it is easy to add load, since you just have to get into the bottom of a split squat. Dorsiflex the ankle as much as possible. \n   *  [https:\/\/youtube.com\/shorts\/h8MKZNhrZE8?feature=share](https:\/\/youtube.com\/shorts\/h8MKZNhrZE8?feature=share)\n* Deep Squat Calf Raise (Soleus)\n   * [https:\/\/youtu.be\/yxNCjiW24Gs](https:\/\/youtu.be\/yxNCjiW24Gs) \n   * These put the soleus in a very deep end-range stretch. \n   * Master the single leg before moving on to the rear foot elevated split squat.\n\nAdvanced Straight Leg Progression (Gastrocnemius) \n\n* Wall Leaning Calf Raise (Gasrocnemius) \n   *  [https:\/\/youtu.be\/hev7JGwcq3w](https:\/\/youtu.be\/hev7JGwcq3w)\n   * Make sure to still have a small amount of heel elevation like a calf raise block, then lean as far forward as you can tolerate. You should experience a strong stretch, avoid using momentum or bouncing. Vary foot position (inward, neutral, outward) to emphasize different parts of the gastrocnemius. \n   * This exercise is hugely improved by the use of a band to make the top of the calf raise more challenging.\n\n**Easier Calf Progressions** \n\nDonkey Calf Raise (Bent and Straight Leg) \n\n* Single Leg: [https:\/\/youtu.be\/aRvjK9jy3Ms](https:\/\/youtu.be\/aRvjK9jy3Ms)\n* [https:\/\/youtu.be\/1KhIbdSnHP8](https:\/\/youtu.be\/1KhIbdSnHP8) \n* Demo of 3 Way Donkey Calf Raise[https:\/\/youtube.com\/shorts\/yVZhTe8Y2-8?feature=share](https:\/\/youtube.com\/shorts\/yVZhTe8Y2-8?feature=share)\n* Stretch your heels heels on a raised surface. Leaning forward like this puts your calves into a position of worse leverage, adding to the difficulty. Load bands and weight at the hip. For bent leg variations, get into the same position and bend the knee.\n* Progress to single leg variations before moving on to the advanced calf exercises. \n* Standing Calf Raise (Bent and Straight Leg)\n* The double leg bodyweight calf raise is the starting point for all calf training. It will not be very challenging after a while, but focus on clean form while building mobility and stability in your ankles. I recommend dprogressing after being able to handle 4x20 reps for single leg variations.\n* Single Leg: [https:\/\/youtu.be\/OBzVJ9anSz](https:\/\/youtu.be\/OBzVJ9anSzs)\n   * Bent Leg Variation: [https:\/\/youtu.be\/\\_VEku5gTQeU](https:\/\/youtu.be\/_VEku5gTQeU) \n* Double Leg [https:\/\/youtu.be\/cktrbwJdYSo](https:\/\/youtu.be\/cktrbwJdYSo)\n\n**Tibialis Raises (Training The Antagonist Muscles)**\n\nThe tibialis muscle is the antagonist muscle to the calves. It is important to train these to have a balanced lower leg musculature and avoid injury. There is only one basic tibialis exercise, with a few variations to modify difficulty. The tibialis muscles, in my experience, respond well to higher rep \"pump work\", much like the soleus. \n\nWall Leaning Tibialis Raise\n\n* Single Leg: [https:\/\/youtube.com\/shorts\/DXQHoFM7A28?feature=share](https:\/\/youtube.com\/shorts\/DXQHoFM7A28?feature=share)\n* Double Leg: [https:\/\/youtu.be\/OPEuhclsTUQ](https:\/\/youtu.be\/OPEuhclsTUQ) \n* The more your legs are out in front of you, the higher the difficulty. Lean your torso forward to further increase the challenge. Load a band underneath the heel for added resistance. After you progress to the single leg version, consider adding load.\n\n**(Optional) Explosive Lower Leg Work**\n\nIf you want to train the calves for explosive movement, there are a few useful options. I consider this a supplement to standard lower leg training, and I recommend doing the standard calf work for a while before integrating these. The first two options (jump roping and kettlebell jerks) are great exercises for conditioning as well. I personally prefer these as I have had better results from training explosive\n\n**Jump Roping**\n\nI'm a bit surprised that I don't see more posts about jump roping in bodyweight fitness circles, it's very inexpensive, purely a bodyweight exercise, and has a lot of benefits for coordination, balance, and cardiovascular fitness. It's also quite fun and allows for a lot of variety.  They were a staple of my training during my (brief and miserable) career as a high-school wrestler as well as one of my more aggressive cuts after a bulk phase. Prepare to be humbled, jump roping is a surprisingly intense conditioning workout.\n\n* Jump Roping Demo: [https:\/\/youtu.be\/NkXDy8K-1jY](https:\/\/youtu.be\/NkXDy8K-1jY)\n* Advanced Progressions:  [https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=PUCQ2pvnyW4](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=PUCQ2pvnyW4)\n\n**Kettlebell\/Dumbell Jerks**\n\nThe kettlebell jerk is not a bodyweight exercise, but it is my favorite one for explosive calf training. I love it because it can be a way to safely and effectively add load to your explosive movement. You can load it with a single kettlebell\/dumbell, or use a pair. The jerk has similar benefits to jump roping if trained for high enough reps, which is very possible, considering the jerk for reps is an event is kettlebell sport: [https:\/\/youtu.be\/-4ldxK0eheM](https:\/\/youtu.be\/-4ldxK0eheM)\n\n* [https:\/\/youtu.be\/19UTShhUhR4](https:\/\/youtu.be\/19UTShhUhR4)\n* Dumbell Variation: [https:\/\/youtu.be\/d2d8D907bq0](https:\/\/youtu.be\/d2d8D907bq0)\n\n**Plyometrics**\n\nOften used by track and field athletes to increase spring and explosiveness in their legs. Be cautious when first integrating plyometric training, it can be intense loading. You need to have the baseline calf tendon and ligament strength adaptions from several months of regular calf strength training before you start plyometrics.\n\nTiggers: [https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=jgIbq2C\\_v2c](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=jgIbq2C_v2c)\n\nAdvanced Calf Plyometrics: [https:\/\/youtu.be\/lfJ-pX4vGR0](https:\/\/youtu.be\/lfJ-pX4vGR0)","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1676702493.0},{"title":"Weight Vest - Storage - Does anyone have experience using a Wall Panel Solution?","author":"AlexMaskovyak","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/bodyweightfitness\/comments\/116ffg0\/weight_vest_storage_does_anyone_have_experience\/","text":"I'm having trouble narrowing down a way to store my weight vests.

You draw this line as close to the previous line as possible, if you cross the previous line your turn is over. If you keep the line till the end of the paper your turn is also over. \n\nSo I post it here for several reasons. First I guess it is a fun game to play.

I tried to cope with thta by eating more.... therefore my weight gain in 2022 from 90kg(198lbs) to 105kg (230lbs).According to dexa scans my weight gain during that period was 65% fat and 35% muscle.\n\nIn addition to that i currently have ulnar nerve pain in my left elbow, probably from just beeing to tight and overuse and every now and then dealing with knee pain and anterior pelvic tilt. Together with my high bodyweight i just feel sluggish lately, not fit at all...rather slow. I might be able to lift some good amount of weight but it just doesnt feel good anymore, since I'm close to beein 30 years old.\n\nI want to become more athletic and nimble again, not having my knee ache when i do a sudden bodyweight squat to pick something up, not to be reliant on knee wraps and so on.\n\nI recently got a new mountainbike aswell as a pair of running shoes. Improving my carido is one thing I want to change but I also think bodyweight fitness would improve my well beeing.\n\nI just dont really know where to start with my bodyweight and strength. Also I'm looking for recommendations to what Youtuber delivers good content. I know nearly every bodybilding or powerlifting Youtuber out there, but got no clue on bodyweight fitness.I guess I wouldn't quit weight training completly, just substitute most of it. Legs would be something I might continue with weights, eg lighter front squats.\n\nI looked into the FAQ, but the routines there are just too much beginner level.

I had some spare time to finish this year's update early since I had to get some surgery done. A badly herniated cervical disc had to be removed before it caused more severe nerve damage. Based on my previous experience I'm expecting it's going to take 3-5+ years to recover back to \"normal\". But that's why they say that fitness is really a lifelong maraton, not a sprint. If I was smart I would start training those small calves of mine since it's pretty much the only functional muscle group at this time. So I'll be walking and doing only calf raises for a long time. \n\nI\u2019m just sharing this as some motivation. There will be challenging times but it's up to you how you handle the situation. So I encourage you to just try to make the best of the current situation and keep the ball rolling. And hold onto any momentum you have. It takes much less energy to keep that wheel spinning than trying to get it back moving once it has come to a halt. It's basic physics but it applies to many other aspects of life as well.\n\nAnyways\u2026to the point. The previous versions do get daily downloads still so probably they have been useful for some of you. I personally use these templates and nothing else. They get the job done. And I prefer that the exercise library is based on home exercises with minimal equipment required.\n\nHere's a list of new features added to the existing Google Sheets:\n\n* Fully functional rep max calculator that takes into account your bodyweight. So you get a good estimation if you do weighted bodyweight work such as weighted pullups and dips. You can select 1RM, 3RM, 5RM etc depending on which rep range performance you are interested in. \n* Mobile layout that should work with most modern screens. For smaller screens you have to be more accurate with your thumb work. Desktop layout is also provided but some of the programs are copied only to the mobile layout. The RR is also still included but it uses the exercises on the old wiki. \n* Mobile layout looks good with the dark theme also so you don't get blinded if you happen to plan or check your stats when the lights are out.\n* Basic dumbbell, barbell and resistance band exercises added to the library. So basically you can run a full basic weight training program or hybrid from the template without adding new exercises to the library.\n* Added a calculator to the planning page to estimate duration of the training sessions so you don't plan too long sessions\n* Workaround for high frequency training. You can now split the existing workout days into smaller sections using spacers from the dropdown menu. \n* Added a 5x week (optional 6x) push,pull legs routine for those who are doing K Boges style high frequency training. You can add accessory work (calves, extensions, abs, hamstrings, direct arm work) according to your needs. Someone is going to ask how to do such a routine since the template has been designed for a maximum 4-days\u2026so I saved you the trouble and created a ready made template. You can use the same idea and expand it to 7-days a week.\n* Added some weight lifting routines based on the same splits as the bodyweight stuff. Just some classic upper\/lower, 3-day and 4-day splits. So it can be used even if bodyweight training is not your thing. You can combine bodweight, weights and resistance band training according to your needs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Detailed user guide can be found here:**\n\nBodyweight strength training on Google sheets 2023 update user guide\n\n[https:\/\/twoworkouts.blogspot.com\/2023\/02\/bodyweight-strength-training-programs.html](https:\/\/twoworkouts.blogspot.com\/2023\/02\/bodyweight-strength-training-programs.html)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Here you can find the files and Demo files I used in the user guide so you can try how the rep max calculator works with pre filled data.**\n\n[https:\/\/drive.google.com\/drive\/folders\/1U9SMAVYMKA5N6kcL1XqD\\_NJV4l7v489S?usp=share\\_link](https:\/\/drive.google.com\/drive\/folders\/1U9SMAVYMKA5N6kcL1XqD_NJV4l7v489S?usp=share_link)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**If you find any bugs** let me know in this thread.

Controversy surrounded proper deadbug form and I realized that there was something that a large number of people were confused about.  \n\nOne redditor who has a \"Trusted User\" tag offered advice which many people read.  However, this advice is potentially problematic for some people and, realizing that the misconception was one held by much of the community, I thought I'd make a separate post.  The concept is actually pretty simple, but some terms have to be defined first so we are all on the same page.\n\nThe advice given was to keep the lumbar spine flat against the ground during the deadbugs.  This was described as a \"neutral\" spine, maintained by anti-extension.  \n\nHowever, *a neutral spine actually has some curvature*: it is an 'S' curve when viewed laterally, with a slight arch to the lumbar spine, and slight rounding of the thoracic spine.  In other words a bit of lumbar curve is healthy, strong, stable, *and \"neutral\"*.  What this means is that the flat back touching the floor is not neutral; it is more properly called a *flexed* lumbar spine.  That is an established anatomical, medical fact; it is inarguable, and yet the premise of the argument was based partly on this potentially dangerous misunderstanding (more on that in a moment).  \n\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nIn the future here's a tip that might help if people are confused about alignment: if you have to make a movement (flexion, extension, adduction, abduction, rotation, protraction, retraction, elevation, depression etc) then that body part is no longer in a neutral position.  \n\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nBack to deadbugs.  When laying down on the floor, the spine tends to sink and flatten.  This is fine while resting, but under effort it is safest to maintain the natural curvature.  With a neutral spine maintained, that slight arch of the lumbar will not quite touch the floor; it will certainly not be pushed down into it as the advice given in the aforementioned thread.  \n\nHowever, when performing the deadbugs, the hip flexors of the extended leg can tend to pull the low back further up off the floor than the neutral curve.  If a flat back is flexed, this increased arch lifting the low back further off the floor is extension.  Just as the flattened back is a divergence from the natural curve called flexion, the increased arch of the low back being pulled further off the floor is an extension (divergence in the opposite direction from flexion).  What we generally want is to maintain spinal stability against forces which pull the lumbar spine, in one direction or the other, away from its neutral curve.  As I mentioned, the hip flexors cause increased arch i.e. extension of the spine, hence the need for *anti-extension* during deadbugs.  \n\nThis brings us to the next misunderstanding.  Resisting this extension (anti-extension) is what is most vital to the lumbar spine during deadbugs.  However, while resisting this extension is important, going even further and overcoming it altogether flattens the back, which is flexion.  This is key: flexion and anti-extension are not the same thing even if they oppose the same forces.  \n\nIn other words, anti-extension is simply resisting movement caused by an external force (maintenance of lumbar stability), while flexion is bending the spine in the opposite direction.  I think this is one of the things unclear in the discussion: anti-extension is *not* the same thing as flexion, and the back flat on the floor is a flexed lumbar spine.   In summary, the trusted user is confusing flexion for anti-extension; he is not a trained nor educated professional and this is one of the things that makes that glaringly apparent.\n\nNow, anti-extension is important in deadbugs, whether you keep the lumbar naturally curved and slightly off the floor or are flattening it - and both variations can be good for different reasons.  It can actually be good to develop the strength to stabilize the spine safely in that flexed position.  That is why I agree with the user that it is a useful way  to do deadbugs.  However, it is not *the only* way to do them.  For example, while the natural curve is always safe if maintained, flexion (i.e. back flat against the ground) under load can actually be problematic for some people sometimes.  \n\n**The biggest take-away here is that anti-extension - which creates the stable spine during deadbugs - does not necessarily mean flat low back**.  And the advice given was that 1) flat back is a neutral spine; 2) maintenance of the flat back is anti-extension.  Both are mistaken.  As long as the external forces are resisted to prevent lumbar lifting further off the floor, anti-extension is accomplished.  This does not require actual flexion (flattening or rounding of low back).  ***It's important to understand this because for those who have back pain, flexion intolerance is one of the most common issues.  These people need to avoid flattening the low back against the ground, until they have strengthed.**  [Source](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=0XVbn86Btj0&ab_channel=SquatUniversity) \n\nAdditionally, that flat lumbar spine can be accomplished without the muscles which actually resist flexion.  For example, gluteal contraction can tuck the pelvis under which flattens the low back and mimics the same alignment but without muscular stabilization of the spine.  This leaves the spine vulnerable.  That is one of the reasons that the back being flat against the ground is not necessarily safe for everyone all the time: because spinal stability is not guaranteed.  **The cue to flatten the back against the ground is not fool proof to achieving anti-extension with a stable spine.**  At best it's a decent proxy for most people most of the time.  At worst it will lead to more pain for those already having problems.  \n\nCheers","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1676574001.0},{"title":"Attaching gym rings to a doorway pullup bar","author":"mochaz","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/bodyweightfitness\/comments\/1145g1o\/attaching_gym_rings_to_a_doorway_pullup_bar\/","text":"I was thinking of buying a pullup bar to attach some rings to, but was wondering if using the rings at an angle might dislodge the bar from the door.

Hoping to get some advice on progressing with  PPPUs and Incline Rows, which I seem to be stagnating on.\n\nFor Pseudo Planche Pushups, I'm having a difficult time calibrating the difficulty so it's roughly the same each time. I progressed to where I can easily do three sets of eight reps, so I'm trying to make it a little harder, however even a small further lean forward increases the difficulty much more that I need to, so I end up unintentionally falling back to the 'easy' position (or so it seems). Also, it's hard to tell if I'm doing the same difficulty each time or shifting my position in some small way to negate any progression. Is there a suggested way to handle this? I considered perhaps doing a different kind of pushup, but I didn't want to deviate from the RR too much since it seems like such a well balanced program.\n\nFor Incline Rows, the problem is similar, but not as severe.

As I understand I'm at somewhat of a disadvantage (6'0\" and ~175 lbs \/ ~80 kg with long arms), yet I'd still like some feedback on my routine.\n\nFor the planche, I have been able to do tuck planche for as long as 30 seconds for several years, but never have been able to reach advanced tuck planche for more than 2-3 seconds. For this reason, I figured I should prioritize leaning.\n\nFor the front lever, I have been able to do both one-leg and frog front levers on the rings for up to ~20 seconds for some time now, but am unable to do straddle. It should be noted my straddle flexibility is low and I am working on that as well.\n\nI've done a few different routine styles over the past years, starting with MWF full-body then transitioning to MTRF full-body. My primary goal is strength. \n\nHere is a new routine I put together after lots of research. I'm currently in my third 5 week cycle, but would like to hear feedback, if any.\n\nMonday:\n\nSets of band-assisted adv tuck planche paired with sets of frog front lever (per prilepin chart)\n\nSets of wall straddle press to HS eccentrics paired with band-assisted OAPU work\n\n3x 5 barbell squats\n\nTuesday\/Thursday\/Friday:\n\n3x 6 incline PPPUs with 3s hold at top\n\n3x 5 adv tuck FL straight-arm pulls to inverted hang and back on rings\n\n3x 2 frog-stand to HS to HSPU\n\n3x 5 weighted pull-up\n\n3x 5 deadlift OR 1x 3 snatch OR 1x 3 power clean depending on day\n\n4x 15s L-sit\n\nI know it's a bit of a strange split but I figured one day a week of isometrics might do me some good if I really want those positions. The straddle press eccentrics and the L-sits are for compression work, a major weak point for me.\n\nMy main question would be am I doing enough PL and FL work, or should I do something like the isometrics plus the dynamics for each of them 4 days a week (something I don't think I have the time for unless I remove the HSPUs and weighted pull-ups)? Another option, since time is tight, would be to revert to 3 days a week MWF, in which case I probably could fit 2 PL exercises, 2 FL exercises, my HSPUs and pull-ups, and the legs. I worry that that won't be enough frequency, however, especially as I'm trying to bust through plateaus. For reference, I don't feel under-recovered and am keen to rest when my body tells me to (but that hasn't been too often hence why I think it's more an issue of not enough volume\/intensity).\n\nIn any case, I appreciate any of you that have any thoughts or advice that can help me break through this multi-year plateau.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1676242300.0},{"title":"Weighted training for brutal strength ans muscle grow","author":"Czechbeastm","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/bodyweightfitness\/comments\/110msl1\/weighted_training_for_brutal_strength_ans_muscle\/","text":"Hi, I wanted to try some a new training for me, which is weighted calisthenics.

I always had trouble with sticking with a program, often due to exercise creep (always trying to add exercises and do more, then hitting plateau\/CNS fatigue) and quitting, and not making my fitness a priority (which I am now).\n\nI have been very good sticking to my current \"minimalist\" routine and made great progress\/gains nearly the entire time. - started in June 2022.  \n\nI think its time to change it up a bit as it is  getting stale\/boring\/plateauing....plus the back injury may be a wakeup call to get really serious about planning a well rounded workout.\n\n**\\*\\*My stats\/limitations:\\*\\*M\/49, 5'10, 215 lbs (working toward goal wt of 180)**\n\nI have foot problems - plantar fasciitis, toe & heel pain, joint damage from Gout possibly...really bad and every time i deadlift it seems to get worse - squatting not so bad...workarounds?  I can walk about 1\/2 mile before pain sets in. I think the deadlifts tighten the hams maybe just a hair more which leads to pain...I try to stretch and massage regularly.\n\nWrist\/grip - it's been a weak point my whole life, so I must limit heavy load\/ exercises that require strong grip - so I lean towards higher reps in the 15-20 range....this is not something i can change - i already have tendonitis in my forearms. Doing wrist and grip exercises just leads to more tendonitis... just a limitation I have to live with. I also believe higher reps\/lower weight  will mean less joint wear and injury (at 20 this was not a concern, at 49 it certainly is)\n\n**My goals:**\n\n\\- Functional fitness that will allow me work (mobile technician, Moderately active job with occasional short bouts of heavy lifting) and to enjoy the sport I love (mountain biking) without fatiguing too quickly,\n\n\\- greatly reducing risk of injury while working\/being active.\n\n\\- to be as able and ready as possible to save my own ass when the zombie apocalypse comes\n\n\\- Weight loss - goal weight 180 lbs. I have  a plan and its working so no need for advice on this.\n\n\\- Keep workout time to a minimum as few hrs per week as possible (4-6 hrs per week). I have a business to run and other obligations, would love to devote more time to fitness but just not possible at this point in my life.  I try to get some cardio in additon to the routine below, but its hard in winter as that is my busy work season. I mountain bike in the summer 2-3 times per week if possible. Occasional yoga workout too.\n\n**NOT my goals in any way:**\n\n\\- being a beast, gaining mass, getting ripped, looking good on the beach.\n\n**My current routine:**\n\n**Full body workout performed every 3rd day (takes me about 1.5 hrs).

I am willing to try light deadlifts again, but if it aggravates my Plantar fascitis I will need to find a workaround.\n\nshould I split my routine?\n\nI was thinking maybe this would be a more rounded plan in line with my goals: (thoughts\/suggestions?):\n\nworkout 1: pullup pushup lunges curnches deadlifts or good mornings\n\nworkout 2: row, shoulder press, squat, wood chopper, front loaded weighted carry (50-70 lbs to start)keeping in line with my workout frequency do workout 1, then rest 2 days then do workout 2, rest 2 days - so i am repeating each workout every 6th day....and each workout is somewhat full body.\n\nMy equipment: dual stack functional trainer, pullup bars, TRX suspension rig, Swiss ball, assorted bands, Treadmill, Spin bike.","upvote_ratio":0.61,"created_utc":1676243817.0},{"title":"Exercises For Fractured Wrist","author":"TakinUhPewppppp","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/bodyweightfitness\/comments\/110rahy\/exercises_for_fractured_wrist\/","text":"Hey!

The knowledge pooled here impresses me every time anew and I am happy to say that the Recommended Routine has now become an essential part of maintaining my physical fitness. \n\n.. Which is insane considering that 2-3 years ago I weighed >100 kg not being able to perform a single pullup (now 70 kg doing multiple sets of L-Sit Chinups, Ring-Dips and all this cool stuff!)\n\nIn the last year, it has become established for me to do the RR 3 times a week. In addition, I always do a lot of running during the week (mostly morning runs before work) and usually a \"bigger\" run on the weekends (> 10k).\n\nNow a friend of mine introduced me to bouldering and it is so so so much fun for me! After hitting the climbing gym very inconsistently over a few month I know finally signed up to a membership and go bouldering 2x a week (MON + THU).\n\nWell this is, where my problem lies .. I really want to go 2x a week but I also dont want to ditch the RR. I already went from 3x RR to 2x RR but I still feel like my arms, wrists and ellbows need more resting. I think the biggest part of the problem is me beeing a complete beginner at climbing .. I find myself often muscleing my way through problems and using way to much of my energy (if this makes sense?).\n\nMy week right now looks like this (stretching\/mobility often included on rest days):\n\n1. MON: morning run + bouldering\n2. TUE: rest day\n3. WED: mornign run + RR \n4. THU: morning run + bouldering\n5. FRI: rest day\n6. SAT: long run (optional depending on weekend plans)\n7. SUN: no run + RR\n\nWhat frustrates me is that I can think of so many adjustments to make to my plan (putting RR and climbing together, splitting RR parts, less pulling stuff, changing the weekly schedule itself) but I just have no idea what would work and what would not.\n\nIs doing the RR the day before bouldering even a good idea?\n\nPerhaps an other calisthenics routine than the RR would fit my needs better? But I basically want to hold on to the RR because I really like its simplicity, completeness and repetition. \n\nAny suggestions and ideas are highly appreciated.

The common practice is a planned deload every 4-8 weeks or so, personally I've only taken a planned deload twice in 2021(I did have poor progress overall due to bad sleep and a very complicated relationship I'm glad is now over), mainly because I always found things came up in life and I had to tone the workouts back for anywhere from 4-5 days to 2 weeks or so, or even skipping a week occasionally.\n\nMore recently now that I have gotten in the habit of being more consistent with my workouts and even sticking following my plan on bad days, I'm kinda playing it by ear.. for example if I feel absolutely wrecked I just skip one session and come back 3-4 days later and resume, or if I have any overuse issues I just reduce the volume and intensity on the affected area(for example with messy triceps I just cut down on presses and just do high rep pushdowns). \n\nI don't know if this is a place my intuitions are wrong, I've seen bodybuilders talk about the localised deload and it kinda sits with me because 9\/10 times I just don't feel the need to cruise along an entire week. I can see how bodybuilders might make this work, however is there any major downsides in terms of strength gains with these localised reactive deloads?\n\nThe main thing I've run into is that I'm not quite sure if need a deload, I'm overdoing the volume, or my recovery isn't on point(tend to suffer with some insomnia, plus my diet is not always consistent). For example, about 4 weeks ago I had a deload where I skipped a session, did 2 pull and 2 legs with no pushing as my triceps felt a bit dead, and a third session where the volume was normal(2push\/2pull\/2legs+isolation stuff), but staying away from failure. 1-2 weeks ago my bicep started causing issues and I felt seriously beaten up so I just toned back on my assisted OAC work, skipped pullups for one session and.. I feel alright now? \nSeems quite soon for a deload personally and I don't know if it is the need for a deload or if my life just needs me to drop the volume a bit(which is what I'm currently leaning towards, dropped from 3x frequency to 2x frequency effectively reducing the volume by a third, so I guess I'll see how this goes)\n\nNot sure if this practice is like letting the fatigue dissipate bit by bit instead of just letting it all out in one go?  And if there is anyone who has been successful in achieving great strength while not having planned 1 week deloads.. I'd be interest to hear your thoughts.\n\n\nTLDR: Can I just deload a certain muscle group or skip a certain workout if I feel wrecked and still get strength gains or are planned week long deloads necessary?","upvote_ratio":0.8,"created_utc":1676236326.0},{"title":"Leg routine progression without barbell or dumbbell","author":"According-Range-2807","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/bodyweightfitness\/comments\/110q62l\/leg_routine_progression_without_barbell_or\/","text":" I am firmly convinced that the best way to exercise for the human body is to exercise with your own body weight. One of the challenges is leg and glute training. Legs and gluteal muscles adapt to loads very quickly and at one point the weight of your own body becomes limiting. I don't see anything wrong with using weighted vests and elastic bands to solve the problem of loading the lower part of the body, and for advanced exercisers also the upper part of the body. This way of exercising encourages us to be creative, to discover new ways of exercising, and it is certainly more interesting than routines in gyms and monotonous exercise equipment. When talking about leg training, the barbell squat is often cited as the foundation of progress. This is somewhat true if you are a professional bodybuilder. My opinion is that the Bulgarian squats are the most complete exercise for the legs (partially also the gluteal muscles) and if I had to choose only one exercise for the legs, it would be the Bulgarian squats. There are also all versions of lunges, one-legged squats and unilateral RDL for glute. Trust me, if after a well-done leg workout you finish off with 3 more sets of regular squats with up to 30 repetitions in each set and when you feel that pump and feeling of fire in your legs, you'll understand what I'm talking about. Bulgarian squats and lunges are most responsible for the shape of my legs. Unilateral exercises are extremely mentally demanding because practically every set is done in a superset for both legs, and that is why a large number of exercisers avoid them","upvote_ratio":0.71,"created_utc":1676235676.0},{"title":"Is my 1 year progress good?","author":"Yehonatan753","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/bodyweightfitness\/comments\/110o4za\/is_my_1_year_progress_good\/","text":"I (16m), been training for a year and now, starting weight was 60 kg, went on a bulk of 3 months got myself to 64 kg then went on a cut to 56 kg (Lost an insane amount of fat), and have bulked up from 56 kg to 71 kg in 6 months, is this good?  \nNote: For some reason, my local gym (this is the only gym where I live) only accepts people at the age of 16 and above, and I started when I was 15 so I went to a personal trainer, the progress was fine for 3 months but from then it was super slow and really not much gain in muscle.

It insulates you from injuries during high-impact activities, and affects your upper body aesthetics. With the right bodyweight exercises, you can build a strong and healthy neck without the need for any equipment. In this post, I'll go over best practices for safe and efficient progression in your neck training. \n\n**For Best Results**\n\nNeck and upper traps have a lot of overlap,  I suggest training them both at the same time to maximize results. Make sure to stretch your neck and traps after exercising them to avoid being tense. [https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/bodyweightfitness\/comments\/viayu5\/upper\\_trap\\_training\\_with\\_calisthenics\\_a\\_breakdown\/](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/bodyweightfitness\/comments\/viayu5\/upper_trap_training_with_calisthenics_a_breakdown\/)\n\n**Important Things To Know** \n\n* **Equipment is not needed.** The muscles of the neck are actually some of the easiest and most convenient to train, since you can do all the key exercises with no equipment, while either laying on the floor or hanging off the edge of a bed. \n   * This no-equipment style of neck workout was a staple of training for old-time strongmen and wrestlers such as Martin \"Farmer\" Burns, famous for a stunt where he survived hanging himself due to his absurd neck strength.  I am not always one to claim that \"old school\" did it better, but in this case the old school athletes seemed to have figured it out. [https:\/\/lastwordonsports.com\/prowrestling\/2019\/08\/27\/the-pioneers-martin-farmer-burns-the-godfather-of-pro-wrestling\/](https:\/\/lastwordonsports.com\/prowrestling\/2019\/08\/27\/the-pioneers-martin-farmer-burns-the-godfather-of-pro-wrestling\/) \n   * This should be obvious, but **do not try to replicate that stunt.** \n* **Neck bridges are not needed**. Neck bridges put extra strain on the fragile vertebrae of your cervical spine, while being entirely unneeded to have consistent neck strength gains. They are uncomfortable, risky, and are harder to progress\/regress than other options. Instead I'll be showing some much lower risk exercise options.\n\n**Adding Resistance**\n\nProgression for neck training should be focused on fatiguing the muscles rather than maximum load.  Therefore, prioritize *training volume, slowing tempo and pauses, increasing ROM, and shortening rest periods between sets.* \n\n If you do still wish to load the neck, a light resistance band and\/or resistance from placing your hands on your head as muscular resistance is  very simple and easy to implement. Add load very *gradually.*  Here is an example [https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=lWKMy4BETQM](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=lWKMy4BETQM) \n\nHighly advanced trainees can feel free to use small weight plates (2-6 kg), but if you're someone with a large and heavy head it's unlikely you'll ever need anything more than just bodyweight and perhaps a light band.\n\n**Gold Standard for Progression**\n\nSlow sets of 15-20 reps at a paused tempo of 1-3-1-1, perform all neck exercises as a giant set running through each exercise 1 time with no rest between for 2-4 rounds. \n\nThe majority of people, if they are strict with form and not allowing their neck to relax during the giant set, will find this quite challenging. If you still manage to progress beyond this, then you should consider adding load.\n\n**Neck Exercises** \n\nRegardless of the variation you use, make sure to train all the key movements of the neck like you would the muscles of your core: rotation, side bending, forward bending, and backward extending. \n\n**Front\/Side of Neck Training**  [https:\/\/youtu.be\/XgNGiDMS2DE](https:\/\/youtu.be\/XgNGiDMS2DE) \n\n**Neck Training Advanced (non-floor) Progressions**, [https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=lWKMy4BETQM](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=lWKMy4BETQM)\n\n**Rear Neck Training**: [https:\/\/youtu.be\/KsKYRvOu0Cw](https:\/\/youtu.be\/KsKYRvOu0Cw)","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1676025400.0},{"title":"Can someone pls help me with a routine :,)","author":"russianvodkawhore","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/bodyweightfitness\/comments\/10z8oob\/can_someone_pls_help_me_with_a_routine\/","text":"Okay so I\u2019m just going to put down my weight, age, goals, diet, and my current routine.

We will primarily look at exercises to target the lats, mid-back, and scapula, as well as a few accessories with high carryover to pulling movements. \n\n**A Common Mistake With Back Training**\n\nIn the pursuit of impressive bodyweight skills like the front lever, do not abandon the foundational exercises of pullups and rowing once you get to an intermediate or advanced level of strength. They are not as flashy, but just because they are simple does not mean they are ineffective. Continue to improve your rowing and pullup strength to optimize your training of isometric skills. \n\n**Adding Weight and Resistance Bands**\n\nTo help strengthen the back muscles, use weight vests or dip belts as extra load. \n\nBands resistance should be utilized for horizontal pulling exercises whenever possible, since they improve the resistance curve of the movements. Otherwise, the movements are less challenging at the top of the exercise.  FitnessFAQs has a good video explaining this idea further: [https:\/\/youtu.be\/S3XfhC4P4ks](https:\/\/youtu.be\/S3XfhC4P4ks)\n\nFuthermore, bands are useful because the back muscles respond well to maximum contraction, and they can help build good motor patterns by avoiding the use of momentum to \"cheat\" a movement. For these last two reasons, I also suggest using bands for vertical pulling as an accessory to the traditional pullup exercise. In the case of vertical pulling, band-resisted pullups do not need to be the entirety of your pullup training, they are just a helpful and challenging accessory movement. \n\n**Note on Pullups vs. Chinups**\n\nAs pullups and chinups are the same exercise with different grip positions, I make no distinction between them in this post. You may choose an overhand, neutral, or underhand grip as you see fit. That being said, there are different areas of the back emphasized by grip and hand width, so I recommend using more than one to add some variance to your training. \n\n**Front Lever (Straight Arm Pulling Strength)**\n\nThese exercises require mastery of the front lever progression you'll be training, and very strong pulling strength. Front lever training is not required to build back strength, but since it is a staple of many programs, I am including it. **Not for beginnners.**\n\nIce Cream Makers:\n\n* [https:\/\/youtu.be\/pgX9kMxHmsc?t=679](https:\/\/youtu.be\/pgX9kMxHmsc?t=679)\n* [https:\/\/thehybridathlete.com\/ice-cream-makers\/#What\\_They\\_Are\\_Good\\_For](https:\/\/thehybridathlete.com\/ice-cream-makers\/#What_They_Are_Good_For)\n\nFront Lever Raise: \n\n[https:\/\/youtu.be\/pgX9kMxHmsc?t=606](https:\/\/youtu.be\/pgX9kMxHmsc?t=606)\n\n**Rows (Horizontal Pulling)**\n\nThe row is sometimes overlooked in calisthenics in favor of the pullup, when really it is a movement of immense value.  I suspect this is because the bodyweight row progressions beyond an intermediate level are not as straightforward as the pullup. Also, they're not complex, flashy, or a \"high skill\" movement. Those things are actually some of the major *advantages* of training the row, but I digress.\n\n**A Few Lesser-Known Benefits of The Bodyweight Row:** [**https:\/\/youtu.be\/dYRnvrWcz8w**](https:\/\/youtu.be\/dYRnvrWcz8w) \n\n**Another note:** The ceiling for horizontal pulling strength is *much* *higher* than it is for vertical pulling strength. Examples: [https:\/\/youtu.be\/GKi5-BRoiDY](https:\/\/youtu.be\/GKi5-BRoiDY) [https:\/\/youtu.be\/99nu3TywFdQ](https:\/\/youtu.be\/99nu3TywFdQ) What this means is that if you are not incorporating heavy rowing into your pulling work, you're leaving a huge amount of strength potential unrealized. Overcome your fear of gains and start rowing.\n\n**Where to Start with Your Rows**\n\n* **A General Rowing Progression Guid**e: [http:\/\/www.startbodyweight.com\/p\/horizontal-pulls-progression.html](http:\/\/www.startbodyweight.com\/p\/horizontal-pulls-progression.html)\n* After the beginner progressions, you can begin to train with weight vests, as well as incorporating front lever rows and unilateral variations. Bands should be incorporated early for resistance.\n\n**Unilateral Row Variations** \n\nUnilateral work is a great way to build strength without needing to do a front lever or having a lot of added weight. However, I still strongly recommend the band for one arm row variations. They fix the resistance curve and mitigate some of the body rotation that happens with one arm variations. \n\nOne Arm One Leg Row\n\n* [https:\/\/youtu.be\/PH9-nQ7Lu2I](https:\/\/youtu.be\/PH9-nQ7Lu2I)\n* Regression (Two arms one leg row): [https:\/\/youtu.be\/iGzfuXd85R0](https:\/\/youtu.be\/iGzfuXd85R0)\n* An advanced pulling variation. Similar to the one arm pullup, in that you are lifting most of your bodyweight with one arm. I have not tested it for this purpose, but I suspect it would be a very useful stepping stone to the one arm pullup.\n\nOne Arm Row\n\n* [https:\/\/youtu.be\/bzmdmqmf39U?t=201](https:\/\/youtu.be\/bzmdmqmf39U?t=201) \n* The standard to aim for with unilateral horizontal pulling. \n\nArcher Row\n\n* [https:\/\/youtu.be\/4g8CM9pV4X4](https:\/\/youtu.be\/4g8CM9pV4X4)\n* A good starting point with unilateral work. \n\n**Front Lever Rows** \n\n* Front-Lever Rows allow you to row with your full bodyweight, providing a challenging stimulus. More advanced front lever variations have worse leverage, making them harder. These cannot be band-resisted very easily, but a weight vest can still be used, particularly for tuck and l-sit variations. \n* Several Progressions: [https:\/\/youtu.be\/Peax8Xu4m04](https:\/\/youtu.be\/Peax8Xu4m04) \n* L-Row [https:\/\/youtu.be\/eZxjpg3DLGU](https:\/\/youtu.be\/eZxjpg3DLGU) \n   * This is my favorite front lever row variation, as it is easy enough that it be can be trained in a higher rep range than most of the options. It can also be combined with a weight vest for advanced trainees, which does not work as well with more advanced front lever variations. \n\n**Pullups (Vertical Pulling)**\n\n**Resistance Band Pullups**\n\n* Here is an example of the resistance band pullup. I started using these after reading a write-up on the band-resisted pullup by Ross Enamait [https:\/\/rosstraining.com\/blog\/2015\/08\/band-resisted-pull-ups\/](https:\/\/rosstraining.com\/blog\/2015\/08\/band-resisted-pull-ups\/)\n* If you don't know who Ross is, he's the author of Never Gymless (a book currently for sale for $1 on his website), boxing trainer, and a physical specimen [https:\/\/youtu.be\/F2KhOikihvE](https:\/\/youtu.be\/F2KhOikihvE)\n\n**Gironda Pullup Progressions**\n\nThe gironda pullup is easily of the most challenging two arm pullup variations that can be done. Note that the gironda pullup is far more challenging than the arched back pullup. You will most likely need to spend a lot of time with weighted arched back pullups, gradually increasing the arch. \n\nGironda Pullup\n\n* [https:\/\/youtu.be\/STqWO-kYEnw](https:\/\/youtu.be\/STqWO-kYEnw)\n* An advanced pullup variation that requires a great amount of scapula strength as you are pulling your torso from vertical to a nearly horizontal angle. This is similar to the Arched Back pullup, only the pulling and arching are much more extreme. Emphasis shifts from the biceps to the back (don't worry, the biceps are still stimulated). \n* **Not beginner-friendly,** do not attempt if you have not mastered the arched back pullup.\n* Advice for mastering the movement pattern: [https:\/\/youtu.be\/fEpiU5YuTDc?t=492](https:\/\/youtu.be\/fEpiU5YuTDc?t=492)\n\nArched Back\/Sternum Pullup\n\n* Also known as the \"perfect pullup\", this pullup requires an arched back and lots of protraction and retraction to do correctly. They are more challenging than they look. Ideally, your chest should touch the bar with each rep, and include a brief pause to maximally contract at the top. \n* [https:\/\/youtube.com\/shorts\/Cpt\\_pDuNL6k?feature=share](https:\/\/youtube.com\/shorts\/Cpt_pDuNL6k?feature=share)\n* These were a favorite of 2x Mr. Olympia Franco Columbu, and some would say he had a pretty good back. [https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/bodybuilding\/comments\/ed6jiu\/franco\\_columbu\\_doing\\_his\\_unweighted\\_pull\\_ups\/?sort=top](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/bodybuilding\/comments\/ed6jiu\/franco_columbu_doing_his_unweighted_pull_ups\/?sort=top) \n\nFrenchie Pullup \n\n* [https:\/\/youtu.be\/Zz8JBOoCBVQ](https:\/\/youtu.be\/Zz8JBOoCBVQ)\n* Focus on the isometric scapula contractions at each positions. Later progressions have a huge demand on scapula protraction\/retraction.\n* I also recommend training active hangs and bodyweight batwings as assistance work. \n\n**Unilateral Pullup Variations**\n\nStarting Option: Archer Pullup\n\n* Use the archer pullup as your beginning unilateral pullup before moving on to one of the options below. It is not a very similar movement to many of the exercises below, but it does ensure that you have sufficient pulling strength to move to the more advanced variations.\n* Rings Variation: [https:\/\/youtu.be\/H49htfRg6Tw](https:\/\/youtu.be\/H49htfRg6Tw)\n* Bar Variation: [https:\/\/youtu.be\/NuqcoOAsTMA](https:\/\/youtu.be\/NuqcoOAsTMA) \n\n**Option 1**: One Arm Pullup Progressions\n\nOne Arm L Sit Pullup \n\n* [https:\/\/youtu.be\/-mFROOBeXaA?t=95](https:\/\/youtu.be\/-mFROOBeXaA?t=95)\n* The L-Sit position adds a more challenging leverage to the one arm pullup\n\nOne Arm Pullup \n\n* [https:\/\/youtu.be\/mTJHClMQPM8](https:\/\/youtu.be\/mTJHClMQPM8)\n\nAssisted One Arm Pullup \n\n* Assisted + Negative (More Advanced)[https:\/\/youtu.be\/eZxjpg3DLGU](https:\/\/youtu.be\/eZxjpg3DLGU) \n* [https:\/\/youtu.be\/FZPjwl1NSdI](https:\/\/youtu.be\/FZPjwl1NSdI)\n* Move your hand lower on the towel for less assistance in the movement.\n\nUneven Pullup\n\n* [https:\/\/youtu.be\/fCHcb4MB1FM](https:\/\/youtu.be\/fCHcb4MB1FM) \n\n**Option 2:** Cliffhanger Pullup Progressions\n\n* Cliffhangers are less intense than the other options, but also much easier to add load to than other unilateral pullup exercises. I recommend this for heavier trainees wanting to incorporate unilateral work. You can use a weight vest or weights and a dip belt fairly easily.  \n\nArcher Cliffhanger Pullup\n\n* [https:\/\/youtu.be\/9FN4Z26kPVY?t=74](https:\/\/youtu.be\/9FN4Z26kPVY?t=74)\n* A progression with more challenging leverage, move your front hand further away from your body to make it harder. \n\nCliffhanger Pullup\n\n* [https:\/\/youtu.be\/yS2F17REkPo](https:\/\/youtu.be\/yS2F17REkPo)\n* Make sure to alternate which hand is in front and which is in back.\n* For better results (less of a break in between reps) complete all your reps on one side, then switch hands to work the other side. Alternate which side you start with for each set.\n\n**Option 3:** Rope Climbing Progressions\n\nRope climbs can be trained for speed, strength, or endurance. Speed involves climbing as fast as you can, strength would be climbing with as challenge of a leverage as possible (or added weight), and endurance would be climbing for long sets to build up tolerance to muscular fatigue. \n\nInverted Rope Climb \n\n* [https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=RndGhDB5KXs](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=RndGhDB5KXs)\n* This is where it gets gnarly, make sure you are very confident in your rope climbing before attempting. \n\nStraddle\/L-Sit Rope Climb\n\n* More challenging leverage for the rope climb\n* [https:\/\/youtu.be\/8w95Vwn9T8E](https:\/\/youtu.be\/8w95Vwn9T8E) \n* [https:\/\/youtu.be\/AINKDQrGUJI](https:\/\/youtu.be\/AINKDQrGUJI)\n\nRope Climb\n\n* [https:\/\/youtu.be\/1\\_oY4NdgnFY](https:\/\/youtu.be\/1_oY4NdgnFY)\n* The goal is to eventually get to a point of no leg assistance in the movement (gripping the rope with your lower body). \n\nAdditional Rope Climb Variations: [https:\/\/youtu.be\/5\\_TY1IHvmKc](https:\/\/youtu.be\/5_TY1IHvmKc)\n\n**Accessory Work**\n\nA list of accessory exercises to help you progress with your pulling. If your biceps and forearms tend to hit failure before your back muscles are fully fatigued, implement some of these variations for extra volume.\n\n**Lats Accessories**\n\nResistance Band Gironda Row\n\n* A very intense and often forgotten lat exercise. Can be trained using a resistance band or cables. Can also be trained unilaterally. Grip at different widths to target different parts of the back.\n* [https:\/\/youtu.be\/Ssezv4WyJ9c](https:\/\/youtu.be\/Ssezv4WyJ9c)\n* [https:\/\/physicalculturestudy.com\/2017\/04\/18\/forgotten-bodybuilding-exercises-the-gironda-motorcycle-row\/](https:\/\/physicalculturestudy.com\/2017\/04\/18\/forgotten-bodybuilding-exercises-the-gironda-motorcycle-row\/)\n* Bodyweight Rings Version: Replicate the rings lat slide exercise (see below), but instead of keeping arms straight, do the motion of the gironda row. If done right, your back will be very fatigued.\n\nResistance Band Lat Pulldowns\n\n* [https:\/\/youtu.be\/bLZQ7tBJYQ4?t=167](https:\/\/youtu.be\/bLZQ7tBJYQ4?t=167)\n\nResistance Band Behind The Neck Pulldown\n\n* [https:\/\/youtu.be\/0cv9bht0rdk](https:\/\/youtu.be\/0cv9bht0rdk)\n* Hold band with narrow grip and pull hands apart as you are pulling downward.\n\nResistance Band Lying Pullover\n\n* [https:\/\/youtu.be\/I3b8FyV9vZQ](https:\/\/youtu.be\/I3b8FyV9vZQ)\n\nResistance Band Standing Straight Arm Pullover\n\n* [https:\/\/youtu.be\/LfGyMCw\\_Zd0](https:\/\/youtu.be\/LfGyMCw_Zd0)\n* Avoid cheating with momentum.\n\nRing Straight Arm Pullover\n\n* A challenging bodyweight variation of the pullover exercises (the weights one not the transition movement). Useful as an accessory that does not put stress on your biceps and forearms. \n\n\nBodyweight Lat Slide\n\n* For best results, use gymnastics rings and have a resistance band loaded at your hip to increase difficulty.\n* Focus on using your lats as much as possible and not turning this into an ab rollout.\n* [https:\/\/youtu.be\/pgX9kMxHmsc?t=377](https:\/\/youtu.be\/pgX9kMxHmsc?t=377)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Mid Back & Scapula Accessories**\n\nThere is some overlap with posterior and lateral deltoid exercises listed in my deltoid training post.
