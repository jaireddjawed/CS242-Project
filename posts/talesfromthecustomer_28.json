To preface this, I currently work in the store this takes place in, but it takes place years before I started working there.\n\nAll throughout elementary and jr high, I went to a school that required a uniform. This uniform happened to be identical to the uniform at the local grocery store. \n\nOne day, after school, my brother and I stopped by to grab something before going home. We were unfamiliar with the store, and wandered around for a bit looking for what we needed. After a few minutes, I feel a jab on my shoulder.\n\nAt this time in my life, I was under five feet tall, and had a backpack *with my school's name on it* hanging off my back. I turned around, and was greeted by a store employee.\n\nHe looked down at me, scowled, and said, \"You need to get back to work.\"\n\nI turned around fully to face him, and retorted, \"I'm twelve.\" Then sauntered off to find my brother.\n\nWe found what we needed, checked out, and went home.",

        "text": "A couple of days ago I stopped at my local supermarket to pick up a few things\n\nI went through the self serve isle because I figured it would be quicker but when I got my receipt I noticed a couple two liter bottles of soda rang up at the regular price not the sale that was running that week\n\nSo I went to the consumer service station that was manned by two teen girls...I quietly explained the situation and they immediately froze with panic in their eyes\n\nWhile they stood there trembling I was reminded of mice I had seen that had been caught and 'played' with by one of our cats...too scared to run and too scared to do anything but sit there twitching in fear\n\nI immediately told them I had gone through the self serve register and any problem was of MY own doing some how and NOT the store's fault or theirs\n\nIt turns out the soda was on sale but with a coupon from the flyer and I had not  ran the flyer through the register so it didn't know to knock the price down...in total it was just a buck but it was my buck and I wanted it back\n\nApparently unbeknownst to me the register automatically knows what's on sale except for any coupons(for those you must scan the code on the ad)\n\nThey got a supervisor there quickly and it was fixed in no time all the while even the supe was apologizing profusely for something that was in no way their fault\n\nThe point of this story is during the entire interaction I had with these three employees of the store they practically had bright neon signs over their heads broadcasting their easy victim hood and if I had been the type of person inclined to take advantage of them...they fully expected me to throw a tantrum and they'd be forced to kiss my ass to appease me\n\nThis made me wonder...is every customer who abuses an employee really evil?  Or are they like a cat playing with a mouse because they know the person is by their job defenseless and easy prey?\n\nMy go to analogy here is supose you are walking along and find a hundred dollar bill on the sidewalk?  Do you turn it in or pocket it?  \n\nIn a million years you wouldn't rob someone for that money or if the money found was in a wallet you'd contact the owner but easy money fund on the ground I maintain most people would pocket it with no moral qualms\n\nThe same thing with how you treat others...in the many interactions you had every day with others the vast majority of them are polite but them a minor FUBAR occurs with someone you know is not allowed to defend themselves\n\nNow every slight or petty aggravation you suffered that day can be put on someone who has to take it or be fired\n\nNow I have no doubt most of these people are simply dicks and deserve our condemnation but some(maybe no even that many) are just having a bad day \n\nI used to drive a cab and often I'd get a fare who was let's say 'cranky'...I understood most people  the expense of taking a taxi but because of certain circumstances in their life(maybe a DUI or car being repaired or divorce...who knows what else) they need a ride but aren't happy about it\n\nI'd give them a minor pass for their behavior but due to the fact this is MY car for 12 hours and I had sole digression as to who got to ride with me(I could kick them out with no repercussions from the owner of the company...I had driven for them long enough they trusted my decision on these matters)\n\nBTW Knowing I could bounce them I rarely needed to do so...the threat of doing so was usually enough\n\nThe thing is while the vast amount of what seemed like jerks ended up being nice people who were just having a shitty day and mistakenly thought they could pass it on to me\n\nI don't really have a solution for this problem as long as employees of these big companies have to live with rules seemingly made specifically to make their front line people vulnerable to the assholes of the world",

Some woman comes in, walks up to the counter - there are three employees hurriedly making sandwiches. \n\nShe starts reeling off her exact specifications - and I mean exact. It needed some of this, but not too much.  Just one shake of pepper, blah blah blah, I mean you would think this was her final meal on death row or something. \n\nWhile she's doing this the employee is hurriedly throwing together a sandwich.  I'm standing next to her, with someone making my sandwich, and I notice he isn't following her extensive list of precise instructions. But she doesn't notice. I figure this will get entertaining. \n\nSo she finished with \"and don't cut my sandwich in half.\"  \n\nNot five seconds after she says this, he's slicing the sandwich he just made in half. She has a total meltdown. \"I told you, you stupid !@##$%$\" etc. \n\nGuy calmly looks at her and says, \"Ma'am, this isn't your sandwich. I haven't made yours yet.\"\n\nOwner walks over. He says something to the effect of is there a problem.  She starts complaining - and he cuts her off. \"Ma'am, I heard the whole thing. You were rude to my employee, and we don't need your business. Please leave.\" She stood there, can't recall if she sputtered anything or not, until he pointed to the door and added, \"Now\". \n\nIt was beautiful. \n",

        "text": "I went shopping at my normal grocery store last night for just normal groceries. I got pretty normal stuff and not a bunch of big or especially delicate items. Some of the things I got are milk,  orange juice, chips, bread, butter, yogurt, lunch meat, cheese, tortilla shells, ground beef, bananas, grapes, salad, crackers, and whatever other random things so nothing unusual. I think the biggest thing I got was the salad because it was in a big plastic container but it still is small enough to where there is plenty of space in a bag for a couple other things.\n\nThe cashier is unusually slow but whatever, it's not a big deal and she has a bagger. I put my groceries on the belt with the frozen stuff together, the cold stuff together, the produce together, and the crushable stuff at the end as I always do to make it easier to bag. The bagger isn't paying much attention to what he's doing and talking to someone else a couple checkouts over. Annoying but again not all that unusual and not really a big deal.\n\nOther than making sure I got all my groceries off the checkout I don't pay much attention to the bags in my cart before I get out to my car. I start loading everything into my trunk and I notice that all the bags are awfully light and there an awful lot of bags. \n\nNow as I'm getting the groceries out of my trunk at home I decided I was going to count how many bags they actually used since it takes forever to find all the handles of the bags so I can carry the groceries in. I finally get inside and make a pile out of all the bags as I put stuff away. Counting the bags at the end shows that I had 23 bags (technically 24 actually if you count the paper wine bottle bag). TWENTY FOUR BAGS!! At the bottom of my receipt it shows my total number of items... \"Items purchased: 48\"\n\nNow I always recycle my bags but that is still massively wasteful! I know I should really just bring in the reusable bags but I always forget. The plastic bags are still free in my area so I don't have much incentive to remember. I used to bag groceries at my last job and I don't think I'd have needed more than maybe 10 bags for the groceries I had.\n\nTL;DR Received 24 bags when purchasing 48 items, none of which were particularly bulky or delicate.",

I have vision and mobility problems. My grandson always gives me his arm and kind of helps me by leading and supporting me.  My granddaughter takes my hand and helps that way.  Both of them eat quietly and we have a nice conversation.\n\nSo the gentleman of the couple came to our table and said how much they enjoyed how nice my grandchildren were and wanted to pay our bill.  I didn't want to accept, but it was too late, he had already done it.\n\nSo a few nights ago, my husband and I went there and decided that we would like to do the same thing.  We picked a table kind of at random and told the server that we wanted to pay the ticket for them.  Next thing I know, the server is going to that table and telling them that we had paid their ticket and pointing to us!  We kind of ducked and fled the restaurant.\n\nI thought it was just SOP that these things were in secret, unless someone chooses to walk up and explain why they did it?  We liked the idea of paying it forward, but I guess we have to tell the server that it's a secret when we do it in future.\n\nP.S.  I hope this works out well for the server.  I added a tip for both tabs when I was paying.  I added a tip for what we would have paid when the nice couple paid our bill.  I would hope that every party would always both leave an appropriate tip.\n\nNot a particularly thrilling story, but I thought I'd pass on what I learned about the actual procedure.  Make sure the server knows you don't want to be pointed out if you want to avoid that awkward moment.",

        "text": "This happened recently and I've already posted the story in one place but thought it may be suited better in here. \n\nAnyway if your are in the UK or Australia then you may happen to know what a 'News agent' is. Basically they are a little store that sells magazines, papers, lottery tickets etc.  A certain store that shall remain nameless has earned a story in this sub. \n\nStory goes is that me and my Friend were at an news agency in town and decided to take a look at the magazines and buy one before we would head off to grab a bite. We went into the Agency and I had a look to see what magazine would earn my purchase (I was only intending to get one because they can get upwards of $20 here which is pretty pricey for a magazine IMO) Now while this agency isn't very big there was a truck load of different magazines to look at and what fesses me the most is Computer and photoshopping ones but I felt some magazines just didn't live up to quality (Like poorly written or too much crap in it not worth reading) We must of been there for 3 minuets or so before the shop keeper has a go at me and my friend telling us in an angry tone 'That there is a library across the street if you want to read, we don't take kindly to people coming in and using this place as a library and walking out'.  \n\nNow that caught me off guard and I looked at the shop keeper and he was looking at me, I just put down the magazine and walked out, friend and I went and got lunch and for some reason I just couldn't stop talking to him about how poorly we were just spoken too, yes this place is no library (Which we weren't even using it for)  but I don't want to pay $20 for something and find out the magazine is a steaming pile of poorly published crap and I didn't have the chance to find out it was crap because the shop keeper told me not to read it here. \n\nAnyway we eventually got lunch and I say that for once It looks like as a customer I'll be standing up for myself and telling them I won't accept being spoken too like that.  I tell my friend as soon as we finish lunch we are going back over there and I'm going to speak my mind. \n\nLunch finished and we walk back over to the agency, and see them serving a customer so I wait in line, customer leaves and I asked them who was the person who spoke to me rudely xx amount of minuets ago about not using this place as a library?  I said library because that's what shop keeper said. \n\nShop keeper says it was him and then I say that I really didn't appreciate the way you spoke to me and I felt I had to come back and let you know I won't be spoken too that way as that's how you lose customers out the door. Guy goes into a spill how he's had people come in, read shit and leave without buying crap and I say that's understandable and that was not my intentions but what I don't find understandable is the manner you spoke to me in, he wouldn't answer why he spoke to me in such a tone but then says 'Well if you were going to buy something then why didn't you tell me?' \n\nSo now I'm obliged to tell the shop keeper I'm going to buy something because other screwtards have screwed the system for everyone else? \n\nI don't remember what I said but I really should of said something along the lines of -  'Well that's my decision to say when I'm ready to buy, not yours, I mean the local supermarket wouldn't kick me out would they, because I was looking around for half hour seeing what I could buy?'. I get your an independent business and this is your life's work probably but not all customers should be treated guilty or spoken too like this just because they are browsing at what to buy, you have a truck load of stuff here so I think I would appreciated the moment to see what is worth my money. \n\nAlso mentioned to them that I'll be taking my business elsewhere and will be supporting other agency's that don't treat all of their potential / customers like crap. Heard from chatter the 2nd time I went in they are shutting down or something and after being treated like that all I can say is 'Good ridden'. \n\nHate on me all you want but I felt the need in the end to tell a Shop keeper I will NOT accept being spoken too like a dog and I feel pretty good for speaking up for myself. \n\ntl;dr - taking a look at magazines and was going to buy one, shop keeper tells us in an angry tone like speaking to a dog to go to the library instead if you want to read, I later come back and tell them not to speak to me like crap, end result is it felt good to speak up on telling them not to speak to me or my friend like crap.

        "text": "My husband and I shop at a national grocery chain that uses a barcoded key tag to allow the customer to earn points for purchases and redeem digital coupons. We both have key tags for this grocery on our key chains, but I never scan mine at the grocery. Instead, I key in our alternate number. \n\nRecently, I had my husband stop by the grocery to pick up some items on his way home from work. Many of the things I wanted him to get had digital coupons loaded on our account. He walked through the store, mobile phone to his ear, and gathered all of the items from my list. He went to the self-checkout register, scanned his key tag, scanned the items, and paid. \n\nHere is my problem: Whenever I shop at a store...especially if I am doing self-check, I always verify that the prices are correct and that any coupons have come off the total. My husband does not. He just listens for the beep, pays no attention to the scanned price, and swipes his card. \n\nWhen he got home an hour and a half later (huge work commute), I scanned over the receipt. Around $20 worth of coupons (all of the ones that should have applied) were not deducted. The receipt showed that a key tag had been scanned, but when I looked at the key tag number on the receipt, it did not match the key tag number on his key chain. Upon further inspection, it **did** match the number on a gas station key tag on my husband's key chain. He had inadvertently scanned the wrong key tag, and our gas station rewards account evidently had the same number as someone else's grocery rewards account!\n\nThe next day my husband took the receipt and the offending gas station key tag back to the grocery in an effort to get the situation remedied. The goal was to see if the store would refund the items on the wrong account, rescan them on our account, and refund the difference. The customer service reps and manager acted like this would be impossible, but, personally, I think they just didn't want to put any effort into it. \n\nThe next day we went to a location of the store closer to our home and repurchased all of the digital coupon items  using our alternate number instead of the key tag. A day or two after that, my husband took back one set of the items back to the original store with his receipt.

        "text": "This is a tale about something that I witnessed today when I was in line at the grocery store. I get in line, and there is an elderly woman trying to pay for her groceries. Evidently,  she gave the cashier her change purse, and asked her to count how much change was in there. The cashier  tediously counted the change, and told the lady that she had eight dollars.  She handed the change purse back to the old lady. The old lady then gave her a check, and the cashier ran the blank check through the register to fill it out. Then, the old lady looks aghast because she realized that the eight dollars and change had not been used.  The poor cashier was frustrated and somewhat embarrassed about the situation. The old lady was indignant that her change it not been applied for the purchase. A manager had to come over and explain that the check is already been processed, and that's all there was to it. \n\n I could somewhat understand the old lady's perspective, why would she give the change to the cashier if she didn't want it applied to the purchase? However, she should've paid attention to the full change purse that she received it back.  Plus, I think that it is up to the shop or to count his or her money prior to shopping. It feels rude to make a cashier count your money for you. \n\nThe cashier was a very frustrated, and she kept muttering to herself about the old lady as she checked out my groceries. I tried to be very sympathetic, as I had been a retail cashier years ago myself.\n\nEdit: I did feel bad for BOTH parties. I think the cashier was embarrassed because DUH the money was to go on the bill, and she totally dropped the ball. \n\nThe store was one of those stores where you put a quarter in the cart to use it (getting it back when it's returned to the store front) and you bag your own groceries. The old lady was still slowly loading her grocerie into her car when I pulled out of the lot. I can understand why due to age / slowness / arthritis she was unable to quickly count the change herself. At no point did I lose my patience while I waited. I was just observing.\n\nIt might have helped the old lady to have driven by the bank drive thru before grocery shopping to deposit her change into her checking account or exchange for cash. Most banks have coin machines that will continue for you.\n\nBottom line: I was just a witness.",

        "text": "\nA few years ago, I wanted to by my then BF a watch he'd been drooling over for his birthday. Not a jewelry type watch, but one of those nerd watches with a million and one buttons and functions. \n\nBeing a responsible consumer, I did some comparison shopping. I found a small mom-and-pop electronics store that had a few, selling for less than their competitors. The store was on the edge of a somewhat sketchy neighborhood, but it was not far off my route home, so I decided to give it a try. \n\nI go to the store, buy the watch. No problems. \n\nA few weeks later, when I give the watch to my BF, we discover that there's no instruction manual in the box. Not any papers at all. No warranty card. Nothing. \n\nOh, great. This is going to be a hassle. It's not like you can intuitively figure out a watch like this. There's no instruction manual online, and even if there was, how would I know what else is missing? And it's not like I bought the watch yesterday. It's been weeks. *sigh*\n\nI call the shop. The woman who answers the phone is very helpful. She tells me to bring in everything, watch and box, so they can figure out what's missing. \n\nNext day, I stop by on my lunch hour. Tell the clerk what I need. He's acting a bit strange, like he's uncomfortable. I'm thinking he must be new to the job. He looks at the watch, checks the model number, then asks me for the sales receipt. \n\nI'm a little confused. I tell him I'm not returning it or anything. I just need the papers that should've been in the box. When I talked to the person on the phone, they didn't tell me I needed to bring the receipt. \n\nClerk tells me he can't do anything unless he knows I purchased it at that store. \n\nOkay, fair enough. I tell him I don't have the receipt with me, but I'll return tomorrow after I have a chance to hunt it up. He tells me I need to come after 5pm, because that's when the person I need to speak with will be working. \n\nI'm more irritated now, because I'm not all that crazy about being in that neighborhood at night....but, okay. \n\nNext evening, I pull up to the store shortly after 5pm. There's not another car in the parking lot. The parking lot lights are off, which I think is a little odd, but I've not been there at night, so maybe it's normal. I park right in front of the store, where the only light is. \n\nGather my stuff and go into the store. There's a policeman standing right inside the door, which comforts me because that dark, deserted parking lot has raised my hackles. Policemen is in full uniform, including gun, and standing like a guard at the entrance. \n\nI walk over to the counter, to the same man I'd talked to the day before. He still looks uncomfortable so I give him a smile. \n\nMan: Did you bring your receipt?\n\nMe: Got it right here. Did you find the instruction manual? \n\nMan: Let me take a look at the receipt. \n\nI hand it over. He examines it carefully. Very carefully. Reads everything on it. Holds it up to the light. \n\nThen he looks over at the policemen and says, \"Yep. It's a real receipt.\" \n\nPoliceman smiles and nods, then leaves. \n\nBy now, I'm standing there with my mouth hanging open because I've finally realized *they think I stole the watch*. Not only that, the policeman that I was so comforted to find in the shop was actually waiting to arrest me....and wait! That's why there were no cars in the parking lot and no other customers in the store. \n\nAs this slowly comes together in my head, I gape at the clerk. \"You thought???\" \n\nHe grins sheepishly and says, \"We had a break in a few days ago. Took all of the watches just like this one.\" \n\n\n\n\n",

The boyfriend and I got stuck at our respective jobs past the end of our shifts so we decided to order some grub from our favorite mexican place using a delivery service. Service says it'll take about an hour. No big deal, I need to workout anyways. \n\nFast forward an hour and I answer the doorbell slightly disoriented from my workout (insanity y'all!) and am greeted by the delivery guy. I pay, give him a 20% tip (my standard) and bring the food inside. I then realize that our order is looking a bit light. Open up all the containers and of course they forgot my burrito.\n\n I called their dispatch center right away informing him of the mistake. He tells me in a bored tone that he'd call the driver and get it fixed. Cool. Boyfriend eats, I nibble on chips and guac, and half an hour later still no food.\n\n I'm tired. I'm hungry. I just want my burrito. \n\nCall again, same bored guy. I get the issue escalated to a manager. The manager says the resturant forgot to make my order. I don't believe it for one bit and tell him that. He continues on in a bored tone and we hang up.\n\nLuckily the delivery boy shows up not to long after but really?!?!? You don't think to double check and order your picking up to go? You see the reciept and don't question a missing box? Then you have the gull to blame the resturant instead of saying hey our guy messed up but we'll make it right? \n\nAnd this is why I just get it myself now. Sorry for the length and thank you for just letting me rant on here. ",

        "text": "This happened a few months ago.\n\nSo I go up to the drop off window at the in-store pharmacy. There is a lady there working that I don't immediately recognize. I don't know if it was something about me that set her off, but her first words were a sharp \"And what do *you* want?\" I guess I was a little taken back by the tone, (which was very condescending for whatever reason) cause my brain farted and I stood silently for a little too long. \"*Hello!* What. Do. You. Want?\" \n\nI gave her her my name and the type of meds I was there to get. Maybe I should have said something to somebody, but I had never seen her before so just I just assumed she was having a rough time as a new person. I am not offended enough to bother.\n\nNow a month later I go to get meds, except with my daughter this time. She is getting around to preschool age. Anyways we go up to the drop off window and guess who is there? \"What do *you* want?\" Okay. This is just how you are then. Whatever. I rattle off my request, which is for birth control. She just kind of gives my daughter (who is admittingly jabbering about the ice cream she has been promised in return for a good trip to store a little above what the level I would like, but hey she totally thinks I will forget unless she keeps talking about it.) and I this judging glance and says \"Yeah that is probably a good idea.\"\n\nI started losing it right there. I didn't even mean to... I just couldn't help myself. Big ugly freaking crying.\n\nSome things that might need to be known for this story: I look younger than I am. Totally used to people seeing my daughter and I together and either assuming we are sisters or jumping to the judging *oh you had a baby way too young* thing. It happens. I am good humored about it when it does.\n\n...but recently my husband and I were trying for another, some issues occurred and we lost the baby. It was suggested that we do the birth control and give myself some time to recover physically and mentally. Its been rough on both of us.\n\nSo here I am on the sales floor doing my crying while this woman at least looks mortified. Management has to come over. I am not making a major scene (I mean I am upset, but I am not screaming or yelling) or anything but it is obvious that I just have been bawling my eyes out this whole time. \n\nManagement tried to be really nice, but honestly all I wanted to do was leave and hide. At this point my distress has caused my daughter to start crying. So now on top of emotional and embarrassed, I am getting worked up that I've upset her as well. I flee with the promise of sending the husband back for the stuff when it is filled.\n\nHusband went and came back with gift cards. Still haven't used them. I get that the manager felt awful and wanted to make up for it, but it wasn't the store's fault. Hell, even though the worker was rude I highly doubt she suspected she would set me off like that. \n\nI went back to going there for my medication today. The employee is no longer there. \n\n\n\n",

This Wednesday I received a call from a salesperson from Sternum Internet Provider. She said that they would refund me what I paid for shipping!!!!\n\n...all was good, until today. I finally received the fucking label on the mail. And can you guess what? The letter they sent with it has the date of February 13th, curiously enough the same day I posted a complaint with the FCC. It wasn't shipped until February 15th. I added this to the complaint and I stated that I further expect to be compensated for the business' shady practices and for all the time I wasted calling and e-mailing requesting a label since January 27th.\n\n[The envelope with the date](http://i.imgur.com/p4Rscuo.jpg)\n\n[The fucking letter they sent](http://i.imgur.com/NbPkpO3.jpg)\n\nAnd of course they even got that wrong.

Some customer was yelling at another employee and I swear the first thing I heard was something like, \"You have the personality of a (unclear).\" Unfortunately I didn't catch the last word, but the absurdity of that insult got my attention even further. \n\nSeveral employees started converging on the scene, or watching it from a distance in case things got uglier. One approached and tried to calm the guy down, but he kept yelling things about how he can read and the employee was just reading off the box of the fire extinguisher he wanted. He also claimed he was done with that store, but for some reason didn't leave. (I should note I worked in a small-town hardware store, and I know how it is - you're supposed to know everything about every product, but it's impractical due to available time and sheer variety. I've had to read labels in front of customers, too.) \n\nDuring a pause in yelling, the second employee asked the guy if there was something he could help with. Guy: \"No!\" Employee: \"Have a nice day.\" I believe the response was, \"Shove it up your ass!\"\n\nThey kind of escorted him to the front door - I don't think specifically asking him to leave, but making sure he didn't get lost or destructive, either. I heard more yelling when he was at the registers - which was a fair distance away at this point. \n\nI had to laugh at the absurdity of the situation. I told the cashier, who likely was right next to the second yelling, to have a nice day, in spite of people yelling.",

        "text": "This is a story of the most insane customer service experience of my life, and a good guy named #8 who made it a little better. (there have been multiple updates since the original debacle, they're at the bottom of the story)\n\nI got a flyer in the mail from a new internet service provider saying that they bought my current provider and now I was a new customer with them and I could call in for special promotions. After a few attempts over the course of a month and them telling me they weren’t actually in my area yet and to try back later, I was able to talk to a representative yesterday who was very helpful (or so I thought...). \n\nMy current internet speed was/is 30Mbps download. The nice lady on the phone (rep #1) said that for 40 cents cheaper a month, they’d actually upgrade me to 60Mbps as that was their base speed. Sounds great! I ask if my current modem/router combo I was renting from the old company will work or if I need to change the equipment out. She looks up the model listed on my account info and says it’s already good to go and that the new provider does not charge rental fees so that was what brought the price down. Even better! I asked her when it would be in effect and she told me she was pushing the button as we spoke and it would be good to go right away since we had the right equipment in place already.\n\nThis all happened around 11AM and I wasn’t at home at the time, just on a break at work and thought I’d just call out of curiosity.\n\nFast forward to 4:30PM when I got home, I checked speeds, excited for my new, faster internet speed but it’s the same as before, but I decided to give it the whole evening. Again, I check it around 10:30PM and I’m pulling around 30Mbps. I wasn’t tired so I decided to hop on the provider's website and there is an option to chat with a rep online which I thought would be nice and easy while I was streaming TV (using my 30Mbps internet speed).\n\nI spoke with a gentleman (rep #2), explained the issue, and he quickly told me that the issue was related to the change not being finished on the account and he would close it and it would take effect within minutes, the first lady must have forgot to close it out. After a few minutes, he said he couldn't close it for some reason but gave me a number to call to finish the process explaining they would be able to do it immediately but couldn’t explain why he couldn’t do it himself.\n\nI called in to the number that rep #2 gave me, and another lady (rep #3) couldn't fix it because rep #2 from the online chat was blocking her access by still being logged into my account. She places me on hold for about 15 minutes and finally returns and explains that they two of them kept booting each other out of my account trying to fix the problem but they finally figured that out and now she (rep #3) was going to finish the process so I could enjoy my new internet. She told me she would put me on hold for just a few minutes and come back to tell me when it was finished. \"Finally, that took longer than it should have” I though to myself, oh stupid me…\n\nAbout 10 minutes later, some random guy (rep #4) answers the phone and asks what he can do to assist me. I explain what just happened with reps 2 and 3 and explained that #3 told me she’d be right back. He had no knowledge of anything and asked me what cable provider I had (um what?). Annoyed, I told him. He asked for my account number (as they all had done), then asked for my home address, then my name. He read it all back to me, number for number, letter for letter, and said he had the account number up, it matched the address, but had a completely different name on the account and he would not be able to help me. I explained to him that 3 other people were able to find my account before him, I was looking at my account online and my name was on there, spelled correctly. He apologized and told me that there was nothing he could do and I’d have to call back later. After kindly telling him that the problem was with him, not with my account, I hung up.\n\nI call back in and the guy who I get sent to (rep #5) finds my account no issue and says he already knows the problem before I even explain my journey up to this point. He says my modem is not compatible with the new service and he doesn't know why the first girl (rep #1) told me it was. He tells me I either need to come into the local office to get a new modem/router combo or have it shipped which will take 8 days. I tell him I will pick it up and he says he made a note on my account so the people at the local office will know what I need. Finally, even though I’m annoyed, I at least know how to fix the problem. But oh wait… I tell him before we get off the phone that I wanted to verify with him the speeds I would be getting once I got the new modem because I felt like the girl who upgraded me (rep #1) must not have known what she was doing since she told me my current equipment was fine. He looked it up and said I was upgraded to 30 down and 5 up (which was my original speed anyways!) and that as soon as I hooked up the new modem/router I would be enjoying the new speed of 30Mbps. I tell him that rep #1 changed me to 60 Mbps and she had told me that was the standard now. Rep #5 is very confused by this and puts me on hold for a long time (15-20 minutes). He finally comes back and says he thinks rep #1 hit the wrong promotion code but he doesn't have the right authority to fix the issue. Next, he tells me he has to transfer me to someone else who can actually fix the problem and wants to know if I have any other issues before transferring me. I told him no but I really hoped he was sending me to someone who knew what was going on and could fix it since I had talked to numerous people so far and was no closer to a solution.\n\nI get put on hold for about 10 more minutes and then just end back at the main call table where I have to punch my info in, select my issue etc and get back into queue. Just as a note, I selected the option that says I was calling back in regarding a previous conversation/problem.\n\nWhen the next guy answers (rep #6) they asked what the issue was. Here we go again… I explained everything that has happened, he said it was the wrong department and he would try to forward me to the right people and to stay on the line since he was tech support and not sales.\n\nSo #6 tries to forward me and can't reach whoever he was looking for, probably because it’s 12:45AM. I mean, I’m already so far down the rabbit hole at this point I can’t bring myself to call it a night due to the fact that I don’t want to do it all over again from the beginning later. SO #6 says he's sending me to the customer service line and he would make note of everything so I wouldn't have to tell the WHOLE story for the umpteenth time.\n\nI get to the next guy #7 and almost immediately he knows what the problem is. THEY DON'T OFFER THAT SPEED IN MY AREA ANYWAYS! He says I don't need new equipment and apologizes for the inconvenience. I told him that while I appreciate him finding the issue, I was through the roof and pissed off that I spoke to six other people, spent 30 minutes online chatting and hours on the phone to find out that I was ending the night with absolutely nothing. I asked him to please send me to whoever had the power to make me not boot their company to the curb ASAP and hate them for all eternity. He told me he would transfer me right away and to hold on but wanted me to know that nothing was guaranteed when I spoke with the next person (and he told me God bless, thanks bud…).\n\nThat's when #8 got on the phone. I like this guy. #8 listened to the whole debacle, got pissed off as well, laughed with me and the insanity of the night, busted out laughing when he saw the help log for the night of everyone who talked to me, said he'd never seen someone run around like that. I told him to make me happy before I told his company to go to hell as they deserved. He offered me a $20 credit on my next bill (the max he could do according to him). I told him I'd take it but if they thought my time with was worth less than $10 an hour to talk to incompetent morons, it wasn't going to make me hate his company any less. I also told him that if I could find anyone else in the area who provided internet at all then they would get kicked to the curb and he said he'd do the same, good old #8. Again, he told me it was the max he could do. We laughed for a bit more, shot the breeze then he told me to go have a cold beer for him and asked me to please try to enjoy the night even though his company was awful. I'm now drinking my cold beer as of typing this. This one's for you #8.\n\nFinal total for the night, 8 internet provider reps, 2.5 hours of talking, to be upgraded, told my equipment was fine, told my equipment was not fine, then be told my upgrade was actually impossible.\n\nHere’s to you #8, you da real MVP! \n\nNew internet provider, burn in internet provider hell.\n\n#UPDATE #1: I just got an email from FedEx saying the ISP from above shipped out my new modem and it will arrive tomorrow. This is AFTER they said I would pick it up at the local shop (not even ship it) and then that I didn't even need it because they couldn't upgrade my internet. WHAT IS HAPPENING?\n\n#UPDATE #2: I called today for multiple reasons, those being that my internet had just gone out, I wanted to see why I'm getting a modem from FedEx, and to see about getting my bill cheaper since I'm getting lower speeds. The first lady, we will call her #9, said the other 8 reps were wrong, my area does have 60 Mbps speed, it just started, she would send me over to someone to finish the process. I told her I had zero confidence in her but sure, why not.\n\n#10 picks up, a nice guy, I explain everything, he tells me to wait while he checks it out. Come back a few minutes later and tells me #9 is crazy and 30Mbps is all I can have for the time being. I told him I figured as much. With that settled (again), what's with the new modem? 10 tells me that he has no idea but to just keep it and hook it up so if higher speeds ever come out I'm already set to go I told him OK. I ask him about dropping my bill since I have lower speeds, he looks into it and the normal price (not promotion price) is already $20 lower then what I'm paying, they just hadn't lowered my bill because I didn't mention it yet.... That's annoying but at least my bill is lower now moving forward. I next ask him if he can find out why my internet went out right before I called. He told me he's need to send me to a tech, and he did. #11 gets on the phone and I explain my internet is out. The modem is lit up (I had already tried rebooting it) and I was actually getting wifi signal, just not internet. He digs around and find out that since they shipped me a modem the day before (that I didn't ask for or want), the new company already moved my service to the new modem and turned off the internet access through the old modem. I asked him to place change it back and he said it was permanent (not sure how that's possible) and I could either go pick up a modem locally until the new one arrived or I'd just have to wait. I told him I'd wait (I'm pretty sure it will arrive today according to tracking info). Not to be screwed entirely again, I told him I wanted money taken off the bill due to their screw ups and me not having internet. He knocked another $20 off this months bill, I'll take it.",

        "text": "This happened about eight years ago. My parents moved to Dubai (we’re Australian) and a couple of months later I went over to visit them during my uni break. Mum was still putting the apartment together and hadn’t fully furnished “my” bedroom/bathroom yet. \n\nOnce I’d recovered from my flight she suggested we go to a local bargain shop that she’d found, the “Six Dirham Store”, to pick up some basic toiletries and other supplies. Before arriving she warned me that a lot of the products didn’t have prices on them, so she had to constantly ask the floor staff. Mum is a bit of scrooge and will always shop around for the best deal on even the simplest items, so knowing the price is a big deal to her.\n\nOn arrival we were greeted by a middle-aged male employee who clearly recognised mum. We split up and I had a browse. It didn’t take long to realise that the gimmick of the store was that every price was a multiple of six. I also noticed, as per the warning, that a lot of the products were unlabelled - but they were the smaller, knick-knack type things. I quickly developed the suspicion that the unlabelled items cost six dirhams each.\n\nI walked to the next aisle and saw mum with a basket full of kitchen/cleaning supplies, showing all of them to the man who had greeted us. \n\n&gt; “How much for this?”\n\n&gt; “That one is six dirhams, ma’am.”\n\n&gt; “Oh, okay. And how much for this?”\n\n&gt; “That one is six dirhams, ma’am.”\n\n&gt; “Okay. And how much…\"\n\nThis continued. It was actually quite cute, because they were both so polite and patient. It was like watching two little kids naming toys together.\n\nI eventually stepped in to tell her my theory about the prices, which the employee confirmed, and we all had a bit of a laugh about it. She later told me that she had been to the store about once a fortnight for the past three months and that same employee had helped her each time, and calmly priced every single six dirham item for her. I can’t begin to fathom the patience that man had.",

        "text": "It's unfortunate, but there are a few times I've had not great service at a certain high street department store (in several locations), but one experience really sticks out for me.\n\nI was looking for gifts for my sister's birthday on this particular occasion, and I didn't really have anything in mind, just browsing. I went to the women's clothing floor and saw an absolutely beautiful dress that I thought she might like, and as I approached the rack I noticed two staff members gossiping, which I didn't really think much of. If everything's in order, there's nothing wrong with chatting.\n\nNow, I know I'm fat. Just a fact, and I'm working to change it. My sister, however, is decidedly not, and I couldn't see her (very commonly found) size on the rack.\n\nSo naturally, I turned to the staff and this exchange occurred (ME is obviously me, CS is C(h)atty Staff):\n\n&gt;Me: Excuse me?  \n&gt;CS: **Both turn to look at me, unimpressed**  \n&gt;Me: Do you have this dress in any other sizes?  \n&gt;CS: **They both give me a long look up and down before either of them responds**  \n&gt;CS1: We don't have *your size* here.  \n&gt;Me: **kind of shocked at her bluntness** Uh... I'm looking for (sister's size).  \n&gt;CS1: Uh-huh. You definitely won't find anything here.  \n&gt;Me: Uh... okay... thanks?  \n&gt;CS2: Mhm, no problem. **gives me one of the most false smiles I've ever seen**  \n&gt;CS: **Both go back to gossiping and giggling and I just walk away feeling pretty bewildered**\n\nI mean, I know usually people go clothes shopping for themselves but in my opinion it was pretty tactless the way they dealt with me. I never did complain but I kind of wish I had. I have slight anxiety approaching staff in the first place, too, so... yeah. Now I just kind of avoid that part of the store. Since, y'know... *I definitely won't find anything there*.\n\nEdit: fixed formatting",

        "text": "A lot of technical IT/cable jargon and I apologize if i lose you reading this.  \n\n2 weeks ago we had new TV/Internet put in, it was a better deal for us and they hooked us by saying the 1st month was a test run and we could cancel before the 1st payment is due and wont have to pay anything. \n\nWhen they came to install their equipment, they were unable to  get the lines to the left side of the house (so our office wouldn't have wired internet) Me and my husband are both tech savvy people and said we'd just run a line across the house from the master bedroom to the office and be done with it. The technician was chatty and found out he doesn't have TV or Internet at home. \n\nLast week we started having TV issues and had a technician come out within 24 hours, he arrived this morning.  The main TV couldn't get setup or have a signal, we were on our 2nd main box in 2 weeks, and our other 2 wireless boxes were able to get TV. \n\nT for technician and M for me obviously: \n\nT: Sees Ethernet cable running along the house  \"you either had someone run the wire or you did it yourself, so this issue is your fault\" \"This wasn't here when I installed this\" \n\nM: \"We installed this the day you left, we started having issues this past friday after you guys buried the lines\" \n\nT: \"This is new! What is this?\" as he points to a router switch. \"this has to be the issue\" \n\nT: \"You changed the internet ID and password, so you did changes to our modem!\" \n\nM: \"We only changed the ID and password\" \n\nAfter 2 hours of him switching out our main TV box and their company modem, he still doesn't know what is wrong with our TV.  He has to call his office and get a 2nd opinion and whoever was on the end of the phone word for word said \"they changed settings on the modem and attempted to put it back to original settings\" \n\nT: \"You changed the settings and that caused the issues\" \nM: \"We only changed the ID and password\" \"we didn't change anything else\" \n\nAt this point I'm tired of being accused of doing things that I clearly did not do. \n\nHe later threatened that next time if we make any more changes (including the ID and password) that he will charge me $200-$300 to come out and fix it.  \n\nThe issue got fixed and after he left I called technical support to find out exactly what happened. I found out that the error message from the main box could have been from a few different things and the guy confirmed changing information like the ID and password wouldn't have caused the issues we were having. \n\nRight now im 100% ready to cancel this contract and be done with it, don't accuse me of making changes that i don't know how to change and certainly don't make me feel threatened in my own home! \n\n\n\nEdit for more info: \nSince we are on a trial period for a month and my husband being a lazy goof, we still have our old cable provider hooked up and it's paid for until the end of the month. \n\nWe are 100% sure dropping this new company. But I am curious to see how this plays out since I did file a complaint about the guy and it's been sent to the supervisor over the technicians. \n\n\n",

So this guy starts the preparation off and I move down the line. \n\nEventually when my order is handed off to the woman I realise its not the right order.

        "text": "So as the title suggests, this story has been developing over the last year. I switched phone companies over a year ago. Before I switched, I inquired about their international plans, since I knew I would be abroad next year (currently). The man answered that as long as I had the phone for a year I would qualify for the international services. He then went into a long explanation about it ending with \"if there's any problems just call us.\"\n\nGreat. So it looked like everything would be perfect. Fast forward to earlier January. I stop back into the store to switch my plan. Note this is of course a different salesman. \n\nI tell him where I'm going and what the last guy told me. He seems a bit confused but goes about setting up the plan. Then he starts reading off what I'm actually getting with the international plan. The one and only international plan allows for international texting, data, and calling. I also had to put my family members on the plan for them to be able to reach me. This was a bit of a lengthy and challenging process. He ends our conversation with \"you may want to call before you leave and make sure everything is right.\" \n\nI left the store not feeling very confident. The guy didn't seem very certain in what he was doing. So I call later that week. I get a woman this time, who after I explain my story says, \"We don't offer international service.\"\nWhen I asked about the plan I purchased she told me, \"That's for Mexico and Canada only. And only for calling them, not calling from there.\"\n\nPretty much, everything I had been told over the last year was wrong. She went back and reset all our plans. Now I'm in Europe relying on wifi for everything. ",

I will definitely report them to FCC as /u/Jameschoral suggested regardless of the outcome.\n\nI called them again today and I asked to speak to a manager or a supervisor. The lady on the phone first tried to insist that she could help me but I did not budge. \n\nAs soon as I got the supervisor on the phone, I explained to her the whole tirade, the calls I have made, I explained to her how we didn't want nor need the damn modem and that I was done calling. She was understanding and more open to give me a solution.\n\nI asked her for a damn address to send the modem to on my own dime and SHE GAVE ME THE ADDRESS. After that I told her how all representatives refused to give me an address and she told me \"Oh, we avoid doing that but since you've been dealing with this so long...\" No shit, sherlock.\n\nSo she gave me an address, instructions to attach my information (account number, name, address, account phone number, etc) to the box of the modem and to make sure to insure it and request proof of delivery through a signature. \n\nI will go ahead and do that and on Wednesday I will write a nice complaint to the FCC regardless. There was no need for me to call them and e-mail them so many times and there was no reason whatsoever for that damn label to not be sent to me or my correct address, and most importantly there is no reason as to why I should have to pay for it, but here we are. They can suck it. \n\n------------------------------------\n\n**Edit:** I just went ahead and paid for a shipping label (plus the added services of signature delivery and insurance.) I received a call from Equipment Recovery Services, so I explained to them the situation, gave them the tracking number, called the internet provider and gave them the tracking number as well.\n\nReceived a: \"I'm glad you have the initiative to send the modem back! We did all we could on our end\" from the representative and immediately afterwards I filed a complaint with the FCC along with ticket # (from each call I made), screenshots of the e-mails I sent and a thorough description on what happened :) \n",

He hands over a coupon for the product that says $X off any Zyrtec product.  The \"D\" here is important - this means it's a regulated product due to some of the medicine in it, and thus coupons won't always work on it.

        "text": "Currently my bf is staying with me. He's travelled overseas to come here, and his family wired him money through a popular international money transfer. This happened to my bf earlier today and we're still fuming. Me so more than him. BF- boyfriend, CL- Clerk. \n\nWe got to the convenience store and he said he had money sent through, cited the code he had for it, and CL began the verification. \n\nShe asked for ID and proof of residency, which is a bit odd because this company doesn't require residency. He had with him files which matched his passport, such as a rental car contract and customs forms. \n\nCL- \"This is not enough ID, you need address.\" \n\nBF- \"I don't live here, but I have my passport.\"\n\nCL- \"You need address, this not enough ID.\"\n\nWe both thought wtf, a passport is a very legitimate form of ID that isn't easy to forge. On the website it states what you need for ID, and proof of address isn't one of them.\n\nBF- \"I have my license, and a rental car agreement?\" \n\nHe's a bit agitated because today is steaming hot and everything seems to be going wrong anyway, so it doesn't help that this lady whom has poor English (I'm stating this because there may have been a language barrier further inhibiting the process) won't accept his passport. He managed to stay polite, which tbqh I probably wouldn't have managed. She had a very disaproving disposition??\n\nShe proceeds to get out the requirements form, which states in plain English *ONE of these forms of ID is required for validation*. Nothing about address.\n\nBF points to the passport option, and then to his passport. \n\nBF- \"I have the necessary ID.\"\n\nCL shakes her head and says she at least needs his passport. \n\nWtf???\n\nThey go back and forth for a few minutes before BF gives up and leaves, but as we're doing so, she says they didn't have enough cash to fill the transfer anyway. \n\nDo we have a right to be irritated about this? He had all the necessary forms and ID, the code, and could give the details of the sender. There wasn't anything wrong other than the lady not *letting* him get the money out. It seems like she was trying to be difficult because she didn't have the money in total, but it seems logical that this big name company would require stores or outlets have publicly stated limits on the cash they can dispense. I'm probably going to lay a complaint with the company HQ's tomorrow. Eventually we had his family withdraw the money and said it to a different store across town, where the process when smoothly as possible. ",

        "text": "So hey there redditors, get ready for a ride. It may get a bit long, but I believe it’s worth the read. This story starts a month ago. January 12th. I go to a store, and for the sake of the story, we’ll call it Xara. So, I know this store has a HORRIBLE reputation in all aspects. Poor customer service, cheap products, scamming. I’ve heard it all. Despite this, I know several people from work who have some really cute things from there so I thought, why not give it a shot regardless?\n \nThey have this huge sale where the entire store is a minimum 50% off. I look through their stuff online and see that the store nearest my current class has a pair of jeans for $20 and a jacket for $60 that I’m interested in. Great. I have an hour between classes and it just so happens to be on the way to the place I usually grab a coffee, so it’s super convenient. Anyways, I go in, grab the things, pay, and leave. The whole thing is maybe 15 minutes and I have no issues finding what I want. It was pretty busy since it was the lunch hour rush so I just got my receipt and went on my merry way.\n\nI try the items on at home and decide that although they’re both great, they’re definitely not made with my body type in mind. They look great online, but those models at stick thin and 6 feet tall, whereas despite being borderline underweight, I still carry enough weight on my thighs to have a curve and struggle to hit that 5’4” mark. Not the fit I hoped for.\nKeep in mind, I never throw away any receipt. I have receipts for every returnable thing I’ve ever purchased. I have receipts from years ago, so naturally I have my receipt for this purchase too. Anyways, about a week later, let’s say the 20th or 21st, I have another lunch break, but this time, I’m closer to a different, much larger location. I see this as the perfect opportunity to return the items.\n\n Let’s skip the part where the whole store was literally on the floor and disgusting. I get to the register and there’s a line of 25+ people. How many cashiers? 2. How many registers? 8. Why the other employees stood around twiddling their thumbs and passing by, I do not know. \nFast forward the almost half hour I stood in line, I’m finally getting served. I go up, hand over my stuff, and say I want a refund. The girl takes my card, checks everything, returns the $20 pants, and here’s where the problems begin. (M = me, C = cashier).\n\nC: Sorry, I can’t return the jacket\n\nM: Why not?\n\nC: It’s not on the receipt.\n\nM: What? That’s impossible. This is literally the only purchase I have ever made at this store. There’s no other receipt it could possibly be on.\n\nC: Well, no. The pants are on here, and I returned them, but other than that, it says you bought a skirt for $80\nAt this point, I take the receipt back and I’m like wtf? And she’s right. There on the receipt, it says “skirt” with a hefty price next to it. I look at her.\n\nM: Listen, never in my right mind would I buy a skirt for $80. The cashier must have made a mistake.\nThe cashier proceeds to call the manager and the manager tells me that if the cashier did mess up, then I have to go to the original store of purchase for them to check the cameras. I work retail (This will be important later), so I think, ok, fair enough, but this is still a major inconvenience on my part. \n\nNot only have I just essentially wasted half an hour to not get a refund because of some cashier’s mistake, I now had to spend the remaining half trying to fix it instead of eating lunch. With wasted time and an empty belly, I was pretty upset. I go back to the original store and ask to speak to a manager. The fitting room attendant seems surprised by the request and clumsily directs me to a woman. And wow, was this woman a character.\n\nI explain the whole situation to her, how I bought it, the cashier must have misscanned it, etc. The whole time, she’s looking at me with this disgusted face, one eyebrow raised skeptically. When I mention the cashier misscanning the item, she cuts me off, and the first thing she’s said to me since I’ve begun talking to her is (and imagine this in the most condescending, ‘you’re an idiot’, judgemental voice possible) (and this is literally word for word what she said) “You’re telling me you didn’t make sure the cashier did her job correctly?”\n\nI was flabbergasted. Um, no, I didn’t. That’s not MY job. It’s YOURS. I’m sorry for trusting a girl scan a tag attached to a jacket I handed her. Where she even got an $80 skirt from, I can’t tell you.\nI explain that I was in a rush between classes, and the amount I ended up paying, despite being overcharged $30, is roughly what I expected, since I was buying high quality embroidered jeans and a fleece lined, embroidered and painted denim jacket, especially with our taxes being as high as they are. I didn’t expect the cashier to mess up.\n\nIn response, I get a few eye rolls, monotone “uh-huhs”, and sighs. At this point, I’m even more upset with the attitude I’m being given for a mistake that was not my own. I show her my receipt, and I tell her that the manager at the other store said to check the cameras, so I’m going to need her to do that because I need my money back for the coat, especially since bill payments were coming up, and being a uni student always makes those an extra bit of fun.\nWhen I mention cameras, she cuts me of and says “Uh, NO. I’m NOT going to check the cameras because it takes a minimum of THREE days. Oh, and since we’re closing soon, that three days starts TOMORROW.”\n\nNow, like I mentioned, it was lunch. They were not closing soon. Second of all, their company uses the same systems my store does as I’m pretty sure they’re the largest in North America. I had my receipt which had the time AND date, and as I mentioned earlier, I work retail and I have looked up receipts for customers several times before. The purchase was only a week ago. It wasn’t months back, it was a few days, plus she had the time of the purchase, register, cashier, everything and more with the other info on the receipt, PLUS all she had to do was select the time and date! The computer does the rest! She literally had the simplest part. Press some keys on a keyboard.\n\nI tell her all of this and she says, “No it takes three days minimum. We have to conference call head office before doing anything and we have to mail them paperwork for the case.” Wtf? No. This is not true. People who used to work here confirmed for me at a later date that this is not true. So, she then sighs and rolls her eyes ONCE AGAIN when she sees I’m not any closed to giving up and she snatched my receipt saying “I GUESS I’ll take down your info.” And then in a split second her mood seems to get better when she cheerfully says “Oh! I can’t help you! You bought this on the first of December, do your receipt is expired. SORRY!”\n\nAnd I’m here like, wtf, you work here and you don’t know how to read the format of your own receipts? I ask her, “So I bought this on the first of December, 2017?” Realizing her failed attempt at brushing me off, she goes back to grumpy and takes down my info. Never once says sorry for the mistake by her cashier, wasting my time running between stores, nothing.\n\nAfter such a horrible experience, I contact their customer service and write them a lengthy email about how atrocious my treatment was in a situation where I was not in the wrong, was completely cooperating, and had all proof and documents on hand. Their reply was something along the lines of “omg, we’re so sorry, please send us pictures of your receipt and your contact info for us to begin investigating.”\n\nNow a week goes by since that “48” hour mark, and I have not hear from that manager.\nTHREE WEEKS go by and I have not heard anything from Customer service. I periodically message them for updates and they keep saying “We’re still investigating.”\n\nFINALLY, on Tuesday, the 7th of FEBRUARY, almost a month after my purchase, I get a call. Now, the call couldn’t have been at a worst time. I was stuck commuting in the middle of freezing rain storm. Tracks have frozen over, so the trains aren’t working. Shuttle buses take forty minutes to arrive and I have to pass on 3 of them because there are way too many people. A 30 minute commute becomes a 2 hour commute, my hands are cold to the point where my phone doesn’t recognize my fingers, and the umbrella of the woman beside me freezes over in front of my eyes so that when she closes it later, the ice mold of her umbrella shatters over her head.\nI get a call.\n\nM=me, CS=customer service(if you can call it that)\n\nM: Hello?\n\nCS: Hello. Can we speak to OP?\n\nM: That’s me.\n\nCS: Hi, we’re calling from Xara about a social media post about not being able to return an item?\nAt this point, I’m like thank god, at least something good will come out of this horrible day\n\nM: Yeah?\n\nCS: Yeah, we’re not going to refund you.\n\nM:....what do you mean?\n\nCS: We checked your receipt against our inventory and there are no discrepancies.\n\nM: Well obviously not. Your inventory is going to say that because my receipt shows a skirt was sold. That’s the issue.\n\nCS: Yeah, well there’s no problem with it so we’re not going to refund you.\n\nM: At this point, this is becoming such a hassle that I’ll just keep the jacket. You can’t even refund me the $20 I was overcharged?\n\nCS: No because you paid $80 for that skirt so there’s nothing to refund.\n\nM: Okay, so if I bought this skirt, I would like for you forward me the camera footage of me paying for the skirt. The time and date is on the receipt. \n\nCS: Oh, no, we don’t check cameras.\n\nWtf? They don’t check the only place that has the evidence?\n\nM: What do you MEAN you don’t check cameras?\n\nCS: That’s only for the company heads.\n\nM: That’s not true. There are many situations in which a store would need camera footage to be accessible.\n\nCS: We do not check cameras.\n\nM: So then why did two different managers at two separate locations mention that cameras would be checked?\n\nCS: Well, they lied to you. Is there anything else I can help you with?\n\nNow as I mentioned, he caught me at a horrible time. I was freezing, already in a shitty mood, and really not up for arguing when I was barely holding my phone so I said no and hung up.\nBut mind you, I was FURIOUS. \n\nI’ve been doing the best I can, have been as cooperative as possible, and this is how I’m being treated? I was almost 4 weeks into dealing with this which meant my receipt would expire soon, and if I’ve been getting so much resistance for doing everything right, god forbid they have a legit reason to turn me away.\n\nSo with two days left, and a eight of my hard earned dollars at stake, I decide for one more, final, dramatic push. At this point, I don’t care if it gets me banned because I know I’ll never be shopping there again. \nThe next day, I grab my stuff, and rile myself up the entire day. I piece together my plan, from the moment I step in to when the credits role.\n\nI was up to the register and ask for the manager. The cashier asks me why and I explain the situation to her. She waves and mumbles something in a general direction towards two people. One of them is the same manager who I spoke to last time and I prayed for someone else, anyone else because I knew she would tell to fuck off before hearing me out a second time. Luckily, the other person, a man, turns .5 seconds faster and ends up being the one who comes over. The cashier briefly explains what I told her to him and then he turns to me. Here I go, I think to myself. One last attempt.\n\nAnd I start BALLING. SOBBING, full out rivers on my cheeks. Now this manager is faced with a short, petite girl crying in front of him. He tries to calm me down and promises he’ll figure this out for me. He takes my receipt and what does he do? He runs to CHECK THE CAMERAS!!!!! SOMETHING THAT COULD HAVE BEEN DONE WEEKS AGO!!! WITHIN TEN MINUTES, I HAVE MY $80 BACK AND A SINCERE APOLOGY FROM THE TWO DUDES WHO HANDLED THE SITUATION AS QUICKLY AND SWIFTLY AS POSSIBLE WHILE THAT ASSHOLE MANAGER FROM BEFORE STOODBY AND WATCHED IT ALL UNFOLD. I WAS TURNED AWAY THREE TIMES OVER THE COURSE OF A MONTH FOR SOMETHING THAT COULD HAVE BEEN DONE IN 10 MINUTES!!!!!\n\nOnce I left the store, and wiped the fake tears, real ones started coming, like all that pent up frustration was coming out all at once. To some people, $80 may not be a lot. But to a broke university student who has a dog who needs $80 monthly shots to be able to walk, it means the world. I just can’t believe that I had to argue with three different people and be led on and blatantly mistreated over the course of an entire month for a mistake that was 100% theirs, where I cooperated 100% and even went extra miles to get them anything they needed to resolve the matter. \n\nThe fact that I had to fake a mental breakdown after a month of struggle to get back $80 dollars that I was literally scammed out of is unbelievable. And had I gotten that same manager a second time, I would not have it to this day. Thank you to those two guys who helped me. Fuck the actual company and their devotion to hire the most incompetent of people for all positions.\nNeedless to say, I will never even consider going into Xara again.\nThis was one hell of a first, and last impression.\nBuyer's beware.\n\nEdit: formatting. Sorry I've never posted a story/long post on here before and when i typed it up on my computer, it was evenly spaced into smaller paragraphs. \n\nAlso, yes I am on the tight budget, but it was near Christmas time, so I had a little extra cash that I could invest into higher quality clothing that would last me a while and I've been eyeing that jacket for half a year. Besides, my form of stress relief is shopping. When in stressed out, I'll spend some money, and then when I calm down the next day I go return it. It's just how I am, sorry if that's being a bad person lol. ",

        "text": "Obligatory: this one happened a couple months ago, during holiday season, on mobile, maybe some formatting errors. Sorry dudes\n\nI was at a popular bra store the other day, looking for a new, cute matching set. I look around for a while, pick what I want, with the help of an associate, and go in the dressing room. I try a few bras on, and find one I really, really, really like it. The only problem is that the bra is a little too small, so I put on the littler shirt they hang in there, and press the button for assistance. I hand the bra to the associate, and ask if I can have the same one in a slightly larger size. The problem though, is I'm kind of shaped weird, which results being a weird bra size. \n\nThe girl brings back the new bra, in the right size. I try it on, but realize that it's not the same bra. It's a different one from the same line. It has a couple small, aesthetic differences, and one big functional difference. It's a pushup bra, and I hate pushup bras. They're never comfortable and you always start to fall out of them as soon as your leave the house or get halfway into your shift. But I digress. \n\nSo I pick up my things, and leave the fitting room. I return the unwanted bras to the fitting room attendant. I look around, and try to find the bra that I really liked, to see if they had it in my size. Unfortunately, I couldn't find it. I found some similar ones, but not quite the same. At some point, an associate comes by, and asks if I'm doing okay. I tell her my story. I tell her that I just really really want the bra I had. I describe it to her, and she takes me to the pushup bras. I tell her that this one is similar to the one I liked, but the one I liked wasn't a pushup bra. I then describe it to her. Then she takes me to another table, with a completely different style. I tell her this is not the bra I had. She told me that yes, this was in fact the bra I had. But I'm positive I didn't go in the fitting room with a see through bra with so support. So I ask if I can just speak to the girl that was helping me before, because she would know. But unfortunately she was on break. \n\nI pulled up a picture of the bra I wanted, because words had failed me. So I show her the picture, from their own website. She then points back down at the bra she brought me to and says \"Yeah. This one.\" Very rudely. So I pick up the tag, and read it. Then read the name of the one I wanted. They weren't even from the same line of bras. She huffed a little, and I tell her, whatever dude, I'll help myself. But I still couldn't find the bra I had, there were no more in the display where I had gotten it. So I just settled for the on that didn't fit, and spent 60 dollars that I regret to this day. \n\nTL;DR: Tried on a bra. They take it to bring me a new size, bring the wrong item, and then can't find the one I had. I settle for the one they brought me and wasted 60 bucks on a bra that doesn't fit me right. Regret it every day. \n\nEDIT: sorry for the length guys :c",

        "text": "So a few months ago my grandma had decided to get a tablet PC and for this reason needed internet in her flat. She took this opportunity to change her phone provider altogether, because the one she was with is needlessly expensive and has some truly evil-corporate-level customer service (as we were going to experience first hand). Germans probably know which one I'm talking about ;). So she called them to cancel her contract. After the typical renegotiation attempts, they told they'd send her a confirmation form to sign. So she waited for it to arrive, but nothing happened. She called again, they apologized and said they'd send it again. She sent them a written cancellation notice, which they claimed never arrived. \n\nAfter about 6 weeks, my brother got really pissed and called them, and then learnt that all these confirmation forms had been sent to her email account. My grandma did not have an email account at that time, she didn't even have internet in her flat yet, which they very well knew, and she certainly never had given them any such address. Never once before during their phone conversations had they alluded to the email thing, even though my grandma said that it should have been clear through her wording that she thought it would come via snail mail. When asked what my grandmother's supposed e-mail-adresse was, they gave us a gmail-address with her name. I can only repeat, my grandmother never told them she had an email adresse and the one they told us didn't even exist. \n\nWell, end of story, my brother threw a huge fit over the phone (which is apparently something you have to do to get what you want with these folks), they sent the confirmation form and 3 months later she could switch her provider. \n\nEDIT: spelling",

I was waiting for my order to go, when this older lady storms up to the counter with a sundae in hand. \n\nL: \"I asked for a chocolate sundae, not a vanilla one with chocolate sauce.\" \n\nE: I'm sorry but that's how they're made here\"\n\nL: I want my sundae to be like one of those! *points to the sign with a blizzard* \n\nE: Well we can make you one, but it'll cost a dollar more and we'll need the sundae back. \n\nL: I'm not paying anymore money and here's your sundae! *throws it at employee*\n\nThe Sundae missed and the employee was alright, but ladyzilla didn't look she was done. A couple customers got up and probably they were either going to check on the employee, restrain the lady or call the police. \n\nTwo teenage boys come around to the counter one grab the lady and the other goes and apologizes for their mom's behavior. The apologizing one leaves some money for them, while other pulls mom out the door. I hear from one of the boys. \"This is why dad divorced you.\" \n\nAfter they left the customers including myself went over and asked if the employee she said \"Yes, I'm fine just a little shaken. Never experience a customer like that yet.\" She went in the back and I then grabbed my order and head out. Hopping she'll be okay. ",

I needed the service until my day of moving so I did not have a chance to give the modem back to the store directly, hence why I asked for a shipping label before cancelling.

So to the game store I went, and lucky enough they had one copy of a game I had been dying to get in stock! Guy rings it up, then pauses and looks at me and asks if I have an adult with me, as he couldn't sell it to me otherwise. \n\nPlease note that I am 21. I don't do a lot of shopping myself (due to crippling anxiety that I'm working on) and the purchase was kind of spur-of-the-moment, so I didn't think to bring my ID. Thankfully my Mom and brother were out with me, so I had to call my Mom over to explain that I am indeed an adult - my exact words were 'Mom I need you to help me get this game because I look like a kid!' (also please note I said this in good humour) \n\nThe cashier let out an 'oh, this is awkward' but he took it good-naturedly, and I assured him it's all good, as I found it rather funny myself; I also apologized for not bringing my ID with me. The other cashier told me that looking super young is something I'll really appreciate the older I get. I got the game and I've been loving it since.\n\nI've been to that game store a few more times since (once including a funny moment where I explained to another employee there that Story of Seasons is the new Harvest Moon name and another responded by saying I could teach him about it) and all the folks working there have been so lovely. They definitely taught me to remember to bring my ID wherever I go. :b \n",

I felt the tug off my ears as if someone yanked those off me. I did try to see who the fuck was it, but it's already pretty dark and way too crowded. Damn it, someone's lucky day.\n\nSo here I am, on the Railway Station, my nice headphones gone, stolen. And I badly need some now. I just don't think much. Annoyed, I started walking towards my home. Then I remembered a nice shop just a few steps off my current path. I rush there hoping to finding it open for business. They were almost closing the shop.\n\n&gt; $Trainee : Sir, we're closing the shop now.\n\n&gt; $Me : I need headphones...\n\n&gt; $Trainee : Sorry ?\n\n&gt; $Me : Headphones... gone... I need one.\n\n$Trainee was staring at me, with a mixture of surprise and disbelief on his face. To his defense, I was the one who barged in at the closing time with loony eyes.\n\n&gt; $Trainee : Hoy $Emp! Little help here ?\n\n$Emp recognizes me. He knows that I do visit frequently to the shop, but not enough to know me by my name.\n\n&gt; $Emp : What do you need, Sir ?\n\nBy now I realized the cause of $Trainee's confusion, and have managed to compose myself.\n\n&gt; $Me : Headphones.\n\nI see him shifting towards cellphone hands-free earphones.\n\n&gt; $Me : (defiantly) NO... HEAD. PHONES.\n\nHe makes a shifty movement back to his original place. Stands there, again in confusion. I realize that I was the only customer in the closing shop. I realized that this, was, definitely a bad time. But I *NEEDED* head phones. (To clarify, I was indeed planning on buying headphones for a while, but my earphones were too good and comfy for me to let go) I understood his confusion, as the shop mostly stocked cellphones and its accessories. So proper 3.5mm headphones with no built-in mic was an odd demand indeed.\n\n&gt; $Owner : Sir, you need HEAD-PHONES ?\n\nHe had stepped in now.\n\n&gt; $Me : Yes...\n\nHe promptly grabs some $iBall_Rocky headphones and places them on the glass counter. But they were the ones with mic and a separate 3.5mm Audio-In jack in addition to 3.5mm Audio-out, the ones you typically use with Desktop Computers.\n\n&gt; $Me : Oh Come On! This ? Are you serious ? \n\nBy now I had pulled out my phone, in the desperate attempt to get them to see my point \n\n$Owner now grabs a $JBL from the side cupboard. It wasn't kept on display, as not many people actually buy it. Most buyers around here are completely fine with cellphone hands-free earphones, actually, they *demand* those.\n\n&gt; $Owner : (Decisively) There you go... That'll be INR 2500.\n\n&gt; $Me : Oh. I was expecting something along the lines of say - INR 500 ?\n\nThe headphones were indeed of good quality. I'd know because my brother uses a similar model. But my recent loss and a cost tag of INR 2.5k made my stomach turn a bit. But I could see $Emp and $Trainee boiling up to extreme levels and I knew why. I was being an asshole here. But $Owner, who knew me by name, also knew that I'm not usually like this. I've always been super nice to him and his employees on every other occasion. \n\n&gt; $Owner : Sorry $MyName, I don't have headphones and the quality you need in that price range.\n\n&gt; $Me : Okay. I'll get those then. Seems like I don't really have a choice here.\n\n&gt; $Owner : Hang on, I'll knock off the price for ye'. I know you. You're one of our regular customers.\n\nPromptly, he gave me a heafty 40% flat discount, knocking off the price to 1.5k. I quickly handed him over my card, while apologizing over any inconvenience I have caused. I know now that apologizing doesn't really cut it, but that's the least I could do.\n\nThe good old $Owner knocked off INR 100 more from the price while swiping the card, saying that it's okay, we all have our bad and worse days.     \n",

        "text": "Let me preface this by saying I've worked in call centers, I do not believe in taking out anger on employees for things beyond their control, and I do not like to be an asshole. But the customer service experience I had trying to give an emergency room my travel insurance information over the phone put me over the edge.\n\nI was travelling to the US, my home country, from Germany, the country where I live full-time as a resident. It was just a two week holiday to see friends and family. My healthcare situation in Germany is awesome, I'm insured through my wife's job and she doesn't pay a cent more to insure me. When I visit doctors, there are no copays. And I was able to purchase comprehensive travel insurance for 10 euros (by comparison, it's at least 100 euros to get good travel insurance if you're coming from America). \n\nThat insurance purchase turned out to be the best 10 euros I'd ever spend because I ended up with sudden, severe pain from an abscess tooth. I've had toothaches, migraines, and ear infections in the past. The pain of this tooth was all of those times a million. It was bad enough pain that I was briefly losing consciousness. I had been to a dentist earlier that day, he looked but couldn't find anything wrong. He thought it was a temporary bout of sensitivity, gave me pain relieving mouthwash and told me to take as much ibuprofen as I want. But the pain worsened throughout the afternoon and evening, and at 1AM I was screaming in agony. My wife took me to the ER. I gave them my insurance info, I got a CT scan, they gave me one amoxicillin and one percocet and prescriptions for both. The percocet dulled the pain to a tolerable level. Two days later, I saw an endodontist who sawed down my tooth which fixed the pain and left me fine until my root canal back in Germany.\n\nI got a bill in the mail for $7400 saying I needed to verify my insurance info or the payment would be due in full immediately. I called the customer service number to give them my health insurance info. Welcome to hell.\n\nFully automated and the machine never offered me an option to talk to an operator. Worse, it was the kind you could only speak into, you couldn't use the number pad on your phone to enter information. What would you say if a machine asked you for you birthday? \"Fourth September Nineteen-ninety\"? \"September 4 nineteen-ninety\"? \"Nine four ninety\" \"Nine zero four one nine one zero\"? I tried at least at 8 different variations and couldn't proceed without it. When I finally gave it my birthday correctly, I found there was no option on the menu to update insurance info. \n\nI called the actual ER itself and told them I needed customer service with an actual person. They transferred me back to the machine. I called the ER again and said I needed someone there now who would take care of this. A woman started taking my information but then informed me they needed a US billing address for my insurance. \n\nMakes sense, right? Clearly your travel insurance has a billing address inside the country you're going to! Ireland, Germany, China, Japan, they all have US billing addresses, duh! I explained the absurdity of this. I was transferred.\n\nThe next person at the next call center said the lines were too busy and that she would call me back. I started giving her my phone number. She said \"I'm sorry, we can't dial out of the country.\" I said I would wait on hold and she said \"no, you have to disconnect, try calling us again later.\" \n\nI called AGAIN. I immediately said \"I have been on the phone a very long time, I have not yet talked to one person capable of taking my insurance information which seems like a simple and straightforward thing. I want assistance now.\"\n\nGuess what I got told: \"We can't bill an address outside of the USA. You should pay the bill ($7400) and go through your insurance for a refund.\" I lost it, and said something like this: \n\n\"I know this call is recorded, so I want you to keep in mind what your bosses and auditors are about to hear. I have insurance which will pay 100% of the bill if you would only make the effort of contacting them. \n\nThis bill doesn't mean shit to me, do you think I'm giving $7400 out of my own pocket? I don't even have a credit card. I live in Germany, I don't have any assets to my name and I have nothing to lose. I can ignore this fucking bill if I want to, what do you think you can do about it? Nothing. You can't do jack shit, so I'm about to hang up and forget about this and you're about to lose $7400 you will never get.\n\nSo you explain to your boss that you asked me for insurance information, I provided it to you, and they will pay this bill in full if someone was smart enough to send a letter, email, or make a phone call. You asked me for the name, the group number, my insurance number and their billing address. You can either take this information, bill my insurance, and have the bill paid, or you can keep insisting that sending a letter to Germany is beyond anyone's ability, and you can tell your boss that you could have had $7400 but you said no thanks.\" \n\nGuess who suddenly figured out how to contact an insurance company in Germany. Glad this shit is over. ",

As he saw us approaching he ushered my friend and I to step ahead of him in line. I was confused at first. He didn't look to be still deciding on a purchase or otherwise unready. Thankfully he so graciously explained that his 'daddy' taught him to do the right thing and always allow women ahead of him in line. Cue internal groaning. Despite disagreeing completely with his reasoning, I figured I might as well take advantage of the offer. My friend does the same and as we move in the woman ahead of us smiles and indicates he had also allowed her to go ahead of him. We begin to wait patiently in line.\n\nCue the complaining. After letting three women ahead of himself this guy has the audacity to start complaining that the lines are taking too long (they weren't) and at this rate he's never going to check out (possibly true, depending on the number of female shoppers still needing to check out). He then loudly announces that he clearly should have gone to XYZ grocery store because obviously the lines would be faster there. Better hope XYZ store only has shoppers with XY chromosomes or else you'll be screwed there too buddy boy...\n\nSome people make their own damn problems.",

They treat me very well and I try to do the same.\n\nI'm not trying to toot my own horn with this post, but maybe give hope to bartenders who are run ragged, and let them know that when they are awesome, sometimes folks try to be awesome back...\n\nI got paid yesterday and went out for a few drinks. As I ordered my second, I overheard the bartender telling another patron that some customers walked out on their tab. She was bummed, I imagine because because this is the slow season and every dollar counts.\n\nI asked, \"How much was it?\" She said it was $33. \"Ok. Put it on my tab.\"\n\nShe looked at me like I was insane. \"Why?\" And I was like, \"Well, I just got paid. I have a little extra. I feel like being nice. And I need all the karma I can get right now.\" Tried to laugh it off.\n\nShe was very taken aback and thanked me. She ended up giving me 2 of my 5 drinks for free. When we both ended up at the same house party after closing, she thanked me again. She was super sweet about it but it was no bigs.\n\nHonestly, I could have used that $33, but in the end all I have to do is NOT go out to eat one day this week and it will have paid for itself. And I have desk jobs - one of the reasons I don't work food service is because I don't think I could handle the physical demands. I'm sure she was tired. So if I made her night a little less shitty that's good for me.",

Every transaction, your pockets got a little bit heavier with the change we received.\n\nWe arrive at our hotel in Tampa, and we're hungry.  We thankful that there is one of those national chain restaurants attached to the hotel that loves a certain day of the week, so we decide to grab some grub.\n\nOur waiter takes about 30 minutes to take our drink orders, leaves to speak with another table, that little did we know, would be an issue, he then another 30 to take our food orders.  When we finally start to eat, we run out of drinks.  Waiter is still standing at the other table, 15 feet away talking to some girls he probably thinks he's going to take home after his shift, and won't even glance our way.  I walk up to the bar and ask for refills and a bottle of ketchup, because we're truly Midwestern and eat ketchup with everything.\n\n45 minutes to an hour later we're done and just chatting about the plans for the weekend, and our waiter still hasn't come back, but he's still speaking with the girls 15 feet away from us.\n\nI go again to the bar to ask for our bills, and the bartender waives him down and I see the sour look on his face when he realizes that he's being beckoned away from his \"score\".  We pay, and being young and naive still leave a tip, but we instead tip with the change we had acquired along the trip.  I would estimate that this change would actually be about a 20% tip, which he definitely didn't work for.\n\nAs we're walking out of the restaurant, he runs up to us with fistfuls of change saying, \"YOU FORGOT YOUR CHANGE!\"\n\nWe just kept walking, needless to say I haven't been back to one of these restaurants based on this one experience.\n\nTL;DR: Crappy waiter, tipped with change acquired from long road trip, crappy waiter was angry.",

This is her story, not mine, but I'll try and remember the details she told me to the best of my ability. \n\n\nIt happened about 3 years ago at a large fast food chain, known for its golden arches. My mom (M) had a later schedule for work that morning and decided to stop in for cheap coffee and a breakfast burrito to treat herself for having time for breakfast. \n\n\nM said there had been a lot of people during this morning block. She had to wait 10 minutes to get her food, but it was understandable as they were slammed. Cashier was pleasant, everyone was waiting their turn, etc. \n\n\nM opened her breakfast burrito to put salsa on it and nearly threw up. Why? One of the workers had left a nice gift in the burrito. A fresh, bloody bandaid. Naturally, M was disgusted and grabbed the burrito in its open position and her coffee brought it to the counter to flag down a cashier (C). \n\n\nM: Hi I just wanted to show you that I found this in my food and would like a refund on this and my coffee. I just want my money back. I don't have an appetite after finding this in my meal. \n\n\nC: Okay. Sorry about that ma'am. Sure you don't want another one?\n\n\nM: I'm sure. \n\n\nSo the cashier refunds her burrito, but not her coffee. \n\n\nM: You only refunded me for my burrito. \n\n\nC: Well the coffee is fine. You can still drink that. \n\n\nM: But I asked for a refund for both. \n\n\nC: Just drink the coffee.\n\n\nThe cashier then motioned for the next person in line. My mom wasn't going to leave without all her money because it should have been easy to refund for both since it cost less than $4. She proceeded to speak much louder so everyone could hear her. \n\n\nM: You mean to tell me that I can't get a refund for my whole order because the BLOODY BANDAID wasn't in my coffee?\n\n\nCashier becomes embarrassed after realizing how ridiculous he was being and refunded her, but not before half the potential business they had heard the exchange and decided to eat elsewhere for their morning fix. \n\n\nTl;dr: if someone wants their whole order refunded, best to do it instead of losing half of your morning rush.

But this experience will always sit with me as a reminder to avoid this local place.\n\nIt was a cold winter morning, and my car wasn't starting. It had been starting inconsistently and I was unsure if it was the battery or alternator. I had towing through my insurance so I was going to tow it to Autozone for them to test. The tow truck driver offered to drive it to their shop, which did both repair and towing, and offered a discount for doing so. I took him up on it, and asked if they could look at the heat not working. He agreed.\n\nOf course, by the time they get to looking at the car, it had warmed up a little and my car was working. They claimed to run tests and everything was fine, and it was probably just the cold preventing it from starting. This was a red flag for me, but I figured it'd be better to pick it up and go with my original plan.\n\nHe also mentioned that the heat not working was just a matter of putting antifreeze in there and it was good to go. I went and paid the bill for the tow and antifreeze (I didn't know they would just do that or I would have told them I'd do it on my own).\n\nA few days later though, my heat stopped working and I called them up. I suspected there was a leak (which it was), because smoke was coming from under the hood but the car was driving fine. It was just antifreeze leaking.\n\nThe guy said, \"Yeah I was the one you talked to over the phone. I told you you had a leak but you just wanted to put antifreeze in it instead of paying more to fix the problem.\" I got angry but I decided to not bother with it. It was my word against his, I didn't have a recording of that phone conversation. I maybe could have done more to get compensation from them but I'm honestly not sure.",

Property Management told us to drive over to their office miles away and buy one for $100. Annoying, but not the end of the world. When I get the new key in my hand, I notice the teeth don't match my own key.\n\n&gt; \"Don't worry, it'll work fine.\"\n\nNot being a locksmith I take them at their word and drive home. Surprise! The key does not work. We turn around and drive back. They dissappear into the back room for a long time with an excessive amount of jingling, then reappear with a replacement key. This too, does not match.\n\n&gt; \"I checked, that one will work.\"\n\nI have no idea what the clerk checked, but the key does not work either. So we drive over there for the third time.

I checked again, it's coming out of the right bin, it's the right number.\"\n\nI protest that locks don't read numbers written on keys. I get nowhere. We drive home.

Return to the office for a fourth time and ask\n\n&gt; me: \"here's my known good key. Here's the key that doesn't work.

One second.\"\n\nShe disappears for *mere seconds* this time, before returning with a key that matches without needing my key for reference.\n\nI drive home. It works.

        "text": "This happened close to a year ago, as it was during Lent last year and on a Friday. I was eating dinner with a coworker at an Italian restaraunt. Most meals came with soup or salad. I don't really like salad, but I didn't like any of the soups either. I asked if the chicken noodle soup had actual bits of chicken in there, or if they just used chicken broth. I explained it was during Lent so I couldn't eat meat that day. The waiter ensured me that it was just chicken broth and no pieces of chicken in there.\n\nI get my soup and see that there's pieces in there. I don't like to complain at restaurants but I had to explain to the waiter where something went wrong. He took the soup back and got his manager. I explained everything above to him, and the manager seemed perplexed that the waiter would do that, but he was very apologetic and offered me something else. I let him know I was thinking about dessert, so after my meal they brought out one for free.\n\nTo this day I'm still confused as to how the waiter misunderstood me, when I was as clear as I could be.",

        "text": "I rode the campus bus service as an undergrad when it was colder than I felt like walking in. It wasn't usually a long walk from my apartment to any of my classes, and I enjoyed the exercise in the morning, but my university was on the side of a mountain. It was cold most of both semesters. \n\nOnce in a while, as is not unusual (not frequent, but we've all been there, right?), a bus would have a mechanical problem, need more fuel, etc., and all the passengers would be told to get off and wait for the next bus. One day after class I was riding back to my apartment and found myself alone on the bus. Again, not unusual; the stop before mine was the last dorm stop and I quite often was the only passenger going to the stop near my apartment complex. The bus would then go back to campus and start the route again. Only we weren't going to my apartment complex. \n\nWe were going down a steep hill toward the bus garage. I wasn't sure what to do. Was it safe to get up and start walking toward the driver? Would he hear me if I just yelled and waved my arms? I decided to stand up, wave, and shout, causing the driver to stop the bus pretty quickly (good thing I didn't start walking up the aisle, right?).\n\nThe driver insisted that he looked in the mirror and didn't see anyone so he did not announce that the bus was out of service. I wasn't upset and even offered to walk the rest of the way--we were only about one block away from the stop. I don't know if there was a rule or if the driver just wanted to make up for his mistake, but I ended up riding down the hill, around the corner to the bus garage, turning around, going back up the hill (at, like 5 mph because steep hill and old bus), and to the stop. I would have preferred the walk for the amount of time and trouble it was for both of us.",

        "text": "I'm not sure if this belongs here but idk where else to post it.\n\nMy family and I were traveling (by car) around Europe on holiday. At some place in France, we stopped at a hotel. We asked for a room for 5 (2 adults and 3 children), but they said they only had rooms for 4. We asked if we could move another bed/mattress in there but they said no. We decided to just have one of us (me) sleep on a duvet we brought with us.\n\nWhen we got to the room, it was just a single room, with a tiny bathroom and a shower with a handle missing. All the walls were painted red and there was a strong cigarette smell. We complained to them but they said it was the only room they had. Later on, as we were about to go to bed, we decided to turn on the air conditioning. It didn't work.\n\nWe went downstairs to ask if they could fix it but they said there was nothing they could do. We tried to go to sleep, but it was the summer and boiling hot. The beds were horrible too. We tried to get the shower working so they put a new handle on for us but the hot water didn't work anyway.\n\nWe were just getting into bed when a hotel staff burst through the door, without even knocking and said they had a solution for the air con. After taking about 30 minutes or so, he said there was nothing he could do. He also smelled strongly of BO.\n\nIn the end, we gave up and spent a whole lot of money on a really nice hotel. ",
