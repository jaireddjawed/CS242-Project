        "text": "My (M23) and girlfriend (F21) have been dating for about 5 months. Everything has been great and we’ve not argued or had any relationship problems to this point. \n\nShe is friends with a guy who we will called Steve. She told me they tried to date but it didn’t work and they stopped talking until January. He would message her to talk about nursing school since they are both nursing majors. They would talk about other things as well on a daily basis but never see each other in person. \n\nI assumed that she meant they tried to date for like 1-2 days in middle school so I didn’t care. The other day she told me they tried to date about 10 months ago for 2 months and have made out but he friendzoned her. \n\nI brought it up to her that it made me uncomfortable she is talking to him which she didn’t understand (she has never been in a relationship so she doesn’t know what is generally okay and wrong to do in one). She realized it was wrong once I asked how she would feel if I was talking to someone I had the same history with.\n\nI don’t want to tell her to stop talking to someone because I think that is a toxic thing to do but I was hinting at it. It took a little while until she asked what I would do (I have much more relationship experience). I said I would tell him I won’t be talking to him anymore which she did right away and unfollowed him. \n\nShe said after that she didn’t realize it was wrong until I mentioned it and blamed her lack of relationship experience. She was also completely open and was offering to show/tell me anything I wanted. \n\nI’m glad she took the action of not talking to him right away. I was hurt that she was talking to him but it sounded like it was a misunderstanding from her because she has never been in a relationship and they are not technically EX’s.\n\nTL;DR: my girlfriend is online friends with someone she tried to date for 2 months and made out with. She says she didn’t realize it was wrong but now understands why I felt bad about it.",

        "text": "Me(F20) and my boyfriend (M21) have been dating for 5 years now, since we were teens, met in highschool, same class, etc. I´ve never had any issue with how he behaves with other female friends he has, he's what I like to call a \"social butterfly\" and tends to make friends pretty quickly. He and his friends went on vacation in February of 2022, they met two sisters, let's call them V(F18) and N(F21) who they recognized that went to a school trip with our school and joined our friend group throughout the months. My boyfriend is really touchy and affectionate, he's like that with all of his friends both male and female. I´ve noticed that he has this behavior with both of them but he being affectionate with V made me feel really insecure and sad (I do struggle with low self esteem, depression and anxiety, I compare myself a lot to her and always have the feeling that I'm not good enough for anyone and that he will realize she's better than me and dump me, also physical touch for me is something really intimate and I don't do it with everyone), we talked about it but I think I just covered the issue with jokes and every time I thought I got over it, we got together with the whole group and he seemed to be affectionate to her(play fighting, winking, blowing kisses, hugging) the same way he is with me. He told me he would try to stop or limit that behavior around her but he just ended up avoiding talking about her altogether with me.  \nA few days ago I found out through N while talking on discord that V had gone to his house and he didn't mention anything (we tend to talk about everything) and I started to overthink and got really upset and started being cold to him, we ended up talking yesterday and he told me that he talked with his therapist and he was going to stop avoiding her and being affectionate with her around me because It's who he is and he just sees her as a little sister and nothing else and that the whole issue comes from my insecurities and he can't do anything and it's in me to do my part (It was a really long, deep and wholesome talk but don't want to make it really long). I really want to trust him, never had an issue with trusting but I just end up overthinking a lot and comparing myself to her because I can't seem to understand why he keeps choosing me.  \nI told him that I was going to try and improve my self esteem and work it with my therapist, but I also know that it will take time and V and I are starting to become really good friends (I do struggle with making friends too) and don't want that to deteriorate my relationship with him and this new friendship with her over me being insecure. So if anyone has tips on how to stop feeling bad or just knowing how to cope with those feelings, when situations like this happen, without shutting down completely and hurting him and maybe what you think about the whole situation.  \n\n\n TL;DR: I tend to overthink how my really affectionate boyfriend behaves around a our female friend I think is prettier and better than me, need tips to cope with this feelings in the meantime while I work it with my therapist so I don't shut down verbally and hurt him.\n\n  \nThanks for reading!",

        "text": "Been with my GF for 5 years now, things are serious, planning on proposing later this year. Things are great between her and I, but she’s got a serious issue with seemingly becoming sick before big events with my family and friends, and it’s becoming a dealbreaker. In the last year, she cancelled day before on a wedding that we were supposed to go to, and I went alone. She also claimed she was sick for an event with a large group of my friends, and New Years Eve as well as she was sick. She’s afraid to visit my place and spend time with my family (we both still live with our families), and now, with my sisters baby shower this week, she’s claiming she’s coming down with something and doesn’t know if she’ll go. To her credit, she doesn’t miss everything, but it’s frequent enough to notice a pattern. Between her and I, things are okay, but I don’t believe her, and at the same time would feel awful if I was wrong, but my family and friends don’t really like my gf because it seems like I’m always making excuses for things she doesn’t want to go to. I just find it hard to believe she’s always sick right when something big is coming up, and my family has outright told me they don’t like her because of that, and my mother has said she won’t support me getting married to her if she keeps skipping out on big family things. Obviously I’m a grown man, and my family’s opinion of who I do and don’t date is more an annoyance than anything else, but I’m tired of covering for her when I myself don’t believe she wants to come to these events, and I’ve already discussed with her that it cannot be she gets sick every time some event comes up. If I’m wrong I’m acting like a jerk, which I agree with, but it feels like a boy who cried wolf situation. I’m trying to be sympathetic to the situation, but at this point I can’t be. In this specific situation, I told her if she’s doing that bad she should go to a dr, and she refuses to. Should I just tell her the truth that my family, who she asks whether they like her or not a lot, would be really mad if she didn’t go to the shower? I don’t want to do this back and forth anymore.\n\nTL;DR: my GF tends to get sick around big family/friend events and she’s already saying she’s sick before my sisters baby shower this week.",

        "text": "My close friends ignored my birthday and I feel very disrespected\n\nOne year ago I formed a group of friends with 4 people (2 boys, 2 girls) from the place we all started to attend to at the time. Since then we were hanging out often, went on holiday together. I was always there for them to help them with anything, to solve conflicts, find a job, take care od them. We celebrated birthday of each person by planning a surprise party weeks ahead, buying presents and some special custom birthday cake etc. I must admit I was never the main organiser, but I always gave ideas for the gifts and was very enthusiastic for birthdays. Finally, my 25th birthday came to be celebrated last. All I got from them were text messages from the girls. Guys didn't even say a single word. I feel sad about it. :(\n\nMy birthday date is available on Facebook and we have a shared online calendar for birthdays.\n\nI didn't expect much, but I think as an equal group member, it would be plain courtesy, to just meet at that day (not even as surprise) and just sing happy birthday. Anything extra would be to purposedly make me happy.\n\nTwo weeks earlier one friend had his birthday and it was tone of effort to organise it. Just by comparison, skipping my birthday shows they don't really respect or care for me.\n\nI don't know what to do about it. I don't have many friends and it is difficult to find new ones, so I don't want to cut them off. I quite enjoy spending time together. \n\nI don't even have parents or girlfriend, so I feel very lonely.\n\nI don't want to talk to them about it, because that would be awkward. I don't believe there could be any specific reason to miss it other than them not caring enough. Maybe something is wrong with me, maybe I haven't form a strong enough bond with them.\n\nWhat do you think? What should I do?\n\nTL;DR My birthday was completly ignored whereas the rest of the group had cool surprise parties.",

        "text": "I (19f) met him (20m) a year ago in a university zoom tutoring session and there was an instant connection when we talked to each other that I had never felt with anyone before. He asked for my discord, and ever since then, we have been chatting with each other constantly. The problem is that our friendship does not feel fulfilling due to the disconnect of it being situated entirely online.\n\nWhenever I try to ask him about hanging out, he always diverts the conversation or makes up excuses as to why he can't make it last minute. I found that he doesn't do this kind of behavior with his other friends and it seems to be an issue with me only. The most we'll do is call on a somewhat frequent basis, but he never wants to show his face.\n\nHe has always come off as a very private person, as he doesn't like to talk much about his personal life. I know that he has some trauma from his past friendships, particularly with girls, but he has barely brought it up. Nevertheless, he is extremely sweet, caring, and is always a great listener when I want to talk or vent about whatever.\n\nFrom the start, this relationship has been in a strange spot. He confessed his feelings for me only a couple weeks into us knowing each other, and I honestly did not know how to respond. Not long after I started to develop them back as well. We never attempted dating, but it was clear that what was going on wasn't completely platonic. The few times we actually hung out irl, he kept hugging me and we held hands. We would flirt all the time for months and I didn't even feel weird about it.\n\nThis stopped after the last time we were hanging out in-person last November, but all the regular communication hasn't. He'll always initiate convos with me and this goes on to hundreds of messages each day. It has become so ingrained into my daily routine that I can't imagine not doing it at this point. I have no idea what to think anymore.\n\ntl;dr: Guy friend is interested in texting with me everyday but is aversive to doing any non-virtual activities, making the relationship feel incomplete.",

        "text": "Hello everyone. I'm a 20 year old (M) college student who used to work with a much older woman (35F). I always found her attractive. In my eyes she was the the prettiest woman I've ever seen in my life (she actually looked much younger than her age).\n\nAnyways we started talking at work and we had chemistry. We pretty much liked the same things and we had great conversations. As  time went on and on, things got more intimidating. She started starring at me in a very intimadating way. She also started texting me daily and consistently. I knew that she was in a relationship with another guy and i just thought she was just being friendly.\n\nBut one day, she told me to hang out after work together. And we did. I had an amazing time with her. I honestly haven't met anyone that interesting in my life. As i was walking her home, she caught me off guard and kissed me. It was the sweetest kiss I've had ever experienced. I told her i liked her a lot and so did she. I always had in my mind that i shouldn't get into other people's relationship and i genuinely felt bad about her boyfriend. But i couldn't resist to her, it was magical. \n\nWe worked for 3 months together (basically all summer). This was honestly the best time of my life. We started dating somehow. (we kept it between us, but we started seeing each other a lot). She's the most amazing woman I've ever met, idk if her age makes me think of that. Maybe it's her maturity Thad made me fell so hard for her? I'm not sure. Anyway, the thing after summer was over, i left the job, because of college. And after this happened she somehow disappeared. She suddenly started texting me rarely and she was cold, but nothing had happened between us. I kept texting her and asking about how she was, but after some time she ghosted me.\n\nIt's been half a year since we texted each other. I honestly can't stop thinking of her. She's been living in my head 24/7, i can't concentrate on anything and most importantly in my studies. I just think of her and cry, i can't even listen to music anymore, because we had the same taste and the songs remind of her, why did she do that to me? Why she initiated the whole thing if she's was going to do that without explain anything to me. She promised me that she would keep in touch with me no matter what. And i believed her. I know the age gap is huge, but i didn't mind, that's what she said as well. I feel like i was being used.  \n\nI also bear in mind that she was cheating on her boyfriend, and i don't know if i would like to be with someone who's a cheater. I just feel so depressed and don't know how to get over her. I know some of you might say you can find other people as well, but i literally had one gorgeous girl asking me to have sex with her and i declined, because while she was talking with me, i was only thinking about her. It feels like I've developed an obsession with her and it's unhealthy. I've been with other women before, but this just felt so special to me, i can't really explain it. I feel so blank. I've been waiting for a text from her every single day, and the urge of texting her is huge, idk if she's gonna reply or not. did she just play me? I just crave of seeing her just one more time. She stigmatized me. Every other girl i meet, i subconsciously compare her to her and she's always better. I can't feel anything for other girls and it's been a long time. I'm so embarrassed of going to therapy because a woman 15 years older played me like that. \n\nTL;DR i had an affair with a much older co-worker, and when she left the job she stopped texting to me, but i can't get over her.\n\nPS: excuse me for my English, im Argentinian.",

I had an argument with her about something stupid and knocked her phone out of her hand,m unintentionally causing it to crack. She complained a lot about it and after saying sorry one I just started to say it was no big deal. Finally, after she complained again I looked at her boyfriend and said in an exasperated voice: \" \"If you keep your pimp hand strong she'd be in line a lot more.\" \n\nThe words barely left my mouth that he slapped me extremely sharply on the face. I could feel my left cheek burning and it felt extremely shaming. I sat down quietly and none of us said anything for the next 10 minutes and then I went to my room.\n\nThat night we were going to a house party and though we all went it felt quite awkward. After he left today I mentioned it to my sister and she told me she wasn't talking to me, and that she \"fully, 100% agreed with what he did\". And that if he hadn't, she would have been the one to slap me.\n\nNo one has ever struck me, not even our parents, and absolutely never on the face.  People here told me I was the one at fault, and I finally said sorry both to my sister and her boyfriend. I just said to her boyfriend I wish he hadn't slapped me, and he said, \"If you wish that, you don't get it. I didn't slap you hard enough\" And walked out. \n\nEven our parents said they fully supported the slap he gave me and that I should be ashamed of himself. I am just upset that no one is in my corner and I think I deserve some support. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: I made a sexist joke at my sister's expense to her boyfriend, and he hit me on the face, which she supports, as well as our parents, support.",

If you feel as though I was in the wrong or if you feel like we both were feel free to give me your honest opinion. I’m not looking to place blame, I know relationships takes two people but I just want others opinions to see if maybe there were things I should have done differently. \n\nFor the first month we hung out and talked/texted everyday before we were exclusive. I know that sounds like we rushed into things but I fell for her hard and knew that I wanted something serious with her. Shortly after a month we made it official and we were both already saying I love you. We were both talking about a future and felt that we genuinely had something special.

Again probably sounds silly so early but when you know you know right?\n\nAnyways, In the first month, all the honeymoon phase things were happening. You know the being all over each other, sex basically every time we were together and just not being able to get enough of each other. I know these things don’t last forever but after the first month things slowed down pretty quick. I wouldn’t expect this to slow down for Atleast the first 3-6 months or even longer. \n\nWe went about 2 weeks without doing anything sexual. The affection was still there some but not as much. I’m a very sexual and affectionate person and I have a high libido. The first couple times she rejected my sexual advances I felt as though I handled it well. Didn’t make a big deal about it but it happened again a few days later (probably about the week and a half mark) and I get visibly frustrated about it. She could tell. At this time I ask her “ Is something wrong? It’s been awhile since we’ve done anything and I can’t help but feel like something is off?” She assures me it’s her birth control and that she has always had a low libido. I take her word for it and I listened to her and tried to understand but the feelings were still there cause it didn’t make sense to me how that infatuation period could just end after only a month. \n\nAnother few days goes by and these feelings are still stirring and it’s obvious to her. My demeanor around her is different and it’s obvious I’m upset about something. I feel dumb for this cause it’s not the way to act but I couldn’t help that I was feeling these things. I was being short over text one day and she texts and asks “what’s wrong?” I bring it up again and say “I just can’t help but feel like it’s something else going on as to why things have been this way between sexually?” At this point she gets very upset and feels as though that’s all I think about or want from her is sex and we don’t talk much the rest of the day. \n\nThe next day was our dinner for valentines and we still went things were awkward at first but as the night went on we still had a good dinner. Later after the dinner I tell her “I think we need to talk about how our convo went yesterday” and after trying to explain to her that I just don’t understand how things are going how they are and that I feel like maybe it’s something more than the BC she gets very mad and upset and goes on about how it made her feel like that’s all I’m worried about or how I was insinuating that maybe there was someone else and I assured her that it just made me feel like I did something wrong in the bedroom or that she just didn’t desire me anymore for some other reason. Either way the convo didn’t go well as she got very upset and it just wasn’t a healthy discussion at all. We ended up having sex later that night and it felt somewhat forced. \n\nAfter that I let it go and tried not to bring it up again. We went another week or so without much going on and then we went on a trip out of town. Things during the trip were great. The whole time it was like things were back to normal. \n\nWe get back from the trip and I come over to her place one night a few days later and I try to advance on her and I get rejected. \n\nAt this point, I’m fixating and obsessing over the fact that our sex just isn’t that frequent and I wasn’t sure how to talk to her about it after how the last convo went. Eventually I bring it up and she just says she doesn’t know what I want her to do about it. She just doesn’t want to have sex as much as I do. And I made it clear that I don’t want her to do anything she doesn’t want to do. At this point I’m just going to Try and let it go and see how things go. I felt like I had already done damage to the relationship by bringing up these feelings I was having and this made me uneasy. \n\nLater that day we go to a dinner party with friends. At one point during the party some friends broke out some drugs. I’m not going to specify but they don’t last long at all and I partake socially with friends and only every once in a while. I did some while she was there even though she had told me she didn’t want me doing them around her. She was actually napping at the time (she was very tired) so she didn’t know I did them until I told her I did on our way home. She got upset, rightfully so as I crossed a boundary and I apologized and told her that it would never happen again. Even though I thought it wasn’t that big of a deal I didn’t consider how it would make her feel and I was wrong for that. \n\nThe next day we go almost all day with out talking. I could tell she was still a bit upset before I left her house. Later that day I ask her if we are ok? And she goes on about how she hated how I did that around her and I apologize again and reassure her that it won’t happen again. \n\nThe next day in the afternoon after work I ask her if we had any plans with anyone this weekend coming up. She says no and I proceed to make plans. I ask if she’d like to cook dinner together, watch movies and just have some us time cause we hadn’t been able to all weekend cause we were busy. She says “possibly ya” and at this point I’m like “so do you have other plans” and she says “no but she doesn’t know what her friend is doing this weekend” (this is a friend that’s a girl but I’m leaving out her name). To me this was odd cause until that point she hadn’t put off making plans with me for her friends and after everything else that had happened recently it just kinda got me upset. So I tell her this and that it got me upset cause we hadn’t had any time for just us all weekend and basically none the week before too. She proceeds to say that’s fine we can hangout Friday then which felt like I forced her so I just told her not to worry about it and we can play things by ear. She says no I want to and I respond with no it’s really ok but I just left it at that cause at this point I’m mad about how the convo went. \n\nWe don’t talk the rest of the night and then I see she leaves her apartment (we have each other on Life360 for safety purposes). I wasn’t tracking her but it notifies you when people leave their home. She set it up this way. So another hour or so goes by and I see she hasn’t returned home so I check the app to see her location is off. At this point I’m freaking out. I end up FaceTiming her while angry cause everything in my mind says something is going on and I say “why is your location off” you could tell I was angry and it definitely wasn’t the correct way for me to handle that. I’m not very proud of myself for acting that way. I feel horrible about it actually. It felt so out of character. She hasn’t given me any reason to think she would do something behind my back but with everything that happened that led up to it I let my thoughts take over and acted out. \n\nShe messages me the next morning and says we need to talk to which I go over later after work and she says that FT was the last straw for her. She didn’t feel like I trusted her after the FT the previous night and she didn’t feel like she could give me what I want which was someone that wanted to have sex all the time. After some more discussion she ended up telling me that me bringing up sex multiple times (we only had two sit down discussions about it) made her not want to and it also made her not want to be around me as much cause it felt like there was an expectation. I ask her why she never brought these feelings up before and it made me feel like it wasn’t just the BC. I feel like if she had communicated that to me earlier I could have tried to chill out and just not worry about it as much \n\nSo now I’m upset cause I feel like I messed up the whole relationship by trying to communicate something that was bothering me. I may not have gone about something’s the best way but I was working with the information I was given. This whole thing has me feeling super embarrassed about how I acted and I really wanted it to work out. \n\nWe are currently NC and I don’t plan to reach out. I’m unsure if I’d take her back cause I know that I need someone who has a similar sex drive to me and is also into being very affectionate but I genuinely love her and miss what we had in the beginning. She left me so I feel as though she should have to come back to me and want things to work if we were going to try again. I was very upset In front of her when she was breaking up with me and it was clear that I didn’t want things to end. It’s only been a week since the break up. \n\nI know this was a lot. I appreciate any advice or input on the situation. \n\nTLDR; dated a girl for 2-3 months. First month was great with honeymoon phase things. Sex fell off after one month and got insecure feelings about it. Brought it up trying to communicate my feelings and it seemed to push her away. We broke up and no I feel as though I messed it all up. Please give me your opinion on how I handled it.",

        "text": "My friend doesn’t have kids, but wants them. I have one child who is a year old. We live in different states, but have been best friends since high school. We were keeping in touch pretty often over text before I felt upset by this. \n\nI texted her on a day in late February where I was really struggling emotionally, saying “I think I might have postpartum depression or something.”\n\nShe responds, “How?” And I say, “I don’t know, I just don’t feel like myself.” \n\nShe texts back, “Could just be you being depressed? I mean I don’t know cause you be around (my child) a lot. And haven’t thought about killing her or yourself.”\n\nI just had no idea what to say to this. I guess the mention of wanting to kill my child really threw me off, and upset me, because yeah, I don’t feel that way, but that’s not the only symptom of PPD. I just texted back, “idk,” thinking that she would move on from that and ask me how I’m feeling instead. But all she said was, “Well I guess when you figure it out, let me know,” and then that was just it?\n\nLike I said, I was already very emotional on this day, so I just really did not know what to say after that. When I was younger, I had the tendency to lash out when someone upset me, so now to prevent that, I just distance myself to figure out how I feel and decide whether I’m overreacting or not. I’ve had her texts on mute since then. I just discovered that she sent a text on the 9th of March saying she was proud of me. I didn’t see it until today since I had her muted. \n\nI still don’t really know what to say. AM I overreacting by being upset by the way she responded? It’s not so much her not understanding PPD that really bothers me. It’s the “when you figure it out, let me know.” When I figure out what? I don’t know, it just seemed like a very flippant response to me. \n\nI just don’t really know what to think or how to talk to her about it, if it’s even worth it.\n\nTLDR: I don’t know how to react after feeling brushed off by my friend.",

I’m not sure how to compromise on this and would love if I could get some advice from people.\n\n* Typical fight: He/I wants something that is opposite to what the other person wants. We ask nicely and disagree a couple times. I come up with a couple alternatives that I’m ok with instead and he comes up with a couple of alternatives that he’s ok with instead. We still can’t agree on any one alternative. \n   * Ending A: I give in and adapt. We move on. He doesn’t even realize this was a fight because I gave in without any sulking.\n   * Ending B: He gives in but says he’s very upset and unhappy with me about this and that he won’t speak with me for a couple days or whenever he feels better. I say that I’d rather give in or not do anything instead of deal with him sulking. He’s upset because he’s giving in but now he can’t even be honest about his emotions. The fight escalates - I cry, he/I shout, I keep crying, he apologizes but he doesn’t know for what. There’s no satisfactory ending - either he gives in temporarily (he has a really bad memory) or i give up or we leave the fight unresolved.\n* He wants me to be honest about my opinions and say what I want. Every disagreement will always have a winner and a loser. The loser is allowed to be upset and the winner should move on.\n* I don’t want to share my opinions anymore. I either don’t get what I want or I get it but have to deal with a wave of negativity that makes me lose any kind of happiness that I got from getting what I wanted in the first place. I feel like a loser in either scenario.\n* Note, I used to also do Ending A a lot earlier in our relationship but he’s been encouraging me to be more honest about my opinions so we keep getting into Ending B nowadays.\n* I’m wondering if we’re too deep into the problem to see any possible solutions. Are there any strategies that people can suggest? (Not looking to break up)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR; We’ve been fighting a lot lately over silly things.

        "text": "This is going to be bit of a long one.. \n\nI(21F) fucked things up pretty badly with a guy(21M) I’ve been seeing for 4 months. We both went on trips for spring break and talked before hand about if we would be hooking up with people while gone. He said he wasn’t planning on it and I said that I might. He left for his trip before me and the whole time he was away was making it seem like he didn’t hook up with anyone. He calls me on one of the last nights of my trip while I’m drunk and asks me about my day. I tell him about it and bring up a few interactions I had with guys, and then he asks if I’ve hooked up with anyone and I made a joke about having a threesome (he made one about having a foursome a few nights ago) he proceeds to hang up on me after this and we have an argument over text. I said some nasty things toward him that I now feel bad about it. I was basically upset because I know he was flirting and making out w/ (at the time I didn’t know he slept with anyone) girls over break yet he got pissy and hung up when I made a joke about a threesome. He said I was trying to make him jealous and it was childish. I felt like he was being a hypocrite. \n\nHe calls me back a bit after texting back and forth and 2 guys walk out of their room and try flirting with me, I’m still on the phone with him by this point and essentially tell the guys to fuck off and I start reassuring the guy I’m dating that I don’t plan on hooking up with anyone (I can tell he’s feeling pretty jealous and insecure at this point). This leads to me asking him if he had gotten with anybody to which he states he slept with 2 ppl. This sets me off because I don’t understand how he could hook up with people and then feel bad about me doing the same. Fast forward the 2 guys come out of their room again and I start to flirt with them while he’s on the phone. I say something along the lines of “yeah he’s annoying me and I’m about to hang up” when they bring up him being on the phone. He starts panicking and having an anxiety attack. I end the call telling him I’ll call back and he starts calling me multiple times and texting asking to please talk to me. He sends me a picture of us together and starts saying things like “if you care about me you wouldn’t get w/ anyone”, “if you see anything w/ me you wouldn’t do this, I want to be with you”, “I’m not going to get any sleep tonight because of this.” In the moment I felt he was being manipulative and hypocritical so I showed no empathy for him and we ended the call again soon after. \n\nI didn’t speak to him the day after that saying I didn’t feel like talking but I love him and will see him when I get back. A day after I get back he says we need to talk. We talk and he says I made him feel worthless by flirting with people in front of him and that I hurt him deeply. He said his intentions were never to hurt me with his actions but that my intentions were to hurt him. He told me he needs to take a step back from us and that whenever he thinks about me he gets angry by the situation. He told me to get my things from his place and to give him his clothes back. I did. He said he doesn’t know what he’s going to do but that he won’t be seeing me any time soon until he gets over it. I sent a voice note the other night telling him how sorry I was and that I’ll give him space until he cools off. \n\nI know I can’t really do much now because it’s all in his hands but I just feel like I fucked up what could’ve been the best relationship I’ve had. He was always so sweet and considerate of me and now I feel like I lost him. Should I send him a gift as an apology? Or just not speak to him? He said I could text him if I want but depending on how he feels he can’t guarantee he’ll respond. I just don’t know what to do or what to think at the moment… I don’t know how to fix things.\n\nTLDR::// Learned a guy I’m seeing slept with 2 girls while away on a guys trip. I proceeded to flirt with men in front of him while we were on the phone which led to him getting jealous and having a panic attack. Says I was being cruel and petty and that I hurt him deeply, and now wants to take a step back from us. Need advice on how to fix things\n\nFor clarity we are not official, just in the talking stage but have made it clear we would both like to get together in the near future.",

        "text": "Me and my girlfriend have been dating for a year and a half and we are have had an amazing relationship together so far, we really love each other and are truly each others best friends. We share very similar values, we trust each other, we respect each other and listen very well and we really know how to love each other in the best ways and have a great time while doing it. Even thought we are still very young and we have been in a long term relationship for a short time we have talked about eventually getting married and it really is a beautiful and comforting thought for both of us but she has also expressed that the thought of spending the rest of our lives together also scared her and this is where the main problem arises \n\nI have been in two relationships in high school and have had two other random hookups before we started dating while she has only ever been with me; i was her first kiss and everything else. In her words \"it has always been me\". This is where the problem arises. While she really truly does not care that i have been with other people in the past she recently she has been struggling with knowing if we truly are meant to be together or if what she is feeling is just because she is comfortable because she has no comparable experiences. We have talked about this a lot recently and it has deeply effected her mental state because she has a lot of guilt building up because she is terrified that she is wasting my time and my \"college years\". She has said that the thought of being with me forever is both an amazing idea but also its scares her because she is struggling with whether or not she is 100% sure of us. She believes that we have a really good chance of spending the rest of our lives together but she wants to be 100% sure in it because in her words she \"Is afraid if i don't figure this out soon and we eventually get married she will always wonder what if and she does not want to subject me to a wife who isn't 100% sure\". She has told me many times this is not my fault at all and we are amazing together but just an inevitable fear in her mind that she needs to figure out. Recently she came to me and told me how much this guilt is affecting her and it isn't allowing her to give all of herself to me and she thought the only way to be sure of this was for us to break up and her to rely on herself for a while and then if we are truly meant to be together (which we both believe) then we will find each other again. She did repeatedly express that this is not because she wants to date other people or hook up with anyone else and if we broke up it would be a very long time before she could and i really do believe her, she just needs to be sure in her mind. She just desperately needs time on her own to rely on herself and become more sure in herself and that she truly wants to be with me forever. During this conversation i shared my opinions and thoughts of everything and we agreed not to actually break up but to rely on ourselves for a while and take a break until the end of this semester which is a little over two months while still being loyal to each other, but not really talking or relying on each other at all and she thinks this is actually a much better idea than breaking up and leaving it to fate. We both are willing to commit to this despite it being the hardest thing either of us have ever done but we really love each other and we want whats best for each other and we are willing to fight for that. I have shared with her all the reasons I know we are meant to be together and how i think one of the biggest signs is how we believe we are truly in love and are best friends and we are willing to go through something so tough in an effort to make it work and while she does see these things and believes in them she still is not completely sure if what she feels is just comfort or if its true. I have told her that i really want whats best for her and if she truly believes we need to break up in order for her to work this stuff out then i will respect that decision and let her go but she has expressed that she doesn't want to give up on what we have but she needs to find a way to be more sure in her decision to be with me so she can give all of herself to me like she believes i deserve and to help with the guilt of her thinking shes wasting my time.\n\nI also want to say we do not have a perfect relationship like i may have made it seem. We do argue and we do get annoyed at each other sometimes but we do deal with it in healthy ways and continue to love each other through these things.\n\nI really do believe we are as close to perfect for each other despite not really believing in \"the one\". i believe someone can become \"the one\" after a long time together and growing together but i really believe we could have an amazing future together and i don't want to lose that or leave it to fate based on something that equates us to star crossed lovers.\n\nTLDR\n\nMe (21M) and my girlfriend (20F) have been together for a year and a half and have been best friends for 4 years before that. We are truly in love and have an amazing relationship together and we both believe we could have an amazing future together, but she has only ever known my love and has a lot of guilt and fear building up around whether she is truly sure in our love or if it is just comfortable for her because she is afraid if she stays with me and doesn't figure this out there will always be a \"what if\" in her head and she does not want to subject me to a life with someone who isn't 100% sure in their relationship. We have decided to take a break for the next two and a half months to rely on ourselves to see if she can become more sure in herself while still being loyal to each other.\n\nI apologize if this post is confusing or seems like a spill of information there are just a lot of things going on inside my head right now and i am not the best at organizing all my thoughts into one post.\n\nI guess i am really just looking for opinions on the situation and any advice and know if our plan is something that could truly make things work or if there are any other ways to go about this or if we are doomed to break up. I would also be open to any advice on things to talk to her about this and if its possible to figure this out while still being in a relationship.",

We both mean the world to each other and share a lot of interests.\n\nIn the last month we haven't been able to meet each other because of reasons on both sides. This didn't do our relationship any good. We still called almost daily, both together and with mutual friends of us. A couple of days ago she asked if we could have a serious chat, and then proceded to tell me that she feels like we're not really romantic.\n\nI agreed with her, it's just something I'm bad at (perhaps because of my lack of experience). She then told me I needed to improve on that, by being more flirty, giving more compliments and stuff. I tried to do so, but yesterday she told me she doesn't see much improvement yet. We're meeting up again Tuesday next week and at that moment she'll decide if we're staying together, or if we're becoming friends.\n\nIn the end I'll never fully lose her, but I would love it to stay together. How can I improve with being flirty, more romantic, etc? This goes for both over text, and in real life. I want to prove to her this coming week that I can be romantic, and ultimately have a romantic Tuesday next week so that we stay together.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: My partner wants me to be more romantic, but I don't really know how to improve outside what I'm already doing.",

They were together for six years, lived together for multiple, adopted dogs together, he even paid for part of her college tuition. I’m not blind to the fact that they experienced many things together and she was a huge part of his life, it’s honestly inevitable that she’s going to be brought up from time to time and I can accept that. At the start of our relationship he was very hesitant to talk about her, but eventually he opened up and gave me the details of the breakup as well as some of the issues they had leading up to it. Lately he’s been bringing her up very frequently, nearly every time we see each other. It usually happens during casual conversation, what we’re discussing will somehow relate to her or an experience they shared together and he’ll mention it. At first I didn’t think much of it but now I find it’s starting to weigh on me a bit. I genuinely don’t believe he’s sneaking around with her behind my back or anything of that sort, I’m just sick of hearing about her. I’m very conflicted about going to him about this, I want him to feel comfortable sharing all parts of his life with me and am afraid this may lead to him shutting me out. I truly don’t know if I’m just being dramatic or if this is an issue that’s worth bringing up.\n\nTL;DR - my boyfriend continuously brings up his ex in random day to day conversations",

        "text": "\nMy gf 18F (let's call her Mel) dissociates constantly. Mel and I met back in mid December of 2021. We immediately clicked and a mutual friend set us up, a few weeks later we were dating. We got together in January of 2022 and lasted until March of 2022.During those months of the first time we dated things were good up until just after Valentine's Day. After that point, I started to notice she often dissociated and would become distant. There was times she wouldn't talk to me for an entire day. I tried to be understanding because as someone that has mental issues, I understand it's not easy. Mel would still hangout with me after school despite being in on of her episodes, and one time I was trying to get her attention and she wouldn't acknowledge me (this was a week before we broke up) and she got fed up with me. Mel yelled at me \"what the fuck is the wrong with you\" and dug her nails into my arm and ripped my skin. I'm still not sure if I was to blame for this, but I walked out and cried sitting on the curb while waiting for my mom to pick me. The next week, she ignored me for three days and then broke up with me.This hurt as I loved her and I still do. While breaking up with me, Mel said \"I can't have another him.\" She compared me to someone else and that alone was enough to break my heart. After the breakup I spiraled and was later diagnosed with BPD. Months went by and the pain dissolved but I never lost feelings for her. Fast forward to Christmas Eve 2022, she texts me and I decide to text back. The conversations were causal and I didn't know she still had feelings until New Years' Eve. We weren't in person together but we were texting. Mel and I were both high as it got closer to 2023 and while not being sober, the conversation swayed and we ended up confessing to each other that night. We decided to not be officially together since we wanted it to to work. A few weeks later, we both started to regret deciding to take it slow so I asked her to be my gf on January 17th. Things were great up until recently. I've started to notice the dissociation is occurring more and more again. It feels like the the same pattern as last time. Despite this, she has been a much better gf than the first time. I told Mel that I've been diagnosed with BPD. She actively tries to help me through my episodes and insecurities. When she isn't dissociating she's an amazing gf, but when she is it feels like I'm talking to a stranger. Whenever we aren't together in person she likes to get high a lot (I only smoked that one night with my friend. In a way it feels like she's chosen weed over me. She claims she loves me but but it doesn't feel like it most of the time. I know my personality disorder heavily affects my judgement so I really don't know what to do. Mel and I got together the first time when we were both 16 and I I really love this girl and she says she feels the same, but I can't help but feel I'm wasting my teenage years on a relationship that is harmful to my well-being. What do I do?\n\nTldr - my gf has a dissociative disorder and I don’t know how to manage it",

        "text": "I (37m) began dating 34f last Summer into the Fall. Very early in our relationship we were talking about relationship goals, and she shared that she is strongly feeling her biological clock ticking and is looking to waste no time moving towards children and marriage. \n\nI voiced that I want the same thing, but that in my recent search I’ve dove too fast into what turned out to be some bad situations, and for that reason and my personal self-care I want to take things a little slow. At the time she understood.\n\nThe relationship moved forward and feelings grew, but in mid-November she came to me in tears saying that she didn’t think commitment was developing fast enough for her timelines. I had not fully voiced the growing depth of my feelings nor asked for exclusivity. And that concerned her. We got in a big fight because I really felt I was showing (if not saying) my growing feelings, and I really thought things were progressing at a normal healthy rate. We broke up.\n\nA month or so went by, Christmas rolled around, and we started exchanging warm holiday well wishes. I got an affectionate ‘Happy New Year’ message from her (at midnight). And shortly into the new year I decided to just reach out and ask to have coffee. She warmly said yes.\n\nObvious feelings emerged in our coffee date, and the next weekend she asked me out for another coffee. Later the Sunday evening of our second coffee date, she showed up at my door unannounced and we emotionally collided and agreed we should get back together. We have been together again since that time in mid-January.\n\nNow My Problem…I’ve learned that in the days before our break up in November, she had taken a first date with another guy. Him and her progressed quickly and within a month were mutually exclusive, sleeping together, and even sat down to dinner with her parents (something we have yet to do). I found out she was still with him the week of our January reconnecting coffee dates, and found out she hosted him for dinner and slept with him the night before we decided to get back together (she broke up with him over text earlier that day). \n\nShe insists: the first date back in November was with some reluctance, and that she did no wrong anyways because we were not exclusive. She further said that though things appear to have moved quickly, the underlying feelings were meaningless compared to what she now feels for me. And on the backend, she claims that she reluctantly went through the motions with him while feeling highly conflicted as feelings redeveloped with me, and also that she did her diligence in terms of safe sex, etc. (one of my many concerns given the quick turnaround on intimacy). \n\nI’m really uncomfortable with the timeline and events of this intervening relationship. I believe what she says she feels about me now, and know that she never violated any “exclusivity laws“ with me. But given how laser focused she is on family goals, and given her ability to so seamlessly pivot between two guys in such a short time…I’m having a really hard time trusting the authenticity and endurance of what we now have. I don’t know how special to feel that we are. \n\nI don’t know how much physical, emotional, and chronological space I should reasonably have expected between me and the last guy, for this to feel healthy. I’m considering asking for a break to let that other relationship drift further into the rearview. Any suggestions on how to determine if more space is needed? \n\n**TL/DR** A very happy relationship between me (37m) and 34f developed in the Fall but ended due to fears about commitment rate, given her extreme worries about biological clock and motherhood. We reconnected in January after about 9 weeks apart, and now say we love each other very much. But I learned she had a very involved relationship that lasted the entirety of the interlude, almost down to the hour. Very uncomfortable with the haste, depth, and seamlessness that she was able to pivot from me to him then back to me.",

There is one in particular that she mentions more than the others because he is the one who has carried out her training and she shadows him while at work when she first started.\n\nA few weeks ago she mentioned that a couple of people at work joked that her and the other guy would make a good couple. He is also in a relationship. According to my gf she just laughed it off but then it got mentioned a few more times. I know she has messaged him outside of work a few times since I've seen his name pop up on her phone.\n\nAfter she had mentioned that people at work had made the comments again I asked her how close they were at work.

I mentioned that it just seems strange that these are ongoing comments. She accused me of not trusting her but I just said they must be a reason that her colleagues keep saying they'd make a good couple and I was just curious why they make the comments and curious how her and the other guy act together when at work.\n\nShe just said they're only colleagues and that I know she'd never cheat. Does anyone have any advice on how to handle the situation?\n\ntl;dr my gf's colleagues repeatedly joke about how her and a male colleague would be a good couple but my gf doesn't seem to be actively telling them to stop. She got annoyed when I questioned how close she was to the colleague and she said they're only colleagues. Does anyone have any advice?",

        "text": "TL;DR - I don't think marriage improves relationships in today's day and age considering women's independence.\n\nTo me (29M) it seems like there’s not much to gain by marrying vs staying in a committed relationship, and you only expose yourself to the financial risk posed in a divorce when fighting for assets, alimony, etc. so why bother? I understand there are some tax and civil benefits, but, again, is it worth exposing yourself to all the risk?\n\nWomen are fairly independent now a days, so they don’t necessarily need the security of one man in particular. My understanding of marriage was that it was a good way to lock in a man from leaving the women, since she was an economic dependent, but this is no longer the case.\n\nI’m not in a serious relationship, but I’ve been thinking what I’m looking for as I would like to settle down soon in my mid-30s.\n\nInterested in hearing any anecdotes on how your marriage improved your relationship (or not), what your thought process of marrying is, whether you think it's worth the hassle, or if you think I might be missing something.",

        "text": "I know this is incorrect but the reason I’m so obsessive over bigotry is because I feel like it’s a mystery to solve rather than just the default state for a lot of people. I keep fooling myself into believing that hate is some labyrinthine puzzle that - if I just think about it hard enough - one day I’ll be able to solve it, and once I solve it, bigotry will cease to exist forever and I can finally stop hating myself.\n\nI know the truth: that the things that cause people to hate were set in motion far before birth, that some people plainly have an innate desire to hate others or feel superior no matter the conditions of the world we live in (the Gilbert Gottfried dentist episode of the Fairly Odd Parents first taught me that and it was a pill I refused to swallow for years; this shit goes back to my childhood), and there is absolutely nothing I can do to change that. Nothing. Not a damn thing. I also know that continuing to obsess over it (it is an unhealthy obsession I cannot deny that)only serves to my detriment. That the reason I hate myself isn’t because of other people but because I am actively choosing to hate myself, that for some reason I view my self-worth based on how other people value me.\n\nTruthfully, I feel like I don’t deserve to love myself for as long as hate exists. Why? I’m still not entirely sure. I think it’s because I see bigotry existing as my problem to solve, and I am a failure for not getting rid of hate by now. I know there’s a level of covert narcissism to this way of thinking; oh I’m a special one who can solve the world’s problems? Give me a break. I don’t think I’m a full-blown narcissist but I do think I embody a lot of the narcissistic tendencies most late Millennials have.\n\nI know this kind of obsessive and negative thinking actually does require a mental health professional, especially in light of the fact that I simply feel unable to stop obsessing over this. But I feel like seeking help for my obsession with homophobic people is giving up, and I don’t give up on anything or anyone, ever, period.\n\nI have quite literally put up with (legitimate) emotional and verbal abuse with past relationships until they left me, that’s how much I refuse to give up on people. One of my exes, after his mom died, took his anger out on me and told me he hopes my mom dies too so I could finally know how it feels. I still didn’t leave him. If I give up and admit that some people will always be hateful no matter what, it feels like I’m admitting defeat and that I’m weak.\n\nSo I’m still apprehensive about seeking professional help because I don’t want to give up. Maybe if I just think about it a little harder, everything will be alright and I’ll never have problems again.\n\n**TL;DR I have an unhealthy obsession with trying to change bigots but I refuse to stop because I don’t give up on people, even at the expense of my health and well-being because giving up is for the weak.**",

I'm not inept at carrying a conversation by any means, but I struggle with sharing I guess. So for instance, a \"how was your day?\" Could be something like, \"it was okay! I had a good day.\"\nBut I know it should be more like, \"it was good, I had a good day. Insert things that happened today.\" \n\nI'm hating on myself for throwing this away. He was very nice and said that I'm unhealthy for him. (The relationship with me is unhealthy). Because I'm not meeting his needs. He wanted to be there for me (something that hasn't really ever been offered before) and I didn't go to him. \nI even pathetically asked him if we could still be friends. He said emotionally, that wasn't healthy for him. \nHe also pointed out that I was asking for me, not him. \nMaybe I was. I'm not sure. I enjoyed him a lot. I guess I was already envisioning a future. I was super excited to meet him. And every time my phone dinged, I'd get excited. \nBut I didn't communicate well enough. And honestly, that makes me feel awful for him. \nI feel lonely. Empty even. Which is, full circle, probably how I made him feel. \nI don't think he will ever speak to me again... but if he would, (I know.... pipe dream.) what are some ways I can ensure that im sharing enough, but not too much? And just talking about life in general. Do you just text your partner what you're thinking? Or like, if I see something that I think is funny just send a pic in the middle of the day? \nI'm a little nervous that my rambling will scare ppl away. Or what I share will seem pointless? \n\nI'm not used to a partner wanting to know how I feel in depth. \nMy life is so lonely, and yet, I'm the reason it's that way because I let my past experiences dictate how high my walls are.\nMost men only want me for one thing... and he hardly mentioned that. Which was so nice. I really messed up. \n\nI wish I could text him a million random things right now. But I think he's probably blocked me on every platform. And I promised him I wouldn't be clingy, or needy, or crazy if we broke it off. \nIf he does reach out, what are things I can do to save this? How can I share more without worrying about oversharing? \nShould I get in the mind set of making my partner happy with all the talking? \nI want him happy. I just wish I could have been better when I still had him.",

We exchanged numbers and talked in the phone for a long time. We had our first date this past Friday and honestly it was probably the best first date I’ve had in my life. And she said it was her first date ever. She had just gotten out of a 4 year relationship(her first adult relationship) in December but told me the guy didn’t really believe in “going out for dates” so she really appreciated it. She said that it went really good for her too and said how nice and handsome I am which still trips me up because I’ve always had low self esteem. \n\nThe thing is her and her ex had an apartment together and when they broke up she just found another place but they still had the lease so now she’s paying on two places, she has some stuff still at the old apartment so she’s there periodically and they also own a business together although she did say she just might be taking the whole thing over. She told me from the jump that she’s really not big on texting and prefers to talk on the phone, plus she works late hours sometimes. I’ve always been into self sabotage so whenever she doesn’t text back I’m always thinking did I say something or do something wrong, is she thinking of getting back with her ex or does she just not want to talk to me anymore. I also don’t want to call out of the blue in case it’s an inconvenient time\n\nA couple things that help calm me down is she told me that I seem like a great guy to meet her parents and she already has future date ideas planned. Both our schedules have been really weird this week but I’m off starting tomorrow and don’t go back to work until Monday so I was thinking asking her to go to a candle making class and a vegan restaurant. \n\nI just don’t know what do do because she seems perfect and I don’t want to mess this up because if I do I’ll never forgive myself \n\nTLDR: I have anxiety about a girl who’s a perfect match and I don’t want to mess it up",

The job is located in a different town to where I live so I need to get 1 or 2 trains to get to work. I live in the UK and the trains are becoming more unreliable by the week with more and more getting cancelled.\n\nThis has led to me being late a few times to work due to needing to wait for the next available train which is normally either 30 mins or an hour. A co-worker who started the same time as me said she'd be happy to give me a ride to work since we live in the same town. She said all I need to do is get to the town centre and she'll pick me up from there. This has meant I'm not late to work and it's been great not worrying about public transport. It's also been nice to get to know a co-worker which can be difficult when work is primarily work from home.\n\nMy gf seemed fine initially with me getting a ride to work from my co-worker but at the weekend she said she wanted to talk and said she'd like me to stop getting a ride to work from my co-worker. I asked why and she just said it makes her uncomfortable me spending that much time alone with her. I pointed out my gfs co-workers drive her home from work but she said its different since they're the same gender. I mentioned that me getting rides meant I was no longer late to work, I never had to worry about public transport, I'm saving money and that I have more free time on an evening. She said she understands the benefits but she'd like me to stop. I refused and this week have gotten a ride to work both days that I need to be in the office.\n\nMy gf is saying I have completely disregarded her opinion and disrespected her since she expressed her discomfort. Does anyone have any advice on how to handle the situation?\n\ntl;dr my gf doesn't like that a female co-worker gives me a ride to work and is angry that I have refused to stop getting the ride to work.

Thats not the case I just thought since she had this  huge influx of cash, no debt since her parents paid her college, and I have a lot of debt, it seemed fair for this one roughly 3-3.5k expense to be split evenly. \n\nMy friends have said I should break things off with her. They thought she was taking advantage of me before this sicne she wanted a nicer palce than I really required to begin with and Ive been essentially subsidizing her lifestyle for the year we've lived together, they said the fact taht she doesnt want to be generous is a huge red flag. I feel like I cant think straight since all this has happened in the last 5 days. I just need some advice. The other sub post got me a lot of hateful DMs and also people calling my partner things I dont like either, I hope this one can be more civil. \n\nTLDR: Partner inherited 400k, yet attacked me when I suggested splitting a common expense evenly because my salary is higher. Im getting mixed feedback and would like some help.",

        "text": "Let me start by saying that I (f19) love my family, they have always been there for me and I really appreciate them in my life. However, one thing that has always bothered me is the favouritism they show towards my sister (f23).\n\nFirst of all, I live in Asia so living with our parents after 18 is very common. Me and my sister both live with our parents. I am a student while my sister runs a small business from home. Although we get along really well, me and my sister have completely different personalities. She's very introverted and obedient, I on the other end, am an extrovert and rebellious.\n\nI think might be the reason behind favouritism. Mom has never been obvious with it but it's still pretty noticable and dad just straight out does it on my face. To narrate some instances, I am always expected to do house chores while studying for 8 hours a day and working part time. On top of it, even a slightest mistake can make my dad lose his temper and he would scold me.\n\nI have never seen this behaviour with my sister. She is engaged and plans to be a full-time housewife along with running her business, which is something she only does 2-3 hours a day. She never does any household chores unless she's told to. She doesn't know basic cooking and is very picky about everything.\n\nEveryday I am scolded for the smallest things while my sister gets a pass everytime. This prejudice exists in my extended family too. For instance, years ago when my sister was preparing for her medical entrence but didn't pass, I was blamed for her low score. Everyone told me that she didn't pass because I was distracting her so she couldn't study.\n\nI have been subjected to these things all of my life, but still it hurts everytime. Even at school when I was once accused of stealing, no one believed me, but as soon as the teachers found out that I was my sister's little sister, they believed me. They thought her sister wouldn't do something like that. \n\nI have always heard that how my sister is the better, smarter and prettier of us two which I agree to. But why can't anyone appreciate me for being me?\n\nMy dad thinks everything I do is for attention. I cuty hair, for attention. I wear jeans, for attention. I cried, for attention. I was falsely accused of cheating, for attention. I am sick, for attention. I am just so tired of this. I've fought with him for this same reason but nothing changes.\n\nApart from this he has been a great dad. He was always there for our school functions, he tries to get to know my friends, we have deep conversations about career and future, he always makes me breakfast and takes care of all of our expenses.\nSame with my mom, she's the best mother ever. She's understanding, supportive and she's like a friend to me. \n\nThe only thing that bothers me is their favouritism.\n\nI don't blame my sister at all for this, she has been my best friend for all these years and I know that it's not her fault . \n\nI have severe anxiety for 8 years now and it keeps on getting worse. Only sister knows about it. I've had some bad thoughts too and tried some bad things and my parents behaviour is not helping at all. \n\nTL;DR! I am losing my patience over my parents'favouritism and I don't know what to do.",

        "text": "How do I moved on after being a rebound?\n\nTL; DR Need your opinions/advices\nOkay so i’m 26F and I met my ex boyfriend 22M in November 2022. We first know each other through our mutual friends in September but we never exchanged conversation until November. After that we talked and clicked quite fast despite the age difference. On December we went to Bali together with my friends. However we also fought a lot, he liked to compare me to his ex girlfriend and as a return sometimes I did that too. But I tried to compromise it. Until February 2023 while we were on the phone, I joked with him\n\nMe: bebe can you at least be sweet to me just for a day? (With a cute tone of course)\nHim: why are you so ungrateful? That’s why your ex boyfriend can’t exceed your expectation. If you want a sweet boyfriend just go back to your ex.\n\nThat caught me off guard and I was so confused and at that time my replied was Me: he was sweet to me?\nHim: oh okay so now you’re comparing me to your ex boyfriend. \nMe: No I didn’t \nHim: if I can compare you to my ex girlfriend, she is only 22 and she knows what she wants to do in her life, she is set for life. Unlike you, you are 26 but you don’t know what to do. \n\nI was speechless I don’t know what to say, but during my time with him I was easily manipulated by him, so my response was, i’m sorry I didn’t mean to compare you with my ex boyfriend. I’ll do better yada yada yada and he told me to give him 5 days for him to make a decision. He was supposed to give me answer by Friday but he did not give me until Sunday. \n\nSo Sunday has come and during that my mother, father, and sisters have witnessed my bloated face due to crying everyday. I couldn’t face him so my sister told him to fuck off and if you really love my sister he wouldn’t mentioned his ex girlfriend all the time and told him to just go back to his ex girlfriend because one day he ever joked to me, “oh you have the same B car with my ex, but the difference is that you have B-RV (it’s Honda btw) and my ex is BMW.”\n\nOkay so fast forward after my sister argued with him, I came to interfere and he said\n“If only your sister didn’t interfere we would likely go back together, but that chance has already been shattered so now we can’t” \n\nA month after that accident and turns out 2 weeks after that day, he decided to go back to his ex girlfriend when he told me he wouldn’t get back together. \n\nHowever during that 2 weeks, I didn’t know. So I kept chasing him (I know i’m stupid like that). He told me we couldn’t be together because I think there’s something wrong with him, he might need to go to a psychologist, he can’t be with anyone. Yada yada yada. And after we broke up we went out, he gave me a Valentine’s day gift and told me just to be casual with him. \n\nNow I still miss him it hurts. I still cries out of the blue, I love him genuinely, but knowing i’m the only who hurt, hurts me more. Knowing i’m the rebound just making me question my self worth. Am I good enough? Not only for him, but for anyone?\n\nI think it’s really a crime to play with someone’s else’s feelings you know. Now he already got back together with his ex, but i’m in pain alone. I just want him to realized one day, what he did to me was wrong. But sometimes I hate myself too, I mean he hurt me but why I still do have feelings for him? When I have good or bad news, he’s the first person to pop up in my mind and it drives me crazy 😭\n\nOh and by the way he blocked my tiktok (because I made videos about him) and my whatsapp. I guess his girlfriend asked him? Because before that one of her friend visited my tiktok. \n\nUp until now this question just gonna be on my mind, do you ever loved me during those 3 months? Hahaha \n\nGod it hurts so much 😭\nHave you guys ever experiences of being a rebound? And how do you cope with it?\n\nBrief summary: I was in a relationship for 3 months and he called it a quit, after 2 weeks he is dating his ex girlfriend before me. What do I do?",

        "text": "Howdy!\nI casualily saw a guy (let's call him Steve) for about 5 months. The first 2 were great - Steve was super into me, he told me he liked me after the first date. We made plans together, he messaged me back almost instantly whenever I messaged him, he listened to me without interruption, *he was a good lover.* He would even jokingly refer to me as a goddess and hinted that he wanted to invite me to his family trip for Christmas!\n\nAt some point however, the dynamic changed. Steve stopped replying, initiating and generally showing interest. Despite this, We'd meet up after I chased him to make time for me. I was in denial of the fact that it was over romantically. When I reached breaking point, I messaged him about my feelings and asked whether he wanted to keep seeing me or not - the answer was no (he replied very quickly to this message, funnily enough). It was a hard no, but to his credit, he apologised and admitted he should have communicated better and earlier. \n\n\nAfter the \"break up\" I've had a multitude of sources telling me different things about what went wrong. One friend said Steve was love bombing me in the beginning and then breadcrumbed me when he lost interest. Another friend said Steve was insecure and that made him come on too strong. Several tik tok reels have implied that I am both avoidant and anxious in my attachment styles. I now recognise that I've never probably seen a healthy relationship role model in my life, so what is within the range of \"normal\"? If you go out on a first date with someone and you had a good time for example, what would be normal to do? How much messaging is too much? I feel absolutely baffled by all of it.\n\n**TLDR;** I recently got rejected and I'm now questioning what a healthy dating relationship even looks like.",

He is the best partner I've ever had - very loving, very attentive, very emotionally intelligent.\n\nFor context we both met as single parents. He has 3yo boy-girl twins and I have a 2yo son. Naturally because my first family already broke up, I am extra hesitant if I were to ever have another child. I'd want to stay with the father for good - at least until the kid is an adult. I love my boyfriend but we're still in the honeymoon stage, it is still early to me.\n\nWhenever we're out and he sees baby clothes he will lead me over to them to \"have a look\". He will pick up cute newborn clothes and say things like \"isn't this too cute?\"\nIt's just, why?\n\nI'm not sure why I'm posting here, I guess I want to ask if this is normal for this stage in a relationship and I want to get insight from others. Everything else is perfect, it's just this thing that baffles me and makes me question his sanity. Or maybe I'm the problem, i'm not sure.\n\nTL;DR is it normal for someone to go pretend baby window shopping this early on in a relationship (6 months)?",

        "text": "Hi guys.\n\nSo my boyfriend and I just got into an argument while my younger cousin and nephew were home. Long story short we got into a heated argument in which he was yelling at me loudly while they were present, which I felt was inappropriate. I told him to “get the fuck out” which I admit was not the best use of the words because I only meant that he should take a walk so that we could both have time to cool down. However he started to pack his bags to leave which isn’t what I wanted but again like I said I didn’t handle the situation well or word my want for him to take a walk well. When he started to walk past me with his stuff I did shove him to try to keep him in the room so we could talk which I know was wrong and I have apologized for 1000x over already. However he became extremely angry and told me if I put my hands on him again that he would “beat the brakes off of me” very loudly while my nephew and cousin were present. I know I shouldn’t have shoved him at all and I apologized so many times but I’m still so in shock at the fact that he said that. I didn’t shove him aggressively or cause any pain and he is over 100 pounds heavier than I am. I know I was wrong in shoving him, I just still don’t think him yelling at me that he was going to “beat the fuck out of me” (which he also said later in addition to “brakes”) was an okay response to that. Please I just need an outside opinion on this. He is currently on the walk to try to calm down and I don’t know what to do.\n\nTLDR: I shoved my boyfriend in an argument to try to stop him from walking past me and he told me he’d beat the fuck out of me or beat the brakes off me if I touched him again. Not sure if I’m in the wrong here or what I should do.",
