It is so adaptable and fluid.\n\n(I'm sure it's got nothing at all to do with colonization and trade)\n\n&gt;but the rules of English change over time\n\nNo other language does?\n\n&gt;Also English has amalgamated a lot of foreign words into its lexicon\n\nI guess only English does this?\n\n&gt;When you correct someone's grammar or say something like \"that's not a word!\" does that mean you are stifling the organic growth of language?\n\nDepends on the context. Generally speaking the answer is probably yes.\n\n&gt;You aren't entitled to make new changes, languages just evolve. \n\nHow does this person think languages evolve?\n\n&gt;As a side to this though, the 5 romance languages are all basically just bad Latin,\n\nHuge over-simplification. I get what this person is trying to say though. \n\n&gt;I don't know about the changes in French from the High Middle Ages to modern times, but only the aristocracy in England would have been able to speak French\n\nThere were no laws restricting who spoke French after the Norman conquest, so why would only the aristocracy be able to speak French?\n\nThese were all under the top level comment, which itself is actually pretty good. I'm sure there's plenty more badling in the rest of the follow-up comments, but I don't care enough to find it. ",
