The last such sign was a branch from a flower he gave my mother, which suddenly fell off somehow on All Saints' Day. About a year ago I also had a lucid dream  in which I felt that someone was in my room, knocking on the glass and the fact that the dog ran to the front door. I will write the rest of the story in a comment. \nDoes he want to communicate something to me? The last time I visited his grave was in March",

I have very severe arachnophobia and saw a wolf spider in my room so naturally, I did not sleep in my room for a month and instead, I slept in the living room. \n\nOne day in about late July this year I was having trouble sleeping, so I was on my phone in the living room about to go to sleep. It was around midnight. I heard a sound that sounded like someone had ran into the bookshelf behind me. I turned to see a short outline of a glowing person. Me being a scaredy-cat decided to hide under my blanket, repeatedly yelling, go away, go away, go away. The next day I told my grandma (who I live with) what I had saw the night prior. My grandma is Christian but still believes in spirits, so I didn’t know exactly if she would believe me. She asked me a few more questions but didn’t really seem that interested. I went to go sit down in the living room after the conversation and then she came running in and asked me again if it was last night I told her yeah, a little bit before midnight. To which she starts crying telling me yesterday was seven years to the day. My mamaw (her mom) had died. Which I started crying as well.\n\nI’ve always felt the presence of spirits in my house since I was three I even remember one day a spirit trapping me in my room.  (I can tell that story if anyone wants but I was little and don’t remember a lot of details.) I’ve also always had severe déjà vu and some sleep paralysis, as well as lucid dreaming, but I cut off my lucid dreaming as soon as it happens as it’s a fear of mine. For about a month after that I would see her around the house every once in a while but I haven’t seen her in a really long time. I do often still feel eyes on me but if I ignore them for long enough or say go away they normally do.",

I had one with a trickster spirit. Which we did get rid of that very day by giving it to a person who openly accepts them. \nI only got to meet around 50 of the dolls which many of them are haunted with humans and non human spirits. \n\nI just want to know how to not be afraid of the new dolls that come in that are occupied by a spirit. Cause man it’s hard to sleep not knowing what they will do.  I just want some advice on how to not be scared of them. Cause I love them unconditionally and want them to be happy here without feeling guilty of me being scared of them for merely existing!\n\nI’m also torn on if I should open myself up to them to communicate with them. Which would also invite bad spirits in my life which man I can’t let happen due to being a Christian and living in an extreme Christian household where they view every ghost as a “demon”.  It is just something I am torn about.\nI value my Christian family’s values to a degree and not want to upset them but I also want to communicate with the spirits I am taking up space with in my room. \nMan this is probs a vent. I just want someone’s opinion on my situation and what they would do, and how to not fear the spirits in my room at night!",

        "text": "Now for this section of my life, I decided to put my experiences down in the paranormal sub reddit, as I didnt actually see a shadow in this next instance.\n\nI was 13 years old and had a friend over for a sleepover. We fell asleep listening to creepy pastas in my room with the door locked and left my friends tablet charging in the kitchen. When we woke up, my friends stuff was covered in wax drippings. No one could have gotten in with the door locked and I didnt have candles in my room at the time. When I opened my bedroom door, there was a trail of wax drips leading from my room to the kitchen. I followed them. The trail ended all over my friends tablet. She didnt like sleeping over after that. \n\nBetween then and this next story, there was always strange noises wherever I would sleep at 3 am. Not any that were alarming enough to put much detail into, just the occasional 3 knocks on the wall above my head, or cupboards slamming open and shut in the kitchen.\n\nAt the age of 15, I was getting ready for bed just as it was beginning to get dark. By the time I turned off the lights and walked to my bed, it was almost completely dark besides the light from the kitchen spilling dimly into my room. I sat on my bed and noticed something black on the floor right by my foot. (my carpet was white)I assumed it was just a sweater I had thrown and forgotten to pick up, until it started to move. Instinctively I called my dogs name, and automatically heard her paws clicking down the hallway. The reality hit me that something was in my room and it wasn't my dog. But what was it? It continued to move around as I strained to adjust my eyes to the dark. And then it began to grow. It grew right in front of my eyes to the largest dog/wolf like figure I've ever seen. It was a huge black shadow that I couldn't look away from. I froze while staring at it less than a few inches from me. It shape shifted from a dog/wolf thing into a tall shadow man and almost as quickly as it started, it left my sight, walking through the wall and disappearing into the night.",

        "text": "So this was a very weird experience I had with my girlfriend as we were walking our dog around the block a couple of months ago. I remember it very vividly though and we have talked about it several times without understanding what we saw.\n\nOur dog did NOT want to go down this street he was being very strange but he hadn't gone poop yet so we pressed on around the corner of the street. Almost the second we got around the corner it started. I sensed or heard something and was actually looking backward (bad senses apparently) So I missed the initial view but saw plenty. The strangest thing about this was it was SILENT outside. We live just outside a major city, it comes off as suburb-ey but two roads down are loud drug filled streets. So my girlfriend makes a startled noise and I turn my head back. It's dark with few street lights, but we see what we assume is a coyote, too tall for a dog and scraggly (don't worry it gets weirder) the coyote has a cat by the throat. We startled and interrupted what was happening. The cat bolts right, again ZERO noise, no squeals, no hiss nothing. The dog/coyote walks away from us down the street in the direction we would be heading. I can see him \"prance\" down the road but never get a good look, he never ran or anything just a fast walk. Our dog was petrified during this by the way he never barked ran after or anything, he's a corgi and they bark constantly. He probably knew he was no match but that never stopped his barks...\n\nNow it gets really weird, this dog thing is walking away, not fast but enough I could catch up with a hustle. I had a gun on me and was more worried about the animals on my street than getting attacked or whatever so I speed walk down after it. As I am gaining on the animal I see it's approaching a man standing off to the side of the street (so out of light and only a shadow). Now this is where I get confused on what happened as I'm staring into the shadows of where the man and dog thing were. I could tell the animal was not frightened of the man, so in my head, I'm thinking like wtf is that this guy's pet and just wanted to ask what it was. He sees me hustling toward him and obviously in the direction of where his pet was. But the man turns and hustles down the street away from me and I don't really remember seeing the dog with him, but they ABSOLUTELY crossed paths right there.\n\nMy initial guess was again coyote but potentially even being kept as a pet by this guy. Which is crazy, yes but they went in the direction of where there is basically a homeless encampment on the side of the road with a couple RV's.. Transients do weird things so I could see that as a possibility. IDK maybe he just lets his dog thing eat neighborhood cats at night. But just the silence of it all and the man purposefully avoiding me was very eerie and something about when they both got to each other in the shadows didn't add up to me. Any guesses would be appreciated and if you think it was just a dog, hopefully, you at least enjoyed reading this story..",

He agrees and I follow him into the kitchen. As we turn the corner, a demon looking claw is attached to the corner of the wall, coming from the bathroom. It had sharp nails and looked evil. Keep in mind that it was very dark, so I couldn't see what it was attached to. That's if it was attached to anything at all... I look over at my dad and realize that I'm the only one who sees this.   \n\nBeing a Paranormal Investigator and after all my research of the Afterlife, it's a common occurrence for children to \"see things.\" They are open vessels, as are people nearing death.

        "text": "This story has been in my head for awhile so but it has also been over 5 years since this has happened but I will try my best to type this out.\n\nIt was 2015, I was 12 years old, in a suburban town in Pennsylvania. I lived on top of a cliff/hill (this part comes in later) and my neighbor at the time, we will call her Ann, was 11 and a grade under me. Now I was never close to my family so I never really knew the pain of losing a family member at this point but my neighbor had lost her grandmother at this point in time. She spent a couple of days with her family and once she came home she was still a mess. I, doing the only thing I knew how to do when people were upset, I found her as soon as she came home and hugged her. After this we hung out all and decided we wanted to hangout all night because, why not? Her brother was staying at his other friends house as his own coping mechanism so we took over his bedroom, with his permission, because he had a queen bed and so we could share a bed. I’ll skip over all the tween girl shit we did because its not important. Where the weird shit being is at around 12:00 am. We ended our night watching Southpark on her laptop. Ann fell asleep during the last episode we were watching. I finished the episode and put her laptop on the floor and just turned over to go to sleep. Now, this is where this gets really hard to explain so I am going to write what happened in list order of times:\n\n~12:00 am - I finish watching the Southpark episode and went to sleep\n\n~12:30 am - Ann stirs quite hard in bed\n\n~1:00-1:15 am - Ann stirs concerningly hard in her sleep top the point where I make sure she is okay and also starts to make weird noises. Like when a baby tried to learn to talk for the first time but just couldn't figure out how to make the words.\n\n~1:30 am - Ann stirs SO hard in her sleep she ends up laying with her head at my feet and her feet at my head and shes doing the weird mumble/growl thing even louder and it really doesn't sound like her\n\n~2:00 am - She continues stirring and making weird noises \n\n~2:30 am - She starts making the noises again and stirs more and more. She eventually sat up in bed and sat up completely straight, turned her head out towards the front of the bed. Her shoulders completely relax and she says, “But I didn’t mean to!” in tone that makes it sound like she was getting scolded. She lays down while swinging her legs completely straight out and aying down perfectly, as if someone was placing down a doll. I, freaking the fuck out, turned to look to see what she was looking at. When I turned I saw a figure of a woman that was just pure white, I didnt get a long enough look to be able to make out features but I saw something. Now this figure thing was not infront of a window, or mirror, any sort of light. The street lamps were not LED’s at this point, they were actually a yellow color. I also only go to see this figure for about half a second.\n\n2:37 am - (Yes i know the exact time) I pack my shit up and go home.\n\nAs I am going home I feel like I'm being stared at from all corners behind and infront of me as I walk on the road. I kept checking behind me and obviously there was nothing to the eye but I felt like there was. The house I lived in had a concrete slab walkway thing that led up to my front door. As I am walking up this walkway I hear what sounds like heavy boots walking behind me. I remember pausing and trying to let my brain figure out if its my steps or something else. As I walk faster so do the sounds of the steps behind me. Once I got to my door they stopped. \n\nThe next day, I told my neighbor about this and there was no explanation to this experience. My family and neighbors told me that I saw nothing, what I heard was her simply sleep talking even though she had no prior experience to it and also that her stirring was just normal. About 2 weeks after this happened I spoke about to Ann again and her exact sentence to bringing it up again was, “Oh yeah, it was my grandma. She visits me in my sleep now.”\n\nNow that that is kind of explained, lets get back to the feeling of being watched while crossing the road. This is also where the cliff I lived on comes in. Now if there are people who don’t know Pennsylvania is the state of coal and theres a lot of coal mining obviously. After the whole “seeing my friends dead grandma” ordeal we were sitting around the fire talking about why our parents decided to live where we lived. So we simply asked them, and one thing that really sticks our in teh conversation is the risk factor of living where we lived. Underneath all our house are old mining tunnels that could collapse at any minuet. There is not a lot of information on the story but I am pretty sure something happen and there was an accident or people got sick but something happened and it was not good. So that could feeling of being watched while walking, maybe there was just making sure I got home safe.\n\nI have never had an experience like that ever since that moment. I am now 18 and still can’t make sense of the situation and also no longer talk to Ann. It is like a weird unclosed chapter of my life. It leaves me curious to what can actually be out there. Was I a freaked out 12 year old kid with an overactive imagination or did I somehow tune into the other side that day? I will never go back to that area due to personal issues that are not the possibility of seeing ghosts walk the streets at 2:30 am but I also want to investigate somewhere just to see if maybe there is something. I sit on a teetering fence of what my stance on ghosts being real are. It's hard for me to put any logic on the argument due to that one night I decided to have a sleepover with my neighbor.",

I check and sure enough it’s a quarter. \nI’m sure there an explanation but I didn’t touch this machine and was standing there for 10 secs pouting before it dropped. Makes me wonder",

It was on all fours, it was pale and it had these arms that where as long as me, at least five feet, if not longer! And it's head...God I will never forget that head...that face! It had a head that was white, and shaped like some sort of snake, or crocodile...and those eyes, if you could even call them eyes glowed an eerie blue in the darkness. The thing stood up, me and my friend frozen in fear, and it was 8-10 feet tall, it was terrifying! It let out a screech that was freakier that it's face, and then it ran way. We stood in that spot for 2 minutes before blasting the  opposite way. As expected, none of our other friends believed us. Anybody know what it is? Or have you seen this thing yourself?",

        "text": "Alright that title sucks, but hear me out: So due to some unfortunate relationship developments I had to move back in to my parents house. Now coming from living in a new-ish apartment back to my old childhood house has been… interesting. It has a lot of good elements (spending more time with family, appreciating things more, remembering so much from my childhood) but also it has come with some share of challenges. One of the strange things I have noticed is how many SOUNDS an old house makes. Now I am a believer of the paranormal, so I suppose I am pre conditioned. However that being said, that is why I am super skeptical whenever something strange happens… Jump back to a few weeks ago, and I am home alone for the weekend. I started to notice a lot of bangs around the house and narrowed most of them down to the vents - whenever the heat in the house came on, but as I was sitting on the couch right above my head there was a HUGE bang that made me jump out of my seat. I went upstairs to check it out and of course nothing. Then, the next day when I was dozing off in bed I was startled because I heard a disembodied voice quite loudly say my name from outside my bedroom. I got up and looked around and no one was home. It was really weird, but I shook it off as dosing off or a dream. Now back to the present, a few days ago my mom and sister were hanging out in the kitchen, and a huge burst of air and then a cold presence lingered in the kitchen with them, they both noticed this and were sort of perturbed by it. And yesterday, my mom said she heard someone clearly whisper her name when no one else was home at the time. I never told her or anyone else about my strange experience. What should I do? Is it just coincidence and stress or something more? I hope it is not something sinister. We have had so many family members pass the last few years, I don’t have a lot of family left. Anyone have any ideas? \n\nThank you",

I am usually the only one who does that to him. So, yesterday during the shift, somebody choked his neck from the back. He said to it, \"stop it because it hurts\".  He then went to my workstation/desk and asked my seatmate if she saw me. My seatmate said that maybe I went to the restroom or something. Then last night at 10 pm (the time our shift ends), my friend chatted me if I was absent, to which I said yes.\n\nToday at work, I asked my friend for more details about the person or entity that choked his neck. He said the \"person\" was wearing almost the exact same blouse I am wearing now. It would be strange because why would I wear the same blouse in a row? Although I do have a few blouses with a similar design (long sleeves and silky). I told him maybe it was his other friends from work, but he said it couldn't be because no one else would choke his neck other than me.\n\nOur office does have a history of horror stories from employees who could see ghosts. It has happened before with another employee. Let's just call her Jane. Jane is my friend too. So Jane was absent from work that day. Then an admin staff saw her or an entity that looks exactly like her. That entity just walked in front of the admin staff, smiled, then walked away. I don't know. Could this be a ***doppelganger*** perhaps?",

Mind you my aunt that lived with us was really into witchcraft and rituals that’s what my parents told me.\n\nOne day, my parents were recording me and my baby sis doing baby/toddler things. While there recording they hear a knock my dad thinking it’s my grandpa letting us know they are back home from going out. My dad opens the door and no one is home. He goes throughout the house and sees no one. He didn’t really take it serious. \n\nWeeks pass by my aunt and her cousin are home alone, usually when we come home from work they shout there home or knock. \nMy aunt and her cousin were reading some witchcraft books they just got. My grandparents never knew about the books because they weren’t allowed there. The house is old we have a old school heater in some of the rooms and it’s on the wall it’s tall. And between the heater you can see through the kitchen a little gap. She said they both heard a man breathing hard and the door handle moving shaking to open. They both yell “ WHOS THERE FRANK IS THAT YOU? SAM IS THAT YOU?” Nothing. They hear it again this time banging the door and breathing hard. They both run out like maniacs and run outside until some gang members ask them if there okay? My aunt ask if they can check the house a man is in there. They get back and told them no one is there. When my dad got there couple minutes he said they both looked pale white. \n\nAnother time my dad said he randomly woke up turned around and saw me in my crib talking to a man outside my window, laughing and talking. My dad in fear and anger that he gets up as fast runs outside trying to catch the man and as soon as he gets too my window no one was there. There is a big tall fence and there’s not a possibility he climbed that in 3 seconds or heard the fence. He gets back to the room and asks me who was I talking to and I said the a man in the window. He then changed my crib next to them. \nThese are just some stories they told me. I have more from our ranch in Mexico.",

Welp, maybe not because twice in the whole history I have been in this house I felt something poke me/ tap me. almost like in a playful, \"hay, look behind you\" kinda tap. Twice this happened while I was turning over in my bed at night. Both times have been in 2 different years, they weren't caused by sleep paralysis because I checked if I could move both my hands. I didn't dare turn around because I was scared.\n\nFlash Foward years later and I was in bed, I turn over, and I hear some clatter. I closed my eyes thinking it was another typical earthquake, I am just listening and trying to see how strong the quake will be this time, but as I listened more I wondered why my stuffed animals weren't falling off the shelves, they were absolutely not secure because I just renovated, and I then began to pinpoint the sound. I know how earthquakes sound and they are loud and this didn't sound like the whole room was moving. Then, as soon as I realized the room wasn't moving, it was the fucking ped posts! I try to get up and then the fucking wind hits my face. My bed moved a couple of inches to the right so fast that I felt like I was on a roller coaster. I get up and noped out of the room. Nothing has happened in 2 years after that. Also, I checked for 2 days straight the earthquake reports in the area and nothing popped up, that push was so strong everyone in the house should have been alerted but nothing. \n\nNow, I am wondering if it's escalating every couple of years, could that be possible? I am renovating again and I am nervous.",

One of the dogs would only go in our backyard.\n\nOne of my family members opened the back door and immediately the dog became aggressive, a dog that had never shown agression before or after this night. Just as fast as she became aggressive, she became scared and ran back inside.\n\nI had just kicked my boots off after wearing them all day and was about to change out of my jeans when this happened. I quickly put my boots back on, grab a flashlight and a large club I had recently made. I book it out to the back of our house and just stop dead in my tracks.\n\nI don't see anything, I don't hear anything, but, something was there. I could feel the presence of pure evil.\n\nThen I see a shadow moving and it's huge. \n\nThis shadow was easily 8 feet tall, vaguely humanoid but had these massive antlers\n\nNormally my flashlight is able to illuminate everything pretty well, tonight I couldn't even see my hand in front of my face.

The figure looks at the club and looks back into my eyes before slowly nodding its head up and down a few times.\n\nI see my flashlight turn off in my peripheral vision. I look at it and it turns back on, this time illuminating the entirety of the property.\n\nI quickly turn my focus back to the figure only for the figure to be gone.\n\nWhat was lifetimes to me was no more than a minute in reality.",

The long term care unit at the largest hospital in our county is haunted and everyone knows it. \n\n It was a psychology ward in the 90's, but unless you're in the know you wouldn't be able to tell after two refurbishments. The rooms are larger than most rooms in the hospital with amenities that are specifically made for long term care. Pretty nice unit... \n\n Well, it has an extremely high turnover rate especially on nights and patients complain until they are transferred. Some even say they'd rather die than stay. Many patients just say they get an overwhelming sense of dread and fear when they get there. Complaints of nightmares, feeling watched, and claims of strange children coming into their room late at night despite no children on the unit. \n\n The most common claim is seeing a nurse dressed in the old outfit in the garden from the window or waking them up to ask if they are okay before leaving without explanation. \n\n The unit was closed in 1994 due to a nurse being murdered by a young patient suffering from psychosis, he didn't need weapons just brute force. She has a memorial in the garden outside, many patients say she is the one to wake them. \n\n I don't go there often, but there is always an incident when I do. Today was no different. A patient in a good mood who was excited to have more space and better care for her lengthy recovery from her recent battle with cancer (now cancer free) suddenly started having a panic attack the moment we got onto the unit. She just kept saying \"I'm gonna die here!\" over and over. We eventually got her to settle down, but arrangements were already being made to find another facility.",

It was dark out so I grabbed a flashlight, delivered the mail like a good neighbor, and meandered my way back to my house.\n\nI walked up the steps and saw a set of wet footprints leading toward my front door as if someone had walked into my house. I stopped and stared, at first, I panicked thinking someone had gone into my house while I was gone, but I realized that the footprints I saw matched the bottoms of the boots I was wearing exactly. Logically they would have been made by me however, in the past several hours, I had only gone *out* the door *once*. There was no possibility that I could have left those footprints, they weren't there when I had left the house to deliver the mail either.\n\nI tried to shrug it off but as I went to unlock the front door it wouldn't budge. I could hear it unlocking but the handle wouldn't turn at all and it honestly felt like it was being held shut from inside the house. When I finally managed to force the door open there was nothing there, just an empty house. The door has never stuck like that the entire time my family has lived here and the ghost that haunts our house hasn't done stuff like that before.  They tend to stay in the main bedroom where they make lots of noise and the occasional shadow figure.\n\nSo if it wasn't me and it wasn't the ghost, what could have left footprints like that?",

        "text": "I’m not sure if this belongs in this sub or not but, hello! Today I was talking to one of my friends about paranormal experiences that we’ve had and it made me remember something that happened to me.\nWhen I was 16, I lived in a small apartment complex at the outskirts of our town. The way the complex was set up was a little street with rows of apartments on either side and a dumpster at the end of the street that all the residents shared. One night I was asked by my mother to take some trash out to the dumpsters, just a pretty normal chore. For context, I live in the Southwest US and the specific area where these apartments were is pretty rural. Behind the dumpster is a rock wall, then just desert and mountains. It’s literally just the very quiet apartments and cacti as far as the eye can see, so I felt pretty safe taking the trash at night. I walked all the way to the end of the street with my little trash bag and as I’m throwing it in the dumpster, I swore I could hear something on the other side of the wall. I could hear my mother’s voice going “hey!” and “come here!” from the other side of the wall clear as day. It was unmistakably my mom’s voice, but she was all the way at the end of the street in our apartment. I couldn’t see whatever was on the other side of the wall, but I knew it was NOT my mom. My fight or flight was immediately kicking in, and I made a beeline back home and I didn’t dare look behind me as I ran. I was so scared that I had even taken my chanclas off and left them in the street so I wouldn’t fall. \nI still can’t make any sense of what happened. I’m a pretty skeptical person when it comes to the paranormal, but I don’t think I’ve ever felt fear like that before or since then. \n\nTL;DR something was impersonating my mom and I freaked out because I knew my mom was actually at home",

It’s not sleep paralysis, because my usual reaction is to whip around and confront what was there. So I can clearly move But it’s always nothing. \nLast night, I had been smoking weed to fight alcohol cravings to some success. This happened at about 5am, well too late for me to still be severely intoxicated.\n  \nFirst I noticed that my mind whipped out of a typical nonsense dream suddenly to a state of focus, silence and clarity. Still asleepish, but not that previous state, but not a typical lucid dream either.\nI felt the feeling and instinctively whipped around. Went back to sleep. It started again. This time, I something in me just decided to… let it happen.\n\n\nI’m going to call the presence a she, because she spoke in a female voice – but almost inaudibly. She crawled on top of me, but in a matter that felt more like a lover getting in spooning position. I did not feel threatened. I suddenly felt very emotionally attached to her, and in fact she seemed almost in distress. She was whispering something about spirits and lives, and mentioned something about why cousin who committed suicide a few years ago. I pulled her closer and repeated that I couldn’t understand her, please I just wanted to understand her.\n\n\nSomething about this made me ask “So are you here to kill me?” This question seemed to offend her dramatically, she started to spring up to leave and said something like “What? No! That’s like 13 steps from now!” and seemed to be crying. I reached out and pulled her into my arms, saying “I’m sorry” and “Please don’t go” over and over and over. I was in her arms too. She said something like I was accusing her of being stupid, I said something like, “If you and I are connected then you can’t be stupid” (wow, arrogant much). I think we started to gently kiss, I moved down her neck, I saw her breasts, and then the dream just sort of faded.\n\nAnother note: the entire time it felt like there was a thumb being pressed into the small of my back, just hard enough to be uncomfortable, but not intolerable. \n\n\nSo, I’m just weirded out because the whole point of sleep paralysis is not being able to move, I could definitely move, and this wasn’t a dream state I’ve ever really allowed myself to be in. Just kina throwing it out there I guess.",

        "text": "So years back when I was still little, Maybe 8 or 9, I used to hate sleeping in my room. I always had an uneasy feeling at night and heard things frequently. I used to sneak out and go sleep on the couch in the living room just outside my parents room. I would have to be strategic about it, so I would camp out behind the rocker on the far side of the room until the light or tv would go out and then let some time pass for them to fall asleep before heading to the couch. So one night, after their tv went out and some time had passed, I was getting ready to go from my hiding spot to the couch when out from my parents bedroom walked a dark human like figure. It stood much taller that either of my parents, was very dark. I could not see any facial features but I distinctly remember peeking out from behind the rocker and seeing this thing begin a slow walk from their bedroom, across the far side of the living room, and into the hallway that led to my room and my sisters room. From where I was I couldn’t see which way it went, either left into my sisters room or right into mine. I stayed behind the rocker for the rest of the night and did not sleep. Years went by And I always felt uneasy at night but never saw anything else. My parents separated when I was 12 and I went to stay at my dads house. Immediately felt better and slept better at night. The house I grew up in was a newer home, I don’t think anything bad ever happened there. Never really talked about the incident since, just kept it bottled in.",

I checked on her in her room and she was in bed asleep.\nSo I took myself back to bed because at this point I’m a little freaked out and I have work at 7am. \nThen I had a dream that I was in an arcade waiting for my fiancé and this waitress was rude too me. I asked her what was wrong and she said well I was trying to hit on you but you ignored me when I called you over. \nIn my dream I remember being terrified, I couldnt see her face or anything then I suddenly flipped to a sexual dream, where I felt like I was being suffocated. I also had an overwhelming sense of panic and feeling like something was incredibly wrong.\nI tried to scream but no words came out, I finally realized I was asleep are started trying to wake myself up. Then my dream flipped to my dog snarling but her face was distorted and out of focus. \nI finally snapped myself awake and my dog was sitting up staring at me.

        "text": "A few months ago my mother brought me a stuffed cat from my grandma and I really liked it. I already had a teddy bear and a tiger and had slept with them since I was a kid.\n\nI started sleeping with my stuffed cat everynight and everything was fine, but about three or four months ago I bought a used brown stuffed bunny for one dollar at an institution where you buy things like clothes, toys and even food for a cheap price to help children with health problems.\n\nI left the bunny on top of my \"closet\" which is very small so it serves as a little \"table\" where I put a lot of things. Two days later I had a dream where it was being possessed and I couldn't get rid of it. I didn't mind that so much, but soon I started having lots of nightmares and also seeing things when I woke up. Like for example one day when I saw a red-haired doll on my bed and it slowly disappeared and a few days later my mom brought me a red-haired doll (I'm not a kid, I'm 17 but I still like toys a lot)\n\nThen all these thing stopped for a while, but now I've started hearing things (like full sentences) when I'm alone at home. I heard my mother ask \"are you taking a shower?\" and I called her name several times, but nothing. So I got out of the shower and not even my father was at home. Doors close on their own in front of me, i feel chills and touches in my body while I sleep and things fall beside me without explanation. One day I saw my nail file that was in front of my stuffed cat literally move and turn towards me.\n\nI also feel like I'm becoming a lot more aggressive, I've started to swear more and I also recently wished my brother would die, months ago I really wasn't like that.\n\nCould this have something to do with my stuffed animals? I feel very uncomfortable looking at that cat, I feel that it follows me with its eyes and is always watching me. I don't feel anything like that with my bunny, but I'm just a little afraid of it because of that dream.\n\nI also have something **really** embarrassing to say. I don't believe in god or the devil, but in August/september i prayed to lucifer. I saw a prayer on the internet for him to make a boy I thought I loved fall in love with me. I'm always a person who does things without thinking so I did the same prayer for two days but not for seven days in a row as written in the post I read...I never told anyone about this prayer I did. I was obsessed with him and thought I loved him, but today I see that he was not someone who deserves my love.\n\nNothing happened and we barely speak these days. Could this have something to do with what's going on?\n\n( And sorry if there's some grammar mistakes, english is not my first language )",

        "text": " \n\nHi all,\n\nHopefully a retelling like this is welcome here - this is a legitimate recollection of an event that happened over a decade ago. ( I'm going to say \"I remember\" a lot lol)\n\nAround 15 years ago, I fell asleep in my mom's room watching TV. I think I may have been sick or could've just been enjoying her super comfortable bed.\n\nI remember waking up in the dead of night, probably between 2AM and 4AM and had this feeling of pure dread - something I've never felt before. I remember that because we had these large tall windows that a lot of moon light made it into the room and basically flooded the room and made distinctive areas that did not get any light.\n\nI remember looking up and straight to the end of the room where my mom's double closet door was, and to each side of the closet was one of those dark areas because of the way the light hit. I remember the left corner of the room was especially dark, like pure black, moreso than any natural shadow is.\n\nThis dark corner was so dark I could physically see the difference in the dark. I then noticed that the dark was taller than the other corner, like somebody was hiding in it - it was so scary at the time and I threw the blanket over my head and held myself so tight. I physically felt something 7 feet tall move across the room and over to my side of the bed and loom over me when I was under the blankets - imagine a 7ft tall person in almost like a reaper's robe. That's the only way I could describe it. I basically kept saying to myself that it's just my imagination and to be fair, it probably was. But I will never forget that experience, I've never had it happen since then but still - will definitely always remember it.\n\nHave you guys had something similar happen?",

        "text": "For the past two months I've been dealing with 3+ ghost/spirit cats. I can't see them nor can I hear them. But I definitely feel them. It's always when I'm laying in my bed. When I first encountered them I really had no idea what it was. I knew something was there though. Then I started feeling things only a cat would do such as their grooming themselves and the vibrations they put out from their throat area when softly purring. So I'm 100% sure I'm dealing with cats. They seem to only be making their presence known to me as I do have my husband sleeping next to me every night. The only thing he has noticed is feeling something jump up on the bed but looking to see nothings there. One lays close to me, one heavy one lays across my feet, and the third walks around me mostly or gets underneath me. This happens every single night and every time I get in my bed. Needless to say, I'm not happy about this at all. It's not that I hate cats, I just don't want any living with me. Real or spiritually. They are keeping me up at night, I feel spurts of what I can only describe as \"electrical energy\" shooting through my body that literally gives me chills. They seem to be mostly attached to my feet area so I'm constantly feeling little tickles around my feet. Its maddening!!! I don't know why they've picked me to hang with. I've always had dogs all my life. Cats just aren't my thing. So now I'm trying to figure out how to make them go away. I've sprayed citrus spray on my mattress, beneath and around my bed, no luck. Then I switched to lavender oil. No luck. I mingled citrus and lavender.  Nothing. I spoke to them reasonably, saying they need to leave, they're dead, Jesus wants them with Him, I don't want them here. Still no luck. I bought pure Palo Santo wood fron Ecuador,  smudged my room and bed area, prayed and prayed for them to move on from me, that I don't want them here, but THEY WONT LEAVE!! Yesterday I set a recording up on a loop from a priest which was blessing my house and casting out all negative/unwanted spirits from my home but the cats were all over me last night. Right now I've set up a speaker between my bed mattresses blasting my husband's rock music in an effort to make them so uncomfortable,  that they don't want to be here anymore. I'm at my wits end with this.\nIf anyone out here can help me, I would welcome it! I just want the cats to go away completely forever. I'm a 60 year old, very sane, intelligent woman. I've only had three other encounters with the spiritual world before this but it was family members and they moved on. I don't know these cats, what they want, their purpose for being here, nor how to make them leave me alone. \nAll sincere advice, help, hints, tips are welcome. \nThank you!!!",

I look back and the vehicle was slowing down to almost a complete stop. Looked like a large sedan or an suv. I look away for a short moment and the vehicle is gone. Just completely vanished. Never heard it accelerate or anything. There isn't anywhere for it to turn off but the driveway. So i walk the short ways to the end of the driveway and there is no sign of the car. Has anyone else experienced something along these lines of a vanishing car? Ghost cars? Or any reliable relevant information?",

My son was throwing leaves and sticks for fun, making bigger flames and lots of smoke. \n\nSo, I was occupied with containing the fire. Through the smoke and out of the corner of my eye, I see him with his neck stretched up, listening attentively. \n\nThen he dashes as fast as he can walk towards the steps mumbling. Could hardly see him, while calling him back. A horrible feeling crawled over me like an unwanted stare or something I can’t describe . \n\nHe said “There’s a lady in the house, she’s give me a drink.” (It looked like something was pressed against the window of the front door. Shapeless and almost no light/color. More like a pressure.)\n\nMy son debated at the bottom of the steps, but I was able to quickly get him back. Took a bit to properly put out the fire. \n\nContext: 100% not allowed to start camp fires. Got stuck for one semester of school. This orphanage, now foster home, programs for troubled kids, and newer programs for single moms live on this campus. Was established in 1920s. It’s a religious organization.

        "text": "The first incident happened around the beginning of February last year. My partner had some work in Paris and we decided we were just gonna extend his trip so we can spend a week exploring, etc. Long story short, we were on the subway at night. I can't remember what day it was but it was definitely either a Friday or Saturday since it was truly packed. People were in and out of the train, nothing out of the normal.\n\n So immediately I notice a man walks onto the train. Tall like this man was at-least 6'3-6'4, well-kept, wearing all black business casual, huge scar running down his face. This man looked like a typical movie villain. Now, I never believed in energies or whatever until this encounter. This man truly gave off non-human vibes, dread, pretty much everything gross and scary all in one emotion. I literally had to look away and keep myself from getting nauseas from his energy. It literally felt like something was cosplaying being a human being. I also felt like he sensed me realizing that he wasn't human cause he stared me down the whole time with this weird fucking scary cold stare. Must I add, everyone on the train didn't even spare him a second glance. We left and from that point, I just had horrible violent nightmares throughout the trip. \n\nSo fast forward to these past couple of months, I've been noticing people stare at me the same way this man looked at me. One incident was Black Friday shopping at the mall and a woman a couple of feet from me was having a conversation on the phone and she was smiling, laughing etc. I could literally immediately see her expression change and she just looked up at me with the same blank scary ass stare as the guy from the train. Even my friend (a very confrontational person) was like wtf is that woman's deal. Couple of seconds of just staring, she just went back on talking like nothing happened. I had multiple incidents where people seem to immediately change their expression and look at me with the same dead, 'trance like stare', etc. The weird thing is I'll have the same feeling of nausea hit and then will have violent nightmares whenever I encounter these weirdos. \n\nAnybody have any similar stories or encounter? where you felt like something isnt human?",

        "text": "Hi y'all. I'm a little freaked out right now. Let me explain why, and then I'll ask a few specific questions.\n\nI've never doubted the existence of the paranormal/supernatural/whatever you want to call it, because it's literally in the Bible (I'm a Christian). However, a few days ago I joined this subreddit and since then things have taken a bit of a turn.\n\nI've been experiencing seemingly paranormal things when I'm trying to sleep. Most of it consists of: hearing loud, slow footsteps next to my bed; hearing breathing somewhere near me (I can't pin down where); and finally, changes in light levels while my eyes are closed. The best way to explain the last one is like this: you know when your eyes are closed, and it's dark, and then someone turns on the lights and you can recognize the change in light level even through your eyelids? It's like that, but in reverse. My eyes will be closed, and I'll notice it get darker, as if something is walking in front of me, and then it will go back to normal.\n\nAll that to say, I'm concerned. Now for the questions. \n\n1. Did I unknowingly let something into my room/house by joining this subreddit? Almost like an invitation or challenge?\n\n2. If yes, what do I do? Again, I am a Christian, so I know God will take care of me, but that doesn't necessarily mean he'll bail me out of this if I screwed up. So are there steps I can take (discreetly - I live in my parents' house) to get rid of whatever may be in my room?\n\n3. If no, what am I experiencing? I don't have a history of medical issues that come with hallucinations, but I suppose it's possible. My parents never come into my room, so I don't think it's one of them. Is there anything else that might explain my situation?\n\nThank y'all for your help. I know this post is long, but I really appreciate it. Hope y'all stay safe and happy!",

There are plenty of odd things that have happened but they can easily be something else. His sisters door closes and opens by itself? Most likely from her ceiling fan. Scratches near the base boards? Probably from their dog. Recently black smudged handprints have been seemingly appearing overnight. All over the walls and ceilings.

        "text": "Okay so me and my friend have witnessed these \"entities\" twice as of now. They are always black or grey and they only appear in an ominous part of our nearby forest. They also wary in shape and height. The smallest ones have been the size of an dog and the biggest have meen as tall as a tree. They don't have any features apart from their form and outlines. \n\nThey haven't been agressive any time we've witnessed them. Or should I say they have witnessed us. I say this because almost every time we see them they are somewhere observing or following us. They are always about 100-20 meters from us or 60-300 feet away. \n\nThey don't make sounds like normal animals do. Their sounds are different frequencies or at times womanly screaming. One thing is common that their sounds are high pitched. Also one of them (mr. Long Legs, I'll explain this in a moment) has produced a robotic sound.\n\nAlso they only appear in that one area in the forest. It is very different from the surrounding area because the trees are much taller and it's darker there. Also it feels like you shouldn't be there. The surrounding forest is also very flat but this place has height differences and little streams of water. \n\nLight makes them disappear. They cannot come during the day and only when it starts to dim they start to appear. Also the darker it is the further they can wander from the area. When they are in the light of a flashlight they disappear and they can't come to a lit country road near the place.\n\nOkay so I'll spare you from the stories(of which there are 2) of how we have seen them but I'll tell you all the entities(or entity. We don't know if it is only one or more because we've only seen one at a time)\nOkay so here they are:\n\nThe first one that we saw or as we call it the stump dog. It looks like a wide dog that's black. It can stand up higher if it wants. Then it is about 2 meters or 6 feet in lenght and it doesn't resemble a dog that much anymore.\n\nThe second one creatively named \"the stump\"\nIt is a tall creature that we saw at a distance so I can't really describe it that much except of it having almost like a robe, but it isn't a humanoid.\n\nThe third one \"the blob\"\nA 1 meter(3 feet) tall blob like entiny that follows. It also is black.\n\nThe fourth one or \"the crawler\"\nA dark pretty big entiny that crawls in the ground toward us. I didn't see it as well as my friend but he described it as being like a crawling big man.\n\nThe fifth one \"mr. Long Legs\"\nMr. Long Legs is a very very tall entity that is also the fastest of the one's that we've seen. It hides behind trees or tries to blend in as one. You can spot him because he doesn't have branches. As I said he is tall, about as tall as a tree. He is also the one that made the robotic sound.\n\nI have classed them into two types:\nThe observers\nAnd\nThe followers\n\nPlease tell me what the h@ll these beings are.",

I never really told anyone, except my girlfriend, which freaked her out.\n\nI remember this vividly and would like some insight, so I can make something out of this.\n\nThis is what happened. Me and my girlfriend where living in a house that belonged to her parents, but we payed them rent every month, 500 a month, not bad right? Well anyways, I remember being asleep in bed. I usually slept on the left side of the bed, and my girlfriend slept on the right side of the bed. I woke up in the middle of the night, and saw 2 alien beings that resembled grey aliens. Their skin color was greyish/brownish. Both were standing on the right side of the bed, next to my girlfriend who was asleep. I remember thinking that this couldn't be real, so what I did next was reach my right arm over to one of these beings in an attempt to physically touch one. What happened next is crazy, as my arm reached out to one of these beings, I saw one of them sort of wave his hand in front of me, which caused me to involuntarily and slowly fall back in place in bed and fall back asleep.\n\nAnd well that's all I remember, next morning when I woke up I remembered what happened vividly, yet I was not sure if this was some sort of dream or what. It sure didn't feel like a dream though.\n\nAnyways, that's all I got. What do you guys make out of this?",

        "text": "  I've felt off today, like something could happen if I and those I care about don't take care to be safe. I get these feelings pretty regularly, and sometimes will be given premonitory dreams that are far more specific. With these odd gut feelings, though, it's often hard to discern what's something external that I'm picking up on, and what could just be my own mind messing with me.\n\n\n Today, it's almost certainly the former, though. I told my brother to be sure he's careful and safe today, because I've got a fucked up feeling about something. He said he knew, and figures it's connected to something he saw lastnight. Apparently after I'd gone to bed, he'd stayed out hanging out with our dog and working on a chainsaw, and saw a huge red orb float up from the river bed and into the clouds on the other side of a family friend's pasture to the east of our house. Said it made him really uneasy, and he told our dog to get in her house, and stay safe, and she went in there and doesn't seem to have come out until he came out to check on her this morning. \n\n  I know red orbs are usually interpreted in two very different ways; either a sign of protection, or something angry and restless showing itself. Given my brother's gut reaction to it, and my feeling that something dangerous is about, I don't really think it can be anything but a warning or sign of something dangerous. It really shouldn't be surprising, though, because there's alot of evil lurking here in Oklahoma. Any time I've been out of the state for awhile the first thing I feel when I get back is just an oppressive, almost suffocating sense of dread that some very old evil is all around. Can't help but think of talking about it to one of my friends who's Choctaw about it, and his response just being \"why do you think we only settled here permanently when we were forced to? That shit doesn't like any humans being there.\" I definitely think he was right. I just hope me and my brother got enough of a heads up this time to keep it, whatever it is, at bay",

As real as it felt I still had doubts due to the lack of relationship I had with the person. They asked me to do something so I did. We sat and talked for a bit which wasnt like me as i have crippling social anxiety and cant openly talk like that. It was nice to experience an anxiety free conversation if anything.\n\n The 2nd is so special to me as it was my brother. He would've been my older brother but middle child. That is if I was even born. Mom wanted 2 kids and he would've been #2. My mother miscarried but I always loved my brother even without meeting him. When he came to me in my dream he looked nearly identical to my dad but I could also see a lot of my mom as well as my sister and myself. Strong family resemblance. He appeared the age he would be if he was born with a hipster beard and all. I knew who he was immediately. He asked how mom was doing and how is dad. Not my mom, just mom. We talked and I remember being so happy that he was finally here with me even if it was only for a little bit. \n\nI'm the only one in my family that believes in paranormal and things like that so I didn't want to tell my mom but I was just so happy for so many different reasons. Even if she thought I was bat shit crazy it seemed to make her happy. \n\nI've never met anyone that has also been visited in a dream though I've heard people talk about their experiences with it on TV. \n\nHave you ever been visited in a dream? I'd love to hear about it.",

On other instances this figure has appeared as a glitchlike mass of energy. \n\nBut yeah. In closing i'm posting here to widen my net to those that may have seen this woman. Her form tends to shift. So i cannot narrow it down 100% but this is one of her 'main forms'.",

        "text": "I’ve always been spiritual. I believe there are things in this world that we can not comprehend. \n\nOne night, back in April of 2022, I had a dream that I was suddenly moving upwards flat on my back in an empty void. It was almost like I was in a tornado or a cylinder shaped cavern. There was this calming sensation and it was quiet/serene. I started looking around me and I see that I was moving up towards a white opening and what seemed like other people with me in the distance. Then out of nowhere, I woke up in a bed in a strange room I had never been in before. I see a window above the bed and looked out. Everything seemed in what I can best describe as cartoony. The trees looked different and there looked to be people taking a walk with a dog. \n\nAll of the sudden, my wife and brother ran into the room to greet me as if they haven’t seen me in years. They each gave me a big hug and smiled while greeting me. I was relieved to see them and was confused at the same time. I asked “what’s going on? Where are we?” My wife said that we’re in “the next place” and that they hadn’t seen me in years and how they were all waiting for me to show up. I asked, “Am I dead?” And they said that I was. When I asked what happened, they told me the police think I was texting while driving. Suddenly, I had a flashback to me in my truck and looking down at my phone, when I looked up I saw a big semi truck veer towards me and hit my car. Very freaked out at this point I ask, “Is this real? What day did I die?” My wife looked at my brother and he said “August 22nd”. I was really freaking out at this point as it all seemed so real. That’s when I woke up screaming. I was covered head to toe in a cold sweat. I’ve never had a dream where I’ve woken up screaming. \n\nThis affected me very much. It had a hold on me. I wrote down everything immediately and told my wife and parents about this dream. My parents are spiritual too and took it as a sign of some kind. After months had passed I slowly let it go and passed it off as a crazy dream but still kept it on the back of my head. I couldn’t shake the thoughts completely. My wife and mom jokingly (and seriously) said not to do anything on August 22nd and to stay inside on that day. \n\nWhen August 22nd came around I was ready for it. I stayed in doors and my mom\neven called because she remembered. We talked and brushed it off. Once the day is over then I can get past this. Then the unthinkable happens….\n\nI get a call late at night from my mom. She regrettably tells me that my cousin had passed away from complications. My family had described it as being so sudden that it felt like he “died in a car crash”. I was stunned. I couldn’t believe it. \n\nDid I receive a message from the beyond that predicted DOWN TO THE DAY that a loved one would pass? Or, was this all a coincidence? It’s impossible to say and a crazy coincidence if it is one. All up to personal belief but it scared me big time.",
