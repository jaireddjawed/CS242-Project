        "text": "I've never topped when this lovely lady asked if we found everything alright and I responded, \"I just could NOT find where you guys sell dead hookers here.\" I thought she was going to do a back flip, she reeled so hard. \n\nAnother was asking if the paint the wife and I were buying was gluten free. \n\nToday, we had a bag of rawhide (for the vicious beast we keep in the house) that took a few tries to scan in. I've heard how countless cashiers are sick of hearing, \"Didn't scan? Must be free!\" So I piped up, \"If it doesn't scan, that means we burn the whole fucking store down, right?\" That girls face went from, \"Ugh...\" to the evilest smirk I've ever seen and, \"I'm not saying no...but I'm not saying yes either.\" \n\nGood times\n\nEdit:\n\nSome of y'all are WAY overthinking this. I'm not expecting anything, I'm not demanding anything. I'll cracking a stupid joke at another human being who is not there by choice. In a world of customers we all know and love, I chose to try for a laugh. Trust me, there's been PLENTY of times where I got the blank stare, the cold shrug, all of it. I chose to focus on the winners. Just trying to make a fellow human being laugh",

        "text": "Earlier today, my husband and I decided to branch out from our usual burger date to a different chain restaurant. I have celiac disease, which I know is a hassle for everyone involved, so I already hate eating out, but most places are very accomodating. \n\nWell, not this one. I'd told the waiter that I have celiacs and need the gluten free option, ordering a Caesar salad. Thought I didn't have to mention leaving the croutons off, because it's kind of implied with the gluten free hubbub. \n\nAs it turns out, I should've told him every last detail. Of course, my salad is full of croutons. I think to myself, maybe I can just pick them off and give the 'contaminated' pieces to my husband. Nope, crumbles throughout. So, he calls the server over while I get something from our car. Waiter tries telling me he thinks the croutons are gluten free, but they're asking the manager, and he's really sorry. Hey, it happens, I'm not going to condemn him for one small mistake. \n\nThe manager brings over my salad. The same salad from before. Crumbs everywhere, just the croutons picked off. I just left at that point, waiting for my husband in the car. \n\nLook, I know how shitty it is to make sure food is safe. And I'm not too finicky over most things, because I understand it's impossible to make an entire kitchen sterile just for one dish. But what happened there seems so disrespectful to me, and very insulting. It's as if they decided that I'm some stuck up idiot who's attention starved, and thought I wouldn't notice that they just took them off of it. Spending the next few days bloated, tired, and shitting constantly is just not worth it. \n\nUsually I have such good experiences, and the most wonderful waiters and waitresses who are understanding, but this place... they broke me. I don't think I'm gonna be eating out for a while. \n\nEDIT: For those concerned with my delicate better half being abandoned untimely, fear not! https://imgur.com/9rMU6g7.jpg",

She said that hair and makeup were £25 each but the trial for both is free. My mum and I watch her write down times and dates for the 27th on a piece of paper that i still have, as well as my actual prom (early July), agree to pay the total £50 the day of prom and skip on happily out.\n\nFast forward to the 27th. My parents are working (I'm 16, fyi), so I go alone (takes 30 to 40 mins by bus). I get to the salon and the very same receptionist tells me there is no booking for today.\n\nWhat?\n\nIt gets better - she tells me that there are no slots between now and my prom for a makeup trial. Only hair. I take the hair one, she gives me the time and date (it was today at 10), and then she gets a phone call. Then she walks off, still on the phone. Didn't say if I should wait or leave or what, I'm stood there feeling like an idiot, don't know what to do, upset about having spent half  an hour on a sweltering bus and about having to do the same to get home, all for nothing. So I leave - she already gave me the info I need. I don't wait to pay because the trial is free, right?\n\nSo today, I went with my mum again, at my mum's insistence- she was there when the original trial was booked, she knows the receptionist fucked up. Anyway, we get there and the owner of the place comes out - apparently the receptionist went to him and apparently they weren't sure if i was gonna come because *apparently* I \"stormed out, upset\" midway through booking it cos I'd turned up when \"nothing was booked\" (on the 27th) and was mad. He said I could now \"explain to my mother\" why there was uncertainty regarding today's hair appointment. Basically painting me as a spoiled brat who was angry at this poor, confused receptionist for my own mistake.\n\nKeep reading, it gets better. My hair got done, looks nice and everything, then the lady who did my hair takes us over to the till. \"That'll be £25 please\". Apparently, the trial is not free. The receptionist had said it was. My mum looks confused too. Apparently, the cost of the trial is the same as the cost of having it done on the day.\n\nWell, thank fuck there wasn't a makeup slot or it would've cost £100 total! *Twice* the original price we were told. \n",

Congratulations on solving a major crime, I hope you reported it to the local authorities.\n\nWhat gave you the clue that a crime was being committed?    When I left the office and used my key to lock the door, or maybe when I opened the gate with the operator I obviously had in my truck?    It’s a wonder the world can function without people like recording every situation they deem a concern.    \n\nI feel safe that you are out protecting the world with your dash cam.    \n\nThe one thing I don’t understand,  is the need to call me an idiot, did I offend you somehow?    \n\nThanks again for saving the world with your video surveillance, I for one feel safer.\n\"\n\nIt was HIM who broke the gate then gets all upset just because I titled the video \"idiot.mp4\" hahaha\n\nIf anyone else would have broken the gate i'm sure they would have been happy someone sent them a video of it, but NOPE.\n\nAlso I sent him a reply stating this:\n\n\"You are welcome, just make sure you let me know when the gate gets repaired and I will let you know if anyone else breaks it again!\n\nHave a nice day!\"\n\n\nHe replaced the gate last week but never responded to my followup email hahaha\n\nI'll post a new picture of the fixed gate when I get a chance, because the arm they replaced it with looks completely different and is at a different angle than the other one. EDIT: Here it is https://puu.sh/AR4QK/d081156b2c.jpg hahaaha\n\nEvery day when I go home I see this and it makes me chuckle. :)\n\nTL;DR: I record someone breaking a security gate with my dash cam, I decide to email the company to let them know, and the guy who I emailed was the guy who broke it and he got SUPER PISSED OFF!\n",

She finished my eyeshadow with black and dark purple. \n\n\nI couldn’t even ugly cry because I’d ruin the $40 travesty my SIL paid for.

PG may not have been delivering since 13.\n\nFYI: I have a fair bit of irrelevant information included, i just like being descriptive. Sorry if that makes this boring.\n\nThis happened at least 1 month ago, maybe 2 (Wasn't exactly paying attention to the date). Decided to order a custom XL pizza from Franchise Pizza place. Was told the approx wait time would be 55-65 minutes. Sure whatever, added the tip before checkout (Was only like 5-7 bucks even at 20%).\n\nAnyway, Im waiting outside on the porch about 5 minutes before the estimated arrival. Guy drives up, pulls out the pizza bag, walks up, and asks \"Are you so and so with two orders of &lt;Insert ingredients of custom pizza here&gt;?\" Me: \"Umm...no? I only ordered one pizza.\" PG: \"Really? You sure these aren't yours?\" Hands boxes to me Me: \"Well, my name is on both of them, that's for certain.\" PG: \"Well, this is weird.\"\n\nOut of curiosity, I open one of them and see half of the pizza I ordered. Well that explains it. Opening the other one confirms it.\n\nMe: \"Mystery solved. The pizza is split in half in two boxes.\" PG: \"Seriously? Why'd they do that?\" PG: \"I've been delivering ~~since i was~~ for 13 years, and I've literally never had this happen before.\" \n\nThis is where it gets a little odd, at least from my point of view.\n\nPG: \"Listen man, to make up for this, I want to offer to get you a free pizza.\" Me: \"Umm, that's a generous offer, and I normally wouldn't say no to a free pizza, but technically the order isn't wrong or messed up. Just packaged weird.\" PG: \"Come on, you gave me a really good tip, the least I can do is return the favor. I'm good friends with the store manager and i'll try to set something good up for you.\"\n\nI decline again and eventually (or so I think) persuade the guy to not worry about it.\n\nGo back inside, hop on the Xbox, where me and a buddy talk about the interaction. We come to the conclusion that they must have run out of XL boxes and had to use two Ls to send out the order.\n\nLess than 2 minutes later, I get a phone call. Lo and behold, it's the super persistent pizza guy.\n\n\"Hey, this is PG who delivered your pizza.\" Proceeds to confirm what me and my buddy figured\n\nAnd then he tries once more to offer to reimburse me. A+ for persistence. I politely decline, somewhat insistently myself, saying that I would not feel right accepting a free pizza if the store did nothing wrong. After a few minutes, we end the call.\n\nAbout an hour later, i get another phone call, this time from a number different fromt the one PG called me from. I usually don't answer numbers I don't recognize, so I ignore it. I later get a text from PG stating that he talked with his manager, and he hopes that said manager managed to hook me up. That explains who called me. I try to call the manager back to tell them not to worry about PG's offer, but its registered as a private number, so no luck there.\n\nTL;DR - Ordered an XL pizza from Franchise Pizza place. Delivery guy arrives with two boxes instead of 1, insists on multiple occasions on-site and over 1 phone call to reimburse me, I decline because no error was committed by the store.\n\nI've been contemplating since the whole event on going to the store in person, and asking the manager on duty to tell the PG that I appreciated his dedication to caring on me having a good experience, and giving him a tip for that. Should I?",

I tried to say \"the change is just the coins plus a ten\", and she mostly understood it, but still had to call a manager to make sure she didn't mess up.  I didn't argue.  \n\nMeanwhile there was suddenly a huge line. Manager finally comes over, assesses the situation and says \"yeah just give him a ten, its fine\".  \n\nAgain,  I was pretty annoyed,  but not really with the cashier.   I'm annoyed at the culture we have that makes people so terrified of a small mistake that they can't even think.  Also, is there actually a POS system out there that tracks denominations so precisely, that it would make a cashier question whether they could just give change?   That sounds like the kind of thing that some dumbass executive would implement.   \n\nOk, vent over.  ",

        "text": "TL;DR at bottom.\n\nGetting an abortion is a horrible, stressful, and emotional experience. You're at your last contingency, and nothing has worked out up to this point. That's why you'd expect the workers at (following the anonymous rule) Pained Parentalhorse to be able to provide a small sense of comfort for yourself as well as the other unfortunate souls who need it. \n\nNope.\n\nMe and my wife walked into the clinic one afternoon. I got off work early to provide emotional support for her. The reception was already cold from the.. well... receptionist. Her remarks were sarcastic and apathetic. Her attitude made me believe she expected me to know all this already. We had a few packets worth of information, waivers, and agreements to fill out, as well as a chit for payment, which was more expensive than the phone scheduling said. The information packet was especially fucked. The pages were printed on 2 sides, which isn't an issue, but some were flipped horizontally and some were flipped vertically, so there were upside down pages in the packet.\n\nAs we were waiting another lady came in. It was only 1pm, and the clinic was still open for the next 3 hours. The lady asked for an appointment for an emergency contraceptive, and she looked really hurt, like something awful had happened the past day. \n\nThe receptionist laughed her out, saying they were booked and she should have called in for an appointment next week, which is after the deadline to use something like Stan-Z (does that need to be anonymized?). Me and my wife looked at each other nervously. This woman was just shooed off with a laugh from the woman responsible for making the appointment. \n\nOur appointment scheduled for 2 didn't take place until 3, in which a nurse kindly took my wife to the back room, promising that she'd come back for me after the initial look. The nurse came back about 30 minutes later for me, and gave me a little visitor sticker. As I was signing in as a visitor, a tall tattooed woman (a patient) walked out quickly with no medical escort. She looked like she had really rough treatment, and her face was crinkled with anger and stress. She walked out the clinic through the lobby, and one of the nurses talking to the receptionist said something along the lines of \"what a slut.\" \n\nI sat down in the medical room and waited for my wife. They gave her an ultrasound to see how far along she was (small bean, actually had to zoom in really far to even see it). She had opted for the pill solution, as it was less invasive, and she qualified based on how early the pregnancy was (less than 10 weeks from last period). The nurse that gave the ultrasound brought in a paper cup of water and said it was for the first pill, and that the doctor would be in shortly with the pills, the first you take in the clinic, and the next exactly 24 hours later. \n\nIt was 10 minutes until closing time when she said that. \n\n2 hours go by. 2 entire hours. It was almost 5. I could hear the trash was being taken out and most of the staff had left. Nurses and reception were saying their goodbyes to each other, and my wife was anxious. She asked if maybe they forgot about us. I was frustrated, but I held it in because I needed to be that shoulder for support. I told her I'd open the door and look down the hall to see if I could find someone. A nurse heard the door creak open and looked around the corner at me with wide eyes.  I immediately shut the door from embarrassment and sat down. A few minutes go by and the same nurse walked in flustered. She was apparently getting ready to leave when she forgot that she had a patient to attend to. She brought in some paperwork but noticed we already had it. \n\n\"You have the wrong packet, miss.\" The nurse said, taking it. She gave us a new one and began talking about the pill, side effects, what to expect, etc. I noticed her lab coat was just a Grey's Anatomy coat (it said so on the tag near the bottom) and her fancy looking titles on her name plate were just variations of Registered Nurse. The information she provided was inconsistent with everything we had been told so far, and it made my wife visibly nervous. Still, she took the pill and we said our goodbyes. On the way out I stole a sticker that said Hap-Penis and it made me chuckle.\n\nForward to a few days later, after the worst of the worst in terms of a pill abortion (Google it yourself, I'm not gonna explain), my wife wanted to file an anonymous complaint, because of the way we were treated by staff, as well as the way staff treated other patients. The website had a chat function where you could talk with a corporate operator and get information on what to do. Unfortunately, whenever she mentioned that she wanted to file an anonymous complaint, the operator ended the chat, because they wanted her information and she refused to give it. We have a follow up this week, and she doesn't want any more mistreatment based off her complaint, hence the anonymous approach. \n\n--\n\nTL;DR - A network of nurses working in a controversial field repeatedly mistreated hurt patients and even laughed them out and shamed them. We were forgotten about, given false information, and overcharged. \n\nClosing thoughts - I'm not here to provide arguments for the pro-life/pro-choice debate. This is an actual experience I've had dealing with the industry, and upon further research, extends past the abortion industry into all major nursing institutions, such as nursing homes and toxic hospital environments. Please don't debate me in the comments. Provide similar experiences, or if you'd like, questions that don't bring up specifics such as those that violate the anonymous rule. Thank you for taking the time to read this.",

        "text": "Repost with company names changed..\n\nI first had internet service through a company that now brags about price for life (I'll call them GreenMonster) in college. Service wasn't great then. We'd suddenly have super slow internet, would call them up, they told us they would send someone out to check connections outside the apartment. 5 minutes later, speed was back up to what we were paying for. Service tech never sent out. This happened at least once a month. Green was pretty obviously slowing down our speeds during peak times, but we weren't paying a lot for service (less than $40/month for 40 megs/s) so we let it slide.\n\nTwo years ago when we bought our first house (now married), I was told by Green's top competitor, xCast, that xCast did not offer service. (Strange mistake by their support reps). So I get Green again. \n\nThe first problem I experience is that Green's internet doesn't allow me to buy my own router, I have to rent. This is probably just the case in my neighborhood, but that's an assumption. This is annoying, but not aggregious.\n\nAfter 18 months with them, I go to pay my bill online. (I do not sign up for auto-pay because I do not want to have that 'fun' surprise bill when your promotional period has run out). I discover that I have a $10 late fee. According to my records, I paid the bill the month before on time. I try to pay the bill anyway, and the website won't let me pay by direct deposit (it pisses me off to be charged 10% to pay by credit card). \n\nI chat on customer service about being unable to pay. This customer service rep tells me the bill pay site is down at the moment in my area (wtf?) and that I should try again tomorrow. I try the next day, same thing, same explanation from customer service chat rep. \n\nAfter waiting another week, I login to my bill and am 'greeted' by another $10 late fee. I'm pissed since Green wouldn't let me pay multiple times. I call customer service this time. Finally, it is explained to me that I had entered my account number incorrectly a couple months ago, explaining my first fee. (Was never notified about this). Since this is the 2nd time this happened, Green automatically disabled this payment option for me. (Was not told this either; rather, was told the site was down). I explained this to the Green person, and she refused to cancel my late fee. \n\n1 month later I switched to xCast. Now I'm waiting to see how I'll get screwed over by them.\n\nTL;DR   I was forced to pay an additional late fee after 2 service reps told me the bill pay site was down. Switched to the other evil company.",

        "text": "Last week, I was on holiday with my family. Though we didn't go abroad, it *felt* like we were in another country, thanks to fantastic weather that we rarely get in my home country. It had been an enjoyable week, somehow both busy and relaxing at the same time, but, as all good things do, it eventually came to an end. And so on Friday, our last day before heading home, we decided, as we always do at the end of a holiday, to go out for our final meal.\n\nWe chose a pub in the small seaside town where we were staying. It had a good score on a certain travel reviewing site (I'm not sure whether saying the name breaks the anonymising rules) and we liked the look of the food, so it seemed perfect. My dad disagreed, but the rest of us outvoted him so we went anyway.\n\nWe went in and asked for a table for five - me, my parents, my sister, and her boyfriend. The waitress told us they were fully booked in the main restaurant area, so we could either go into the downstairs overflow area or sit out in the beer garden. We decided to go downstairs (to avoid getting bitten by insects), and the waitress instructed a younger waiter to take us there. Like a modern Pied Piper, he led us out the main entrance to the pub and back in through another door, then down a step staircase. At the bottom was an old wooden door like you might find in a haunted house, and he struggled with the key for a minute before finally managing to get the door open.\n\nThe smell was the most immediately noticeable thing about the room he led us into: it was musty and damp, like it hadn't been used in years. The rough blue walls were cracked, the paint peeling, and I wouldn't have been surprised if the corners had been filled in by cobwebs. Surprisingly, the lights actually came on when he flicked the switch, but that did little to improve it. An understocked bar greeted us on one side of the room, and the waiter seated us at a table next to the window. There were no fine sea views like there had been upstairs, however. This room was at least a storey beneath it, below even the beer garden. The bottom of the benches and parasols in the beer garden was set atop the backdrop of a glorious blue sky (the only good thing about the view); in the foreground, a grey breezeblock retaining wall and a line of wheelie bins piled high with empty cardboard boxes. We spent some time contemplating the view and the menus, placed our drinks order, then decided to move outside just as the waiter was returning with our drinks.\n\nThe beer garden was nothing special. Concrete paving slabs, wooden picnic benches with navy blue parasols. It was busy, but we managed to find an empty table overlooking the beach.\n\nThen my dad noticed that the wine they'd brought was wrong. He'd ordered a Chilean Sauvignon Blanc; the waiter brought a Californian one, which he can't stand. Whether they'd expected we wouldn't notice or not I can't say, but it did turn out they'd run out of the Chilean, so he ordered a different one instead. My mum also noticed that her wine glass still had lipstick from its previous user around the rim. Not a good sign, but the waitress brought her a cleaner replacement, so we moved on.\n\nWhen the waitress brought the replacement wine, she looked at the menus we'd brought out from the pub's interior and said, \"Oh, you can't use the indoor menus out here. The beer garden is part of the bar, so I'll have to bring you the simpler menus.\" That was a bit weird, but we just kind of shrugged and accepted it. \"Oh, you'll also have to go and collect your drinks from the bar,\" she added. \"We don't serve the tables out here. I'll bring you your wine and water this time, but you'll have to go to the bar from now on.\"\n\n\"Hello, could we book a table please?\" My dad said into the phone just as the waitress was leaving.\n\nWhile we considered the menus, my mum and my sister's boyfriend decided they wanted to have a look at the specials board. In most pubs, that's pretty reasonable, but here, not so much.\n\n\"You can't go in there!\" The waitress scolded my sister's boyfriend when he tried to go through to look at the board, as if, simply by virtue of being in the bar area, he was some kind of scum to be kept out of the restaurant area.\n\n\"But I just want to look at the specials board!\" He protested.\n\n\"Well we've sold out!\" She snapped back.\n\nHe and my mum returned to the table with their tails between their legs.\n\nWe had a jug of water at the table, along with five small glasses to drink it from. They were sitting empty for the moment, but we were planning to refill them. Apparently though, the pub staff had other ideas. As we sat talking, finishing our drinks and having decided by then not to stay for food, a man who we at first took to be another customer came and stood at the head of our table. With a handlebar moustache and long, unbrushed, grey hair tied back in a ponytail, my mum thought he looked like Lemmy from Motorhead, and having seen a picture of him, I can see the resemblance.\n\n\"Are you done with those glasses?\" He mumbled around a lit cigarette hanging limply from his lips.\n\nThinking he was a drunk, we nodded, and he picked up four of the five water glasses in one hand, leaving behind two used beer glasses in the process (which he then came back to collect). We were left staring at one another in bemusement.\n\nWe now think he may have been the owner.\n\nAs our glasses finally emptied, our waitress reappeared. \"Are you still planning on eating?\" She asked.\n\n\"No, I think we'll just finish our drinks then leave,\" my mum replied.\n\n\"Well in that case, I'll need you to pay for your drinks as soon as possible,\" the waitress said.\n\n\"Okay, we'll pay on the way out,\" my mum assured her.\n\n\"No, I really need you to pay as soon as possible,\" the waitress insisted. \"It's just that there's a way out onto the beach.\"\n\nMy mum immediately started laughing hysterically. She'd never been suspected of leaving a restaurant without paying before. \"Don't worry,\" she managed to gasp out between bouts of laughter, \"we wouldn't leave without paying.\"\n\nThe waitress remained unamused. \"Even so, I need you to pay as soon as possible. I'll go and get the card machine.\"\n\nShe did as she said, and we finished our drinks, paid, and left without leaving a tip. The place we ended up going - the pub my dad had wanted to go to right from the beginning - was much nicer. As much as I hate to admit it, he was right.\n\nBut it doesn't end there, though this is a pretty small thing. My dad was on the phone as we were leaving, and ended up accidentally leaving his camera at the table. He returned to the pub later that evening, a bit worried about being recognised (especially after the bad review he wrote them on the review site I mentioned earlier). They didn't recognise him though, and he ended up being helped by none other than Lemmy the glass thief, who found and returned his camera to him. So there's that, I guess.",

        "text": "So earlier today I had an insane encounter with the parking garage i use to store my work vehicle in. I own a small plant maintenance business in a major city (no street parking), and rely heavily on my van to fulfill orders and services. Anyway, here's some basics of the situation:\n\nI pay a flat rate monthly fee on a third party app, both app and flat rate are pre-approved by the garage. They auto-charge my bank account monthly, on the 19th of every month.\n\nWell, around the beginning of last month one of the attendants told me that I he wanted me to start paying them directly, in cash, for my parking. I didn't see a problem with that and said if that's what I had to do then that's fine. He didn't make it seem like that was the **only** possible way to continue parking in the garage, it more just seemed like that was his preferred method of payment. He has a very thick accent so I could have missed something, but I really think I got all my info right. I assumed they just wanted to cut out the kickback that the app gets or something, which is fine whatever, I didn't give it enough thought to really care that much. I figured they would just ask me for cash on the 19th of the next month, which would have been fine, I'm a super easygoing person and totally wouldn't mind cutting the app out if it means the garage gets a little more money - they had always been super nice!\n\nFast forward to the 19th of June, and the app had already auto charged me and said the garage received my payment. I thought \"oh, huh, looks like they are still running my card through the app, okay\". Nobody at the garage said anything about it to me, as this is how I have paid before, they were nice, pleasant, and courteous as usual, and continued to be for the next week and a half, so I figured everything was fine. Yesterday I even double checked with the owner who said I was good to go. Great!\n\nSo today I come in, and usually I just say hi to whoever's working, go to my van and drive it out (it's a valet service but I feel weird asking them to do it if they're already slammed) but today it was parked waaaaaay back behind like, five cars, making it impossible for me to get it out. They have literally never done that. I go down and let them know, and one of the guys immediately starts saying \"I know you don't pay. You don't pay. Not paying\" Or something along those lines (he has a very thick accent as well, but it was definitely \"NOT PAYING\"). He was like, creepily *smiling* like he'd caught me in a lie or something and I was totally taken aback. I assumed he was confused. Weird.\n\nThen the guy who originally told me he wanted cash shows up to work. He asks me how I am and we exchange pleasantries blah blah blah, and then he hits me with it. This guy tells me straight up I didn't pay him in the method that he wanted me to - **so he wasn't going to let me leave with my vehicle.** They had parked it in on purpose so I couldn't take it until I paid them an ADDITIONAL $260 on top of the $305 i had already paid on the app. I was FLOORED. What? I showed him my receipt, my parking pass that was valid until July 19th on the app, and my bank statement, and he absolutely refused to let me get in **my** van unless I paid him $260 cash right then and there. Both the other attendants were not only also refusing, but being extremely mean and accusatory and telling me he made it clear and i was to blame, and honestly making me feel horrible and very very embarrassed (I was getting really flustered because I was in a hurry there was a family waiting and watching - super humiliating). And while I do look somewhat intimidating (I'm pretty tall for a woman and heavily tattooed/ big resting bitch face), I am really, *really* non-confrontational so this really broke me down to the point where i was openly crying in the garage. I told then I didn't have another almost 300 to give them and that I'd already paid for my parking pass and they just didn't seem to care at all. Eventually I called my roommate to come and after calling more friends to come down there they just decided to let me leave. THEN, the demanding cash guy tells me that, \"fine okay you can have your van, but you need to pay *me* (not the garage, not the owner, *me*) in cash next month\". NEXT MONTH?! are you insane? I'm never going in there again!\n\nAnyway, what the hell just happened? Is this a parking scam that garage attendants run? Was this just an isolated incident? Maybe the third party app is to blame? Either way i'm never going back there, the app was super understanding and is working on refunding me - I guess we'll see about their validity then. I'm afraid another garage will do this to me again but I have to have somewhere to put my van. Ugh. I just don't know why they had to be so overly mean about it. Very weird. ",

According to my dad, the driver was nice and empathetic on the scene, but since then, there were a variety of situations that pissed him off. He called Company X and, not two days later, red flags appeared over the horizon, starting with hidden fees, ending up in a total cost of $546, $275 of which was just to tow the car only 3 miles.\n\nFast forward to today, where we actually get the car. Something to keep in mind, my dad actually had something to do in Dallas and, after learning about the fees, cancelled those plans and came home. we went to the lot, believing that they’d accept card (because my dad had just talked to them about whether or not they had card readers) and finally, 5 minutes *after* a later time that *they* had set because the worker was late, she finally arrived. We started with what we wanted to do, which was nothing more than to move my dad’s car out of their lot, and she asked, on repeat, if we were keeping the car in the lot.\n\nAfter we got that little situation sorted, we got onto the subject of payment. We asked her about paying by card, and she says that no one, not her nor the tow driver, could accept card, directly contradicting what we’d heard over the phone, again saying it on repeat, “We don’t accept card.” Thank the Gods my dad is a more patient than I, because I would’ve lost it when she repeated that.\n\nSo we run to our local bank (which was nearby, and we told her as much), withdraw the money, and return, but PLOT TWIST! She left. She left in a shorter time than we waited for her, so we called her. And this woman was quite rude over the phone, telling *us* we were disrespectful after what *she’d* done and telling my dad that he needed to “calm down” when he was just as calm as he normally is, and told us that it’ll be 20 minutes before the tow driver reached us, of which as of the time of writing, they’re 10 minutes late already. The situation is still developing, and I’ll post the update.\n\nUPDATE: The tow guy eventually came, and took off $50 because the initial tower told my dad that there was a cleanup fee because some fluid was leaking, when there was none. We also found out that the steering wheel was perfectly fine, despite the initial tower saying that the wheel was locked and wouldn’t turn. We actually managed to get the company all the way back to our house, but it’s still looking like the car will be totaled or expensive to repair.",

        "text": "I was just reading a post about a customer helping an employee avoid complying with their awful manager's request, and a comment about wishing there was a way for employees to communicate to customers that they need help prompted me to share this story.\n\nSomeone went into our local Taco Hell yesterday, only to discover that it was hotter inside than outside - and the outside thermometer was over 100 degrees (38 Celsius).   That guy asked the employees why it was so hot, and they told him the air conditioning had been broken for a month and the owner wouldn't fix it.\n\nCustomer took his tacos to go so he could eat in the comfort of his air conditioned office, but while he was doing so he posted the issue along with the owner's name and phone number to Nextdoor (a social media app oriented around neighborhoods and towns).  Someone else added the phone number and website for the corporate office, and OSHA was mentioned.  Lots of people started replying that they'd called or texted the owner.  The person at corporate was appalled that the owner was making people work in that heat and said she'd deal with it immediately (business hours were almost over, but she was prioritizing this case).  \n\nIn the mean time, people pointed out all the other great places around here to grab Mexican food. No need to patronize that place and give money to the shitty owner. \n\nSomeone finally posted that the owner said he had called the hvac company and had it scheduled for the first available day - a week from now - so we should give him a break.  That got a clear \"Hell no!\" reply. He's had 4 weeks to deal with this and didn't, so he needs to pay whatever the emergency charge is to get someone out there right away instead. \n\nApparently everyone took that to heart and kept calling, because today someone saw a crane working by the a/c unit at the restaurant.\n\nI'm looking forward hearing that the workers have reasonable conditions again, thanks to customers and the community rallying on their behalf.\n\nCustomers can help correct the imbalance of power between wage workers and management on occasion, and it's awesome!

        "text": "I was employed at a large $fruit consumer electronics store for 5+ years. As such I was very familiar with $fruit products and used exclusively the $Phone.\n\nAfter I left the job, I order my $Phone 7 online, and it shipped to my home. I had no trouble setting up the device and getting it to function, but something was wrong with the cell signal receptivity. The signal was about 1-2 bar consistently and would not allow LTE at times. I gave it about a week or two to try out because I thought it was just my location at first, and I even swapped out the sim card to no avail. I figured something was wrong with the phone after I tried the new sim card in my old $Phone 6 and it had full service.\n\nSo I call into support to try and set up an appointment at the gBar, a lady picks up and asks me what the issue is. I explain to her the signal sucks and I suspect the hardware might be defective and I'd like to book an appointment to get it checked. She says \"oh okay, let's do a diagnostics now over the phone to see if everything is fine.\" I went along with it because I had free time and nothing to lose anyways. She spends 10-15 minutes setting up the routine diagnostics tool (I've done this for customers before, usually this is only to test damage and phone integrity) and runs it all the way through. Half way through it she actually had to restart it because something went wrong on her end, I let it slide and decide to just let her finish the process.\n\nAfter the diagnostics she says: \"Diagnostics seems fine. Are you sure you're connected to wifi? Maybe the signal is weak\" I paused for a second and said, \"Yes, but I don't have a problem with wifi.\"\n\nShe hesitates and says \"Well sometimes having no wifi can affect your signal, so you want to make sure it's strong.\"\n\nAt this point I knew she was a dumbass who didn't know what she was doing. So I tell her \"Look, if we're done I just want to set up the appointment.\"\n\nShe responds to me with a stronger tone like she is pissed at me \"Sir, I'm just guiding you through our standard diagnostics procedure before we get to the appointment. Can you try one more thing for me? I need you to swipe up on your main phone screen and click on the Airplane icon.\"\n\n\"That's airplane mode.\" I responded.\n\n\"Yes, that's correct. I need you to turn it on and tell me what happens with the signal.\" She replies.\n\n\"You want me to hang up and use airplane mode?\" I asked, hoping she would catch her stupidity.\n\n\"No, I need you to stay on the phone with me and click on the button. When it's on, let me know how many bars of signal you see. Let me know if *you* have trouble finding it.\"\n\nI was speechless at this point. After a few seconds of pause she asked \"Hi are you still there?\"\n\nI decided to just hang up the phone on her.\n\n\\--\n\nThe next day I went into the store and got the entire phone exchanged. I decided to call back into support and talked to a manager to give feedback. I let them know what I was told, and that as an ex-employee, I felt almost ashamed that this person had been employed by the company. The manager said she was flabbergasted at the conversation, and that she will investigate to ensure that all staff are adequately informed of procedure and technical know-how.",

Before I presented my usual order to the cashier, I hysterically asked her if the secret menu is available because haha why not? A Yes or a No is the only thing that I will have in exchange so I just went for it. . . Then after she grasped my question, she 'secretly' told me that THERE IS a Secret Menu. She took the laminated menu under the tray where all the ketchupps where placed and oh man I Never felt so happy in my entire life. I had to rub my eyes twice to double check if the menu that I'm holding  is actually legit. I tried something in the secret menu which is a combination of fish fillet and a burger meat and after placing my order the cashier whispered to me saying \"keep this menu as a secret if you don't want anyone else to try it out with you\" . . \n\nFin.",

        "text": "Formatting, mobile, you get it. \n\nSo this takes place on the weekend before Memorial Day this year, It’s just taken me some time to get around to posting this. I’m in speech and debate, and I made it (somehow) to the National tournament down in Washington D.C. this year. Most of my rounds were in the convention center attached to my hotel, so I was expecting to be in and out of my room a bit that day. \n\nAs I was heading out of the door to my rounds, I thought my keys were in my wallet, you know, where any competent human would have them. \n\nTurns out that my keys were definitely not in my wallet. I only found this out after busting my ass competing for the day and just wanted to change out of my heels and dress clothes. \n\nSo I wander down to the hotel front desk where I walk up to the available FDA and try to be as nice as possible, I know humanity can suck especially when you work in the service industry so I try to be humane since I knew this was my mistake. FDA will be the front desk attendant and ME will be, of course, me. \n\nME: Hi! Sorry to bother you, but I somehow lost my room key, and I needed to ask if I could get a spare. Again, sorry!\n\nFDA: No problem! Just give me your name and room number and I can sort this out for you. \n\nSince I was here for the tournament, my room had three different competitors names on it, and I had no idea what it was under. Being under 18 without a drivers license or a school id (because why would the state of PA ever think those are necessary?) I had really nothing to show her. I feel terrible, but thankfully I have my schematic that has my name, school, and diocese on it. She says that she can make an exception and use it because she knows I’m just a high schooler with nothing else on me. \n\nShe hands me my new keys and I’m beyond grateful as I just want to watch Friends with my roommates and take a nap. \n\nSo the elevators in this hotel require a key to use, and when I went to swipe mine, it wouldn’t register it. I was confused, but convinced I didn’t do it right. Thankfully another competitor swiped there’s and we were on our merry way. So I get to my room, and lo and behold, my key doesn’t work. \n\nI trek all the way back down to the lobby, and I’m still convinced this is somehow me not knowing how to properly use a key card, and I think I’m a gigantic idiot. \n\nI walk up to the same attendant and explain to her what happened. She apologizes, and says she also has no idea why they wouldn’t work. \n\nFDA: you know what? This should work. Here’s keys for you and your roommates because I’m gonna change the keys to your room. \n\nShe hands me three keys, and I’m again going up to my room to finally get out of the hell that is heels. Have you noticed I don’t like heels yet?\n\nSo I get in the elevator, but this time there’s no other competitors with me. I scan all the cards, but suspiciously only one of them works. I say fuck it, I can still use one of them. I wander to my room and try the locks. \n\nAnd what do you know? None. Of. The. Keys. Work. \n\nThankfully at this point my other roommate, Kate, was in there at the time. She lets me in and I explain everything to her. She’s as confused as I am, so we decide to see if her original key still works. And what would you know, all the original keys still work. \n\nThis was especially confusing, because I verified my room number no less that 10 times. There was no possible way she could have misheard me at that point. \n\nSo to whoever’s keys where changed out of the blue at the NCFL National Tournament this year, sorry bud. ",

We were driving home tonight from helping family move and our temperature warning light kicked on. The temperature gauge was in the red. We stopped and checked the coolant, the reservoir was bone dry. Oops. I had had a coolant leak in the past that they told me was fixed, guess maybe I shouldn’t have been so blasé about it, I should have kept a closer eye on the coolant.\n\nAnyway, we had all the kids in the car, half hour drive from home, it’s getting late, and as I said before it’s very hot out. I can’t leave my kids out in this heat, especially not the baby. So we looked up the nearest gas station and drove there, fortunately not too far.\n\nRan in and asked for coolant, the guy sent me to the aisle, then followed me outside after checking me out. I had asked him some questions about how long you have to wait before adding coolant, so he knew we were a bit clueless. He gave us a towel to open the radiator cap with (radiator was completely empty too), and a funnel, then had me and the kids go inside to cool off while my husband waited for the car to cool down enough to add fluid. \n\nAnother customer came up as I was getting the kids in. My five year old started saying, “He’s smoking mommy!” Fortunately the guy wasn’t offended, he helped my husband fill the radiator and get the air out of it. Also recommended checking the oil for water to be sure we hadn’t blown a gasket or anything. He stuck around and helped for a good 15 minutes. Several other customers stopped to offer advice as well.\n\nWhile they were doing this, the gas station guy gave us a drink cup so I could get water for my kids, and talked to the kids. Once things were going, he told us to keep the towel, and encouraged us to feel free to fill the empty container with water, just in case something went wrong on the way home. \n\nFunny thing is, my husband hadn’t wanted to stop at that gas station, he felt it was a bit sketchy and wanted to go further to a different one, but I refused. I knew we were pushing it driving the van at all with it overheating. And it turned out that the “sketchy” store with the “scary biker” customers turned out to be a lifesaver for us. We made it home safe, if a little late, and the car gave us no trouble. It’s going straight to the shop tomorrow to make sure we didn’t damage it and to try again to figure out where the leak is.\n\nEdit: Turns out the water pump is leaking like a sieve, a new issue. So I'm not to blame like I thought.",

At this restaurant, once you order you sit down with a number they’ve assigned you and they’ll bring everything out once it’s ready.

Some time goes by,I check on the other kids and see that my in-laws have received their food. Ok, got sent to the kitchen at almost the same time and it’s a smaller order, so it could be done first. A little more tome goes by and my wife and I are wondering what’s going on. Check the receipt and it’s been 30 minutes. So I head up to the counter where someone goes to check on it. Turns out, it’s been ready and no one brought it out to us. A manager finds out and gets the kitchen started on remaking it (it sat so long it was cold at this point). She apologizes immediately, isn’t sure what went wrong because she just started her shift but steps up and handles it. She gets everything remade, bags it up for us (decided to bring it home to eat since in-laws have completely finished their meal), comps our order, and gives us vouchers for 4 free meals.  As we were heading out, she also gave us a bag of cookies (an excellent distraction in the car for hungry kids) and apologized again for everything. She went well beyond what I would have expected and ensured we had a positive experience overall. It’s nice to see that some places/people understand the importance of owning up to mistakes and making things right. ",

I realized she was using her calculator, I just kinda mumbled \"it's  $2.\" She didn't hear me,  But her manager saw her on her phone, stopped to see why, couldn't figure it out either, got on his phone to subtract $18.37 from $20.37.  I really hate amt tend buttons!  \n\nEDIT: First,  I have been a cashier.  Many times ~30 years. I've spent many years counting money.   \n\nI had eye contact with her when I said \"hang on I have the change.\"  I understand having a bad day, but the worst part was when her manager pulled out his calculator too!

        "text": "So, a few months ago my boyfriend and I decided to switch to a prepaid carrier because they were having a special on two lines for $80 a month unlimited, which would save both of us some money on our phone bill. Now, we both have unlocked phones purchased directly from the manufacturer as factory unlocked, AND I was already using my factory unlocked phone with the parent company of this prepaid service, so I knew our phones would work on the network. \n\nSo, we get to the store and they have two salespeople working. One of them is with a rather large group so obviously, he couldn't help us, and another is just wrapping up helping some customers. Obviously, I didn't hear their whole conversation but I could hear the saleswoman adamantly saying that she couldn't help these people and they had to do something online. I didn't think anything of it at first. I work two jobs in retail and food service so I know companies sometimes do have stupid policies and just chalked it up to that, but in actuality, it was a red flag.\n\nEventually, it is our turn and my boyfriend and I walk up to the counter, we let her know that we would like to sign up for the two lines for $80 plan. Everything is going fine, she seems a little irritated but I thought maybe she had a long day, whatever. Anyway, she starts asking about which phones in the store we'd like to buy and that's when the trouble started.\n\nMe \"Oh no, we're looking to bring our phones. They're both factory unlocked so it shouldn't be an issue.\"\n\nHer \"Yeah, well a lot of people say their phones are unlocked and they don't end up working. This $80 is nonrefundable, you know\" \n\nMe \"I'm willing to take that risk, I'm currently using this phone with company X, and its the same network so I don't see why it wouldn't work\"\n\nHer \"Oh, you're using it with Company X? Well, then they've automatically locked it. They lock it as soon as you put that sim in there and then you can't use it with anything else.\"\n\nMe \"I've used this phone with multiple companies without an issue. Do you at least have a sim card in the store that you can put into the phone double check if my phone will work?\" \n\nHer \"Oh that isn't something we do.\"\n\nAt this point, I just leave due to frustration. I'm not a cell phone genius but I knew she was wrong. So my boyfriend and I decided to go to the next closest store about 20 minutes away. Not only did they not make an issue about our unlocked phones, BUT they also had a store sim card that they put in our phones just to double check that there wouldn't be any issues and we were out of there in about 15 minutes. The people at this new store also informed us that the store we originally went to is notorious for bad service.\n\nThis was the only time that I actually submitted a formal complaint to corporate, I just don't understand flat out refusing to do your job.",

        "text": "Hello TFTC! Finally got a story to share here and I'm kinda proud of this one. Also, I'm on mobile and English isn't my first language so please don't kill me.\n\n\nI bought an older car a few months ago (the car's about 18 years old) and had it checked by my stepdad, who worked as a car mechanic for a few years. He told me that the pollen filter has to be replaced, so I set up an appointment at a mechanic to do so. But before I went there, I let my stepdad put a small sticker on the pollen filter.\n\n\nSo I went there, left my car and walked home. They call me a few hours later, that the filter is changed and I could come get my car. The mechanic who worked on my car handed me the bill. \n\n\nMechanic: That will be 40 euros.\n\nMe: Alright, but I'd like to take my old pollen filter home with me.\n\n\nHe seems a bit startled, dashes off and hands me \"my old pollen filter\". Which didn't have the sticker on it. And the sticker was very well placed at the filter so it could've not fallen off. \n\n\nMe: No, this isn't my old pollen filter. It had a sticker on it. You probably didn't do anything to my car and now want to charge me for something you didn't do. \n\n\nI was calmer than I thought I would be. The mechanic lost all colour in his face and suddenly went silent. He offered me a free oil change, which I gladly accepted. I didn't have to pay a thing and I definately won't go to this mechanic ever again.\n\n\nEDIT: Since many people don't seem to get it: My stepfather didn't change the filter himself since he didn't have a new filter on hand and didn't feel like ordering a new one. Which is why he sent me to the mechanic, who had the filter I needed.\n\nNot everyone has goddamn new pollen filters at home, guys.",

Now, I could have stopped at their competion, but eff that, I worked there for two and a half years and have had easily a thousand of their nuggets. \n\nI got to the store at about 11:40, walked in because I hate going through drive through. There were two people waiting for their food, so I got in front of the register and waited. And waited. And waited. And for the love of fry grease I freaking waited! ... for eight minutes. \n\nNot ONE employee looked at any of us. They said nothing to us. They didn't even breathe a bit in our direction to show us that they knew we were there. Well, besides the manager asking for someone to come up front. To their credit, someone did, but the girl didn't even look at us and just kept joking with the guys in back, saying they didn't know how to make a sandwich and \"helping\" in drive through (watching the other two people work is more accurate).\n\nNow, I may have only worked customer service for about three and a half years, but in that time I have learned a lot. For example, never flat out ignore your customers. Always give them at least a little greeting saying you'll be there in a minute. Apologize for the wait.\n\nI am usually a patient person, but after straining both my calf muscles (flat feet with no insoles...I have learned my lesson), and just being able to walk with minimal pain again, and just getting off of a shift, I was tired and hungry and wanted to get home. I should have been in that place and out in eight minutes or so. \n\nI would never treat my customers like this. I always greet my customers as soon as they walk in the door or at least when they get to the register, especially on slow periods. I get drive through is priority, I understand higher ups breathing down your neck to shave seconds off the time, I understand that working this kind of job is frustrating and hard, but that is no reason to flat out ignore a customer. \n\nI know I probably sound like an entitled brat right now, but I have never been flat out ignored by employees. Forgoten about? Sure, it happens. But being seen then completely ignored? Unacceptable. \n\nI'm done ranting here, just needed to get this off my chest. I'll be calling the store and talking to the manager tomorrow about my experience with their \"service\" tonight. If anything interesting happens I'll leave an update in the comments. \n\nBut for now...I really wish I could have gotten those precious nuggs. I'll have to get some tomorrow, and pray I'm not ignored. ",

Heading home from the gym, dad asks me to pick up some groceries so I stop there at the generic supermarket.\n\nI usually use self checkout when I only get a few items. Now at this supermarket, it just got redone, and now, half of the self checkouts are card only. I presume this is for easiness when they have to empty them.\n\nAnyway, I've been there enough to know which side is the card only, and which ones take cash. Even if you don't know which ones take cash, if it doesn't, **it will give you a big notification saying \"This machine is card only\" kind of thing and you have to tap OK before it lets you do anything else.**\n\n I walk up to the self checkouts when I see a mess taking place. Two Hispanic women in their 20s with about 7 kids running around, grabbing and throwing shit, and the parents doing nothing to stop them, and are fixated on checking in their 50+ items. \n\nI walk past over to the cash self checkouts when they call the self checkout monitor lady over whose like a women in her 50s. They immediately start screaming at her \"WHAT DO YOU MEAN I CANT USE CASH?! DO YOU NOT WANT MY MONEY? WHY DOESNT THIS WORK? WHY DO I HAVE TO GO TO A DIFFERENT ONE.\" \n\nAt this point I'm thinking \"holy shit what is their deal\". The lady was doing everything she could to help, offering to run it through the one she monitors from but the women were still yelling. \"YOU GET PAID TO SIT HERE AND DO NOTHING THIS IS YOUR JOB YOU SHOULD DO IT RIGHT\". \n\nWhile she was setting it up on her self checkout that she monitors from, right by mine, I looked over and laughed and shook my head, to show that I was laughing at how rude they were. She leaned over to me and said, \"See you get to say what you want and don't have to worry about what you say because you don't have one of these\" and pointed to her uniform and laughed. I gave her a smile before she returned to dealing with them.\n\nI don't see why people choose to treat workers like shit despite their occupation. \nSelf checkout lady, if you're out there I hope you don't have to deal with that every day.",

        "text": "HERE WE ARE BOYS AND GIRLS WITH A FABULOUS FUCKED STORY I DIDN’T REALIZE WAS MESSED UP UNTIL TODAY.\nSo grab your drinks, snacks, and sit back for the story of my Good Clips disaster.\n\nNow I don’t know if this hair cutting place is international or not, so let me set the scene. I’m from a (busy-ish but not super known) town with multiple Good Clips (casual name change). For anyone who doesn’t know what I’m talking about, it’s basically the Golden M of haircuts. Huge franchise, multiple stores nation wide (as far as I’m aware) etc.\n\nIt also sucks.\n\nI’ve met a couple people there who are absolutely brilliant, but overall it’s...fairly unreliable. But cheap. So I’ve spent years withstanding sub-par hair cuts due to price. Not fun.\n\nBut I digress, my actual story is set several months ago. I’ve been struggling with gender dysphoria (something I’m rather sensitive about and try to keep secret) for most of my life. After many years of wanting it done, and despite insistants that it wouldn’t look good on me, I finally decided to cut all of my hair off. It was severely damaged anyways after years of constant hair dye and bleaching, so no harm no foul, right?\n\nNope.\n\nI went into that store with the $12 I had to my name. I was terrified, going from hair down to my waist to above my chin. But all I could hope for was the relief. For the hairdresser to just do her goddamn job. Instead what I got was a “HAHA NOPE FUCK YOU”\n\nSo I walk into this store visibly terrified, clutching my money, and quietly give a young girl at the register my name. I’m set up with who I thought was a nice lady, and would be good at her job (hair dye, etc). I sat down in the chair, and told her exactly what I wanted. I wanted all of my hair gone. I watched in the mirror as she made a face, and messed with my hair some.\n\nIn verbatim, this is how the conversation went.\n\nHer: What were you thinking?\nMe: I really want it cut short. Just really short, sort of layered. Not a bob.\nHer: Mmm.\nMe: Kind of like a see your manager haircut, but not. \nHer: Okay. Uh. Are you sure?\nMe: Um...yes?\nShe clicked her tongue, continuing to mess with my hair. She looks at me in the mirror.\nHer: I don’t think it’ll look good.\n\nExcuse me what\n\nMe: What???\nHer: Your hair is two-toned. I won’t be able to see the layers, and even if I do the ends will be orange. It won’t look good. It’s your hair, and if you want it I’ll do it, but I’m warning you now.\n\nAs a result of trying to let my hair grow out, and the damage out with it, a couple inches from my roots were dirty blonde, whilst the rest was a frizzy strawberry blonde. Besides isn’t it her job to know...how to cut hair???\n\nMe: I just really want it short.\nHer: Have you tried styling it? \nShe lifts up my hair as if to show me.\n\nMe: That’s not what I want- I want it /gone/. I hate the feeling of it against my neck.\n\nHer: You could always put it in a ponytail.\n\n\nAt the end of the appointment, I left in tears with nothing done. \n\nJokes on her, I got my hair cut for free two nights later. In my own bathroom. With plastic scissors.\n\nGot it fixed later on, but...yeah. \nFuck that place, guys.\n",

        "text": "Hot off the press, this happened to me half an hour ago.\n\nI live and work in a major CBD location, as in my job is a 10 minute walk from my home.  I always give myself enough time to stop somewhere and get a coffee and takeaway breakfast on my way to work.  Today I went to a place I'd been to a heap of times before and never had any issues with.\n\nUsually there's a lovely bubbly chatty girl who works the coffee counter.  She remembers me, always remembering my order slightly wrong (not a big deal), I get a soy flat white and she always thinks it's a soy latte.\n\nAnyway.  She isn't there today.  Which is obviously not a big deal because people get sick and need holidays and a hundred other things.  Anyway.  New Guy I have never seen here before.  So he's either usually works in the main restaurant (rather than the coffee cart), or he's completely new at the location.  \n\nI order a small soy flat white and a ham and cheese croissant.  He asks me if I would like it toasted.  I respond in the affirmative.  He goes about his job.\n\nI get to the office with my breakfast goodies and sit down at my desk.  I like to eat breaky and drink my coffee while I go through my e-mails and get my to-do list for the day sorted.  That kind of thing.  \n\nOpen the bag to get my croissant and realise immediately is has tomato on it.  Ham, cheese and tomato croissants are pretty common in my area, so this has happened to me before.  I'm not allergic, I just don't like warm tomato, so it's not a big deal.  I open the croissant to take the tomato out which is when I realise that the cheese isn't even a little melted.  Not even sweating.  Which is when I realise that the croissant isn't even warm.  So even though he specifically asked me if I wanted it toasted, he hadn't actually toasted it.  Strike 2.\n\nI'm annoyed at this point, but it's all fixable.  I remove the tomato and pop it in the toaster oven at work.  Get back to my desk, have a bite of croissant.  Yum.  Have a sip of coffee.  Fucking YUCK!!\n\nThis guy has given me full cream milk.  Even though I asked for soy.  I am lactose intolerant.  Even that one mouthful is going to give me an upset stomach later.  Now I'm really annoyed because this guys inattention is going to result in me feeling sick and that's seriously uncool.  So I call the coffee stand and complain (I didn't go back because I had a 9am phone meeting that was due to start in 5 minutes).\n\nI try to keep myself level, but I'm sure my irritation comes through.  I tell the person who answers the phone what I asked for and what I got.  I say that New Guy got literally every part of my order is wrong, and that I'm lactose intolerant so that mistake is of particular concern to me.  To his credit, the person on the phone does apologise and tell me he'll pass the feedback on to New Guy, he also offers to replace the order for free if I go back the next day.  \n\nI don't need a free order, that wasn't the reason for the call, but I just won't take them up on it when I go there next and I just won't go there again if my only option is to be served by New Guy.  \n\nI understand people make mistakes, but fucking up three things on the same order that only had two items is a level of fucking up that's just not understandable anymore.  Customers trust people in the hospitality industry with their food and their dietary requirements.  We trust them not to make a mistake that could cause us actual literal harm.  That was the reason for the call because clearly New Guy, for whatever reason, cannot be trusted with that and I think that's something management should be aware of.\n\nETA: Lactose intolerance is *not the same* as a dairy allergy.  \n\n&gt;Lactose is a sugar, so if you check the ingredients on a dairy product and it has no sugar it's safe for a lactose intolerant person to eat.\n\n&gt; In order to process the lactose sugar, your body uses an enzyme called lactase. People who are lactose intolerant don't have enough lactase to break down the lactose correctly and it then makes them sick. This also means that some lactose intolerant people can still consume small amounts of lactose. This is because they just have a reduced amount of lactase enzymes, so there is still a way for the body to break down the lactose, but eating too much lactose will still make that person sick.\n\n&gt; You can see this even with people who don't have a lactose allergy. My boyfriend's boss recently had 3 lattes before midday, ate a creamy pasta for lunch and then got his team milkshakes in the afternoon as a bit of a reward for doing good work. He went home feeling sick because he'd consumed more lactose in his day than his lactase enzymes were able to process.",

I was having rapid fire pop ups come up all over my browser, new toolbars, rapid redirects, all 10-15 minutes after opening any browser. It preventing me from doing anything including closing them.\n\n I don’t even access anything remotely questionable on my work computer so it had me baffled why I was getting what I was getting. We’re pretty much on IT lockdown anyway. \n\nAll I could do is get to task manager to close out the browser. \n\nOur local IT tech never got back to me when I put in a ticket. \n\nSo, I put in a support ticket under general. \n\nI go, eat, and deal with backed up paperwork while I’m waiting. \n\nI get the email \n\n“Support Ticket (######)\n\nStatus: Resolved \n\nComments: Unable to reproduce issue in remote access, no issues with browsing in any browser for several minute.

I do, he opens a browser and goes to get a coffee to wait.

        "text": "I was reading tales from the front desk because as someone who has worked various service and customer service jobs I like the commiseration. But! It reminded me of this story.\n\nAfter my divorce I saved up for two years to go on a solo trip to London. It was supposed to be a “get my groove back” trip in which I would flirt and sleep with hot British men (preferably Tom Hiddleston) but as fate would have it I met my boyfriend two weeks before and it turned into “get my museum groove back” trip. \n\nRegardless. I was there was for 10 days and had booked an affordable hotel right in the Chalk farm neighborhood. Just a tad sketchy but next to a tube station, small grocery, and Camden Locke market. \n\nIt was summer and A/C was not a thing in that hotel so I slept in with the windows open every night and with the exception of night 8 the room next to me was unoccupied. Which was great because those walls were as thin as tissue paper. \n\nThe hotel, for the most part, was great. No frills, but just what I needed. Until the infamous night 8. \n\nI’m awoken at 1:47 (I checked) am to the dulcet sounds of a drunk couple arguing in the room next to mine. Not paying too much attention I try to block it out with a pillow over my head but as I said the walls are tissue paper thin and my window (and theirs) are open. \n\nThe whole argument is about a lost passport and the guy is getting more and more aggressive in his language. The woman is giving it back to him with more slurring than he is and I’m whimpering out of annoyance to go to sleep. Suddenly I hear the sound of glass shattering and wood cracking. I sit up wondering if the woman just got hit only to hear her unleash a torrent of abuse on him for being an over dramatic asshole and that they will get “charged” for that. \n\nFiguring she was ok and only property was damaged I hunkered down to wait out the argument. \n\nI was 29 years old. A woman with the grace and self defense know-how of a stretch Armstrong . In a foreign country, tucked into a blind corridor of the hotel with my room and Mr and Mrs Drunk’s room the only two in said corridor. I wasn’t about to call down to the front desk over a broken mirror when my phone call would definitely be heard through the walls that at this point I’m convinced we’re made of popsicle sticks and paint. \n\nThe couple left about 30 minutes later and I went back to bed. \n\nThe next morning I tell the front desk what happened and they send someone up who confirms that the vanity mirror and one of the vanity’s drawers is completely shattered and cracked. \n\nIt was here that the front desk man looked at me and angrily (in the quiet British way) said \n“Why did you not call down to us when this happened?! You should have reported this immediately!”\n\nI explained the whole woman alone thing and he just shakes his head. \n“You could have done something. You had a responsibility to inform us.”\n\nTo which I said “a responsibility to inform you of a broken mirror that would not have become unbroken had I started shit with a clearly drunk and violent man in a room that is not mine?”\n\nThe guy just pursed his lips and sniffed at me before getting on the phone to housekeeping or maintenance or whatever.\n\nLike I get it. Were it any other hotel where I felt safe in my anonymity and ability to not have a drunk guy crawl through my screenless window (we were on top of a roof ledge) or break the old fashioned lock with no deadbolt had he heard my complaint then yes I would have but I don’t think I should have put my safety in danger for a cheap hotel mirror.

        "text": "WORTH THE READ!\n\nI hope this is the right place to post this.\n\nBackground: My friend was getting married and getting her bridal makeup done. She is Pakistani, I am white. She got her makeup done at a salon run out of a woman’s basement. The makeup artist and hairstylist are both Pakistani and they all speak Urdu. They were mostly conversing between themselves in Urdu and spoke to me in English. I am used to this as I am around my friend and her family all the time. The time of the wedding was 7 pm. Let's call my friend Emma, makeup artist MA, friend’s sister Rachel, other sister Heather, and friend’s mom Ruby.\n\nDay of the incident: I arrive about 10 minutes after they did and my friend was already in the chair, starting to get her makeup done. It was around 1:10pm. I greeted everyone, including the makeup artist, and complemented the work. I go around the curtain (halfway pulled, separating the makeup area from the rest of the room) and sit on the couch and talk Rachel. We are having a good time talking. About an hour in, I ask Rachel, Heather and Ruby if they are hungry. I offer to pick up food because I am not getting my hair nor makeup done there, doing it myself. They said they are starving. So I go over to Emma and ask if she is hungry as well. Then I ask MA if it was alright if I brought food in. She said of course, the bride needs to eat. (She had snacks all around so I assumed before that she was okay with us eating.) I go out, get the food, bring it back and we eat. We clean up all of our stuff as well. \nIn order to make this post shorter, I will just post the review on her page, which sums up the events. \n\n“Friend of the bride here. Let me start off by saying the makeup was pretty. But she took too long. The bride was supposed to be at her wedding at 7. We did not leave until 7:30. This woman took 20 minutes to take her own pictures. After I said we had to leave, she said okay, then proceeded to take more pictures. My friend is too nice of a person to say something.\n\nShe gave my friend blue contacts, then charged her. Did not ask if she wanted them. Then after she complained that they hurt and she couldn’t see (she needs a prescription), she told her that was normal and she can’t take them out because it would ruin her makeup.\n\nShe also micromanaged the hair dresser and belittlered her.\n\nWhen the sister of the bride suggested that the lipstick on the bride might not be the right shade, she was rude to her. She was also rude to the mother.\n\nShe had the makeup artist move me to another part of the room because having me watch messed her up.\n\nShe was nice enough to let us bring food in and eat.\n\nAfter reading her other comments on unsatisfactory posts, I notice she said they are not happy with their marriage or they were paid or something. This is 100% true.  I’m sure she will say I am lying or we were very satisfied at the time or said nothing then. We are satisfied with the makeup. Just not the treatment.”\n\n\nThis is some of her replies on google to other unsatisfactory reviews:\n\n“Your face was full of acne. Such a severe one that no one will touch it. Face full of oil…. I will not show anger or any emotions…. Now posting all your before (without makeup) and after pictures on SOCIAL MEDIA…. That will do justice. We promise 4 hrs.”\n\n“Shazia Rashid wife of (Wajih); from Canada, your hateful angry writing suggests you are not happy with your wedding &amp; married life. Sorry!!”\n\n\nThe next day I get the follow text from Emma, saying it was from MA:\n\n“Matter went to my parents attention. They r born most naik people. They hv not missed Tahajjud ever in their life. \n\nNaima single hard working lady versus all women living with parents and loving husbands. Your American friend. Bitch and your selfish sister. Watch within one month what will happen to both. One car accident one divorce can change your whole life. That ugly American bitch earns points for rating business. She must belong to most poor family. I educated family. She has to sit at studio for 6 to 7 hrs. Obviously she was jealous &amp; has anger. She felt left out. You as smart &amp; God fearing can’t convince to remove the review. Instead of reviewing me 5. This is the slap you all gave me. Islam teaches if one slap you give them other side to be slapped. What did I do to you girls. Every word she wrote is wrong. Bitch can’t even review me without getting services. Discussing with lawyer presenting. Review will be gone once she receive papers to appear in court for hate review. \n\nBut I sued for coming to studio without my permission. Observing my practice and writing lies on my makeup business page. Bitch will be in jail for few days. InshaAllah. May she dies in Car accident.\n\n\nAllah is great. He will answer each of my prayer.”\n\n(note: the first part is her talking about what great Muslims her parents are. IinshaAllah means “god willing.”) \n\nNot going to lie, it made me cry. What kind of horrible person wishes someone would die in a car accident, just for writing a bad review on her page.\n\nI posted her response onto a group chat with people from the wedding. They’re reactions are what you expect. The most common comment was how this gives Muslims a bad rep and how un-Muslim it is to say such things.\n\nSo naturally I post her reply to my review on her page with the following note: “My whole goal was to educate other brides before spending money and time on their big day. Not to be mean. I just did not want someone else to have the same bad experience.”\n\nShe texted my friend again: \n“You hv no idea how much I cried\nHow bad is my migraine\nSo many clients came today\nI told everyone how you guys treated me\nI will definitely speak to your dad once\nYou all are cruel\n\nWe all are sane (i think she means same because she certainly is not sane)\nI work with hands\nDid you once feel that i didn’t treat you good\nNo makeup artist exchange this many messages\nThey don’t answer phone calls\nI told you about each and everything you should get to look the best\n\nYou couldn’t even write me thank you note (this all went done literally in the middle of the wedding festivities, one a 3 day long even, so Emma had no time whatsoever to sleep, let alone write a thank you card)\n\nI clearly told you that these contacts can make you look pretty for few hours (Emma is so nice and uncomfortable with confrontation that she wouldn’t say anything if the woman doing her makeup said she should wear the contacts)\nI wished you gotten your own lenses\nWhere did I go wrong.\nHow can I just apply lenses without someone’s consent\nYou r first one who has vision issues (no shit, she wears glasses, cant just pur in random contacts, needs prescription)\nMost don’t \nOr they bring their own\nOr they wear at home &amp; come to me\nWe are professional people\nEvery single bride wears contacts\nWe only advise what’s good for you\nAnd let’s hope that Allah serve the justice that whole world will watch. Complete faith on Allah.\n\nShe is evil witch at 18 (im 22)\n\nOlder age she will become killer. Abuser. Terrorist. May be prostitution. Robber. Worse human being i ever met. And I will repeat over &amp; over if your sister is involve which i she is 100%. Same wishes for her. Not scared a bit. Evil disgusting girls. Full of hate\n\nAnyone who has anger problem, needs mental help &amp; they bother need to go to jail. Let court decide\n\nDid she write this review with your permission?????” (100% with her permission)\n\n\n\nTLDR: makeup artist was totally unprofessional during service, went way over time and caused bride to be 45 minutes late. I write bad review, she calls me a bitch and hopes I die in car accident.\n",

My fiance and I chatted a little about another kit I spotted, and whether or not I ought to buy it when I saw the old woman in front of us carefully stacking her coupons.\n\nThe hair on the back of my neck stood up, and I just knew something was going to go wrong. She had two booklets of coupons, one in her name and one in her companion's name. \n\n\"Ma'am,\" the cashier said pleasantly. \"I can't run two fifty percent off coupons. I can run one fifty and one forty, if you'd like.\"\n\n\"Whaaaaat? Why?\" the woman demanded.\n\n\"Because that's policy, and it's the one stated on the coupons.\"\n\n\"Well, they ARE in different names! One is mine and one is her,\" she jerked her head to her friend.\n\n\"I am sorry, but I can run a sixty percent off. Or I can do the fifty percent and the forty percent.\" \n\nI felt myself dying a little inside. For the record, I thought it was generous to offer the fifty and the forty. That's still a pretty heft sum off your bill.\n\n\"Well that's just bullshit.\" the lady thundered. \"You should honor my coupons exactly the way I want them honored.\" she paused for a minute and smiled slyly. \"How about a sixty percent and a forty percent?\"\n\n\"Again, ma'am, no. We can't do that.\" the cashier was beginning to look frustrated, and the line was beginning to murmur. \n\n\"Fine! I just want THIS!\" the woman slammed down her knitting needles. \"It shouldn't be a big deal, but here we are. Now, apply my sixty percent off coupon.\"\n\nThe cashier scanned the coupon and opened her mouth to give a total.\n\n\"WAIT! I'll just make two separate purchases. Scan my fifty percent off.\" the cashier voided the order, scanned the fifty percent off, completed the transaction for the needles, and then scanned her yarn and gave a total.\n\"I can't believe what you make me go through to use my own coupons that you sent me.\"\n\nShe swiped her card in anger and glared at the cashier. The cashier tossed out the little page of coupons, which she shouldn't have done, I admit. The lady screeched.\n\n\"I want the REST of those coupons!\" the cashier fished it out and began to tear out the used coupon. \"What are you doing!?!?\"\n\n\"We have to turn in this coupon.\" the cashier said tightly. \n\n\"Well, just cross it out.\" the woman snarled. The cashier shook her head. \"You're destroying the rest of my coupons. Where's my receipt?\"\n\n\"You didn't complete the transaction on the pin pad.\" the lady slammed a button, snatched her receipt and the rest of her coupons and stormed out.\n\nI put down my yarn and smiled at the cashier, who apologized for my wait. Coupons! A pretty big deal!",

        "text": "This is not the usual type of story we hear around here, so I apologize if it seems a little out of place. I figure since I'm in the US and we have to pay for a college education here, I'm still a customer. Now to the story:\n\nI started grad school in January to become a teacher at one of my state's universities (SU). Last year, the governor of my state said that all the state universities needed to make a program to help teachers get through the school debt free, but they had the freedom to design how that program would work. My SU first started out with a scholarship supported by private donors that you had to write an essay to get. I got it. The only rules at the time were that you had to continue getting professional development and teach in a state school when you graduated, otherwise you would lose the \"support\" they would give you for two years. That was it. You wouldn't have to pay it back ever.\n\nWell, this summer they decided to change things up. My summer classes started around May 15th, and I was supposed to have all my financial aid before then. However, the SU upper management people decided that they were going to change the scholarship from a private donor thing to a school-funded tuition and fee waiver. (It was already basically a tuition and fee waiver; this just changed where the money was coming from.) Unfortunately, this also meant that there were going to be strings attached and there was going to be a contract to sign. And they couldn't make up their minds fast enough about what would be on the contract. They changed things several times:\n\n* Oh, this won't be for summer students. This new policy will start in the fall.\n* Actually, it will be for summer students.\n* You'll get the contract by the end of the first week of classes.\n* You should get it by next Friday.\n* Pretty sure it's coming on Wednesday.\n* Maybe this Friday for sure.\n* Basically any day now.\n* Oh here it is: *on a Tuesday, three weeks after class had begun*.\n\nBy the time I got the contract, I was desperate for funds. I scanned it over and saw how much they were screwing us, but I didn't care at that point. If I didn't need the money immediately, I would've told them to forget the whole thing ages ago. So I signed, and I was told that the money would be posted to my account by the end of that week.\n\n...it was not posted until ten days later. So for those of you at home keeping track, that's **four weeks after class began** before the scholarship was even acknowledged by the financial aid office of SU. My summer classes are only six weeks long.\n\nBut wait! The saga is not over yet!\n\nBecause the scholarship was so long in coming, SU used my other financial aid, including loans and the TEACH grant, to pay for my tuition and fees. The scholarship is supposed to only be used to pay for tuition and fees, so logically, they should have removed the loans (which they had to adjust anyway, because apparently I was \"over\" the maximum allowed financial aid for the summer when my scholarship came in), apply they scholarship, and then reapply the loan and send me the excess in a refund.\n\nWell guess what? If you guessed that that's not what happened, you get a prize! Not from me though, because *I still don't have any money!*\n\nWhen the scholarship was posted to my account, it said I now owed $716 to the SU. Which didn't make any sense, since I now had MORE financial aid, not less, even with the adjustment to my loan. I called last Monday and was told it was still \"processing\". I called again on Wednesday when nothing had changed, and had a conversation that went something like this. SUR is State University Representative.\n\nMe: Hi, my scholarship was applied late, but I think it went through wrong, because it's saying that I owe $716 now and I should be getting a refund. I know they readjusted my loan but I'm still getting something back.\n\nSUR: Well if they adjusted the loan, you can always submit a readjustment form for them to fix it.\n\nMe: No, I was told I was over the max, so that's not going to do anything. I just want the money I have coming to me.\n\nSUR: This says you have $716 owed. But if you submit the readjustment form we could see if you could get any more money.\n\nMe: I don't want to do that because I know it would be denied and pointless. I just want to sort out why I'm not getting the money I already have.\n\nSUR: Ah yes, if you are over your maximum for the summer, then you will not be allowed to have more loans.\n\n*At this point I was very frustrated with this circular conversation and became a bit short.*\n\nMe: Look. I have something like $7000-$8000 in financial aid. My fees for the summer only add up to \\~$5000. I should be getting money *back*, not owing more.\n\nFinally she got it, and to her credit she was as helpful as she could possibly be after that point. There was a lot of holding while she talked to someone more in the know than her, and eventually I was transferred to that person. The end verdict was that because my scholarship could only be applied to tuition and fees, the refund was just \"sitting there\" because my loan had already paid for the tuition and fees. SUR #2 told me that they would need to communicate with a few other departments to see if they could sort it out.\n\nThat was last Wednesday. It's now Saturday, and my account still says I owe $716. No refund in sight. I am hoping beyond hope that this can all get rectified on Monday because SU only issues refunds on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Oh, and guess what? My class ends on Tuesday. I'm literally going to be finished taking the class before I ever see the money that was supposed to help pay for it.\n\nThis whole thing is very wearying for me, and I just needed somewhere to vent. Not SU's fault, but my dad also lost his job a week ago, and he was the primary breadwinner in the family, so I am even more desperately in need of funds than I was before. The stress has been unreal. Thanks for reading though!\n\nP.S. In case anyone was wondering, the scholarship contract now states that if I do not teach in a state school after graduation, the amount of the scholarship will have to be paid back in full. Also, if I go below full time, I will be disqualified. This last point is frustrating for me because I'm switching from the regular master's program to one that allows me to teach at the same time, and the way the classes are laid out means I'll have at least one semester, if not a whole year, where I may be disqualified for the scholarship.",

        "text": "FTP, sorry for the length, blah, blah, &amp; etc.\n\nThis story comes from just a few months ago. I tried to shorten it as best I could, but I think you’ll enjoy. TL;DR at end.\n\nSome necessary background. I’m a high school teacher at a very small, non-traditional school. Our kids have a local reputation for being very well-behaved—seriously. Anytime we take them on trips, bus drivers, business owners, staff…just about everyone compliments us and them on how polite and considerate they are. But, they are still teenagers, so they’re a little quirky. And weird. And…well, they’re kids. On top of that, our school’s culture is very, *very* conservative, so a lot of these kids are kind of sheltered and just a touch naïve.\n\nSo, I and this other teacher (OT) decide that, at the end of a field trip to the museum, it would be fun to stop off at this quirky little doughnut shop before we head back to the school. But, being the considerate humans that we are, we are only going to do this if (1) they are cool with it and (2) we come up with a plan to make it work quickly and easily. We call the place ahead of time and speak to the manager (M), and he’s a super nice guy. They’re totally down with the idea; we discuss options, wait times, arrival times, expectations, etc. Once the details are in place, we let the students know what to expect (and what we expect of them), and they seem pretty happy about it. Fun times, right?\n\nCut to day of. The doughnut shop is in a busy part of town, and it’s pretty small, so we have to park the buses a few blocks away and walk. We find a place to park the buses, then OT and I start to organize the kids onto sidewalks walking toward the shop. (The other chaperones stay on the bus.) The manager is standing outside to greet us since we’d called on our way there. We all wait for all the kids to gather around so that they can get instructions from the manager on being good customers.\n\n&gt;M: Hi, guys! Welcome to DoughnutShop! We’re super excited you guys are here. We’ve got these lines all roped out for you, and remember it’s cash only. Since the line is going to go outside the store, please be careful to keep these doors closed at all times to keep the goodness sealed inside. (obligatory *\\*ha ha\\**) If you can just have your order ready as quickly as possible and your money out, that would be a big help. Okay, let’s do this!\n\nAt this point, OT and I split up: me at the back of the line outside and her inside kind of in the middle. Throughout the whole process, OT and I are especially impressed about our kids’ behavior. They got right in line. They had their money out. They said “excuse me” to the customers in the store. They said “please” and “thank you” to staff. They even remembered to keep the damn doors closed. And the staff was absolutely fabulous, of course, and just so much fun to chat with. I was really just super happy that the kids got to participate in a real-world moment where we could reinforce good manners and just generally being good customers.\n\nNow, here’s the moment where I tell you that, leading up to the field trip, the kids were super excited about going to the doughnut shop. Like, really excited. I mean, I wasn’t expecting them to really care about the museum so much, but…doughnuts? Really? AND…here’s the moment where I describe the doughnut shop. It’s in a super eclectic part of town, painted funky colors, with doughnuts of all shapes and sizes advertised: stars, people, hearts, etc. These are not weird details on their own, but they matter in a minute.\n\nI’m watching everyone come out of the store: our students and other patrons. And what I’m noticing is that, while the other patrons are getting their doughnuts in bags, boxes, wrappers, etc., our kids are only coming out with one thing: giant, pink boxes. This is kind of weird to me. Also, as they’re walking out, they’re grouping around these boxes, giggling, snapping pictures, and generally stumbling their way back to the buses while staring like morons into the box. Now, I can’t see what’s in the boxes from my vantage point, but I’ve decided it’s time to take a look. By the time I get to the doors, I run into a group of students I know well with a girl in the middle clutching one of these pink boxes. She’s a classic one of our kids: sweet, kind, and sheltered.\n\n&gt;ME: \\*taking the direct approach\\* Whatcha got there?\n\nShe is hesitating, but she knows me, and she knows this is only going to end one way…and that way is most definitely mine. Everybody is watching us, and it’s super quiet. So, the girl takes kind of a funny breath and opens the box.\n\nThere, in the giant pink box, is a perfectly shaped doughnut dick.\n\nWHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK.\n\n&gt;ME: \\*aloud\\* …well, huh.\n\nSo, I’m looking at this thing, and it’s just how you’d imagine it. The cock part is some kind of enormous chocolate éclair, and the balls are round, cream-filled (YES!!!) pastries. And it’s fucking big. And it’s kind of just looking back at me. And everyone is silent. And the girl has tears forming in her eyes, probably thinking I’m going to chew her ass out right here in the street. So, I just sort of sigh, and I attempt to speak calmly to her as if nothing out of the ordinary is happening.\n\n&gt;ME: Go ahead back to the bus, and be careful crossing the street.\n\nAnd as they are walking away, I turn away from the line of students, and as soundlessly as I can possibly manage…I just fucking laugh.\n\nApparently, what happened was the students had looked up the doughnut shop online and found one of their more quirky (and expensive, actually) pastries, so they all decided to order it, of course. I guess this plan had been circulating for weeks ahead of the field trip, all while carefully passing around pictures of these dick-shaped wonders. Knowing our kids, a “rebellion” of this magnitude had to be carefully planned ahead of time. I shudder to think of what exists on social media, and really, I don’t want to know.\n\nBut, the way I found out about this really wasn’t the best story. That story belongs to OT, and I’ll tell that quickly now. OT, remember, is inside the shop, standing kind of in the middle and making sure that the kids are behaving as they order. Like me, she’s proud of them, even more so because she gets to see a lot of the interactions first hand. However, and this is important, she’s still far away enough from the cash register that she can’t see or hear clearly what they’re ordering. She’s only catching snippets of things, and what she sees, like what the staff tells her later, is that they kids are doing a great job of behaving.\n\nSo, about half of the kids have placed and received their orders, and OT is hanging back, watching it all go down, when the manager approaches from the back to stand on the shop floor. Of course, OT is immediately worried. Have the kids done something she hasn’t seen? Well, maybe not. The manager has a HUGE smile on his face, and he’s kind of shaking his head a little bit in a funny way.\n\nThe manager stands there, hands crossed over his apron, his big friendly voice booming as he talks over the crowd.\n\n&gt;M: LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, CAN I HAVE YOUR ATTENTION?\n\nOur kids settle down immediately, attention rapt. Everyone is looking at the manager. His smile is, I’m given to understand, state-wide by this point.\n\n&gt;M: LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I’M SORRY TO ANNOUNCE…BUT WE ARE OFFICIALLY OUT OF THE COCK AND BALLS!!!\n\nTL;DR: Students on a field trip go to a doughnut shop; they behave, but their orders get a little…cocky…\n\nEDITED: grammar/spelling",

        "text": "I'm a woman, and at the time this occurred I was probably in my early to mid twenties. I'd recently moved to a new city and was having trouble with my car. I don't remember what exactly as this was at least ten years ago, but I want to say it was the radiator. When I dropped the car off I made sure they'd call before doing any work as it way dying and I was planning to replace it within the year. It didn't make sense to spend too much on the jalopy. \n\nWhen the mechanic called back they confirmed it was the radiator and that I would need to get it replaced. When I heard the cost of a new part I asked what a rebuilt part would cost. The reply? \"Oh, we don't do rebuilt parts here.\" Bull shit. I reminded him that I was planning on replacing it soon so it didn't make sense to spend more money than needed. Knowing I wasn't going to get anywhere I said I'd call back and hung up. This wasn't the first (or last time) I would get this kind of treatment: \"Honey, why don't you just leave this to the men.\"\n\nA few hours later I called back, this time speaking in a lower tone, \"This is Px's boyfriend. I'm calling about her car.\" It was the same guy I'd spoken to earlier, but when a 'man' asked him about rebuilt parts it was no problem. They could definitely do that. I should've just taken the car somewhere else, but I needed transportation of my own. I proceeded to have my 'boyfriend' take care of all future contact with the mechanic.\n\nUltimately I got the car back for much less than they tried to get me to spend on a new part. I wish I could say I found a way to get justice, but I was too pissed about the whole thing to even attempt to come up with anything. I still live in the same place and have never gone back. I've also made sure to encourage anyone I know to avoid the place, especially women.\n\nOn the bright side I'm now a woman in IT and have mastered the art of taking guys like this down a peg or two (or ten) when they try this kind of shit with me.

        "text": "A little over a week ago, I went to go get my hair cut. I was going away in a couple days to an outdoor music festival, so I wanted my hair short and layered. On Tuesday evening, I was already out, so I went to the closest salon. I waited about fifteen to twenty minutes before it was my turn. So far, so good. \n\nThen I found out they don't wash hair at this place. Not a huge deal, they still spray your hair to get it wet. It's just my favorite part of getting my hair done. Anyway, I showed the stylist a picture of the cut I wanted (a cute chin-length bob with side bangs) and she got to work. I should've known what I was in for when she cut a section and asked \"like this?\" What else could I say at that point but yes? (For anyone who's never had long hair cut, they're supposed to pinch a section of hair with their fingers and ask that question.) But I was fine if my hair was a little shorter than I wanted, as long as it was still the style I want. \n\nAfter she cut off the length, she double-checked that I wanted \"lots of layers.\" I affirmed that I did and she got back to work. I watched as she chopped off my hair and it became something I didn't want. I tried to hide my disappointment (which I probably shouldn't have, but I've never had to tell a stylist I didn't like what they'd done before and I'm far too anxious to antagonize the person in control of my hair). She then revealed that it costs more to have it styled. I was desperate for my hair to be fixed, so I said that was fine. She finished up and I got out of there.\n\nI went to the store afterward and, as I was leaving, I realized what cut I had. It was the dreaded \"Can I speak to the manager?\" haircut. I was so devastated, I almost cried. It wasn't that she did a bad job-- it's that it wasn't even close to the cut I asked for. I found out later that this particular salon is geared more toward cutting men's hair, which explained a few things. Alas, I didn't have time to see if someone could fix it, as I was going out of town. I lived with that hair until yesterday.\n\nLast night after work, I went to the salon I usually go to to try and have it fixed. I explained that I'd gotten a bad cut and wanted more layers and better blending.  I wanted it smooth and not poofy. This stylist knew exactly how to fix it. I swear, the whole thing from shampoo (yay!) to blow drying, took only like fifteen to twenty minutes. Not only that, but the total cost was less than what I paid at the other place (including the hefty tip I gave the second lady for saving my head!). My hair still isn't the style I wanted, but it's loads better than it was. \n\nAnd now I don't feel compelled to tell every employee I see that I don't, in fact,  want to speak to the manager. ",

        "text": "Can't say I've ever actually had a truly unsavory customer service experience before...until now.\n\nLong story short, bought 2 pairs of shorts (~$60 ea) in December. One had the waistband stitching unravel not even 6 months later so I figured I'd see if customer service would do anything. They told me to ship them back and that it was \"definitely defective\".\n\nSent them back 6/9 and it was delivered 6/11. Hadn't heard anything so I contacted customer support again today. They told me ohhhh well there hasn't been any contact because they're out of warranty. (Well why did you have me send them back?) Ok fair enough - maybe the other rep didn't know better. So I asked when they would ship them back and he said since they were defective they have been discarded. He then stopped responding completely.\n\nlol...what? So let me get this straight.. You tell me to ship my defective product back so I do. Then you tell me it's not covered and further to that point, you went ahead and threw it away. Oh, and I also won't be receiving a refund.\n\n**So at this point I'm out $60 and the actual product.**\n\nTo anyone with more experience than me - what is my best course of action? CC dispute (Chase Sapphire Reserve), BBB (don't even see them on there), ship them boxes of rocks since their returns website prints labels for you?\n\nOpen to anything no matter how petty.\n\nEdit: Thanks so much for all the responses! Love Reddit. Truly appreciated. Come Monday I’ll start making moves.\n\nAlso, yeah they’re expensive shorts lol. I was buying some as a gift and thought what the heck I’ll get myself some. It was shorts with the athletic compression liner - but not the big major brand you might know (I imagine this would not be the situation if it was).\n\nEdit2: sent an email as well as tweet and Instagram comment. I’ll call tomorrow. If no response or resolution I’ll try Chase to do chargeback.\n\nEdit3: Couldn't get through on the phone and tried chat again. Received a different CSR (different name at least...the company has less than 10 employees so who knows if the chat names are actually real). He initiated the refund. **FINALLY!** Utterly ridiculous handling of a simple situation.... if only I could post the company name. They auditioned for Shark Tank and got shut down for being extremely arrogant. After this experience it's clear that mindset it the overall company culture.",

Because i stayed in the city over the summer i was the first to move in as a result my name was on all the bills.\n\n\nOne afternoon i was home before my housemates and was doing some coursework. At the time i was studying computer science and electronic engineering. I got stuck trying to figure out a programming related term and had gone to the ever knowing search engines to help me make up my mind. \n\n\n\nNo internet connection found......wut.  ok. I saved my work and restarted my laptop. Same problem of lets look.at the settings. It's all ok its not set up to the free WiFi setting. Ok let's restart the router. Nope that didnt work.and according to the damn thing it had internet. Tickle me intrigued.  Go i log into the router and change my browsers setting to use the free WiFi to make sure the router settings were correct. They were but as much as it was sending it wasn't reviving. So i called my provider. Had to go through all the hoops including turn it off and on again........ did it all again just to humour him. Still nothing. He obviously doesn't know what's going on and can't fix it. He then ask if i regularly turn off the router. It's a house of poor students yeah we turn off the router when no one is in and who ever comes home first turns it on last one out turns it off. This guys now comes out with this oh so lovely gem:\n\n\" Because you have been turning on and off your router it has learnt when to be off so if its on at a time its not usually on it won't work.\"\n\n\n\nWhat the actual fuck. After i scraped my jaw off my laptop keyboard i ask him to repeat what he just said. He repeats......... now i dont believe in shouting at customer service reps over the phone. I've been On the recieving end way too many times. But at that point my brain to mouth filter short circuited. I then explained to him how artificial intelligence worked from what i had been taught in uni and asked him if he expected me to believe that the router had AI. Gotta hand it to him he stuck to his lie. At that point I hung up on him. I knew if i stayed on the phone longer i was going to start shouting. I called back and got a lovely lady who had all her marbles. She informed me that the guy had put a note on my aaccount saying I was very rude. At that point I asked her for his name and asked her to put me through to complaints. I sung her praises and pretty much explained they had someone who was just saying any ole bs to get people off the phone.\n\n\n\nI have other stories like this from talking to customer service phone reps.

        "text": "Apologies in advance for this very long and somewhat tedious post.\n \nSo where to begin. My wife and I recently decided to visit Charlestown, SC. and booked a room at a major hotel chain in Downtown Charleston. As a business traveler I have found their properties to be consistently clean, comfortable and customer oriented. We booked a 2 night stay and then planned to visit family in Raleigh, NC.\n \nWe had a hassle free check-in but from there things went rapidly downhill. After getting settled in our room we decided to head down to the pool to relax after a full day of driving. When we got to the pool, the pool was drained with a sign saying that it would be closed for the next 2 days. We chuckled as we have a pool at our home in Florida that we never use, so it was funny in an ironic sort of way. We headed back to our room and planned to take a quick nap before seeing the sights of Charleston, only to be woken by the sound of a jack hammers coming through the wall or windows, it was at this point that we noticed a laminated notice advising guests that “the area surrounding the hotel is undergoing a massive transformation that will include parking, retail and office space.” and that “white noise” machines are available upon request. So no pool and we booked a hotel in the middle of a massive infrastructure project. Lol.\n \nAnyway no big deal, we decide we’ll check out the next morning and book another hotel. I decide to go down and let the front desk know we will only be staying the one night. When I get downstairs I find the front desk staff are checking in other guests and after a short wait speak to “T” at the front desk and tell her we have a 2 night reservation but we will be checking out a day early. She tells me no problem but that we are only booked in for 1 night. Again no big deal but I’m now confused and wondering if perhaps I booked the 2nd night at another hotel. \n\nNow before you start thinking that I’m a complete space cadet, I would point out that after 2 rounds of chemotherapy, my short term memory isn’t what it once was. So I go back to my room and start checking my email to see if I booked another hotel. I find my email confirmation and see that I made the reservation in my wife’s name. So I call “T” and say “Sorry, my bad, the reservation is in my wife’s name and just want to confirm we will be checking out tomorrow.”, pause, then long sigh from “T” , “Mr. J I already told you you’re only booked in for 1 night.” Me, “I just want to make sure we’re not charged for a 2nd night cause I have a confirmation email saying we’re booked for 2 nights.”\n \nFive minutes later “T”calls from the front desk, “Mr. J, just confirming you are only staying tonight, yes?” Me, “yes that’s correct, so you were able the find the reservation?” “T”, rather curtly answers “yes”.\n \nNow I understand that the service business is tough and guests can be a pain and demanding so I try not to make a tough job any harder. But I think that common courtesy demands at least an acknowledgement or token apology if you’ve made a mistake.\n \nBut since I’m trying to manage my stress levels, I take a deep breath and decide to move on.\n \nEverything is fine and my wife and I decide that rather than go out to dinner we’ll order in. I tell her, “I’m sure they have a list of restaurants that deliver, I’ll just call down and see if it’s in the room. “T” at the front desk picks up “No, Mr. J there is no list in the room, you need to come to the front desk. \n\nWhen I get down “T”and other front desk associate, are checking in guests. While I’m waiting, the guest with “T”seems to have trouble finding some documents, so I catch “T’s” eye and quickly say “can I just grab that list” to which she reply’s “I’m with customers, you’ll have to wait. \n\nSo 5 minutes later, the guests are checked in and as I walk to the desk “T” turns her back to me and walks to the office without a word, a little rude but I figure she’s going to get the list. Only, before that happens one of the Maintenance staff walks in and they proceed to have a conversation while I’m standing there. \n\nOnce they’re done, she walks into the office and returns a few minutes later with 2 flyers from local restaurants which she hands me with a rather dismissive “here”. At this point I’m frustrated and say to her, “you said you had a list.” to which she replied “we’re very busy with customers”.\n \nSo now I’m pissed off and I ask her to spell her name “cause I want to make sure I get it right” I think that should give her pause and maybe she’ll realize she needs work on her hospitality skills. \n\nAfter making a point of writing her name down I head back to my room only to find my keycard is no longer working. I call down and get “T” once again. I tell her my keycard is not working or has been deactivated and would she send someone up to let me into my room, to which she replied “we’re very busy, you need to come back and we will reissue you a new card” and hangs up.\n \nMy wife lets me in and I relate my adventures with “T” and how strange that all of a sudden my keycard is no longer working. I decide it’s time to escalate the matter so I call down and once again “T” answers and I ask to speak to the Night Manager to which she replies there is no Night Manager and that she is the front desk supervisor. I then ask for the name of the General Manager, to which she replies with the first name only, no last name. When I asked for the last name she tells me she can’t pronounce it but will spell it, but I’ll have to wait while she gets the spelling. \n\nShe then puts me on hold and after 3 minutes of waiting I figure I’m being ignored and hang up and call down again and she quickly puts me on hold again. After another 3 minutes on hold I hang up again and call back a 3rd time. “T” picks up again and before she can put me on hold for a 3rd time I quickly say, “just give me the spelling and I’ll stop calling”. At which point she spells the name and hangs up.\n \nAfter all this my wife and I decide we may as well go out, as neither of the restaurants “T” gave us flyers for looked appealing. So knowing I will need a new keycard to get back into our room I head down to the front desk. As luck would have it T” was not there and “C” the other front desk employee made us new keys. \n\nNow 2 things happened that were kind of funny. The 1st was that the keycard I handed “C” was from the hotel we stayed at the night before, which explains why it didn’t work earlier, my bad. So “T” definitely didn’t deactivate my keycard. \n\nNot that she made any effort to remedy to matter either. The other thing was that when “C” handed me the new keycards she also included the GM’s business card, that I had to wait for “T” to spell because she said she couldn’t pronounce it and apologized for the all the inconvenience.\n \nRealizing that she witnessed my earlier interaction, I asked her if she thought I had provoked “T” or was rude to her in anyway. To which she replied “no Mr. J, you were very polite, I am very sorry for what happened.\n \nLong story short, I wrote to the GM and told her my story and said I didn’t want “T” fired as we all have bad days. After all, she didn’t deactivate my keycard and as a Stage 4 cancer patient, I am an expert on having bad days. \n\nBut as President Obama once said “this is a teachable moment.” So while I know that Customer service is hard work and often thankless, a little bit of kindness can go a long way to build repeat customers and happy customers. “C” gets it, “T” on the other hand needs some more practice.\n \nOne final point I would make is that we booked our room directly with the hotel and not through a 3rd party website. So it would seems to me it would have been nice if someone had mentioned that the hotel was in the middle of a massive construction site. \n\nI’ll update this post ifI get a reply from the hotel.\n ",

My friend and I had just done a ton of rides, so we decided to hit up to carnival. We played a few games. Neither of us had a lot of money, and what we did have, we were saving for the convention. We got to the balloon popping game, which is one of my favourites.\n\nI paid for seven darts, making sure that my friend takes at least one, and we went for it. We both suck at the game, unsurprisingly, and the guy working there walks up. He said to us, “Let’s pretend you hit all of them.

On Saturday we stopped to have lunch and I suggested we head into a small town nearby where I knew that there was a nice cafe / bar. \n\nThe France-Australia game was on at the time so the bar was packed, but also because of the game there were plenty of seats out in the sun. \n\nWe ordered our three lemonades, five beers &amp; various dishes with a lovely waitress who was quite young.\n\nThe food eventually started to trickle out. Four croque monsieurs first, then after another short while three risottos and then finally one guys tarting italiene. With the football on we weren’t bothered with the wait and figured that it was just cause it was a big order and they were busy. Another round of beers and so we were ready to head off. \n\nThe game had finished and so had we so “l'addition s'il vous plait.”\n\nOut came the bill, a bit of bistro-math later and we had a pile of cash to pay.  We counted it out and decided that there was a bit too much so we took €10 out to use in the store next door and handed the cash over. \n\nWhile we were packing up, using the bathroom, etc. an older waitress came running over and (in French) explained that we had given them too much (€140 for a €118 bill). She held my hand out and counted the notes back into it handing me back a €20 note. I nodded and said “Yes, this as well,” and handed it back.\n\nLots of “merci beaucoups” and she went back to the counter declaring to the whole bar that the young waitress had received her first tip and it was a great one too! Then everyone cheered (no really).\n\nWe got a stumbling “thank you very much” from the young waitress. \n",

        "text": "I've been meaning to post this for a bit, but I'm just getting around to it. I'll try to keep it short. This happened the Saturday before memorial day. On mobile so sorry for mistakes.\n\nMy boyfriend and I were meeting up with his family for dinner at a local restaurant. It was me and him, his mom and dad, sister one, sister two, and two's husband and two young boys. SO and I were a couple minutes late, so when we got there everyone was already seated, but there was nothing on the table. No menus, water glasses, nothing. Ok, maybe our waitress was waiting for everyone to get there? Unfortunately not. We wait for a few minutes and eventually flag someone down for menus, still no sever though.\n\nFinally fifteen minutes later, our waitress drops by and tells us she's busy, and will by back in another fifteen minutes... and then she hovers for a minute and talks. Why she didn't quickly take our drink orders then, I have no idea. By this time about three other tables that arrived after us have been seated, given their drinks, and brought their bread (every table gets a basket of bread). One table even has their salads!\n\nBy now we're all getting antsy, and the kids are whiney and bored. Finally after being there for 30 minutes, our waitress comes to take our drink order. We tell her we're ready to order our meals too, which seamed to bother her, but too bad. Half way through our table ordering, another table waived to our waitress he was ready to give her his check. She straight up WALKS AWAY from our table, mid order, takes his check and goes to run his card. Like, what the fuck.\n\nNow quick side note, my SO's mom can be kind of difficult, and when somethings not right she'll let you know. Anyway, she's seeing red at this point. Our waitress comes back a few minutes later and finishes taking our orders, then disappears. By now we've been there for 40 freaking minutes, and still don't even have water! All of the tables that arrived after us have their meals, ones even almost finished.\n\nTen minutes later she shows up with our drinks and basket of bread. I've been a server before, and I know it doesn't take ten minutes to fill up drinks, and she sure as hell wasn't with another table. She throws (yes threw) our bread down and walks off. SO's mom is calling after her because we sill don't have utensils or little plates for our bread. Waitress glances her way, but ignores her and keeps walking. At that point mom flags down the hostess who brings us utensils. \n\nAfter another ten to fifteen minutes (which felt like eternity) waitress brings us our salads. These are basic salads, they don't take long to dish up and again, waitress was not on the floor so what took so long? Almost immediately our entrees were ready, so no one even came close to finishing the salad. Whatever, at this point we all just want this hell over with.\n\nUnfortunately.. our waitress had another idea. She messed up mom's order, of all people. Waitress brought her Chicken Alfredo when mom ordered the Pot Roast. God fucking damnit. Mom at this point might as well have steam coming out of her ears she's so pissed. We've been at the restaurant for well over an hour, and now have to wait for mom's order to be corrected. After dropping off our meals I asked waitress for a refill on my water. She nods THEN WALKS TO THE BACK! The water carafe was like three feet behind her!!\n\nAnyway, moving on. Ten minutes later a manager brings mom's corrected food to the table and luckily asks if we need anything else. I finally got my refill. We finish up eating (other than SO and BIL, who's food was way over cooked) and wait another eternity to pay. SO and I are both rather passive people, so after paying we left, but we got to hear all about mom ripping the manager a new ass hole. The manager gave mom a fifty dollar gift card, which mom agreed to use and then never return. SO and I agree.",

        "text": "This story always sticks out in my mind because it's the single time I left a bad tip in my entire history of being a customer. Typically I'm one of those where if you provide baseline decent service, I'll tip at least 20&amp;#37;. I know waitstaff make terrible wages and take hell from customers all day, so even a bad mood generally isn't enough to get me to drop it. I get it, everybody's human, and I try to remember my salary doesn't get cut if I tell someone to piss off at work.\n\nNot trying to humble brag here, just saying, it takes **a lot** to get me to stiff a waiter. This one took the freaking cake.\n\nSo we go to this casual all-you-can-eat place for dinner one night, basically a buffet except they cook the food after you assemble it. This is contributory because I felt the bad service was *extra bad* given that by waitstaff standards, this gig is pretty easy since all you really need to do is bring drinks and the occasional side dish and appetizer (and to their credit, we still go here, and have never had even a remotely bad time before or since this).\n\nSo we get seated, and wait for the waitress.\n\nAnd wait.\n\nAnd wait.\n\n6 minutes later she shows up (by now we've all hit our phones, because we're all getting the buffet food so it's basically just choosing a soda).\n\nShe does the opening spiel, cool. Asks what we want to drink. Takes the orders, doesn't tell us we can go get our food but we've been here before so we figure ok, she just knows we know the drill. Fine.\n\nWe go get our first plates and sit, and start eating despite not having drinks. Mind you:\n\n* I have been here dozens of times and this is the only time we've managed to get our entire first round without the drinks being ready when we got back to the table. I mean come on, it's 4 sodas.\n* She never even asked if we wanted $side-dish that we kind of did, but at this point we figure we have a newbie. That's fine, less carbs anyway.\n\nMid-way through the first round (and by the way I make my food spicy, so not having drinks around is kinda annoying) she shows up with 4 *waters.* Uhh, what happened to the soda order? Oh oops, she forgot. Off she goes. Whatever, least we have something now. She also still hasn't brought up a side dish.\n\nWe finish plate 1 and all go get round 2. Come back to find sodas, yay! Two of them are wrong, and this was before this place even had the flavor machine so it was just like, 8 different options that don't exactly sound alike. Ooookay...\n\nWe go through plate 2, and go get a plate 3, at least me and my then fat friend do. We finished our sodas and waters, she hasn't stopped by once to ask about refills. We finish our last plates, and my friend who like me has a pretty low bar for service is just fuming (literally, because he got a spicy dish for #3, and figuratively). He goes to talk to a manager.\n\nShe appears shortly after, clearly flustered, and asks if we still want $side\\_dish. What? We already ate. No, just the check please, split.\n\nShe comes back in record (for her) time, with the check all in one (I just paid because I wanted to get out of there), and an order of $side\\_dish that we didn't want. No actual apology by the way was ever given.\n\nWe left a penny in each of the cups of ice we had.",

The only lanes open were  the one  I was in and self serve. \n\n\nIn front of me in line is a 30-ish man with a cart full of stuff.  He didn't seem intoxicated or... I stand waiting for him to put his stuff on the belt, but he never does.\n\n I am starting to think that is was one of the carts full of stuff to be put back, as it seams to be be a hodge podge of stuff including a bra and a women's swimsuit  and some kids clothes along with male stuff like razors all heaped and tangled together. I mean to me it was a really random basket of stuff, including one lone can of corn.\n\n\nWhen the Lady in front finishes, he proceeds to hand the  items one item at a time to the cashier.  So while this is happening I take a bar, put it down, and start unloading at the back of the belt.  Then he gets the idea. But, instead of putting the stuff from his cart on the belt, he reaches over and puts a single box of Tic-Tacs from the display down ahead of the bar and then proceeds to continue to hand each and every item, one at a time, to the cashier.  Having to stop and untangle each  item of clothing from the others. $237.00 worth. Other than asking if they have plastic bags he doesn't say a word to the cashier. \n\n When he is asked if he wants the Tic-Tacs, he picks them up and puts them back in the display.\n\n\nSo finally it is all checked out. She had to ask him 3 times how he was going to pay. He seemed unclear on the concept. First he pulls out a wad of cash and goes through it, and then get his wallet and goes through that before deciding to use a card.",

However, I once had a legitimate bad experience that needed fixing. I got a burger that was supposed to be cooked medium, but was instead cooked to a crisp. I had cut it in half intending to take half home, and then taken one bite just to check if it tasted as overdone as it looked, whether it was edible or not. It was not. When I complained, the waitress shrieked at me loud enough for the surrounding tables to hear, \"Well, you already ate half of it!!\" Uhh, no, I cut it in half and took a bite, I did not (and would not, could not) eat half of it. Astoundingly, the manager backed up the waitress and I got no replacement. I think I still paid, but no tip. It was just one of several bad customer service experiences there, but it was the last straw for me. The restaurant went out of business less than a year later. It was sad, actually, now I have go to a chain food reheater with flair-wearing staff.",

        "text": "Here to post a good story! Last night my mother and I didn’t feel like cooking so we stopped by a Golden State themed pizza place that honestly doesn’t specialize in pizza, as it’s about 5 minutes from our house and we hadn’t been in a while. \n\nWe just had the most amazing service, it probably won’t sound that great but this waitress was just so nice. She was extremely friendly, joking around with us just the right amount, but not bothering us. \n\nAnd then we noticed our food was taking a while. About 45 minutes, which is unusual. \n\nShe comes over and says “Okay guys I am so sorry the table behind you got food before you, Ive been trying to figure out what’s going on. Looks like the kitchen forgot your order, but they’re rushing it right now and it’ll be out soon. I’ll make sure of it”\n\nNow, we can see the kitchen from our table, and I’ll be darned if she didn’t go stand in the kitchen staring at the cooks with her hand on her hip until she got our food (she only had two tables at this point so she had time to do this). I thought that was the funniest and nicest thing, like she truly cared if we got our food in a decent time. \n\nWe made sure to let her know we don’t blame her for the kitchens mistakes, as well. She suggested if we liked what we ordered a few things to try for next time, which was nice. All in all, she made the experience great. Of course she got a great tip and I also wrote a little note on the receipt about how great she was! ",

        "text": "[X post from r/MaliciousCompliance. I was told it would be more fitting here]\n\nOkay. This didn't happen to me. Happened to a friend who went shopping at a store where employees had to wear red polo shirts (no, it isn't the one related to a shooting objective. We don't have those in my country)\n\nMy friend told me he was at this store looking for some LED lightbulbs to replace the incandescent bulbs that would turn his room into a sauna and waste needless amounts of electricity for the lighting sources at home. He was wearing a red polo that day, which proved to be a poor idea. \n\nAs he was roaming the aisle, this middle aged woman (I'll call her Hag) \"greeted\" him with proper manners, along the lines of \"hey. Get me a power extension chord\". My friend turned to her and tried to explain he wasn't an employee, as he's a chill dude who doesn't like conflict. He said \"sorry miss. I don't know where they are. You should ask an employee.\" \n\nHag: \"Well you work here. You have the uniform. Get me the cable.\"\n\nFriend: \"miss. I don't...\"\n\nHag: \"you're being disrespectful and refusing to help a customer. I'll talk to your manager!\" \n\nMy friend got tired, and decided to play along before she got too over the top. And sarcastically said \"go ahead miss. Get me fired!\"\n\nOf course the lady didn't like this attitude, so she angrily barked \"I will!\" At him, before stomping off to get the store supervisor. \n\nMy friend continued searching for his lightbulbs, got them, and as he started to walk towards the checkout area, he felt a tap on his shoulder. He turned. \n\n\"Miss. Is this him?\" Said the supervisor to Hag. \"He is.\"\n\nThe supervisor looked at my friend up and down, sighed, turned to the lady and said \"I don't know him.\"\n\nHag: \"what do you mean you don't know him? He's wearing the uniform!\"\n\nSupervisor: \"no he's not. That's a red polo. It isn't even the same shade of red of the uniform. [turning to my friend] excuse me. Do you work here?\"\n\nFriend: \"as I told the lady before. I don't\"\n\nSupervisor: \"okay miss. There's nothing I can do. He's another customer.\"\n\nThe lady scoffed, turned around, and angrily left. \n\nMy friend went to the checkout line, paid for his bulbs, and left as well. \n\nTL;DR. Friend gets mistaken for an employee by old hag, plays along, supervisor can't punish him because he isn't an employee. Old hag is pissed. \n\n(And no. It isn't a Kanuck something store. We don't have those in my country. It's a home depot style store)",

        "text": "Longtime reader, first time poster, on mobile so sorry for any weird formating.\n\nSummary at the bottom\n\nThis story takes place at a local owned business in a small town. We never been and decided to try it for father's day. Everything is going smoothly until food comes out, everyone's is fine except my dad's. He had order a run sandwich but instead it's clearly roast.\n\n My dad looked pissed. It was obvious they just tried to substitute the meat without telling or asking, the reason I think this is because the manager immediately came over after all the food was sat down. \n\nM will be for manager and D will be for my dad\n\nM: Is everything looking alright\n\nD: This doesn't look like rib to me\n\nM: Well why don't you try it and see if you like it\n\nAt this point both my dad and his girlfriend try it and it's clear it's roast and not rib.\n\nD: This isn't rib, this isn't what I ordered\n\nM: Well would you like something else\n\nD: No its fine, it's just not what I ordered\n\nM: Here why don't I get you something else\n\nD: No its fine\n\nThe conversation carried on like this until dad gave him back the plate and didn't want to order anything else.\n\nM: Come on, I'm trying to help you man let me just get you something else\n\nD: I'm fine\n\nC: Come on, I'm just trying to help you \n\nD: Fine let me just get a burger\n\nAt this point it's been probably a 10 minute conversation. My dad hates being pushed so he is even more irritated because of that and the fact the manager didn't hide the fact it was roast but didn't admit it either. \nDad his burger and it's been about an hour since we've sat down. The manager says he'll come and see if dad likes it in a few minutes. He never comes to the table again.\n\nNow comes the icing ont this mess of a fathers day. We have only seen the waitress once, she didn't stop by for a food check and nearly everyone's glass is empty. I can tell that all staff is avoiding us like the plague. A different waitress than the one who sat us finally comes to get us refills. My dad is completely pissed. We just decided to get the check and leave. We finally see the waitress who took our order and she gives us our reciept. They took off the my dad's burger and the drinks which made my dad a calm down a bit. \n\nWe give the waitress the card to pay and get ready to leave. She comes back and tells us another waitress forgot to put on the drinks. So she fixed it without telling us and ran the card. Without telling us. I understand forgetting to add something to the reciept, but you inform the person before running the card. My dad was pissed at this point. My sister and I decided we should go out for a smoke. 5 minutes later my dad's girlfriend comes out and joins us. 15 minutes later my brother comes out and in another 5 so does my dad. From what I got my dad went up to the manager and told him what happened and how my dad felt like this was bullshit we saw our waitress twice, they tried to give my dad something that he didn't order and all staff was avoiding us like the plague.\n\nSummary: Replace meat on my dad's order without telling him. Only saw our waitress once and they messed up the bill.",

        "text": "Mobile, first post, tldr at bottom, yadda yadda.\n\nSo about two years ago I decided it was time to get a car. I was getting close to my twenties and had a small fund from my mom as she died when I was young. Anyway, not important. I decided to use the fund for a car since aside from school that would be my only major investment for a long time.\n\nSo after looking through the various lots (it's a car mall) for a few hours, I finally found a car I fell in love with. It was a certain energy efficient hybrid car, compact, and to top it all off it was the same color as my mom's car when she died (bright orange). \n\nNow, I was visiting from another state, but would be here for a month and my aunt who was in charge of my fund lived here. I was nervous about whether I could get a car or not because the licensing standards were somewhat strict in the state I lived in. So naturally, first thing I asked when we came inside was if it would be possible to get the car licensed for the state I lived in. The salesman was not sure (super sweet guy, not the typical salesman), so he brought out the financer who ASSURED me that it could happen, and that I would be well taken care of. Boy was I a fool to listen to him.\n\nAfter that it took a few hours to get the money from the bank, start my insurance, pay for licensing, etc. then I finally get the car and the financer gives me two trip permits and says \"come back when you run out!\"\n\nSo, naturally, I run out after a week because they each last three days, I come back and he gives me one more. I'm confused but just go with it (mind, I DID tell him I'd be there the whole month and needed to be able to drive the car around, and then home after they got my plates for me). \n\nAfter I run out of this one I don't need another for a few days, so when I finally needed one I decided to call the financer to see if he is in office. I call the place up and the secretary tells me he is in, transfers me, and no answer... so I leave a voicemail and find his extension online, then proceed to call him SIX more times over the next two days. No answer, I'm stranded at my friend's house (since now my permit has expired), and after digging around online I find out that by state laws I am only allowed three permits per MONTH (9 days worth). \n\nSo now not only can I not get around, I also cannot get home to pick up license plates (the dmv had called me around this time saying that they could not be mailed because the car needed inspection. Even though the financer told me it'd be taken care of! And I got no communication about it from the dealership)\n\nSo basically, I ended up having to stay here and change my address (I was considering it anyway) to get the car properly licensed; I still live here two years later.\n\nTl;dr I get that the dealership has limits on what it can do, but at least let your customer know that BEFORE they invest $15k on a car.",
