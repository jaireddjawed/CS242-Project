Sound design is also strong. \n\nIt's one of those shows/stories I could list 20 little things I really love about it. There's a lot of passion put into this if you look for it.",

I am trying to find the name of a movie and the name of an animated miniseries that aired one summer on the WB(now CW) that I only have vague memories of due to memory issues. Both had to do with alien invasions.\n\nThe movie involved climate change and a climatologist or biologist who was studying a change in tundra biome where flowers were starting to grow because the ground was no longer frozen and a male protagonist who worked for some kind of satellite/computer company. I think. Aliens were altering our planet as they slowly infiltrated our world. They either wore human skins or were human like in appearance.\n\nThe animated miniseries that aired one summer on the WB involved a more direct military style invasion. The main character was a human like alien or half human half alien who fought against the invasion. The miniseries was a week long event that went on for an hour or two each night. I think it was called Invasion America, but I am not sure.\n\nI have searched for both online to no avail. Please help me find them.",

It seems that they had occupied all of France, Germany, most of Eastern Europe (stopping at Belarus, Ukraine and Romania, I think) and most of the Balkans. What about Spain, Italy, Greece and Scandinavia? Are these countries holding off or on the verge of defeat? \n\n**Fighting forces:** It was mentioned that the Chinese and Russian armies are fighting in Eastern Europe, but are they doing any better than those in the Operation Downfall? Do they have access to battle jackets too? \n\n**Verdun:** What happened after the battle lead by Rita when she first got her power? Did people set up fortification there? Verdun lies between France and Germany, but Germany is under Mimics' control, so now we have a human enclave deep inside Mimics' territory?",

What is around prior to the big bang or the universe we understand being born in the first place? \n\nWe only know that the universe is estimated to be 13.7 billion years old, but if we went back even further rewinding another googolplex amount of years, what would we find this far back? This far back in time, let's assume the temperature would be the opposite of being the heat death of the universe, as within the very distant past, it's even 1-trillion times colder than the ice ages, both north / south poles, glaciers or the everest combined despite being in a unknown space which looks like the death of the universe but it's just before the start of our timeline.",

I could turn off all the ship functions except for the lights and power, basically going dark, so I’d be completely hidden. It would be the ultimate hideout where I could play games, read, and do whatever else I feel like. \n\nI’ve never understood that about Star Wars, where they say they’ll find a planet to hide out on, even though if someone was looking for a criminal the first place they would look is a planet.
