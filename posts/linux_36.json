        "text": "In the days of X11, we had separate software to do different things: Xorg was one software, the windows manager was another one, and even the window decorator was often a separate stuff. If you wanted, you could even have a separate compositing manager instead of having a windows manager that also did compositing (an example is picom). This compartmentalization was standardized and, although it apparently caused some complications, it had the undoubted advantage of being good for stability: in the event of a crash of the windows manager, for instance, one only had to restart it and no work was lost. To be on the safe side, one could have two windows managers installed and if a bug did not allow restarting the default one, the user could start the second one.\n\nWith Wayland, things have completely changed and the window manager / compositor is also the display server. This means that a crash of the wm/compositor/display server kills all open graphics software.\n\nThis is especially risky because on modern desktops windows managers are complex software, which handle graphic effects, and it takes very little to crash them. For instance on KDE, Kwin is pluggable with effects and scripts. On Gnome, even the Gnome Shell itself is a Mutter plugin. So, a bug in a Gnome shell extension can kill the entire session.\n\nSuch a design in which the stability of the entire graphical system depends on a single piece of software, and its plugins, does not make sense.",

        "title": "The Linux Process Journey — “md” (Multiple Device Driver)",
        "author": "boutnaru",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/zsv8em/the_linux_process_journey_md_multiple_device/",
        "text": "“md” is a kernel thread which is based on a workqueue ([https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.1/source/drivers/md/md.c#L9615](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.1/source/drivers/md/md.c#L9615)).  It is responsible for managing the Linux md (multiple device) driver  which is also known as the “Linux software RAID”. RAID devices are  virtual devices (created from two or more real block devices). This  allows multiple devices (typically disk drives or partitions thereof) to  be combined into a single device to hold (for example) a single  filesystem.([https://linux.die.net/man/8/mdadm](https://linux.die.net/man/8/mdadm)).\n\nBy  using the “md” driver we can create from one/more physical devices  (like disk drivers) a virtual device(s). By the use of an array of  devices we can achieve redundancy, which is also known as RAID  (Redundant Array of Independent Disks). For more information I suggest  reading [https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man4/md.4.html](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man4/md.4.html).\n\nOverall,  “md” supports different RAID types: RAID 1 (mirroring), RAID 4, RAID 5,  RAID 6 and RAID 10. For more information about RAID types I suggest  reading the following link [https://www.prepressure.com/library/technology/raid](https://www.prepressure.com/library/technology/raid). Besides that, “md” also supports pseudo RAID technologies like: RAID 0, LINAR, MULTIPATH and FAULTY ([https://doxfer.webmin.com/Webmin/Linux\\_RAID](https://doxfer.webmin.com/Webmin/Linux_RAID)).\n\nThe  block devices that can be used in order to access the software RAID on  Linux are in the pattern “/dev/mdN” (where N is a number \\[0–255\\]) ([https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/managing-raid-on/9780596802035/ch01s03.html](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/managing-raid-on/9780596802035/ch01s03.html)).  It can also be configured to allow access using “/dev/md/N” or  “/dev/md/name”. If we want information about the current state of “md”  we can query the file “/proc/mdstat” — for more information you can read  [https://raid.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Mdstat](https://raid.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Mdstat). There is also the command line utility “mdadm” that can help with managing those devices ([https://linux.die.net/man/8/mdadm](https://linux.die.net/man/8/mdadm)).\n\nLastly,  The code of “md” is included as a driver/kernel module in the source  code of Linux. Thus, it can be compiled directly into the kernel or as a  separate “\\*.ko” file. In my VM (Ubuntu 22.04) it is compiled directly  into the kernel image as shown in the screenshot below. The init  function is declared using “subsys\\_initcall” (and not the “module\\_init”)  which ensures that it will run before the device drivers that needs it  (if they are using “module\\_init”) — [https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.1/source/drivers/md/md.c#L9947](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.1/source/drivers/md/md.c#L9947). More information about initcalls will be included on a future writeup.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4uqfyzlv8i7a1.jpg?width=558&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8484bb6c30fceecfcf805ed2ea7c0e289cdf00e2",
