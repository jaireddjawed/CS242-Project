I live on a street of homes that all sit on an acre of land right off and hidden next to the highway, and in-between two commercial buildings one being a single commercial building and the other being 3 warehouses, This is a one way in one way out neighborhood and is by no means a high class neighborhood, more standard neighborhood, crappy roads and all. \n\nI am a first generation business owner, and have no idea on how to do this next step. \n\n**My questions are:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. I am looking to see what needs to be done to get permission to build a 30\" x 40\" warehouse in the back of the property, This warehouse will have 0 clients in it, as we only ship out products. \n2. What steps should I take first in this process, (I have found a warehouse that can be delivered for a reasonable price, and have secured the information and pricing on a slab to be build).\n3. I require 3-phase power for my machinery and am wondering what steps do I need to take to get a power pole/line dropped for the building.\n4. Do I need permits or inspections for the power line to be dropped?\n5. Anything I should know about this whole process, from people who have gone this route, or people who know someone who has done this?",

Planning is a career change for me; I am in my early 30's, with a degree in Geography, and previously worked for a year as an intern for city of 100k. Now, I am the assistant city planner working directly underneath a city manager who is elusive and pretty reliably wrong/unavailable. I know that could come across as me being picky, but the facts are that he watches youtube/ESPN a good portion of the workday, and his kids are in our shared office playing from 3-5 almost every afternoon. \n\nAnyway, at the moment nuisance abatement is really wearing me down, with potential of a couple long term offenders escalating to lawsuits. On top of that, I have a 40 minutes commute. I'm seriously debating what I want to do. I hate enforcement, I make approx 32k after taxes and am planning to move out of state in 2-3 years for my partner's job (academia). Which adventure should I choose???\n\nOption A: Continue on in position, consider graduate school later in the place we permanently settle down.\n\nOption B: Take the GRE, apply to graduate school, get an assistantship that will pay for school (50% chance of this), get a MUP in a state I do not want to live in.\n\nOption C: Plan to be able to work without an advanced degree.",

        "text": "Hello. friends!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am getting ready to apply for graduate school and was looking at the costs of US degrees versus international degrees and saw that there was a huge difference.  As of now, I have enough to pay for my masters out of pocket including living expenses and airfare with some left over for emergency.  My question is, how can I find out more information for these programs?  And if I get my masters degree somewhere else, will it still be valid in the United States? It has been hard for me to find any information in this regard.  I already have a bachelor's in environmental studies and a minor in land-use planning and hoping that a masters will open more doors for me.  Will I still be eligible and prepared to take the AICP exam? ",

This is my third job out of College but I have not been in the planning field until now. My first job was as a Environmental Technician (1 year) and now I work as a GIS Technician (6 months). \n\nMy degree is in Natural Resources Management and I discovered that I didn’t want to enter continue in that field during my first job so I started a GIS certificate program while working and eventually landed a GIS position. I still want to further my GIS skills but also want to develop in the Urban Planning field and possibly specialize in flood risk management/emergency planning. \n\nAnyway, I just wanted to give you all a general background of mine because I would like to get some advice for starting a career in this field. Any advice/information is appreciated and I would also like to know if you came from a similar background. \n\nAlso, I am leaving my current job because it has no benefits, PTO, retirement, etc. The job I accepted pays more and has benefits. Anyway, thank you for your responses in advance! \n\n",

I can tell you right now that I'm getting sick of it. I clearly don't have 2-3 years of urban planning experience other than my senior capstone project that involved zoning plans, GIS, and public perception surveys.\n\nI'm considering reaching out to people on my LinkedIn or companies around my area to see if there are any projects and tasks that I can try to help them with. I know many people frown upon working for free but I really have no choice right now other than volunteering. I really loved the urban planning classes that I took and the projects that I completed during college, which is why I'm willing to do whatever it takes to learn more about urban planning. If any of you can provide some guidance for me, that would be great! Thank you!",

I've had a couple of ideas but i really want to hear your thoughts as I'm sure it could be better (havent really done zoning and urban planning before).  \n\n\nMy idea is attached. All criticism is welcome.\n\nQuick info:  \n\\-it's in the north of an east european city\n\n\\-it supposed to be mainly residential, up to 4 floors high (obvs with other zonings as it's a huge project and it needs auxiliaries)  \n \\- 240.000 sqm  \n \n\nhttps://i.redd.it/6w6f65qv06o11.jpg\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/a5hnh3dy06o11.jpg",
