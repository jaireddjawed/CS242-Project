        "text": " Hi, I used to watch on 40-inch HD TV in my hometown. Then, I got to a new city and bought 43 inch UHD TV. During the first week, the images on the tv and the tv itself appeared large to my eyes. It even gave dopamine rush to me. After days passed, the TV shrank, and the wall surrounding it got more into my visibility. To ensure the proofness, I even measured the tv using tape, which was fine. Then after some months, when I returned to my home town, the 40-inch tv appeared like a mobile phone hanging on the wall to me. Could you explain why the perception is happening?",

        "text": "It's the only thing my biology book says about the brain. It explained that connector neurons send impulses from sense neurons (from receptors) to the brain, and gives impulses through the motor neurons to effectors (muscles and glands). \n\nIt tells that in the brain the cell bodies of connector neurons are grouped together in groups for sense and motor stuff, some stuff being grouped elsewhere, like hearing, speaking and seeing.\n\nBut then what? Where and how is recieved data \"processed\" and how is data for motor neurons \"created\"? From what I understand the connector neurons are only meant to transport impulses from sense nerves to motor nerves, but if there's nothing but connector neurons in the brain, I'd think we would live on auto-pilot with no ability to think freely, and that motoric activities are always a result of things receptors interpret. \n\nI'm not studying biology, I've only got my book from high school. Maybe there is more to it but is it too complicated or too much to be explained in there. Or maybe there's just not enough known about the brain yet.",

The trisomia in the first place arises from a non-disjunction - but how do some cells manage to loose the extra chromosome and become 'normal' again? Is it just pure chance that a secondary non-disjunction of the chromosome occurs, reverting part of the cells to a normal karyotype, that can then proliferate in the embryo and result in the mosaicism? Or does there rather exist an actual molecular mechanism, by which trisomias are 'rescued'?\n\nThanks in advance!",

        "text": "Hello dear biologists,\nI'm an highschool student and my biology teacher wants each of us to present a case of coevolution to the class at a vaguely defined point in the future. We've already talked about the generic example of the Hummingbird and the Orchid, which is pretty easily explained. I was hoping to find a more unique case, one that I could get my classmates interested in. \nUnfortunately I'm struggling with finding some, so it would be awesome if you had some ideas!",

I'm currently writing a book about axolotls and I saw a lot of usian breeders saying that housing males and females together shouldn't be done because the male can \"breed her to death\".\n\nSince this is totally different from what breeders and keepers claims here in Italy (and in other countries too), I was looking for any evidence in any kind of scientific paper that this actually happens.\n\nI tried to search myself, but I wasn't able to find anything and the papers that I read also mention the fact that axolotl males tends to be more sexually active on spring and that housing them with other axolotls of any sex, actually seems to reduce their interests in mating. \n\nIf some of you have any paper that might be useful, I would ask to link here down below in the comments. \n\nThanks in advance",
