She spent 2 thousand dollars to buy the miles. Like, the whole point in using miles is to get a free ticket with the miles you have accumulated, OR if the ticket is WAAAAAY more expensive in dollars. Not the other way around. To make matters worse she claims \"nobody told her\" how much it was going to cost, but she did it online.\n\n\n&gt; \"I need you to reverse this\"\n\n&gt; Sorry but all purchases are final. They are your miles, you have them to use.

        "text": "Around 7 years ago I graduated with interiordesign diploma, at the time there was not much work offerings in the field so I landed a temporary Callcenter job.  The compagny offered cleaningladies/men for domestic household at government sponsored prices. My job was taking calls from workers and clients.  Mostly the other way around but in best cases the day started as follows: worker calls before expected to work: I cant work for this and this reason, If a valid reason (strickt rules); I call the client with the message and if possible a replacement request upon availability. Most of the time the client calls and asks:  'Where is my householdworker??' another no-show... This happens alot in this layer of society but I have to stress that 70% of our workers were fine and always on time. There was always a persistent 20% percent who almost never showed up and always made trouble for the most stupid reasons and then a 10% of fairly good and well seasond liers and magnificent storytellers, unfortunately not on the 'bright' side, so I smelled them from a mile away.  I am not a work nazi but everybody needs to be on time on their job, people are depending on them and if they dont show up (with or without notice) they make my life as a callcenter employee's life hell, because I have to deal with their dissapointed (a big understatement) client, and I fairly know there is almost no replacement so the care needing client will have to wait 14 days to get their house cleaned... can they get fired then: no, there is an elaborate system of warnings and medeation conversations before firing, just because the compagnie is in need of hands to perform the job... waitinglists to get a householdworker is huge yada yada...\n\nNow 3 months in and I start to get fairly well seasond...\n\nIt is the first day of snow and yes I know what's coming... First call of the day was a male householdcleaner (MH)wich can be catagorized in the last 10%. storytime :) : \n\nME: '\"compagniename\", hello with 'grietennaaier' how may I help?'\nMH: 'Hello goodmorning this is MH here, I cant go to my first client and will have to stay home because of the weather'\n\nYou have to know i my country it fairly never snows anymore the last 15 years (THANK YOU climate change...) so 2 cm snow and freezing tempertures are rare but nevertheles when it happens it leads to massive psychosis in traffic and scared people (kid you not...)\n\nME: 'Thank you for calling! Tell me what happend MH?'\nMH:' I always go by motorbike to my client and this morning I come out to my driveway and I see that MY WHEELS ARE FROZEN TO THE GROUND! I can't leave! It is impossible! Ok?'\nME: 'OWKEY (rolling my eyes nice try dude!), did you just mention your bike is on your driveway?'\nMH: 'Yes?'\nME: 'Sorry man, bad news for you: compagnierules state that you will have to find an alternative way of transport towards your client when your vehicle didnt leave your driveway yet... I know it is cold, youknow, I had to go this morning also thru wintertraffic so you are expected in 20' at your clients, thank you for calling MH.'\nMH: 'But but GRMBL, I will take the bus then...'\n\nHe arrived only 5 minutes late at his first client, (I called him to check up on him) with or without motorbike, I dont know, but no cozy morning at home for you man, I'm sorry!\n\nIt is allready 6 years ago and I worked there for a year.  Man the stories and things going south... I learned there and then that I can never project my own values on life towards other people and expect them as such 'doing the right thing'... Some people are just a different breed... \n\n EDIT: typo's\nEDIT2: climate change vs global warming THX!",

I know the problem, you guys won't fix the transmitter leading to my property.

If you'd like we can schedule a technician for you right away.\n\nPC: No, there's nothing you people can do. You don't want my business. Your technicians have never been able to resolve this even during the last 20 visits (records show only 4 visits made during the year, and 1 other visit made in the past year. 3 of the visits were made during the last 30 days). I'm not going to even bother because you guys don't really want to address my issue.\n\nThat's why we need the technician to visit. They will be able to track down what went wrong and also determine if the pole is repaired correctly.\n\nPC: No, I'm not going to request for a tech.\n\nSo what do you suggest we do?\n\nPC: Nothing. You guys can only do nothing. One thing though, I'm going to keep calling back because you guys keep killing my service and you don't want to fix it (tech pls? What am I scheduling a tech for if not to fix)\n\nWell, if that's what you think, I won't schedule the technician then. Also, I won't be able to properly assist you with this given that this is a wiring issue? At best I can alleviate your intermittent connectivity issues, but not entirely fix it if this is a wire issue. Were there anything else I could assist you? (At this point I don't bother with a modicum of positive phrasing)\n\nPC: No. Actually, I'd like to get a supervisor.\n\nSure thing, give me one moment and let me put you on a quick hold.\n\nPC: *held, then automatically disconnects while trying to set up transfer*\n\nMe: Shrug, that's one transfer metric saved? :/",

Good thing I have a fidget cube to mess with during these calls. \n\nFirst we had the whackadoodle. Lady calls in wanting to make an appointment with Neurosurgery for her husband. Please note, the hospital this lady was referencing is known to attract a rather *special* kind of patient. \n\nShe goes on to say that two years ago her husband, who is a contractor, had a client who tried to murder her husband by hitting him over the head and he subsequently was seen at the neurosurgery clinic. Hang on because it gets better. \n\nThis guy's chart shows that he hasn't been seen since 2010 and supposedly this injury occurred in 2015. The doctor whose name she gave me appears to work at that hospital but isn't listed as far as which clinic he works in and he doesn't work in neurosurgery. \n\nApparently her husband was having some issues that supposedly stem from this injury so that's why she wants him to see his doctor that saw him in neurosurgery. \n\nSo I'm trying to figure out what this lady is even talking about so I call my supervisor to see what we can even do without being able to confirm if he was seen at neurosurgery before. We look everywhere. We check for any discharge notes, look all over his chart and come up empty handed. I think my supervisor was thinking this lady is touched in the head too. She tells me to refer the guy to his primary care provider and if need be, they'd refer him to neurosurgery. \n\nI get back on the line with whackadoodle and tell her this and the story just keeps getting better. She tells me their *whole* story. Apparently they have no money to see a primary care provider because this guy who tried to kill her husband is still stalking them and they've moved several times. According to her, he has also somehow hacked their bank records and photoshopped it to look like they made three times more money than they actually did and the IRS is after them. At this point she even starts crying. \n\nApparently this guy is just out to ruin their lives and somehow is also the reason they can't get insurance. I'm just sitting there being half entertained by the weird stuff coming out of this lady's mouth and half wanting her to just get off my phone. This was at least half an hour phone call. \n\nThen there's lonely lady. Lonely lady doesn't even tell me what she wants until 3/4 of the way through the call. Turns out she just wants to send me a message to her doctor. \n\nBefore that though she went over her entire medical history, most of which was irrelevant to anything. Tells me about this surgery she wants and nobody will do it. Tells me about her experiences with incontinence and her apartment. Tells me about why she doesn't want to get a cat. Tells me she wants to get a beta fish instead and tells me *all* about her last beta fish. And all of this before we even get to the \"why are you calling?\" part. \n\nI really need to stop being so nice. Maybe I need to develop a resting bitch voice. ",

She was royally pissed as she had just opened her 17\" monitor box and discovered that her CRT monitor was only 13.5 inches wide.\n\nAt this point, I had to mute myself because I had started chuckling and I didn't want to further escalate this obviously unhappy customer by laughing at her. Once, I regained my composure and she had finally taken a breath, I started asking her some questions. \"Ma'am, who you happen to be using a yardstick to measure this monitor?\" I asked. With a puzzed voice she replied \"Umm, Yes.\"  I then asked her if she was measuring the screen across the bottom edge of the screen to which she again replied sheepishly, \"Yes.\" At this point I explained to her that all CRT screens, both in TVs and in computer monitors were measured diagonally, corner to corner and I asked her to measure hers that way. I Asked: \"Does it measure 16.5 inches diagonally, corner to corner?\"  She again quietly replied \"Yes.\" I then added that if she allowed 1/4 inch all around for the plastic bezel to hold the tube in the chassis, it was 17\".  \n\nShe agreed and seemed satisfied with my answer when she asked me one final question. \"Does this mean I need to call H. H. Gregg back and tell them my 33\" TV is as 33\" TV. Again, I reached out for the mute button before I broke up laughing. I finally managed an straight faced \"yes\" and asked if there were any problems with the computer itself, she replied she didn't know as it was still in it's box. She'd only opened the Monitor box and immediately called tech support when she made the assumption she was getting ripped off like she had with H. H. Gregg.  I told her she was welcome to call back if she had any other issues and thanked her for calling the tech support line.\n\nThis call made my week.",

This one left me shaking my head. \n\nMe: *standard company opening* \n\nIT Idiot: Yeah hi, I've got a problem. I've got a fleet of phones here that I'm responsible for, and one of them is messed up bad.\n\nMe: I'm very sorry to hear that, we can definitely look into solving your issue today.\n\n*Standard verification process* \n\nMe: Alright, so what seems to be the problem with that device?\n\nIT Idiot: Yeah, so I updated the software on this phone right? Well now it's stuck in a boot loop!\n\nMe: I'm very sorry to hear that sir, did you have a chance to do a factory reset using the device's boot menu?\n\nIT Idiot: Of course I tried that already, I work in IT, I know how these things work! And anyways that's exactly what  $Manufacturer said to do anyway!\n\nMe: My apologies sir, so the factory reset didn't work for you, it's still boot looping? \n\nIT Idiot: Exactly! I couldn't complete it anyways! Yeah, I put an IT policy on the phones to prevent factory resets. I need you to deem this phone defective and replace it!\n\nMe: I'm terribly sorry sir but I won't be able to do that as it isn't an issue with the device, but an issue with your IT policies you've placed on the device. Your phone isn't defective.\n\nIT Idiot: But that's not fair! I updated it from the server, but your device simply won't connect to anything to receive the updated policy information!\n\nMe: I can certainly understand your frustration with the situation here today, but there is nothing I can do for you from  $Company's perspective. I'm sorry.\n\nIT Idiot: *incoherent mutterings lined with curse words*\n\n*call disconnects*\n\nIt's worth noting as well that even if his device had been defective, he was one day outside of his warranty.

        "text": "Greetings TFCC,\n\n\nI came across your sub a few days ago, and was pleased to see that my experiences of dealing with *joe public* are much the same as many of yours. Hence here i am, with another absolute Gem.\n\n\nIf you've seen my [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromcallcenters/comments/6c5wf0/my_son_sent_me_some_green_stuff/), you'll know i work for a logistics company, specifically the international contingent of the business. Technically, we're an admin office - but we also both take and make calls throughout our normal working day.\n\n\nThis tale refers to a call i took, only a month or so after starting  the job. For some further context, a reasonable proportion of the import calls we take are Chinese students; their parents having sent them packages from home. The majority of these individuals seem to have very poor English, which can make conversation difficult... or hilarious...\n\n\nM = Me\n\nCR = Chinese recipient\n\n\n*Normally when i tell the story i imitate the accent too, but i'll leave you to your own devices in this case!*\n\n\n&gt; M: Good afternoon, ---- Dept, IntLogistic speaking, how can i help?\n\n&gt; CR: [louder than necessary] HELLO, I AM CALLING ABOUT MY CABBAGE SENT FROM MY FAMILY.\n\n\n*Here we go again...*\n\n\n&gt; M: Sorry sir, your cabbage?\n\n\n&gt; CR: Yes my parents sent me cabbage, you want track number?\n\n\n*Why does this always happen to me? At this point, its pretty obvious he means PACKAGE and not CABBAGE, but i don't see the point in making the distinction*\n\n\n&gt; M: Okay, go ahead!\n\n\n*CR Reels off the tracking number, i thank the customer and put the number into my tracking system and looked over the information, asking the customer to wait a moment whilst i check the details*\n\n\n&gt; M: Alright, thank you for holding. One of our drivers attempted to deliver your package to your home address yesterday afternoon. The tracking states nobody was present at the address to sign for the shipment, is that the case?\n\n\n&gt; CR: YES, where my cabbage?\n\n\n&gt; M: Its currently held at a PostOffice for collection. Would you like the address?\n\n\n&gt; CR: I have to get my cabbage?\n\n\n*At this point i've put my Mic up (slightly above my eye level) because i'm trying not to let the customer hear me  chuckling, i'm debating having... the conversation... after a long sigh, i pull my mic back down and go for it*\n\n\n&gt; M: Sir, by *CABBAGE* do you actually mean *PACKAGE* ?\n\n\n&gt; CR: [loudly and enthusiastically] NO IS CABBAGE, WHERE IS MY CABBAGE?\n\n\n*Well that was a waste of time...* \n\n\n&gt; M: You can collect your CABBAGE [manager starts laughing] from the PostOffice, the address is ---- ---- Road, ZipCode: -----. You'll need to take some form of Ident...\n\n\n&gt; CR: AH YES THANKYOU I GET MY CABBAGE BYEEE!\n\n\n*CR ends the call, everyone at my table is laughing. It was one of those calls where, though my colleagues could only hear my half of the conversation, they knew exactly what was going on.*\n\n&gt; Manager: [across the desk] How did that go?\n\n\n&gt; M: Well, if the PostOffice works it out that he actually wants a parcel, and not a damn vegetable - he'll be fine. Otherwise they're probably going to send him to the grocery store and he'll call back in an hour or so.\n\n\nThe customer didn't call back. And i spent the rest of my afternoon contemplating why anyone with a poor grasp of English would need to know what a cabbage is anyway. So far as i know, cabbage isn't a delicacy anywhere in the world...\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Sir? Are you still there?\n\n\n&gt; WD: HE SENT ME GREEN F----ING TEA. THAT LITTLE ----. I'M SO SORRY.\n\n\n&gt; M: [trying not to laugh] No problem sir, enjoy your brew!\n\n*WD ends the call, clearly embarrassed, i'm almost speechless, and turn to my manager - only to find he's crying into his keyboard*",

I'm basically a part of the Email/call center that takes the orders but for replacement parts on those commercial units. The main department which does sales (the ones that sell the big stuff) is a separate department on its own.  Our company bought out our competitor in 2014. \n\n\nSo basically this customer called in, extremely angry and I could hear from the slight tremble in their voice that they were livid. They start almost yelling at me saying that basically they submitted an $8000 order on behalf of a customer of theirs for some commercial equipment in 2014 through our competitor. Basically right before the competitor went under, they made this sale and based on the customer's needs the order was completely wrong and incompatible with what they were going to use it for. However, they only just now realized it was wrong because their customer got arrested in 2014 as the items made their way to his location, and he was in jail for three years. Once he came out, he opened the package only to find the equipment was wrong. So he started yelling and said, \"I swear to God you better let me speak to your manager or ELSE!\". I almost thought I was on Punked. He yelled and yelled and basically all I could say was he had to buy new equipment through us. We have a 30 day policy to report wrong items, and even then we are VERY reasonable and do up to 4 months or so just because we're doing so well... but three years...and you went with our competitor and you want to blame US for it? \n\nSome people!\n\n**tl;dr** Company we bought out sent $8000 usd in wrong equipment three years ago. Customer was arrested so they never opened the box. They get out of jail - open it and are livid and blame us. ",

        "text": "LTL FTP\n\nI work for a call center that handles the national reservation line for a hotel brand. Being a pseudo employee of the hotel, there are some things I'm limited from doing. (Such as fixing Booking/Expedia/Orbitz/ect. reservations)\n\nThe week before this story, I had purchased myself a $30 Casio watch to help me start on time and take full breaks. I was enjoying the feeling of professionalism wearing a mostly metal watch gave me and I didn't have to feel under pressure to keep my breaks short.\n\nOne day, around 2200 my time, I received a call with bad reception and some background noise from the weather.\n\nCG: Clueless Guest\n\nFD: Front Desk\n\nMe: Cersox\n\nTL: Team Leader for group nearby me\n\n&gt;Me: [*beep* Location *beep*] Hi, thank you for calling [Brand, Location] my name is Cersox. How may I help you today?\n\n&gt;CG: Hi, I have a reservation for tonight at your location and I want to let you know I'll be arriving late.\n\nOkay, no problems so far. We have plenty of people who arrive late and it's just a matter of placing a note for the auditor.\n\n&gt;Me: I'll be happy to help hold your room until you arrive. Could you spell your last name so I know I'm writing it correctly?\n\n&gt;CG: Sure, it's G-U-E-S-T and it's from tonight until Sunday.\n\n&gt;Me: Alright, let me just pull up your reservation real quickly.\n\nNo such reservation appears in our system for this location. I happen to know there is another location a mile away that is often confused for this one so I ask while broadening my search.\n\n&gt; Me: And this was for our [X] street location, right?\n\n&gt; CG: Yes, I had a reservation from Expedia at your [X] street location, but I saw your rates were better than Expedia so I had the Front Desk make me a new reservation.\n\nAlright, so this is starting to make more sense. I start searching all arrivals for our [X] st. location and none are listed under CG's name or any potential misspellings.\n\n&gt; Me: And this reservation was definitely under your name, right? Nobody else would have their name on this reservation?\n\n&gt; CG: No! Why is it taking you so long to find my reservation? \n\n&gt; Me: Well CG, I don't see your reservation in our system. Are you sure it was our hotel and not another brand?\n\n&gt; CG: Yes! I called the hotel directly and asked to get a room for the rate I saw online because it was better than the Expedia rate. They said they did it and I can go ahead and cancel my Expedia reservation. Now I want you to find my room! It's raining and I don't want to be out here anymore!\n\nBy this point I've pulled up their cancelled reservation (the only one under their name) and am reading through the details and history.\n\n&gt; Me: I understand completely, would you mind if I put you on a brief hold while I do some digging and figure out what happened to your room?\n\n&gt; CG: Fine.\n\n&gt; Me: Alright, please hold.\n\nI call up the main line for our [X] street location and the phones are down. Next I check our alerts and see that this location has been having power issues for a couple of days and isn't accepting guests. I also notice that the location listed on the cancelled reservation is the [Y] st. location.\n\n&gt; Me: Thank you very much for holding, sorry about the wait. I've done some reading in your reservation details and I see that your room was set up for the [Y] st. location.\n\n&gt; CG: I WAS JUST THERE AND THEY SAID THEY DIDN'T HAVE A RESERVATION FOR ME!\n\n&gt; Me: I don't see an active reservation for you and that's all they would have been searching for. You say the person you talked you said you would be in the same room at the same location?\n\n&gt; CG: Yes.\n\n&gt; Me: Alright, would you mind if I put you on another brief hold while I check on what's happening at our [Y] st. location?\n\n&gt; CG: I just want a room, can't you get me a room there?\n\n&gt; Me: Unfortunately, our [X] st. location is unable to take reservations due to a power issue on site.\n\nNote: We are not allowed to say we are at a remote reservations location because the brand is directing us to give the illusion of all calls lead to the front desk. It's probably in the top 3 most idiotic policies I've ever heard of, but those are the rules. It's impossible to sell. I have received calls for a location and been asked if there's a specific store across the street. I can't answer as fast as a local.\n\n&gt; CG: But you're talking to me!\n\n&gt; Me: I'm at the Reservations Desk off-site. If you'll just give me a moment, I'll check on our [Y] st. location.\n\n&gt; CG: FIne\n\nI put the guest on hold again and try to contact the front desk. After a couple of tries, I get through.\n\n&gt; FD: Front Desk\n\n&gt; Me: This is Cersox in Reservations. I have a guest on the line who said she had a reservation for your location.\n\n&gt; FD: Yeah, I know who you're talking about. She's actually at the [X] location.\n\n&gt; Me: No, her original reservation was set for your location. She said her new reservation was supposed to be for the same location.\n\n&gt; FD: Well we're full here and we've got a waiting list. She needs to go to the [X] location.\n\nFD hangs up before I can explain the [X] location can't accept guests due to a power outage. At this point, I'm angry and not understanding how the situation got to where it is.\n\n&gt; Me: Thank you very much for holding. I have checked in with our front desk and they're saying your only reservation was the cancelled out one.\n\n&gt; CG: I told you, now can you tell me what happened to my room?\n\n&gt; Me: Alright, can you walk me through what they said when you changed your reservation?\n\n&gt; CG: Why? You can see everything so why can't you just get my room?\n\nAt this point, I've taken off my watch and have started twisting the wristband in my hands.\n\n&gt; Me: I need to know what they told you so I can figure out what I'm missing.\n\n&gt; CG: Just get me my room!\n\nHere is where I break my watch's aluminium wristband in sheer frustration.\n\n&gt; Me: Just tell me what they said. Did you get a new email with a confirmation number? Anything?\n\n&gt; CG: No, they said it would be the same number.\n\nWait... What????? I search my system by her confirmation number and only the cancelled one shows up.\n\n&gt; Me: The only room with this confirmation number is the Expedia reservation.\n\n&gt; CG: What do you mean?\n\nSuddenly, a lightbulb goes off. I recheck the history of the reservation and see the rate was changed to the standard rate before being cancelled. Next I call over the nearest TL to help me figure out my next move.\n\n&gt; TL: What's happening Cersox?\n\n&gt; Me: Unless I'm wrong, it looks like this clerk just changed the rate of an Expedia reservation to be the standard rate.\n\n&gt; TL: Yeah, they screwed it up.\n\n&gt; Me: So what can I do to help this guest who can't go to [X] location due to power issues and [Y] location turned them away?\n\nAt this point, the wristband of the watch is a bunch of small bits in my fist and on the floor\n\n&gt; TL: Well, first stop breaking your watch. You've gotta either try to get [Y] location to give them a room or tell the guest to book elsewhere.\n\nSo now I'm redialing the [Y] location and throwing the rest of the watch bits on the floor.\n\n&gt; FD: Front desk, can you hold?\n\n&gt; Me: No, it's Cersox from Reservations again. You need to get CG a room.\n\n&gt; FD: We can't, we're overbooked and she doesn't have a reservation.\n\n&gt; Me: I don't care, your people broke it so you fix it. I don't care how.\n\nAt this point, the TL tells me to go into an aux to cool off after the call. I nod and set myself to the break aux for after the call.\n\n&gt; Me: Thank you for holding CG, sorry about the extended wait. I've figured out what's happened. When the clerk told you the rates were changed, you cancelled the reservation, right?\n\n&gt; CG: Yeah?\n\n&gt; Me: Well, when they told you to do that, they'd only changed the price. When Expedia cancelled the room, they gave us the reservation number. Since the reservation was the same one just with a different price tag. So you ended up cancelling the reservation because the clerk screwed it up.\n\n&gt; CG: So what do I do now?\n\n&gt; Me: At this point, I've exhausted all of my options. Try to reserve through a third-party since I can only see [Brand] exclusive rooms. Otherwise, grab whatever brand hotel rooms you can find.\n\nThe guest ends the call (almost 50 minutes from start to finish), I gather up the bits of watch from the ground and throw it away. Then I go into the breakroom and start a small marathon of multi-lingual cursing. \n\nTL;DR\n\nGuest can't get a room because idiot clerk screwed up and now I have to clean the mess. Watch dies from me restraining my rage at the compounded stupidity.",

Then this happens. \n\nTithing man: hey! 10% is what you should be tithing to the church! \n\nMe: Oh. Neat. OK, so you'll receive $xxxx.xx. Expect to receive it by Monday. \n\nTM: ok. Do you tithe to your church? \n\nMe: oh... Erm... I'm not comfortable discussing that sir. \n\nTM: that's a no (chuckle). You really need to do that. Churches are not funded the way they should be. \n\nMe: non-committal noise. \n\nTM: So, can you promise me that you'll tithe to your church next Sunday? What church do you attend? \n\nMe: sir, your transaction has been processed. Is there anything else I can help you with? \n\nTM: Yes. What church do you attend? I want to be comfortable knowing my money is handled by good Christian people. \n\nMe: I'm not comfortable discussing my religious affiliation with you. Is there anything 401k related I can discuss with you? \n\nTM: You aren't one of those atheists, are you? \n\nMe: if there is nothing more I can discuss with you about your 401k, let's disconnect the call. \n\nTM: I need you to cancel the transaction we just processed and transfer me to someone more trustworthy. \n\nMe: I'm sorry, what? \n\nTM: I don't know who you think you are touching my money. You could be doing anything with it! Transfer me to someone else! RIGHT NOW. \n\nMe: (at this point, I'm befuddled.

        "text": "I work for a call center at a home warranty. We deal with appliances. I had a ton of small, weird calls today. So now, I share them with you.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nYesterday, I had to leave a message for a grown adult explaining that washing the cable from your coffee maker to the outlet on a regular basis is not recommended. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nToday's tales started *off* with the first call where a customer tried some good ol' fashioned insurance fraud.They called in wanting it transferred, I was getting some information, when they told me the technician said that it was a manufacturer's defect. We don't cover for manufacturer's defect. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nCustomer: \"Well . . . what if it *wasn't* a manufactuer's defect?\"\nMe: . . . \"Excuse me?\"\nCustomer \"What if it turned into normal wear and tear?\"\nMe: . . . \"Yeah . . . that's not a thing that happens.\"\nCustomer: \"Well, the technician put *down* that it was a manufacturer's defect so the manufacturer would cover it, but he didn't explain wha tthe defect was to me.\"\nMe: (Thinking loudly: Telling the manufacturer one thing and us another? Yeahhhhh, that would be fraud). \"Well . . . if he wants to talk to us, we're willing to talk to him. But I'm not transferring this without more explanation.\"\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nEither the next call or the call after that the customer called in. Customer: \"I have a leaking water heater.\" \nMe: \"Okay.\"\nCustomer: \"You guys installed it two years ago.\" \nMe: \"That probably means it's under manufacturer's warranty which your plan doesn't cover for.\"\nCustomer: \"Well, this technician installed a bigger water heater and it came out of the technician's basement!\"\nMe: . . . -______- *calls technician* \"Yeah, so I know this is going to *sound* like a stupid question, but did you guys install a bigger water heater from the technician's basement two years ago?\"\nSecretary: \"Are you serious?\"\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nA few work orders later. \nTechnician calls in: \"So we have the customer's approval of not covered cost and we've been approved, so everything should be good to go.\"\nMe: \"Welllll . . . . I see that we approved the labor, the freon, and the leak search. But I don't see that we paid you for the parts. And I don't see that we have a purchase order for them either soooo . . . \" *thinking loudly: unless you have a magical land of HVAC parts from Narnia, somebody needs to pay for those too*\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThen I had a follow up. A customer claimed up and down. \"Your technician came, didn't do anything, blah blah blah. I got a technician out, he ran a sewer cable and hydrojetted, and that fixed the issue.\" I read the work order - our technician said there was a broken pipe that needed to be fixed and the customer needed to pay for it. The customer wanted a trade call fee waived, so I told him to send in the invoice. I got the invoice today and it said: \"Ran a sewer cable an dfound a broken pipe the customer didn't want to pay for.\" Me: -_____- How did you think this was going to go? Did you think I wasn't going to . . . *read* this? \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAt that point I looked over at my calendar: \"Is it a full moon today? Nope, just a bunch of weirdos.\"\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI had a customer angry because I hadn't followed up with her this coming Wednesday. I had to explain that today is *MONDAY*, that I didn't have an update because the work was going to be done today, I'm out of the office tomorrow, so I will follow up, like I said before, on the actual Wednesday, not the pretend Wednesday. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nOne of my last customers involved a technician who just decided they were too busy to call us, so they replaced a $700 thermostat without talking to us. -________-  Yeah, that's not how this is supposed to work. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nEssentially the plan holder said it failed from normal usage, the technician said someone told them it was broken by a dog and they were \"too busy\" to call us for a report so they just replaced it. The technician was like, \"I don't get why this is a big deal.\" \nMe: \"Well, for starters, typically speaking once work is done, whether it's covered or not, we tend to cover for it.\" Technician: \"Ooooooh.\" \nMe: \"Yeahhh, you need to not do this again.\" \nCustomer was like: \"Well, i'll just have them come back out and uninstall it then and we can do this again.\" \nMe: *rolling my eyes* \"Yeah, we're not going to do that. The deed is done.\" \nFortunately for me, a higher authority than I took it over, so it's now officially Someone Else's Problem.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI was talking to my supervisor about the call with the thermostat and one of my coworkers happened to be standing there. I got to the point where i was explaining *how* the replacement of the thermostat had happened and she was like: \"Wait . . . what?\" I was like \"Yeah, welcome to my day today.\" \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSometimes I swear dispatch gives me these calls for their own amusement.

        "text": "Like I said on the free talk thread on friday about this gem I was gonna post it. Well sorry for the delay just had some stuff on the weekend ,but here goes the story about how we got a fake doctor and how he was shut down.\n\nJust to give you some pre game here basically I help in the doctors office and he does promote several products and such. Normally my duties are screening calls from sales from appointments its not normal I get a screaming person that gets contacted by our marketing team and I get those calls ,but I don't mind to much the pay here is pretty good. Anywho it was on this day I get a call from someone that dealt with our Customer Loyalty team. The fake doctor will be FD.\n\nMe: Thank you for calling such and such my name is Ruised how can I help.\n\nFD: Hello is the doctor in I would like to make a complaint about the product.\n\n\"Normally hes not in cause he practices open heart surgery and such\"\n\nMe: The doctor isn't currently in right at the moment how can I help you?\n\nFD: Yea I was wondering about the product and why it is expired you guys follow FDA policies abut this why are you giving me expired product?\n\n\"Okay so basically the item he gotten wasn't any food and drug item so its not regulated by FDA but by third party testing instead\" \n\nMe: I'm sorry about that what is the name of the product so I can check here?\n\nFD: its called ******* it shows a MFD of 06/16/2017\n\n\"So its not a expiration date cause its not a medication but the manufactoring date so the product is good for two years of that date. \n\nMe: I see that is the manufactoring date sir sorry for the confusion there.\n\nFD: Well I was told by the company I get a fresh batch as a doctor... \n\n\"Got to it eventually this what he said afterwards\"\n\nFD: With 45 years of micobiotics and other medical studies with 3 Master degrees and two bachelors and I know the doctor that support this product and I'm appalled that he would support this.\n\n\"At this point and time I was wondering about that cause he said he was apart of the same alumni that our doctor belonged to and they talk on a day to day basis ,but the doctor never mentioned him to us. So I wrote his name down cause I was odd about this.\n\nMe: Sorry that they didn't give you the correct information but the product is still good for two year--\n\nFD: Just so you know I have those degrees and masters I know more about this than you do so you shut up and as someone who knows more than you will explain it.\n\n\"Yea I was taken apart by this but at the same time I was listening the doctor walked in on his day off just to pick up something and say hello so I stopped the doctor and gave him the name of the guy to see if he knew him. He left for abit and I was still talking to the guy on the phone.\n\nFD: --- and also just to let you know the shipping warehouse called me directly cause they know my time is valuable and offered me fresh product and also free bottles. \n\nMe: Ohh they did...\n\n\"They don't call out to customers\"\n\nMe: That was our marketing department not the warehouse sir...I just asked them if they made a call. \n\nFD: Look I don't know who called me but they offered me free product and a fresh batch.\n\n\"At this point I was getting like....uggh but the doctor came back and asked me to give him the phone he put a note on my desk and shows that the guy wasn't even a doctor nor had a practice nor was he ever in the alumni at all!\" At this point I could hear snipets of what he was saying but the doctor was probing him about where his practice was and almuni stuff. At this time I looked it up according to the notes and saw that it was an apartment building near a pizza hut. The doctor gives me the phone after telling me to say the rest of the note.\n\nMe: Sorry about that sir my boss wanted me to let you know you can email him at this following email address. at suppor...\n\nFD: How do you spell support?\n\n\"He couldn't spell support but....he has 5 degrees.....\"\n\nMe: Su...\n\nFD: FU?\n\nMe: No Su...pport..\n\nFD: Ohh support...how you spell that?\n\n\"This goes on for a few minutes\"\n\nMe: Okay just email him that sir he knows you are gonna contact him...by the way...\n\nHere goes\n\nMe: My doctor wanted me to why are you lying about your profession sir he said he doesn't know you and anything.\n\n\"Five minutes later he called his alumni with the guys name and apparently this guy been doing this for awhile\"\n\nFD: Uhh huhhhh...ya know my time is valuable don't harass me and such!!! I'm suing your company!! *Hangs up*\n\nOverall it was a fun call so we did more we blocked him from calling us and also ordering product cause he was reselling to so that was awesome to have the doctor and me shut him down. \n\n\nTLDR: Guy claimed to be a doctor to get free product our doctor came in and verified he wasn't got caught is banned from buying things from us.

This is a short story of what happened when my ISP stopped providing full support for Third Party Email Programs and a customer was confronted with this fact in front of a fellow agent.\n\nPlayers:\n\n$Wrath: Me from 5 years ago!\n\n$Sunshine: A techy friend/co-worker who not only helped mentor me in my early days of support but somehow is still a genuinely good person.  Plays a lesser role in this story, but its her reaction that makes it worth telling.\n\n$Customer: The poor soul who got to deal with me instead of sunshine.\n\n&gt; **$Sunshine is on break and hanging out near my desk, she was talking to me about how the change in process is starting to get to her and several of my co-workers.  They seem to be having trouble telling a customer 'no I cant help you' and its fraying at their nerves.**\n\n&gt; **Then it happens.  The dreaded beep of the phone signaling a new call has been routed to my desk.  Ah well..**\n\n&gt; $Me: Hello this is $ISP technical support, $Wrath speaking. May i start by getting your name and your account number please?\n\n&gt; **I say this part fluidly, and in 'the phone voice' which would take some explaining.  The short version is when i talk in the voice to someone who hasnt heard it before they pretty much have to stop and listen.**\n\n&gt; $Customer: Oh.. well.. Im having trouble with my email.\n\n&gt; $Wrath:  Id be happy to help, but I need to find your account first, if you dont know your account number I can find you by your email address.\n\n&gt; **$Sunshine clues into my side of the conversation as soon as i mention email, we have been getting flooded with email calls all day and all of them are exactly the same.  She shoots me a look of sympathy.**\n\n&gt; $Customer: My email address is firstname_lastname @ ISP . com\n\n&gt; $Wrath: Thank you, and how can I help?\n\n&gt; **Sunshine notices that i dont appear to be dreading this conversation and gets a puzzled look on her face**\n\n&gt; $Customer: Well i just had my computer fixed and I want to set up my email. **The customer used THAT tone.  The one where this should have been obvious and i must clearly be an idiot, it was obvious but im not about to give her an inch of leeway.  Game on.**\n\n&gt; $Wrath: I see.. And how can I help?  **I spike up the cheer in my tone as i ask the same question again.**\n\n&gt; $Customer: I.. **She is obviously confused** I have this outlook program on my computer and i want you to help me set it up.\n\n&gt; **$Sunshine is worried.  She knows that i dont have a soul anymore.  And my smile is freaking her out.**\n\n&gt; $Wrath: Ah.  Well unfortunately $Customer I wont be able to help you with that.  As of 3 days ago $ISP no longer offers support for those programs and I can no longer directly assist you with them.  However we do still have step by step instructions on our websi..\n\n&gt; **$Customer cuts me off, I let her.  Ive taken enough of these calls that ive begun to enjoy it.** What do you mean you cant help?  Someone else there helped me set it up last month!\n\n&gt; $Wrath: Yes, I can see that in your ticket history.  Someone was able to help you last month.  Unfortunately I cant help you with it now with the changes at $ISP.  However if you like i can show you where to go on our website to find the setup instructions or I can show you how to use the..\n\n&gt; $Customer: But why cant you help me now?  One of the other agents just helped me!\n\n&gt; Wrath: A few days ago $ISP has decided that we would no longer be able to directly support Third Party email programs.  They are simply too diverse these days and we dont have access to enough of them to be able to reliably help when something goes wrong.\n\n&gt; $Customer: I want you to help me set up my email!\n\n&gt; $Wrath: Of course!  If you like I can show you where on our website..\n\n&gt; $Customer: I dont want to go to your website.  I want to use my program.\n\n&gt; **Im grinning like a maniac, $Sunshine is stuck staring at me with a look somewhere between awe and fear.**\n\n&gt; $Wrath: You can still use your program of course.  I just cant directly assist you in setting it up.\n\n&gt; $Customer: But i want to use the program.  **The customer is shouting, its music to my ears**\n\n&gt; $Wrath: Of course.  So are there any other troubles I may be able to help you with today?.\n\n&gt; **$Sunshine's jaw dropped**\n\n&gt; $Customer: No! I want to set up my email on this program!\n\n&gt; $Wrath: Is there anything else I may be able to help you with today? **I find repeating this question is a very effective hint.**\n\n&gt; $Customer: No just this.\n\n&gt; $Wrath: Alright, well then have a fantastic day! **The company says I cant end the call myself, the customer has to be the one to do it.   I cant hide the glee in my voice.**\n\n&gt; **There is a short pause as she eventually clued in she wasnt going to get anywhere with me**\n\n&gt; $Customer: So.. you wont help me?\n\n&gt; $Wrath: With an unsupported problem?  Im terribly afraid im not allowed to do so.\n\n&gt; **I can hear her eye twitching as $Customer hangs up the phone.  I look to $Sunshine.  $Sunshine is stunned.  I smile even wider, a shark would wince.**\n\n&gt; $Sunshine: .. Can.. Can I just transfer all of these calls to you?\n\n&gt; $Wrath: Absolutely.\n\nIn the end because what she and many like her were asking was now explicitly not supported I took a few hundred calls that all were pretty much scripted exactly like this.  The customers expected me to have to bow to their demand.  I didnt and I wasnt required to because of the companies new rules as long as i stayed relatively professional.  \n\nI enjoyed it.\n\n.. Im not a nice person.",

Now a little background: In order ot use our internet we, like most companies, had minimum standards your computers needed to meet. At this time it was XP SP2 and above, a 1  Ghz proc, and 512 Mb of ram. This user checked off most of these requirements, but not all. And this brings us to the start of our woeful tale...\n\n\nCast of characters:\n\nme: just me, myself, and I (yes there are three of me, I don't care if its just in my head! We all agree...mostly!)\n\n\nlg: linux guy. One of those users that just makes all tech geeks look bad!\n\n\nT3: the tier three tech, they were the guys that took on the hard stuff!\n\nAnd now, on with our story!\n\n\n&gt;me: *whisper tone tells me its from Syracuse* Thank you for calling ISP national help desk, this is Peopleman_at_work. So that I can best assist you, can you please tell me your name and the telephone number starting with the area code that is on your account?\n\n\n&gt;lg: Yes, my name is **NAME** and my phone number is **PHONE NUMBER MINUS THE AREA CODE**\n\n\n&gt;me: Thank you for that sir, but since I am a national help desk, I do not know the area code that you are calling from, may you please tell me that?\n\n\n&gt;lg: Oh, yeah **proceeds to tell me zip code**\n\n\n&gt;me: Sir, that was your postal zip code, I need to know the three digit code that precedes your phone number.\n\n\n&gt;lg: Oh, I feel like an idiot, its **315**.\n\n\n&gt;me: Thank you, and seems to be the issue?\n\n\n&gt;lg: Well, I go to school for engineering, and I just got this new laptop. I installed red hat, and now I can't get online! Since your my ISP, I figured this is something that you *HAD* to fix!\n\n\n&gt;me: *internally thinking, Why did you think we would support Linux?* OK sir, I will absolutely try to help, but there is no guarantee since we do not support Linux, and I'm not that familiar with it.\n\n\n&gt;lg: No, you will support it! I come from New York City, I know your CEO. He told me that you will fix it!\n\n\n*at this point in my service, I had been warned about people from this city attempting to gain leverage by claiming to know the CEO. It was never EVER true!*\n\n\n&gt;me: We treat all our customers the same, and always do our best to achieve 100% satisfaction, but there are just some things that we are unable to help with because we do not support them. But lets see if this is something I can fix!\n\n\n&gt;lg: NO! YOU WILL BE FIXING THIS! I DON'T CARE ABOUT WHAT YOU SUPPORT YOU WILL FIX THIS NOW!!!11!! I HAVE PAPERS TO WRITE AND MORE IMPORTANT THINGS I HAVE TO DO SO THAT I DON'T END UP LIKE WORTHLESS TECH SUPPORT PEOPLE LIKE YOURSELVES!!!\n\n\n&gt;me: Sir, there is no need to shout, or belittle me! I was just making you aware that this is not something we normally do, but that I would still try.\n\n\n&gt;lg: Fine, but if you can't fix this you will transfer me to someone that can!\n\n\n&gt;me: Certainly sir. now, I just want to start at the beginning. Is this a Ethernet connection, or a wireless one?\n\n\n&gt;lg: obviously its wireless, who in their right mind would ever connect wired in this day and age? That is a dumb question!\n\n\n&gt;me: Thank you for that. Now on Red Hat, does it have anything similar to Windows where it will show the status of the connection?\n\n\n&gt;lg: Not graphically! And I don't know the command to do it via the command line.\n\n\n&gt;me: OK, no problem, I will just see if I can look it up! please hold for 1 minute. *puts call immediately on hold*\n\n\nI sit there for a moment just enjoying the silence, and then googleFU my way to an answer.\n\n\n&gt;me: *breaths deep, and takes call off hold* Thank you for holding sir. I have looked up the information. Can you please type in the following *lspci*. Please tell me if it shows your wireless network card, or NIC?\n\n\n&gt;lg: No, I don't see it listed! WHY the F**K isn't it listed?\n\n\n&gt;me: I don't know sir, but since we have now seen that it is your computer not seeing the interface, I will be unable to assist further, since we do not state we support Linux. You might want to try contacting either the manufacturer of your computer, or if you can find it, a local repair shop that knows Linux.\n\n\n&gt;lg: This is unaccecptable. Transfer me to someone who knows what they are doing. You just don't want to help me since I'm Asian! \n\n\n&gt;me: Sir, I did not know that you were Asian, and even if I did this would not have anything to do with what I said. But if you like I will attempt to reach out to my tier 3 team for further assistance. \n\n\n&gt;lg: Yes, I do not like talking to racists like you. Get me some Asian that knows what they are doing!\n\n\n&gt;me: *thinking, now who's racist* Please hold the line while I see if tier 3 will take the call. *puts call on hold and dials the tier 3 extension*\n\n\n&gt;t3: Thank you for calling tier three tech support for ISP, this is T3, how can I help you?\n\n\n&gt;me: Hey t3, this is me from the national help desk. I have a customer that has Red Hat on his computer and he is demanding we fix his computer not seeing his NIC. Can you help? \n\n\n&gt;t3: This guy? he has called 4 times and won't listen to us. *gets evil tone in his voice* Did he call you a racist, and ask to be transferred to a Asian yet?\n\n\n&gt;me: Yeah, how did you know?\n\n\n&gt;t3: he has done this every single time. I think its time we taught him a lesson! Put him thru.\n\n\n&gt;me: I'm intrigued, but here he is in 3...2...1...*transfers call*\n\n\nFrom what I heard from the t3's supervisor, t3 put on a fake Asian accent, and told the customer that we do not support linux and that he cannot get us to do it for him. The customer accepted this, but the t3 decided to end the call in his normal american/white accent. this got lg so angry that he demanded to disconnect, so he was transferred to the retention line.\n\n\nso there you have it dear readers. The time that I got yelled at, called a racist and an idiot all in one call for not supporting Linux. I would like to say this was the last time this happened, but we all know that this is just not so. ",

        "text": "Apologies in advance if this turns into an interminable rant...  \n\nI'm a T2 agent at a major insurance company. Basically, my job is to answer questions from agents, handle escalations and complex investigations, and reprocess certain types of claims.  \nMy team leader left on a (MUCH needed) 3 week vacation two weeks ago and left me in charge of a couple of things to make sure the team doesn't utterly collapse while she's away (mainly going over open cases with teammates and making sure things get done fast and efficiently, assisting them and doing P2P shadowing). She also left two other TLs in charge of the rest of her duties, mostly on the administrative and schedule-planning side of things which I can't access, as well as being my resource-persons in case I needed help while she was gone. I thought this would be relatively easy, as I had handled similar tasks before, though never for such an extended period of time. I could not have been more wrong...  \n\nThe TLs she left in charge were supposed to send me *daily* reports that I was to use in order to do case reviews, in the past two weeks, I have received only four of them. One of the TLs (let's call her A) is chronically ignoring my e-mails and is in a different city, so I cannot go ask her directly for them, and the other one (let's call him B) is...well...useless to the point that I had to give up asking him for anything, because nothing ever got done and I ended up too frustrated for nothing.   \nSo I've been working off of week-old reports that at this point are completely useless, and improvising as I go for the rest, which is less than ideal. Now TL B, who is in charge of schedules, forgot to add my 2.5h/day of offline backup work for the entirety of next week, which, knowing our scheduling department, means they'll probably update it Monday and cut it back to an hour because they didn't plan accordingly. On top of that, TL A decided that since one of my teammates is going on vacation for the next two weeks, I should be assigned his open cases. This was purely an executive decision she made, without consulting me to see if I could actually take them on (I also have my own dozen open cases to handle) and sent me an e-mail right before she left to tell me basically \"here you go, handle these and have a good weekend\". The way we usually handle it, is between ourselves in the team, we'll ask around to see who could take them, and assign them to that person; TLs are very rarely involved in that process, since there should be no need for them to be.  \nSo yeah...for the next week, I'm basically going to be swimming neck-deep in work, with almost zero support, and probably logging a LOT of overtime...This is by far the worst back-up experience I've had, and I'm definitely going to be meeting with my TL about it once she is back, but for now, all I can do is hope I don't have a mental breakdown by mid-week.   \n\nThe only thing to look forward to is the fact that in 3 and a half months, I will be quitting this miserable job forever and going to culinary school (my boss doesn't know about that yet, but it's going to be part of that long meeting when she's back...).\n\n",

I shouldn't be punished for a fib! \n\nFraud: tough luck. You lied. \n\nThe ghost lady hung up and all was right in the world.",

That's clearly an obvious conclusion most any employee would come to, it's a well known fact that work life is less than desirable. \nHowever, some things you just aren't ever really going to be prepared for. \n\nOne of the most difficult calls I've ever had to take was while I was working in a program for a bigger name credit card company. This sweet older lady called in to apply for a card, and I immediately was in a good mood. I did my utmost to help her find an appropriate product, no intent to upsell or anything. Eventually we got to the reason why she was applying for the card in the first place. \n\nTurns out she worked in the masonry business and was planning on purchasing some stone directly from a quarry and needed a line of credit of at least $3000 for the purchase. I was intrigued and we talked about that line of work for a bit, and eventually she laid out the rest of the story of me.\n\nTurns out she was purchasing the stone so she could make a headstone, for her young grandson. \n\nI was absolutely gutted. I finished with the call and she got the card and the line of credit she needed.. I've never been so upset and I guess content(?) with the call.\n\nCalls like that aren't common, but they do happen, and sometimes they really hurt. I've not particularly had a great time with this line of work. These types of interactions make you appreciate the people you talk to, and work as a reminder that they're actual people. Not everyone is just an ass who is wasting your time, and sometimes people experience tragedy.\n\nJust a reminder, life exists outside of the walls of your prison. Sometimes it's easy to believe the world consists of you and the ghosts of people talking to you through a plastic headset. But reality isn't Schrodinger's Cat, the world is alive in the box. \n\nKeep on doing things I guess.",

So, just like I usually do, I put the customer on hold and initiated a transfer. The person on the other end answered with the \"opening a new call\" speech rather than the much more casual \"accepting a transfer\" one, but that happens sometimes when someone's not looking at their screen.\n\nMe: \"Hey, this is u/WeaponizedOrigami in the [location] office and I have a [policy type] call.

Do I need to schedule a callback?\"\n\nPerson: \"Yes, we're going to schedule you for a callback.

Am I unable to transfer at all, or did I call the wrong place?\"\n\nPerson: \"Unfortunately I'm unable to transfer you at this time, but if you'll give me your name and phone number-\"\n\nAt that point I cancelled the transfer, double-checked the extension, and attempted to transfer again.

Well I get this call from a customer that is furious his house is being foreclosed for not paying his mortgage.\n\nSo I review his account.  This guy would send his payments out  to be received on the 16th of the month BEFORE it was due.  Mortgages almost always due on the 1st.  This guy was sending his around 15 days early.  He was doing it for years.  Well one day the 16th was a banking holiday plus weekend and our system set the payment to be received on the 14th to make sure it gets there in time.  Then it sent the following payment to be received on the 16th like normal\n\n6 months late he has 6 late fees and now the bank is starting to foreclose on his home for 6 late payments in a row.  This guy starts out furious our system failed him.  I explained what happened and that the bank received every payment, and I can prove it.  He begins to calm down ad I start prepping proof of payment requests so we can prove the bank was payed.  Further more to help the guy I conferenced in a rep from his bank that owns his mortgage.   This lady is horribly annoyed to have to speak to this guy again.  But he is confident with me telling him I can prove they were payed.  \n\nThe bank rep initially denies them ever receiving a payment on the 14.  So I give the check information they signed and cashed.  So she places us on hold and goes to review this.  Then comes back laughing.\n\nWell since the bank received the payment too early it applied the payment to principal and not as his monthly payment.  His next payment is sent to be received on the  16th the following month and accrued as late. \n\nShe was said this is ours and his fault since their rules say they can apply payment however they want if received before the 15th.  Refuses to help in any way and finally hangs up on us.\n\nSo the guy now reasonably upset.  I offer to call bank and see if we can get her supervisor and get this cleared.  But the guy is defeated for right now and tells me he will call us back the next day.\n\nI never found out what happened to this guy, but I doubt he won.\n",

The trainee I'm sitting with is taking her assessment later today so my headset is around my neck. I'm there for moral support and to answer potential questions/offer guidance on a tough call. \n\nShe gets a call and I start paying a little bit more attention to her but I'm still talking to this guy about my escalation. My trainee places the caller on hold, looks at me and says that she doesn't understand what the caller wants. \n\nMe: I'm pretty sure she's calling about a pending withdrawal. \n\nTrainee: How did you get that? I thought I heard her say something about enrolling her account but it's already enrolled. \n\nMe: Well, let's just look at the work queue and see what's there. \n\nTrainee navigates to the work queue. We see a pending withdrawal request. I remember hearing the caller say something about being locked out from being able to submit something. I tell the trainee that I think the caller wants to submit a 2nd withdrawal request but she can't because the first one is still pending. If that's the case, she'll need to send an email.\n\nThe trainee is hesitant but she brings the caller back on the line and begins to ask some probing questions (at my prompting) and guess what? I was totally right lol. The call ends and the trainee looks at me with wide eyes. \n\nTrainee: How did you do that? You were having a completely separate conversation! You didn't even have your headset on. I was actively listening and I didn't even know what she wanted. \n\nMe: Been here a few years. It gets easier with time. :)\n\nInternal Me: Quick!

        "text": "Hello! I'm a Universal agent for a $MajorTelco. My position includes transfers of service, corporate escalations, tier 1 and 2 support for Cable, HSI, and VoIP, and various special projects. I'm usually part of the team that pilots new departments. I also take overflow calls for the self-service team who answer calls when the self service app for billing/repair fails to resolve the issue.  Now that we've gotten the preamble out of the way, onward with the story.\n\n\nOne of the aforementioned \"Special Projects\" I support is placing outbound calls when a customer requests services at an address that already has an active customer. We call to confirm with the existing customer if they're moving/disconnecting their services/trying to get a better deal/if the call is even valid. The problem with these outbound calls is that most of the time the customer is extremely confused, swearing up and down they've already disconnected their account. This is one of those times. I will referring to the customer as $DC in this tale.\n\n\n&gt;$LullabyBunny: \"Hello, may I speak with $DC?\"\n\n\n&gt;$DC: \"Yes. Is this $LargeTelco?\"\n\n\n&gt;$LullabyBunny: \"Yes, my name is $LullabyBunny and I'm calling on behalf of the $LargeTelco Mover's Dept. The reason I'm calling you is because we've received an order for services from another customer at your address, which we still show active services for. I'd like to confirm if you will be moving, or not.\"\n\n\n&gt;$DC: \"I **ALREADY** called in and disconnected. The services are shut off. Good day.\"\n\n\n&gt;$LullabyBunny \"Well, with all due respect, if the account was already disconnected, we wouldn't be having this conversation. When did you call in? I do not see that a disconnect order has been put in for your account?\"\n\n\n&gt;$DC: \"Excuse me? I **said** I already called in. The services are shut off. You're interrupting my vacation!\n\n\n&gt;$LullabyBunny: \"I do apologize, but as I stated previously there is no disconnect order on the account. The representative you spoke with may not have put in the order. Now I will be more than happy to process the disconnect order, or transfer your services to a new address since you have moved. May I get you to confirm the last four # of your SSN for account security purposes?\"\n\n\n&gt;$DC \"No, I won't provide that information. The account is already disconnected. I'm going to go about my day now, thank you. I'm really getting fed up with you.\"\n\n\n&gt;$LullabyBunny: \"I must emphasize that no, your account is still in an active state. Not only will you continue to accrue billing, but you're also preventing the new tenant from receiving services. I can have this corrected rather quickly if I can just get you to finish authentication.\"\n\n\nAt this point it becomes a roundabout between the customer and I. They've turned me out, and are repeating themselves, and cutting me off. The call is nearing half an hour when we could have been done with the call about 25 minutes ago.\n\n\n&gt;$DC: \"No, billing has already stopped. The account is disco-\n\n\n&gt;$LullabyBunny: \"If we terminate the call now, you will not only continue to receive further calls from us, you'll also be charged further due to the fact that your services aren't disconnected. If you continue as is, you'll be inconveniencing the other party, and eventually, your bill WILL go to a non-pay disconnect. At that point, your account will be written off due to bad debt, and sent to a third-party collections agency. It will reflect negatively on your credit report, you will receive further calls from the third-party, and you will be unable to reestablish services with $LargeTelco until you not only acknowledge your debt, but pay it off. This will further damage your credit report. Then, we will be forced to run another credit check, hitting your credit a third time, or we'll require a refundable deposit. Now, this entire conversation could have been over half-an-hour ago, but you continue to stonewall me, when I'm simply trying to help you. Others may not be as patient with you as I have. Shall we move forward with the call? Please confirm the last four digits of your SSN.\"\n\n\nThe customer authenticates fully and I thank them for the cooperation.\n\n\n&gt;$LullabyBunny: \"Thank you for fully authenticating your account. Now that I've fully secured the account, I can confirm there is no record of your call, and there is no notation on the account regarding the disconnect of the services. Whomever you spoke to previously didn't even access your account. Moving forward, can you please let me know the exact last day you were at your address for billing purposes?\"\n\n\n&gt;$DC: \"That's nonsense! I spoke with a gentleman and they said the account was already disconnected and everything was good. also why **MORE** questions? Just disconnect it!\n\n\n&gt;$LullabyBunny: \"I truly am sorry they didn't disconnect the account as you requested. I need to know when you moved out so that we can properly backdate the billing. If I disconnect it now, billing will be through today, and you'll have a final balance due. If I backdate the billing, you'll likely be current, or even owed a credit balance because out services are post-dated. \n\n\nIt should be noted that I didn't even have to do that. Despite 30+ minutes of vitriol and stone-walling I'm still keeping the customer's best interests in mind.\n\n\n&gt;$DC \"IDK, I moved out weeks ago! Why does it matter?\"\n\n\n&gt;$LullabyBunny: \"As I mentioned twice before, we need an **exact** date for billing purposes. I am simply trying to help you. Please help me assist you by providing me the exact final day of service so we can bill accordingly.\n\n\n&gt;$DC \"I moved out XX/XX/XXXX.\n\n\n&gt;$LullabyBunny: \"Great! The final bi-\n\n\nAt this point the customer disconnected the call before I could properly explain the equipment return policy. 45 minutes in and my patience has worn thin. I call the customer back and they promptly ignore the call. It rings twice before dropping to VM. I politely apologize for the \"dropped call,\" and explain that they have a credit balance that they can claim once they return their $Telco-Leased Equipment and they can return their equipment to any $TelcoServiceCenter or $MajorShippingCompany free of charge. They have 30 days to return it before they're contacted by the equipment return team regarding the unreturned equipment. I close the ticket and go about my day. ",

I also take overflow calls for the self-service team who answer calls when the self service app for billing/repair fails to resolve the issue.  Now that we've gotten the preamble out of the way, onward with the story.\n\n\nIt's later in to the evening. At this time of day we mostly only receive internal calls from either Activations, or Tier 1. Customers have self-installed and the tier 1 reps need our assistance with the activation. Usually this means manually migrating their equipment from the previous address, and closing the pending WIP. Tier 1 tools are very limited and they're often stonewalled by WIPs, regardless of what the WIP really is. Our second most common call is troubleshooting prior to the move. Occasionally the system erroneously closes their account early, the modem loses its provisioning despite the work order not impacting other services, their phone may drop, or they may lose On Demand or HD. This call is of the latter variety.\n\n\nAfter authenticating the agent and the customer, I'm informed that the customer is unable to surf. The agent starts the normal tier 1 spiel about the account being disconnected early despite the customer having not moved yet. I went over the account and checked both the equipment and the WIP. the account is on the source account and the WIP is future-dated meaning it would not be service impacting.\n\n\n&gt;**$LullabyBunny:**  \"I just finished looking over the account, and there's nothing wrong with this order. The equipment is where it's supposed to be and the WIP is pending for 5/8...\"\n\n\n&gt;**$Tier1:** \"...But it's a pending disconnect...\"\n\n\n&gt;**$LullabyBunny:** \"Yes, the operative word being **PENDING.** I trust you're familiar with the word pending, and its meaning? you **HAVE** looked at the work order, right?\"\n\n\n&gt;**$Tier1:** \"W-well yes, it says here it's for a transfer of service, pending disconnect, effective date 5/8...\"\n\n\n&gt;**$LullabyBunny:** \"Yes! as you can see, there is no problem with the work order. Everything is keyed in correctly and this is non service-impacting until the 8th. What problem is the customer having exactly, and what steps have you taken to assist them?\"\n\n\n&gt;**$Tier1:** \"The customer's internet and phone aren't working. Their TV works fine, they're able to see all of their channels, and their on demand works fine. I tried to run our automated tool, but it's saying the customer is in a non-pay status and it needs to be corrected in the biller.\"\n\n\nI check in the biller, and I'm able to confirm the customer is current. Long-standing customer, pays their bills on time. The type of customer we give the most preferential treatment to in our dept. All is green.\n\n\n&gt;**$LullabyBunny:** \"No, the customer is current. Their autopayment posted already. Refresh your tool and run the diagnostics again. It's probably just the provisioning on the modem.\"  \n\nIt was - I confirmed using my own tools. As a little clarification, Tier 1, and in general, all of our business partners regardless of tier have very locked down access. Their tools are automated, and do the job for them, most of the time. Sometimes the backend system, the biller, and the go between for the biller and our diagnostics systems have a disconnect and improper reporting happens. At this time, Tier1 can no longer do their job. It's very unfortunate because this is where manual provisioning tools shine. Problem with the go-between? Fuck it, fix it directly.\n\n\n&gt;**$Tier1:** \"I tried everything prior to contacting you. I ran the tool, refreshed the tool, exited and re-entered the account, had a colleague take a look on their computer. I wouldn't have contacted you if I could resolve this myself.\"  \n\n\nThis earned major brownie points with me. Most of our Tier 1 reps lack any initiative and often times transfer calls to us that was well within their scope of being able to handle. \n\n\n&gt;**$LullabyBunny:**  \"Alright, I understand. I've manually provisioned the modem for you. Customer's services should be up and running within 3 minutes. I confirmed the modem received the signal and is currently registering back online. Make sure you place an outbound call on the VoIP phone to confirm it works. In the future, remember that if there's a pending disconnect that's future dated that it isn't service impacting, and make sure you read your troubleshooting guide word for word. We get too many calls from agents who could easily have fixed the problem without tying up our lines. Have a nice rest of your shift.  We exchange pleasantries and he returns to his shift. ",

        "text": "I recently left a call center job as I'm relocating later in the month but I'd like to share one of the last calls I took. To set up I worked subcontracted as customer care for a rather small Teleco company that services very limited areas in north eastern U.S. I'll refer to the call as PD.\n\nME: Thank you for calling teleco my name is siloguard and how can I assist you today.\n\nPD: I need to know why yall turned my services off\n\nME: I'll be happy to look at your account to help figure this out can you verify the name and address on the account?\n\nPD: My phone number is 555-555-5555(gave actual phone number but)\n\nME: Thank you for that and the name and address?\n\nPD: I don't know what your going to do with that information.\n\nME: It helps me verify I'm in the right account to give you accurate information\n\nShe sighs and gives me the information so I open her account and start snooping around seeing on her main screen that the account has been set for a total non payed disconnection 2 days later. So I check her past due balance and it is over $800.\n\nME: It looks like your account has been suspended due to having over $800 in past due balances and if you do not pay in the next 2 days your account will be canceled.\n\nPD: I need to get a payment arrangement set up cause thats not fair.\n\nAt this point I explain we can only do an extension for 14 days from the date of suspension and bring up that in fact she had just broken a payment arrangement within the past 90 days.\n\nPD: Ok how much do I need to pay to get services back on?\n\nME: The full past due balance.\n\nAt this point she puts a friend/family member/ good soul on the line who gives me their credit card information to make the payment. That person then puts the customer back on the line.\n\nME: You should see your services return within the next 10-15 minutes. Was there anything else I can assist with today?\n\nPD: I think I deserve 2 months of free service and HBO for the inconvenience of you turning off my services\n\nME: I'm sorry ma'am but we cannot honor that request your account was suspended due to non payment not an error on our side.\n\nPD: Then I need you to lower my bill this is ludicrous.\n\nI look into her promotions and see she was just placed into a new promotional rate 5 months prior. With this company you qualify for a new rate every 3rd year you are with us so I suggested a few premium channels we could remove. This is when she didn't demand a supervisor but the CEO of the company. next part could get kinda long and I'll thank you for making it this far so we're going to kinda TL:DR the end. I get her to where she'll talk to a supervisor place her on hold and call the supe queue. I got one of our more savage supervisors (don't take shit and politely makes you feel dumb as fuck) and only wish I could have heard the end of that convo. \n\nEdit for punctuation also sorry for wall of text",

He is paying $75 for internet which isn't too bad for the speed he has and mentioned I can get it down to about $60 for the internet for 6 months. He then throws a bombshell on me, what about my tv service as well? Looking all around his account he never had tv service not even a box was registered to his account or name. I decided to probe for info and was able to get him to give me the serial number on the box.  Was registered to a lady which happens to be his sister. And looking at her account that box is online and receiving. He was stealing cable from us and his sister gave him the box to plug in.  The line on the outside box ended up being plugged in by him. I immediately turned off his modem and his sisters account.  My supervisor was in the mean time calling the sister to inform them.  We told them that both accounts will be suspended until the 2 years of cable that box has been receiving is paid. This infuriates the sister saying her brother said it was fine as long as she is paying her bill. We had to fax them both the terms of service explicitly banning this action.  The brother ended up paying it in full and decided to get tv and cable. In the end as a bonus they gave me commission on the amount I was able to recover for finding this.  Lesson to be learned, if he wasn't a cheap ass we would of never found out.  Instead of paying less for his bill it went to nearly $ 185 and banned his account for any promotions in the future.  ",

SHE'S GOING TO THE HOSPITAL RIGHT NOW! I'M GONNA SUE YOUR FUCKING ASSES! YOUR BED ALMOST KILLED MY GRANDBABY!!!\"\n\nMy first thought is holy shit, we're liable for an injury. I have to find this lady's account and then turn this call over to the legal department. But first I have to calm her down enough to get her info.\n\n\"That's horrible, ma'am, and I'm so very sorry. In order to start making this right, can I get some information from you please? I'd like to look up your account so I know to whom I'm speaking.\"\n\n\"MY GRANDBABY!

I am going to need some information from you, though.\"\n\nFinally, after about five minutes of this, I get her info and try to look her up, but she's not coming up in our system at all. There's no trace of her, or her daughter and son in law. And the whole time she's still screaming as I tried to look her up.\n\n\"MY GRANDBABY ALMOST DIED ON A BUSTED SPRING IN YOUR BED--\"\n\nOh.\n\n\"Ma'am? Our beds don't have springs in them.

There use to be a campaign for a now out of business store, maybe you guys remember CompUSA? Anyways, I use to answer calls in the \"pricing and availability\" department. Customers would call in with a product ID and a zip code and we would just provide them with that, availability and nothing more, the calls would never be more than 2 minutes long, in fact we never ended calls with \"is there anything else I can assist you with\", we just said \"thanks for calling CUSA\" and it was heaven.\n\n\nSo one day, this guy calls in and asks if we had a specific item (I think it was just a pc with windows xp, no specs or brands), I asked him for the product ID or the name of the specific model he was looking for, this guy just asking me to help him find what he was looking for, and I explained that he needed to either give us a product ID or a model number, he had none and I just advised him to call back when he had the information, to which he replied: \"Why don't you want to help me?! I'm asking you to help me, now come here and help me pick \"x\", stand up so I can report you to your supervisor!\", it dawned on me that this idiot though I was physically at the store and I clearly heard someone paging in the background and then I realized that he was IN the store (dumbass). I told him that I wasn't at the store and to please call back when he had the information, he proceeded to scream at me demanding a supervisor, by this moment, the call was already 5 minutes in and it fucked up my handle time, so I signaled QA and my sup to listen, they just gave me the sign to hang up. So I did. bye Felicia! ....  2 minutes later, my coworker got his call... he still didn't have any info... he still asked him to stand up.\n\n\nI still lol at that to this day.",

        "text": "When I was working bill pay tech support I got a call on our private monthly charged service.\n\nI had this customer complaining about how our system did not send out a payment.  This customers payment history was very difficult to read.  He would cancel payment and reschedule them a couple dozen times each.  Have several pending payments to the same payee scheduled with slight variances because you can not schedule the exact same payment more than once.  So after about 5 minutes of trying to find the payment he is taking about he starts demanding free service to compensate him.  He is being super aggressive about it, I ask to put him on hold so I can deep dive into his account without him purposelessly trying to distract me.  He tell me no, and i put up with his verbal abuse and find that he canceled the payment right before it was to be sent out.  So he starts throwing a tantrum on the phone and I go look at his history of credits.  Now we can give 1 free month per account.  This guy was littered with free credits.  I looked at his bill and he was sitting on over 2 years of free service from previous reps giving into him.  I tell him I am unable to give him any more credit since he was already given free credit a couple time within the last month.  He starts threatening to get me fired saying that he will tell my supervisor I swore at him and stupid things like that.  So I offer to get him my supervisor, and he refuses insisting I still give him free service.  Meanwhile I am messaging my supervisor and he is getting ready to take the call.  So he starts being offensive and I just send him off to my supe.\n\nI looked over his account he had been with us for over 5 years and only paid for 1 month of service with us.  My supe noted the account to never give free service to this guy again.  But if anyone read his notes in the first place would have seen the previous ones anyway.\n\n",

        "text": "Pretty long story, sorry.\n\n**Background**: I work in retirement plans at one of the larger US financial institutions in America. I have a bachelor's degree in psychology and I took what I could get. I've been in this call center for 2 years now. I exclusively work with public sector employees, so a whole lot of cops, firefighters, and government workers. Some of these people are awesome to talk to, others think they are entitled to bypass all IRS guidelines because they're in public safety. It's good and bad, but mostly bad. Mostly soul sucking and drinking heavily on weeknights bad. I'm in a weird position where because of staffing and training issues, I take almost 100% back to back calls while I watch everyone in the cubes around me sit around waiting for the calls they've been trained it. Then when we have our team meetings and one on ones with managers they're praised for having good stats and I'm asked why I'm not working as hard as them even though I'm working twice as hard as them every single day. I somehow \"lost\" seniority at our last shift bid and when from a standard M-F schedule to working 12 hours shifts on Monday, Tuesday, and Friday (our busiest days), and a Saturday shift to hit 40. I really hate to complain, but that's the way it is and has been for about 8 months now. I've been applying both internally and externally to get out with no luck.\n\nSo some of my job is cool. Sometimes I'm making a million dollar mutual fund exchange or solving a complex payroll issue. Most of my job however, is helping people over the age of 55 sign into their retirement accounts on the website. We seem to change our security features every two months or so. Sometimes the password parameters change, sometimes it's extra security questions. There's always something new to confuse the 75 year old retired fire chief who was forced into receiving paperless statements and is pissed about it. \n\nSo I had a call a few weeks ago from a dude in his late 60's. \"I can't get on your stupid website. I can't get past the damn security.\" \n\nThe part that he's stuck on, technically requires me to put the guy on hold and have a manager change something in the guy's account. It was later in the day, and the only manager on duty is pretty much the only manager I actually respect at this place anymore so I don't really want to bother him. So there's a quick fix we're not supposed to do that I do anyway. All the customer has to do is sign out and sign back in again and he's in.\n\n**Balloons:** \"Sir I just reset the system, if you could, log out of your account and log back in. It'll ask you to sign up for that security feature as if you were a new user. You can register your device, and you'll never have to go through that again.\" \n\nCustomer interprets this as logging out of his computer and apparently just hits the power button, and can't figure out how to turn his computer back on. Jesus fucking Christ. He believes this is my fault and he's swearing up and down about our customer service and our website. Says there's another computer in a different room in the house he can try that's still on and thinks he might be able to figure it out on that. \n\nSo I sit there waiting, listening to the shuffling around of the phone and him booting up Internet Explorer with 35 Ask Jeeves toolbars clouding his vision. It took us another 15 fucking minutes, but we got him into his account.\n\nSo this is when the conversation took a very strange turn.\n\n**Customer**: \"Thanks for helping me. Sorry for being such a hard ass. Me and computers just don't get along very well.\" \n\n**Balloons**: \"No problem sir. Thanks for being patient with me, was there anything else I could do for you today?\"\n\n**Customer**: \"Where you from man?\"\n\n**Balloons**: \"I'm sorry?\"\n\n**Customer**: \"Where you located right now? Are you in the States?\"\n\n**Balloons**: \"Oh sorry, I'm in &lt;Insert midsize northeastern city&gt;.\"\n\n**Customer**: \"How is everything there?\"\n\n**Balloons**: \"Oh not too bad, temperature is--\"\n\n**Customer**: \"No I don't give a shit about that man, how are things for you?\"\n\n**Balloons**: \"Sir?\"\n\n**Customer**: \"Is this call recorded?\"\n\n**Balloons**: \"Yes sir.\"\n\n**Customer**: \"Does anyone actually listen to them?\"\n\n**Balloons**: \"Uh, I mean not every call is--\"\n\n**Customer**: \"Good. So here's what I think and maybe it's just a hunch. You don't really want to be on the phones right now.\"\n\nOh fuck is my depression cutting through my customer service voice?\n\n**Customer**: \"I'm gonna guess you're not really where you want to be in life yet. You're probably young, maybe you got a wife, maybe you think things are okay right now. But I got a question for you man, what the fuck do you really want to do?\" \n\nJesus Christ man, is it really that obvious? I was speechless.\n\n**Customer**: \"And maybe you don't know right now, and maybe you think you got all the time in the world, but you gotta figure this shit out man. You gotta make a plan, write this shit down, and fucking stick to it.\" \n\nSo I awkwardly thanked him and got off the phone. Ended up being about a half hour call and went perfectly until the end of my day. Praying that no one actually listens to this call in the future. I went home and laid in bed and thought about everything he said. I thought about my half ass attempts to find a job elsewhere. My carpet bombs of \"one click applies\" on shitty websites that never lead to anything. So that weekend, I got to work. I tore my resume in half. I wrote up a new cover letter. I had friends review it, and rewrote it and rewrote it until I had something I actually liked. Found some great advice on /r/jobs. I cancelled all of my alerts on different job websites and started only going to company websites. Found direct emails so someone could actually hear what I had to say instead of being filtered out by a computer. \n\nFast forward about three weeks, to yesterday. I walked into work and handed my boss my two weeks notice. I have no idea how, but someone actually liked what I had to say and offered to interview me. In two weeks I'll start at a job that makes the exact same money, but involves community outreach and not being stuck in a cubicle all day. So this customer, that I just assumed as being a giant elderly douche, essentially gave me a much needed slap in the face, and changed my life. So I don't know where the rest of you guys are in your lives, but maybe take a little bit of inspiration from this story if you can, and never give up.\n\nTL;DR: Asshole customer ended up motivating me to change my life.\n",

It is explained 4 times about physical damage and the customer must accept the terms and conditions online where it mentions it again. \n\nFirst manager she spoke to offered to reduce it to cost of insurance replacement, essentially cut the charge in half.

I look up that case and notice the screen crack lines up perfectly with the opening of the case. This crack is a STRAIGHT horizontal line with spiderweb cracks underneath it. I explain upon further review this damage could not have been caused during transit and ONLY by extreme pressure or a hard drop while in the case. I refuse any adjustment as it's not warranted.

        "text": "I work for a Major us-based telco as a universal agent. There was a period of time where position-critical tasks were locked out of our profile and we had to deal with other departments to handle certain work orders. The problem is these were often times outsourced. In particular, provisioning and closing work orders with VoIP on them, or setting up services that have a bulk agreement with the residence. The most infamous internally is Bulk residential.\n\n\n\n\n$Me - yours truly.\n$BA - Bulk agent.\n\n\n\n\nThe customer in question was transferring from a retail address to a bulk address. As this was outside of our demarcation I conferenced with the residential bulk department in the customer's area for assistance.\n\n\n\n\n$Me   \"Hello, this is $Me from the Mover's dept.

        "text": "First time poster. I'm currently working for a $MajorTelco in the USA in a position that I will be affectionately referring as a \"Universal Agent.\" I do literally everything. Tier 1, Tier 2, VoIP, Transfers of Service, Disconnects, Special outbound projects, Escalations, Sales, so on and so forth. This was a call related to two things: Email, and disconnect of an account. I'm also going to be 100% on the level and say that I'm not very familiar with posting on Reddit so I can't guarantee the quality of the formatting.\n\n\n\n\nCast for today's tale:\n\n\n\n\n&gt;$Me.\n&gt;$EL - Email lady, the main person I spoke to for most of the call. &gt;Sweet gal, just one of the worst users I've ever spoken with. &gt;Many headdesks and facepalms were had.\n&gt;$Hu - Husband. Helped with making sure EL fully understood what I told her.\n\n\n\n\nTo start, the call was originally to disconnect services. The customer is moving out of the footprint, and is concerned about keeping her ISP-provided email. I explain that we have new policy that allows ex-customers to retain their emails as an \"Email-Only Customer\" at no charge, provided they accessed their account one every 90 days. After processing the disconnect and quoting her the final balance owed, she asked me what I meant by needing to access the account. This is where the problems started.\n\n\n\n\n**$Me** Well in order to keep the account active, you need to access the account at least once every 90 days. If the account is not accessed for 91 or more days, it goes in to an inactive state and you will no longer be able to retrieve your emails. You can access your account by going to $CompanyWebsite, using your $ISPSuppliedEmail and Password. How do you normally access your emails? \n\n\n**EL** I just look at my Emails. Password? I never set up a password!\n\n\n\n\n**Alarms are going off in my head. Help.**\n\n\n\n\n**$Me** Well, in order to access your emails, you would of course need to use your Email and Password. Are you using a third-party mailer, or our own $ISPSupplied Webmail?\n\n\n**$El** Third-party email client? I don't know what you mean.\n\n\n**$Me** Well, what type of device are you using? Desktop? Laptop? Mobile Device? What steps do you take to access your emails?\n\n\n**$EL** I open up my $FruityTablet and my emails are there.\n\n\n**$Me** Okay, so you use $FruityMailer. I understand. So in order to access your emails with that client, you of course would use your $ISPSuppliedEmail and Password. Using the same Email and Password, I would like you to open up $FruityBrowser, and navigate to $ISPCustomerPage and in the upper right-hand corner, tap on where it says \"Log In.\"\n\n\n**$EL** Do you mean google $ISPCustomerPage? I did that and I'm getting $ISPSponsoredAds.\n\n\n**$Me** No, ma'am. At the very top of the browser, you should see the Web URL, such as www.$website$.com. Do you see that? \n\n\n\n\n**$EL** confirms that she does, and navigates to the site. From there, she tries to log in with what I assume to be the wrong password. She's given repeated authentication errors. I then walk her through the password reset steps, and run in to a problem with the customer's security questions. I bypass the CX set-up security questions per $ISP policy, and manually set her password for her. This is where $HU comes in. After another 10 minutes of trying her $FruityTablet and $FruityDesktop she is unable to log in even after my password reset. I go over the same steps with $HU after authenticating him as an authorized user. We're able to confirm the password works.\n\n\n**$HU** So in order for her to keep her emails, she just needs to sign in to her account once every 90 days, correct? Just follow the steps you laid out for me?\n\n\n**$Me** Yes, that's right. All she needs to do is access her account once every 90 days. To make absolutely certain she won't lose her emails, I recommend she access her email via webmail. At that point she can go back to her preferred third-party mail app.\n\n\n$Hu is happy with this, and returns the call to $EL. Shortly after, $EL explodes in to panic.\n\n\n**$EL** MY EMAILS ARE GONE!!! WHAT HAVE YOU DONE, THEY'RE ALL GONE!!! AND THIS IS DIFFERENT. THIS DOESN'T LOOK LIKE WHAT I'M USED TO.. THIS IS AWFUL, PLEASE FIX IT.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter calming her down I'm able to find out she's in the web app and not her preferred third-party mail app. I walk her through navigating back to her mailer, and find out that she has to re-authenticate due to the change of password. She puts $HU back on as she's incoherent and unable to follow instructions. I walk him through changing the saved password and she's back up and running in a matter of minutes. **I'd like to note at this time that I am entirely unfamiliar with the platform and mail app she's using and had been using $PopularOSEmulationSite to figure out WTF I'm doing. The call is also nearing the 90 minute mark. Help me.**\n\n\n\n\nAfter we're able to calm $EL down yet another time, we get her back on the call to finish wrap-up. I get her to write down detailed instructions on how to access the customer portal. She then gets confused on what to do if the customer portal doesn't log her on. We had logged her on and off multiple times during this process to confirm each device was working properly. I then explain that if she's remembered and her browser doesn't log her off, not to worry about it and to just check again in another 90 days. If she's logged on, simply go on about her business. If she's logged off, log back on. Even this explanation goes over her head and she puts $HU back on one final time to notate the process too. It finally boils down to \"Follow the ritual, and only the ritual, and you'll not have any problems.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**TL;DR, User is easily frazzled by even the most basic of steps, even when myself and her husband are explaining in the most direct, layman way possible, wants to keep her ISP-provided email address.**\n",
