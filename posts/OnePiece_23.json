And their power seems to be from some link to a sky weapon rather than personal power.\n\nIf Imu truly was strong, they wouldnt be afraid to go outside and face the world. Imu likely has had the Op Op fruit immortal surgery performed. And they still, after almost a millenium, are not a complete ruler of the world.\n\nIf Blackbeard somehow got the immortal surgery and the sky weapon, he would be able to plunge the world into deeper darkness. Since he actually has personal power, he will be able to actually go out into the world. And since his fruit and network allow him to hunt devil fruits easier than the WG, he can make his guys immortal as well.\n\nSo the basic thing is that Blackbeard and his crew can become Imu and the celestial dragons if they were out and about in the world instead of lounging around in Marie Geoise. \n\nThey would be a bunch of sorcerer kings going around and terrorizing the world.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/11lhinc/pluton_will_be_made_just_not_by_franky/",
        "text": "So I know a popular theory is that Franky memorized the pluton plans before he destroyed them. This theory in my experience breaks into two separate lines of thinking. Either Franky will build a pluton for the final arc or the thousand sunny is a pluton or modified pluton. \n\nI don't like this theory for a couple of reasons that I will get into here. \n\nFirst, this theory feels like low hanging fruit and oda always gives us what we want in a way we don't expect. It's too easy to see coming. \n\nSecond this really doesn't do anything for Franky as a character. Franky makes new ships from his new designs he doesn't follow someone's plans he makes the plans always has. Making an old plan doesn't fit here. Also when the new pluton is made it has to be  destroyed in the final arc. Think about the two cases here: case 1 it is allied with the straw hats. For naritive tension and so that the straw hats including the sunny stay the heros it will be destroyed by there enemies maybe even original pluton. Or case 2 it is against the straw hats then it makes a lot of sense for Franky to destroy it using the sunny making him the best ship builder ever.\n\nThird building a ship takes time. Oda can be fast and loose with time requirements at points however he does take these things into consideration. Heck the conclusion to one of the best arcs was \"we need more time to train\". If Franky can build this ship in a week or a whatever why hasn't he done it already? Why not build it to fight kiado or to infletrate whole cake island? It would feel super hollow at the end of the story for Franky to pull an ancient weapon out of his back pocket.\n\nFinally it ruins his bet on the straw hats. In envies lobby when Franky burns the plans he bets not only that the straw hats will save Robin but that they will stop pluton if it falls into the wrong hands. Also if Franky memorized the blueprints, the world government could extract it from him eventually. This was an all in all on the table moment for him. If he still has the plans he really didn't bet anything. \n\n\nSo if not Franky then who? Well there is really only one other candidate, Icepops! \n\nWhy Iceberg? Let's explore his resume to see.\n\nHe had the plans for years before handing them off to Franky. He easily could have memorized the plans in this time. He also has the skill and resources to build the plans. \n\nMoreover we know that the plans are insane. Franky questions if it is possible to build it when iceberg hands him the plans at first. We leave water seven with iceberg trying to do the seemingly impossible of turning an island into a fully functional ship. My bet is that this is pluton that he is trying to build he will have had years to work on it at this point solving the time issue. \n\nThe water seven arc is about family and choices. Franky is abandoned as a child which is tragic. He then finds Tom who chooses to take him in. Franky, Tom and iceberg all make ships together which Tom teaches the two kids to be proud of and to love and own no matter what just like how Tom loves them no matter what. At the end of the flash back Franky disown his ships which send Tom as he has to own and love his ships and the choice to build them even if it didn't work out in the end. Luffy on the other hand has to make tough choices of what to do about Robin betraying them, what to do about the going merry and usopp leaving the crew. All these choices are hard because they are all family so how much does family count  and for robin and the going merry are they family? Robin has to choose what she wants in life and has to choose who to trust herself or her family. Franky makes a huge choice to burn the plans fight the government and become a pirate. Iceberg at the start of the arc refuses to make choices. He is under attack for the plans and chooses to do nothing. He eventually passes the responsibility of making a choice to Franky. His island is sinking and he sits and watches it happen. At the end of the arc iceberg Finally starts to act he makes a choice to try to save the island even though he is not sure it's possible. If this is pluton the he has made a choice to bet it all on the straw hats like Franky. He is actively choosing the future that the straw hats are building rather then being a passive player allowing others to choose the future. \n\n\nThis also builds helps finalize frankys arc. Let look at what happens if iceberg builds pluton. Ice Pluton comes and is allied with the straw hats for the final arc. Either it gets stolen and the straw hats have to destroy it or it gets destroyed and the straw hats have to beat whatever super weapon brought it down. Either way having Franky use the sunny to destroy either pluton or the pluton killing weapon would prove he is the best ship builder ever. \n\nThank you for coming to my Ted talk. \n\n\nTldr: iceberg builds pluton",

And now, he now even got the info about his family and ancestors, who are frankly very important to Wano and Zoro, since he comes from a family of legendary swordspeople and leaders of Wano, and Kuina being his relative, but it got revealed outside of the story...\n\nI don't know how to feel about this, honestly... I'm incredibly polarized, by being happy that we now know all of that info, but also being disappointed how Oda seems to care little about Zoro, at least him outside of fighting, which for the most part hasn't been that great in Time Skip (beacuse of enemies much weaker than him), excluding Wano.",

        "text": "Actually every admirals are gonna lose against yonko/Yonko crews. All.\n\nHere's why :\n\nChapter 957 : \n\n - Fujitora vs Blackbeard. \n\nBlackbeard bounty is 2 247 600 000 berries. \nHe wants something he doesn't want to leave to the navy. \n\nChapter 1059 : \n\nHis bounty is 3 996 000 000 berries. More than 1,7 billion higher than his previous bounty. \n\nWHY? \n\nBecause he wasn't referring to the mero mero no mi. He crossed the calm belt, got what he wanted, and earned a huge bounty increase. \n\nBut Fujitora was also on calm belt. My bet is that Blackbeard defeated Fujitora and that Aokiji is FINALLY a member of his crew (his clothes changed, maybe that's an hint). \n\nSo Blackbeard vs Fujitora : Winner : Blackbeard. \n\n\n- Kizaru and Saturn VS Strawhats and cp0. \n\nMaybe the cp0 will turn against Saturn which would be interesting. As for Kizaru, he'll face Luffy and naturally lose. \n\n\n- Ryokugyu vs Mihawk. \n\nRyokugyu currently has Weevil prisoner on his ship. He has to cross calm belt to get to Impel down. \n\nTwo scenarios :\n\nThe first is that Mihawk attacks him while Ryokugyu and his crew are searching for food (or something else) \n\nThe other one is Impel Down 2.0 : Marco makes an alliance with the Cross guild and they go to Impel down. Obviously, an admiral will be here with Magellan, but that's not a problem. \n\nHints : Ryokugyu looks like he has a black blade with him, it may bode well. \n\n\n- Shanks vs Akainu : \n\nAkainu loses his temper. He has literally just learned that Law and Teach are fighting at Winner Island, that the mugis are at egghead, and that the cross guild is hunting the marines. When he'll learn that Kid and Shanks are clashing, he'll decide to leave his office. \n\n\nConclusion :\n\nNot all admirals will die. I think Fujitora is alive, Kizaru will also make it, and Ryokugyu will definitely lose his life. But it'll mark a big split between the world government and the navy. \n\nThat said, is it serious ? \n\nNot totally. Imu is actually ruling the world and she's probably not a weak person. The gorosei and Kong are also powerful fighters (probably). \nThey have extremely powerful technological weapons. \n\nAnd finally : the Seraphim. \nThe purpose of the seraphim is to protect God's throne (here we are talking about the \"empty\" throne). \n\nThey're already Yonko commander level and they're just children. Which means that at their prime, they'll certainly possess extremely high levels. \nThey're most likely 8 or 9. Maybe 10.\n\n So don't worry for the world government, even if they lose 4 admirals, they'll always be able to control the world. The only difference is that Imu will have to come to light.",

Any reference to Japanese words will be written in English as best I can because I don't know how to write any of this in Japanese.\n\nSo I just finished the Summit War and noticed a bit of a discrepancy in the subtitles versus what I am hearing as someone who does not speak Japanese. Whenever Luffy is referred to as \"Straw Hat\" they always say something along the lines of \"Mugiwara\" (I don't know how to spell things in Japanese). Whenever Bon Clay talks to Luffy, he calls him \"Mugi-chan\", which the subtitles translate as \"Straw-chan\". Seems to check out to me, a non-Japanese speaker. However, whenever Ivan is talking to Luffy, he calls him \"Mugiwara-boy\", which get subtitled as \"Straw-boy\". Once again, I know almost nothing about Japanese as a language, but wouldn't it be more like \"Straw Hat-boy\"? I understand that direct translations rarely are perfect, and translating anything involves a bit of interpretation, but that seems a little inconsistent to me. Anyone able to enlighten me?\n\nI absolutely love the show nonetheless and will continue watching through to the end.",

This seems the only logical theory till yet.\nHowever, I believe none of the vegapunks are thr traitors, nor the gorosei has issued to order\nIt was CATARINA DEVON, who had somewhat snuck into the island, and impersonated the real vegapunk while Bonney had turned him into a child. We all know blackbeard is making strides everywhere, sending his generals to various places( for eg kidnapping pudding). Catarina was sent b here to kidnap VP for his own use (which I don't know what are his intentions). Using her devil fruit, which has the same Function as BonClay's fruit, she turned into VP and gave the Seraphim the order\n\nThis is all a hunch, and I might be wrong, but this seems like the most plausible idea. \n\nTLDR; Catarina Devon is the traitor, who impersonated VP and ordered the seraphim to fight",

        "text": "We are inclined to believe that black blades are the result of infusing your weapon with Haki alot of times because haki is often displayed as black and even infusing the weapon with haki turns the weapon black, but i don't think thats it, or alteast not just that, first because there are alot of top tiers that uses swords, for example Whitebeard used the same blade for many decades, he was incredible strong and he had both conquerors and armament, yet his blade never turned black, same is true for other top tiers such as Roger or Shanks , all these guys uses swords and none of them have a black one, and even if you wanna be picky and say they are not exactly swordsmen then i give you Oden, a swordsman who used the same 2 swords for his entire life, also super strong, also had conquerors and yet his blades never turned to the dark side of the force.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, if its not just haki then what ? i believe that for a blade to turn black it has to kill, but when i say 'kill' i don't mean kill a person but another sword, and not any sword; a renowned sword, first because they are rare, a honored swordsman would avoid destroying them even if it belongs to a enemy, second because they are more resistant, for example when Mihawk broke Zoro's swords Kuina's blade didn't break, so even on the hands of a weak user( Zoro back then ) a renowned blade is still hard to break, and lastly because these swords can somehow hold haki, we saw Kaido feeling Oden's haki in Enma, while i'm not saying the swords are alive like a person they do have something special to it, if they seem to be \"alive\" then they can be \"killed\", perhaps Mihawk got his black blade that way, perhaps in one his many duels around the world he destroyed a meito in combat, afterall he seems to have no problem in ruining blades as he broke Zoro's blades with no chill, that would also explain why other top tiers don't have black blades, both because they weren't dueling other people all the time and because maybe they didn't had enough experience with blades to able to break a meito in combat, perhaps you gotta be a legend like Mihawk to even be able to break one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Black swords are forged when they destroy( \"kill\" ) a meito in combat which is a insanely hard feat and hence why we don't see many black swords around, just infusing your sword with haki will not turn it black otherwise we would see more of them since most top tiers uses swords to fight.",

This would be pretty funny so he might have laughed and would also make him too early because Rouge is the current user so she would need to die for him to get a chance at the fruit.\nIf there are there any holes in this theory let me know",

How fast after applying sea stone will a DF user loose all his strength? \n\n2. Can coating yourself in haki prevent sea stone from directly touching your skin? Or would sea stone bypass armament coating?\n\nIf sea stone takes out relative top tiers like Lucci so quickly, why are more people not using it? \n\nAnd before anyone says ‚Äúbecause it‚Äôs rare/hard to make‚Äù, realize that the bottom of marine ships are covered in sea stone, so contributing a small amount to top fighters, like stussy has with her lipstick, would be a huge power boost in order to take out relatively strong DF users.",
