For example, plausibly, if you haven’t been dating someone for more than a week, you owe less to someone than you would provided that you two were married.\n3.\tWhat makes a given romantic relationship good?

The same is true of common examples we give like \"square circles\". Actually, it doesn't take a lot of imagination to think of a world where an object may appear as a circle and as a square to two different groups of people, who eventually come together and agree to call it a square circle but l digress.

I am not very well read on both, my teacher said it was a good topic, so I am trying to read more about it. \n\nHowever, I am a little stuck on why Merleau-Ponty rejects music as a form of art to experience this embodied Being/Transcedental subjectivity.

And while I'm no expert on Spinoza, he as well sounds like he sees God as being central in both metaphysics as well as matters of ethics.\n\nThe reason why I think it might have to do with his voluntarism is that it means that whatever God does is good by definition. And reducing that to a triviality means there's not much to do with regards to justifying God's decision making or his relationship to creation.\n\nOr it might just be that Descartes isn't a very theological thinker, so he didn't have much to say on these matters. What do you say?",

        "text": "Greetings \n\nMods, please take this down if it’s it goes against this subs rules (I read them and they were a bit vague so I don’t really know if it goes against the rules)\n\nAfter studying about things like dentology, consequentialism and other general ethical theories, I can’t seem to find any that my moral framework aligns with.\n\nI am a subjectivist and hold the belief that both deontology and consequentialism matter.\n\nI believe that if an act someone commits goes against my moral axioms, it’s an immoral action (to me).\n\nI don’t think it makes them necessarily immoral though.\n\nIf someone genuinely believes that doing an act that I regard as immoral will yield results that will increase well being or be good in general, they aren’t immoral in my eyes.\n\nSame goes for psychopaths. It’s not their fault they don’t see anything wrong with what they’re doing. Their intentions aren’t necessarily immoral. They don’t believe they’re doing something wrong.\n\nEven if someone genocides a race and genuinely believes it’s for the greater good, they aren’t immoral in my eyes.\n\nTheir actions still are and they should be locked in jail, not for doing something they consider immoral, but for doing something society considers immoral and to stop them from it.\n\nAn individual isn’t immoral in my eyes just because the consequences of their actions are immoral, but rather their intentions.\n\nI believe for example that if a Hunter kills unnecessarily an animal or if a sociopath kills another human, they aren’t immoral even if I consider their actions immoral. It’s not their fault that their external environment was such that it mould their axioms as so they don’t find those actions wrong. \n\nIn a way, I am privileged to have my axiomatic framework shaped the way it is now, and It’s not my fault others have not had a similar privilege due to eg bad parents.\n\nSo to summarise, immoral actions are formed from consequence and immoral individuals are formed from evil intentions (the individual understanding that what they are doing is by their axiomatic definition, wrong)\n\nCan my ethical framework be labelled as threshold deontology ? Maybe something along the ideas and beliefs of Hegel ?",

The plan for him is that he will be able to give my characters some wisdom hes gleaned from mother nature over the years.  \n\n\nIve been doing a bunch of googling to get lines of thought going, and seems to be coming up a little dry. Im finding lots of info about ethics and morals of humans as predators, and humans as hunters. But I want to focus more on when its nature vs nature.  \n\n\nWhen a coyote catches and kills a mother rabbit. You can imagine its not a nice death for her. And then her offspring die from starvation. I wonder about this scenario. Was her life meant simply to provide nourishment for something higher up the food chain. Her offspring dying off starvation is simply collateral damage? What if she escapes the coyote today and again tomorrow and again next year. If her purpose in life was to provide nourishment to a predator higher up the food chain..... but instead, she dies of old age 'happy' in her burrow, does that mean she failed in life?  Why would nature thrive on death and misery? Why didnt mother nature make us all herbivores? Instead it just seems a little cruel that for the coyote to prosper it can only happen at the violent death of thousands of rabbits. What does it mean to be a predator? What does it mean to be born as an item of prey?  \nThose are just some of the questions I'm initially pondering.... but I'm sure there are 100 more angles on this that I havent even considered.  \n\n\nIm not looking for specific answers to those exact questions (but if you do have the answers feel free to tackle them), but more so, I'm just trying to get a broader understanding of the topic. I would love to get some general opinions and thoughts and conversations going. Or if you could point me towards any leads I can follow up on that would be great too!  \n\n\nBTW. I feel like I should state, incase its not obvious. Im not a philosopher in the least. I do enjoy binging Alain de Botton/School of Life so thats my current exposure level :)",

Hence the title.\n\nOn the one hand, the paper is written in the usual, serious style of academic philosophy. Advantages of his view are laid out, potential objections are brought up and answered, the view is put into relation with several other topics, etc. And the author is a professor of philosophy.\n\nBut I also can't shake the feeling that the paper is somewhat tongue in cheek or meant to be provocative or something like that. There's the funny title, the fact that the considered views of utilitarianism and deontology seem to be very simplified if not strawmanned, the obvious fact that such a view could hardly be implemented in almost all real-life scenarios, and just the whole spirit of the paper seems a bit \"Oh you're saying .......? Then I'm sure you have nothing against it if we treat you like ........ . Which all sounds a bit like reddit debates, more than ethics in philosophy.\n\nI'm just wondering, to what degree are some papers or this paper in particular written tongue in cheek? Is there some benefit in laying out such a view, even if the author does not 100% mean it or if it couldn't really be implemented anyway? Any thoughts are welcome.",

Or is this essentially what the Absurd already is and a single use of it just dominates the discussion?\n\nFor example: were we to apply this to “Man can do as he wills, but he cannot will what he wills” we might say ‘man can do as he wills’ to be the Representation as perception and expectation free will and ‘cannot will what he wills’ as the determined calculus of Will, than the Absurd may sit between the two as the existential experience of tension from this disunity or incongruence. Even vaguely calling to Schopenhauer’s definition of the ludicrous and the similarity of that to absurd.\n\nI feel like this fits so readily that it seems this is naturally the further extent of the Absurd. But when trying to research all discussion of the Absurd is focused on meaning and looking up connections and overlap between the two search results are nearly inundated with articles about reflections on suicide.\n\nIs this effectively what the Absurd already is? If not, has a connection between these two been discussed previously to your knowledge? And if not, are there any inherent conflicts that either need to be ironed out, updated, or simply makes this incompatible?",

        "text": "**TL;DR What must a philosopher do when they must answer a question where they disagree with a premise of the question?**\n\nI am a university student, studying Philsophy, returning after a year off (due to medical reasons). As part of the requirements that must be met for my return to studies, I need to complete 5 philosophy essays. One of my essays is a practical ethics essay, specifically regarding medical ethics and consent and the question I need to respond to is posing a problem. Namely, that a key assumption of the question in my mind is false and in turn makes the question being asked kind of insignificant. Please see the question below:\n\n **Some medical procedures are permissible even if the subject does not consent. Some are impermissible even if the subject consents. So what is the significance of consent?**\n\nI take issue with the second sentence of the question that some medical procedures are impermissible even if the subject consents. It seems to me that the assumption that some procedures may be impermissible to perform even if the patient consents is for cases in which the patient is consenting to a procedure that in medical terms is unnecessary, dangerous, harmful or overly-risky. An example given by my peer is an instance in which a patient is adamant that they want their right arm to be cut off, because they are a member of a cult that believes that in order to go to heaven you must cut off your dominant arm. My peer stated that in this case it would be impermissible for the doctor to cut off the arm, however I do believe that if the patient has truly been able to give informed, free and capcacitated consent that it *is* permissible for the doctor to perform the surgery; with the allowance being given that the doctor is equally permitted to refuse to perform the procedure. Additionally with this example I would like to state that the case to be made for the procedure to be impermissible is actually reliant on the legitimacy of the consent, given that the consent could have been argued to be provided under misinformation obtained by the patient, and therefore the consent was uninformed and therefore illegitimate. \n\nSince I do not believe that there is any instance in which consent can be legitimately given and the medical procedure would be impermissible, it has become difficult to answer the question in any interesting way other than saying the significance of consent is that it permits doctors to perform medical procedures that violates the rights of patients, as the patient has legitimately forgone their right with their own desires in mind. \n\nI am stuck because I feel like I need to address this significant part of the question but I am in a position where I just flat out disagree with the assumption posed.",

It seems to me that even if we aren't responsible for our actions, we can still have standards for our behaviour. For example, if a young child steals another child's toy, I would recognise on some level that they aren't responsible in the basic desert sense. They're 3, their brain is massively underdeveloped. However, I would still hold them to the standard of not stealing. The fact that the child isn't responsible, doesn't seem to threaten the idea that the child ought not steal. Any thoughts?",

I need to write 2 more pages by tomorrow and mainly need to elaborate on Hegelian model and how this could apply. Problem is, I only have a rudimentary understanding at best. From what I could gather, when examining a problem you have to drop the contradictory idea and look at the ideas that work together (thesis, antithesis, synthesis). Not sure if that’s even quite right, so that’s why I’m employing the help of you all :) anything helps and thanks for your time !!",

Is this belief based on intuition?\n\nSuppose now that I'm studying the similarity relation. I realize that an object A can be similar to object B depending on context. There seems to be different ways to define similarity, and even when one way is picked, such as measuring how many properties are shared between object, it begs the question of which properties to look at and how many there are or could be known.\n\nYet, intuitively, when I see a water bottle, I will think of it as immediately more similar to a cup than say a pillow. This is because there are certain properties between the cup and bottle that seem more intuitively obvious/important that are shared between them than there are between a cup and a pillow. And yet, this kind of intuition seems interally to differ from the intuition that tells me reality might be real. Since the very notion of similariy seems subjective.\n\nAre these different or the same kinds of intuition? Is one more valid than the other?",

(this is the only argument I think would work well as a counterpoint in the paper so far)\n\nUtilitarian Argument #2\n\n\\- If the patient has taken appropriate action to submit a DNR, then the doctor's failure to uphold the DNR does not provide a utilitarian outcome. (It will not provide hapiness) (This argument feels sloppy to me but i can see it working)\n\nArgument against Good Samaritan Law\n\n\\- The doctor is not a bystander, but a medical professional, therefore they are not ethically protected by the good Samaritan law. (I personally think this argument sucks and wouldn't work well for the paper) I feel it would be too easy to counterpoint since one's profession doesn't make their actions any more/less ethical.\n\nWhat are your opinions on these arguments/ is there any other potential arguments I am missing that you believe works well for the goal of the assignment?",

These were read sporadically so my understanding is quote restricted. Additionally, I read \"Animals, Anomalies, and Inorganic Others\" by Rosi Braidotti. From what I can tell, both Braidotti and the personalists criticize the emphasized confidence in human reason promoted throughout the enlightenment. Braidotti says this outrightly, and I know that Scheller dedicated a book to a criticism of Immanuel Kant's system. In this way, Braidotti's neo-Spinozism and personalism (I am speaking perhaps overly broad on personalism here) both are antihumanist. On the other hand, personalists hold the person/the individual as the highest value and have a reputation for contributing to concepts of human rights and actively participating in human rights activism. Personalism in this sense seems that it could be described as humanist.\n\nNow, when I first read Braidotti's piece, I didn't realize that antihumanism was a broad label of different philosophical schools. I wrote a literature analysis criticizing her approach to ecology for being depersonalizing. I knew when I wrote my criticism that human and person are not synonymous, but I felt that my criticism still was well supported. As I am becoming more learned in personalism, posthumanism, and antihumanism, I am beginning to wonder if I was deeply wrong. Perhaps, personalism is a posthumanism or antihumanism, and my understanding was extremely flawed.\n\nHow would you describe the relations of antihumanism and humanism (and posthumanism if you care to tackle it) to personalism?",

Usually I can at least come up with something but I feel so lost.\n\nIt could be something obscure or something small. If anyone has any ideas, I would very much appreciate it! It doesn't have to be substantial, even just a starting place for thought. Thank you!",

Not only I'm having difficulty finding a good outline of educational theories in philosophy (apart from the stanford encyclopedia), but arts specifically is a subject often ignored. I believe philosophy of education is the field that better could answer this question.\n\nFor me it would be best recommendations of papers than whole books, or more concise information, but I'm open to any suggestion on bibliography or authors. Also, if any one would be kind enough to provide me an outline of the arguments generally used I'd be thankful.\n\n(For context, I've read the entry on philosophy of education in the plato edu encyclopedia, but found little that helped.)",

By Wikipedia definition it is the position that ethical sentences express propositions that refer to objective features of the world. I understand that this means there is real right and wrong in the world independent of time, culture and even human existence. Is this a good definition or moral realism, or do we need some checkmarks, such as that humans need to exist in order for moral truths to exist? We know that humans, language and the language concepts of right and wrong haven't existed for all of the history of the universe. Did the moral \"real\" came to be or was it somewhere waiting to get discovered all along? If it came to be with people, its contingent. How much conditions can we allow before we are relativist, and is relativism even a meaningful opposite to moral realism?",
