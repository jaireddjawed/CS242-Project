        "text": "It‚Äôs been a [tough year](https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/24/business/food-inflation-habits/index.html) for US consumers**,** who battled decades-high inflation for the majority of the year and even saw gas prices [hit $5 in June](https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/11/business/gas-prices-five-dollars-national-june/index.html).\n\nThe latest inflation data, not adjusted for seasonal swings, shows [price hikes have now slowed to 7.1%](https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/13/economy/cpi-inflation-report-november/index.html) for the year through November, after [hitting a pandemic-era peak of 9.1% in June,](https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/13/economy/cpi-inflation-june/index.html) according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nFrom November 1 to December 24, shoppers still had to dig deep for gifts, with [retail sales jumping](https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/26/economy/us-consumers-holiday-spending/index.html) 7.6%, unadjusted for inflation, compared to the same period last year, according to the Mastercard Spending Pulse, which tracks retail sales, excluding automotive sales. Holiday meals were also [more expensive](https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2022/11/business/thanksgiving-dinner-inflation/), and [food prices outpaced inflation](https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/13/business/grocery-prices/index.html) throughout the year.\n\nBut while some items saw massive double-digit increases in 2022, others were a deal. Here‚Äôs how prices changed this year.\n\n## Electronics and major appliances dropped\n\nüì∑Demand for big-ticket electronics fell this year.Dan Kitwood/Getty Images\n\nConsumer demand for big-ticket electronics has fallen recently, leading stores to discount.\n\nIn the year through November, several major electronics got cheaper: Smartphone prices plunged 23.4%, TV prices dropped 17% and computers got 4.4% less expensive.\n\nAd Feedback\n\nThe price of major appliances fell 1%.\n\nEarlier in the year, [chains like Best Buy and Walmart](https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/01/business/walmart-best-buy-gap-promotions/index.html) stocked up on merchandise, preparing for supply chain shortages and what they projected to be robust consumer demand. But their plans were derailed by inflation and slumping consumer confidence.\n\nPlus, many consumers had already made large purchases or upgrades while stuck at home early in the pandemic.\n\n## Toys and apparel grew modestly\n\nüì∑Overall inflation outpaced the increase in apparel and other items.Stefani Reynolds/AFP/Getty Images\n\nApparel prices rose, but slowly. Clothing increased 3.6%, while footwear rose 2.3%. Sporting goods increased 2.7% and toys 0.6%.\n\nThe increases made these items a relative bargain, as they were all outpaced by overall inflation.\n\n‚ÄúIn toys, sporting goods, apparel, categories like that, prices have come down more aggressively,‚Äù Walmart CEO [Doug McMillon said in an interview on CNBC](https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/06/business/walmart-prices-doug-mcmillion-ceo/index.html) in December. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre still inflated but we‚Äôre not inflated nearly as much as we are in the other categories.‚Äù\n\nHere, again, many retailers misjudged consumer demand and so had excess inventory pile up. To clear out merchandise and entice shoppers to buy,[ stores ramped up promotions](https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/30/business/nike-stock-discounts/index.html). This kept prices in check.\n\n## Plane tickets and gas got more expensive\n\nüì∑Airfare prices spiked as demand roared back.Bruce Bennett/Getty Images\n\nThis year, [demand for air travel roared back](https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/15/business/rising-airfares-fuel-prices/index.html) after [falling to an all-time low in 2020](https://www.bts.gov/newsroom/average-air-fares-dropped-all-time-low-2020). Plane ticket prices jumped 36% annually in the year through November.\n\nIn March, Delta president Glen Hauenstein [called the spike](https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/15/business/rising-airfares-fuel-prices/index.html) in demand ‚Äúunprecedented,‚Äù adding ‚ÄúI have never seen ‚Ä¶ demand turn on so quickly as it has after Omicron,‚Äù the Covid-19 variant that caused cases to spike last winter.\n\nMany airlines [reported record revenue](https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/04/business/airlines-gain-passengers-pain/index.html) in April, May and June thanks to high airfares and full planes as travelers returned in full force two years into the pandemic.\n\nOn the ground, travel got more expensive, as well. Gasoline prices were up 10.1% for the year, but are now [off their record highs](https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/01/energy/gas-prices-inflation/index.html). Volatility in gas prices was largely due to Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine and [geopolitical maneuvers that used oil supply](https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/10/politics/opec-oil-biden-what-matters/index.html) as a tool.\n\nStill, the national average could still climb back above the $4-a-gallon threshold as soon as May, according to GasBuddy projections[ shared with CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/27/economy/gas-prices-inflation-2023-outlook/index.html).\n\nGasBuddy, an app that tracks fuel prices, doesn‚Äôt anticipate another year of extreme volatility, however.\n\n## Food prices soared\n\nüì∑Food inflation was higher than overall inflation in the year through November.Elijah Nouvelage/AFP/Getty Images\n\nIn the year through November, [food got 10.6% more expensive](https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/13/business/grocery-prices/index.html), outpacing overall inflation.\n\nIn that period, several individual grocery items got even pricier for a variety of reasons.\n\n[Egg prices shot up](https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/27/business/egg-prices/index.html) a massive 49.1%, due to a supply shortage caused by a deadly avian flu, coupled with high demand.\n\nMargarine got 47.4% pricier because of price swings in the vegetable oil market caused largely by the [war in Ukraine](https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/02/business/palm-oil-prices-ukraine/index.html), while butter got 27% more expensive after a contraction in the global milk supply.\n\nAnother staple, flour, got 24.9% more expensive due to the war in Ukraine‚Äôs [impact on the global grain market](https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/02/europe/russia-resumes-ukraine-grain-deal-intl/index.html) and high transportation costs in the United States. [Even lettuce saw a 19.8% increase](https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/16/business/olive-garden-lettuce/index.html), due to crop disease in California.\n\nOverall, grocery prices jumped 12% in the period, with many consumers accepting the higher prices as thriftier [alternatives to restaurant meals](https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/15/business/restaurant-sales-traffic/index.html), which also grew more expensive, though at a slower clip. Food away from home became 8.5% more expensive in 2022, with many restaurants hiking up menu prices in order to mitigate their own higher input costs.",

        "text": "Hello Reddit! This is Matthew Rodier, a photojournalist that is based in New York, who spent 103 days documenting the Hong Kong protests of 2019.\n\nA lot has happened since my last AMA, in Hong Kong, in America, and in my life. Hong Kong has instituted its National Security Law, which has led to the arrests of over 200 individuals, a mass exodus of Hong Kongers overseas (particularly to the UK) and essentially the criminalization of public criticism of the Hong Kong government. I have been working in the U.S. since the last AMA. Some of the stories I have covered since then have been: the reaction to the sentencing of Ahmaud Arbery's killers in Georgia, a far right political rally in Portland and subsequent street violence between the participants and counterprotesters, a large crowd gathered in the streets of D.C. to celebrate Joe Biden's victory, the storming of the United States Capitol on January 6th, 2021, and a series of climate change protests in Manhattan earlier this year. \n\nI also moved back to NY from DC and took a break from work to deal with a family health issue, but I am excited to do some more coverage abroad in the coming year.\n\nTwo weeks ago I released the hardcover version of my photography book on the Hong Kong protests of 2019, When I Go Dreaming. Those of you interested in purchasing it can find it here: [https://www.blurb.com/b/11417395-when-i-go-dreaming](https://www.blurb.com/b/11417395-when-i-go-dreaming)\n\nSo let's get to it, AMA! I will be answering questions for most of today with a few breaks in between.\n\nProof: [https://imgur.com/a/eETOLkg](https://imgur.com/a/eETOLkg). Also, this is my Mastodon account: [https://journa.host/@matthewrodier](https://journa.host/@matthewrodier)",
