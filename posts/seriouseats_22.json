If I do a low roast, because I'm cooking a small piece, will I have trouble getting a large amount of medium rare? Under these circumstances, would I be better off with the sous-vide method? Sous-vide is also more convenient for me as I'm a student and can leave the rib in the bath while I goto class, but I can make it work if I'm going to be sacrificing a ton of flavor. I'm most concerned about having a piece that is too well done.\n\nEdit: Also, would using an electric carving saw ruin the texture of prime rib? Should I only be using a regular knife?",

I've learned some really useful things from these recipes!  Like a microwave is as good as or maybe better for toasting dried chilies and spices than hot pan.  \n\nIn the pressure cooker texas chili recipe you have to toast, hydrate and then blend a bunch of dried chilies.  Kenji didn't just say dump it in a blender - he told me to put a towel over the blender just in case it bursts out.  Sure enough - I didn't have the little clear center insert in right on my lid and had I not read that tip, I'd have had hot chili sauce everywhere.  \n\nThis happens all through the recipes.  I really appreciate it.  \n\nhttp://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2015/01/pressure-cooker-chile-con-carne-texas-red-chili-recipe.html",

Our most cost effective way of raising money is through cooking lunch and selling it in the building. We have a kitchen with a good range and a double ovens so we can cook at the office.\n\nThis is my first year found the fundraisers and in the past the people handling got lazy with the food. It was all slop like casseroles and crappy spaghetti. It's my first year on the team and take too much pride in my cooking to serve shitty and boring food. Plus good food raises more money. \n\nWe are doing \"street tacos\" in a few weeks and I'm trying to plan out the best way of preparing the food. We are doing carnitas and chicken options since they are the most cost effective. I'm not too worried about the carnitas but I'm concerned with the chicken.\n\nI plan on using chicken thighs with a simple marinade to keep things juicy. We are serving about 60 people.\n\nShould I grill the chicken the night before and warm it the day of? Or should I cook it day of? I have a sous vide circulator so I could keep the thighs at temp and sear on a cast iron before lunch. Could I use the sous vide to warm the previously grilled chicken?\n\nI appreciate any advice/tips/suggestions.",

I saw Kenji suggested increasing the measurements by 44%. \n\nAlso... I was wondering if anyone has ever used the original recipe for their 12‚Äù skillet and tried to make the crust a little thinner, or if that would end up a disaster.\n\nThanks for the feedback. \n\n",

I use fish sauce in stews and sauces pretty frequently, but have always added it near the beginning of the cooking time, in part because I'm afraid that the \"fishy\" taste won't cook out if I add it at the end. However, I've noticed that in several of Kenji's recipes, including the one I'm making tonight, he adds it near the end. I'm wondering why that is.

        "text": "Stella's bagel recipe is great, but it really needs to be done over 1.5 days to fully develop the dough. Fresh bagels are decidedly a Sunday morning thing, but I find that if I try to make them on Friday night (per Stella's recipe), its tough to find the time, whereas if its a Saturday afternoon activity, it becomes something fun to do with my toddler. \n\nI've found that with a 1 hour rise at room temp on the first day before shaping per the Epicurious / Peter Reinhart bagel recipe makes up the time difference. At our house, we also like a 6oz rather than 4 oz bagel and have subbed in 10g of honey in place of the 15g of sugar that Stella calls for.\n\n\nUpdated Stella Parks Bagel Recipe\n\nhttp://www.seriouseats.com/2017/01/how-to-make-bravetart-bagels.html\n\n\nFor the Yukone:\n\n* 6 ounces cold water (3/4 cup; 170g)\n* 3 1/2 ounces bread flour (about 3/4 cup, spooned; 100g) \n\nFor the Dough:\n\n* 12 1/2 ounces bread flour (about 2 3/4 cups, spooned; 355g)\n* 10 g honey\n* 2 1/2 teaspoons (9g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt, use half as much by volume or use the same weight\n* 1 teaspoon instant dry yeast (4g)\n* 3 1/2 ounces lukewarm water (1/2 cup minus 1 tablespoon; 100g)\n\n\nYukone\n\n* Turn on the light in the toaster oven\n* In a 10-inch skillet, whisk water and flour over medium heat until the paste is a thick lump, about 2 minutes. \n* Scrape onto a plate, spread into a 1-inch layer, cover and cool until to about 75¬∞F (23¬∞C), around 30 minutes.\n\nDough\n\n* Mix honey, yeast, salt, and water. Add to flour and mix on low for 3 minutes.\n* Wait 5 minutes.\n* Mix on low speed for another 3 minutes\n* Lightly oil, cover, and let rise for 1 hour in the toaster oven with the light on.\n\nShaping\n\n* Shape into 6 oz balls. Shape each ball into a bagel by flattening and punching a hole through the center and then working the ring into the proper shape. Let rest in the fridge overnight. \n\nBoiling and baking.\n\n* Next day, preheat oven to 425\n* Boil for 30 seconds per side in plain water.\n* Bake for 25 minutes. Rest for at least 15 minutes before eating.  \n",

        "text": "Just a quick story I want to share that starts with plagiarism and copyright violation and ends with $30,000 donated to help fight hunger in America.\n\nA few weeks ago, a Twitter user brought to my attention that a book sold on Amazon, The Essential Sous Vide Cookbook, contained recipes that were copied directly from articles I'd written for Serious Eats. As it turns out, I wasn't the only one ripped off. The book also contained recipes and directly copied passages from [Meathead](http://www.AmazingRibs.com), [Chefsteps](http://www.chefsteps.com), and [Andrew Zimmern](http://andrewzimmern.com/). It had been sold on Amazon for about a year and was the number one book on Sous Vide cooking at the time.\n\nI contacted the publisher, Callisto Media, to let them know about this problem. They seemed as surprised as we were about it, claiming that they use software to vet books for plagiarism or copyright violations, but this one had somehow slipped through. In the interest of resolving this as amicably as possible, I suggested that they simply pull the book from Amazon and that they donate 100% of the profits they'd earned on the book thus far to a charity of our choice.\n\nThankfully, they agreed.\n\nThe publishers were 100% transparent with their accounting and sales numbers. Less their publishing and marketing expenses, the book had earned around $27k, which they rounded up to $30k. Just last week that money was donated to [No Kid Hungry](http://www.nokidhungry.org/), an amazing organization dedicated to working to ensure that no child in the U.S. goes hungry. So far they've served 775 million meals to children across the country.\n\nMeathead, the team at Chefsteps, Andrew, and I could not be happier with how this all turned out and I want to thank the folks at Callisto Media for not just acknowledging the problem, but for dealing with it swiftly and transparently.\n\nAnd if you are looking for a great organization to donate to (before tax season!), please take a look at No Kid Hungry and what they do.",

I am probably just paranoid but after what's happened with Lucky Peach and Saveur I am very concerned about the site going under or suffering a decline in quality. Has anyone else noticed this?

        "text": "I'm making wings for a superb owl party this weekend and I wanted to do the oven-fried recipe. (I tried the confit wings, but it's just too much oil.)\n\nThe problem: there will be somewhere between 8 and 12 wing eaters there, and I'm making 8 pounds of wings. (I don't think it'll be enough either... I made a 4lb test batch and 2 people blew through it). I don't have the fridge space to put all 8 pounds on racks overnight. I can batch the cooking part, but I'm not sure what to do about the overnight dry. (Empty my fridge and hope it's cold enough outside? Put everything in my fridge into coolers? Also, I'd need more racks...)\n\nMy possible solution: Cooks Country's recipe for oven wings is remarkably similar to the SE one, but instead of an overnight stay in the fridge, the winds are almost \"reverse-seared\" instead - after a toss in baking powder and salt, they're probably into a low oven and allowed to render and dehydrate, then the heat is cranked up to get them crisp. \n\nMy questions: has anyone tried this method versus the SE method? If so, how does it compare? \n\nIt seems like the CC recipe may actually have the advantage on crispness - instead of relying mostly on dehydration, they also do some rendering through the low temp cook. (Sort of like the SE confit recipe.) SE probably has the advantages on flavor due to the prolonged salting.\n\nAnyway, if no one has done it, I might just try both methods and report back.",
