When I entered college I knew I wanted to do something in the sciences, but I wasn’t quite sure which branch of science so I chose math because I liked it and because it is a very broad degree. However now that I am starting to get into the higher level proof based courses I am still liking math, but I am realizing that I don’t want to go past undergrad for math or do any of the standard math industry jobs (actuary, high school teacher,etc.) and that I am actually more drawn to chemistry and biology after some courses I’ve taken. However I am a fair bit into this degree and changing seems irresponsible. I could change to a chem degree and graduate on time, but it would be quite a packed last two years of college. My other option is finishing my math undergrad and taking more electives in the sciences giving me a total of 5 chemistry courses, 2 physics courses, and 4 biology courses when I graduate. How marketable would this math degree be if I wanted to go to grad school for biochem, immunology, or organic chemistry and work in a wet lab setting in industry? I think the math background would be good with the data analysis techniques being brought into biology and chemistry.",

        "text": "For someone studying differential geometry, a well-known motivation for spectral sequences comes from trying to generalise the Mayer-Vietoris sequence for de Rham cohomology to a similar result for a countable open cover. This can all be found in Chapter 8 of the great book *Differential Forms in Algebraic Topology* by Bott and Tu.  \n\nWhen motivating this generalisation, we usually start by using the standard Mayer-Vietoris short exact sequence to create an isomorphism between the de Rham cohomology of X and the cohomology of a bicomplex formed from all of the cohomologies of both the open sets and their intersection. A more-complicated but ultimately similar spectral sequence is then used to phrase the generalised Mayer-Vietoris sequence. \n\nI'm a little bit confused about something: using the standard short exact sequence for the binary form of Mayer-Vietoris, we can expand this out into a long exact sequence that relates all of the de Rham cohomologies as found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayer%E2%80%93Vietoris_sequence#Cohomological_versions).\n\nIf the spectral sequence/bicomplex actually *rephrases* the binary Mayer-Vietoris sequence, then in principle there should be a way to read the above long exact sequence off of the spectral sequence. Is this actually true? Moreover, is there an (even longer) long exact sequence that can be read off of the spectral sequence for the more-general case? I suppose we can create such a sequence for a finite open cover, but perhaps not for a countable one.",

        "text": "She said she was a real slut back in college, made me stop and think. (4 years of college x 365 days a year)200 guys = a new guy every 7.3 days. Since she said 200 well round it off a new guy every 7 days. Given that she had sex with a guy an average of three times and a average dick length of 5.5 inches and about 100 thrusts to cum were looking at.. 100 thrusts × 3 times per guy x 11 inches (5.5 in and 5.5 inches out= 3300 inches of dick per week. 3300 inches of dick x 208 weeks=660000 inches of dick=10.45 miles of dick. I got in my car and drove 10.45 miles and thought about dicks being laid end to end. Thats how much dick she has taken. She isn’t my girlfriend anymore.",

So I'm wondering what kinds of things game theorists work on, what broad subfields there are, and such. Thanks!",

        "text": "Hello,\n\nI contacted a friend of mine, who pursues a PhD in math. We were discussing how common it is among grad students to fall into depression and to consult a therapist.\n\nConsidering I plan to pursue post-grad in math also, I felt it is necessary to mentally train myself to overcome mental stress. In other words, To become resilient and determined enough to overcome any psychological challenge.\n\nI started searching for books and found _Resilience by Eric Greitens_ to be very promising. However, I am still confused how would anyone sharpen her skill in this respect. How to mentally train my-self to push my limits to their max? I am math guy not an athlete or soldier. \n\nWhat about you? How do you train yourself? Any thoughts?",
