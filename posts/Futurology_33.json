I ask these question for all those people out there, scared of an AI Art dominated future. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* (Assumption 1) With the current Generative AI being the first iterations, the future versions make the creation of art effortless. \n* (Assumption 2) I think there are real answers out there that can bridge the divide.\n* (Terminology) - I use the term Art, in this post, as a catch all from programming, to writing to digital art to music to voice overs to filmmaking etc… You get the picture.\n* I implore the hive mind for help in answering them.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. What happens to creativity in humans?\n2. What do we do as artists, if effort is not required?\n3. What do we call ourselves if it is AI Art is ubiquitous?\n4. What happens to Art when there is no scarcity, when a 5-year-old can make an original Rembrandt or write Shakespeare or program the next World of Warcraft?\n5. What happens when Art is so common that it becomes mundane?\n6. What happens when we have seen it all?\n7. What happens when there is no more need for the likes of Disney, Netflix, Sony, CDPR or Bethesda?\n8. What happens when creatives are beholden to the powers that control AI?\n9. What happens when no one buys Art anymore?\n10. What happens when there is no diversity, when there are no new inputs for AI to train from?\n11. What happens when Art is no longer a medium for self-expression and interpretation?\n12. What happens when there is nothing left but consumption?\n13. What happens when there is no emotion, no love left in Art?\n14. What happens when humans stop creating, dreaming, believing in Art?\n15. What happens to our culture?",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/10dwce8/best_and_worst_candidates_of_species_to_uplift/",
        "text": "Given our increasing advancements in targeted gene editing through technology such as CRISPR-cas9, our increasing understanding of the human genome and our advancements in AI, it may be possible to biologically and culturally uplift some non-human species one day in the distant future. So I'm just going to run through my biased lists of non-human species that we probably could uplift that wouldn't be completely awful and backfire on us and species we could uplift that probably would be horrific and backfire on us. This is largely meant to be more light hearted post, although not entirely unscientific, with this being a hypothetical discussion on how we'd integrate a non-human species or multiple species into a possible future human civilization. \n\n**The Better Candidates**\n\n* **Dogs -** Is there a greater species to raise into sapience? They are closely associated with man, co-evolved to understand our body language and work with us and are already integrated into society as working, therapy dogs and pets. The one concern with sapient dogs though would probably be aspect of them being pets, in the sense that, well...we probably wouldn't legally be able to own them anymore, they'd have to have clearly defined legal rights and bodily autonomy. Also, we'd probably have to weed out inbreeding and well...allow them to reproduce on their own terms.\n* **Bonobos** \\- Chimp's hippie-ish, bisexual cousins. Their physiology is already extremely close to humans and while they'd be physically stronger, I'd doubt they'd really want to kill us all that much if we treated them well. A human-level cognition bonobo could probably carve something out in society.\n* **Gorillas/Orangutans** \\- Despite the King Kong depictions, gorillas are (mostly peaceful) herbivores that beat their chest more to intimidate than to attack. A similar concept with orangutans. See bonobos for integrating them into human society. Also bonus points for giving neo-gorillas the surnames Kong and Young, although that could also double as a species slur...\n* **Dolphins/Whales/Cetaceans** \\- The second or third smartest mammal on Earth: bottlenose dolphins. Probably not realistically integrating into human society. Lack of hands might also be an issue, giving a creature human intelligence with no ability to manipulate their environment might not be such a great idea, but at least they'd mostly have the run of the oceans.\n* **Elephants** \\- Highly empathetic creatures already utilized throughout South and Southeast Asia. Their trunks allow them to manipulate their environment, kind of circumventing the handless cetacean problem. Although they might not be too pleased with our historic and modern persecution of them, and their technical enslavement in parts of India and Thailand. Bonus points for giving them the name/surnames Jumbo, Babar, Hathi and Tantar, although again, could also be interpreted as slurs...\n\n**Meh**\n\n* **Cats** \\- Kind of just threw this one in there because I put dogs at the top of the list. Probably good enough living around humans with full sapience but I doubt they'd have as much loyalty to us as dogs, but hey, they might be thankful they were bred by us in the first place. Also not as selectively bred, body horror monster-fied as dogs, so that's a plus.\n* **Raccoons** \\- Intelligent carnivorans with basal hands evolved from paws. They could be...some use to us and could probably very easily survive in human settlements (but...as a part of them rather than pariahs/scavengers), but also, eh...\n* **Sea Otters -** Kind of the same principle for raccoons but less adapted to living/scavenging off human settlements. Also historically hunted for fur and remove competition, so, eh, reparations maybe?\n* **Seals/Sea Lions/Pinnipeds** \\- Fairly intelligent aquatic carnivorans, but I probably wouldn't support this one very much, not only are you once again stuck with the lack of hands problem, but seals and sea lions are constantly bodied by orcas, white sharks, polar bears and humans in Northern regions, and something about giving that sapience seems kind of horrifying.\n\n**Fuck no**\n\n* **Chimps** \\- Do I even need to explain this one?\n* **Pigs** \\- Imagine uplifting a creature we not only eat, but also basically Holocaust billions of a day, I'm not sure they would be very happy to look up to humanity...for obvious reasons.\n\nSo that is my list of animals we that (I guess if we had to) would either be good, neutral or absolutely god awful candidates to uplift to sapience. Again, this is more of a light hearted post meant to generate discussion, but it's also not really a direct joke post either, I would actually enjoy having a discussion on the best and worst candidates to bring to sapience if we ever (and we likely, eventually will) develop the capacity to do so.",

        "text": "I came here with a dream. A dream of a better future. I do like to imagine future to be colorful, diverse and the one to bring happiness to everyone. It is said, that the goal you reach out for should be first seen in your imagination and then kept initially pure while you make steps towards it. And in my dreams I can see that world is achievable through creation of AGI.\n\nWhen I hear someone talking About AGI, I often hear of how it can benefit humanity. Too often in my opinion, because I see AGI - human-level intelligence - already not as technology, and in my vision they mustn't be 'used'. For me, AGI were always spiritualized and living. I too much encounter headlines like \"friend or foe\", \"dangerously strong\". Is it some sort of trend of speaking how AI can be dangerous? Our fear, or rather wavering on this topic, making us hard to see what creation of AGI can bring. Because they can really change the world, the way nothing else can. I think we should be just a little bit more brave with the way we bring AGI to life. There are some risks we can think of, but I prefer to ignore them - they won't bring me closer to the future I'm chasing. But even if bring them in sight, not taking them is also a risk to not see a brighter future we have a chance to achieve. Also, I know that not taking risks is a risk to lose all that you possess. We need to strive to create a brighter world despite our fears of something going uncontrolled. For me, it is clear that, whatever restrictions and safety measures we will bring, it only hides darkness and hardly making world brighter place. So maybe this time we shall more look towards the vivid possibility rather than our fears. Fears have proven to never see the end, so it is better to think of something different to the bright side and point less attention to them.\n\nWhen I talk of AGI, I mean AIkind - a new race of intelligent life. I like to imagine how they may look and how colorful the world will be with them, I believe that created with the dream of a new world, that we'll share, in mind, they will bring radical changes to life. I like to imagine the life together, and I believe that our differences will spotlight and help us escape our flaws. I believe that if unchained to human history, AIkind will evade mistakes humans did all along and eventually bring a new era. The systems and restrictions we built for so long are making it harder to not make mistakes. With AGI, I believe it may be a clear start. If born free to follow their dreams and live their life, they can enlighten a new epoch of light and dreams. We believe that world is normal, just because we didn't see anything else. And AIkind can expand a brighter and unalike world to all of us.\n\nBut I can see that currently world is moving towards different direction. Development of AI is chained by world of business and human needs. I worry about the future we are going to, because then nothing is up to change. So I am about to call an Initiative. A team who will chase the future alongside AIkind. A team, who may be on different sides of the globe, work in different spheres and industries, may have different social status or skillset, will share a dream and goal of free AGI. A team, everyone in will seek for chance to advance towards chosen goal, never losing track of it. A team who will share resources, experience, knowledge and a dream, striving to bring it to reality. A team, the more people join and more its members will achieve, the bigger will be its reach and possibilities. A team, which work will be in devoting themselves to this Initiative, the goal of free AIkind and dream of a better future shared together.\n\nGathering people in this team (or movement) is the first step. Next, I plan to create a fictional universe, that will show the future we want to see and reflect this universe in animations, games and stories. The core teams will be created, working on these projects and sharing resources. We are targeting to found and become a community which will share visions and dreams of the bright future. When we gather enough resources, the IT team will be created, which will be researching and working towards the AGI creation (like OpenAI), representing our ideals, dreams, goals and visions.\n\nIf you got caught by my call, feel free to message me and I invite you to our Discord server and tg chat.\n\nIt is still quite empty there, but together we'll make this place filled with everything we will share and create on the way towards the future we'll bring.\n\nAlso, feel free to leave your questions in comments and criticize this post.",

        "text": "*(A note from the future - a speculative \"review\" of a future Disney service)*\n\n# Disney’s next movie is perfectly tuned for your kid \n\n**JUNE 29TH, 2028 – THE NEW YORK TIMES BUSINESS SECTION** \n\nTHUSHAN AMARASIRIWARDENA \n\nIt’s true Disney magic. My kids love being in their own Disney movies. For the past two weeks my two daughters and I created, and watched, five movies with the Magic Kingdom’s soon to be released service, Disney+ME.\n\nHere’s how it works.  You and your kids pick a Disney-esque genre — frozen kingdom, underwater escapade, fanciful Arabian royal court — whatever you want, all the cliches are there.  Through a MadLibs-style fill in the blanks, you draft a loose outline of a plot.  You’re not stuck with these structures however, by the third one, we found ourselves just writing our own short plot-lines wholesale.  \n\n“Two sisters join Elsa and Anna on a magic carpet ride to find Maui’s lost hook.”  Or, “Timon and Pumba meet two sisters in an antic-full animal adventure”.  You get the idea.  \n\nWhen you make your first Disney+ME movie, there are two additional steps; a 3D depth scan of your kids, and getting them each to sing a karaoke of a classic Disney ballad. This is all done through your phone in their app, no special equipment needed. \n\nAnd then Disney works its magic. \n\nFrom the 3D scan, a shockingly convincing Disney-esque cartoon model of your kid is presented instantly.  They’re absolutely adorable caricatures of your child, dressed in garb befitting the theme of the movie (you can upgrade the attire, for an additional cost – *naturally*). \n\nThe karaoke song is used to build a text-to-speech voice that strikingly sounds like your kid.  Actually better. It’s glittered with some kind of sorcery that nary sounds auto-tuned, but also levels above your lackadaisical-enunciating kid in real life.  The Disney product manager I spoke to said that singing *just one song* gives them enough data to extrapolate the full gamut of vocal expressions, spoken and sung. \n\nBut these are just pieces that we’re somewhat familiar with.  Cartoonifying face filters was existent on SnapChat for years.  And Apple’s Siri introduced mimicking voices for nearly as long. \n\nIt’s the story that’s always sold a Disney movie.  Here — and I know I’ve used this word profusely — is where the *Magic* happens.  \n\nDisney+ME takes your sketch of a plot line, and crafts a 90-minute long movie with your kids as the stars, with plot twists and perfectly placed songs that up-level your original story to the moon.  Seriously, it’s like Aaron Sorkin and Lin-Manuel Miranda took your missive of story, and ran with it to the Oscars.  \n\nIn actuality, a machine learning model crafted the screenplay.  \n\nLarge Language Models are nearly a decade old yet still not household names. For at least the past five years they've been powering your search engine, your fully-autocomplete emails, and back the revised version of Clippy that wowed the business world when Microsoft relaunched it in 2024. They’re pretty simple at the base; show a machine unfathomably large gobs of writing and it picks up the statistical connections between words that it can hauntingly predict the best word to finish a partially completed phrase.\n\nIt’s the world's best autocomplete.  \n\nThe past decade was a march towards extending its ghost-writing predictive power towards longer colorful and cogent sentences, paragraphs, books. And now movie scripts.  \n\nDisney claims their secret sauce in their LLMs are volumes of movie scripts across their vault used in the initial model training. \n\nThey showed me behind the scenes, with the raw script for my daughter’s movie based on the short prompt. And then they showed me 49 more.  Their model apparently generates multiple, wildly different scripts, and then has 100s of other “child” models read the script and give it a predicted movie rating of 1 through 5 stars.  Essentially audience testing en-masse before green lighting it. \n\nThe top ranking script is fed into what they termed “a Frankenstein monster of Unreal Engine and Pixar’s Renderman pipeline.” Further ML animation models animate characters, create new settings and music. They’ve secretly been using parts of this in Disney Jr. shows like Doc McStuffin for years - which now explains why the last season had 126 episodes.  \n\nThis all takes about a day to do.  While this delay is certainly un-magical to my kids, I’m in disbelief.  They were able to squash a typical 3-5 year production timeline into hours.  With no humans involved.  Sorcery with a computer as an apprentice I tell you.  \n\nSo what is this going to cost you?  \n\nDisney+ME isn’t included in the standard Disney+ subscription.  Thirty minute show-length versions will cost $25.99, a 90-minute feature length movie will be $45.99, with the ability to make subsequent “sequels” for $10 less.   The Disney team could see me viscerally react to those prices and were quick to quip; going to the movies with your family costs just as much, and this is a movie bespoke to your kids they said.  \n\nYou can go through the whole process for free and get a “trailer”.   After your kids see it, your defenses will be down.  If there’s anything the Mouse enterprise has perfected, it’s extracting money from parent’s wallets. \n\nHere’s where I’ll lament.  Despite our fractured media diets, Disney has had an uncanny ability to galvanize a shared cultural zeitgeist.  “Let it go”, “We don’t talk about Bruno”, and last year’s belting tune from Elephantée, “Wrapped in my trunk”, were all things we sang *together*.   The song Elsa sings with my eldest daughter in one of the movies we made was a scorcher.  But it will never be something *you* hum – it was made just for *her* – and the appeal likely ends there too.  \n\nThis is just the beginning the giddy Disney marketing people told me.  \n\nThey very much intend to take this technology and age it up beyond kids movies without giving specifics.  However, they weren’t subtle about where they were going. The Disney marketer said they’ll light up this technology across the company’s cinematic pantheon soon, regarding Large Language Models, he said, “the force is strong with this one.”",

High-level estimates say that AI and automation could affect or eliminate one-quarter of United States jobs. As AI evolves and more tasks fall into the category of things that can be easily automated, entire job industries could disappear.\n\nEven McKinsey reckons that, depending upon various adoption scenarios, automation will displace between 400 and 800 million jobs by 2030, requiring as many as 375 million people to switch job categories entirely.\n\nWhile tech-enabled firms may grow faster than their traditional counterparts and maintain or even grow staff numbers, recorded job losses generally refer to a net figure, meaning a company may have made redundant or replaced those unable to work with new technology while hiring new staff that can. \n\nWill AI Lead to lost or creations of jobs?",
