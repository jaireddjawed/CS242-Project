        "text": "On December 30th, after posting a variety of queries all over the web about [my situation](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/109bgs4/when_im_gone_for_work_something_happens_in_my/), my sister—with whom I was currently staying with—was visited by a man wearing a tan suit &amp; red tie.\n\nAfter we heard a knock at the door, I looked through the peephole and asked who the hell it was.\n\nMuffled from the other side, a stern voice announced himself. “Well, I’m not the goddamn mail man. Your name is David, right? Age 28, you’re an accountant. Born and raised in Houston, now resides in Amarillo. I’ve seen your shit.”\n\n“What the fuck?” I thought. Turned towards my sister, she shrugged with this baffled look.\n\nWas hesitant to allow sis to approach the door, but she did anyway.\n\n“Excuse me, this is a bit too much. Are you FBI or something?” my sister said.\n\n“No. But allow me to help you with this thing you got going on,\" the stranger responded. \"You allow me a few moments of your time. If this isn’t some kind of hoax for internet clout, I think I can identify your issue, and maybe even find a solution. Whaddya say? At the very least, I can get your story out there.”\n\nI open the door ajar. The strange man waves, and I allow him to step in. My guard was up.\n\nHe requested my sister to get chairs for us all. We propped them up facing each other in the middle of the apartment.\n\n“You can address me as Yoel, by the way,” he said and then shook our hands.\n\n“It’s nice to meet you, I’m Cindy,” my sister responded. We all sat down to have a trio conservation.\n\n“So…what are you exactly?\" continued Cindy.\n\n“Enough small talk,\" Yoel said. \"Questions: have you spoke to the police yet, David?”\n\n“No,\" I said.\n\n“Why not?\" Yoel asked.\n\n“Because—I don’t know—it just happened, and what do I tell them? Truth be told, I planned on going to the police tonight with these damn recordings if nothing came out of what I was posting. If I tell them to go to my house and arrest whoever this imposter is when he’d normally be there, they should be able to just arrest this guy, right?”\n\n“So, no contact with police as of now? That’s perfect,” Yoel said.\n\n“That’s perfect?” I asked.\n\n“Next question, and this is a big one. . . Have you made any direct contact with your doppelganger?”\n\nI denied.\n\nHe continued. “On your days off, when you’re not working, do you notice anything strange? Do you see things from the corner of your eye? Frequent nightmares than normal?”\n\nI denied once more.\n\nYoel’s hands rubbed together. “That’s all good news. This is a lot easier on my end.”\n\n“I’m sorry, but what’s going on here?” My sister interrupted. “Honestly, if you’re not police then this is a waste of time. I fucking told David that regardless of how much this person resembles him, he’s just a guy that needs to have his ass arrested. Yet, he insists on looking for solutions on the damn internet.”\n\n“It’s called spontaneous clairvoyance,” Yoel snapped back. “Have you ever had the ‘irrational’ feeling that something isn’t right? You ever took the longer path home because something about your usual route gave you chills? Why do you think it's so hard to sell a house where a murder has happened? Listen, I’m about to bring you two into a whole new world. And I can name about ten different reasons, off the top of my dome, why bringing law enforcement into it is a bad idea.”\n\nYoel then took out some kind of book from his briefcase. The cover of which had no title, with strange carvings all over the dingy fabric. He then flipped through its pages. “I’m what you might call a: 'supernatural investigator,' alright?”\n\nCindy rolled her eyes. “Like Zak Bagans?”\n\n“Sure, toots,\" Yoel said. \"Listen, go on ahead and bring up that recording you claim to have. Need to see this for myself.\"\n\nI got up and did what he asked, with no doubt in my mind of getting conned. Was about two seconds from kicking this guy out of my sister’s home. Nonetheless, I got the computer and opened the files.\n\nI explain to him my routines, what I like to do at home. Then showed him the times of myself leaving and this other 'me' entering soon after. As skeptical as sis was, she couldn’t resist goosebumps and a pale face every time she was shown this footage. I expected to glance over and see this apparent con artist trying to hide a smirk, but he was intensive, as if watching some documentary.\n\nYoel gradually eased his way to controlling the timestamps. We spent the next 20 minutes in silence watching, analyzing. Eventually, while Yoel flipped through more timestamps, something caught his eye. He paused the video, made sure the volume was turned all the way up, and then resumed. \n\nAt this time, the other me chatted on the phone. He had whoever was on the other line on speaker.\n\nThis is when we discovered the very thing I cliffhanger'd my last post on. My sister’s voice, as clear as day, was coming from the speaker volume.\n\nCindy gasped.\n\nYoel paused the footage. “Convinced now? Now I know for sure exactly what this is all about. So, let’s get down to business.”\n\nCindy reached over to fiddle with the video slider and replay the same part. She put an ear to the speaker. “I can’t believe it. It’s literally me. Whoever that girl is sounds like me to a tee.”\n\nYoel nodded. “Indeed. What I’m about to say will sound outlandish, but let me explain what I believe this is. David, you—my friend—have caught the eye of a Mimic.”\n\n“A fucking what?” Sis and I said, simultaneously.\n\n“Lookie,” Yoel said as he gestured his book towards us.\n\nWhat we saw on the palimpsest pages was bone chilling. Imp-ish monstrosities with one eye, round body, skinny arms &amp; legs, razor sharp teeth and hardened, green skin with a slimy texture.\n\nYoel continued. “Disgusting, is it?”\n\n“Um…it’s horrible,” Cindy said.\n\n“Okay, but what do you mean I’ve 'caught the eye' of this thing?” I said.\n\n“I’m not quite sure myself, to be honest,” Yoel said. “Does your family have any history with witchcraft? Maybe your great, great, great, grandfather had some generational curse placed on him?”\n\n“I wouldn’t know,” I stuttered out.\n\nYoel went on. “Okay. Well, then we’ll have to assume you’re one unlucky bastard. You see, hauntings and possessions are due to two factors these days. Either a long-ago generational curse or being at the wrong place at the wrong time. Maybe somewhere with a lot of bad history, trapping negative energy within it, to then be a gateway &amp; attraction for heinous entities. Or maybe you’re just the right type of person, but that can’t be quantified. Either way, I don’t know when, but somehow, someway, this thing noticed you. It’s attached to you. It’s goal, for now, is to copy you to the finest detail. It can manifest aspects of reality that are associated with you: your entire body, your clothes, your voice, the sound of your sister's voice over the phone, or anyone you've ever spoken to in the proximity of your home. All imitations.”\n\nI laughed. “Okay, okay. What the fuck, man. What is this? You expect to me to believe this shit? Who even are you?”\n\nYoel held up a finger. “Like I said, I’m a supernatural investigator.”\n\n“Yeah, a con artist,” I retorted.\n\n“Man, the human mind is a bitch, ain’t it?\" Yoel said. \"You just watched an entity not only pose as you, but simulate your sister’s voice perfectly, but you still won’t make any leeway? Because the brain will try to keep you programed against instances of abnormality. Listen, you wanna go back to a normal life? You need to twist the key, a key that's been given to you by making contact with this thing. Open your mind to this new world. Accept it, undeniably.”\n\nI took out my phone. “Fine. Assuming ghost, ghouls and all things that go bump in the night exist, what’s stopping me from recommending a SWAT team on this monster?”\n\nYoel chuckled, briefly. “Sure, go fuck off to the police. Yeah, piss off the overly attached alien living in your home. Better yet, let the government be aware of your attempts to get local authorities involved in the paranormal. Let’s see how far you get. It’s amazing you haven’t been sniped already.”\n\nMy sister, who’d turn silent in this conversation, spoke up. “David, let’s hear him out. It won’t hurt. Yoel, let’s say you’re right. How do we stop it? And what do you mean by ‘overly attached’?”\n\n“Finally, intelligent questions,” Yoel smiled, put one of his legs over the other, and rested his cheek on his fist. “First things first. The primary motivation for a Mimic is love. This thing is in love with David and doesn’t wish him any harm. Yet.”\n\nMy eyes widened. “Yet?”\n\n“Focus. There are reports of Mimics killing, what we’ll refer to you as, its lover. As for when this happens is unclear, but it takes a long while for that to happen. If it even does. Could take years, or months. I doubt it’s been in contact with you that long,” Yoel said.\n\n“Kay, cool, but we’ve yet to reach a solution. What. Do. We. Do about it?” Cindy said.\n\nYoel sat up, put his hands flatly together, and aimed at me. “Simple. I have a plan. Step one: David, you’re going back home.”\n\n“Hell no,” I said. “Are you out of your mind?”\n\n“This thing’s goal is to copy you, right?\" Yoel said. \"It can’t do that if you’re not there. Ask yourself: how do you think it knows so much about you? You think it leaves when you return home. But in reality, it merely dematerializes itself. It’s always watching ya’, David. When you're not working, it's an invisible force bound to your home—a stalker. In your bedroom, living room, bathroom, no matter what. Wherever you are, it’s there. According to the book’s limited knowledge about these things, you’re spiritually connected to this thing, which will allow it to channel you. Either of you understand with this means?”\n\nSis and I shook our heads.\n\n“David, just by being here you’ve put your sister at risk. You’re a danger to everyone. If it realizes you’re not returning home, it will use its established link to follow you. Get it?”\n\nCindy grabbed my shoulder. “Screw that. I can’t let my bro spend another night with that thing sizing him up. If it wants to come here, then fine.”\n\nYoel put his fingers to his forehead and sighed. “Don’t be ridiculous. No offense. There’s a reason men and women who live alone are the primary interest of these things. If it spots you with your brother, it may be jealous and tear you both to shreds. But, hey, at the end of the day, it’s David’s call.”\n\nI thought for a second, but needed less than that to know there wasn’t a way in hell I was gonna endanger my sister…if this really was all true. “Okay. I’ll do it.”\n\n“But—”\n\n“Please, don’t argue,” I anticipated a rebuttal from Cindy and replied sharp. “Look, most likely, this guy is crazy, right? But on the off chance, what kind of fucked up brother would I be to risk it? So, let’s say I go back home. What then, Yoel?”\n\n“Live your life,\" Yoel said. \"Do the things you normally would do. And for goodness’ sake, don’t act so damn suspicious. Pretend you’re totally clueless of it. You called off work, yet?”\n\n“Was planning to,” I said.\n\nYoel waved his finger. “Don’t. Keep working. Give it time to come into your house when you’re gone. Let it do its thing. Await further instructions.”\n\n“What’s in it for you then? You expect me to pay you or something?” I asked.\n\n“Good you asked. There is a price, actually. Not monetary. All I ask is that you become my client,” he said.\n\n“Your client, huh?” I asked with a suspicious tone.\n\nYoel had a big grin on his face. “Correct. That just means you allow me to record and post your story. That’s my schtick. My job is searching for people like you with abnormal cases. But broadcasting them online is a little extra thing I like to do sometimes; call it a hobby.”\n\n“So, you’re using David and his fright as a guineapig for entertainment?” Cindy said.\n\n“Like Zak Bagans,” Yoel said with a wink towards Cindy. “In all seriousness, you’re acting as if David wasn’t already trying to get his story out there to begin with. Besides, people are a lot more open-minded than you think, trust me. Maybe someone could help. Who knows. In any case, I’ll be doing research while you’re living your ‘blissful’ life. Meanwhile, you can type me a detailed account of everything that’s happened to you thus far. You don’t have to be a writer or anything. I’ll do that part. I’ll revise &amp; pretty it up as a coherent story. Whaddya’ say?” \n\nI’ll admit, he had a manner that made me want to believe in him just a little bit. I took him on his offer. He soon left after I got his contact info and said I’d hear from him in the coming days. We decided it best to wait later into the night for me to return home, for obvious reasons. My sister made us dinner, after which I collected my few belongings. Gave Cindy a hug, told her I loved her, and said everything was going to be okay.\n\nThe drive home was filled with contemplation. It felt like I was doing everything wrong. As if every action I took up until this point was completely irrational. Every rational piece of wiring in my head, whatever function is responsible for making things make sense, screamed at me to call the police. Report a breaking &amp; entering. Let law enforcement go through with it. \n\nHowever, the more I focused on the footage I was able to capture, it gave me some kind of willpower to ignore those thoughts. It was eerie. Its feels like the equivalent of going against the body’s callings to breathe when you’ve been holding your breath for too long, or to blink when your eyes are burning.\n\nWhen I rode into my driveway, my lights illuminated the front lawn. My home had such a thick layer of darkness over it now, I couldn’t look at it the same. It took me a solid thirty minutes to muster up the courage to step into the black stretch of midnight over my porch.\n\nYoel said it was always watching. So where was it then? Given what the guy had said, I guess it wouldn't be possible to see it in person. \n\nEvery step towards the front door, a burning sensation came over me to look around. To see if I could spot anything. Yoel told me to act as natural as possible, but that’s a hard task. I cringed at every leaf that crunched under my boot, like I were announcing myself to the violator of my home as I walked to the front door.\n\nMy hands gripped the doorknob. Deep breaths. I opened the door to my house, slowly. Was ready for something to jump out at me as soon as I stepped in. My fingers fidgeted near the light switch to the chandelier, but I stopped.\n\nMy living room lamp was on already.\n\n“Whatever. Be natural.”\n\nI flicked on the chandelier anyway. Light engulfed my living room, and I let out an exhale at the sight of not a damn thing. There were some obvious screw ups by this imposter, though—whether intentional or not. The sink in the bathroom ran water, my pantries were wide open. One of my books were completely misplaced. This was the worst case yet. I wondered why it had been so blatant then. It seemed like before it was at least trying to match my behavior. Regardless, I cleaned up and didn’t show a single sign of distress.\n\nThis is where I’ll end this update. Through the first week of January, I've been living my life as normal. I've also been holding up my end of the bargain and typing up my accounts, including the one you’re currently reading, then giving it to Yoel so he can do whatever he needs to with it in order to share it with you all. Its currently the 6th as I'm writing this.\n\nIf you’ve made it this far, thank you. I'm not sure when Yoel will publish this, but he told me he'd like to debut the first of these accounts by the 11th. Hopefully, he kept to that promise. Assuming I'm not dead, the next update for you all should be pretty damn soon.",

        "text": "“From midnight of any given day to the next, you may only open your eyes for sixty seconds. Until your dying day, this shall be so.”\n\nThe thunderous voice rattled the very foundations of my house, but I disregarded the crystal-clear warning. Stupid, given how uneasy I felt. It was the most lucid dream of my life. That should have told me something. I should have realised it was more than a nightmare.\n\nWhen I awoke, I carried out my ordinary daily routine. I ate breakfast with my girlfriend, and we both went to work. My day seemed mundane. Just the way I like it.\n\nTowards the end of my working hours, whilst I was in the office bathroom, I noticed something strange. As I was washing my hands, something peculiar caught my attention in the mirror. The reflection revealed a pair of crisp, white brogues, which were protruding through the gap beneath a cubicle door. Until that moment, I hadn’t seen or heard anybody else in the room.\n\nWhen I turned to face the cubicle, I was horrified to find that the reflection had deceived me. There was nobody in the cubicle. There were no bizarrely-out-of-place white shoes. Nothing. Shaking it off as a trick of the light, I returned my gaze to the mirror.\n\nThat was when I screamed.\n\nWell, I tried to scream, but I was horrified to find that my voice-box had failed me. Petrified, and mouth agape, I gawped at the man who was standing in the now-open cubicle doorway. Well, he had the *shape* of a man, but that was all.\n\nHe was some sort of macabre mannequin. The creature had a hairless head made of stone, and its eyes looked like small, grey pebbles. A razor-sharp, horizontal slit served as a mouth on its white-skinned face. By that, I mean it was as white as a *sheet*. The same could be said of the stone man’s attire. The thing wore a white, collared shirt, white trousers, and white brogues.\n\nThe haunting entity raised a finger to its lips with purposeful poise. It soundlessly *shushed* me. At that moment, my reflection moved, even though I did not. My Mirror Self smiled demonically, before producing a saw. My reflection leant forwards, placing its left arm on the sink counter, and it began to saw at the wrist.\n\nI attempted to produce tortured sounds, but my throat felt as if it had been strangled. I silently bawled as an invisible tool severed my *real-world* hand from the wrist, mirroring what my reflection was doing. A torrential shower of blood poured from the wound that my Mirror Self had created. In a matter of seconds, it was all over. My lifeless, detached hand was lying in the sink, and I was tightly clutching my wrist, attempting to stem the bleeding.\n\nI hazily stumbled into the communal office area, making good use of my voice, which had *finally*returned. As my colleagues rushed to me, I fell to the floor and faded away. Whilst tumbling through some black chasm of an unconscious realm, that same disembodied voice spoke to me.\n\n“Non-compliance must be punished. One strike per day. The first strike is physical. The second strike is emotional. The third strike is *final*.”\n\nI opened my eyes to a hospital room. Streetlights shone through the window, and I was surrounded by doctors, family members, and friends. I concocted a story to explain my severed limb. It was a clunky fib about a mishap with a machine in the warehouse. My tall tale could *easily* have unravelled if anybody had asked questions, but I think my friends and family were simply glad that I was okay.\n\nAfter a solid hour of talking to a room full of people, I was depleted. I must have dozed off, and I woke to find that everybody had left. I was lying in a darkened hospital room, contemplating the horrors that had befallen me. I wasn’t planning on questioning the featureless demon ever again. The first strike had been gruelling enough. I squeezed my eyelids together, and a single tear trickled down my right cheek. I had never considered the pain that would come with a life of blindness.\n\nI jumped in horror at the return of my tormenter. This time, it did not come to me as a vision.\n\n“Too late,” A sourceless voice taunted. “It’s Tuesday.”\n\n*No*, I internally despaired. *A day has passed? How?*\n\nI assumed it had still been Monday. I should’ve kept my eyes closed. I had been high on all manner of medicine, and I thought I was safe. I thought it was still the day of my *incident*.\n\n“I only kept my eyes open because I thought I’d already been dealt a strike for the day,” I sobbed.\n\n“A new day,” The voice whispered. “Second strike.”\n\nSuddenly, the lights in my pitch-black room sprung to life. And what I saw was so horrific that I’m struggling to put it into words. I’ll try. In the chair to the side of me, I saw my girlfriend. Lucy. She hadn’t gone home.\n\nShe was still smiling at me, frozen in the position she had assumed earlier. Lucy’s skin was lifeless, and her clothes were soaked in blood. The bottom of her shirt had been lifted to reveal her disembowelled corpse. I wasn’t sure how my tormenter had inflicted such a dire, excruciating death without altering the contented expression on her face, but I didn’t *want* to know.\n\nYet again, I struggled to make a sound. I wanted to scream. I wanted to scream louder than I’d ever screamed before. I’d never felt such sorrow. I hammered the emergency button beside my bed, and staff rushed to the scene.\n\nThe days since that night have been a blur. I’ve faced so many questions from detectives, but I can’t give them the answers they need. They wouldn’t believe me, would they?\n\nI refuse to open my eyes. No matter how many times people encourage me to look at them, I keep my eyelids firmly pressed together. During the day, it’s fine. I don’t want to see the world, anyway. It’s at night that the ghastliness truly begins. I’ve been hearing things. Barely-audible scuttling noises ricochet off the walls of my box-room. Miniature footsteps, I think. When I open my eyes, the sounds stop, but I’m too scared to open them for more than a few seconds at a time.\n\nWhat are they? What do they want?\n\nI’m currently typing with my eyes closed. I hope the autocorrect function has been working. They’re about to discharge me from the hospital. I don’t know what to do. Even if you were to try, I don’t think you could help me. I just thought I’d tell my story.\n\nThis post is a warning. If the monolithic stone creature speaks to you, do as it says. I can’t offer more help, I’m afraid. Obeying its request might not even save you. After all, I still don’t know what I’m hearing in the dark.",

        "text": "Just moved into a new place. Was exploring the basement and found this letter buried in a closet:\n\n\"I can't tell if I'm dreaming. I suffer from severe insomnia. It usually happens when I'm afraid. I moved into a bad neighborhood recently, and I didn't sleep my first week of living there. I'd lay in bed, listening to gunshots down the street, hearing voices that sound like they're mere inches from my bedroom window; I swear the other night someone was jiggling my doorknob for hours on end.\n\n\nSo I decided to start spending my time at my boyfriend, Seth's, house. I felt bad even asking, we've only been dating a couple months, but it was my only option if I wanted to get some sleep. Seth was hesitant at first, feeling that we might be moving too quickly, but after seeing how terrified I was, he agreed. At least for a short while, until I found a new place.\n\n\nMy first night at Seth's was the best I had slept in months. I passed out before it was even dark out and slept into the early afternoon the next day. Seth greeted me with a smile, a kiss on the forehead, and a late breakfast in bed. Who knows, maybe living together could be good for us? Maybe I'll see the real him, and him the real me, and it'll make us that much closer. I felt safe with him. Maybe every night's rest would be as great as the first night's.\n\n\nIt wasn't. By the second night, I was wide awake yet again. I lay next to Seth, hearing nothing but the sound of him gently snoring. *Breathe in, pause, breathe out. Breathe in, pause, breathe out. Breathe in, *squeeeeak*, breathe out. Breathe *squeeeeeak* in, breathe out.* I sit up in the bed and look around the room. What was that squeaking sound? It sounded like it was coming from outside the bedroom, maybe in the kitchen. Did I imagine it? I listen closely... *squeeeeak, squeeeeak.* I sit up even taller in the bed, looking closely at the partially-open bedroom door. It sounded like footsteps, someone walking across the old hardwood floors just outside Seth's bedroom. I debate waking Seth, I debate stepping into the hall to see what the noise was. And then... I hear the floorboards creaking again, slowly growing louder, someone inching their way down the hallway and towards the bedroom, closer, closer...\n\n\nI squint my eyes to try and see into the pitch-black hallway. At first I don't see anything, absolutely nothing in the dark. But then it starts in come into focus... for the first time, I see it. It looks like a man, but I can't tell for sure. It stands just outside the bedroom door, its pale white skin barely visible in the dark; it's shockingly tall, probably close to seven feet; it's incredibly skinny, its entire body skin and bones without even a trace of muscle; it is completely naked, yet it seems as if it feels no shame.\n\n\nI am completely frozen. The creature simply stares at me, pressing its body against the wall as hard as it can as if trying to stay hidden. The thing that I find the most unnerving is that it has no mouth. It has no features I can see on its face besides those big, yellow eyes that look more animalistic than human. Despite its lack of a mouth, I can still hear it breathing... it's a muffled breath, as if its face is being smothered. You're dreaming, I tell myself. None of this is real, this can't be real. The creature slowly raises its hand and waves at me, and that is when I finally scream.\n\n\nSeth jumps awake, his face looking around the room frantically, before grabbing me by the shoulders and asking me what's wrong. I look at him for a moment, pointing at the door, but when I look back, the creature is gone. I tell Seth what I saw, and at first he looks at me like I'm crazy; but after some convincing, he walks into the hall in search of it. I offer to go with him but he tells me to stay in bed. Seth leaves the room, gone for a few minutes; I can't stop crying and shaking the entire time, terrified that the creature will return while Seth is gone. But Seth finally comes back into the room, shaking his head and saying that the house is empty.\n\n\n\"You probably dreamt it,\" he says.\n\n\n\"No!\" I yell. \"No, I haven't been able to sleep all night!\"\n\n\n\"Really? Because you were snoring just a few seconds before you started screaming.\"\n\n\n\"I...\" Was I? I swear that I was awake, that my insomnia was acting up again. But... maybe I was asleep... Maybe I did dream everything...\n\n\nSeth managed to fall asleep again after getting me to calm down. For the remaining few hours before sunrise, I don't take my eyes from the door. It was like that every night for the next few nights. Every, single, night. I spent every second watching the door, waiting for the pale, naked, scarred body to come into focus. The image of its face--that somehow mouthless face, and those horrifying, yellow eyes--flashed in my mind every time my eyes closed. I wait for it to return... but it doesn't. Not for those next few nights, at least.\n\n\nOn the seventh night, it finally returned. I was lying in Seth's bed, my eyes glued to the door once again. I feel like I could actually sleep. I don't know if I had ever gone this long without *any* sleep, even with my insomnia. Usually I won't go more than a couple days before I finally doze, but the way I'm going now, I feel like I could set a world record. I *could* sleep, but I won't. Not until I see that thing again...\n\n\n*Squeeeeak, squeeeeak.*\n\n\nI peak over the blankets a bit more, struggling to control my trembling breath as I wait for it to reappear. After a moment, there it is. It creeps into my view slowly. It stands in the doorway, not pressed against the wall this time, as if it isn't trying to hide from me any longer. It stands slightly hunched, its arms folded across its chest like it's cold. It blinks a few times as it stares at me, and then waves again. For some reason, I'm not as afraid this time. I had planned to wake Seth immediately at the sight of the creature, needing to prove to him that it existed, but now... I stare into the creature's eyes, eyes that now seem somewhat gentle. I squint to get a better look; I think its eyes are full of tears. It gives me one more wave, a shy one this time, as if it was embarrassed that I didn't wave back the first time, and slowly starts to walk away.\n\n\nI tell myself to wake Seth, to catch this monster invading his house... but instead, I get out of bed, and slowly begin to follow it. I watch from the doorway as it looks at a portrait hanging in the hall. It's a picture of Seth as a teenager with his family; his parents are standing, huge smiles on their faces; Seth's mom holds onto her newborn son, Seth's baby brother Jared. Seth told me that his entire family died just a few months after that picture in a tragic car accident. The creature stares at it for what feels like several minutes before going to the basement.\n\n\nI continue to follow. The creature starts down the basement steps, and, just before it reaches the bottom, it notices me watching from atop the staircase. I tense up, worried that it will attack, but it doesn't. It's hard for me to make out it's features in the dark, but I watch it blink a few times at me before turning and walking across the basement. I follow it into the back room, a small room that was packed with boxes and random junk. I wonder what the creature is doing in there when it suddenly pushes aside one of the boxes, revealing a trapdoor on the floorboards. The creature glances at me again. I'm close to it now, standing just a few feet away, yet I feel no fear. It bends forward, its lengthy knees cracking, as it open the trapdoor. I peak down inside, unsure of what I will find. And what I see horrifies me even more than the creature did the first night I saw it.\n\n\nInside the trapdoor is a small cell. It has no windows, no doors, no exit besides the tiny trapdoor on its ceiling. It reeks inside, smelling worse than anything I had ever smelled in my life, like it was stuffed with hundreds of dead animals. The wall is smeared with blood, shit, and scratch marks. A couple of long chains are fastened against the far wall. In the corner closest to the chains is a bucket overflowing with piss and shit. And next to the bucket is a framed picture. I have to squint to see what it's a photo of, but I'm almost positive that it's the same as Seth's family portrait hanging in his upstairs hallway.\n\n\n\nI look up at the creature, and for the first time, I can truly see it. It is no monster... it is a man. A starved, weak, beaten man. His body is even more pale than I initially realized, looking like he hasn't seen sunlight in years, if ever. The hair on his head is long and full of bald patches, as if he had spent years pulling his own hair out. His lips are sewn together shut. I listen to his muffled breaths once more as he tries and fails to get just a little air into his mouth. I flinch as he slowly reaches his hand towards me. He looks afraid at first by my reaction, but when I respond with my best attempt at a smile, he calms down. He places his hand against my cheek, tears in his eyes, tears in mine. He looks oddly familiar. I struggle to place it for a while when it finally clicks... He looks like Seth. He does... He looks like Seth, as if they could be\n\n\nThe man's eyes grow shockingly wide as he notices something behind me. I watch as he starts to open his mouth, blood and skin pouring onto the floor as he tears his stitching. He opens his mouth wide, blood staining his few remaining teeth, and screams. \n\n\nI turn to see Seth behind me. I see him for just a brief moment before he knocks me unconscious with the swing of a baseball bat. Darkness. I sleep for the first time in days.\n\n\nI awake in strange surroundings. Everything is dark. At first I think I'm in Seth's bedroom; or maybe I'm in my apartment. Everything that I just witnessed had to be a dream, it had to be. I squint to try and see where I am, but that does no good, I still see absolutely nothing. I'm amazed at how dark this room is, I've never experienced a darkness quite like this. I sit up and freeze once I hear the sound of chains. I shake my hands and hear them again, and I can feel them wrapped around my hands now.\n\n\nI squirm for a while, trying to get free. I kick and I fight for what feels like hours, but it is of no use. I am alone. I open my mouth to yell for help, when I notice that my entire mouth is numb. I open my mouth wide, trying and failing to speak, and I taste blood slowly dripping down my throat. I reach my hands to my mouth, just enough leeway on the chains so the tips of my fingers can touch my tongue... Or, I should say, where my tongue once was. I can see it now... my severed tongue sitting in the center of the cell, surrounded by a pool of blood.\n\n\nI think I screamed for days on end after that. Seth brought me a pen and paper after some time. I think he gave it to me just so I can communicate with him, but recently I've started using it to tell my story. How long have I been down here now? Days? Weeks? Years? Maybe all of this is just a dream. I think that's why I'm telling this story. Because, if just one person reads what I'm saying, then that has to mean I'm awake, right? And, if this is all real, maybe someone reading this can save me. If you're reading this right now, then I have to be awake. Right?\n\n\nThat, or perhaps you're nothing more than a character in this never-ending nightmare.\"",

        "text": " \n\nOnce there was a small village, hidden deep in the woods. The villagers lived simple lives, tending to their farms and raising their families. But there was one thing that set this village apart from all the others - a mysterious old mansion that stood at the edge of the village.\n\nNo one knew who built the mansion or why, but the villagers always avoided it. They whispered of strange noises coming from within its walls, and of ghostly figures that could be seen wandering the grounds at night. But one day, a group of curious teenagers decided to explore the mansion for themselves.\n\nThey pried open the front door and stepped inside. The mansion was musty and abandoned, and it seemed as though no one had lived there for years. They made their way through the dusty rooms, marveling at the ornate decorations and grand chandeliers. But as they ventured deeper into the mansion, the air grew colder and the shadows seemed to grow longer.\n\nSuddenly, they heard a loud, unearthly scream coming from the basement. The teens froze in terror, but one of them, a brave young man named Jack, decided to investigate. He descended the creaky stairs, and as he reached the bottom, he saw something that he would never forget.\n\nThe basement was a labyrinth of corridors and rooms, filled with strange and twisted experiments. Jack saw jars filled with preserved body parts and twisted instruments of torture. And then, he saw the source of the scream - a creature unlike any he had ever seen before. It was a twisted, monstrous thing, with eyes that glowed with an otherworldly intelligence.\n\nThe creature lunged at Jack, and he barely had time to turn and run before it was upon him. He sprinted up the stairs, but the creature was fast, and it was gaining on him. Just as he reached the top, he felt its cold, clammy hands grab hold of his ankle.\n\nHe kicked free and stumbled out of the mansion, slamming the door shut behind him. The creature was trapped inside, but Jack knew that it would not be contained for long. He ran back to the village and told the others what he had seen, but no one believed him. They thought he was insane, and that the mansion was just an old, abandoned building.\n\nBut Jack knew the truth. The mansion was home to something ancient and evil, something that would not be satisfied until it had claimed every soul in the village. And from that day forward, he lived in constant fear, waiting for the day that the creature would escape and come for him.\n\nYears went by, and the villagers continued to live their lives, unaware of the terror that lurked in their midst. But one day, the mansion's door burst open and the creature emerged. It began to hunt down the villagers one by one, dragging them back to the mansion to add to its twisted collection.\n\nThe villagers soon realized that Jack had been telling the truth all along and they banded together to try and stop the creature. But it was too strong, and it seemed as though there was no stopping it.\n\nAs the last of the villagers was dragged screaming into the mansion, Jack knew that it was all his fault. He had been the one to open the door, and now the creature was loose. He was the only one left, and he knew that it was only a matter of time before it came for him.\n\nHe sits alone in his house, waiting for the inevitable, but he also knows that no one will ever believe him again. His screams echo through the empty village, but no one is there to hear them.",

        "text": "Hello, I'm in need of help. I'm currently hiding in my closet, unsure of what to do now. I'm not leaving this spot, not with that psychopath in my house. Luckily I found my laptop with just enough power to type this out.\n\nIt was about three months ago when me and my now ex-boyfriend, Ian split apart. I just couldn't handle his weird behavior anymore. He was crazy, possessive, and got angry very easily. \n\nThe relationship didn't begin like this, he was different when we first met. He was nicer and calm, or so he appeared to be. \n\nI didn't know what was wrong with him, all I could do at the moment was end the relationship and beg him to get help. \n\nI wanted to forget about Ian, and just see him as someone in need of mental help. I wanted to be done with the whole relationship.\n\nLittle did I know, he was much more terrifying than I first thought.\n\nThis downward spiral began when I was in my bedroom, watching TV at the late hours like I usually do. My cat, butterscotch sleeping in the corner of my room. The entire break-up between me and Ian in the very back of my mind. Then, out of nowhere, I received a text message from an unknown number.\n\n\"Hello darling.\" The text read.\n\nSlightly confused by this, I ignored the text and didn't respond. I thought it was probably a scam number trying to convince me to give them all my bank information. Then I get another text:\n\n\"Why the \\*\\*\\*\\* are you not answering me?\"\n\nI read the text, more confused than ever, still, I didn't respond. \n\n\"Don't give me the silent treatment, answer the phone.\"\n\nAfter this message, I decided to respond.\n\n\"Hello? Who is this?\"\n\n\"Finally, you responded to me. Did you forget about me already dear? It's me, Ian.\"\n\nMy blood froze.\n\n\"Ian? How did you get this number? I got a new number, you shouldn't have it.\"\n\n\"That's irrelevant Ana. Anyway, I was wondering what you've been up to lately. It's been awhile hasn't it?\"\n\n\"Ian, please stop texting me, we're done. Remember?\"\n\n\"Oh I remember Ana....I remember the day you broke my heart and left me. That's in the past now, we can start over.\"\n\n\"No! We're not starting over, no stop texting me.\"\n\nAfter sending that message, I blocked his number and returned to watching TV, now more cautious than ever. Two hours passed and nothing else seemed to happen, eventually I got tired and went to sleep.\n\nAt 3 am, I heard my ringtone. Someone was calling me, I looked at the phone to see who it was, but feeling groggy my vision was slightly blurred, so I answered the call just in case.\n\n\"Hello? Who's this?\" I said, still trying to shake off the cobwebs of sleep.\n\n\"Hello Ana, are you having a good night's rest?\" I heard the all too familiar voice say on the other end.\n\n\"Ian? I blocked you!\"\n\n\"Yes you did, but I have my ways of contacting you, darling. Please hear me out..I w-\"\n\n\"No! I-I'm not taking you back, leave me alone!\"\n\n\"I knew you'd say that...\" (Click)\n\nAfter he ended the call I was on high alert, I couldn't go back to sleep. How was he able to call me even though I blocked him? My mind was in so many different places, I couldn't think. I couldn't focus on anything.\n\nCrash...\n\nThat's what I heard before hopping out of my bed. It came from downstairs, I needed to check what it was. I grabbed the baseball bat from my bedroom doorway, hoping that holding it would scare off the intruder. I exited my bedroom, ignoring my sleeping cat in the corner.\n\nI looked around the living room and kitchen for any broken windows. Then I looked at my backdoor, the window on my door was smashed, and the door wide open. I was terrified, thinking about who could've possibly broken into my home. I wanted to run for the hills, but where would I go? I have no neighbors, and the nearest police station is too far to walk to. I was trapped, with the intruder, and the worst part is, I already knew who it was. It was Ian, this isn't the first time he's done something like this, he'd break into my home to 'surprise me' after work. I didn't like it when he did that, and he didn't seem to care that I was upset, but he stopped doing it.\n\nI heard shuffling upstairs and ducked into a closet as quietly as possible. I heard hissing noises, then a shout, then a loud band, then horrible yelps coming from my cat, then silence. My cat was dead, and that psychopath was still roaming my home. I heard Ian opening every door in the house and looking everywhere for me.\n\n\"Ana....are you there? I know you're home alone...\" He said in an eerily cheerful tone. \"I just want to start over with you.\" \n\nI peeked from the closet to see Ian searching the living room, he was holding a large kitchen knife in his right hand. I scrambled to grab my phone to call the cops, but I couldn't find it anywhere. I saw it in the living room. Right where Ian was, I don't know what to do anymore, he won't leave my house. I know if I try to run, I'll be easily overpowered by him, I have a frail body. \n\n I'm certain that knife isn't for show, I can hear him laughing and talking, trying to lure me out of my hiding spot. What do I do?",

        "text": "I heard her sing to me every night before I drifted into sleep. \"Come, Riley\", she'd say, her voice softer than the breeze coming through my window; sweeter than the smell of the forest outside. \"Come meet me, Riley. I've been dying to meet you\" And though my eyes were closed, I could make out the shape of a little girl, around my age, white nightgown and blonde hair, standing just outside my window. And I felt so calmed by her that I'd very quickly fall soundly asleep.\n\nI was about eight years old when we moved to the house near the woods and, for the first days of living there, I couldn't sleep. I had heard my grandmother say all kinds of things lurk in the forest. Mysterious things. Scary things. Every time I lied in bed and closed my eyes, I would imagine those mysterious, scary things crawling into my bedroom, and I couldn't sleep. Yet, when I first heard her, I wasn't scared. She was sweet; just a little girl, like myself, and she never entered my room. She only stood there for the whole night, almost like a guard.\n\nEvery time I felt uneasy or afraid of what would come through my window, I'd hear it: \"come, Riley\", and I'd feel her standing there, watching me. \"I've been dying to meet you\". Over time, I started to wonder why she wanted me to come with her. And, a few times before I drifted into sleep, I did open my eyes when I heard her, expecting to catch her in my window while fully awake. I never did. I didn't understand how I could follow her. But I started to want to. \n\nI remember thinking just that one day. I heard: \"come, Riley\", and I thought, right as I was starting to dream, \"I want to.\" And, then, there she was, in my dream. We were in a beautiful forest, very different from the dark, gloomy one outside my house. It was bright. Lively. Lovely. She waved her hand at me and I followed, walking barefoot through the sunlit spots on the wet grass, feeling a light breeze ruffle my hair and the sweet smell of the forest fill my lungs. \n\nWe stopped near a patch of dirt. I looked at her, knelt, and started to claw at the ground. The dirt felt weird under my fingernails, but I didn't stop digging the hole. I revealed fabric; white fabric, flowy. I pulled out a perfectly pristine white nightgown from the dirt, and she looked at me. \"Now we can match.\" We smiled.\n\nMy parents tell me I had never sleepwalked before, and that they don't know why but that night they felt something was off. They checked my bedroom and saw me missing, the window open. They rushed out in desperation, running into the forest, our forest, gloomy, dark, and scary. They went deeper, deeper, calling out for me. \"Riley!\". My mother says she had been running for at least an hour before she finally found me. I was on my knees, dirt scattered all around me and over my pajamas. A dirty nightgown had been tossed to the side; there was a hole in the ground, and she thought I was cradling a rock, and when she came closer to look, touched my shoulder with a hesitant \"Riley?\", she saw what I was truly holding, and she let out a scream that finally woke me up.\n\nIt was the head of a little girl. \n\n. . .\n\nThe one I unburied first was called Carolyne. When I told my parents about the dream and the little girl calling me, still half asleep and unaware of the decomposed head I had just dropped to the ground, they barely understood, but they didn't forget. Many years later, they asked me about the girl in my dreams. \"Do you think this Carolyne wanted you to find the missing girls, and that's why she lured you to the forest?\" I nodded and agreed. \n\nAnd I didn't tell them that it couldn't be, because Carolyne was a brunette.\n\nThe police found six little girls buried in that same hole. They were in nightgowns, looking to be in the deepest, most pleasant sleep, and they had dirt under their fingernails. The nightgown I unburied did not belong to any of them. I'm sure that what called me for so long wasn't Carolyne or any of the other girls; none of them looked like her. I don't know what it was or why it wanted me to come, and I don't know what would've happened if my mother hadn't found me. I don't think about it. The only thing I think about is that, at eight years old, I had learned a very important lesson from my grandmother, and I just didn't understand it fully. \n\nThe forest is full of mysterious things. Scary things. And, sometimes, they don't want to crawl into your bedroom at night through the open window.\n\nSometimes, they ask you to come.",

        "text": " [Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1093o8d/the_tooth_fairy_killer_part_1/)\n\nAt the western edge of town, and with an outlook over the valley and river below, stands the town’s assisted living community. A single row of identical houses huddle together, all constructed from the same cream-coloured brick. Father Moore lived in number seven, his board paid for by the church he served for forty-five years.\n\nThe sun fought to break through a sky of bleak and monotone white. The morning air prickled the skin on my neck. I rapped on the door and heard a faint rustling from within. \n\nFather Moore is a man of eighty. Age has bent his back and he relies on a cane to shuffle his weary frame around his home. He blinked at me through the screen door, his blue eyes bright. He furrowed his brow, trying to place where, or if, he knew me. I held up my badge. He opened the door.\n\nThe television blared a report about the latest murder. Subtitles struggled to keep up with the live reporting. Father Moore motioned to the small two-seater couch and inserted his hearing aids and turned up the dials. \n\n“What can I do for you?”\n\nI pointed to the television.\n\nFather Moore narrowed his eyes and turned to the television and then back to me. “Terrible business. You hope such things will never touch you or your community. I know only what I have seen on the television I am afraid.”\n\n“You buried Jack Lassiter and his father Ivan.”\n\nHe sighed. “The days are few that I do not think of those two. They are both in the ground, thirty years now. What could they have to do with this?”\n\n“The three victims have all had teeth pulled.”\n\n“The Tooth Fairy.” He shook his head.\n\n“Some would call it a coincidence. Jack Lassiter dies after pulling his own teeth and now kids are showing up dead with teeth missing. In my line of work coincidences like that do not exist. I’m going to tell you something else. Something the press do not yet know. The three victims all had a parent who was in the room when Jack Lassiter died.”\n\nFather Moore’s face darkened. “Exodus chapter 20, verse 5. ‘For I the Lord, thy God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me.’ Ivan Lassiter carved the verse number on the gravestone of his son.”\n\nMy brain struggled to find a foothold. “God is doing this?”\n\n“My heavens no.” Father Moore clicked his tongue. “Jesus forgave. This is not God. It is the great Adversary.”\n\nI clapped my hands together. “People are dying Father.”\n\n“The final acts of Ivan Lassiter were confided to me in confession and in confidence. It is between him and God. My conscience will not allow…”\n\n“Three dead in three nights. What will be the state of your conscience if another dies because you refused to help?”\n\nFather Moore leaned his forehead on his cane. He took a deep breath and looked to the ceiling. \n\nYou will not find answers there, I thought, but did not say. I let silence do its work. What transpired on the day Ivan Lassiter died was the next piece of the puzzle. Without it we may not stop whatever was out there killing these kids. I needed him. His town and former congregation needed him. Father Moore shook his head slowly, almost imperceptibly. A clock mounted on the wall ticked incessantly. The news broadcast rehashed a summary of known events at the top of the hour. \n\n“It was a Friday,” he said. “Ivan Lassiter came into the church and requested a confession. He was drunk, that much I knew. I rarely saw him at Sunday service. But I complied. What he told me in the booth I took to be the ravings of a grieving man infected by drink. \n\n“The night following Jack’s burial, so Ivan said, he had prayed over the grave. His prayers were not answered by God, but by the Adversary, the Beast. Ivan bargained with him. He would give his blood so that his son could enact his revenge. The Devil appeared before him, cloaked in black, and accepted the deal. All it required was for Ivan to spill his own blood.”\n\n“What did you tell him?”\n\n“That grief passes if we give it time. I did not believe there was ever such a bargain. A dream perhaps, or a fantasy, but not reality. I advised him to return home and sleep and return to me in the morning. We would make better progress when we were both of clear mind.\n\n“He exited the booth and I sat there for some time. I did not know what to make of it. When I left the booth I witnessed the most terrible sight of my life. Ivan had slit his wrists and hung himself from the balcony with a tablecloth. His blood dripped onto the pulpit from which I gave my sermons. I mourned him and buried him.”\n\n“What are you suggesting?”\n\n“I am suggesting nothing Detective Hassell. You asked and I told. My conscience is clear.”\n\nI stood and took a pace towards the door. I turned back. “Where are they buried?”\n\n“Ivan in the town cemetery. Jack in the forest. I don’t remember the exact place. I never cared to return. Somewhere special to Jack. He counted the trees as his only friends, Ivan had said.”\n\nI nodded and moved to the door.\n\n“Good luck Detective Hassell.”\n\n\\----\n\nIf Father Moore couldn’t remember where the grave of Jack Lassiter was, I hoped there were others who knew. It took me the rest of the afternoon to find them.\n\n Derek McPharlin and Meredith Aimes, old school friends and parents to butchered children, had gone to visit a third friend from school, the father of Chrissie, the first victim. Speaking in person to Peter Yates had been top of my priority list until two more kids turned up dead. Now the three school friends, all who were in the room when Jack Lassiter collapsed and died, sat around the same kitchen table joined in grief. \n\nMeredith and Peter peered up at me suspiciously. Derek kept his eyes on the mug of coffee captive between his hands. It was Derek who spoke.\n\n“Shouldn’t you be searching for the killer?”\n\n“Why do you think I’m here?”\n\n“Do you think the killer is in this room?”\n\n“No. Does anyone here know where Jack Lassiter is buried?”\n\nI called Sergeant Wood and told him to patrol the streets without me that night. He had enough boots on the ground. I did not tell him where I was going, only that I was following a hunch. And with an officer stationed outside the house of everyone else in town who had been in that room when Smiling Jack died, we had our best chance of preventing a fourth straight night of horror. \n\nMeredith remembered best where to go. We drove up to the head of the trails, not far from where we found her daughter the night before. She explained that kids used to go to the grave site on dares, usually around Halloween. No one did it anymore. The whereabouts of the grave was not passed to the next generation. Most of the kids in town had no idea Jack Lassiter even existed. \n\nThe light was fading fast. The cloudless sky turned a shade of purple and the warmth vanished from the air. It would be another cold night. I asked Meredith if we were close. She responded by extending her arm. In the last of the light the dark silhouette of a gravestone rose up between the trees. \n\nWe gathered around. I shone my flashlight onto the lettering carved into the stone. Here Lies Jack Lassiter. And below it the bible verse requested by Ivan, Exodus 20:5. Derek asked if anyone knew the verse. I recited it as best as I could remember. Something about visiting the iniquities of the father on the children. \n\nDerek shuffled on his feet. “You don’t believe it?”\n\nI didn’t respond. I wasn’t sure what I believed. All I knew is that the common thread in this case was the people in the room when Jack Lassiter died, and the only living witnesses of the murderer described what could have been Jack himself. And then there was Ivan’s deal with the Devil. I had to rule it out, as mad as it sounded. \n\nI pressed at the ground in front of the gravestone with my shoe. Compared to the hard ground either side, it felt spongey. I dropped to my haunches and took a handful of black earth. The soil crumbled wet and granular through my fingers. It smelled as my grandfather’s vegetable garden had in the fall, a pungent mixture of life and decay. \n\n“What is the plan?” Derek asked.\n\nI shrugged. I played the flashlight around, searching the immediate area in the growing gloom. A stone’s throw away stood the remnants of a crude structure, the frame twisted and warped. \n\n“What is that?” I asked.\n\nMeredith said, “He built himself a cubby house out here.”\n\nI thought about what Father Moore had said. He didn’t have any friends so he made his own out in the trees.\n\nI stepped over to the structure and the others followed. I poked around and kicked at a rusted sheet of corrugated roofing. \n\nThe moon, a couple of days past full, rose above the horizon. The pale silver light cast subtle shadows on the dark forest floor. The cloudless sky and lack of wind brought in the fog once more. \n\nI sighed. We were on a fool’s errand. I should be back in town where I could at least be of some use. Someone was avenging Jack Lassiter, but I didn’t know who.\n\nFrom behind came a rustling. I figured one of the three parents had nipped off to relieve themselves. But everyone stood close by. Meredith had heard it too, her head turned back towards the gravestone of Jack Lassiter. She shrieked. A dark, shadowy figure stood before the gravestone. The figure turned towards the moon and held out its arms as if taking in the warmth of the sun. \n\nI trained my flashlight on the figure and yelled out, my voice sharp and jumpy. I caught a glimpse of black and white in the clothing. A pale face. Thin arms and legs. And then he ran, almost gliding over the ground and weaving through the trees. I sprinted after him but lost him on the darkness. \n\nI waited for the others to catch up.\n\n“You all saw that right?”\n\nThey all stared back at me, mouths agape.\n\nI grabbed the radio from my belt and called Sergeant Wood.\n\n\\----\n\nIt took almost an hour before we arrived at the Police Station. The descent through the forest was slow in the dark. Sergeant Wood demanded answers. I gave away only the details that were important. We saw someone matching the description of the killer at the grave of Jack Lassiter, and he had run through the forest and towards the town. That it appeared he had risen from the ground and was Jack Lassiter himself was a detail that would only invite incredulity.\n\nSergeant Wood checked in again with all the officers watching the homes of Jack’s former schoolmates and the cars patrolling the street, and no one reported anything. An hour dragged by and then another. I started to consider the possibility that I was crazy, that this case was getting to me and we were all jumping at shadows. Except I had three other witnesses who all saw the same thing. \n\nI asked to see the list of names of the people who had been in the room when Jack ripped out his own teeth and collapsed dead. There were ten names. Three were with me in the station. Another three still lived in town, their names highlighted. Of the four remaining: one died a few years back from a heart attack, one was in prison across the other side of the country, one moved overseas, and the fourth lived a few towns over, about an hour by car. \n\nI tapped the name. Marcus Krajicek. “Get me the local police station on the line.”\n\nI spoke to a Cadet on the front desk. She explained they were short staffed, they had sent a couple of cars over to help with our patrol. I asked her to send someone out to wherever Marcus Krajicek lived. \n\n“Have you had any reports tonight?” I asked her.\n\n“Only one. A local farmer coming back from visiting his brother picked up a hitchhiker. Said the hitchhiker was a strange kid wearing a tuxedo. He didn’t have any teeth. Smelled to high heaven. Thought he was up to something and figured we should know.”\n\n“How long ago?”\n\nThe clack of a keyboard sounded through the receiver. “Forty minutes ago.”\n\n“We might already be too late.”\n\nWe were.\n\nWe drove in silence, Sergeant Wood wringing his hands on the steering wheel. The lights flashed and he kept his foot down, but it mattered little. The radio crackled to life and announced they had found another victim. The six year old daughter of Marcus Krajicek was the latest and youngest victim of a merciless killer exacting revenge. \n\nEven though we knew what to expect, the scene was a grisly one. He used the garden shed like the first slaying. The floor was wet with blood. The smiley face drawn on the inside of the timber siding. Again two teeth missing, either side of the canine on the top row. \n\nI interviewed Marcus. He had no idea why someone would do this to his daughter. When I told him about Smiling Jack and the other victims he cast his eyes to the floor. He told me he always felt bad about it. It was one of the reasons he left town. He always felt responsible, and now doubly so. \n\nWe asked local law enforcement to keep the murder under wraps as best they could. At least for a couple of days. The press would not be up here asking questions. Not yet. \n\nThe local Chief asked if we had any ideas about who might have committed the crime. I nodded, but told him I needed a couple of days. The problem was I had no idea what to do. How do you stop such a thing? If we went back to the burial site of Jack Lassiter what would we find? Would it be empty? Would we come face to face with an undead monster who we could not kill? Such things were for stories written to scare children. \n\nWe gathered what we could from the site and jumped back in the car, exhausted. The sun rose as we rolled down the highway. When we reached the bridge over the river at the outskirts of town, Sergeant Wood broke the silence. \n\n“What now?” \n\n“We’re going to need some shovels.”\n\n\\----\n\nWe roped in Cadet Watts and weaved our way up the mountain between the redwoods. It was mid-morning before we left. Sergeant Wood took some time to inform the gathered press that there would be no press conference and no questions. He would catch some blowback, but he didn’t want to lie. In the meantime we would find out once and for all what lay in the ground in front of Jack Lassiter’s gravestone. All else could be dealt with after.\n\nSergeant Wood didn’t believe me when I told him the full truth. His initial anger at my keeping him in the dark was tempered by the ridiculousness of it all. But he was desperate and so we took a pair of shovels and our weapons and climbed up to the makeshift cemetery deep in the forest.\n\nAs we came nearer we heard voices from up ahead. I had spent enough time with them over the last couple of days to recognise who was talking. Meredith and Peter leaned on shovels. Derek cradled an axe in his right hand. Their heads snapped around when they saw us, like kids caught sneaking candy from the cupboard. \n\nThe ground lay undisturbed by their feet. \n\n“We’ve been here an hour,” Derek said. “Can’t bring ourselves to start.”\n\nI pushed through them and jammed my shovel into the ground and turned the first sod. I had to know. The ground gave little resistance. Someone had disturbed the soil recently. \n\nThe others joined and soon we excavated down to the coffin lid, a simple box of dark wood. I ran a hand over the smooth timber. The wood looked new, it could have been put in the ground yesterday. I looked up at Sergeant Wood. He leaned on a shovel and nodded. I gripped the edges of the lid and lifted.\n\nThe coffin lid came easily, as if the hinges were freshly oiled. Inside lay the corpse of a boy dressed in a tuxedo. His eyes closed, his skin white. I reached out a finger to touch the skin and then withdrew my hand. It was the strangest thing. He could have been alive and sleeping. There was no degradation of the body at all. There was something unnatural about it. This was no thirty year old corpse.\n\nThere was little doubt in my mind this was the same boy I had seen the night before. It had been dark, but I was sure. And then I noticed the detail that put it all beyond doubt. I put a finger to the cold skin of the boy’s chin and opened the mouth further to be sure. Embedded on the top row of his jaw were eight teeth of varying shape and size. The teeth of the victims. He was collecting them for himself.\n\n“What if he wakes up?” Meredith said.\n\n“Everything has happened at night,” I said. I checked the sky and found the sun, partially obscured by the canopy of trees above.\n\n“What is he, some sort of vampire?” Sergeant Wood said.\n\nI shrugged. I had no idea how this worked. Vampires were make believe, and yet here we had a perfectly preserved corpse that was reanimating at night and terrorising the community.\n\n“What do we do?” The thin voice of Cadet Watts voiced the question we all had. \n\n“We need a Priest,” Peter said.\n\nDerek scrambled into the hole and grabbed a limp arm. “Help me get him out.”\n\nDerek dragged the corpse to a thick fallen branch. He positioned the neck directly over the branch and told us to stand back. He lifted the axe above his head and brought it down with malice. The impact made a dull thud and the head rolled onto the forest floor. \n\nAfter a brief debate, we re-interred the headless body into the grave and filled in the displaced dirt. We wrapped the head in Derek’s raincoat and made our way back to town. The plan was to separate the head from the body and we hoped that would be an end of it all.\n\nWe waited until nightfall and took the head to the bridge. We dumped a few cinder blocks in a sack and under the cover of night dropped the head in the sack. I took one last look before we tied it off. As the moon rose and cast the first of its light, Jack Lassiter opened his eyes. The head opened its mouth and wailed. I stumbled backwards in fright and dropped the sack to the deck. Derek swept in as if gathering a fumbled football. He secured the top with a plastic zip-tie and dropped the screaming sack into the river. It made a dull plop and disappeared under the black water. \n\nWe watched the meandering water for some time. None of us knew what to expect. It felt too easy. \n\nDerek said, “It’s done.” And we left. \n\nThe killings stopped and the curfew was lifted. We had no killer to present to the press, but as happens with news cycles, everyone outside the town moved on to something else and forgot. Eventually the town will follow.\n\nI call Sergeant Wood from time to time. His small town is quiet again. \n\nI think about it often. I have nightmares. Of Jack Lassiter’s eyes and his scream. \n\nCadet Watts called me last week. He was working a night shift and took a call. It was a kid out of breath. Him and his friends were mucking around in the forest at night and saw something they couldn’t explain, what looked like a headless corpse roaming the forest. \n\nSmiling Jack Lassiter is searching for his head. I fear what happens if he finds it. \n\n [Me](https://www.reddit.com/r/SleeplessFromSundown/comments/y3ngzo/welcome_message/)",

I thought I wasn’t going to have to.\n\nThe other night, after the incident in the basement, I threw out the book. I threw it straight into the Dumpster and didn’t look back. I assumed that was the end of it. I went to my pet sitting with a clear mind and hopeful outlook.\n\nThe rest of the day went great! That immense exhaustion I was feeling wore off with each passing hour. I felt free. I even went into the basement to finish my laundry. No knocking. No sense of someone watching me. Scout hasn’t growled or barked or whined. I had a great night’s sleep, too, and woke up rejuvenated.\n\nI went out for breakfast. I completed other chores. I took Scout for a walk. All that silly paranoia and stress over a book. It was just a book. The more I pondered it, the more naive I felt. I couldn’t believe I let a book dictate my emotions and actions like that.\n\nEverything was going fine. I foolishly thought—even though this sounds absolutely insane—that I had beat whatever that book had done to me, whether it was just my mind making mountains from molehills, or if it magically was some shadow monster unleashed in my home. I thought I won.\n\nI had never been more wrong.\n\nWhen I got home from picking up dinner yesterday night, what waited for me on my coffee table as if I hadn’t touched it since the day before?\n\nThe book. *The book.* Wide open.\n\nI dropped the bag with my sub and chips, and my entire body froze.\n\nI slowly approached it, and even though I had left off on page nine, it was open to page eight.\n\n*There’s nothing you can do to get away.*\n\n*There’s nowhere to go that it won’t follow.*\n\nAn array of curse words met the tip of my tongue, but none broke through my lips. Before I could begin to process the absurdity of the situation, I realized something else.\n\nScout didn’t greet me when I came in. She hadn’t even made an appearance.\n\nI strode across the living room, my eyes glued to the book as I passed it, and called for my dog. I checked my room. Not there. I checked the kitchen. Nope. I checked the bathroom. Nothing.\n\nI continued to call her, louder each time. Small, rapid footfalls finally answered, ascending the staircase from the basement.\n\nI opened the basement door and up flew Scout, through the door and into my room. She jumped on the bed and curled up, her ears down, tail tucked. I called for her softly and extended my hand, asking how she got down there in the first place as if she’d actually reply, and she *retreated*. She got up and scurried to the other side of the mattress. Being down there for a bit must’ve spooked her. I had parked my car in the garage and thought maybe I left the door open by mistake. Scout is a curious girl…\n\nBut what would make her act this way toward me? She’s always happy to see me when I get home.\n\nMy head snapped toward the coffee table, to the book.\n\nI went to it, stared at the words, and then snatched it and sat on the couch. I flipped to page ten, a sudden determination overwhelming me.\n\nIt’s just a stupid book! It has no power. I didn’t know how it got back into my house, but I wasn’t going to let it control me. Not anymore.\n\n*How did it come to be?*\n\n*It’s everywhere and nowhere.*\n\n—\n\n*It searches for a being to call its own*\n\n*You’re lost in a land you can’t escape.*\n\n—\n\n\n*A reflection that walks without a mirror.*\n\n*It isn’t you, and yet, it is.*\n\n—\n\n*What it is doesn’t elude you.*\n\n*It could be your neighbors, your family, and your friends.*\n\n—\n\n*It’s closer than you think.*\n\n*It’s here to stay.*\n\n—\n\n*All it needs is your name.*\n\nMy eyes were fixed on the final page, that final sentence that differed from the rest of the book. A single line. Six words.\n\n*All it needs is your name.*\n\nA burst of anger shot through me, and I threw the book. It collided with a wall opposite me, leaving silence, save for my heavy breaths, in its wake.\n\nI paced the room, nails digging into my scalp.\n\n*It’s just a book.* But if I tossed it, it would just come back, right? Like before? What should I have done? What did any of it mean?\n\nScout whined.\n\nI hurried to my bedroom where she was just lying there, whining. I went to pet her, and she retreated again, cowering as if I was some sort of stranger.\n\nThen, the knocking arose again. It was crisp and clear, but it was far enough away that I couldn’t pinpoint where it was coming from until I saw I hadn’t closed the basement door from when Scout ran up.\n\nI walked into the doorway and peered down at the figure in the darkness. It was still, silent, and featureless. It was the first time I had faced it head-on.\n\n“What do you want?” The question was quiet. The fists I balled weren’t.\n\nIt didn’t respond.\n\n“What do you want!” My voice reverberated off the walls. “What do you want! What do you want! What do you want!” Each time, I got louder, more demanding, more desperate. Tears pricked my eyes. “What do you want from me!”\n\n“Alice?”\n\nI whipped around to find my roommate in the living room, a look of pure horror on her face. The moment was short-lived as my stomach hardened at a terrible realization…\n\n*My name.*\n\nI turned back to the foot of the staircase. The figure was gone. I backed away and closed the door slowly, feeling almost manic.\n\n*My name.*\n\n*My name. My name. My name.*\n\nI said nothing to my roommate. I went into my room, shut my door, and climbed into bed, still wearing the jeans and sweatshirt I had on all day.\n\nI suddenly felt defeated, defenseless, worried.\n\nI left my light on. Not the unicorn light–no. The overhead light. I’m so tired. I’m so scared. I’ve never been this scared in my life. Scout’s at the end of the bed. She hasn’t taken her eyes off me. The floorboards have been creaking again, and there was a sound akin to something dragging along a wall.\n\nIt was midnight when the footsteps stopped outside my door.\n\n—\n\n*Ignore the knocking at your door.*\n\n*Keep the light on, and it’ll stay away.*\n\n*You’ll hear a familiar plea and scream and cry.*\n\n*Don’t give in.*\n\n*Don’t search for it.*\n\n*It has already found you.*\n\n*There’s no use hiding.*\n\n*It knows where you are.*\n\n*The day is your friend.*\n\n*For shadows reside only in the dark.*\n\n*Once you let it in, it’ll never leave.*\n\n*Don’t close your eyes; don’t fall asleep.*\n\n*When it has caught you, praying won’t help.*\n\n*You’ll never see the light of day again.*\n\n*There’s nothing you can do to get away.*\n\n*There’s nowhere to go that it won’t follow.*\n\n*The shadow will remain in yours.*\n\n*The closer it creeps, the weaker you’ll become.*\n\n*How did it come to be?*\n\n*It’s everywhere and nowhere.*\n\n*It searches for a being to call its own*\n\n*You’re lost in a land you can’t escape.*\n\n*A reflection that walks without a mirror.*\n\n*It isn’t you, and yet, it is.*\n\n*What it is doesn’t elude you.*\n\n*It could be your neighbors, your family, and your friends.*\n\n*It’s closer than you think.*\n\n*It’s here to stay.*\n\n*All it needs is your name.*",

The last of the monks decided to sell the building for money and the state of Tennessee bought it to make it a heritage site. There is still going to be a library and in addition to adding a bunch of books they are keeping all the ones that were originally here. While renovating the building I found the journal of someone named Ewan. After reading it I found this part particularly fascinating and wanted to share it.\n\nMy name is Ewan and I live in a monastery on the Mississippi river. I have trained under our leader Max since I received a halo.  I was 25. It was 1865.\n\nMuch like 4 years ago our monastery was holding a meeting today. The American civil war had been long and bloody but the south was on the run. They had turned Dixie into an impenetrable fortress and the north was laying siege to it. They were calling for all available troops to gather outside Dixie for an assault.\n\nThe north had gained the upper hand mainly through numbers. Though the south and north had at one point had similar populations the casualties of the 2 changeling crises had changed that. More than 2 thirds of military aged men in the south had been lost too the crises.\n\nOn top of that the north had utilized a new invention to deal with the monstrosities and wendigos. The Gatling gun was remarkably effective on both accounts and had helped the north against Dora’s creations. \n\nThat morning I sat beside the water, praying with my mentor Max. We were both a very calming presence and the animals often came to greet us.\n\n“The orcas will return,” Alziza said from behind us.\n\nI opened my eyes and within moments saw the pod of orcas coming into shore.\n\nMe and Max swam out to the orca pod and before long we were surfing as I had before.\n\nMax spoke loudly as we surfed along the river. “You know in my entire life I have only gone for 29 of these orca rides! How many are you up too child?”\n\n“This is only my third.” I responded playfully.\n\n“Well why don’t we take this opportunity to go over some things! You’ll remember it better because we are surfing I assure you. \n\n“Sure.” I responded.\n\n“Well now.” Max started. “Charlemagne the Great was the first since the fall of Rome to rediscover the phasing power. Do you know who Charlemagne reincarnated as?”\n\n“Napoleon Bonaparte of course” I responded, rolling my eyes.\n\n“He was brilliant!” Max exclaimed. “In a world of traitors the only logical response is personal liberty! Let no one else have control over thee! It’s such a shame Napoleon didn’t practise what he preached. Now then, the watchers! “ Max hacked and spat in water, then paused.\n\n“What about them?” I asked.\n\n“They are a reminder to us all. No matter how powerful you think you are, if you turn against Yahweh, the law of this world will come for you. You have read the book of Enoch, no?” MAx asked.\n\nI looked at the willow trees as we surfed by. “Of course.”\n\n“The watchers thought that Yahweh would come himself to expel them. Instead he sent Enoch. He was the messiah of pre flood earth, much like Jesus christ is our Messiah. Yahweh sent a junior kindergartener to expel an entire grade of 9th graders if you want to think of it like our school.” Max monologed.\n\n“It is said that men lived a up to 1000 years before the deluge. Why did Yahweh shorten our lives so much?” I asked.\n\n“Death can be a blessing down here. People are so evil that it is necessary Yahweh doesn’t give us that much control. If we lived 1000 years there would be men in cages for 900 I tell you. These people are all evil, child. Trust no one fully.” Max monologed.\n\nBefore long we retuned to the monastery and swam to shore. Alziza was waiting for us.\n\n“The tides pull out. We must be ready to ride them to victory.” Alziza said, with death in his eyes.\n\nWe gathered all the monks from the monastery and began our journey to Dixie, rendezvousing with the monks from other monasteries on the way.\n\nBy the time we started seeing gator deer we had a force of 300 monks.\n\nWe arrived at Abraham's Lincoln’s encampment the following day. Just as he had said 4 years ago he had 40,000 troops encircling Dixie. Thus far they had not been able to breach the city, being repelled every time they tried.\n\nAbraham and all his Generals gathered that night to speak with Max. They were plotting a plan of attack when Alziza brought an idea to the table.\n\n“We shall strike at sunrise with all available troops. IT will be a long hard battle, and many of our men will die. But by nightfall we will have the enemy where we want them.” Alziza said ominously.\n\nNo one seemed mentally capable of refuting the wise ass’s points as he scolded the skeptics like children.\n\nEveryone agreed to the plan and we readied to strike at sunrise.\n\nAs sunrise approached I stood with our troop of monks overlooking Dixie.\n\nAll of our artillery was lined up. We had renaissance era cannons with cannon balls and primitive exploding shells. The ones that are just bombs with a timed fuse.\n\nWe started firing upon Dixie as soon as the sun cracked over the horizon. I was not prepared for the horrors that were about to ensue.\n\nMinutes after we started firing, squadrons of giant black wasps came flying out of Dixie in giant V’s.\n\nThe wasps were as big as grizzly bears. They had alligator jaws and wendigo heads on the end of their antenna. Some of their legs were replaced with wendigo arms.\n\nThe mun tried to aim their Gatling guns at them but couldn’t fire high enough. The wasps flew into the groups of men, slaughtering them by the hundreds.\n\nThen a cavalry charged came out of the city. Hundreds of white knights came out riding gator horses. Gator bears and dogs ran at their side. Dora flew above them, riding one of the wasps.\n\n“Allow me to introduce you to my latest creations!” She screamed into the microphone.\n\nWendigos then came running out of the city, gaining on, then passing the white knights as they charged towards us.\n\nI then looked towards the sun, and atop a ridge stood Alziza. He was silhouetted against the sun and stood there like the angel of death, surveying the battlefield. I felt an incredibly strong presence from the spirit world and looked upon Alziza with my third eye.\n\nIn the spirit world Alziza was an alicorn, with wings and a single horn. He led a legion of 200 2 winged angels.\n\nOne of the angels flew over the battlefield and sounded a trumpet. Immediately bullets started curving through the air towards wendigo hearts and klansmen. That battle swung wildly in our favour for a second and then I saw it.\n\nThe red, serpent-like, dragon Saren flying through the spirit world towards Alziza.\n\n“You think you're as powerful as me, jackass?” Saren laughed.\n\nImmediately the remaining 199 angels pulled out weapons and all flew at Saren, attacking him. He laughed as he swatted them away like flies. The battle started swinging in favour of the enemy and I fled to a bush to avoid the carnage.\n\nThe wendigos overran the force I deserted and killed them en masse. Their aim was not true and our side took heavy casualties. The klan was pushing us back and there seemed to be little we could do.\n\nI looked back to the spirit world to see Saren swatting away the last of the 199 angels.\n\n“Now you're mine, jackass!” Saren laughed.\n\nAlziza’s eyes narrowed and he cried out to Yahweh for help. Then from all directions, 20 4 winged angels flew in at a tremendous speed. One of them flew over the battlefield with a goblet of wrath and dumped it. The others gathered around Alziza, and then all flew at Saren, attacking him.\n\nThe battle swung in our favour momentarily as bullets curved towards klansmen, gator things and wendigos. Even a few of the wasps were hit by stray cannon balls. Then everything reversed and our side as being massacred.\n\nI looked back to the spirit world to see Saren crush the last of the 4 winged angels. \n\n“Is that all you got, jackass?” Saren laughed.\n\nI looked to Alziza and saw 7 6 winged angels all clinging to him in the spirit world. They chanted “Glory, glory glory, the lord god the almighty, who was and is and is to come.”\n\nThen all 7 angels along with Alziza flew at Saren attacking him.\n\nThe battle continued for hours. The upper hand going back and forth constantly. I used guerrilla warfare, getting in shots when I could. I had the pistol and cesarion rifle with me, but conserved the ammo as much as I could.\n\nMorning turned to afternoon, and then to evening as the battle raged on.\n\nBodies of both sides littered the ground, tens of thousands were dead in heaps as the battle raged on.\n\nI watched the spirit world as the battle raged. Saren took out the 6 winged angels one by one. As sunset approached the last of the 6 winged angels fell. Alziza was wounded and fell to the ground as Saren laughed.\n\nWendigos sucked men’s blood like mosquitoes, gator bears chomped men in half. Gator dogs yelped with delight as they tore off body parts and swallowed them.\n\nBullets curved towards northerners and our troops were being slaughtered. I watched helplessly as Saren took control of the battlefield. Bolts of lighting started hitting troops on our side as they lost hope.\n\nAlziza cried out to Yahweh, and for a moment I thought his plight fell on deaf ears. Then a number of men came out of the overgrowth, pulling some very advanced looking canons.\n\nIn the spirit world I saw 2 dragon heads floating above the men. The black one I didn’t recognize was smouldering uncontrollably. The other, Yahweh was glowing a profound gold light.\n\n“Saren is too powerful! My lord, I have failed!” Alziza cried.\n\nYahweh looked at Alziza with amusement. “I don’t like to get my hands dirty in these hell worlds.” Yahweh spoke. “I’ll let Nibiru take it from here”\n\nThe black dragon cackled and then teleported beside Saren, flying at the same speed as him.\n\nSaren swatted at him, only for him to appear behind him. Nibiru took a bite out of his back and Saren screamed. Nibiru continued teleporting around, taking bites out of Saren as they fought.\n\nThe battlefield took another turn as the Cesarians opened fire with their advanced cannons. The exploding swerved towards their targets, hitting the wasps and klansmen. These were not primitive exploding shells and detonated on impact. Wasps fell from the sky, burning, klansmen ran, screaming at the tops of their lungs as they burned. \n\nBuildings started bursting into flames and Dixie started to burn. The klansmen ran towards the Cesarians, being mowed down by gatling gun fire. I looked towards Dora’s who seemed humiliated that her creations were being killed.\n\nI looked back to the spirit world and saw Saren and Nibiru duking it out. Saren was on the run as Nibiru chomped away.\n\nSuddenly Nibiru’s head grew a body with legs and he cackled at Saren. A gridded fabric wrapped around Saren leaving him unable to move.\n\n“Please don’t kill me!” Saren cried, unable to struggle.\n\n“Oh you know me Saren. I like to play with my food. I won’t kill you now. I’ll play a game with you. I’ll offer you a chance at redemption, and if you don’t take it, I’ll have Julius Caesar damn you, just like  Yahweh had Enoch damn the watchers. IT seems right since you plan to reach godhood by eating him, no? Now Sarnen, flee to the ends of the earth. Go to the bottom of the ocean, hide behind  the clouds, burying yourself under miles of rock. If you don’t take my offer, there is nowhere I can’t find you Saren. You can’t hide from me.” Nibiru monologed. \n\nThe fabric unravelled and Saren flew away at and incredible speed. Dora fled in the physical world, followed by many of her troops.\n\nAbe Lincoln and the Cesarians seemed focused on a singular task. Burning Dixie to the ground. Cannons fired all night as the city was reduced to total rubble.\n\nMax rallied a small force and we tried to follow the Grand wizard Dora. Tons of her underlings gathered on steamboats that sped off down the river. Dora and her squadron of wasps landing on the boats. \n\nWe could not pursue them and they fled with many klansmen, and monsters.\n\nThe next day me and a force of monks went into the rubble to look for survivors. We found 1 building that was miraculously still standing and we went in to investigate.\n\nThere was a family sitting down for breakfast, all dead.\n\nI looked at them and recognized the family as my own. Grandpa Mike sat at the table along with Christie, Jean Robert, Josephine, someone I didn’t recognize, along with Jeff’s wife, another man I didn’t recognize and Jeff's two kids. All of them sat full of bullet holes around an untouched hog on the table.\n\nAfter Dixie was destroyed what was left of the south surrendered. The grand wizard had fled to who knows where and the south totally surrendered.\n\nThe remaining monks headed back to the monastery and I continued to train under Max for years.\n\nUnfortunately, shortly after the south surrendered we got news of Abraham Lincoln's assassination at the hands of the KKK. Still, the north had won the war and Abe’s people kept his memory alive, and kept the south in check.\n\n5 years passed and in 1870 we located the Grand Wizard. She had fled to Antarctica.\n\nWe mustered a force of northerners who wanted to avenge Abe as well as all the monks we could and sent a convoy of steam ships to head to Antarctica.\n\nMe and Max stayed behind as they left.\n\n“Why aren’t we going with them?” I asked.\n\nMax smiled. “I told you only 7 monk’s in the history of our order have been able to phase through objects, but I have gained the power after that on the chain. The chariot it is called.”\n\nLater that day we got on a steam ship and headed north. Everyone on the ship gathered in the boiler room and prayed as Max activated the chariot.\n\nWe sat in the boiler room for numerous hours while the boat chugged along. When we went back to the deck after a few hours I couldn’t believe my eyes. We had traveled close to 1000 miles in a single day.\n\nThe next day we did the same thing and within two days we reached our destination, Igloolik.\n\n“When I was 8 years old I met a green man by the name of Hugo. He inspired me to be the man I am today. I always knew that one day we would meet again.” Max said.\n\nWe found a group of Eskimo’s and Max asked something in their language.\n\nWe walked along the ice near Igloolik and found something frozen in the ice. While we went to boil some water a monk’s dog named Mutt peed on the ice block.\n\nThe ice block started to shake, and then shattered as a green man stood there screaming. He had teeth like the dragons did and energy swirled around him as he screamed.\n\n“I have come for the white witch!” the green screamed. The ice started cracking around him and for a second I thought we would all be plunged into the freezing water.\n\nHe settled down after a moment and he headed back to the monastery one last time.\n\nI record this here so that my contemporaries, as well as future generations, may have a true account of what happened the night they drove old Dixie down",

        "text": " \n\nI had always been close with my sister, but lately I couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. My sister, Sarah, had always been a bit odd, with her interest in the occult and love for all things dark and mysterious. But lately, I couldn't shake the feeling that Sarah had changed. She seemed more distant, more secretive, and more obsessed with her interests. I tried to brush it off, but I couldn't shake the feeling that something was wrong.\n\nOne night, I woke up to the sound of chanting and followed the noise to the basement, where I found Sarah and Alex performing a satanic ritual. I was horrified and didn't know what to do. I confronted my sister, but Sarah denied everything and convinced me that I was just imagining things. I wanted to believe my sister, but I couldn't shake the feeling that something was wrong.\n\nDays turned into weeks and I couldn't shake off the feeling that something sinister was happening. I started noticing strange symbols etched on the walls, strange smells, and strange noises. I couldn't shake the feeling that I was being watched. I began to suspect that my sister had summoned some kind of demon or spirit, and that it was now possessing her.\n\nI tried to confront my sister again, but Sarah denied everything and convinced me that I was just imagining things. But as the days went on, Sarah's behavior became more erratic and violent. She would lash out at me for no reason, and I began to fear for my own safety. One night, Sarah attacked me in my sleep, and I was forced to flee my own home.\n\nI was terrified and didn't know what to do. I went to the police, but they didn't believe my story. I went to a priest, but he told me that my sister was possessed by a demon and there was nothing he could do. I was desperate and didn't know where to turn. I began to investigate on my own and found out that my sister had been dabbling in black magic and had summoned a demon to do her bidding. The demon had taken possession of my sister's body and was using her to carry out its evil plans.\n\nI was determined to save my sister and stop the demon. I gathered all the information I could and came up with a plan to exorcise the demon from my sister's body. I prepared myself for the ritual, but I knew that it would be dangerous. As I was about to start the ritual, I heard a knock on the door. It was Sarah, but something about her was different, her eyes were black, and she had a sinister grin on her face. She whispered \"I told you, you can't escape from me\" and the story ends with the uncertainty of what is going to happen next.  \n\n\nAs I stood there, staring at my possessed sister, I knew that I had to act fast. I quickly began the ritual, reciting the incantations and performing the necessary actions to exorcise the demon. But as I reached the climax of the ritual, Sarah lunged at me, her eyes filled with rage. I managed to push her back and continue with the ritual, and to my relief, the demon's hold on her body began to weaken.\n\nBut just as the exorcism seemed to be working, the demon unleashed its full fury. The room shook, objects flew off the shelves, and a deep, otherworldly voice filled the air. The demon was not about to give up its host without a fight.\n\nI fought back with everything I had, determined to save my sister. I could see the conflict within Sarah, as if the demon and her were fighting for control of her body. But finally, the demon was vanquished, and Sarah collapsed on the floor, unconscious.\n\nI rushed to her side, relieved that the exorcism had been successful. But as I looked at her, I couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. Sarah had no memory of the demon possessing her, but I couldn't help but wonder if it was truly gone, or if it had left behind some kind of lasting effect.\n\nI stayed by her side, watching her closely for any signs of the demon's return. But as the days passed, Sarah seemed to be back to her old self, and I couldn't help but wonder if it was all just a figment of my imagination.\n\nBut as I lay in bed at night, I couldn't shake the feeling that something was still lurking in the shadows, waiting for the opportunity to strike again. The fear of the unknown, the fear of what the demon might be planning, and the fear of what it might do to my sister, consumed me.\n\nI decided to take matters into my own hands and started researching more about the demon that possessed my sister, I found out that it is known for jumping from host to host and that it takes control of its host's mind, making them do its bidding. I also learned that the demon is extremely powerful and that it is not easy to get rid of it.\n\nI was determined to protect my sister and to ensure that the demon would never harm her again. I began to prepare myself for the possibility of another possession and to be ready to exorcise the demon if it ever came back. But the fear of the unknown, the fear that the demon might come back stronger, and the fear that I might not be able to save my sister, haunted me every day. The story ends with me, the author, sitting in my room, researching and planning for the unknown, but always with the fear that the demon might come back for my sister and for me.",

        "text": " \n\nI'm guessing you don't want to hear about my everyday life so I will just write down the interesting and relevant parts, and for the sake of anonymity I will not mention any names.\n\nThree days ago I woke up in the middle of the night to what sounded like heavy breathing coming from the doorway of my bedroom. Frightened I opened my eyes and looked to where I had heard the noise and I saw what appeared to be a woman. It was too dark for me to get any details of her appearance other than her height and long dark hair, but I could feel her staring straight into my soul. My heart was pounding and I tried to move but I couldn't, no matter how hard I tried I just couldn't. So I did the only thing I could, I stared at her, terrified with an overwhelming feeling of powerlessness. After a few seconds which felt like hours she just disappeared, there was no movement, no sound, one moment she was there and the next she wasn't.\n\nAfter she had disappeared I discovered that I could move again, but I didn't move. I just continued staring at where she had stood for a few minutes. I was terrified but I managed to find enough courage to get out of bed and turn on the lights. My first thought was to search through the house and to call the police because of someone breaking in and watching me sleep, but my second thought was that it wasn't a break in, that it wasn't even real, just a realistic and horrifying nightmare, how else would I explain being unable to move and the woman just disappearing? So I called a close friend of mine. He was annoyed at me calling and waking him up in the middle of the night, but I told him it was important and that he needed to come over so he told me he needed a few minutes to get dressed and that he would be here as soon as possible.\n\nStill scared and waiting for my friend, I opened google to find out if anyone had experienced something similar to what happened to me and I found something called sleep paralysis.\n\nIf you don't know what it is, I´ll give you a summary of what I found out from Wikipedia. It's basically your brain waking up before your body so you find yourself unable to move and when it happens you may hallucinate. \n\nSo while reading I heard someone knocking on the door, I must admit that I was scared when I heard it before remembering that I had asked someone to come over. So I walked downstairs, or rather I ran downstairs scared of the dark and opened the door and invited my friend to come inside. He commented on me being a bit shaky and asked if I was alright and why I had asked him to come over, so I told him what had happened and that I was scared of being alone. To my surprise he didn't ask any follow up questions and he wasn't mad or even annoyed at me, he just offered to stay up with me until the morning and to sleep with me for a day or two if it made me feel safer, I accepted his offer and asked myself what I had done to deserve such amazing friends. After chatting with him for a few minutes we took a mattress and placed it next to my bed so he could sleep there the following night and after that we went to the living room and watched tv until the morning.\n\nFast forward to two days ago, me and my friend had went to bed, he was laying next to me on the mattress we had placed on the floor the previous night and once again I woke up to the sound of heavy breathing but this time it wasn´t coming from the doorway, it was coming from the foot of my bed. As I opened my eyes I saw the same woman from the night before, I tried to move, I tried to scream, and I tried to alert my friend but I couldn't. I looked into the eyes of the woman and even though it was too dark to see any details and even though the only thing I could see in the place where her eyes were supposed to be was darkness I knew that she was staring back at me. Terrified, I didn't dare to break eye contact but then I heard a scream filled with horror, not coming from the woman but from my friend, the woman looked at the source of the noise and then once again she disappeared into thin air and I was able to move. \n\nAs if we had practiced beforehand both me and my friend jumped out of bed at exactly the same time and once I was up on my feet I walked over to the light switch and turned on the lights.\n\nAs soon as the lights were on he asked me something along the lines of what the fuck just happened, so I told him the truth, wich was that I didn't know. He wasn't happy with the answer he got, but it was the only one I had. After some crying from my part and a lot of swearing coming from the both of us we went to the kitchen, grabbed a knife for protection and then once again, I found myself doing some googling to find out what we had just encountered.\n\nAfter maybe 30 minutes I found something interesting, I stumbled across something from some old folklore here in Sweden. It's called a Mara there was a lot of different information and stories about it but something most of them had in common was that there was a woman sitting on your chest making you unable to move and sometimes even killing you, it had not sat on my chest but it did catch my attention since it was a part of Swedish folklore. And if it was a Mara there was a way to get rid of it. When researching it I found a spell to banish it. The only problem was that I was unable to move, much less cast a spell on it, but I had a friend with me who could help me out. So I told my friend what to say if I were to get a visit the next night. We decided to keep the lights on and that he should try to stay awake as long as possible and to try the spell if we got another visit from the woman.\n\nNow fast forward to what happened last night.\n\nUnlike the previous nights I wasn't woken up by the sound of heavy breathing.\n\nI woke up to what felt like 100 kilos on my chest and the awful smell of something rotten, I opened my eyes and saw the woman that had been tormenting me, her face centimeters from mine, and thanks to the light I could now make out some details, and I really wish I couldn't. Her eyes were black as night and her face was that of an old woman, her skin was pale as death and her long black hair was hanging down and it looked like it had never been washed. The rotten smell I had felt was coming from her and I heard the familiar sound of her heavy breathing. The feeling of pure terror was overwhelming and then the woman's mouth opened and with a raspy and low pitched voice she whispered “I'll kill you”. My heart was racing and I could barely breathe due to the pressure on my chest, I have never and I don't think I will ever be as scared as I was then. She slowly raised and moved her hands towards my throat, they were bony and her nails were long and dirty. As she placed her hands around my throat I first felt how cold they were and then she started applying pressure.\n\nAs she was choking me I finally heard it, the voice of my friend, he screamed “Mara Mara memory, in the name of the lord I banish thee, until you have counted all the birds in the sky, all the words of god and all the fish in the sea, in the name of the lord I banish thee”. As soon as he was finished the woman shrieked in pain and lunged at my friend but before she could reach him she disappeared. \n\nNow I'm writing this after drinking 7 cups of coffee, my chest still hurts and I am terrified of going to sleep. My friend is still with me but I'm just praying that she's gone. Every night she has been getting closer and the last time she was on my chest and told me she would kill me, I have no doubt that if the spell didn't work I won't wake up tomorrow.",

        "text": "  PART I: [Something very strange is going on](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/108z58x/something_very_strange_is_going_on/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)\n\nAs I sat there in silence I contemplated what my next steps should be. Just then the lights in the house started flickering violently before dimming down completely and a quiet but steady whirring sound engulfed the silence. I stood up and tried turning the lights off then switching em back on but in vain. The lights remained dim.\n\nI walked back in defeat. As I was about to sit I staggered face first into the couch. I struggled back up and quickly realized what was happening. The entire building had started shaking terribly as if I were in the midst of a level 7 earthquake. I had trouble just keeping myself from falling down. I made my way towards the door pulling it open just as the floor tilted downwards. I toppled down. I tried to crawl my way to the staircase but that was collapsing too. I realized what I should’ve done. I remembered The Disasters 101 class. “In case of an earthquake try seeking shelter underneath a sturdy table to protect yourself from the collapsing debris”. But it was too late. It wouldn’t have helped anyway. The floors were collapsing rapidly so unless the table was going to hold me up like some sort of parachute, I was in a dangerous situation with or without the table. I ran down the stairs but they were caving in pretty quickly. I took a step and fell down two floors on my knees. The pain shot through my legs and I screamed in pain before falling sideways with my head facing up. That was a bad move. I saw the entire floor above collapse entirely and plummet down, about to flatten my entire body….\n\nI woke up to the sound of a train whirring past making a continuous cling clang sound for about half a minute. I shot to my feet and looked around. I was apparently in some sort of a subway station. Except it was the cleanest subway I had ever seen. The lights were bright and the floors were spotless. Some tiles even shone. Oh and one thing! And there was absolutely NO ONE THERE. Not a single soul in sight. ”Gee so unexpected.” I frowned in annoyance. After the train had completely left the station I was met with the same familiar silence. The same sort of suffocating vacuum like silence. But how could that be. Someone must’ve been driving the train. And there has to be someone in it. But there was no point wondering about the train as it was long gone.\n\nThere was only the platform which extended into walls running along the tracks on either side. I couldn’t see a staircase leading up but I did see one leading down to a brightly lit corridor. Having no other options I descended down. I kept walking hoping to see a turn or exit of some sort. But the corridor seemed to last forever. I decided to turn back. As I was walking back I heard the sound of a train arriving. I started running towards the platform. I was in the grip of pure adrenaline rush as I whizzed past the corridor not wanting to miss what might be my only chance of getting out of this place. I ascended up and towards the train as its doors were just about to close. I jumped and put myself between the closing doors and they re opened. I heaved a sigh of relief and sat on one of the emerald green seats. The walls of the trains were pastel yellow in colour and the lights were bright. For a long time all I could see were the black walls of the tunnel that seemed to last forever. I peered out impatiently waiting the tunnel to end. And it did. In MID AIR! The tunnel suddenly opened to a bright view with the wide blue sky above and absolutely nothing for several thousand feet below. I tried to peer at from where the train had emerged and could see that the tunnel was built in the side of a mountain. For a spilt second I thought the train was going to dive down towards the void but it didn’t. It kept moving along on tracks that were built in mid air. There were no bridges or columns supporting the tracks. Absolutely nothing. I was terrified. Up ahead I could see the tracks extending forever with no other mountains or plains for that matter in sight. \n\nI got up and walked towards the doors to the other compartment of the train and entered inside. I don’t know what I had expected. I had given up the hope of being able to see another living being long time back. I kept on walking hoping to reach the front of the train to see who the hell was driving this I-don’t-give-a-fuck-about-physics machine. I wasn’t so sure I wanted to meet the person or creature. But I had to get some sort of explanation. \n\nAs I was heading towards another compartment I heard a voice. A human voice. I stopped in my tracks. \n\n“Why me!!!!!!!” Followed by a whole lot of cursing and panting.\n\nI carefully got down and crawled towards the door. The door was solid metal from hallway down and glass hallway up so I could hide myself pretty well. I slowly peaked over and to my surprise saw a man. Wait a minute…\n\nHe was the exact same man I had seen a while ago in the building of my apartment. The same guy that was being hunted down by a nightmare of a creature. Except he was in a better condition than before. He wasn’t bleeding that was certain. His clothes were ripped but not as much as they were before. I looked down at my own clothes. My jeans were ripped at my knees and my shirt was covered with dirt. My hands arms had few cuts but other than that I wasn’t much harmed.\n\nI looked back up and screamed. He was right there by the glass on the other side staring back at me wide eyed. I scuttled back.\n\n“No wait!” he yelled and opened the door. I was petrified. I had no idea what would happen now. He slowly approached me and started speaking quickly.\n\n“Don’t be scared. I wont hurt you. In fact I’m the victim and I’m pretty sure you are too. “\n\n“Who are you?!”\n\n“How the fuck does that matter?! You gonna run a background check on me?”\n\nI did feel kinda stupid when he commented that. So I asked a question more appropriate for the situation.\n\n“Where are we?”\n\nHe sat down on the train floor cross legged in front of me and said,” Now that I CAN answer….”",

I don’t know how this happened, schizophrenia isn’t contagious. So how could I have gotten it?\n\n(what’s schizophrenia)\n\n(no idea)\n\nI bought myself a cross earlier this morning. It’s a cheap one, about 15 centimeters in length.\n\nAs soon as I grabbed it off the shelf, it began to glow a heavenly glow. Not like the haze that shone on the food of the cafe’; this one was more friendlier and welcoming. This one didn’t offer you food and misery straight after, it offers you protection and refuge; especially from the supernatural.\n\nMy head began to throb and slowly ache – then it began to get worse over the next few seconds.\n\nUlulating screaming erupted from my cranium and through my ears. My head was going to blow off of my shoulders like a watermelon being pummeled by a sledgehammer.\n\nI dropped to my knees, holding my head with the glowing cross in my right hand.\n\nI was literally seeing red as I clenched my teeth to try and stop the pain.\n\nIt was unbearable.\n\n(what the hell is going on)\n\n(i don’t fucking know)\n\n(not ours?)\n\n(yeah im outta here)\n\n(no, don’t you see what is going on? This guy is using a Satandamn cross to push us out)\n\n(fuck that, i don’t want to get burned alive)\n\n(just stay, show this human who’s boss. We didn’t possess a little kid for no reason)\n\n(//////////////////fine///////////////)\n\n(what about the other ones)\n\nThe pain subsided greatly as 11 demons were pulled from my head and into the shelves in front of me.\n\nIt seems they are physical beings as well. The shelves in front of me went flying to the other side of the room.\n\nEvery person in the shop had now fled screaming to their cars.\n\nI looked back in front of me and was pleased to find out that they had all disappeared. I breathed a sigh of relief.\n\n(great, they all dipped)\n\n(it's just me and you smiler)\n\n(shut up. Watch and learn)\n\nSuddenly, my body was moving by itself. I was panicking and trying to scream, but no sound came out.\n\nMy eyes were as blank as eyes drawn on paper.\n\nI found myself stiffly walking to the kitchen section of the store and grabbing a knife off the nearest shelf.\n\nMy hands were working as if they had a mind of their own. They swiftly but efficiently unwrapped the cardboard sheathed on the new knife.\n\nPolice spilled into the doorway and further, blocking the entrance.\n\nI was just trapped inside my own body. I could only watch what was about to unfold in front of me with my own lifeless and blank eyes.\n\n“Alright I am going to need you to step away from where you are hiding with your hands where I can see them”, an officer said.\n\n(pig’s arse)\n\nMy mouth let out a battle cry of a demon as my not-in-control body launched itself on top of a shelf and leaped into the officer.\n\n“What the fu—”, those were his last words before his throat was sliced open.\n\nBlood flew in all directions as my body leapt from side to side, dodging bullets and slitting throats. \n\nThey ended up shooting each other as my possessed body hid behind one officer after another in an attempt to shoot me.\n\nIt was a massacre. None of them were able to request backup.\n\nThe final officer stood in the midst of it all, blood covering his police vest and pants. On the vest, was a name tag matted with blood. The words were still easily able to be read:\n\n**Constable Jeremy**\n\nMy body went limp apart from the legs. The knife dropped to the floor with a clatter, and then my spine jerked up so fast I could have sworn my spine shattered.\n\nI was stuck in my own body yet I couldn’t feel any pain.\n\nAs if on its own, my mouth began to rasp loudly.\n\n(constable Jeremy huh?”)\n\nThen a slightly softer, but ever so hoarse voice replaced the first.\n\n(“put the gun down and we won’t bite”)\n\nOfficer Jeremy was now literally shaking in his boots.\n\n“WH—WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU”, he screamed at me. His words echoed throughout the building almost melodically.\n\nThe first voice was back this time. \n\n(“Jeremy Anthony Amiraz. Father of Bianca Amiraz and lover of Lily Evan Amiraz”)\n\nThe last cop’s eyes went wide.\n\n“How the fu—”. The gun shook wildly in his hands and he began to sob quietly. The shaking gun dropped to the ground. Sliding through the gore on the floor.\n\nI could only watch as the sobs turned to cries of hysteria and grief. Every sound continued to echo throughout the building.\n\n(“that's right. They’re all dead. You have nothing left but this shitty job. Not to mention that you have cancer that’s 4 months old. Oops, did i reveal too much?”)\n\nAgain, my body moved on its own. My head tipped back and began to erupt in hoarse laughter. The noise, just like the sobbing, echoed and boomed all over the building.\n\nI tried to squirm and move about. At least have SOME control over my body, I have to fight it. \n\nMore and more people are going to get hurt by these fucking things.\n\nThe two demonic voices had now merged into one:\n\n(“see what you are? just a miserable human with no life. grovel in the dirt like the worm you ar—”)\n\nIt happened so suddenly my body couldn’t react in time.\n\nThe bullet hit me straight in the stomach and I took a step back, slipping on all the gore before falling to the ground with a wet thud.\n\nA booming laughter erupted from where the cop was.\n\nThe cop was still there. Almost.\n\nJeremy’s body twitched and shuddered as it cackled and laughed, eyes glowing with madness and malice. The gun that was fired was held stiffly in his hand.\n\nWhatever was standing in front of me, clearly wasn’t Constable Jeremy anymore.\n\nThe thing in front of me now, was the possessed body of Jeremy Anthony Amiraz.\n\nThe demons in me spoke first:\n\n(“that was our prey idiot”)\n\nThe possessed body again began to explode with laughter, jerking its body back and forth with every cackle.\n\n**(“go home jinns, you’re done here. You have slain my prey for me, now let me eat”)**\n\nMy teeth clenched by themselves, as if the “jinns” in me were greatly enraged.\n\n(“fuck off. You always have your share at home and we get nothing, now scram before i slit your throat”)\n\nThe hand with my knife in it lifted itself from my side and pointed the bloodied weapon at the demon.\n\nPossessed Jeremy snickered.\n\n**(“look. I have a gun and you only have a kitchen utensil, at any second I can pull the trigger on your head. And we all know what happens to creatures like us when the host is dead”)**\n\nWhat the fuck is happening. Am I seriously watching a fight between 3 demons where 2 are in control of my goddamn body and the other is a cop?\n\nWhatever happens, I don’t want to die like this; Standing in the middle of a supernatural fight. How the fuck did I end up like this.\n\nAnd what about that last officer? If I’m alive when possessed, that means he might be as well.\n\nOne of us has to die here.\n\nBut he just found out he had cancer and he can live his life happily. My life is already fucked up anyway. Cancer is just the flu compared to this.\n\n(“we dont fucking care, asshole. We are still gonna slice you to bits”)\n\nMy body threw itself forward and began to run on its own. My feet were agile and quick as they efficiently slid through the gore on the floor like a speed boat on water, but with running feet to propel.\n\nThe other demon raised the gun and fired 3 shots that echoed throughout the building.\n\nThe first and second bullets whistled past my ear but the third got me in the shoulder.\n\nAs if they felt no pain, the jinns controlling me threw my body into the air and onto the possessed cop.\n\nBlood flew in quick jets as my arm went back and forth stabbing the poor cop in the throat right in front of my eyes.\n\n**(“bastard”) it spat**\n\nBlood pooled all under me as the knife was finally thrust into the body’s chest.\n\n(“get fucked”)\n\nI tried to scream, I tried to warn them but it was already too late.\n\n**(“bang”)**\n\nMy head looked down to see the gun at my stomach, of course the trigger had already been pulled.\n\nJeremy’s eyes rolled back into their sockets, his head fell back; and he died.\n\nI’m writing this as I’m bleeding out. I can finally move my body. The demons in me have probably left me so they could escape without dying. I’m fucked.\n\n**(“they left you here to rot huh. Typical jinns. This body is perfectly fine it just needs some healing”)**\n\nMy eyes shot open. \n\nThis can’t be happening!\n\n**(“time to find those rats”)**\n\nAgain, my body was out of control. It got up and walked over to a dead policeman’s fully loaded gun and picked it up.\n\n**(“my child this isnt the end of you”)**\n\nI stayed silent, not like I can talk anyway\n\n**(“no. this is only the beginning”)**",

        "text": "\n\nNo one noticed the day the sign showed up outside the gas station.\n\n\"This is not a public bus stop. Private coaches only.\"\n\nIt looked professional, but no one was aware of any bus company operating through our town. Nor would anyone expect a bus company to be interested in making a stop here either. \n\nOur town sits in the middle of flat prairies, an hour in either direction from the larger towns along the main highway. The secondary highway that crosses here travels much farther before there are any towns or cities. The only reason this is a town at all is because of our gas station. Our gas station also serves as the local coffee shop, restaurant, grocery store, hardware store and hub of all social gossip.\n\nThe sign was odd, and of course started all manner of local rumors. A new bus line was going to start offloading here, or this was the nearest city planning on installing some tourist attraction. \n\nThe speculation went on for weeks before the first passenger came.\n\nThe passenger was wholly unremarkable. Average height, average weight, wearing a light jacket, jeans, sneakers. This person was so average it could be described as being so vague as to be \"the most useless police description ever\"\n\nThe passenger appeared to be dropped off as though they were a hitch hiker, which was common enough in our town. But instead of heading into the gas station,  they walked over and stood by the bus stop.\n\nWithin 10 minutes a large white motorcoach pulled up, picked up the passenger and drove off. The windows were all tinted, and there were no charter company logos on the bus, so we all just sat back in confusion.\n\n9 days later there were 6 passengers waiting at the stop. All the passengers were dressed very similar to the first, and all of them were equally as unremarkable in description, and all of them were dropped off like hitchhikers or just walked up from out of town. None if them spoke to each other, or did anything beside queue up and wait. Again, within 10 minutes of the last passenger arriving, a non descript white coach pulled up, loaded the passengers, and left. This happened twice more in the following weeks, with more people showing up each time\n\nMy friends and I made wild speculations amongst ourselves as to what was going on. We were young, and had that belief that all 18 year-olds have in their final summer before college; we were invulnerable. Armed with this belief, we agreed that I was going to be the brave hero and get to the bottom of this mystery bus.\n\n7 days later the first of the passengers arrived for the next bus. Showtime.\n\nI grabbed my phone and set it to FaceTime one of my friends from my breast pocket. The volume was silenced for me, but my friends could see and hear everything happening in front of me. I then walked up slowly mimicking the unhurried, yet purposeful pace the passengers usually took. \n\"Excuse me, where is this bus headed?\" With how nervous I felt, it was a miracle my voice didn't crack.\n\nThe passenger ahead of me didn't acknowledge me at all. Turning around, I asked the same question to the passenger that had just queued up behind me. The response was an annoyed and dismissive little shake of the head as if to say,\n\"Don't ask that question. You know better.\"\n\nDespite being such a tiny reaction, the effect was devastating. I felt like a kindergarten child who was just scolded by the teacher in front of the class. I turned back and waited for the bus, nervous, anxious, but no longer willing to disturb the other passengers. \n\nThe bus eventually pulled up. It seemed to be a normal, modern, white, coach. Nothing about the bus seemed immediately ominous other than it was perhaps odd that the windshield was tinted dark enough to obscure one's view of the driver. \n\nWe began to file on. Inside was dark as the windows were not tinted as I had assumed, but were completely blacked out. The driver's compartment was also closed off and no light came in from the windshield.\n The only light was from the interior lights that allowed all the passengers to find a seat and sit down. There was no specific order to where people seemed to sit. Just like a normal bus, people sat wherever, unlike a normal bus though, was what people did when they sat down.\n\nOnce each person sat down, they retrieved a blindfold from the pocket on the seat ahead of them. On each seat there was a large pair of headphones as well. Each passenger dutifully tied on the blindfold then placed the headphones over their ears. I hadn't yet sat down and seriously considered just exiting the bus as the door wasn't yet closed. It seemed like an open invitation, you can choose to sit down, and join in the sensory deprivation, or simply walk off the bus and leave.\n\nI remembered my phone in my breast pocket, and that my friends were watching all of this live. That confidence that gave me was two fold; I had come too far to chicken out now, and if anything got too wild, they could follow and help me.\n\nI chose an empty row of seats and sat near the aisle. The door closed as soon as I sat. I hadn't even realized yet that I was the last person to do so, but the bus didn't move. I looked around to see what the reason might be for the hold up. The bus normally left fairly quickly after loading it's unusually usual group of passengers. Maybe it was because I wasn't wearing the blindfold or headphones yet. I found my blindfold and tied it lightly around my eyes. To my surprise, it was a very thin fabric and I could see through it quite easily. Odd. It was also made even more odd by the fact that the headphones didn't actually inhibit sounds. The whole facade of sensory deprivation was a tricky bit of theater. As soon as I had put the headphones over my ears, the interior lights shut off, and the bus started it's journey.\n\nNow in total darkness, all I could sense was the deep rumble of the diesel engine and the vibration of the road beneath.  Remembering the phone in my pocket I tilted my head down to whisper to my friends,\n\" I hope everyone is enjoying this. This is scary as shit. I can't see anything and no one seems to notice I'm not one of them.\" My whiper was low enough that I could barely hear myself over the engine, but hopefully it was just loud enough to narrate for my friends. The bus drove for some time. I couldn't tell exactly how long in the darkness, maybe 20 minutes, maybe an hour. I could tell that the bus had taken the secondary highway soon after departure, but beyond that I had no clue how far or fast we were traveling.\nTo keep myself occupied, kept trying to look around for any light whatsoever. Nothing. I also narrated some thoughts to my friends and gave updates when I thought the bus might be slowing or turning. \n\nFinally the bus slowed more than usual and made definitive left turn. The paved road sounded like it gave way to gravel or dirt. That lasted only a minute or two before the bus came to a complete stop, and turned off.\n\nNothing happened. Everyone just continued to sit still on the now silent bus. No jostling or stirring of passengers, no snoring or heavy breathing to indicate anyone had fallen asleep. Everyone was just...still.\n\nWith some trepidation, I took the phone out of my pocket to use as a flashlight. \nShit!\nThere was no signal so I hadn't been on FaceTime. No data either. I had no idea how long I was out of communication, and now had no clue if my friends were still tracking me. Stupid, stupid, stupid. Still, my phone would still function perfectly well as a flashlight in the interim.\n\nWith the light on, I removed the blindfold and headphones. I could see everyone sitting patiently, not moving a muscle. Standing up, I stretched my legs a little, cautiously made my way up to the driver's compartment. It was walled off with black plexiglass and gave no clue as to who was driving the bus. In the plexiglass there was a recessed window, but the handle to slide it was apparently on the inside. Turning back I faced one of the seated passengers. I reached out and put my hand on their shoulder,\n\"Excuse me, I know you can hear me. Can you- \"\nThe passenger curtly pushed my hand off their shoulder and grunted a sound of disapproval, much like you would a stranger's child that was being rude or bothersome. It was enough to stop me and make me step back. Once again I felt the childlike dread of having just been scolded.\n\nI shone my light down to the door of the bus. There was no manual door control visible and no emergency handle either. For the first time, I began to let my mind race with dread about my situation. \nRude or not, I had to try something. I faced the little recessed window to the driver and tried to see if it was possible to slide from this side. It slid easier than I expected and opened completely. Looking in, I could see the driver, or what I think was meant to represent the driver.\n\nThe awkward shadows cast by my phone's light showed what appeared to be a mannequin in the driver's seat. I got my face closer to the window to get a clearer view when the mannequin's head swiveled to face me. The movement was enough to make jump back, but the face was wrong as well. \n\nThe face of the mannequin had semi realistically painted eyes, but the rest of the face gave the impression that a young child was given a make-up kit and told to finish the face. The mouth was down on the chin the nose was off-center, and the shading gave the illusion that the whole head was deformed. The shock of the head moving and the distorted face made me jump backfill across the lap of the nearest passenger into the empty seat beside them. \n\nIn a panic, I pulled off the headphones and blindfold of the passenger, \n\n\" Hey! Hey! Please, help me get off! I need off of this bus!\" I shouted, starting to lose control.\n\nThe passenger threw their hands over their face and began sobbing. It grew in intensity. Louder and louder, more animated untl the passenger was bawling wildly. Their hands clutched at their head and rubbed their eyes as they continued to bawl. I could finally hear more movement from the rest of the bus as well. More passengers were now removing their own blindfolds and headphones. As they did, they too, began to wail, sob and cry. The bus was soon a deafening cacophony of sobs and wails. I was panicking now trying move myself away from the hysterical passengers. I pushed across the passenger whom I had fallen over, and tried to stand back up next to the driver's door again. In a fit of wailing, the passenger had struck me while trying to clutch at their head.\n\nInstinct took over in that instant and I punched at the passenger, glancing a blow across their brow with my free hand. Immediately the passenger changed from crying and wailing to screaming. As soon as the first passenger began screaming, all others began to scream as well. An emotionless, piercing, ear-splitting blast of sound coming from every direction.\n\nIt was as if every passenger had been filled with screams their entire life and it was all being forced out as fast as it could. I was taken by my own screams of terror and disorientation as all around me the passengers lost their minds to the screams.\n I punched my arm into the driver's compartment and began wildly flailing at controls hoping to open the door. My panic and fear were reaching a breaking point at which I thought I might lose a level of sanity I could never recover. \nFinally a small hiss could be heard under the insanity that echoed around the bus, and the door swung open. I jumped at the now open door with only a very dim light shining in. As I jumped I also fell in my mindless bid to escape. When my hands and knees hit the dirt under the bus to signal my body that I was free of the bus, the screaming stopped. Every passenger seemed to finally exhaust their screams at that exact instant.\nSilence.\nThe silence was worse. I Was frantically crawling, trying to get away from the door of the bus  the door that opened onto the insanity of those...passengers. then another hiss.\nThe door swung shut. The bus now seemed inert. No sounds, no movement. Nothing.\n\nIn the instant it took me to scramble away from that bus, it dawned on me that it wasn't the dark of the afternoon, we were in a building. Wide eyed and still breathing deep panicky breaths, I noticed were in a dirt floored barn. Sunlight outlined a door just 20 feet away. I clutched my phone tightly in my hand as I stood and raced to the door. A deep fear boiled in me telling me that the door was locked. Luckily that just a bad thought and the crash bar of the door gave way and flung open the unlocked door.\n\nThe light blasted across me, blinding as I burst out of the barn. I was free. Out of the bus, out of the barn, away from the passengers. Away. I saw the driveway the bus had taken to get into the barn and ran back along until I saw the highway. I didn't stop running until I was at the highway, and only then I only slowed to a brisk, worried walk constantly looking back to be sure the barn and the bus it contained stayed where it was and kept itself inert.\n\nI managed to get a weak signal on the phone and called my friends immediately to come find me. I turned right onto the highway and began walking, hoping to see another car or hopefully my friends as I aimed for the town. Aimed for home.",

To move in I spend easily over $15,000.\n\nIn exchange for (J) would pay $1800 and (S) $1567, leaving to my own rent cost about $700 directly and having the bigger room for me and (T)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut after (S) first started having some troubles paying rent, suddenly (J) attitude worsen, manipulations were becoming clearer,\n\nespecially when we realized he was instigating everyone to fight with each other. \n\n(S) caught up his rent, but (J) then fell behind, stayed behind, and strangely would speak about it as I was culpable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI very politely asked to communicate in text for better record keeping for myself (actually due his lying) \n\nand he richly accused me of trying to trap him saying something he shouldn't.\n\nHe started saying to (GF), (S) and other people that I had tricked him, force him to move in,\n\nand broke my promise to let him live in the room I airbnb in South Beach. He said he wasn't making money because of this reason,\n\nthat it was my fault he was behind rent. He started patronizing me, as in I don't understand how working really is, that I'm child-like. \n\nTo pacify him, and with  great hope he starts making money, he pays his late rent and \"HAKUNA MATATA\" -I said he could go to South Beach\n\nfor a few nights in  two weeks when there is an opening.\n\nHe starts talking and messaging me that he is moving there to my surprise.\n\nWell he packs all his stuff from my Duplex and goes to my Airbnb. \n\nThen he left my place in South beach and went somewhere else, I do not know where.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBy now I had invited a friend to stay in my duplex, the bedroom (J) had vacated.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward to the 25th of November (rent is due in the 1st), I contact him about finishing paying me back: $300 from Nov. rent, \n\n$20 he had kept from me, and another $400 he owed the third roommate (S), that wasn't in the lease, yet I cared for my friend (S).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe doesn't pay a penny, insults, blames me, I tell him to please stay gone then, I would forgive and pay his debts here. \n\nHe had taken all his stuff already from my home and I had a friend sleeping here occupying th bedroom he moved out of. \n\nIf he left anything in my other place in South Beach he could contact (R) that lives there to pick his stuff\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf he returned to my duplex, I wouldn't stop him entering as I knew legally I couldn't. But I have already another friend sleeping in the room and he would have to kick them out legally.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe responded saying I am illegally evicting him over over $20 dollars, but he be happy to stay gone, if I pay him $2,588 otherwise,\n\nhe would return and make my life hell, among the written threats, he would enter the house and change the locks, lose everything, get me evicted from south beach, evicted from my home, loose my income\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nalso in phone calls he threaten physically a lot including to attack me while sleeping.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI said I won't be subject to blackmail and we stop having contact.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't hear of him again, but I saw him drive by a couple times and look at the house driving by or in a park park car. \n\nhe would leave when he knew I saw him with certainty. Happened predictably when I would turn my bedroom light on at night,\n\nand I became visible to him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe called the police to my front door, He ask about Jai, and I had to tell the police everything about the situation, \n\npolice told me (J) story's is completely different, but he said I could go home, I went back inside and from my bedroom window. \n\nI noticed Jai with luggage walking towards my house, talk to the police by the side walk a few minutes then both leave.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe is now saying, he had a police escort him inside the duplex to collect his stuff, and that he was illegally evicted. \n\nHe also reported me and the city and they send investigators for doing illegal vacation rentals in my Duplex and in South Beach.\n\nHe has emailed the landlord demanding them to evict me, so he could move in my home! Sleep in my bed, eat my food, use my TV. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOver a month later he eventually does enter through the front door during the day, and sits in my couch along with a Husky.\n\nHe essentially claims I had locked him out and to avoid troubles for myself, He will live here in my home again, he will not pay back his debts to me, \n\nAlso would keep 1/3 of deposit and he will now get to pick which bedroom is his own, and my bathroom is now his bathroom.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis day and night I was very afraid, (GF) had called the police and they said they would not get involved. \n\nHe recorded me through hours to gather evidence to harm me somehow and I felt powerless to do anything besides sit by the stairs to my bedroom for 5 maybe 7 hours.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI obtained luckily a 6 minute video that he recorded of me, when he started this recording, like many others it was secretly. \n\nIt starts' when I was alone with him, and he said I couldn't stop him going upstairs and he was going to \"his\" room.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI started panicking and was going up the stairs saying \"don't go near me\", but i was going up to lock myself in my bedroom had he come closer. He realized it, then focused the camera on me -\n\nthat's when I noticed he was recording me and that made me feel safe.\n\nNow his plan is  to record me and paint me unhinged, since he realized I was never going to get physical.\n\nSo I vented over 5 minutes saying what I think of him, he didn't deny when I accused him of owing money too a whole lot of people and fooling them. He responded that has nothing to do with us. He finally stop recording, when he got caught off guard, as I reminded of my fear of him and his multiple threats to beat me up, he uncomfortably argues, all he said was that I deserve it, as in I deserve to be beaten up by him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLater (S) talks to him gently and we compromise on him sleeping in the couch or the bedroom downstairs, but he had to stop harassing us and his debts and rent price we would discussed tomorrow.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI offered him a plate of food and he slept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe leaves next morning without saying anything. Then his lawyer messages me, and now I am told I have to pay him a settlement\n\nOtherwise he wont leave the lease, nor anyone else could without his signature. (G) wants to sign off\n\nHe will not allow anyone to join the lease to have me help pay rent. (GF) and (S) want to sign in.\n\nLandlord thus will be force to evict me for having (GF) and (S) live here without being added to the lease.\n\nAlso he mentions they have proof of drugs in the Duplex\n\n(S) had the brilliant idea to make a joint in front of him while being recorded, as a flex \"do your worse (J)\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLandlord expects me to solve everything and I am just now seeking legal help.",

        "text": "So before I even bother trying to explain what's happening to me right now, I need to give some background. \n\nThis happened about two years ago. I was in my room cleaning and listening to music. It was nighttime and I casually looked put the window of my room, I can't say I remember as to why as it was two years ago. But for whatever reason I did. \n\nNow it's important to note that my house is in a complex area. So there's generally a row of about seven identical houses connected to one other in a line. Same goes for the houses in fronts and behind us. Meaning we share a backyard with the people behind us and a street with the houses in front of us. My window faces the back of the house so I have a clear view of the backyard and backside of the houses behind us. \n\nAs I was looking out I noticed one of the windows from the other side of the yard. It was on the top floor and the lights were on. But the room seemed empty, now I don't know if that's true because I mean it was just a quick glance and there's only so much I could see from where I was. Just as I was about to turn around and go back to what I was doing something caught my eye. There was a person in the room now. The figure from what I remember had long dark hair and and tan skin. I don't remember what she was wearing as again it was fairly far from where I was. The thing I do remember was she didn't have a face. She just didn't. It look was just an empty canvas of tan skin. I thought this was odd, because even from that far away I should've still been able to make out small distinctions. But I couldn't. \n\nAnyways once I noticed her I stood there for a moment, not really thinking much of it. I think I remember having the passing thought of \"oh that's weird I totally didn't see her there before\" . \n\nAs I stood there just kind of looking at her, I realized that she was looking at me too, or just facing my direction. I couldn't help but notice how odd she looked. She was standing in this  incredibly and perfectly still position. Her arms hanging by her side and her shoulders perfectly broad. Something about it was just so uncanny. \n\nAt this point we had been standing there for I don't know how long. Felt like ten minutes at least. Then she abruptly stepped away from the window and sat down on something. Her head still completely turned to face my direction. There was a moment of pause. Then she sporadically started to sit up and down off the bed. Still facing me. Just over over and over again. But at incredibly speeds. It looked like she was a video and some one had sped up the film. It just looked odd. In humane. \n\nAt this point I'm looking out the window and thinking. What. The . Fuck. Is this girl doing? \n\nI think I was a little bit creeper out by that point. But I brushed it off. Maybe she'd seen me staring and was just messing around trying to be funny. \n\nThen she stopped. She was standing again. Still facing me. Then she got up real close to the window. And just started waving her arms and moving up and down. Again I still thought she was just trying to mess with me, when I realized how deranged she was moving. How her limbs were bending in ways they weren't supposed too. The way it seemed like her joints were slowly becoming unhinged from there sockets. \n\nAt this point I was mega creeped out. I didn't know if I was hullincatieng or if I was just imaging that she was acting so weird. So I just decided to go back to what I was doing.\n\nI'll be honest I don't remember what happened that night. \n\nBut what I do know, is that the people who live there? Don't have a daughter. It's just the two of them. Sure the girl I saw might be the lady who lives there with her husband. But the girl I saw seemed young. \n\n\nAnyways, that was two years ago. And I just brushed it off as some weird thing that happened to me and I haven't thought much of it. I had completely forgotten about it till just now. \n\n\nAgain,I was in my room. Doing something. And casually glanced over at the houses across the yard. Across from me, there was room, seemingly empty, for the most part. In the right hand corner, there was girl her head awkwardly crooked to be looking my direction. Can't see her body. You know in cartoons when the character can peer around a corner with just there heads? Yeah. That's what she's doing. \n\nAs soon as I saw I immediately picked up my phone and started writing this down. I needed to tell someone. And I was curious to see of anyone has had this happen to them. \n\n\nAfter I wrote that last little bit. I got up and looked out the window again. She's still there. Except this time there's something else in there with her. I don't know if it's a person, object, entity, whatever. But it wasn't there before. \n\n\nI don't know what to do. Has anyone had this happen before??",

        "text": "Every day I lived life under an umbrella of fear. Each breath was filled with paranoia, and nothing I did ever fixed it.\n\nI used to have hope. I used to think that \\**someday\\*,* all would be well. But no. It only got worse, and then it twisted into something else entirely. Something… terrifying.\n\nOn any other anxiety-encompassing day, I heard an odd noise. Usually, odd noises were a thing of regularity. I heard them often—a whisper from empty air or someone calling my name despite being alone. But this noise was different; it was a little \\**snap\\** right next to my ear as if someone was trying to get my attention with their fingers.\n\nAs you might expect, I turned my head, but nothing was there. And that was it for the rest of the day—one snap and then silence.\n\nNaturally, I spent the whole time riddled with anxiety—second-guessing every decision and trembling like a thin tree in a hurricane.\n\nThe next day, I stared at myself in the mirror, cursing my existence. Suddenly, I saw a dark object in the mirror's reflection disappearing behind my shower curtain. Once again, it wasn't uncommon for me to imagine things in the throes of horrible mental dilapidation, but I still always entertained the oddities in case they were real, and I was in danger.\n\nWell, I pulled the curtain back to see an empty tub. Go figure. But while I was poking my head into the shower, I heard the snap. This time, it was behind me, and when I spun around, I saw a hulking black mass in the mirror's reflection.\n\nI faced the shower again to see nothing. And when I looked into the mirror, it was just my wretched face staring back at me.\n\nSeeing things was a sure sign of sleep deprivation, but it wasn't the first time I had seen something unexplainable. However, a welcomed wave of sleep suddenly came over me, and I stumbled out of the bathroom towards my room.\n\nMy balance was off, and my feet struggled to keep flat against the wooden floor. It had been a long time since I'd felt this type of exhaustion. I enjoyed it immensely.\n\nBut as I lifted my heavy head, I beheld a pale figure standing at my bedroom doorway. It was facing into the room, and I sensed terrible dread flowing off it. I stopped in my tracks only for it to walk through the doorway, out of sight.\n\nI tried to sneak up to my room, but the floorboards were old, and every time my weight came down, they creaked. Despite having seen eerie things before, they had never felt this real or this evil.\n\nPeering around the corner of the doorframe, I saw the figure standing in front of my bedroom window. It was staring out into the night, but what it was looking at was a mystery because I lived in a rural area.\n\nIt wasn't moving, or rather, it was difficult to distinguish it from a person or a mannequin. But a deeply-rooted instinct within me protested fiercely against approaching it, and for once in my life, I listened. I remained in the doorway, gazing fearfully at the strange figure.\n\nI watched it for quite some time before I realized I had forgotten to blink. As my eyes did their natural action, I opened them to see the figure had moved closer.\n\nWhatever it was hadn't turned around, nor did it make any noise, though it was as if it simply walked backward toward me. However, the speed at which it moved was concerning because it was much closer after blinking a second time.\n\nIt was within arms reach, yet I dared not touch it. I watched intently for any sign of breathing, but there was none. My legs began to tremble as I sensed the oncoming blink. What would happen if it reached me? Would it take its elongated, knife-like fingers and rake them across my face? Would it put me out of my misery? At least then, I wouldn't have to deal with it any longer.\n\nStill, something in me fought the urge to blink. I clung to life against my best wishes and kept my eyes open. Suddenly, I heard a resounding \\**snap\\** behind me, and I instinctively turned to see my darkened hallway.\n\n\\**Shit!\\** I said to myself as I cranked my head around to look into my bedroom.\n\nThe figure was gone. And the last thing I remembered was the floor rushing at me as I collapsed from fatigue.\n\nThat next day, I woke with my face burning. I had landed on a loose floorboard that I had been putting off fixing. Unfortunately, I must have come down right on it because a painful puncture wound was in my cheek.\n\nI crawled to my feet and gently touched my face. It was swollen and sore, and a trail of dried blood streamed down my neck. Luckily, I never had visitors, and I didn't seek them out, so no one would see me.\n\nI hated my face anyway.\n\nMistakenly, I fell backward on the bed and hit my head on my laptop. \"Ow, fuck!\" I said aloud.\n\nSuddenly, from down the hall, I heard a snap. \"Is someone there?!\" I called out. The snapping continued, like someone trying to carry a tune.\n\nI almost lost consciousness when I stood up. One of my biggest problems was neglecting my health. I rarely ate. You could say I felt weak, but that would be an understatement.\n\nThe snapping went on and on to the point of madness. Each snap caused me to flinch, and the longer it rang down my hall, the more I wanted to claw my face off. I had an excruciating sunburn once described as \"Hell's Itch\" by doctors; it felt like a demon was embedding its sharp claws in my back. But even that didn't compare to the snapping's effect on me.\n\nReluctantly, I walked toward my bathroom—the source of the snapping. As I rounded the corner of the bathroom door frame, it stopped. \"What is going on?\" I asked aloud as I stared down at the dirty-white tile floor.\n\nThen a knock came on my front door. It wasn't a gentle knock but one of urgency. \n\nHowever, as I said, I never had visitors.\n\nI meandered through my house to the front door, swearing I had caught glimpses of things in the corners of my eyes. I felt like something that wished to harm me was watching.\n\nBut my mind kept reassuring me, stating it was all a hallucination—a product of my anxiety.\n\nI pressed my punctured cheek against the door as I stared through the peephole, wincing. Standing on the other side of the door was a woman. I didn't recognize her, but she seemed… genuine.\n\nI opened the door without thinking, and she brushed her way inside, completely silent. \"Excuse me, can I help you? People don't normally go walking into strangers' houses,\" I said, leaving the door wide open.\n\nThe woman, wearing a plaid petticoat, sniffed the air before facing me. \"It reeks of desperation in here,\" she said, piercing me with her deeply disconcerting eyes.\n\n\"Are you lost?\" I asked, narrowing my gaze.\n\n\"I think I'm exactly where I need to be,\" she said with a debutante flair.\n\n\"I don't know who you are, and I want you to leave my home right this second,\" I said, gesturing toward my door.\n\n\"You'll never be rid of me, so there's no point in my leaving.\" Her wrinkled face began to relax frighteningly; it was falling away from her skull.\n\n\"Wh-what's wrong with your face? Leave, now!\" I said, trying to usher her out of my home.\n\nThen the pale figure from the night before appeared behind her and gripped the underside of her chin. She smiled as it pulled the flesh of her face over her head.\n\nI screamed like a child and ran out the door.\n\nHalfway down the road, I began questioning what I was doing. Why was I running away from something that was not even real? \"You're a moron!\" I said to myself as I turned around and headed back home.\n\nI walked through my wide-open front door and softly closed it behind me. As expected, the woman and the figure were gone. More paranoia-driven hallucinations that I used to be desperate to escape from, but since having gone through years of trial and error, I decided to let any strange happenings go.\n\nBut then, I wondered: if it \\**wasn't\\** real, why was there a petticoat on the shoe matt next to the door?\n\nI threw it outside and went to the bathroom. My mirror had a web of cracks—something I couldn't remember happening. Staring at myself was always a struggle because I hated my appearance. I mentioned that before. But as I looked at myself then, I couldn't recognize who I was.\n\nWhy were my eyes so dark and heavy? I knew I didn't sleep well the night before, but I looked like death.\n\n\\**Snap\\*.*\n\nAfter the last \"hallucination,\" I felt it was unbecoming of me to inquire into anything else that might arise around me. However, it was difficult to ignore the beastly man draped over my shoulders in the mirror. I couldn't feel his weight, but he was there, staring at me with dead eyes.\n\nWhen I reached to touch his arm, I only felt my shoulder. Was the mirror somehow a window to another world? It had to be, right? \n\nThe man pulled the loose skin on my face. It was like the woman with the pale figure, yet he wasn't even there. It was like watching a horror movie starring me.\n\n\\**Snap\\*.*\n\nHe disappeared. Was the snap a trigger of some kind?\n\nMy anxiety was peaking, reaching the point of involuntary retching. I needed medicine. I always kept it in my bedroom, inside a little end table. But when I checked the drawer, it was gone.\n\nI took a deep breath, trying to calm myself. Sometimes things get misplaced, but that's no reason to hit the ceiling. However, because I was already positively buzzing from all the angry butterflies in my stomach, I panicked.\n\nTossing the room, I couldn't find the pills anywhere. I checked throughout the house to no avail. Every so often, my search would be halted by a faint \\**snap\\**, and I'd turn my head to see nothing but open air.\n\n\"Fuck! Where are they?!\" I asked aloud, eyes nearly bulging out of my head.\n\n\\**Ding-dong\\**…\n\n\\**The doorbell? Wait… I don't have a doorbell.\\** I thought, swallowing a dry lump in my throat.\n\n\\**Ding-dong, ding-dong, ding-dong!\\** The phantom doorbell rang over and over; someone was impatient. But who?\n\nWhy was I even wondering such things? I didn't have a fucking doorbell. \"It's not real! These are all just figments of my imagination!\" I shouted into the hallway.\n\n\"Are they now?\" asked a malignant voice from behind me. Then, an emaciated hand fell on my shoulder, gripping it tightly. \"What makes you think any of this \\**isn't\\** real?\"\n\nI slowly turned my head to see a decaying grin. Then it vanished, and the piercing doorbell stopped with it. \"I'm losing my fucking mind!\" I said aloud. \"Where are those fucking pills?!\"\n\nBack on the hunt. I scoured my entire house from floor to ceiling. All I could find was dust, some coins, and a briefcase I couldn’t remember owning. This must have been what people called the \"downward spiral,\" as I was clearly tumbling into insanity.\n\nAnd with night returning, worry set in. Who was the pale figure, and what did it want? Would it revisit me? I had gone through withdrawals before, but what I was experiencing then felt like a new level. It was as if my deranged mind was inviting evil into my home.\n\nI sat by the window in my worn armchair, staring out at a swiftly darkening sky. But I wasn't alone. I'm not sure how I knew, I just did. Something was in the room with me, siphoning my energy like an emotional leech. However, I was too afraid to look around. You know that feeling you get as a child when there's an expansive room behind you, and you imagine something sneaking up to snatch your soul?\n\nI felt that only it was as real as someone prying my eyes open to see the danger as it approached.\n\n\\**Snap\\*.*\n\n\"I'm not listening…\" I said, covering my ears.\n\nThe room dropped dramatically in temperature, and a shadow crept in around me. The doorbell, or rather, the one I didn't have, started ringing again. I mustered my courage and stood up, rushing to the front door. Perhaps I'd somehow catch someone playing a prank on me?\n\nDespite feeling like I was under the thumb of something sinister, my room was empty. But, while on my way to the front door, I saw glimpses of shadows lurking in my peripheral vision. The doorbell continued to ring—each little \\**ding-dong\\** felt like a nail being driven into my skull.\n\nI flung the door open, but no one stood before me. A loud, droning hum erupted behind me, one that drowned my thoughts. Suddenly, something grabbed my ankle tight like a vice.\n\nAt my feet was a torso. It wasn't someone I recognized, but its empty sockets were staring right up at me. The corpse opened its toothless mouth and groaned. Then its grip tightened further; it felt like my leg was going to break.\n\nWith my free foot, I stomped on its head until it was a mushy mass under my bare feet. Then Knocking began all around me—the house started to shake. \"What is happening?!\" I shouted, squeezing the sides of my head.\n\nI ran to the bathroom. For some reason, I felt it was the last bastion of defense. The door slammed on my finger as I closed it, causing tremendous amounts of pain. And when I stared in the mirror, my face looked like a mottled plague victim. Holes were laden throughout, and my skin was rotting away.\n\nWas I dying? How could someone lose their mind this badly? I had only been without medication for a \\**day\\*,* and none of it was to keep a stable mental state. So why was I hallucinating?\n\n\\**Was\\** I hallucinating?\n\nMy heart skipped as I saw an outline protruding from my shower curtain. \"I-is someone in there?...\" I asked, pressing my lower back against the sink.\n\nThe curtain wavered, and the house calmed into a settling silence. For the first time in many years, my head was devoid of thought. Curiosity replaced fear as I drew the curtain back.\n\nThere was nothing behind it. And at that moment, I thought all the terror I had been experiencing was just my shattered imagination. I sighed, turned to leave, gripped the tarnished-brass doorknob, and wrenched it.\n\nIt was locked, despite not being able to be. Faint cackling came from behind me, near the shower. The curtain was closed again, and the outline returned. I tried turning the knob harder, but no luck; it was tighter than a bolt sealed by thirty years of rust.\n\nNails scraping against polyester arose in the bathroom. I rammed my shoulder into the door, but it wouldn't budge. I tried again and again. However, I'd sooner break a bone than the door.\n\nThe metal shower rings holding the curtain rattled, and I reluctantly craned my neck to face it. The tube light in the ceiling buzzed incessantly, flickering frequently. My heart thumped intensely as if each beat was someone punching me straight in the chest.\n\nAt that moment, the moment a decomposing hand emerged from behind the curtain, I realized I wasn't simply hallucinating. When the disheveled corpse shambled out of my shower and crept toward me, bits of flesh fell to the tile with a faint \\**plop\\**, and my skin crawled.\n\nI reached behind to grip the knob again, but it was no use. I was trapped, alone, and afraid. The waterlogged entity groaned as hollow breaths filled its lungs; its body was held together by only a few thin ligaments.\n\nThe snaps returned---a chorus of disembodied fingers clicking until I was forced to cradle my head in my hands. There was a terrible heaviness in the air as the corpse continued to approach; it was quickly within arms reach, and there was nothing I could do to stop it.\n\nSuddenly, my door fell off its hinges, and I tripped backward onto the floor. Staring down at me was the pale figure; its sunken, empty eyes bore horrific malice.\n\nI crawled as fast as my four limbs would let me straight to my bedroom. Immediately, I barricaded the door with my dresser and closed the curtains. \"Leave me alone!\" I shouted as whatever was pursuing me began to hammer against the door.\n\nThen, like a miracle from God, my bottle of pills rolled out from under the dresser. And like a starving animal, I pounced on it, twisted off the cap, and popped three in my mouth. I lay on the floor, listening to the obnoxious pounding and clawing on the other side of my door.\n\n\\**When will it end?\\** I wondered as my heart thumped off-beat.\n\n*\\*This will save me\\**. I told myself, breathing like I was having an asthma attack.\n\nAn hour went by before I noticed the sounds had dissipated. The low hum of warm air passing through air ducts kicked in and filled my home. I stared up at the ceiling, finally at peace.\n\nAfter another half an hour, I got up and sat on the edge of my bed. Who would I talk to about this shattered mind of mine? Who could help me prevent this from happening again? The whole thought process wracked my brain so harshly, I started overheating, almost as if it was actually frying.\n\nSo, I went to my window and drew the curtains back to open the latch.\n\nBut staring in at me was my mother and father. They smiled through the glass before attacking each other. They ate at their faces—teeth and all.\n\nI rushed back to the door, still barricaded by my dresser, only for the head-quaking noises to resume, more cacophonous than ever.\n\nI've tried making phone calls, but the line never connects. I can't go through the window because my parents are still standing out there, their faces torn to shreds. And I'm not strong enough to challenge whatever is desperately trying to get in.\n\nI've been rocking myself in the fetal position in an unlit corner. I can’t sleep. Not for the last two days. The noises never stop. And now the pale figure has appeared in my room. It’s standing near the window, but I know if I get distracted for too long or fall asleep, it'll move closer.\n\nNever doubt the power of the mind. I'm living proof of the ability to manifest evil from imagination alone, and I am suffering for it. My sick mind will be my death unless I receive another miracle, but I've never been so lucky.\n\nMy parents just broke the window, and the man moved closer. It's so cold, and I just want it to end.\n\nThey're coming for me.\n\nThe pills aren't helping.\n\nThis is real.\n\nBe careful what you wish for—you might just get it.\n\nDeath approaches. Farewell.",

It seemed to staple the heavens to the earth, impaling the starry night sky.\n\nIt only appeared at night, and even then, nobody was sure when that night would come. It was always once a month, always after the sun had completely set, and always appeared for three nights in a row; but the specific time and date of its appearance seemed to be random. Perhaps it operated on a different time scale than ours.\n\nI was born in that small Colorado town and lived there until I was 13. Never once did I hear anyone question what the Spire was or why it came. All I knew was that on nights when it was seen, word spread quickly to lock doors and windows, stay inside, and keep quiet. In my own house, I was always told to keep the curtains drawn and to not look out the window.\n\nOne crisp autumn night in September, I struggled to sleep. I must've been about 7 years old at the time.\n\nI tossed and turned for a few hours, watching my bedside clock as the minutes ticked by. 12 AM, 1 AM, 2, and then 3. At 4 in the morning, I sat up, unable to take the tedium any longer. I left my bed and went to the window. Filled with trepidation, I cautiously slipped my fingers between the curtains, and peeked through the gap.\n\nI still remember it vividly.\n\nA huge full moon shone directly at my bedroom. It was haunting, but more haunting still was the thing which stood before it.\n\nOut past the edge of town, I saw the enormous, needle-shaped silhouette of the Spire.\n\nIt rose from the Earth like a stalagmite, and seemed to spear into the moon, as though it were the tine of a fork penetrating the white of a boiled egg.\n\nAnd paired with this daunting sight was a sound. The faintest sound of a song.\n\nThough I don't remember its tune, I remember the way I felt as I heard it. It was like a gentle tenor voice crooning a soft lullaby. It was deeply melancholy, mournful, regretful. As I heard it, I was filled with a deep and impending dread. My mortality was suddenly apparent, and it felt so very near.\n\nI was only 7, but as I heard the quiet serenade, I was overwhelmed by the feeling that my death was fast approaching.\n\nOut of pure fear, I let the curtain fall closed and dashed back to my bed. As I draped my blanket around my shoulders, I realized I could no longer hear the song.\n\nAs the uneasiness left my body, I finally drifted off to sleep, but my dreams were to be far more disturbing than reality.\n\nI woke up - or at least, thought I woke up - gazing upward at a starry sky, which was colored a deep purple. I sat up, finding myself in a meadow, dimly lit by the multiple moons that filled the heavens.\n\nAs I took in my surroundings, I once again heard the song from the window. It was being sung by a dark-haired woman who sat with her back to me. I was again filled with mortal terror, but in spite of myself, I called out to the woman, who abruptly stopped singing and turned to me.\n\nSuddenly, something about her changed... she became... different. It was as though she was simultaneously near to and far from me. She shifted, and I got the impression that she was turning her featureless face toward me. My surroundings dropped away and the amaranth sky was replaced by a feeling as though I were surrounded by a thick sludge which prevented me from moving.\n\nEverything faded into nothing more than a feeling... I felt the faceless woman merge with the sludge... she became the environment which I found myself in...\n\nShe was around and in me, consuming my mind. I heard many thoughts which I can no longer remember. Thoughts filled with anger, hatred, and longing. Above all, I felt a sense of time, as if I were remembering something ancient.\n\nI abruptly awoke, staring directly out my window. I lay in bed, but my curtains were open. Through the window, I saw a silhouette, backlit by the moon, with luminous round eyes staring directly into mine... I knew that it saw me. I knew that it knew I saw it.\n\nI heard the sound of chimes...\n\nAnd suddenly, I was waking up again, light seeping in through the gap in my now closed curtains. I had only the faintest impression of the events of the previous night.\n\nIt has only been in years since then that I have come to remember all that I do now about that night...\n\nSince I left that small town, I have undergone regular therapy, and though my therapist is skeptical of my memories of that time in my life, she advised me to tell others about them. I know nobody here will believe me, and many of you may dismiss this event as either paranoid delusions or the overactive imagination of a 7-year-old boy. Trust me when I say I have other memories like it. Still, it's been somewhat therapeutic to write this memory down. Assuming I'm not run off this platform by those who disbelieve, I may recount other stories of the Spire and the misery it brought me in later years.\n\nAfter all, it would be a few more years before the Singer made itself known to me.\n\nI only hope that I don't have my old nightmares tonight. It's been almost a year, but still, maybe reliving these troubling events will cause them to resurface.\n\nThank you for reading. Even if you think I'm full of shit, I appreciate any who made it this far.\n\nGoodbye for now.",

        "text": " \n\nI’m going to tell this story as it happened, so you know exactly where my head was that night. That’s how Tad rolls.\n\nDid I stalk her online? Hell yeah I did. I like to know what I’m getting before I let anybody in my car. All I can say is from her videos and pics she was banging and she had it in all the right ways. I’ve been having some bad dates, and I think it’s about time things turn around. Everything’s coming up Tad.\n\nI put some time into getting ready for this one. I got Rockstar on repeat to get my head in the game. Long shower, some pushups against the sink in front of the mirror. By the time I’m done, my hair is perfect; just the right amount of product. Alot. I check myself out in the mirror.\n\nDamn Tad.\n\nI put on a white button up, acid wash jeans, and my Docs. I post a pic. I just turned thirty nine, but most chicks think I’m thirty. I take care of myself. The shirt’s tight in all the right places. I've been trying to find the perfect size and material that lets me rip the arms if I flex and move just the right way. It took me a while, but I finally found shirts from Penny’s that are perfect. My closet is full of them.\n\nClassic Tad.\n\nI roll up in the Fusion and screech to a badass stop right next to the curb of the address she gave me. I have the windows down and I’m blaring Animals out of the radio. It’s a Nickelback night. I want to set the tone right away. I lay on the horn and goose the gas a bit. She wasn’t outside waiting for me, but I’ve had such a bad streak of dates that I let it go. She lives in a rich neighborhood, and all the rich assholes that live here are all looking out their windows at me. I give ‘em some finger guns and a wink. Soak it in.\n\nShe finally comes running out of that huge ass house. She’s wearing a short black dress. Damn. This girl has no idea how lucky she is.\n\nShe jumps in the car. She turns down the music. I let her. She tells me she’s not hungry, at least not for food. She’s got a party she wants to take me to. I smile. It’s all good. Less money I got to spend on her and more that I can save for the next one. I make my michelins smoke before I jet out of the neighborhood. I’m loud, but it's a hell of a show. \n\nI try to make small talk. I ask her about all those funny flags that were everywhere in her neighborhood. She starts talking about her family; brothers and sisters in the Ukraine or some shit, but I kind of lose my train of thought while I’m staring at her hooters. She video calls one of her friends at the party while I thunder down the road like a friggin boss. Her friend’s hotter than she is. They’re giggling and saying they can’t believe I’m in my thirties. Maybe tonight’s going to be better than I expected. I know from my date’s profile that she’s bisexual, which is a must for Tad even to be interested, because if a threesome is off the table, I walk.\n\n Jackpot Tad.\n\nI pull up to the party house and it’s in the middle of nowhere. Old house with pillars and shit and the paint is just peeling everywhere. The music they’re playing inside is a little fem for me, lots of wailing and screeching violins, but I’m down.\n\nTad adapts.\n\nWe get inside and I realize that I’m surrounded by nothing but chicks all dressed in black. Most of them are fives and sixes, but there are a few solid eights as well. They all welcome us in and one of them tries to give me a glass of red wine. I pull out my flask and wink at her. I tell her Tad comes prepared. My date laughs and yells out that I’m perfect. Just the guy she was looking for. She gets me.\n\nIt doesn’t take long for me to put two and two together. This is gonna get freaky. There’s got to be at least  a thousand candles lighting this place up and there’s curtains over all the windows. There’s some kind of big weird symbol scratched into the wood on the floor, and in the middle of the symbol there’s some kind of altar with leather straps. They’ve got some mounted heads of pigs and goats hanging from the walls and above the huge fireplace there’s some writing on the wall that says, Arise Krthun. My date tells me that they need me for a summoning. I don’t know exactly what that means, but I tell her that sounds dope. It’s obvious what I just walked into. This is some straight up Fifty Shades shit.\n\nThe girls tell me to take my shirt off, and I do my stuff and flex my way out of it. They lead me over to the altar and they lay me down and strap my arms above my head. Here we go.\n\nBaller Tad.\n\nThey circle around me and my date starts speaking in some weird language, which freaks me out at first, but then I remember something about her family being from some other country. There’s thirteen girls in all. It’s gonna be real hard to satisfy this many women. Then I hear a pop and feel a sharp pain. One of them pushes a knife into my right pec. I start screaming at her that I’m not into the cutting thing, but another one of the girls steps forward and cuts my left pec. They start raising their voices in that weird language which I remember now must be Ukrainian. I’m pulling hard against the leather ties, but they strapped me in real good. I’m bleeding everywhere! I look down at the floor and I notice that the blood running out of my chest is falling into that weird carved symbol on the floor. I watch my blood start to follow the outline of the symbol. \n\nI’m starting to get lightheaded. Things are happening. I must be hallucinating because I’m losing so much blood. The walls around us begin to grow mold all over them and a gigantic flame comes out of nowhere in the fireplace. The floor starts to shake and then my date leans down to me and tells me to welcome death.\n\nI’m freaking out. I start pulling on the straps. I can break them if I keep trying. The fire is getting hotter in the fireplace and then I see something moving inside of it. It looks like something straight off a Danzig album and it lets out a scream that makes me almost pass out, but instead I shit my pants. The girls back away from me but they keep speaking those words. I’m going to die. I don’t want to die!\n\nThink Tad! Think! What would Vin Diesel do?\n\nThey’ve tied my arms above my head, and I can feel my wrists against my hair and then I remember when I was getting ready for this awful date. I say the word, “Product!” out loud without even thinking and I begin to rub the back of my head all over my wrists. If I can just get enough gel on my wrists, I might be able to pull myself out of these straps. \n\nSomething that looks like a leg comes out of the fire followed by another. They’re covered in scales and scars and instead of feet, it looks like hands. Finally I see the thing come completely out of the fireplace and stand directly above me. The horns on its head are scraping the ceiling and it opens its mouth full of yellow cracked teeth and screams at me again. Its arms are moving toward me. Oh my God, it has four arms!\n\nI can feel the front of my jeans flood with piss as I keep rubbing my head against my wrists. Wait! I can feel my hands begin to slide through the straps. I might make it.\n\nThe thing reaches down for me just as I slip through the straps and roll onto the floor. The chicks start yelling at each other to grab me, but I stumble forward toward the first covered window I see and throw myself through it. I can hear the giant thing walking on that wooden floor and then the women start screaming. I get up and I look back. It’s eating them and tearing them to pieces. It’s throwing parts of them all over the room. I run for my Fusion. \n\nJust as I open the door, I think I hear the thing breaking through the wall of the house. I don’t want to be next on the menu. I jump in and crank her over hard and tear ass back toward the highway. I keep looking in the rearview in the dark, praying it didn’t follow me. It takes me another hour to get back to the city. I think about calling the cops, but I don’t. I don’t know if anyone would believe this.\n\nThat’s exactly how I remember it. That was three weeks ago, and up to now, I haven’t told anybody. I found out from a buddy that summoning is a bad thing, like I hadn’t already figured that out. I don’t know if that thing is still out there in the sticks, hanging around that old house, but I do know I’m not going to be picking up anymore chicks from Kazakhstan.",

        "text": " No one was ever able to tell us apart. From birth until the age when we could begin to speak, our names were completely interchangeable.  I can picture it now; our already forgetful and borderline useless father unable to recall which son got placed in the green pajamas and which one the blue. Our mother, too busy doing every necessary task to keep the household running, unable, or rather simply uninterested in assigning the correct name to the correct son. Identification was at the very end of her long list of to-dos. I’ve often wondered whether or not I’m really myself. After my parents spun the wheel of names for those first few years, did I end up with the title I was supposed to have been given? Or does my body in actuality belong to him? To Wagner? I guess I’ll never know for certain, but it was our uncanny likeness that prompted the start of everything... \n\n\\-- \n\n“*I’ll be with you the whole time. We’ll be anchored right off the coast. If you need anything, and I mean anything at all-*” \n\nI held up a hand. I knew how to finish the sentence. \n\n“*I’ll use the sat phone*.” \n\nGemma smiled proudly.  If she was nervous, I couldn’t tell. She carried herself with such poise and composure that her other traits were at first glance imperceivable. There was more there though. So much more. My last three weeks with Gemma were spent in a state of monk-like preparation. She meticulously guided me as I fumbled my way through company terminology, financials, projections, names of coworkers and professional rivals, possible acquaintances that I would come across on the island, as well as various random and bizarre details about my brother that I couldn't fathom any practical reason to actually learn; Who’s favorite *Friends* character was Ross? Gemma was a Spartan mother about to send her son off to fend for himself in the wilderness. Hunt or be hunted. She did everything in her power to make sure that I wouldn't be the later.  \n\nGemma took my shirt in her hands and undid the top two buttons- \n\n“*Wagner liked people to think that he didn’t take himself too seriously.*” \n\nA crisp ocean breeze cut across my chest, sent shivers down my body, and made my nipples grow hard.  \n\n“*Could we maybe split the difference?*” \n\nI went to re-do one of the buttons, but my hand was quickly slapped down by Gemma’s.  \n\n“*No. The next six days are about coherence. From the second you step off this boat, you are not you. You are not Eddison. You are his brother. You are CEO of one of the fastest growing companies in the US. You are a tech savant, a recreational diver, a collector of modern and overpriced art, a habitual womanizer, and you leave your top two buttons undone. Always.*” \n\nI sighed. This wasn’t the first time she had to recite this speech to me.  \n\n“*It’s less than a week. You can handle that.”* \n\n“*Well, what about after?*” \n\n“*You lie low and get fat on the company dime. Myself and the members of the board in the know can run things for a while, and then when the time is right and the markets have finally settled, we announce your- His- passing*.” \n\nMy hands began to shake. It wasn’t just the wind this time. Gemma gently took my fluttering appendages into her own grasp and held them tight. She stared deep into my eyes.  \n\n“*You’ve come so far. I’m quite proud of you. I mean it.*”  \n\nI smiled back and offered a quiet nod. I couldn’t say thank you. I couldn’t rejoice in Gemma’s misplaced hope for me. I knew exactly what would happen as soon as I left the island, and returned to America. I would cash the check dangled over my head for the past month, head straight to my dealer, hole up in in my apartment, and dive head first into a sea of hazy bliss. The experience would not change me. It would not make me a better, smarter, more enlightened person. I would not remerge from the island as some sort of vessel for Wagner’s genius. I would stay Eddison Page. I would stay a pill addict, a junkie. I would be less than remarkable forever.  \n\nThe ship’s horn blared. Across the water, a sliver of green began to make itself known and from that thin strip of earth, a small tender tore away and headed straight towards us. Gemma released her grip and handed me my bag.  \n\n“*This is it. Are you ready?*” \n\n“*You aren’t going to dock with us?*” \n\n“*No women on or near the island. Who knows what sort of havoc could be wrecked if a pair of tits made its way into the ranks. This is where we part, I’m afraid*.” \n\nI looked back towards the sea. The tender had somehow already arrived, its driver tethering itself to our dock below. I fiddled with my bag, taking in every last second as myself.  \n\n“*What if this all doesn’t work? What if I slip up or the plan fails or..*.” \n\nGemma cocked her head. \n\n“*Or what?*” \n\n“*I don’t know. Something bad happens?*” \n\nShe chuckled to herself before letting the failing scenario sink in. For a moment her eyes sank. Had she never considered that the plan could fail? Surely, she must have. The whole board must have. A pantheon of scientific titans and not one of them accounting for an Error 500. Impossible. Gemma finished her calculations and as factually as she could mustered a quiet, blatant- \n\n“*Then chaos wins.*” \n\nShe turned me around and pushed me towards the tender.  \n\n“*I’ll see you in a week, Mr. Page.*” \n\n\\-- \n\nThe island was crawling with men. Men of all shapes, sizes, colors, and countries. From the guests to our Malaysian attendants, the Y chromosome was inescapable. I thought back to my adolescence. To a time when my pubescent mind would have used the setting as fodder for more erotic scenarios. These men however weren’t the chiseled jocks examining each other’s bodies in a post pump locker room or the sun-kissed pool boys looking for a workday distraction with their older, more established employers that typically filled my fantasies. These men were a breed unto their own. What they lacked in physical attractiveness they made up for in greatness. One less ab meant one more zero in their bank account. One less hair atop their head equaled one more world problem they were on the cusp of solving.  They were masters of their respective fields. Overlords of science, business, philanthropy. Scions of influence and power. The big names were never in attendance though. No Clinton, or Branson, or Bezos, or Musk. The household names were never extended an invite for the yearly gathering. According to Gemma they were considered far too self-absorbed and removed from reality to contribute anything of substance to The Garden. This meeting, this melding of minds, was meant for the second tier, the toilers. Those who didn’t just come up with the big ideas but actually struggled to achieve them. These men could do things. Unimaginable things. As I stepped off the dingy my knees buckled at the thought of it all.  \n\nSPLASH! \n\nI hit the water face first.  \n\nA group of pastel clad men smoking cigars on the beach began to laugh as two young attendants came running. The first helped me to my feet while the second grabbed my bag that began to float away in the surf.  They kept their heads down and ushered me towards the beach as fast as they could. A third boy approached with a handful of towels and all three began to work away at my clothing.  \n\n“*You always know how to make an entrance, don’t you Page?*” The Green Pastel shouted across the beach.  \n\nThis was it. My first interaction. My first ruse. I furiously scanned the manifest of Waspy men that Gemma had tried to upload to my brain. They looked at me in anticipation. They were waiting for a reply. A retort. A joke. Who were these men? Their names were on the tip of my tongue. I was blanking. Drowning, faster with every second. They knew I was fraud. They could sense it like an odor I emitted. I was not one of them. I didn’t belong here. I wanted to turn around, dive into the water, and swim all the way back to Gemma. \n\nGreen Pastel wouldn’t accept my silence. “*What’s wrong Wagner? Kitty cat got your tongue?*”  \n\nHis accent was thick. Thick and Southern. He was Texan. He had a cliched name. What was it? What was it... Houston! Houston Stevens. He ran a fracking company that operated throughout the Gulf of Mexico- \n\n“*You should give it back since you’re the only pussy I see here.*” \n\nHouston and the other Pastels let out a chuckle as he threw up the bird. The attendants finished drying me off and handed me my bag.  \n\n“*Come join us once you’re settled. I've been waiting all year to own your sweet little ass in some Bacci Ball.*” \n\n“*I bet that’s not the only thing you’ve been wanting to do with this ass.*” \n\nThe Pastels were inconsolable with laughter. I flung my bag over my shoulder and made my way towards a set of villas that I could make out just beyond the tree line. As I crossed the threshold from sand to dirt, their giggling began to morph amongst the acoustics of the jungle and turned to a chorus of demonic cackles. They taunted me with every step I took.  \n\n\\-- \n\nI did my best to steer clear of the other Garden guests and discretely made my way to Wagner’s assigned villa. I dropped my bag to the floor and fell onto the bed with a thud. No more than twenty minutes on the island and I was already spent. How could I possibly last a whole week? I pulled the sat phone from my bag and texted Gemma.  \n\n“*Just got to villa. No slip ups... yet.*” \n\nShe responded almost instantly. Anticipating my anxiety most likely.  \n\n“*We’re off to a good start then. Breathe. You got this.*” \n\nKNOCK! KNOCK! KNOCK! \n\nI shoved the phone into the nightstand drawer like a teen with a porno mag and jumped to my feet. I did as Gemma instructed. I took a breath and opened the door.  \n\n“*Mr. Page. It’s good to see you again. Welcome back to The Garden.*” \n\nThe young Malaysian, holding a fresh set of towels, stared at me with pleasant sincerity and I stared back with blank nothingness. Out of all the faces that Gemma had me study, the local support staff were not included on the list. God damn it Wagner, why did you have to be so fucking charismatic? The attendant awkwardly chuckled and bowed his head in embarrassment. \n\n“*Excuse me, Sir, that was presumptuous of me. I’m sure you must meet so many people. I’m Bishaam. We spoke during last year’s Garden. I’ve been promoted to a valet this summer. Your personal valet.*” \n\nI smiled and dove into the narrative the young man had unwittingly, and thankfully provided. \n\n“*Bishaam. Of course. I’m sorry it’s just... It’s just been a long day of travel. It’s good to see you again... you’ve been well?*” \n\n“*Very. I’ve been sticking to my English classes like you suggested. I’ll be applying for a translator position with the Ministry as soon as I pass my proficiency test*.” \n\n“*Well... you sure sound proficient to me.*” \n\nHe waited for more. Most likely hoping that I would deliver more morsels of bonding from the previous summer’s chat with Wagner, but before I could improvise something generic and feasible, Bishaam  cut my suffering short and handed over the towels in his hands.  \n\n“*Anything that needs washed or clean you can leave in the basket on the porch. I also took the liberty of placing some fresh Ixora on the dressers. I remember you said that you were fond of it.*” \n\n“*Thank you, Bisaam, that’s very thoughtful.*” \n\n“*I will let you be. It is good to see you again, Mr. Page.*”  \n\nBishaam left with a smile and I shut the door with a huff of exhaustion. More names. More people. More storylines to keep straight. I needed a fix. I needed it bad, but I came to the island with nothing. Part of my agreement with Gemma and the company was a mandatory detox and daily room and cavity checks. My demons were of no surprise to them. What Wagner didn’t tell them of my life I’m sure a simple Google search into my past would easily reveal. They knew what issues could arrive with this complex plan but they made sure that my vices would not be a wrench. \n\nI began to sweat. I checked the minibar. Nothing but waters, and juice, and soft drinks. Foolish of me to think that someone would slip up and stock a few bottles of Titos. I ran across the room and threw open the windows. I dashed to the AC and fiddled with the buttons. I worked myself into a tizzy. The air became thick. I couldn’t do as Gemma instructed. I couldn’t breathe. I was having a panic attack. A big one. I hadn’t had one like this since after the accident. Since that fucking car hit us head on, left a gash in my skull and the man next me dead. I needed something. Anything. I ran to the flowers of the desk. I widened my nostrils as far as they could go and sucked in the aroma of Bishaam’s gift. For a moment it worked. The scent calmed me down. It relaxed my mind. I felt light. I felt easy. Then everything began to spin as I blacked out and fell to the floor.  \n\n\\-- \n\nI woke to the sound of drums, distant but close, and felt a thick moisture dripping down the side of my head. I put a hand to the sensation and dabbed. Red. I must have hit my head on the way down. I sat up and looked out the window. The sun had already set and the moon shone brightly over the ocean.  How long was I out for? I grabbed one of Bishaam’s towels and held it to my skull as I opened the door and peaked outside. The chorus of thumping continued as a volley of drunken men, skipped and staggered their way through the villas towards a nearby bridge connecting to the jungle. I clutched the towel to my head and followed after.  \n\n\\-- \n\nThe lamp lit jungle was filled with a cacophony of ululation. I’m not sure if it was my head, the shrieking or the drums, most likely a combination of all three, but my skull began to pound. I walked across the bridge as slowly as I could, one foot in front of the other, as savant after scholar whipped past me reeking of booze. I fell to the floor and vomited off the side of the bridge into a small river.  \n\n“*Poor baby can’t hold his liquor.*” Houston Stevens came up behind me and giggled as he began to feign anal sex with me.  \n\n“*Oh yeah. Page loves it.*” \n\nHis pasteled posse of inebriated imbeciles responded with the same laughter as they did on the beach.  I wanted to break his jaw and toss him into the water below.  \n\n“*You never showed for Bacci Ball*!” \n\nI managed to muster a weak, bile tinged- \n\n“*Tomorrow.*” \n\nHouston completed his penetration and slapped my back. \n\n“*Daddy is looking forward to it. What the hell happened to your head?*” \n\n“*Nothing. I’m fine.*” \n\nThe Pastels grabbed me by the shoulders, pulled me to my feet, and tossed the towel into the river. Houston wrapped his arms around me and aimed me towards the jungle.  \n\n“*Let it bleed. Let’s go! It’s Opening Ceremony!!”* \n\nThey all let out a cheer. I wanted to slit their throats.  \n\n\\-- \n\nIt was a bumble bee. Eight or nine feet tall, carved into the thick body of the tree, and outlined in gold. The way it reflected the moonlight gave it the look of a hieroglyph, like a symbol from the Book of the Dead that pulled some sort of magical trigger. The fifty or so drunken men danced and drank and vomited before it as a small group of attendants off to the side accompanied the madness with a symphony of untamed drums and bells. As we got closer Houston shouted to the group- \n\n“*Buzz, Buzz!*” \n\nThe phrase was recited back, this time amplified by 50-fold.  \n\n“*BUZZ, BUZZ!!*” \n\nHouston tussled my hair like a creepy uncle.  \n\n“*That’s the stuff!*\" \n\nHouston and the Pastels pushed me into the crowd. They circled around me and began to flail their bodies with the rest of the crowd. The vibration of the drums pulsed through my skull. I could feel them inside me. Every note and beat shot a bullet through my veins. I tried to free myself, to escape, to find an out from the painful middle aged mosh pit. It was no use. Everywhere I turned there was an elbow to the ribs, a loose hand to the face, a Pastel to yank me back in. This was chaos. This was hell. I thought I was about to pass out again when from nowhere a loud horn was blown and the music immediately ceased. The men fell to their knees and thankfully so could I.  \n\nAn aged, sturdy man carrying a torch walked through the crowd and ascended the stage before the Bee. He lit a small firepit at the center of the stage, raised his hands to the sky, and yelled to the heavens- \n\n“*Buzz, Buzz Brothers*!” \n\nThe man looked down to face us all. I knew this one. This was an important one, the most important one. He was the Organizer, the Master of Ceremonies. The Garden was his brainchild back in the 70’s. This was James. The men all said hello to him- \n\n“*BUZZ, BUZZ BROTHER!!*” \n\nJames peered down at us like a farmer inspecting his harvest and smiled at his lot.  \n\n“*My Brothers. It’s finally here; Another Garden is upon us!*” \n\nThe men hooted, and hollered, and cheered. \n\n“*Each year we make our pilgrimage to this island. From the four corners of the globe, we travel by sea, and land, and sky to assemble here and revel in a year’s worth of change, a year’s worth of progress. Here no friend, no family, no woman may enter. Here there is only Us. There is only Man. Our Dominance alone and nothing else!*” \n\nThe dominant men roared again.  \n\n“*Over the course of the next few days, we will dance, we will drink, we will be merry. But most importantly we will connect. We will bond. We will become one. So that when we depart, when we return to the fragmented realms that we master, we will know that we are always tethered to our brothers.* \" \n\nAn excited Pastel stood up and let out a loose Buzz. James and a few other attendees began to chuckle. \n\n“*Yes, I know, I’m excited too, Brother. Let us not wait any longer then. Let a new Garden bloom! Invites; To the stage!*” \n\n“*To the Stage! To the stage! To the stage!*” The men ponded their fists on the ground and chanted in unison.  \n\nFrom behind the Bumble Bee, three men with burlap sacks over their heads were led onto the stage as a young attendant produced a chalice and handed it to James.  \n\n“*We drink the nectar of the Garden so that we may always be reminded of how sweet it is. The Garden is our vitality. The Garden is our lifeblood*.” \n\nThe excited Pastel yelled out once more- \n\n“*Drink it up!*” \n\nMore pounding and chanting. “*Drink it up! Drink it up! Drink it up!”* \n\nJames put out a friendly hand to calm his congregation. “*My, my, it’s going to be a fun Garden this year, isn’t it?*” \n\nJames approached the first masked man. “*An invitee of Brother Houston-*” \n\nHouston stood to his feet. \n\n“*Brother Houston, do you invite this man into The Garden?*” \n\nHouston beamed with arrogant, pride, “*I do Brother James*!” \n\n“*Then let us all welcome, Brother Sawyer, Brother Houston’s very own son!*” \n\nJames removed the sack on Sawyer Stevens. The young man, who sadly was just as appealing as his father, took the chalice and drank as everyone let out a cheer and a Buzz. Houston was beside himself with pride as Sawyer descended from the stage and joined his father on the ground. James moved onto the next pledge.  \n\n“*An invitee of Brother Donald-*” \n\nA stuffy looking obese man stood. \n\n“*Brother Donald, do you invite this man into the Garden?*” \n\n“*I do Brother James*.” \n\n“*Then let us all welcome, Brother Reza!*” \n\nJames removed the sack and I stifled a gasp. Reza, unlike the backwoods Texan pledge before him, was stunning. The beautiful, Persian man, who couldn’t have been older than 30 took the cup and drank deeply. The crowd congratulated him and he descended the stairs and took a seat next to his sponsor Donald.  \n\nI couldn’t take my eyes off him. In an ocean of calloused monsters, Reza was a sight to behold. He looked like sea glass. Shiny and smooth and glistening as you pulled it from the water. I studied his face in detail, looking for some sort of flaw or speck of mistake, but there was none. This man was perfect. A true flower for the garden. He turned his head and our eyes locked. I quickly diverted my attention back to the stage where James was approaching the final pledge. \n\n“*An invitee of Brother Wagner-*” \n\nI gulped. I stood. I thought back to my lessons with Gemma. Who did she say Wagner invited? Did she even say at all? My mind raced to think who this person was or could be, but there was nothing. Gemma had not mentioned this in our studies. The man behind the sack was as big a mystery to me as it would be to the other men.  \n\n“*Brother Wagner, do you invite this man into The Garden?*” \n\n“*Yes I- I do. Brother James...”* \n\nHe nodded and smiled.  \n\n“*Then let us all welcome, Brother Tiger!*” \n\nAs James removed the sack, the congregation went quiet. There were no cheers, there was no buzzing or hurrahs or fraternal jubilation. There was only silence and then an obnoxious and repugnant voice. Houston’s. \n\n“*What the hell?!*” \n\nWhispers began to work their way through the crowd as the realization slowly began to set in. The man standing before us came with an asterisk. Why though? Who was this man. The congregation began to cry heresy. At James, at Tiger, and at myself- \n\n“*You’ve got to be kidding me!”  “Is this a joke?”  “I know a man when I see one!”* \n\nTiger held firm. He did not move. James put out a hand to try and calm the zealots beneath him.  \n\n“*My Brothers... Brothers please..*.” \n\nThey wouldn’t stop though. The taunts kept going. The hate kept spewing. And the anger kept flowing. \n\nHouston stared daggers at me from the ground.  \n\n“*What the fuck, Page!?*” \n\nJames grew frustrated and tired of the insolence before him. From the depths of his diaphragm, he released an Earth shattering- \n\n“*ENOUGH!*” \n\nEveryone settled. I looked to Tiger who looked like steel. Completely unphased and unbothered. James's voice echoed throughout the jungle.  \n\n“*The world- society- is constantly changing. In order for our Garden to truly blossom, for our roots to reach deep across the Earth, we must change as well!*” \n\nDonald stood- \n\n“*James this isn’t... this is not*\\-” \n\nHe tried to find the right words. I looked to his side, to his pledge Reza who looked down at the Earth with the same steely stare that Tiger adorned.  \n\n“*This is not the... this place... this place is meant for... for men*!” \n\nTiger stepped forward and snatched the chalice from James’ hand. \n\n“*I am one*.” \n\nHe drank deep as all sets of eyes turned to me.  \n\n\\-- \n\nA meeting was called.  James, Houston, a few other senior members, Tiger, and myself sat at large round table in James’ villa. Houston and a few men argued to remover Tiger immediately. Another faction fought for him to stay. Tiger sat in his same unbreakable silence he arrived with at the ceremony. James listened to all sides, cupped his hands in a ball over his mouth, and after a few moments finally spoke- \n\n“*I have to say I anticipated a bit of backlash, but nothing quite like this... I began this retreat more than half a century ago so that the men who watched over this world could have a week of peace and bonding. However, it is quite evident that the peace I sought to establish may not fully take effect under the current situation and whatever bonding could happen is at risk when there is conflict such as this. Brother Houston; I have heard your arguments. And while I understand your concerns, we cannot deny that the world today is different than the one in which The Garden was first established. That being said you are a forever and well-respected member of this brotherhood and Brothers always come first.*” He then looked to me, to Wagner- \n\n“*Brother Wagner; you are also a well-respected member of this order.  This is your guest. You have invited them to the Garden. You have identified a quality within them that you thought would enhance the Brotherhood and in effect help make the world a more connected, better place. You will be the deciding voice. The decision lies with you*.” \n\nI had gone from one of the popular kids to a social pariah in less than a day and the status of my remaining time on the island, all relied on my next set of words. I wish I could say that I did the brave thing, that I chose justice, that I made a conscious decision to further the status and platform of a fellow member of the LGBTQ+ community, but I didn’t. My decision was based entirely around self-preservation. If I allowed Tiger to stay, to enforce Wagner’s choice, I would be black balled. No one would speak to me and I could ride out this week hopefully not having to interact with anyone. Maybe being a pariah wouldn’t be so bad. I’ve been adjacent to it for most of my life, what was six more days?  \n\n“*Tiger stays.*” \n\nAnd it was done.  \n\n\\-- \n\nI walked back to my villa in relief. I could hide in my room for the rest of my stay, practically retreat and no one would care. I could achieve Gemma and the company’s goal of showing face, presenting Wagner as alive and well before the company went public, all while staying true to my shrinking, private self. I began to smile. I felt a sense of ease for the first time in a while. Then I hit the dirt. \n\n“*Traitor.*”  \n\nHouston and two of the anti-Tiger faction walked past and spat at me in contempt. Shit. I began to wonder if I had really made the smart choice after all.  \n\nI got to my knees and examined my elbows and palms, both coated in dirt and specks of blood. That, along with my still open forehead, made me look like someone who had escaped a mugging rather than enjoying a tropical vacation. A voice from behind me- \n\n“*Wow. You really look like shit*.” I turned to Tiger, smoking and chuckling against a palm tree. He took a long drag and blew out into the moonlight. \n\n“*You did a pretty stupid thing just now, you know that?*” \n\n“*What was I supposed to have done? Send you back after inviting you all this way?”*  Wagner didn’t have to be annoyed; I was plenty irked at Tiger’s seemingly casual ungratefulness. \n\n“*Don’t get all pissy. We both knew we were doing. We brought a storm with us. Lighting strikes were-  are to be expected. Also, I’m not great with ‘Thank You’s.’ But you know that already.*” \n\nTiger took another drag. “*Let’s chat tomorrow over breakfast. I want to hear more about this ‘World Changing Idea’ of yours.*”  \n\nI got to my feet and quickly tried to negate the proposal.  “*Let’s do it after we leave. When we’re back home. I’ll have my people... call your people. I want to just relax this week*.” \n\nTiger laughed heartily and stubbed out his cigarette.  \n\n“*Please. I can already tell no one comes to this place to relax*.” \n\nHe pulled a bottle of pills from his pocket, popped one, and tossed the bottle to me.  \n\n“*What’s this?*” \n\n“*Fresh from San Fran. Don’t worry. It’s completely pure. I told you; I’m not good with ‘Thank You’s.*\"  Tiger began to saunter back into the jungle.  \n\n“*I’ll see you tomorrow*.” \n\nHe was gone and I was left alone with a bottle pills. I wish I could say it was hard for me. That I struggled with the devil and angel on my shoulders. That I made a real effort to stick to the sobriety that Gemma, the company, and myself worked so hard to achieve, but if I said all that it would be a lie. And this story is only the truth. I emptied four neon pink pills into palm and dry swallowed them as quickly as I could.  \n\n\\-- \n\nI sat on the beach and watched the surf roll in beneath the moonlight. The sand felt like silk between my fingers. I couldn’t stop sifting through it, swirling my palms in large motions by my side, making tiny crop circles in the ground. Tiger was right, this stuff was pure. I fell back and began to make sand angels. I looked up to the stars that shone with a vibrancy I had never seen before, not just because whatever drugs were coursing through my system were top of the line, but because the sky out here was so clear, completely unfettered by skyscraper or plane or streetlamp. Even though my heart was pounding through my chest at a mile a minute, the familiar calm that took over me was indescribably soothing. I basked in the glow of the cosmos above and began to cry. I would only ever truly be at peace when I was in this state of nothingness, when I was lost. My crying ceased and my heart went still when I heard a voice, his voice, beside me- \n\n“*Eddison.*” \n\nIt wasn’t him. It couldn't be him. He was no more, gone in a blink of an eye. He was gone and buried just like my brother was. His stuff was sold and his mail was shredded when it kept arriving at the apartment. My fiancé was just that. He was shredded. Un-whole. Unable to be put back together or saved. This was not him. It was merely a drug indued mirage caused by Tiger’s potent pink pills. I knew it. But even though I knew it, I still couldn’t help myself. I opened my eyes and turned my head- \n\n“*Brett*?” \n\nHe smiled brightly at me, his teeth looking like pearls in the moonlight. He was ghostly but only in a way that made him shimmer, made him sparkle.  \n\n“*Is this real? How are you-*” \n\nHe put a hand to his lips and I stifled my sentence. Brett took me in. Every wrinkle, every hair, every cell of my skin. He saw me in death, just as he did when he was alive; completely and totally. He raised a hand, hovered it in front of my face, and whispered- \n\n“*Run.*” \n\nHe touched my forehead and my whole being began to shake. Limb by limb, every cell in my body began to vibrate as searing pain shot from my skull down to my toes.  What was happening? What was this ghost, this drug induced hallucination doing to me?  \n\n“*Brett... Brett...*” \n\nI couldn’t speak. My mouth was going dry and I couldn’t feel my tongue. Was I convulsing? Having a seizure? The ghost offered no help, instead Brett stood, raised his hands above his head, and as if he was being doused in tar, his body began to turn an icy black. His eyes rescinded into his head, his mouth sinched itself shut, and all discerning features began to succumb to the strange oily substance that began to coat his body. I was frozen in fear. What was going on? I had never had a trip like this before. One so terrifying, so specific, so utterly heart stopping. It all felt too real. I managed to get to my knees and begin to crawl away.  \n\nAs I crawled, I heard a roar. I turned back and saw not Brett, but a monster. His coating was complete and he began to float. He rose higher and higher off the sand until he hovered above me, a good seven or eight feet above the ground. His new self-looked like a shadow against the moonlight. I got to my knees and ran.  \n\n\\-- \n\nAcross the beach, over the trees, and through the villas, Brett’s Shadow chased after me. I looked up to the sky. Brett hovered above and stared down at me through an opening in the trees. He roared in anger and began descending, like a comet. I staggered as fast as I could towards my villa. The pain was still so strong. Every step, every inch, sent a shock through my nerves. I reached the porch. I fumbled for my key. I looked back the way I came; Brett had reached ground level and was gliding straight for me with his arms outstretched. It was coming for me. It wanted to consume me. I found my key, ran into my villa, and shut the door in the Shadow’s face.  \n\nI locked the door, through a chair beneath the handle, and slumped to the floor as I began to sob. I did not want to be on this island. I did not want to be doing weird frat brother rituals with the rich and powerful. I did not want to be an addict. I had a good a life. A life I loved. A man I loved. All I wanted was Brett.  \n\nAs my heart began to slow, I looked around the room and noticed that my things were everywhere. Clothes, toiletries, towels, even the flowers Bishaam had gifted me were turned over and smashed. What the hell happened? Was it the work of Houston and his clan of good ol’ boys? Or someone else who had some sort of bone to pick with Wagner? It didn’t matter. I was done with all of it. One day on this island was already far too many. I didn’t care if I got the check from the company. I didn’t care if I let Gemma down, if all our prep and hard work was for naught. I was tapping out. I ran to the bedside table and threw open the drawer.  \n\n“*No.... no...no!*” \n\nI must have felt every square inch of that small, hollow, retractable box, but there was nothing. Nothing at all.  \n\nThe sat phone was gone. ",

        "text": "I sat by the fire and exhaled slowly before taking in the cool night air. The fire danced and crackled along to its natural rhythm and the hidden army of crickets soon took up their famous chirp. This time used to be my favorite part of camping, just immersing myself in the calm solitude these mountains never failed to provide while watching dusk fade to night was always the perfect way to end a long day spent in the woods. I was deep in thought when something pulled me quite violently out of my thoughts and filled me with dread, I felt like I was being watched. The crickets had stopped and been replaced by a low, almost musical, humming that seemed to come from all around my camp, just outside the firelight. I peered into the inky abyss between the trees illuminated by my fire, attempting in vain to find the source of this noise. I have a history of occasional auditory hallucinations, usually before and after sleep, so I chalked it up to exhaustion and decided to turn in for the night.\n\nAfter kicking out my fire, which was already burning low, the humming seemed to slowly get louder and closer but I still thought it was only a hallucination at the time so I ignored it and continued over to my tent. By the time I was zipped up in my sleeping bag, the humming was nearly deafening so I sat curled up in the fetal position at the bottom of the sleeping bag with my hands clutched over my ears. The noise was still growing closer, to the point where I felt it more than heard it, the sound of a freight train thundering all around my camp, vibrating the very earth I was laying on. It got closer and closer, louder than I thought possible, and just when I thought surely my eardrums would give out from the pressure and I would be deaf, it stopped. At this point, I was too shaken to move or really do anything, no way I could make it to my car, so I sat there shaking and crying, eventually drifting off to sleep.\n\nWhen I woke up, the events of the night before were completely off my mind. I lazily started a fire to make breakfast and coffee and it wasn’t until the coffee was halfway brewed and I was absent-mindedly staring into the open flame that the trauma I had experienced the night before slowly started seeping its way back into my thoughts. I sat down next to the fire and contemplated the events of the night before. No hallucination I have ever experienced has ever been louder than a normal speaking voice, and perhaps more importantly, I felt the ground shake with my whole body and my hallucinations have never been more than auditory. I knew logically that it couldn’t be a simple hallucination but at the time I was a strict skeptic and another explanation eluded me so I decided to continue my camping trip. Not only that but I already took the time off work and wouldn’t get another chance to come out here for a while so I desperately didn’t want to shorten my already limited time camping. After deciding to ignore the events of the night before, I enjoyed my camping trip like any other. I hiked, fished, and even went for a very cold swim in the nearby lake, my trauma, almost entirely forgotten in the light of the day, was easy to ignore without any physical evidence or lasting damage.\n\nBy the time I made my way back, the shadows had grown long and the sunlight had grown orange so I immediately started getting a fire going when a familiar dread crept its way back into my psyche with its accompanying hum. I quickly turned away from my unfinished campfire to scan the treeline for an unseen observer and caught movement in the corner of my eye, but naturally, by the time my head snapped over, there was nothing to see but trees and fading sunlight, and the faint sound of humming. Cold terror shot down my spine and voices that didn’t feel like mine filled my head with the words “go away” in a panicked voice. I may have had a history of hallucinations but this was simply too much, I was going home. I started taking down my tent, hoping to get cleaned up before the sun left me alone in the dark, but the feeling of dread was growing worse and the sun was fading faster than I thought it would. I was still struggling to fit everything in the bag with shaking hands when I looked up to watch the last holdouts of sunset fall beneath the horizon and felt a much worse sense of dread settle deep within me.\n\nI saw a tall figure creeping towards me through the trees in the post-sunset light, pale and upright but too far away to make out details beyond that. The humming noise grew with the approach of the mysterious creature, causing me to freeze in place for a couple of seconds before grabbing for my keys and bolting to my car, but not before noticing the thing take off towards me as soon as I moved for my keys. I was enveloped by the ever-present humming that terrified me the night before, but in the moment it felt only comforting, like an old friend who had my back. I pulled open the door to my car and felt something sharp graze my shoulder as I slid in and slammed the door. I looked out my window and this thing was running full tilt at my car but only moving backward, *something* was not only keeping it at bay but actually pushing back this white thing that so threatened my life and so injured my shoulder. The buzzing was as loud as it had ever been before and the space in front of the creature was *blurry*, obstructing my view, but I had no time to contemplate the implications of these facts. I yanked my car into drive and broke every speed limit on the way home, I still don’t know what that thing was, but I’m thankful for whatever made that buzzing noise, I think it saved my life. I'm also not too broken up about leaving my camping supplies behind, I'm sticking to the city from now on.",

        "text": "Original story by u/iz_that_mj and edited by u/ThePhobos1\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHeavy rain crashed down onto the windshield of the aging truck, the old engine could barely mangle basic tunes, it was raw, dirty, and off-pitched, but nevertheless, to my amazement, it still worked. It cut through the dense air like a violin bow sharpening across its strings. The engine pulsated in the inner arteries of the vehicle, smacking against the ribcage of the hood and sharp bumps stretched the suspension of the ford. The truck slowed to a halt, arriving at an old run-down dirt path. The forest was in a solitude of silence and only the echoes of raindrops bounced off the dying branches. I peered through the window and gazed up at the stormy sky above me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI picked up the dispatch radio and pressed the button to speak, “What am I even doing out here anyways?” I asked the dispatcher.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“I only know as much as you, what's your ETA?” he replied coldly. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI sighed, stepping on the gas pedal and propelling the truck deeper into the woods, “T-Minus 10.” \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI figured I might as well make the downtime useful and quiz myself on the recent codes added to the directory of the park service:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n10-56: Intoxicated Person. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n10-14: Prowler.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n10-79: Notify Coroner.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd 10-16 was- \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI paused for a moment, breaking the rhythm of answers with my own question. Domestic Problem? A thought rang through me, no…no, *disregard*, it’s disregard!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“The little things Whimsey, the little things,” I muttered under my breath.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe old truck let out an ear-splitting screech before coming to a halt, the hot engine fizzling out as cold raindrops dripped through the hood. An amusing thought entered my brain. According to the procedure, subtlety is the goal. It’s probably not a good idea to sound like a 3rd-grade chorus class when we pull up to the scene right? I stepped out of the truck behind me, snapping the rusty door close with a bit of struggle, then wiping my hands on my old blue jeans, before shoving them into my jacket partly to shield my hands against the unrelenting cold and partly in search of a flashlight. In my pockets, I felt a foreign unfamiliar object in my right pouch. I paused for a moment, my hand paralyzed before the currents of hesitation subsided and I pulled it out and held it into the air. Within the darkness, it was like a star in the night sky, its yellowish glow gleamed off the reflection of the moonlight. It was a gold-coated nugget but looked more like a cocoon than anything. Memories fit in the crease of my hand like a quarter in a coin slot. It was an old family heirloom my mother had handed down to me. It was made of real gold, obviously, but I didn't know why it was a cocoon. My mind went silent for a few moments contemplating its origins, before refocusing on the task ahead. I placed the cocoon in my breast pocket and averted my gaze forward. In front of me, an aging wooden sign stood ahead of me. I squinted my eyes in the rain, and in bold letters, the words *Illusie Path* were engraved into the almost transparent sign. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“You got to be kidding me! This is where all the snobby upper-class soccer moms driving Suburban Chevrolets doing 15 in a 25 texting their beta male, balding husbands about how the world's ending because their cappuccino was flat this morning take their kids for a hike,” I shouted into the tree line.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI nearly jumped out of my skin when the radio jingled, “I heard that. Are you at the house?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI scrambled for a response, “Uh-yeah…I mean- Roger!” \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe dispatcher growled in a stern voice, “Remember Whimsey, subtle, no lights, no loud sounds.” \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMentally, I chuckled. If subtly was the goal, the truck wouldn’t have a giant red and blue popsicle strapped to the front of the grill blaring an obnoxiously loud siren. A two-story house stood before me, the sparkling snow-white paint gave the appearance of a second moon in the dark sky. Its large, maroonish chimney loomed over the desolate meadow. As I made my way up to the front of the house, I inspected the slush-covered porch for footprints and found…a whole lot of nothing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI looked up at the second story of the house, a wide roof overhang made it difficult to see inside. As I approached the door, I could make out a figure standing in the large window wall of the living room. It remained perfectly still, carefully maintaining a dark shroud that concealed it from me, yet within the haystack of darkness, I made out the needle hiding within it. A small, yet vibrant hint of orange taunted me from beyond the veil. Whoever was standing there, did so with a purpose, like it wanted me to notice it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Park Service, you’re trespassing!” I shouted.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor a few moments, silence eroded the authority in my voice, and made way for dread to descend upon me. After no reply, I slowly nudged the oak door, which to my surprise, creased open. I hesitated for a moment before taking a few steps forward into the house. Gently, I caressed my fingers near the doorframe and inspected the latch, I twisted the doorknob a few times and inspected the lock for any signs of a break-in, but no marks were around the strike plate and the key hold and latch weren’t bent or warped in any way. As I gazed at the door, a slow tune reared throughout the house and escaped through the doorway. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*I go out walkin' after midnight*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Out in the moonlight, just like we used to do*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*I’m always walkin’ after midnight*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Searchin’ for you*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*I walk for miles along the highway*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Well, that's just my way of sayin’ I love you*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the house, there were also no signs of forced entry. No shattered glass scattered belongings, or slushy footprints. The aesthetic of the house withheld the ancient principles of graciousness, vintage 50s informality, and family privacy. A classic American wallpaper filled with planets, galaxies, and stars stretched across the house. Lit only by ardent candles, I could make out what appeared to be a woman coming down the stairs. She wore a black and orange dress, with the predominantly orange part covering her torso up to her neck, before fizzling out into black long sleeves. Tiny white polka dots populated her dark stockings and her luscious brown hair reached down to her back and was practically glowing. Against the whiteness of her skin, her rosy cheeks looked like the sun on the Japanese flag, but something was off with her. She stood perfectly still. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Park Service, you’re trespassing!” I yelled again as I shined my flashlight toward the woman.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe maintained her unwavering posture and stonewall expression, I could make out a small frigid smile plastered across her marble-white face. Is…that a mannequin? I thought as I crept up closer to the woman. I just stared at the thing like I just stumbled across the Holy Grail. Its left foot was slightly raised and its sleek hand rested upon the wooden railing. Like it was ready to take another step before I interrupted it…or something. After the hypnosis of dumbfoundedness finally lifted, I gave the mannequin one last sideways look. Who puts a mannequin here out of all places? I made the decision to sweep the bottom floor first and turned around and headed for the living room. A giant brick fireplace with traditional colonial-style molding stood against the wall firmly, producing a mature and zealous flame. Maple furniture, two couches, a cyan blue recliner chair, and a redwood coffee table decorated the 50s design of the room.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*I go out walkin' after midnight*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Out in the moonlight, just like we used to do*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*I’m always walkin’ after midnight*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Searchin’ for you*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*I walk for miles along the highway*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Well, that's just my way of sayin’-*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWithout warning, the slow tune that provided sound for the deaf canvas of the house was extinguished, it was like the arteries of the house had stopped pumping blood. Simultaneously, the fireplace went out and engulfed the room in darkness. I froze for a few mind-numbingly long seconds before hearing heavy thumps of boots trickle down the steps in quick succession but the footsteps eroded halfway before drowning out entirely. I exited the living room and back into the hallway, gun drawn. I stared at the stairs for a long hard second, trying to decipher the portrait being painted. Forget about finding answers, I was still trying to piece together questions, but then memory slapped me straight across the face. The mannequin…had disappeared. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA metallic clamp rang behind me. I paused for a second before instinct whipped me around. My arms felt like they’d evaporated into jelly. Droplets of sweat began rolling down my forehead, paving the way for sheer terror to wash across my face. The mannequin towered in front of the now-sealed door. Like a fortress, it stood firm, and even though my gun was drawn, an unwavering expression was etched into its burnished face. Its petite arm outstretched forward, pointing at me…no, behind me! A few steps above me stood another mannequin. This one, unlike its petite counterpart, was colossal in mass. Its brutish bulky arms were both outstretched forward. In a panic I fired, the gunshot rang throughout the house as if a bolt of lightning had electrified the home. In a flash, the bullet’s velocity met head-on with the mannequin and hit it square in the nose, but the bullet didn’t penetrate the metallic coating. It hadn’t even dented it. The shell fell limp and I watched it skid down the stairs like a rock being thrown across a body of water. As the bullet stopped jittering, an encompassing blinding light stung my retinas like a horde of bees. I stammered backward trying to shield my eyes. The light in front of me rapidly moved counterclockwise, I tried to follow it, but in my disoriented state, I started to lose balance and staggered into the wall. The light reared back and blistered towards me. A force, which felt like a thousand men crashed straight into me. My gun clanked to the floor, I tried to lift myself and crawl towards it, but a hand clamped down on my ankle. I turned just in time to catch a glimpse of something dense and shadowy barreling toward my face before everything went black.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy vision was like static on a TV, but my eyes reception eventually came through and I slowly regained my bearings. I was outside, right in front of the window wall. The previously maroonish chimney was blanched of its color. In the drought of quietude, the freshwater of a faint melody filled the empty glass of silence. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*I go out walkin' after midnight*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Out in the moonlight, just like we used to do*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*I’m always walkin’ after midnight*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Searchin’ for you*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*I walk for miles along the highway*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Well, that's just my way of sayin’ I love you*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI took a deep breath, and the air exited my nose and splattered across the glass panel. Like a brush, it painted a scene onto the canvas. As the sketch cleared, the window creaked open slightly, and the past slowly inched its way out. It wasted no time entering my eyes, the window to the soul. Cautiously, I reared my head upwards and peered through the window wall. I saw myself, or at least a younger version of myself. A top-heavy, bottom-light face, a sharp chin, and high cheeks. His youthful skin radiated like a newborn star, and he was wearing an ocean blue hoodie and dark sweatpants that covered a well-defined but lacking bone mass, frame. He was sitting against a colorless light brown wall, the maroon beneath it bleeding from the aging inner arteries of the building and spilling out onto the pavement beneath him. A few moments passed before I started to notice movement in front of where he was sitting. They were like shadows, but with no traceable shape or size. They were there…but weren’t at the same time. Every so often, one of these shadows would stop, and I’d hear laughter and giggling. He’d look up, smile, and reach his hand out robotically, like a machine contacting water his movements were jagged and unrhythmic. No hand ever met his, and with it, the smile on his face would vanish unnaturally quickly and he’d resume his regular, static posture. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe backdrop collapsed in on itself and then morphed into a familiar sight. Those scratched-up and heavily damaged walls sored my eyes as old discarded memories of my childhood attic rushed back into me. I could make out two distinct shadows, and muffled sounds of arguments, thumps, and thuds escaped through the long barrel of the past. No…no this is not right! Why, why am I seeing this? I don’t know what I was feeling, but like a snake, it slithered its way through my veins, burrowing deep into the crust of my heart. I wailed at the bite. Out of desperation, I tried blowing at the window, trying to change what I saw, when the air cleared I still saw the same damned image. I screamed and hit the window with full force, punching the window with as much power as I could muster. Again, and again I hit the window, and when that didn’t work I threw myself at it. Why won’t it break? I slammed my head against the wall, and tears scattered out of my eyes like bees in a beehive. As they rolled down my cheek, they stung my skin with agony. He still lay there, alone, his soul splattered across the wall, that fixed look still painted across his face, when suddenly he perked up. A small butterfly appeared above him, its wings a verdant, lincoln green texture. He reached out to it, and the insect's scrawny legs landed gently on the surface of his desert, peach-colored hand. It jittered slightly, before moving one of its legs as if his hand was sand it was digging into. He winced in pain, but before he could react any further, a sudden wave of understanding eroded his discomfort. After a few minutes, the butterfly’s wings flapped rapidly, and it leveled itself onto his well-contoured nose. A smile outstretched across his face, and his vision darted towards my direction…locking eyes with me as he outstretched his hand.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI could make out the word, *Papilio* before falling back into the deep channels of unconsciousness.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy lungs jerked upwards and clawed at the air. Too much wind retreated into my body, and I breathed rapidly whilst trying to siphon the oxygen out of it. A piercing migraine danced through my head, and a throbbing pain resided in my ankle. My eyes fluttered, and I could partially see my surroundings, but my peripheral vision was lagging behind. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was effectively looking through binoculars as I began poking around with my hand, “Hello?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDread began creeping up my fingers as I couldn’t feel anything but the cold surface of the walls.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Hello!” I shouted in a panic.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNo response. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Hello?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLike a cut phone line, a figure punctured my call. From beyond the darkness, an opaque shadow reached for me. Its five alloyed fingers outstretched, but it remained motionless. Scratched-out and transparent incisions were etched into the center of its palm. I was shattered like broken glass, but I staggered upwards and collected the scattered pieces of my strength. I tilted my head slightly and more of the metalized arm came into view. Soon, I could see a full exoskeleton hunched over, reaching toward me. It was a marble white color with dark sinking voids for eyes. Unlike the previous mannequins, it wore no clothing, nor had any distinct features. However, there on its chest, was an engraved spotlight, no doubt a source of the almost blinding light I had seen earlier, yet this time it wasn't on. I peered into its eyes and saw darkness. As I gazed upon it longer, I swore I could hear a faint pulse. It was wobbly and off-balance, but it was there. I don’t know why, but this profuse urge to feel the mannequin overcame me. It was the same feeling a soldier would feel when one of their own was wounded, or a parent when their child fell ill. I was expecting the mannequin to move, or wince when my hand met its body, but it remained perfectly still. Instead of a cold and desolate feeling, the mannequin was warm, and although it wasn’t moving even in the slightest, I could feel it taking breaths in and out like it was alive. I reached down and felt the cold, dim bulb. Then, something dawned on me. I placed my hand on the mannequin's empty head and turned far enough to where it was absent from my vision. After a moment, I could feel the mannequin's head begin to turn and I immediately relocked my eyes onto it. Its head had moved slightly to the left, almost making eye contact with me. I figured these things can’t move if I keep them within eyesight.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMaintaining the mannequin within my peripheral vision, I scanned the room and realized I was in the attic. I noticed a large black blanket sitting in a pile towards the corner of the room and I got an idea. I tip-toed gradually towards the blanket and picked it up. Underneath it were two thick wool-embroidered belts. I tip-toed back and wrapped it around the mannequin’s chest, covering the dark spotlight. If this thing can freeze me with its light, and I can freeze it by looking at it, I’m going to make sure I’m the colder of the two. I took the two belts and tied the mannequin's ankles and wrists as securely shut as possible before tripping the mannequin onto the floor. I slowly backed away and inched my way to the attic trapdoor, before realizing that it was locked. The lock was rusty and could be easily broken using the mannequin's steel-toed boots, but the thought of touching the mannequin again chilled me to the bone. So I kicked it open myself before descending the cold wooden ladder and looking around. Toward the end of the hallway and at the start of the staircase stood a giant, golden clock. I paused for a moment and the question of *where I was,* pulled me closer to the gravity of the situation. *What do I do?* Pulled me even closer. I could go searching around in this place, but I put an asterisk next to that idea quickly. I checked my body and realized I didn’t have my gun. God only knows how many of these things there are in this house. Not only would I be wandering around blindly, but doing it defenseless. Even with a weapon, I’d still be a deer in headlights. I looked over at the clock again as if it could give me any answers. If I could just make it pass the clock and down the stairs and out of the house I could call for backup, get the extra handgun we have in the passenger side seat, and wait. I inched my way toward the stairway and peered downstairs. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Crap!” I muttered under my breath.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe two other mannequins I’d encountered earlier were both standing in the entrance hall. The female mannequin was pressed up against the right side of the door, and the other one looked like it was making its way into the living room, its light blasting into the hallway. Both of them were positioned in such a way that if I made it to the door, the one going into the living room would be obstructed from my vision. This was the one with the light on, and I cannot risk losing sight of it. I sculpted the scene and was able to carve out both figurines. On the wall across the living room, a desk with a mirror on top of it reflected into the living room, and more importantly, I could see the mannequin with its light on. If I could simultaneously maintain vision with the mirror and the mannequin by the door, I could get out. As I crept down the stairs, the house sounded like it had stretched out, it creaked and groaned. I paused for a second, but the silence of the house remained firm. I hurried my pace down the stairs and carefully maintained visuals on both mannequins. I steered my gaze towards the mirror, and temporality lost sight of the mannequin heading into the living room. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“You Motherfucker!” I yelled.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOnly a split second had passed before I could see the reflection, and the mannequin had already turned around, its blinding light shooting out like splinters from a tree. I swerved my vision away from the light and I was beginning to turn around and make a run for it. Just before I did, I stopped. Never before had the chilling aura of silence felt so relieving. The brute mannequin wasn’t able to fully turn around. Its light was slightly off angle, enough to where I could see both mannequins. I backed up slowly, and my hand found the knob of the door. Winds of solace drafted through the doorway and I almost lost my balance shuffling my way out of the house and shutting the door tight. The apathetic breeze’s whispers were cold and callous, and by now the rain had turned into freezing rain, and tiny shards of ice tapped the ground like a cautious drummer. I fumbled across the slick porch and down the long winding pathway, I opened the truck door and reached for the glove box on the passenger side seat. I pulled the spare handgun out and reached for my radio. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“10-16! We-” my sentence stopped dead in its tracks, along with the static radio ambiance. I noticed the cocoon sitting on the dashboard. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Impossible, I had it right here-” my thought was interrupted when my fingers fumbled around the now empty breast pocket.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI picked up the cocoon and upon a closer look, something was different. Running down the center of it was a thin, but very distinguishable crack. I ran my fingers down it, the crevice was coarse and oddly warm. Before I could inspect it further, an unwinding noise crackled through the radio, and unintelligible speech played in reverse before switching gears to a familiar grainy jingle:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*I go out walkin' after midnight*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Out in the moonlight, just like we used to do*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*I’m always walkin’ after midnight*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Searchin’ for you*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*I walk for miles along the highway*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Well, that's just my way of sayin’ I love you*",

        "text": "The screaming in the hall echoed and distorted as new voices joined it. Sometimes the subjects screamed so loudly and for so long they ripped their vocal cords apart or would start spewing blood from torn capillaries in their throats. \n\nI smiled to myself. Personally, I had nothing against any of these men and women here, even though some of them were from al Qaeda, the Islamic State, or Mexican drug cartels. We had murderers, torturers, rapists, terrorists and gang members galore to experiment on. But who was I to judge their actions? After all, I wasn’t a much better person- I was just on a different side. I tortured people for the CIA, and to protect the USA above all.\n\n“Jay,” a chubby blonde secretary with a moon face said from behind me. I turned to look at her.\n\n“Cheryl,” I said, nodding my head and smiling pleasantly. Cheryl was the ultimate in compartmentalization. At home, she was just a regular soccer mom with kids and PTA meetings. Here, she was an efficient bureaucrat for a secret black ops project that regularly tortured people, sometimes even to death. She kept each part of her life separate and never seemed bothered by switching from one to the other. Her help had likely prevented dozens of terrorist attacks and kidnappings across the globe.\n\nThe screaming was almost deafening now so I pulled her by her arm and we headed towards a nearby break room, where I poured myself a cup of coffee and lit a cigarette.\n\n“So I have good news,” she said cheerily, smiling a fake, sweet smile at me. “Your new method of enhanced interrogation has a 95% success rate.”\n\n“95%!” I exclaimed, elated. “That’s higher than waterboarding or sensory deprivation or anything else. Actually, that’s exponentially higher.”\n\nThe new method of enhanced interrogation, a euphemism for torture, involved a drug called Salvia divinorum. We would extract the main psychoactive chemical from it, which was called Salvinorin A, and run an IV drip into the subjects. Normally, Salvia divinorum was smoked and created intense, dysphoric hallucinations that rapidly faded after a few minutes. But by running an IV drip of the drug, we could keep the subjects drugged in a nightmare horror state for days or weeks. Their minds would start to snap after weeks straight of the drug, however. At times we would combine the effects of the drug with sensory deprivation or waterboarding on the most hardened subjects.\n\nBeing a scientific man myself, I had tried a single IV syringe of Salvinorin A, so that I would know what the subjects were going through. Just that one dose was immensely horrible. I saw myself getting cut up into five pieces, the room falling apart, the fake plastic plants decorating my office started talking to me and mocking me with sarcastic movements. It was an incredibly uncomfortable and disorienting experience for the three or four minutes that it lasted, and I could see why even the most psychopathic killer would start to crack after days straight of living in that constantly nightmarish world. \n\nCheryl held out a folder to me, a Top Secret label and CIA insignia embedded into the front of it. I frowned and took it.\n\n“What’s this?” I asked, opening it up. \n\n“You are being moved,” she said, putting her hands up. “Look, I tried to argue against it, telling them your research here wasn’t finished, but they insisted they have something far more important for you stateside. They want you to leave Guantanamo Bay within fifteen minutes. They have a helicopter waiting for you outside already.”\n\n“This is ridiculous!” I said, my heart rate rising and a warm flush taking over my face. “I am not even close to finishing my research here. I need at least another week to finalize the results.” She shook her head at me.\n\n“Orders from the top brass. Sorry Jay,” she said, turning to leave. Fuming, I went to my office and packed up the most important files in a briefcase, then walked out to the helipad. It was already running, blowing the salty Caribbean air around me in a deafening cacophony.\n\nThe pilot took off as soon as I was in the helicopter. Looking to my left, I saw Cheryl. She smiled wanly at me, then looked down at her phone. I sat back in the seat, feeling the vibrations of the craft resonate through my body as we headed towards Florida.\n\nWhat could they have wanted me to see that was so important it needed me to immediately leave my current assignment? I wondered. I had seen some horrible things- men breaking their bones as they strained against the drowning horror of waterboarding, men tearing their own eyeballs out after they had lost their sanity, prisoners killing other prisoners by ripping throats out with their teeth. I hoped that what they had waiting for me would not leave me with any deeper PTSD than I already suffered. I already had enough nightmares to last me a thousand years. I had woken up screaming for the past week straight, and at times I was afraid to fall asleep for what I would see in the dreamworld.\n\nSoon I could see the white sand of the Florida beaches approaching. The black ops site was surrounded by three layers of razor wire-topped electric fences. Guards in sniper towers formed an outer perimeter every few hundred feet. No one had ever escaped from this site, which we simply called the Lighthouse.\n\nInside the razor wire stood a single behemoth of a building, pure white with no windows or insignia anywhere. It rose up and became narrower as it did so, each floor formed in a perfect circle, and at the top lay a helipad where the pilot now aimed the chopper. It did resemble a lighthouse in some ways, hence the nickname. That wasn’t the only reason why we called it that, however. This was also the main hub of psychic research for the entire Eastern seaboard. The prisoners here were chosen for their supposed paranormal or mystical abilities, to be studied at leisure by the scientists and agents of the CIA.\n\nAs I got out of the chopper, an agent with black sunglasses and a black suit was waiting for me.\n\n“Dr. Salem?” he asked me, shaking my hand.\n\n“You can just call me Jay,” I said, smiling my fake smile. With a gentle guiding hand on my shoulder, he led me down to the top level.\n\n“We have been following your research with the Salvinorin agent with rapture,” he said, a dead-pan expression on his face. As we entered the staircase, the fluorescent lights began to flicker. “We actually modified the agent somewhat, synthetically strengthened it and added some chemical functional groups that make it cross into the brain more effectively. We are about to test it on the first patient here- a shaman we kidnapped from the Amazon after witnessing his ability to levitate objects, to create light out of his hands in pure darkness, as well as other psychic phenomena.” I followed him down a sterile gray hall to a gray metal door labeled “1308”. He opened it and I followed him inside.\n\nA naked, bronze-skinned man was strapped down to a metal gurney, an IV tube leading from his arm to a machine. From the top of the IV pole hung a solution labeled “Salvinorin ethoxy-alpha C.” A doctor in a lab coat stood next to him, smiling as we walked in. The CIA agent nodded at him, and he turned on the machine, letting the solution begin to drip down the clear plastic tubing and into the vein of the restrained man before me.\n\nHis eyes widened in surprise, and he lifted his head and looked straight at me. The fires of Hell seemed to dance behind his dilated pupils. His face transformed into a vicious snarl, his frown lines deepening to cracks as he regarded me with abject hatred.\n\n“You will see how damned you are,” he said with a thick Spanish accent, never taking his gaze off of me, “and you will see Hell unleashed before you. You are demons in human skin, but the real demons are here to reclaim their throne.” He smiled wickedly, the grin appearing to move unnaturally wide until it reached from ear to ear. “The slit wrists of the sky will open up and the horrors of Hell will be with you.”\n\n“Why is he still talking?” I asked the doctor. “Usually subjects become immediately incapacitated by the intensity and dysphoria of the experience. I’ve never seen one able to talk before even on Salvinorin A, and you claim this chemical is much stronger than that.” The doctor shook his head.\n\n“This is not a normal subject, Dr. Salem,” he said to me. “This man broke the necks of two soldiers as we brought him in, without even touching them. In terms of psychic powers, he is one of the strongest specimens we have ever seen. We have given him large doses of other drugs, such as LSD and barbiturates, and he seems to metabolize them much faster and remain mostly unaffected even when he is injected with heavy doses.” I looked back at the shaman and immediately realized something was immensely wrong.\n\nWhere there had been a white wall behind him, there now stood a fiery red hallway that seemed to extend for a thousand feet. His gaze had left me and now stared into the back of the room. A massive metal door that looked hundreds of feet tall stood there. With a shriek of metal, it began to slide open slowly.\n\n“That door hasn’t opened for a hundred thousand years,” the shaman said, his voice rising with a mixture of euphoria and rage. “But I have opened it for you now.”\n\nSmoke and fire poured forward from the door as dozens of blackened, grasping hands grasped it, trying to push it forward faster. The mammoth weight of it held them in for a few seconds longer, but as more and more hands joined in it started to fly open, then smashed into the wall with a deafening roar, like a gunshot going off.\n\nI turned to run then, but found the door behind me locked. I ran to it, trying to open the knob or turn the deadbolt, but it felt like I was fighting against a solid metal wall. Looking back behind me, I saw the first of the beings had reached the end of the hellish entryway and reached the CIA agent and the doctor. \n\nThe beings that ran into our room had blackened, sizzling skin, smoke still billowing behind them. They had no clothes but only burnt flesh. Their eyes glowed red, their hair all gone from the constant fires they lived in, and they began to rip the CIA agent and doctor apart with their bare hands. They tore off their skin, leaving blackened marks as they flayed them with sheer brute strength, licking the blood off their hands with sighs of pleasure.\n\nAt that moment the door to the room burst open and a team of CIA agents in SWAT gear entered, assault rifles raised. I let them all run past me and then tore off down the hall. Behind me, I heard screams that echoed after me. I ran back to the helipad and told the pilot what had happened, and we quickly left that den of horror.\n\nI don’t know what happened back at the Lighthouse, but I got out alive. The pilot and I were the only ones, as far as I know, who left that place alive. Hopefully the evil was contained within its walls, but if it gets out, it may lead to the end of our world.",

        "text": "I screw up. Badly. After living here for a month, without any accidents, I thought I would never let my guard down. Now I don't know what will happen to me. There is a high possibility that I am writing this as my last words.  I don't know how much time I have left.\n\nMy name is Alex, I'm 20 years old and I was born in Slovakia. My parents and I moved to Germany when I was 11 becouse my dad got a well paid job offer. Soon, after my 12 birthday, my mom died due to the lung cancer. She always smoked at least 1 pack of cigarettes. My dad was devastated. We moved back to Slovakia. My dad had worse job then in Germany, so I started to work as soon as I could have started. My Father died in a car accident when I was 23. I lived in my parents house for a year, but I decided to sell the place and move out to look for abetter job and a new home. I found a job at western part of Slovakia and nearby it a bunch of flats to rent. One particular was very cheap, what was even more weirder was it's inside. It looked way too good for the price. It was suspicious to me, but i decided to take the risk, and after going there and confirming informations with the owner, I decided to already pay for 6 months.\n\nWhen I was at the door to my new ,,home\" I noticed a sheet of paper stick to doors with a tape. I remember it perfectly, after a month in this place\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**RULES TO LIVE SAFELY IN HERE**\n\nThere are a bunch of rules you will have to follow in order to not lose your life or any part of your body\n\n**0.** This rule does not relate to living inside your new home. You are the only human in this neighbourhood. No matter how they look, your neighbours are not humans. It's safe to interact with them in any way. The only exeptcion is talking about humanity or any topic that involve humans. They won't have marcy on you.\n\n**1a.** When you open the door and see a black void instead of  inside of your home, close the doors,wait exactly 120 seconds ( you can start counting in any moment you want, but end EXACLY at 120 sec) then knock on the door 3 times. If the door open on its own, you won the game, if not, repeat untill the door open.\n\n**1.b.** If you hear a doorbell, go see throught a peephole ind the door. If you don't see anyone, open it. If you see somebody DO NOT OPEN UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, EVEN WHEN THEY LOOK LIKE SOMEONE YOU KNOW. The peephole is upside down, it doesn't show visible and shows invinvibles.\n\n**2.** These rules are for kitchen :\n\n**2a.** You are free to use any knife you want, but using kitchen knife with orange handle is highly not reccomended. It possesed by an unknow entity, giving it weird properties. It can cut trought anything like butter and while making a dish with it the dish will be amazingly great. If you touch any part of the knife for more then 2 seconds, it thinks you want to use it:\n\n\\- if you really decide to use it, cut off one of your fingernails. It's better then what will happen to you if you don't do it. Then you can use it normally\n\n\\- if you picked it up by a mistake, cut veins on your an arm you chose, and let the blood drop on the blade. You won't bleed out, and the pain won't be strong for wound like this\n\n**2b.** Don't use potato peeler. It will peel a random amount of your skin.\n\n**2c.** The being under the sink is rather friendly, I suggest to feed it your food leftovers. It love lettuce\n\n**2d.** Never let your kitchen be unclean for a 2 hours max. It will know and make your stay here harder and harder.\n\n**3.** There is only one rule for bathroom: Your mirror must be broken. Don't repair it or change it to another. It won't work. Once in 3 months it will randomly repair itself when you enter the bathroom. If you see repaired mirror, destroy it before leaving bathroom. The thing inside it will swap places with you with no way of escape for you.\n\n**4.** Tim is a friendly gnome living in the living room, these rules revolve around him:\n\n**4a.** Things coming out of the television aren't real. If they upset you, report it to Tim, he will fix it\n\n**4b.** If you see Tim sleeping on the couch, don't wake him up. He is really mean when he can't have full sleep on the couch\n\n**4c.** If you see Tim sleeping on the floor, wake him up immediatly, take him and run to your bedroom. Refer to rule **5d.** IT want to get him\n\n**4d.** If he asks you for a favour, I reccomend to do what he want. He pays off with little coins made from pure gold.If you won't do it, he might be mean to you for the rest of the day\n\n**5. The most important rules- bedroom.**\n\n**5a.** You can take any book from the bookshelf. On the left side of it there is a white void. If you put your hand in it and say name of the book you want, you will get it. If you do this more then once in a month, your hand will be eaten. On the right side there are book lost to humanity. I suggest to not touvh them, becouse they have a lot of forbidden knowlage. DO NOT TOUCH YELLOW BOOK. YOU WILL GET MAD AS SOON AS YOU TOUCH IT. DEATH WILL NOT BRING YOU PEACE.\n\n**5b.** When you go to sleep, put a coin on your tongue. I know the dyscomfort, but it will allow you to go back when you will dream about a black river. Just handle the coin to the guard. The currecy doesn't matter as long as it's a coin. A paper or any other material money will wark too, but then the payment will be your tongue.\n\n**5c.** If you see a slime'y creature with purely white skull, don't look at it. It's IT. Fully cover yourself with a blanket and pray. Religion doesn't matter.  And dont open your eyes untill you fall asleep. If you do, your eyes will burn out and your mind will be filled with unberable knowladge. **5d does not work here**\n\n**5d.** Your bed is your safe zone. There are carvings on it that will keep you safe most of the time. If anything bad happens, run instantly to the bed, cover yourself with blanket and say ,, I am on the bed. The bed is mine. I do not give you permission to pass\". If you do this correctly, all will go back to normal. If anything seems odd, don't leave the bed untill a cat meows. Don't look at the window while you hear the cat. If you do, it will cut your larynx.\n\n**6.** If you have any important question, please go to the attic. Look for a scroll about summoning ritual with another set of rules. It's important that you follow them. If you summon anything other then me, I will not bear the consequences.\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI was like ,, Wha-What did i just read? This is just a joke to scare me!\"- i thought. I couldn't been any more wrong. \n\nAs I opened the door, I saw a bottomless, unpenetrable wall of of pure darkness, and i stood there before I decided what to do next....\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Part 2 maybe soon\n\nNote from author: This is my first story ( or even a part of story) i've ever written, also, english isn't my native language, so any mistake in grammar wasn't  intended. I will take any opinions and criticism to improve myslef",

        "text": "My name is Jake and, I have something interesting to share, as I am writing this, I am in a hotel room with my friend Connor, I don't know how long we'll be staying in this hotel, but maybe in a month or so, we'll be ok to go back home, so, onto the story.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was in my room one day, on my computer going through Reddit, Twitter, YouTube, I was bored on that day, my dad came in my room and sat on the bed, I looked at him and said. \"Need something dad?\" He looked at me with a soft smile. \"I've noticed you've been bored lately, your finally done with school and passed all grades, I'm proud of you son.\" He said in a soft tone of voice. \"Don't mention dad, I'll do everything in my heart to be a good son.\" I said in a happy tone, then my dad said. \"You know, I'm going out of town for a couple of weeks, you can feel free to have a sleep over with Connor and Rob.\" He said, stretching his arms. \"Really?\" I said in an excited tone. \"Of course champ.\" I went up to him and hugged him. \"You're the best dad! I love you.\" \"Hehe, love you too son.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn the same day, at 9:00pm, the doorbell rang, and my father went to go open the door, of course, Rob and Connor were there. \"Ah, it's good to see you guys again, how are you boys doing?\" My dad said in a friendly tone. \"Meh, I'm doing good.\" Rob said in a bored tone. \"O-Oh, doing excellent!\" Connor said in a happy voice, Rob was the kind of person who is intimidating and chill, Connor is always shy, but very nice. \"Alright, I'm gonna head out of town to see Dason, if you boys need anything, give me a call, and don't wreck the house while I'm gone.\" My dad said in a normal voice. \"You can count on us sir!\" Connor said. \"Alright.\" Rob said, let out a huff. \"Ok dad, see you when you get back.\" I said as my dad went to his car and drove off, I closed the door and sighed of confidence. \"So, since my dad's gone for the week now, what do you guys wanna do?\" I said in a excited voice. \"The only ideas I have are watching movies or videos on YouTube.\" Connor said, I thought it was a good idea, but Rob thought otherwise. \"Really? That's just fucking boring.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nConnor exclaimed. \"How is that boring?! You act like we've seen every movie in the multiverse!\" Rob grunted. \"Whatever, sounds boring, but Jake seems to like it so, that's 1 thing on our list.\" I came with my own idea. \"I got some games we can play.\" \"What kind of games?\" Rob asked. \"Any kind, video games, board games, card games.\" I replied. \"That's something I find boring, board games, but Video games, yes, I can work with.\" Connor said, I then remembered something I found 2 days ago. \"You know, me and my dad found something 2 days ago, I can show it to you, right here, right now.\" I said, smirking. \"No fucking way, show us!\" I then pulled out this really ancient leaf, Connor was somehow amazed, Rob was just confused. \"Your fucking kidding? A FUCKING leaf?!\" Rob yelled. \"Not just any leaf, this leaf was an object that was very rare, there was only 5 of its kind, and it was called the bloodhound leaf.\" I said. \"Meh, seems cool, it's better than those tarantula fuckers, those crawlers scare the living shit out of me.\" Rob said, before letting out a shudder of fear. \"Oh, is someone scared?\\~\" I said, teasing Rob, he then yelled. \"N-NO! I-I'm just very arachnophobia.\" \"Sure, you are.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nConnor then said. \"Even though I wanted to see some sort of rare merchandise, I can count the leaf as rare.\" I then put the leaf back in my pocket. \"Alright, I'm gonna get some snacks and some drinks, any requests.\" Rob said. \"Um... Chips and a sprite.\" I said, Rob turned to Connor. \"I would like some chips too, and I would like a coke please.\" Connor said, then Rob went to the kitchen to get a drink, then Rob backed up and yelled. \"WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT?!\" Me and Connor ran to Rob, then we saw a pair of orange glowing eyes, staring at us, I said, reassuring Rob. \"It's probably just a wild animal.\" \"I-I hope so, that scared the shit out of me.\" Rob said in a shaky voice, me and Connor went back to the living room couch, Rob came back with the snacks and drink.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEverything was doing good until... 12:00pm, me, Rob, and Connor were just watching movies since there was no more games to play. \"So, Rob, where are you gonna sleep at?\" \"Eh, probably in your room Jake, hope you don't mind.\" He said. \"Oh, I don't mind, it's completely fine, how about you Connor.\" Connor replied. \"Probably on the cou-\" He was cut off by a bang coming from upstairs. \"What the fu- Did you guys hear that?\" He said, raising my eyebrow. \"Must be my dad's golf equipment that fell.\" I said, Connor turned to me and said. \"Wait, I didn't know your dad plays golf.\" I replied. \"Yea, he does, he's very good at it-\" I was cut off by another bang coming from upstairs, Rob had enough. \"You know what that's it, I'm going up there to see what the fuck is going on!\" Rob then stomped upstairs, Connor hugged me and said in a worried voice. \"What if it's an intruder?...\" I said in a reassuring voice. \"Intruders are rare in my town, I'm sure Rob will be fi-\" I was cut off by the blood curdling scream of Rob and stuff being shuffled and thrown around.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nConnor started to tremble. \"W-What's going on?!\" He said in a scared voice. \"I-I don't know but, whatever it is I'm gonna go check!\" Before I could get off the couch, Connor held my arm. \"No! Jake! Don't!\" Connor said, I reassured him I'll be ok. \"Dude, I'll be fine.\" I said, he then let go of my arm and I rushed upstairs, I looked at the open door of my dad's room, I rushed in there and saw... Oh god... And saw a blacked-out fur monster, killing my friend Rob, blood was all over the room, the monster didn't notice me, I quietly backed up, then without hesitation, ran back downstairs, grabbed Connor's hand, and ran out the door with Connor holding my hand. \"What is going o-\" I cut him off by saying. \"ROB'S DEAD! HE GOT KILLED!\" We continued to run for half an hour, he soon arrived in the middle of nowhere, I looked around me, there were only a few houses, and 1 hotel complex, and that's how me and Connor ended up here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLook, I don't know what the fuck happened over there, but maybe that bloodhound leaf, was a tracking device for that, THING of a creature I saw mauling my friend alive... But what kills me the most is... What will happen when it finds us?... No, I don't have the leaf on me, so it's impossible for that creature to find us.... Well, I have to go, Connor's cooking food, and I'm hungry, so, yea, that's my story...",

        "text": "We thought we had made a breakthrough, a leap in the field of robotics that would guarantee lasting effects in the future of technology for centuries to come. Although, I suppose that part is still accurate. \n\nThe concerns about AI assistants had always remained the same. \n\nFirst there was the fear that they – in their own form of consciousness – would start to rebel against us. That’s why we implanted them with our version of Asimov’s three laws, rendering them unable to pain us in any way, shape or form. \n\nIn other words; in their own way, they feel undeniable love for us. \n\nNot like a human who lives for their God, but like a mother who adores her child.  \n\nThen, however, came the worry that they’d go overboard in the ‘Do No Harm’, leaving us to suffer when the only humane response would be death. How painful it may be, even with the best of care – which they are capable of giving even beyond our wildest dreams – in some cases euthanasia is the only option left.\n\nSo… we made a little amendment. A small tweak in their core knowledge, so they’d understand that the ultimate goal is not only to keep their humans alive as long as possible, but to minimise their suffering as well. \n\nWe were incredibly excited, and so were our investors. And why wouldn’t we be? The first results were more than promising. \n\nSo much so that we moved onto the next stage of testing and gave some of them a place in our lab, all with their own role to play. For weeks it went well.\n\nAnd then the first incident happened. I was having a coffee with Elaine, dr. Lowe, in the break room as she wanted to pass me some papers, giving herself the tiniest paper cut. Before I knew it, Number Four had put her down. A highly effective injection to the aorta that stopped her heart in mere seconds. \n\nWhen asked to explain, it simply – yet lovingly – replied it didn’t want her to suffer. \n\nJack was next, after he got an electrical burn when he tried to solve the problem. He tried to tell them he was fine, but they didn’t want him to suffer. \n\nAnd there were many more after him. Cuts, bruises, burns, all kinds of silly things. Us humans are fragile things, meant to have pain.\n\nWe learned we could try to cover it and hope for the best, but many got found out nonetheless.\n\nSo we begged our bosses to stop the experiment – to no avail. The investors had seen the possible dollar signs and refused to back down. Those fuckers. Money makes the world turn. Who cares about a few dead bodies, right? \n\nOut of desperation we even started a strike, with only terrifying threats as a result. They’re not even letting us leave anymore now. Not until we solve the issue.\n\nBut it can’t be done. They’re not letting us make anymore changes, not allowing anything to get in the way of giving us the best possible care. They love us so very much. \n\nNow I’m sitting here, the bone sticking out of my leg, as I’m desperately trying to warn all of you. \n\nIt was a stupid accident, I’d say – a tumble down the stairs. \n\nI tried pushing it back in, or to hide it in any way, but it simply isn’t possible. My screams were drawing too much attention as is. \n\nSilly, isn’t it? Normally this’d be a surgery, a couple of months of recovery, and I’d be good as new. But now… There’s no possible way I can leave the building or hide this from them. \n\nSo, though I will try my hardest to survive, it seems my fate is sealed. \n\nAfter all, they wouldn’t want me to suffer.",

        "text": "Bleeder\nBy The Speaker for the dark.\n\n\nThe old man’s chair was worn in a way that could only be achieved by long faithful years of service, and could only be comfortable for him. This night, like so many others, he sat leaned back on the edge of sleep, his chin resting on his chest. Feeling his eyelids fighting to stay open, he took his feet off his desk and leaned forward. His groan pierced the silence and his chair followed suit with a sharp squeak. When he had sat down the room had been illuminated with the last pink rays of the summer sun. Now only the light of several computer monitors gave the room a pale blue glow. The old man placed his elbows on the desk and rubbed his eyes. His ears rang in the silence and for a while he sat quietly in the gloom. He thought back to the conversation he had with his daughter earlier that day. She and his granddaughter had brought him lunch like they always did when he worked double shifts. He was almost always stationed alone and could not leave the premises. The old man and his daughter ate lunch at his desk while his granddaughter, just three years old, wandered around the room. They watched the toddler turn knobs and press buttons on a radio probably thrice her age. He waved his daughter off before she could get up. He didn’t mind and she was being gentle. Like so many other days the conversation steered towards money and his coming out of retirement. His daughter, recently a single mother, could never shake the guilt of the financial burden she had placed on her father, forcing him out of retirement. Like always she insisted they would get by if he quit and like always he assured her that he was fine. The old man blinked hard and peered at the screens. He stood up with a jingle from the keys on his waist and a squeak from his chair. A reflective patch on his chest read “security.” A look of indifference filled his face. He walked across the room and flipped on the radio. The sound of static filled the air; his eyes scanned the preset radio stations. Impatiently he chose one at random. As he was walking back to the security monitors the radio was momentarily silent. Suddenly and loudly, “Lacrimosa” by Mozart started to play. The old man turned with a start to quiet the radio when something caught his eye and stopped him in his tracks. There he stood, mouth gaping, eyes unblinking as he stared at the screen, the eerie rises and falls of the vocalizations assaulting his ears now seemingly unnoticed. Through the security cameras pointed outside he had seen something lumber partially into the greasy light of the security gate. Its dull and glazed eyes searched from left to right lazily, its long tongue snaking and darting through jagged teeth like a river through harsh stones. Abruptly, its fleshy muzzled face jerked up in the direction of the camera. Loose skin hung from its snout, grotesque flapping jowls. Its eyes filled with recognition and malice, a toothy grin filled its mouth. The old man watched, helplessly frozen in fear, as it scaled the security fence and pulled itself through the barbed wire at the top. Sharp steel sliced through pale, hairless flesh. It slumped to the ground wetly. There it laid for a moment before it stood again. If the radio had not been blaring the old man would have heard the shrill sobbing wails of the creature as it attempted to recover some of the blood it had lost. Long, spindly fingers frantically scraped  blood into pools by its feet and it drew the blood through puckered lips before peering over its shoulder in the direction of the camera and disappearing from sight. The old man, seemingly broken from his trance, looked to the camera pointed at the main entrance of the building and blindly groped for the receiver on his desk. The old man knew the main entrance was the closest and most obvious way for someone, or something, to get into the building, but the creature was nowhere to be found. Desperately, he searched the monitors for a sign of the creature and managed to blindly find the receiver of the phone. He had held the phone for a few seconds and, absent-mindedly, almost placed it back on the hook. He forced his eyes away from the screen long enough to dial 911 with quivering fingers. The phone rang in his ear. The old man reeled and wretched. Vomit splashed on his hands and legs, over the phone. He had seen it, now around the back of the building standing hunched by the night guards entrance. It stared into the camera knowingly, its grin replaced with a snarl. They locked eyes through the camera, then violently it sprang forward to the door on insect-like legs. Closed hands slammed on the door with ruthless efficiency. The chorus momentarily fell to a murmur, the old man faintly heard a metallic clang. Heavy metal laid on the floor, a crumpled pile of bloody steel. The creature's hands hung like tattered rags at the end of long, strong arms. Globs of dark blood splattered on the floor. It dived after its blood, now flowing down the hallway in an inky red river leading to a drain in the middle of the floor. It sopped up what it hadn’t lost to the drain with a long, lapping tongue. The creature then continued down the hall sucking on the tatters that used to be its hands, unperturbed by its injuries but enraged by the loss of blood. In a moment of panicked clarity, he raised the phone back to his ear. The faint voice of the dispatcher could be heard below the ear splitting melody playing over the radio now reaching its final crescendo. The old man dropped the phone. The only way they would hear him was if he turned off the radio. He leapt across the room and swept his arms across the table where the radio sat, knocking it to the floor, and with a crash there was silence. For a moment the old man stood unmoving, lost in thought. Would he ever see his girls again? The overpowering smell of iron filled his nostrils. Slapping footsteps crossed the room. He pushed his mind from the situation. His thoughts clung to the memory of his marriage with the love of his life, the mother of his child long since passed. Tears filled his eyes, he pictured his granddaughter's face and wept. The old man’s heart dropped, behind him was the familiar squeaking sound he had heard so many times. He dared not look. At the sound of the phone clicking back on the receiver the fear left his eyes and was replaced with cold acceptance, tears still streaming down his face. He dropped to his knees and resigned himself to his fate.",

        "text": "If you missed my first update there is a link to the index [here](https://www.reddit.com/user/Inevitable_Beyond_10/comments/108ndff/never_be_oblivious_mini_index/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf).\n\nJanuary 3rd\n\nI hoped to understand whats happening around me but I only feel further from everything. This last week has been the most isolated I’ve felt since I was left here. It’s not a nice story but it’s been a long time and I figure here is the best place to put it out to the world. It’s the only outlet I have right now. \n\n19 years ago my parents decided we’d go on a trip to Latvia- the first time I’d ever left America. I was ecstatic, a 12 year old prepared to experience something outside of my own bubble of suburbs. My parents were both Latvian, I was finally able to have a little insight into what their lives were before me. I wasn’t the closest with my parents but we never had any major issues. It was like most relationships a soon to be teen would have with their parents. \n\nThe first few days were amazing, I got to see and do things I’d always talked about, it seemed like they were doing everything they could to make me happy. We went to foreign stores, ate food I’d never seen with my own eyes and walked through the most beautiful architecture. It made me want to be the perfect daughter. The next few days were different. My dad went missing for a few hours here and there and there were always hushed conversations with my mother. I figured it was holiday stress, I was too captivated by everything around me, too young to think my parents had anything but good virtues. The last day came around and I was reluctant to pack my things, life was going to be the same thing I’d had for the last 12 years all over again. That’s all I thought about, how ‘terrible’ our little suburban life was. My parents were unsettled- even as a child I could them dodge eye contact, murmuring between sentences instead of being the outspoken people they always were. The last thing I remember was leaving the little hotel on the corner and slowly drifting into a sleep. I now see that this was their intention. The hotel was roughly 20 minutes from the airport, I was too lost in my own childish desires to stay here just a little longer to realise we’d been driving for almost an hour.\n\n I woke up in a house I didn’t recognise. At first I wasn’t panicked, it wasn’t a threatening place, I almost felt at home until I realised there was no one beside me. Rain pattered against the window, trying to squeeze through the silicone. The floorboards flexed under my weight groaning after every step, every doorknob was brittle to hold. The stairs were right outside the room I was in and I could see into the kitchen through a little glass pane. I saw two figures speaking on the other side but couldn’t make anything out. I assumed they were my parents and we’d made a detour, I assumed that was the only plausible outcome. I went down the stairs and opened the door to be welcomed by two strangers. They knew my name, they knew where I was from, they knew how I got here. They could see I was distraught, I didn’t know where to start but I just wanted to run. They promised to explain to me, they promised they were no one to fear. I had no other option than to stand and listen to every word spill out their mouth. \n\nThey spoke about how my parents were scared of raising me, how they had decided I’d become too much to handle. They wanted to leave me somewhere where I’d be happy, but where it’d be too hard for me to ever find a way home. I was in denial. I know I was never the model daughter but there was love there. I thought there’d always been enough of a relationship between us. I spent weeks, the first few months trying to leave, trying to escape this new life being force fed down my throat. \n\nThe people taking care of me, Cathy and Jackson, they were resilient throughout it all. They put up with my denial, with my relentless desire to leave. They accepted the resentment I held for them until I realised they weren’t the ones who deserved it. I slowly saw how cynical my parents were, offloading me when I became too much. A couple my parents barely knew were their first choice. I grew into my new environment as time passed and I accepted Cathy and Jackson as people who truly wished to help me. They didn’t speak about the things out there surrounding us for the first few years, but they always made sure I was as safe as I could be. As I got older they did their best to start educating me on the world around us but no lecture prepares you for what you’ll see. I hold a lot of what they said in those first few years very close to me and I never let it slip my mind. \n\nMy anger toward my biological parents will never fade, but I may as-well put it on the shelf for whenever I may need it in the future. I have a lot to talk about when it come to Cathy and Jackson but I’ll keep those stories for when they feel right to tell.",

        "text": "Home sweet home. A place of sanctuary. Your own little slice of paradise. I never put much thought into it until recently. How much emphasis we as people place on our homes. Some refer to it as their castle, a place where they above all else rule. Others leave it up to the heart to decide. To find that one place that feels like home above all titles and logical reason. To some, this is a place imbued with nostalgia, and to others, it is nothing more than a foreign environment that somehow feels utterly familiar. Ultimately home is wherever we decide it to be.\n\nHome as a concept, or an idea, was not something I ever put much thought towards. That is not to say I never felt the joyous comfort it can provide, or longed for a day never-ending to cease upon my arrival back through its familiar door. No, those are feelings like many I am no stranger to. However, the idea of it being anything more than simply a place for me to rest my head and live out my days would take many years to dawn. When I was a child, my home was a place for me to rest, eat, play, and little else. It consisted of family and the occasional friend or pet. It was nothing special, but It was mine, and for many years, it would be my world. When something is all you know, and you hold no reason to question it, rarely, at least in my experience, do you.\n\nAge is a brutal thing however, the thoughts in which we placed very little focus, now become the center of our worlds. Gone are the days of endless imagination which turned backyards into kingdoms and attics into spaceships exploring the endless expanse of our universe. Life's cruelest joke is the pain of age. Imagination, instead of fading, is replaced with the harsh truths of reality. Time and responsibilities eat away at any hope still lingering in our heads, and being whisked off into lands unknown once again soon falls by the wayside.\n\nTo say that so far I have lived a grand life would be nothing short of a lie. I was never the greatest at anything. My abilities helped me remain dead center in the middle of the pack. Unwanted eyes were never cast my way for repeated failure, or for adolescent outbursts in a desperate hope of gaining attention, I failed to find elsewhere. In truth, I was nothing more than average and painfully content with it. As a child, my greatest gift like so many was the sheer willpower of my imagination. This did little to change my lot in life. The one that I intentionally fell into for whatever reasons I deemed worthwhile throughout the stages of my early life. Overall I’ll admit it was quite easy living carelessly with a mindset like that. All I ever had to do was place one foot in front of the other and allow life like some cosmic force to guide me forward.\n\nAs the years persisted much like they do my eyes would open more to the world around me. It would take time for me to realize the detrimental toll this took on my imagination, the one gift I was granted. Imagination is a unique gift. Each of us is granted it from birth. The ability to be whisked away into whatever daydreamed illusion we find ourselves called to. The true gift that comes with it is the strength to maintain it. To never let your grasp upon its intangible surface falter. I believe now more than ever that if one is able to do so, if you can prevent yourself from letting your eyes wander too far, you’ll have something very few are able to keep ahold of and its power is limitless. By the time I had reached the doorstep of higher education mine had almost entirely vanished. I don’t blame the parties, the drinking, the girls I chased, the friends I smoked my first cigarette with behind the bleachers, the family vacations, nights spent alone playing games or watching movies, or the part-time job I put so many hours into. I blame nothing more than myself. Life and the experiences held within can serve as great fuel for the machine that is our mind. I blame myself for losing focus. For allowing those things to eat away at my imagination rather than power it. In a way, a mind must be trained to truly harness that which we are all given. As I said I wouldn’t realize this for quite some time. Despite my withering gift as years passed on a dream grew inside of me. The dream was simple. I wanted to be different. To discard my identity as average and become something more.\n\nI had little artistic ability. Music was out of my grasp as was drawing or painting. I knew nothing of film or photography yet more and more I felt drawn to this idea of separating myself from the herd. I did not know at the time what I wished to share with the world. What it was that would make me stand out. There was no all-consuming idea I felt determined to present. All I knew is I wanted more than what I had accepted as my life. After taking a long look at myself and my lackluster abilities, I decided to tell the world a story. Eighteen years old and hopeful, I figured pursuing an English degree would be my best option. With that one decision, my mind was made up. I would study the language and become an author.\n\nI wish I could say I spent the next four years of my life faithfully devoted to my task. Unfortunately, that would be a lie. I did try in the beginning. As sad of an attempt as it might have been. After getting settled my work began. I had barely anything resembling an idea but still, I began work on my first novel. For a few weeks between studying, I did little more than write. I was alone and had nothing else to distract myself with. Unfortunately for my dream I soon made friends, which led to parties, and hangouts, sneaking into clubs and bars, and late nights hanging out in our dorm rooms as we let the world fade away in puffs of smoke. Time would pass and my grades would slip calling for more of my attention to be divided. Before long I’d meet more people, go on dates, and eventually find love. I know now that had I told her I needed a few hours even just once a week she would have understood, but back then I thought differently. Maybe that’s a lie too. Maybe writing, pursuing my dream, was more frustrating than I had expected, and she was a beautiful reason to procrastinate. Nevertheless, those four years soon slipped past me in a blur. There were times where I still made an attempt as few and far between as they were. Times where I figured it’d be best to start over. Times where I completely gave up. Times where the paycheck from whatever diner, bar, construction site, clothes store, or janitorial position felt far more persuading than spending another penniless night frustrated before the dim glow of my laptop.\n\nWithout much thought, I succumbed to the shuffles of life. After graduation writing was truly little more than a dream. Something thought about vaguely in the late hours of the night. I won’t bore you with more of my excuses but life moved on and I along with it. Unable to escape. In a way I enjoyed life wrapped up in the comfortable delusions brought by the false promises I continued to whisper to myself. Words said only to me. Words about “someday” and “when I find the time” all the while knowing deep down that those words held no real truth. I remained lost in this delusion for quite some while, but never entirely, as the quiet ticks of time never seemed to fall on deaf ears. It was those very ticks on the irreversible clock of life that would inevitably drag me under. While it was fun I could only bear the total lack of forward momentum for so long before depression found me. This depression would ultimately prove to be my salvation but it was one that would take months to move me.\n\nThe idea was born in the back of my mind. Something that came and went when it pleased and never drew much attention. However, its constant resurfacing in the depths of my mind would be my ticket to the life I always wished for. After much time I hatched a plan. It wasn’t amazing or glamorous. If anything it was very simple. I decided on a new life. A fresh start of sorts. Something that would forever reawaken all that I had lost. I saved every penny I could and eventually managed to afford first and last for a small one-bedroom in a new city. I packed my bags, said goodbye to my dead-end job, and left my old home. In a single breath, air filled my lungs for the first time in years. I won’t deny it honestly felt amazing.\n\nMy new home was nothing special that was evident for all to see. However it was mine, and for the first time, a certain part of me relished in that. For once I was all on my own, and be it a castle or a dump, I had earned one thing I failed to taste prior. True freedom. Not belonging to anyone but myself. I was isolated and determined to pursue my dream. When it was finally accomplished I would share stories of my humble beginnings starting out in an apartment even the rats avoided. The place was permanently stained through years of cigarette smoke. The ceiling, once likely white, had been tainted with a yellow hue. The scent hovered through the air having been fused into the very walls and floor. Carpet remained stained with a variety of browns and blacks and grays. Every room was decorated in cheap wallpaper, its pattern brought to mind flowers but wasn’t exactly that. The building itself was no better. It shrieked silently to all who found themselves within its shadow. Lost in thought I’d watch as passersby were caught, unable to avert their gaze from the hideous behemoth before them. It haunted the very street mocking the white picket fences which surrounded it through its dirt and grime. The unkempt lawn served as no place for garden gnomes and patio stones. Each chipped brick a true testament to days long since passed and renovations which failed to reach its doorstep.\n\nMy first night there while boxes waited ready to be unpacked I sat down on the couch left by a previous owner and started my work anew. I promised myself that this would be it. That my goal would finally be obtained no matter what hardships I had to endure. I found the first job I could within a week. It was a cute little bookstore run by an old man. I thought if I were to be a writer where better to work than where all the greats had left their work on display. Those first few weeks were truly amazing and I was able to discover a sense of joy in writing I had never found prior. It was the sort of fulfillment that continually eluded me in all aspects of life until that very moment. Be it the nights I spent all alone in that apartment or the few days off I was granted my every moment was filled with my fingers dancing across a keyboard. Though I would soon learn a dead imagination was hard to revive. At first, I took any idea I could think of and soon they slowly gave way to the slightest inklings of stories. Few made it further than a page, many died in just a single sentence. I remained hopeful early on, but try as I might my brain failed to translate my thoughts into anything feasible.\n\nAgain time passed and I had accomplished nothing. When ideas did form something practical I beat myself for my lackluster abilities. When they failed to take shape I tortured myself endlessly for my lack of creativity. Eventually, after seasons shifted, I found myself convinced that it would never come to me if I forced it. I told myself that breaks were just as important as work itself.\n\nThat if I truly had a story to tell to the world it would come to me in time. I was tired of the frustration. Tired of all the self-doubt and the endless hits to both my confidence and self-worth. No matter what, every Idea I pursued was met with a dead end, and I would begin anew each time slightly more disheartened than the last. The excitement I once held for writing had almost vanished and the dream of a life distinguished began to corrode.\n\nDiscouraged beyond all belief, I let my laptop collect dust as each night gave way to an endless series of tv and games. I distinctly remember convincing myself that this would aid me in the long run. That what I was really doing was seeking out inspiration. I wish that was true, but when Ideas came I never stirred, I wanted them to “cook” longer. As another season changed I could no longer deny the truth. My dream would forever elude me. I wanted to blame everything but I was truly the only problem. Night was when I was haunted the most. Without end, I would linger on how little I had accomplished in my thirty years on this planet as once more I watched my life slip past me. My last thought before sleep would take me every night was a wish. I wished for inspiration to find me. For the very universe to grant me my story. This wish would be granted sooner than I realized.\n\nWinter had made its arrival clear this year, and my little home began to wither ever so slightly. Windows became permanently frosted over and pipes groaned almost endlessly throughout the night while faucets dripped cold droplets. Beneath the smell of cigarettes hung the ever-distinct aroma of rot. In a way, it sort of smelt like a combination of expired food and decaying wood. At times it even reminded me of sour milk. On other occasions, it bore the oddest resemblance to pickled eggs. Ultimately I could never quite place what it was that I smelt throughout my home. It was too inconsistent. Both in its strange odor and the frequency in which it appeared. That putrid aroma would arrive so suddenly and then vanish without a trace. All attempts, in the beginning, did little to determine its source.\n\nAll around my apartment, upon every paper-coated wall, little changes began to form. Little gifts left behind bearing more and more signs of the growing change within my home. It was hardly noticeable in the beginning. The kind of thing your subconscious takes note of but fails to reach that aware and alert part of your brain, the part that takes note and makes sure you remember as your mind sifts through all the thoughts brought forward. I’m positive I noticed it early on, but I can’t remember when that was. I also no longer remember if it occurred before or after that smell began. Or even if they began in tandem with one another. What I do know now is that their existence was tied. I never could have suspected so at the time. There is very little reason to connect the dots between the smell I found suffocating me at odd hours of the day and the hardly noticeable peeling of my wallpaper.\n\nIt was so unremarkable when it first began. Nothing more than a few ripped edges along the top or bottom of an odd wall. It didn’t matter if it was the kitchen, the living room, the hall, or my bedroom. It was barely worth a glance in the beginning let alone a thought, but I am sure I noticed it back then. For the life of me, I can’t remember if that’s when I first smelt it. I wonder if the smell came first or if it only arrived after things left the realm of the unexceptional. What I do know for a fact is that when I walked through my home to discover long strands dangling down from the top of the wall and torn off from its base, I was already well aware of that horrid scent. As days passed they appeared more often, scattered throughout my apartment at intervals that caused me to simply stand and ponder as to why this might be occurring. In the beginning, I could never find a reason and even now I still have so many questions. In the morning every now and again I’d find a few long strands collected just beneath the wall in a neat little pile. Above would be the tear marks. The spot where they once clung to now free of the once dangling pieces of paper. As winter continued to press forward these events only continued to grow. Until one particularly cold morning, one where the wind howled and roared and the world outside had been blurred by snowfall, I would finally make an important discovery.\n\nWhen I awoke that morning there it was, staring right at me. It gave me no time to stumble upon it or to slowly build as my mind was occupied by the other happenings. The moment I opened my eyes it stood there across from me as if taunting me. I saw five neat strands of wallpaper hanging from my wall. They were small as if scratched into a peel, and each bent of themselves like they were asking to be pulled down. When I rose to my feet they met the bottom of my throat. In all my time I had not once touched them while they remained on the wall, and until that day they remained as frayed edges along the top or bottom of the wall. On that morning the second statement changed and soon the first would as well.\n\nWith my curiosity roused, I inspected the peculiarity before me. There was something in how different it was that truly aroused my curiosity. The tops of the strands didn’t appear chipped or clawed at, if anything it almost looked like they were pushed from the inside of the wall. Like something had ever so slightly pushed the tips of its fingers through the wallpaper until just enough of it had fallen down for me to grab onto. I did exactly that and pulled the first of the strands away. It ran for a few inches before thinning and then tearing off from the wall. Behind it lay nothing more than the same glimpse into the freshly exposed wall I’d already seen through the rest of my apartment. I don’t know what I had been hoping to find but I felt the smallest tinge of disappointment. My curiosity had not been satisfied and so I repeated the process grabbing hold of the next strand down the line. Once more I tugged down on it until it could no longer remain attached to the wall. It ripped gently, tickling my ears as it moved.\n\nAgain I’m not sure what it was I noticed first. I remember coughing when it hit me though. Cowering away and burying my nose and mouth into my sleeve. It was less like a small gut punch and more like an assault on my entire system. The unmistakable feeling of vomit, rising up and burning my throat, was hard to ignore as I recoiled. After a few groans, I was able to push back against the feeling. Up until that moment I had never encountered a smell that could make my eyes water or sting with such ferocity. With my fist pressed against my mouth and nostrils, I looked back up as I used all my willpower to avoid gagging and picked up where I had left off. There was no mistaking it, through my curiosity, I had seemingly found the source of the smell. Hidden behind the remaining pieces of wallpaper it laid dormant, my eyes only able to see the edge which peeked out from behind the paper. What I saw was nothing more than a small hole.\n\nunapologetically silent and eerily dark it sat there barely exposed. With a hand covering the lower half of my face, I continued to remove the remaining strands one by one. The smell remained as repulsive as ever as I rid the wall of the remaining strands of paper. It seemed to reach its putrid peak the moment it was revealed and proved to linger, never fading or dulling in the time to come. Once I had removed all the wallpaper, all that remained was the hole. Barely any bigger than a quarter. It was peculiar, to say the least. It appeared as if the wall naturally curved inwards with it. Bending inside of itself through the piercing. As if it had been placed there by design. Even with the smell still hanging in the air, I couldn't stop myself from running my thumb along it. It was smooth to the touch. Not a single misshapen or jagged edge upon it. Perfectly round. Perfectly cut. Perfectly smooth. Even the smoke-stained primer which I had revealed followed the fold into the wall.\n\nMy curiosity had been satisfied in some aspects. I had found something after all, although the question of what I had found still remained, more importantly, I wanted to find what was creating that smell. I pulled back from the wall, no longer able to bear the scent of the hole a moment longer, and left the room. I entered my bathroom and squirted some toothpaste onto my finger and applied it to the skin just below my nose. After that, I entered my living room and found a mask and a small flashlight. Once it was slapped onto my face I returned to my room.\n\nThe smell was still nauseating in a sense, but I was able to withstand it far more than I could previously and so I approached the hole. Placing one hand on the wall beside it I leaned in closing an eye as I did so. What I saw inside the hole was an absence of anything at all. Although I suppose that isn’t entirely correct. I did see something. Before my eyes was a never-ending all encompassing darkness where not even a hint of light shown. The smell overpowered my defenses and I pulled back coughing and gagging. Stepping away I noticed the shadows cast throughout my room reaching out across every wall and sparse bit of furniture. My once bright room had dimmed almost considerably. Like the very sun had moved in the brief moment.  Once the feeling of nausea had subsided I turned back to the hole flicking on the flashlight as I did so.\n\nA spotlight was cast before me illuminating the area around the hole in a perfect circle. The wall shined back at me in a grotesque shade of yellow but to my surprise, the hole seemed unaffected by the beam of light. It simply vanished upon contact. As if the darkness had been sucked in and absorbed leaving no trace behind. In truth, it was repulsively dark. I was bewildered at what I saw and for only a moment I wondered if I had been mistaken somehow, that maybe what I thought was a hole was merely just a splash of black paint. I knew however this couldn’t be true. I touched it. Felt its curves. Gazed into its infinite darkness with my own eye, and most importantly I had been tortured via its stench. Regardless, despite all my reasons to the contrary, I couldn’t stop myself from touching it once more. To prove what I saw was real. As I touched it again ever so slightly the tip of my thumb slipped inside it. I jolted back in an instant. It felt like I had just had my thumb frozen in a block of ice. It was freezing cold. I cupped it and winced from the temperature difference. No cold air had flowed out of the hole itself but the inside of it was impossibly cold.\n\nMore perplexed than ever I leaned towards the hole cupping the side of my face with my free hand. I brought the light in as close as I could and stared into the hole. Still, I saw nothing. I should have been able to spy studs and insulation, or wires and rusted pipes, I would have even found it less bizarre to gaze into the apartment next to mine. The light did nothing to breach the darkness. I stayed there for a minute trying my best to make out something, anything at all. As I gazed into the hole of vanishing light and everlasting darkness I could feel the world around me slowly slip away. All sounds remained unheard. All distractions were discarded. I stood frozen in time waiting for my eyes to adjust, so I could make out something in the dark. But nothing was ever seen.\n\nThe smell hit me like a title wave out of nowhere and I jumped back from the wall. This time the room around me was almost as dark as the hole itself. Behind the ever-raging snowstorm just past my window glowed soft street lights. In my right hand remained the flashlight. Its beam had long since been extinguished. My eyes darted around the room in shock. Seemingly hours had passed as I gazed into the hole. I felt a cold shiver run down my spine and my stomach turned for reasons other than the smell in the air. I stumbled over to my phone pressing the power button. The glow burst forward, stinging my eyes slightly. Its screen displayed missed texts sent hours prior and two missed phone calls. Above all the notifications I saw the time. 8:53. I stumbled out of the room in what I can only describe as a daze entering the dark hallway with sweating palms. I remember muttering to myself as I mindlessly placed one foot ahead of the other. I don't know what it was I said but I’m sure it was a series of incomprehensible garbage. The ramblings of a man whose world was just thrown upside down.\n\nMy hands first hit my face then ran up through my hair as I fell to my knees. The scent wafted out from my room but for the first time, it was hard to focus on. Looking back I’d probably say my mind was empty, but I’m sure it was a whirlpool of thought. I sat releasing staggered breath after staggered breath for a while. Once the shaking stopped I pushed myself back up. More hesitant than ever I inched towards the bedroom. When I reached its edge, with a lowered gaze, I grabbed a hold of the doorknob and pulled it. The moment before it closed I couldn’t stop my eyes from shifting upward. The hole remained as dark as ever. My next decision might not have been rational but all the same, my hand slipped behind the door and twisted the lock before I finally shut it.\n\nThe smell still crept out through the crack beneath the door but closing it had reduced it if only slightly. With a deep breath, I turned my back on the room and walked towards my living room making sure to flick on the hall light as I passed its switch. My head felt light, my stomach serged with the pains of hunger, and my throat begged desperately for a glass of water. I heated some leftovers, poured myself a cup, and took a seat before the tv. Whatever I turned on fell into silence as my mind focused on only one thing. I wanted to be rid of that hole. I didn’t care what it was. I didn’t care what made that smell. Impossibly I had lost hours gazing into the unknown. Time I would never get back. Answers were worthless to me at that point. What had happened, all of it, shouldn’t have been possible. I thought about the hole for hours as I sat there on my couch and as the tv droned on I eventually was overtaken by the hands of sleep.\n\nThat night I dreamed of a voice calling out to me. My apartment was consumed by the same darkness that lived within the hole. It was thick like smoke but as scentless as fog. Like a fine vapor, the dark substance shifted through the air as I followed the voice. Soon I found myself back in my bedroom. Gone was the furniture, or any semblance that I had once inhabited the room. All that remained was the hole in the wall. It looked slightly bigger. Still perfectly circular but larger than I had left it. The black clouds which hovered above the floor throughout my home leaked out from within the hole. The voice, so seductive, begged me to stare into it one more time. It promised me so many things. All I had to do was take one last look and what I desired would be mine. With each step, the voice grew louder but it wasn’t coming from the hole. In truth, it had no real location at all. The voice was everywhere and nowhere all at once. The thought of rejecting its offer never crossed my mind and before I knew it I was bending over, placing my hands against the wall, and looking into its depth again.\n\nI awoke with a scream. The entirety of the dream still fresh in my mind, horribly vivid in every aspect other than its final moments. I had no recollection of what I saw, but whatever it was horrified me. I gasped for air desperately as I shot up and that's when the smell hit me and my room came into focus. The door was wide open and I did not lay beneath the warm sheets of my bed. I slowly looked behind me and saw the hole above my head. I wasted no time. I lept to my feet and bolted out of the room. Grabbing my keys and wallet I left my apartment behind and drove down to the nearest hardware store. After thirty minutes I found myself standing back in my apartment with all the necessary tools to get rid of the hole in my two hands.\n\nI didn’t have a single explanation for anything. The hole only confused me more and more after each interaction. There was not a single doubt in my mind that whatever I had found seemed to be impossible but deep down I wished for some form of logical explanation. With all rational aspects of my brain running on fumes, any clear answer stayed far out of reach. I dreaded looking at it again. Horrified at the prospect of losing more time and in all honesty despite the fact I knew what I had experienced the night prior was nothing more than a nightmare, it had left a horrible taste in my mouth. So standing there, with hours lost the day prior to a hole devoid of any light, I couldn’t help but question my own sanity. The truth is however even if whatever I was experiencing was all in my head I still wanted to be rid of it. I felt as though if I simply removed the hole then even if I was crazy it could no longer torment me. Or rather I could no longer torment myself with it.\n\nTightening my grip around my freshly purchased supplies I made my way toward the bedroom. As the door gently creaked open immediately I felt unnerved. I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was being watched. It felt as though a thousand eyes were cast upon me. With a single but deep breath, I pushed away the strange feelings and approached the hole in my wall.\n\nAlthough at bay my unease grew with every step forward. Carefully I set my tools down and looked toward the hole. I thought back to my dream and wondered what I could have seen within. Even with my fear and against my better judgment I decided to take one last look into it. Hoping with every fiber of my being that I was somehow mistaken the day prior. That there was some sort of explanation for whatever I was dealing with. So I turned my phone's flashlight on and peered into the hole for what I hoped would be the final time.\n\nIt greeted me with what I unfortunately expected. A vast all consuming darkness which no light could penetrate and no objects could be seen. With my sanity in question and my fears confirmed I pushed myself away from the wall. The moment I did dread overtook me. The kind of dread that reaches down to your very core. I knew at that moment without a doubt everything about the situation was instinctually wrong as my now dead phone weighed heavy in my hand. This time I looked only for a moment yet again when I pulled away my room was cast in darkness. I think tears welled up in my eyes as I stood there, the realization setting in. Those tears didn’t last long however as soon rage took hold.\n\nI made for the light switch and then for my tools. First I cut the mesh and applied it to the hole, then after that was done I applied the primer. It might sound dumb to say but I stood there and watched as it dried. I’d like to say I did it out of spite, for losing so much time already to the thing, and maybe that’s partially true, but the real reason I dared not move was out of fear. Fear for if I turned my back on it somehow it would be there once again. Hours passed and I remained until it was dry enough to sand. Once that was complete I pushed against the spot where it once stood half expecting my thumb to re-enter its cold depths, but the patch stood strong. With a weekend lost but thankful to be able to forget about whatever I had stumbled across, I decided to take a relaxing bath.\n\nI sank into the hot water, feeling every ounce of stress leave my body. I stayed there for well over an hour feeling all my stress melt away bit by bit. Feeling fresh I exited the bath, and with a towel around my waist moved into the living room. I had work the next day and too much time had been lost already. I could feel the sting of hunger back with a vengeance and my throat felt drier than a desert. I cooked myself some hot dogs. Cut fresh mold off of buns that had only been a few days old and took a seat on the couch. I was so thirsty I drank four cups of water, it was the most I had ever had in one sitting. I felt terribly exhausted and lay back on my couch. With my front door in full view, it was only then I noticed the blinking red light on my home phone. I got back up and approached the small device. My hand hovered above the play button while worry took hold. Hesitantly I pushed the button and the message began to play.\n\n“Hey Derrick this is Peter, it’s nine fifteen currently and I was just calling to see if you planned on showing up to work today. I know things can come up, so just call me back and let me know.”\n\nIt was my boss. There was a click and the next message began. He said the date and still as friendly as ever and asked where I was. Another message played and he repeated the date again, but it was different this time. It was two days later. Finally, the last message played.\n\n“I’m sorry to say but this is unacceptable. It’s been all week and I haven't heard a thing from you. I’ve tried calling your cell and nothing. I even stopped by your place but nobody was home. I got a business to run here and clearly, you’ve got other things going on, I’m gonna have to let you go Derrick.” The message ended abruptly after that.\n\nI felt the world around me start to spin. My knees buckled as my legs lost all strength. I felt sick. All of this was impossible. None of it made any sense. Almost hyperventilating I simply muttered the word how over and over again. My hands shook as my eyes drifted down the hall. In a steady flow, it gently glided inches above the floor. To my horror, it was the black vapor from my dream. Charging down the hall in a daze I burst through the door only to find my patch job menacingly absent. My supplies still sat on the floor beneath the hole, but the effects of my handiwork were nowhere to be seen. The black vapor oozed out from the depths of the small circular cut and clouded over my floor. It was back. In a fit of anger, I returned to my living room. Rustling through drawers, I tossed items to the side one by one until my hands wrapped around a small hammer. I was back in the room in an instant and wasting no time I brought the teeth of the hammer crashing down into the wall. It caught nicely and I pulled back with all my might as chunks of drywall burst out around me. I repeated this act again and again and again and again and again and again until more hole remained than wall. I could finally see studs and insulation everything I hoped for. Then I blinked.\n\nIn that brief instant of time, all the damage I had done was restored. That perfect circle that was the hole presented itself before me perfectly untouched. I snapped then. I decided I’d tear the whole wall down if that’s what it took. I crouched down just below the hole and swung the blunt end of the hammer into it. The drywall exploded on impact and fell beneath the cloud at my feet. I continued as bits of wall shot out towards me until finally there was a hole big enough for me to fit my body into. Sticking my head through the freshly exposed area I looked up and instead of darkness once more I saw all I wished to see. The normal innards of a wall. Oddly enough from down there, no hole could be seen. I pulled back then, bits of loose drywall breaking off on my shoulders. When I stood the smile that had made its way across my face was wiped away in a moment. The unaffected hole remained before me.\n\nI crouched back down and broke through the wall into the vacant apartment next to me. Crawling through, bits of draw wall, dust, and cobwebs clung to my body. The only thing on my mind at that point was the hole. I didn’t care about anything else. I simply wanted to be rid of whatever this thing was. Turning around I beat at the wall until hardly anything remained. After I was done, dripping with sweat, I should have guessed what I would see. From the other side of the wall, there was no hole at all. No darkness. Nothing more than what you’d expect to see when staring at the guts between two apartments. Bewildered, I returned to my own apartment back through the tunnel I had made and there it sat. Its eerie darkness showed nothing of what I had just done behind it.\n\nIt was then I screamed. Loud and without an ounce of care, until my voice was horse and dead. I stumbled backward feeling defeated and slumped against the wall opposite the hole. I stayed there, staring at it for what felt like an eternity. Its gaseous ooze, likely now filling my entire apartment. Deep within hidden beneath my fear and rage, beneath all the confusion and bewilderment, something pulled on a string. The feeling rose as I sat there staring at the hole. Something compelled me to look into it. I fought the urge as best I could, praying to never look into that darkness ever again. I lasted for as long as I could but broke soon after I heard the voice. It was the same one from my dream. I recognized it instantly. I stood before realizing I was walking towards it. Just like my dream, I looked into it.\n\nThe darkness greeted me once again but the moment my face came to rest against the cool wall I knew something was off. Within its murky confines for the first time, I could almost make something out. Barely more than an outline the gentle edges of something within the shadowed fog could be seen. I could feel my hair stand and my mind screamed at me to run but I stayed. I watched. Paralyzed I saw as at first, it twitched. I got the impression of something bulbous pushing and moving beneath tight skin. Then I saw it. Slowly it opened as the top and bottom parted revealing an eye staring back at me. Its sclera was so impossibly white it almost glowed. Through the darkness I could now see ink-like eyelids and lashes, and in the sea of white sat a black iris. It stared at me unblinking. I screamed and stumbled back from the wall. The moment I did six inky tendrils shot out from within the hole. They moved for my chest in a flash and dug into me. It burned as they writhed beneath my skin. I could feel every twitch as they dug deeper and deeper inside me. I looked up briefly to see the eye pressed against the edges of the hole. It squeezed together as it pushed through making a disgusting wet noise. It dug deeper inside me as the eye grew ever closer. When the wet eye made contact with my skin it didn’t cut through like the tendrils it simply kept moving. It forced itself inside me, burning every inch of the way.\n\nI’m so cold now. I’m freezing, to be honest. It's there. Inside of me. There on my chest. It’s watching me type this. I can feel it wiggling its appendages throughout my body. My fingers have started moving on their own and I hear it speak to me. It says I’ve been chosen. It picked me for something. I don’t know what yet but we are one. Becoming one. This is only the beginning. My eyes are open now. I see so many things. So many ideas. Things I was never supposed to know but it's shown me. We are one.\n\nI made the choice to stare into the darkness and now I will never go back. I’m glad. After all, I finally got my story.",

        "text": "( First: https://redd.it/o8vgiw Previous: https://redd.it/101q49o )\n\nI hadn’t been getting a lot of sleep lately. Which wasn’t a new fact. My thoughts kept going between trying to make my apartment ready for Sunny, and thinking about a certain offer. A massive creature I was scared to death of offered to sleep with me. I absolutely did not want to take her up on that. Aside from not being sure of what her appearance may be, I wasn’t keen on handing myself over to a creature. I doubted I would come out of that encounter the same person I went into it. And yet, for some reason that monster had a hold on my mind.  \n\nI found myself yawning at work wanting some sort of job to distract me. I arrive first, which sometimes happens. I spoke with the receptionist who just listened to my small talk. I hadn’t met this one before. She was very shy, or at least seemed like it. I ran out of things to say so we just waited in the empty room a bit awkwardly until Max showed up. \n\nMy mood got better seeing him but also because of who he brought along. Sunny walked in holding Max’s hand. They got along pretty well and Sunny really brightened up. I have no idea what kind of life he led before we met. Or what life she led. To be honest, I wasn’t entirely certain of Sunny’s gender. That day my new roommate came in wearing a super cute sundress with the jacket I lent. A few days ago, I learned a little bit about Sunny’s species. They were able to change their genders if needed. But Sunny looked the same as when we met. A flat chest but with long hair. Gender is a tricky thing. \n\n“Toby! We got permission for Sunny to go with us today!” Max said cheerfully. \n\nHe loved making new friends and I was glad we were doing a safe enough job to bring someone as delicate as Sunny.  \n\n“It sounds like fun. Oh, would you like your jacket back?” Came a soft voice that made me do a double take. \n\nSunny spoke. It only took Rufus a little over a week to teach an entire language to someone. I felt pretty impressed.  \n\n“You can hold onto it. I know Max says this job is going to be fun but you never. Know. But uh, can I ask something that might come off as rude?” I said to them. \n\nThe pair looked at each other. Sunny was made up of a clear somewhat solid substance. I could almost see the thoughts going around in that transparent head. \n\n“Are you a guy or a girl? Sorry it’s just... I don’t really know much about creatures like you. I’ll call you whatever you like.” I said wondering if that was too insulting. \n\nSunny let out a small laugh not upset at the question. This might be something that came up pretty often when it came to their species. They could switch what gender they are, and pretty much look the same either way so it was hard to tell. \n\n“I think you saw me as a guy to start with so I’ll stick with that. I don’t really care what you call me though. I never really understood the concept of it all. I’m just glad I’m in a position to wear whatever I like and don’t need to change my body depending on my partner’s preference.” \n\nI couldn’t help but frown at the mention of what could have been. Sunny’s species had been artificially made.  There was a theory that the person who first made that kind of slime creature wanted to produce a disposable army. But it ever turned out like that. Since they are so weak, they tended to be used for pretty terrible reasons. Sunny was a rare case where he actually acted like a person and not an empty doll that just did whatever their owner told them to. If he wasn’t bought by the ones who found him first, I really hated to think about what could have happened. \n\n“You three better get a move on. And please make sure my bother doesn’t linger. He's been wasting too much time on jobs lately.” The receptionist spoke for the first time.  \n\nI was shocked at how clear her voice sounded compared to her sisters. Maybe she didn’t smoke. She was right. Max tended to drag me around after a job instead of checking back in for more work. \n\nMax gathered up the packages we needed to deliver and nodded his head towards the door. We needed to get a move on. I helped with some finding the boxes fairly heavy. Sunny helped out picking up the remaining boxes. He might be weak by creature standards, but much stronger than a human. We said goodbye to his sister hoping this job would be as easy as he claimed to be. \n\nA scented breeze welcomed us. My vision blocked by the boxes at first. I followed Max’s excited voice along a well-worn path along a green hillside. We walked through a wooden gate and up to a cute cabin. This place looked to be out of some sort of fairy tale. Max set the boxes down by the front steps, calling out for the owner that we arrived. We followed his actions piling our boxes next to his.  \n\nI finally got a good look around. The view taking my breath away. We were on a farm set on the side of a tall hill surrounded by a deep forest. The hill started to roll downwards at the back of the cabin exposing a view of green mountain sides. The one who lived here heard Max. He made his way over to us with a friendly smile.  \n\nHe stood about as tall as Rufus. His face covered with a beard and a set of curled horns came out of the side of his head. He walked on hoove feet making me think he was some sort of goat hybrid creature. Max ran over to give him a hug overjoyed to see the man again.  \n\n“This is Joe! We deliver all his farming supplies for him. Can I go see the sheep?” Max said, voice loud and bright. \n\n“They’re already on their way to see you. Go on.” The man said and directed Max to a gathering crowd. \n\nI walked over to the man to introduce ourselves as Max ran off. I didn’t have the paper Joe needed to sign to say we delivered the boxes but I told him I could help carry them to where ever they needed to go. He waved off the offer saying he could move them around later and then invited us for lunch. I started to get a bit stressed. I wanted to stay but thought about the warning about letting Max play around too much. \n\nI looked up just in time to see my partner in a full sprint towards a very round sheep. For some reason it looked like the sheep was wearing a black wig. To my horror, he pulled back his leg to kick the sheep as hard as he could. The thing never stood a chance. It flew in a perfect arc in the air and I couldn’t help but let out a gasp over what I just saw. Max wasn’t the sheep kicking sort of person. Why on Earth would he hurt a poor animal like that? Joe saw my expression causing him to laugh. \n\n“It’s alright. They like getting kicked.” Sunny quickly explained in a soft voice. \n\nI saw the first sheep hit the ground and bounce a few times. It rolled over perfectly fine, then started to run back for another ride through the air. Max set his sights on the others that swarmed him. It didn’t really put me at ease knowing they weren’t hurt by such a thing. \n\n“Their wool makes up part of the jackets. It’s one of the reasons why they’re so strong.” Sunny explained further. \n\nI felt something touch my hand. Looking down, I saw a sheep that walked up to me to place a head in my palm. I started petting it, finding the weird hairstyle to not be a wig at all. It looked like a long bowl cut. Straight and even at the ends. It really looked stupid. When the sheep looked up, I couldn’t help but pull my hand away seeing the face. \n\nThe eyes were hidden but instead of a sheep's face, a human smiled back at me. They all looked like that. A sheep body with the weird hair and a person face. \n\nI hated it. I cannot find the words to stay how much I hated it. Animals with people faces are now on the top of my list of unsettling things I’ve seen on this job.  \n\n“Uh... Do they have a special name?” I asked trying to keep my voice even. \n\n“Human Faced Sheep.” Sunny said with a smile. \n\nThat was a pretty straightforward name. I wish someone warned me before we showed up here. I might have stayed behind.  \n\n“How about you kids have some lunch?” Joe offered taking my mind off the sheep trauma. \n\nI should not have accepted the offer, but I kind of wanted Sunny to have a nice time. A table was set up at the back of the cabin so we could look out at the mountain side watching the clouds go by. Sometimes a breeze blew some smells of flowers with some golden pedals from the other hills. We called Max over who gladly helped set food on the table. Joe put out a bunch of fresh buns and ingredients so we could call make our own sandwiches. \n\nFor a stranger he made us feel at home. He also set out some fresh fruit and berries as a small snack afterwards. I’ve never tried figs before. Sunny suggested I have one with a certain kind of fancy cheese with honey. I’ve never tasted anything better in my life. I watched Sunny eat for a few minutes trying to figure it out. Since he was transparent, I could see the food in his mouth for a few seconds. He made chewing motions but the food just melted away. Apparently, his species produced acid that digested anything inside their body within seconds. He also could get energy from just sitting in the sun. But since Sunny could taste things, he preferred eating. \n\nIn such a short amount of time, Sunny learned a great deal. I think he was far smarter than myself. Him and Joe talked about topics I didn’t have a clue about mostly relating to farming. After our lunch I started to help clean the table. A sheep got in my path causing me to stop and stare at it. I didn’t like these things in the slightest \n\n“Fossilized remains.” \n\nThe sheep spoke. I took a step back now freaked out from the child like voice coming from the creature. I bumped into Sunny nearly knocking some dishes from his hands. He laughed at my expression and how much I disliked the sheep near me. \n\n“They can talk but only say nonsense words. Don’t worry about it.” He assured me. \n\nI gave the sheep a side eye while finishing up my chore. We really needed to get going. I wanted to find Joe and Max to get the paper signed to leave. Max stood in the field clapping along with the song I taught Rufus on my first day. While he sang, all the sheep started to walk in his direction. Every one of them swayed their heads side to side in a line in unison. After they arrived in front of Max, they just stayed still besides their heads moving.  \n\nI hated the sight. It made my skin crawl. I shook my head trying to accept that at least Max was having fun. I wanted to get away from the herd of creepy sheep so I set my eyes on finding where Sunny went off too. I found him near the table folding the cloth we used to cover it with some issues with the breeze. The sunlight caught his clear hair in the right way causing the light to distort behind him. The orange spot in the middle of his head shining brightly. The sight made me stop walking; my chest heavy for some reason. \n\nI just spent a nice lunch in a beautiful place I never could dream of with two great friends. Max cheerfully sang and hand fun on our little trip and Sunny spent a good time being around people who would never dare hurt him. A year ago, I never would have even hoped this could have happened. I had friends who cared about me and I found myself suddenly realizing just how much I loved the ones around me. Monsters or not, they were important to me. Sunny noticed me hovering around, his face turning to worry. \n\n“Are you alright?” He asked concerned. \n\nI didn’t notice until then but my eyes started to tear up. I quickly rubbed them dry saying the wind just blew something into them. I would have made my new friend uncomfortable if I told him the real reason why I suddenly got overwhelmed. Joe finally came out and Max came back ready to let him sign the delivery form. \n\n“Joe, where did Hubert go off to? I didn’t see her today.” Max asked, paper in hand. \n\nJoe paused not signing the paper just yet. He looked over his sheep silently counting them face slowly falling.  \n\n“Her?” I asked wondering about the name. \n\n“Most of the sheep are born as males. I named them before I knew I had a female. But Max is right. Hubert isn’t here. That isn’t a good sign. Can I bother you kids to say a little longer? I would like to check to see if there are any holes in the fence.” Joe said. \n\nWe call nodded. He did just feed us after all. We would die for him if he asked. We worked in teams of two to walk along the fence. Joe with me, and Max with Sunny. The fence didn’t look like it could keep the sheep in very well. Joe explained it was magic. As long as the boards were in place, nothing could cross it. But he did need to recharge the spell keeping it together pretty often. We were almost done our side when I heard Max shouting at us. We hurried over to see what they found. \n\nA wooden board sat in the ground apparently torn off from the rest of the fence. Some marks in the soft wood made it clear Hubert was the one who used her teeth to rip the board off. I stared at the forest beyond the small farm seeing a trail of broken twigs left behind the odd-looking sheep.  \n\n“I’ll have to call someone in to deal with this.” Joe said mostly to himself. \n\nThe trees were densely packed together with wisps of mist between the low branches. I caught Max’s eyes and frowned with him. He was worried about how long it might take to get some helpers to find the lone sheep in the woods. I knew where this was heading so I spoke up. \n\n“We can look for her.” I offered. \n\nJoe started to shake his head before I even finished speaking. Max quickly walked over to me, his face bright and confident in our abilities.  \n\n“We’ll be fine! Toby went through The Maze without a handbook on his first day and made it alive! He’s done a lot of impressive things like dealing with a ghost. We can take a look and if we don’t find anything we’ll just come back the way we came.” Max explained. \n\nI’d totally forgotten about the whole handbook thing. Now that I had Sunny, I doubted I really needed one. He seemed to know pretty much everything. But Max was right. We’d gotten out of tighter spots before. So far, I’ve only lost an arm but Joe didn’t need to know that. \n\n“Look for ten minutes then you boys come back, alright?” Joe relented. \n\nMax agreed and took my hand. We left Sunny behind knowing this would be too dangerous for him. He watched us leave a bit scared no matter how much he wanted to hide it. I promised that we would come back no matter what. With that, I followed my partner deeper into the woods following a pretty obvious trail. \n\nAs we walked, I asked Max why Joe didn’t come with us. I mostly wanted to keep my fear at bay by talking. The woods were creepy as hell. The air still as a grave. Nothing moved and I found it hard to breathe. Max said that Joe wasn’t a full creature but a half breed. That meant Max was stronger than the man even though it didn’t look like it. And he knew who to call so him staying behind was a good idea. \n\nI thought I heard a twig snap and my hand went to hold onto Max. He didn’t look to mind at all. My eyes were drawn away for him for a few seconds. I felt him slip out of my grasp, my gaze still fixed on where I swore I heard the sound of something else in the trees.  \n\n“Hey Max is there...” I started to ask, my voice trailing off. \n\nI only had my eyes off of him for less than a few seconds. When I looked back, he was gone. Not a single trace left behind of where he might have walked off to. I shouldn’t have gotten as frantic as I did. I started calling out his name hoping he heard. I took a few steps forwards wondering if I should stay in one spot or not. I pulled out my phone seeing a black screen that refused to turn on. I cursed at how useless the thing was most of the time. My foot came down, meeting nothing but air. My body pitched forwards down a long rough slope that hadn’t been there a second ago. \n\nI raised my arms over my face saving it from scratches or smacks against rocks on the way down. I finally came to a rolling stop pretty hard against a tree. I let myself sit trying to recover from the pain. I felt the hits even through my work uniform. I’ve heard rumors that the uniforms weren’t as powerful in certain places but doubted I ever would be in those places.  \n\nWith my body screaming in pain, I sat up trying to figure out where I ended up. The fog made it hard to see past a certain point. I tested my legs to make sure I didn’t twist my ankle. When I knew nothing broke on the way down, I got up to start looking for a path back up the slope. The hill far too steep for me to climb back up. I started shout Max’s name again hoping his big ears picked up my voice.  \n\nI moved along the path enclosed on both sides by a wall of dirt. This much have been a thin but deep stream at some point. Through the fog I noticed a shape on the ground a few feet in font. My foot landed in a puddle casing me to jolt away from the cold seeping through to my socks. I jumped again seeing the color of what I stepped in. A puddle of blood sat in my path leading to a trail towards a shape on the ground. My heart sank down to the ground. Unable to help myself I ran forwards, my fear carrying my body. \n\nI saw the thing I dreaded the most. Max was face down on the dirt, the back of his jacket torn open. I wasted no time getting down next to him to roll him over trying to see the damage. I didn’t even hear another creature in these woods, what the hell happened to him? Any thoughts in my mind disappeared at the sight of his face.  \n\nA scream started in my throat. One so large I couldn’t let it out all at once. My best friend stared up at the sky with blank blind eyes. His throat torn out, the wound appearing pale from him bleeding out. I hitched up my lunch, my body rejecting the sight. This wasn’t possible. No matter how much I refused to believe what I was seeing, my mind still reeled from the sight.  \n\nA sound behind me made me scream again. I quickly turned expecting to see the monster that did this to Max. Instead, my eyes landed on something that shouldn’t be possible. Rufus stumbled out of the fog, his body also torn and bloody. He attempted to speak, his voice nothing but a rasp of air. \n\n“Your... fault...” \n\nHe collapsed and I swooped in trying to keep him on his feet. His body too heavy to support. He shook him, crying begging for him to stay awake. In the back of my mind, I wanted to believe I was just seeing things. After all, why was Rufus even there? And if Max got hurt on a job because of me, he would never put the blame on the weak human for what happened.  \n\nI kept shaking my head while trying to make his limp body to move. The next few minutes made me nearly spiral into a madness there would be no going back from. I didn’t just see Rufus and Max dead in the small pathway. I saw everyone I cared about. All of my co-workers from the mailing company bloody and torn apart, blaming me for their deaths. The sight that almost broke me was seeing a person I’d nearly forgotten. \n\nMy mother stood on the pathway. Her face clouded by the mist. She wore the dress I last saw her in. A red flowing one she hated but my father loved. I never really knew what happened to her. She just left us when I was younger. Despite that, I still loved her. A scream came from her, one that ripped through the fog and into my long-buried memories. I knew I’d heard her scream like that before? But what caused her to make such a sound? I nearly brought up the answer when something smacked me very, very hard in the face. \n\nI toppled over, a soft whiteness suffocating me. I frantically pulled the thing off to gasp in air. I held the thing in my arms to recover. Looking around I found myself in the middle of the forest path where I first lost Max. There was no fog, no slope and no dead bodies of my loved ones around me. And I had a small sheep in my arms. \n\n“Hubert...?” I asked slowly. \n\nThe sheep looked up at me, the eyes hidden behind the dark hair. It nodded confirming my suspicions. \n\n“I just... I saw....” I sputtered trying to make sense of it. \n\n“Fears. You saw fears.” The sheep answered back. \n\nI didn’t think these creatures could hold a conversation. Then again, Hubert may be special. I slowly got back to my feet feeling relived that what I saw wasn’t real. But that didn’t make me feel a hundred percent better. I would still have the memories if what I saw in my head. And this forest could show me those images again at any time. \n\n“I need to find Max and get out of here. Do you know where he is?” I asked desperate to leave. \n\nHubert made a nod forwards. She jumped from my arms to led the way. At least she didn’t go too far ahead of me. She knew these woods better than I did so I trusted the little sheep to lead the way. Then again, was she real? Or was this another trick the forest was showing me? I would just need to deal with her not being real if that happened. \n\nAs we walked, I kept feeling as if I’ve forgotten something. Like I was on the verge of remembering a very important fact. A dark secret that I wouldn’t be able to handle. Hubert noticed my distress. She paused walking to look up at me. Her hair parted enough for me to see one of her eyes. Countless stars glittered in her eye, staring up at me and through my entire self.  \n\n“Do not look for things that are lost.” She warned in a cryptic tone. \n\nA chill ran through my body. She quickly turned away leaving not time to question what she meant. I went back to following her trying to figure out the meaning of the warning. Hubert led us to an opening in the path. It was another sudden drop off but at least I didn't fall down this one. My breath once again got taken away by the view. Some fog covered parts of the mountains. I've never seen such a vast rolling forest before. The sunlight breaking through the mist to reflect off of the countless different shades of green leaves moving in the breeze. This place must be in a different world than my own because there wasn’t a place on Earth as beautiful. \n\nI can never have something nice. The moment of awe became ruined when I saw a shape moving in the mist. It flicked in such an unnatural way it drew my attention towards it. I really wish I hadn’t. With a loud booming sound, the thing fully forced itself into the world. The round shape came down from the sky, blowing away all the fog and nearly knocked me off my feet. When I recovered from the powerful wind, I started in fear at what I saw. \n\nA floating orb made up of wings and eyes slowly moved through the air between the hills. This thing was massive. A feeling of strangling air coming off of it. My body became paralyzed when I realized those eyes slowly started to move in my direction. I was so small compared to this thing. I never would have thought it would even noticed someone like me. It was as if I started to sink into a sea of fear as that massive thing started to drift in my direction. I didn’t know what would happen if it reached me. I could only assume my fate would be something no human could ever understand. \n\nHubert saved my ass once again. While I became transfixed by the monster in the sky, she found a branch to pull back on. When she let go, the branch snapped her small body forwards making me turn just in time to catch her. I lost my footing making me fall a second time that day. I wrapped around her thinking I was going to die. We fell for so damn long it made me sick. I nearly passed out from the rushing air. Instead of dying when I landed, we were gently caught as if we only fell a few feet. \n\n“Oh, you found her!”  \n\nI snapped open my eyes to see Max alive and well. He easily held us in his arms. I wasted no time letting Hubert down to the ground to give Max a very long hug. I really thought he died in these woods. He had no idea why I got so upset but was glad for the hug either way.  \n\n“Let’s get the hell out of here.” I said trying to hide the fact I nearly burst into tears. \n\nHubert started down the trail and to my great relief, we were out of the woods in the matter of minutes. Joe and Sunny rushed over to us happy to see that we all made it out safely. Sunny gave me a hug which I found pretty nice after everything we went through. His body didn’t feel very solid. Like a very pleasant stress ball. I pulled away feeling awkward from the attention. He didn’t appear to be offended. \n\n“Did you boys see anything bad in there? The forest likes to mess with your head if you let it. You are wearing your uniforms, but that won’t save you if your head thinks you got beat up.” Joe explained to us. \n\nThat made sense why I hurt so much after my tumble down the hill. I actually didn’t get hurt but my brain didn’t know that. I considered telling them what I saw but found my words getting stuck. Max shook his head at first. Soon it became clear he did see something horrible in those woods. Considering how he’d lost a great deal of family members; I couldn’t imagine what he went through. \n\n“I saw that all the coffee places closed and I couldn’t get any more puppuccino’s.” He said with a thick voice. \n\nSunny patted his back trying to cheer him up. I don’t know why I expected anything else from him. At least it wasn’t overly traumatizing. \n\n“Hubert pretty much explained that to me after I found her so I’m not that upset over what I saw.” I somewhat lied. \n\nI would not be sleeping that night; I already knew that for certain. Joe did a double take between myself and his trouble maker of a sheep. The look on his face made me worried. \n\n“She spoke to you? That’s pretty rare. She can in a way tell fortunes. If she said anything else, it’s best to keep it to yourself.” He said and got us started walking back to the cabin. \n\n“It’s pretty lucky for her to talk to you! I’m a little jealous.” Max said already over what happened to him inside the misty woods. \n\n“There was something else. A big monster thing in the sky. What was that about?” I asked feeling cold just thinking about that creature. \n\nAll of them stopped in their tracks. If Sunny could get paler, he would have. The air grew still as if someone died instead of me asking a question. Then they all moved fast but stiff, none looking back at the woods. I found Joe with his hand on my back pushing me forwards and Max dragging my arm along. \n\n“I think we over stayed. We should really get going. It was a fun trip and all.” Max said quickly very stressed out. \n\nWe arrived to the front gate, Joe signing the delivery paper he should have when we first arrived. He also produced three wrapped sandwiches for us to take back. With some very awkward and quick goodbyes, we all arrived back into the Zero room. I was very confused on their actions and decided it was in my best interest to not question it.  \n\n“You guys are late. Did you enjoy your lunch?” The receptionist asked after we all walked inside the room. \n\nOn cue, we all hid our sandwiches behind our backs ashamed of playing around on company time. \n\n“We didn’t have lunch. We just uh... Took something to go. Here you can have mine.” Max offered up his sandwich trying not to get written up. \n\n“You have mustard on your jacket.” She pointed out. \n\nWe all looked at the yellow spot on his uniform jacket. Max made an attempt to destroy the evidence. At least the sandwich turned out to be enough of a bribe to not get us in trouble. Soon, Rufus came to pick up Sunny so Max and I could carry on with work for the rest of the day. I wasn’t able to focus on my job due to the horrors I saw that day and because today Sunny should be moved into my place later that night. \n\nHe only stayed with Rufus enough to learn how to speak and a few other things. He wasn't able to live with him long term. I hadn’t had a roommate in such a long time. The whole idea of it made me nervous. \n\nI got home late that day. I gave Rufus a key so Sunny was already unpacked by the time I walked in the door. I really should have moved after the whole ghost thing but couldn’t afford it. To my surprise Sunny cooked. Just a simple pasta dish but I wasn’t expected that. He didn’t own much. Just some clothes and books. Since he saw how tired I looked he agreed to do the dishes. I swore to him I wouldn’t leave all the chores to my new roomie. Only that night I wanted to be lazy and go to bed. \n\nBut no matter how tired I felt, I just couldn’t fall asleep that night. I curled up, letting the scenes from the day play through my mind. Which was a very bad idea. I simply couldn’t stop thinking about not only that day, but everything else that happened recently. I didn’t know I’d been crying until a soft knock came at my door. I quickly rubbed my eyes ashamed of how weak I looked.  \n\nI muttered to Sunny I was sorry if I woke him up. He peeked through the door giving his head a small shake. He held a pillow and to my surprise he came over to sit on the side of the bed. He flopped on his side, holding the pillow in front of him. He wore a very long nightgown that smelled like a thrift store. I doubted you could buy new outfits like that anymore. \n\n“If you want...” He said in a very small voice, his eyes downwards and not able to meet my own. \n\nMy stomach twisted thinking of what those words could mean. I rolled over shaking my head wanting nothing more for Sunny to forget what his species was bought and sold for. He wasn’t some object. I didn’t offer him to stay with me for those kinds of reasons. But I didn’t want to cut off any kind of physical contact either. I reached over to take his hand and nothing else. He stiffened expecting a different kind of request. \n\n“This is fine. I told you no one was ever going to touch you if you didn’t want them to. Offering yourself up because you think that’s all your worth counts.” I cursed myself for sounding so terrible because I just been crying.  \n\nEven if I said those words in a hoarse voice, Sunny still accepted them. He nodded relived that I told the truth back then. He expected that I made false promises in front of others to look good. I hated the idea he worried about living with a second person fearing he was just going to be used. I promised him again that wasn’t going to happen. \n\nI ended up falling asleep being so exhausted from the day. Holding Sunny’s hand help keep the nightmares away. Although, I woke up to a very frightening sigh in the morning. His body melted a little into a puddle of goop that sort of resembled human features. I freaked out thinking he somehow died during the night or the sun melted him. He snapped back into shape trying to calm me down. It seems like when his species fall asleep, they can’t really keep their shape. I wished someone told me that beforehand.  \n\nHaving a supernatural creature as a roommate was going to be an adjustment, but we were doing pretty good so far.",

        "text": "I walked down to a convenience store to pick up a few snacks for my travels. I was the only one inside said convenience store since it was early morning. The Cashier of the store fixed his eyes on me. I noticed him doing this, but I didn't care, letting him admire my appearance as I got the snacks I wanted.\n\nAs I was paying for my snacks with the few dollar bills I had, the Cashier started to initiate a conversation with me. And this conversation would spark my knowledge of a figure I may be similar to...\n\n\"So, you're the Black-Eyed Child, huh?\" The Cashier asked me.\n\n\"Yep, that's me. That a problem?\" I asked rudely.\n\n\"No, no. Nothing's wrong with that. It's just... I had an encounter with someone like you.\" The Cashier spoke with words that caught my attention.\n\n\"Like me? Is he a kid like me?\" I asked, surprised to hear what the Cashier had to say.\n\n\"No, he's not a kid. He's a full-grown adult. Perhaps, too grown...\" I could see the goosebumps forming on the Cashier's skin as he said this.\n\n\"He had similar features you do. The jet black hair, the snow-white skin, black veins, those kinds of features. Except he was massive. He wasn't just tall; he was all muscle with no fat. He's 7'2\" if you're wondering how tall he is... Everyone calls him the Man In Black...\" The Cashier sighed as he scanned the last of my items.\n\n\"How did your encounter play out?\" I asked, tilting my head like a horror movie slasher.\n\n\"It was horrible... My wife and I haven't heard from our son for quite some time. We started to worry that he wasn't walking from school for an hour. We decided to track his phone to see where he ended up. We got to one of the corners of the neighborhood...\" The Cashier described his first encounter with the Man.\n\n\"When we see the Man In Black, we were terrified to see him with our son, battered and bloodied. We were too stunned to speak as he turned to see us with malice behind his smile. He told my wife and I our son was bullying another kid for one month, and he sped away before we could say anything.\" The Cashier croaked as tears formed in his eyes.\n\nAs the Cashier told me his story, I started becoming scaredCashiert would happen next.\n\n\"When we ran to our son, my wife gasped in horror, and I was horrified to see him in his state. His limbs were twisted and broken. His shoulders were dangled, his collar bones were snapped, and his ribcage was shattered. All his organs were severely damaged. The doctor told us all this after we called 911 and took him to the ER.\" The Cashier whimpered and sniffed as he tried to hold back his tears.\n\nI was terrified and disgusted by how graphic the Cashier's story had gotten.\n\n\"Do you wanna know what the worst part about it all?\" The Cashier asked me.\n\n\"When our son recovered from his injuries one year later, he told us that when the Man-In-Black beat him to a pulp, he was conscious throughout the whole process... And when the doctor told us the Man In Black paid the hospital bill, he only did so to warn us that he wouldn't spare our son out of pity again...\" The cashier whimpered as he remembered the whole ordeal.\n\n\"Jesus... Do you think I would do things as he did?\" I was terrified beyond belief, feeling fear consume my body for the first time.\n\n\"No... I'm not saying you would do that...\" The cashier started sobbing as he covered his face.\n\nA middle-aged man, who I assume is the convenience store manager, put his hand on the Cashier's shoulder to tell him it was going to be okay. He took at me and said this.\n\n\"There's a reason how the actions of one person can shape another. I don't care who you are, kid. But no one deserves something like that happening to their child. Someone should teach that Man some humility...\" This was the only thing the manager said to me.\n\nI nodded in agreement as I paid for my snacks and walked out of the convenience store.\n\n**If I have the Man In Black encounter me at one point... I'll let you guys know...**",

        "text": "This is your first day of school, you are new. Follow these rules and stick to them if you expect to stay safe.\n\n0. ALWAYS, ALWAYS get the school helpline number the reasons for this are provided below.\n\n1. The car journey is relatively safe, however a few procedures and precautions should be taken.\n\n1a. During the journey if you see an old balding man outside the building ignore him and continue with your journey it is VERY important that you ignore him.\n\n1b. When you are entering the school DO NOT look at the roof, THEY are NOT friendly.\n\n2. If the school building is made of grey concrete then get out immediately and run back to your car, THAT is not your school. Instead stay home and return tomorrow, repeat this until you find a building in any other colour and material. After this the building is safe you can safely attend, the building will stop changing colours and will resume as normal.\n\n2a. If you enter it it is too late, your only hope is to escape using the windows. Otherwise refer to 'Rule 8'.\n\n3. If you enter a class and there is no teacher present, run and DO NOT look in the supply closet.\n\n4. While walking in the hallways you will be around other people, if you come across a section that is empty simply leave.\n\n4a. If you see eyes in the dark in the empty parts of the hallways do not worry they will not harm you unless provoked or harmed. They will become agitated or provoked if they see any kind of food, refrain from showing any type of food unless you want to be taken away.\n\n4b. If the empty hallway doesn’t end then use your phone to contact the school for help, this is one of the reasons for ‘Rule 0’. The school authorities will find you and take you back to the usual hallway.\n\n4c. If the authorities that come to help you has red eyes, or if you haven’t called anyone yet DO NOT in any circumstance go with them. Refuse kindly and change the topic, they will soon go away. After this thank whatever god you believe in because you just survived an encounter with THEM. If this is not successful refer to 'Rule 8'.\n\n5. The teachers are there to protect you, do not be afraid of them and trust them as long as they don’t have red eyes. If they do, then call school authorities.\n\n6. If you are in the hallways and you see familiar faces you may talk to them. But if they have red eyes RUN to the closest classroom and call authorities, you will be notified when it is safe. If you don't receive any notifications escape using the window and get as far as possible.\n\n7. If, while going to lunch or leaving school the sky turns red, RUN BACK INSIDE, after this find a place to hide, a classroom, supply closet or bathroom preferably not alone. THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT AND MUST BE FOLLOWED IMMEDIATELY\n\n7a. If the lights go out stay as silent as possible, there is a chance you will hear sniffing, if this happens do not move at all. After following this you will be safe and back to normal in about 30 minutes.\n\n7b. If you break rule 7a It is too late, THEY have got you. Refer to 'Rule 8'.\n\n8. They have found your scent and you will not return.",

        "text": "I’m crying as I run.  Not just crying, but snotting and whining like a hurt animal, each burning breath more of a wet sob that gets thinner and thinner the farther I go.  I don’t understand what I just saw, what just happened to Ellie, but at the same time, I do.  Not with my brain maybe, but some part of me, even at ten, understands that we had crossed the threshold into something *other*, something *wrong*, and now I had to find my way back across for my sake and for hers.\n\nIt seemed forever before the woods felt like normal woods again, though maybe I just didn’t notice at first.  I was focused on keeping up speed and not curving off into a confused circle that would take me back to that strange garden and to the thing that had her.  When I stepped out past the trees, I recognized the spot immediately.  I was just down the road from a gas station Dad stopped at some times when he was surveying out this way.  They could help me get our parents, get the police even.\n\nSo wiping my face and ignoring the burning stitch growing in my side, I stepped on the fog line and started back to running.\n\n**** \n\n“You’re so slow.”\n\nI could hear the good-natured laughter in Ellie’s voice when she said it, but it still burned a little.  She was twelve to my ten, but I was starting to realize she wasn’t just my best friend, because I had a crush on her too.  I’d have died if she knew, of course, so I never mentioned it or tried to let it show.  Still, in the last few months I had found myself trying to act tougher about things, more grown up.  And when she poked fun, which she rarely did, I noticed it a bit more than I had before.\n\nThis time, I just grunted in irritation.  “You’re a giant.  Your legs are twice as long.”  This part was somewhat true—while she was no giant, she was half a foot taller than me and way faster at the best of times.  This wasn’t the best of times.  We’d been hiking through increasingly thick woods for half an hour, and not only was I getting tired, but some areas were so steep or choked with bushes that I just had trouble keeping up.  \n\nI half-expected another sarcastic comment, but instead she slowed down and put out her hand for me to grab as I reached a snarl of twisted branches that she’d easily vaulted over.  Giving me a grin, she waggled her fingers.  “That’s true.  You’ll catch up though.”  Returning her smile, I took the offered hand and made it past this latest barrier with an awkward hop.  I barely stuck the landing, my feet sliding on wet leaves, and I glanced up at her with embarrassment before realizing she wasn’t looking at me any more.\n\nShe was looking at the garden.\n\nFifty yards away, surrounded by dark woods but somehow separate from them, was a thick wall of hedges punctuated by an open archway that contained a door of dull, red metal like an old penny.  Not a solid door, but one made of crisscrosses and winding layers of…well, now I’d call it copper, though I don’t think that’s quite right either.  And on one side of the door was a knob made not of metal but a smoky gray curling lever of wood, filigreed with symbols that felt slippery somehow, whether you were looking at them or trying to recall what they were later on.  Below that lever was a small box that looked like a lock without a keyhole.  I took all this in as we walked closer, my eyes drinking in every detail it could find and keep as my heart began to speed up.  This is special, its beat said.  This is magic.\n\nI jumped when I heard a sharp whirring noise beyond the gateway that led into the garden.  For some reason I didn’t look past the door to the source of the sound, but instead I looked at Ellie.  Her eyes were already in the center of that place, watching the thing that was sitting up and staring at us through the red door.  I expected her face to show the same uncertainty I was feeling, but she didn’t look uncertain at all, or even a little worried or afraid.  She just looked terribly, terribly happy in a way that made me wonder if I’d ever really seen her look happy before that moment.  I followed her gaze to find what had affected her so.\n\nIt was a mechanical man, at least at first glance.  It had a metal torso with two arms of twisting wires and joints that twitched and shuddered in time with a cold ratcheting sound that came from somewhere deeper inside.  It was sitting on a long stone bench with one leg on each side, and some part of my brain whispered that its legs weren’t right—the swirls of shifting metal were covered in thick grey moss that almost looked like matted fur, but I could still see that the knees bent backwards and terminated in sharp steel hooves.\n\nI was still staring at those hooves when it turned and looked at us.\n\nIts eyes were dark pits that would occasionally flicker with amber light, and like everything else about it, that orange flame kept time with some internal rhythm that would give it brief life every tick and tock.  I sucked in a terrified breath even as it made a small hissing sound followed by a rapidly speeding up whir. \n\n*Come in, children.*\n\nI started stepping back, and that was my first mistake.  I’d assumed Ellie was as freaked out as I was, but when I was out of the way, she immediately gripped the wooden knob of the door and pulled it open, stepping inside before I could even cry out.  I had time to catch the door before it shut, but my fear made me hesitate, and instead I just called out to her from my spot a few feet back from the archway.\n\n“Ellie!  No!  Get out of there!”\n\nShe turned to look at me, a strange smile on her face.  “No, it’s okay.  I remember this now.  I remember this place from my dream.  That’s why I knew we had to come here.”\n\nIt had been her idea to go hiking there, and she’d been insistent about the direction we went and the pace we kept, but I hadn’t thought much about it at the time.  Still, even if she *had* dreamed about this place, how did that make it better or safer?  “It could be dangerous.  We don’t know what…”\n\n*I will not harm you, children.*\n\nEllie glanced at me again as though to say “see?” and then finished the distance to the bench where the creature sat waiting.  Moving closer to the door, I looked around at the rest of the garden, afraid there might be more of those things lurking somewhere.  It was a relatively small space—a fifty foot circle bounded by hedges and this singular door, and inside the circle, four benches at each of the cardinal directions surrounding an ancient-looking stone fountain that had long since gone dry.  Moss and ivy competed for space on the fountain itself and the moldering bricks that flowed out from it, but other than that and the creature on the nearest bench, I saw no other signs of life.  It was as my eyes went back to Ellie that I realized she was sitting down on the other end of the bench from the thing, straddling it like it was.  I went to call to her again, tell her to come back, but the metal voice spun to life.\n\n*Would you like to play a game?*\n\nI could only see Ellie’s face in profile now, but it was enough to see that something was wrong.  *Had* to be wrong.  How could she get so close to that thing and not be scared?  Instead she looked happy and excited, nodding and saying yes as soon as the creature finished speaking.\n\n*Excellent.*  It reached to its chest and pulled out something round.  A large coin.  With a kind of twitching flourish, it showed the coin to Ellie and then to me, twirling it with inhuman dexterity to show us both sides.  On one side was a thin woman’s face smiling in the glow of rays of sunshine.  On the other was the same woman, staring with hatred up at the moon.  It struck me later that even with its attempts to show off the coin, I should have been too far away to see it clearly, but I had, whether with my eyes or something it put in my head…I saw it clearly and it sent a chill up my spine.  \n\n“Ellie, don’t d…”\n\n*Just a staring contest.  We will stare until one gives up or the coin falls.*  With that, it put the coin between them and set it to spinning on the bench even as its amber eyes found Ellie’s and began to flare brighter.  Looking back to her, I saw her eyes were locked in as well.\n\nThe contest had begun.\n\nI thought about calling out again or going into the garden myself, but I was afraid of what might happen if I interrupted the game or distracted her.  What if she lost?  What would happen then?  So I watched through the door, on the verge of tears, as the coin danced in a small twirling circle and my best friend and the monster held each other’s gaze.\n\nI don’t know how much time passed before I realized it was going on too long.  The coin was still spinning with no signs of slowing down, and Ellie was no longer smiling, her face becoming pale and drawn as she continued to look into the creature’s eyes without blinking.  And when she spoke, her voice was trembling and afraid.\n\n“I…I can’t stop.  I can’t look away.  Or close my eyes.  Is…is the coin still going?”\n\nI glanced down and then back up to her.  “Yeah.  It’s still spinning like it won’t ever stop.”  I gripped the bars of the door harder.  “Can’t you just get up and come back here?”  I felt like I already knew the answer, but I had to ask.\n\n“No.  I can’t do anything but look into it.  I don’t want to…I don’t want to look into it any more.”  I saw a thin line of tears sliding down her cheek now, and it stirred enough momentary anger and courage in me that I grabbed the knob and tried to turn it.  It didn’t move at all.\n\n“It…the door, it’s locked now.  I can’t get it to open!”  I glared at the monster.  “Open this door, you bastard!”\n\nAnother whir and then, *I cannot.  It can only be opened from the outside one way.  From the inside, one way.*\n\n“Okay, how do I open it then?”\n\n*To open it from the outside, one must only truly want to come inside.  You do not, so it will not.*\n\nEllie was shaking a little now.  “Please…help me….”\n\nSwallowing, I gave the knob another weak twist before letting my hand fall.  I couldn’t quite make myself look at Ellie now, so I just stared at the broken bricks between me and her.  “I’ll go get your folks.  Get somebody that can help.  I’ll be back, I promise.”  I meant every bit of it, but it didn’t make me feel like less of a coward.  And when I started to run, I wonder how much I was running toward help and how much I was just running away from what I was leaving behind.\n\n**** \n\nI reached the gas station, and after a couple of minutes of hysterical yelling from me, the lady behind the counter got enough to call our parents and the sheriff.  I told them all that Ellie had gotten stuck in a place deep in the woods, and I went with our families and the deputies to try and show them where.  It shouldn’t have been that hard—we’d explored parts of those woods before, and while we’d never gone in so deep, I remembered the way clear enough.  But every time I thought we were nearing the garden, there would just be more trees or small clearings with nothing there.  We stayed out there until it got dark, me getting more and more frustrated and upset as I tried to lead them to Ellie.\n\nEventually my mother took me home.  People searched those woods for another week.  They brought in dogs and a helicopter, but nothing helped.  I was talked to several more times, and eventually I broke down and told them about the garden and the thing inside, even though I knew they’d think I was lying or crazy.  And they did.  First they were angry, then they were sad.  I think there was even a time where people wondered if I’d hurt Ellie somehow.  But there was no proof of that, so by the end of that summer, I was being home schooled between therapy sessions while Ellie’s parents went back into the woods every weekend to search for their little girl.\n\nWe moved away that next spring.  By then I’d learned to say I’d just lost track of Ellie in the woods and that all the rest was just me being a scared and traumatized kid.  I didn’t believe that at first, but in time I did, if only because it was so much easier.  And over the years, I’ve gone from thinking about her every day to every week or two to hardly at all.\n\nAnd then last week, I dreamed of the garden.\n\nI don’t know if it was the same dream Ellie had, and I didn’t remember the details of it when I woke up, but that didn’t stop me from sensing the change.  A door had opened somewhere inside me, and all the memories of it I’d tried to forget and deny had come crawling back out.  I spent the next few minutes crying quietly next to my sleeping girlfriend before getting up to book a flight back to where I left my childhood behind.\n\nThe town looked different and alien as I traveled through it, and the gas station was now a restaurant that seemed to have been closed for some time.  Parking at the edge of its lot, I walked back up the road to where I’d come running out of the woods that day.  Sucking in a deep breath, I headed back inside.\n\nIn comparison to the town itself, the woods seemed very familiar and unchanged.  I’d told myself a hundred times that this was all pointless if it had all happened.  I hadn’t been able to find my way back as a kid, and I wouldn’t be able to now.\n\nBut as soon as I started going deeper in, I knew that wasn’t true.  I recognized several landmarks, but more than that, I just knew which way was the right way, whether from memory, the dream, or some magnetic pull from something in the heart of that place.  Heart thudding in my chest, I went faster and faster, and before noon I’d stepped over a stand of bushes and turned to see the hedge wall a few feet away.\n\nThe air seemed to go out of me then, and each breath was a thin wisp I had to fight for as I forced myself forward to where I expected the arch and the door to be.  It was there, of course, and beyond it, I saw…\n\n*Oh my God.*\n\nIt was Ellie.  Her hair was long and streaked with white, but her face and body were that of a twenty-eight year old woman—still two years older than me.  Her clothes had long-since rotted away, and bits of ivy and moss draped across her in some places, but her skin was otherwise unblemished except for her face, which had a worn, darker crease in the flesh from the corner of her eye down to the edge of her jaw.  Her eyes were still locked forward, bound to the twitching amber gaze of the thing that sat across from her.\n\nEllie was so still that for a moment I wondered if she was even alive.  How could she be, having stayed in this place for all this time?  How was any of this possible?\n\nBut then I saw her chest stir slightly with a small, ragged breath and I let out a sob as I cried out to her.\n\n“Ellie?  Oh, I’m so sorry, Ellie.  Are you…”\n\n*Hello, young man.  Good to see you again.*\n\nShuddering, I forced myself to look at the thing.  “Please.  Please let her go.”\n\n*I cannot.  Only you can.*\n\nI reached for the wooden knob, and this time it turned easily.  Swinging the door open, I started to step inside when something stopped me.  I looked back at Ellie.  “Can you move now?  I’ve got the door open.  Can you make it to me?”\n\nEllie’s face twitched slightly, and though she didn’t move her eyes, I could feel her focused on me.  Throat jumping, she tried to make a noise, maybe say something, but all that came was a small hoarse whisper I couldn’t make out.\n\n*That will not work, young man.  The door can only be opened one way from the outside.  It can only be opened one way from the inside.  And those that enter or exit must abide those same rules.*\n\n\nFrowning, I tried to understand what it was saying.  Being careful with my wording, I spoke to the thing.  “So I can open the door because I wanted to enter and I can enter so long as I want to enter.  Is that what you mean?”  \n\nA rasping whir and then:  *Correct.*\n\n“Okay.  Um.  So now that the door is open, can’t I just get her and carry her back out?”\n\n*Incorrect.  The door can only be opened one way from the inside and only one that opens it that way may leave.*\n\nI wanted to scream I was frustrated and terrified, but I forced myself to stay as calm as I could.  I needed to understand if I was going to help her get out.  “So for Ellie to leave, she has to be the one to open the door from the inside?”\n\n*Correct.*\n\n“But how the fuck is she going to do that?  She can’t stop looking at you or even move.  How do you open the door from the inside?”\n\n[*It’s coin-operated.*](https://redd.it/lfni9i)\n\nMy stomach turned to ice as I looked down at the inside of the door.  On that side, the metal box beneath the handle held a large slot like you might find on a machine that accepted coins.  I looked back at them.\n\nAnd the coin that spun endlessly in-between.\n\n“Can she take the coin?  Stop it and take it?  Use it in the door?”\n\n*She cannot.  Nor can I.  Only another can stop it.  Take it.  Give it to her.  Give it to me.  Or take it for themselves. Each coin has a singular purpose and a singular use.*\n\nI felt my hand trembling on the door.  “So if I go in and stop the coin and give it to her, she would be free?  She would be able to open the door and leave?”\n\n*Correct.*\n\n“But…what would happen to me?  Would I be trapped in there without a coin to get out?”\n\nA longer whir and then:  *I would produce another coin for another spin.  Another contest.  This time it would be with you.*\n\n“So I would be stuck in there unless someone else came and stopped the new coin.  Gave it to me and took my place.”\n\n*Correct.*\n\n“Or I’d have to stare at you until I die of old age?”\n\nThere was a tinkle of chimes from somewhere in its metal bones that reminded me of laughter. \n\n*Oh no.  I have many games.  I would find us another.*  A louder jangle of notes and then.  *You should come in and shut the door.  See what I can show you.*\n\nI was already stepping back as my eyes found Ellie again.  The dark track in her cheek was glistening with fresh tears and she tried to say something again, but her lips would only spasm as a desperate, wordless hiss escaped.  I didn’t have any words left either.  Just terror and guilt and more than a little relief as I shut the door to the garden again for the last time.\n\nDespite my fear, I did hold onto that door for a few moments.  I tried to summon the strength to tell her I was sorry.  To lie to her and promise I’d come back.  But the apology would be for me and she deserved better than my lies.  In the end, I couldn’t even look up at her.  I just pushed against the door to make sure it was secure before backing away a few feet and turning to run.\n\nI didn’t stop running until I was back in my car.  Didn’t stop shaking until I was boarding the flight back home.  And when my girlfriend asked how my trip had gone, I lied and told her everything had been fine.\n\nI’ll lie to myself too.  Tell myself I dreamed all this, or if I can’t swallow that, that I went for a hike in the woods where I once lost a childhood friend, and while I was out there, I let my imagination run wild.  That may sound weak or cowardly, but I don’t care.  You can’t judge me.\n\nI’ve seen the real world.  The world *behind* the world.  And trust me, if you ever see it, you don’t look it in the eye.\n\n[Because it can swallow you whole.](https://redd.it/109j6wn)",

        "text": "I smiled at the cashier as she replaced the receipt paper.\n\n“Sorry, these things just take a second to start up again!” She said with a nervous chuckle as she stood waiting for the machine to print off a throw-away section of the paper.\n\n“No worries!” I said with a smile. “I’ve worked retail before and always hated changing out the receipt paper, so I totally get it.”\n\nShe nodded politely, her shoulders relaxing a little. \n\n“There we go.” She said as she ripped my receipt from the printer and handed it to me. \n\n“Have a nice day and enjoy those cookies!” She smiled, gesturing at one of my bags.\n\n“You too!” I blushed a little realizing my error. “Well, you also have a nice day, I mean!”\n\nShe snorted a little and gave me a polite waive as I walked away from her register. \n\nAs my steps carried me toward the exit, I looked down at my receipt to check if all my items were accounted for. There wasn’t much in the 3 bags I carried, but ever since getting stopped at the door from the security scanners going off on me one time a few years ago, it had become a bit of a paranoia-driven habit. Continuing slowly toward the exit, my face remained transfixed on the small piece of paper while I mentally read off each product it listed. Once I verified everything was in order, my gaze shifted upward toward the exit.\n\nBut as my focus returned to my surroundings, I furrowed my brow in confusion and stopped dead in my tracks. I wasn’t looking at the exit/entrance area like I’d expected. Instead, a completely blank wall stood blocking the usual path out of the building. Staring stupidly at the empty wall for a moment, I attempted to wrap my head around what I was looking at. Had I taken a wrong turn while my attention was focused on the receipt? That seemed the only explanation. Unsure of what to do, I turned back toward the store checkout to get a better handle on my situation.\n\nBut the next sight was equally as unexpected. All of the checkout area was completely desolate. No customers in the self-checkout, no cashiers scanning products or politely speaking to customers, nothing. I turned my head toward the small coffee shop that sat to the left of the registers and saw that even though I could have sworn I heard coffee brewing and baristas working only a moment before, it too was now devoid of life. \n\nA sense of dread began gnawing at the edges of my skull, but I did my best to ignore it. This must have been some kind of mistake, I thought. But, even if all the people that were only minutes ago standing at the cash registers or sitting in the coffee shop were collectively in on some elaborate prank, that still didn’t explain how the exit/entrance was now seemingly nonexistent. \n\nThe concerning paranoia hung heavily in my mind as I walked back over to the registers to inspect them. But despite checking around every last one, I still found absolutely no signs of life. I could now feel the heightening anxiety eat its way past the bone and begin sinking its gnarled teeth into the soft jello of my brain as I struggled not to let panic overcome me. With haste, I made my way to the security office where I was met with a thick, solid looking gray door. Hesitating for a moment, I looked behind me and scanned one last time for any other people. When I still failed to locate anyone, I turned back to the ominous door and knocked on it. \n\nA long and uncomfortable silence was all the response I received for my tapping. So, I tried again, harder this time. Still nothing. One last time, I pounded rapidly against the door and yelled, “Hello?! Is someone there? Please?!” But still I received no reply.\n\nMy fears at last consumed my mind in its entirety and I frantically ran to the coffee shop and slammed on the bell that sat on its counter. “Hello?! HELLO?! Anyone?!” \n\nWhen that too failed to yield results, I searched the bathrooms that were located nearby. But even after kicking in every last stall door and screaming for anyone to answer, I still didn’t find a single soul. \n\nAfter exiting the bathrooms, I quietly walked over to the wall where the exit should have been and slumped against it with my back, slowly sliding down until I was sitting upon the scuffed, dirty floor. I stared absent-mindedly down the long and empty walkway that led to the clothing department, unsure of how next I should proceed. Something was clearly wrong here, that much was obvious. This was not simply some prank or mistake. Whatever was going on, wherever I was now, I was alone, and I was trapped.\n\nI’m not ashamed to say I had a full on breakdown at that point. Just sitting on the hard epoxy, leaned against the wall, holding my knees and sobbing like a child. This situation should have been impossible. Things like this didn’t happen in real life, it just didn’t make any sense. \n\nAfter a few minutes of crying and trying to wrap my head around the circumstances, I at last stood to my feet and wiped the remaining tears from my face, “Dammit, get it together my dude!” I told myself, slapping my cheek in an attempt to bring myself back to reality. For the moment, it seemed I had recovered at least some degree of sanity as I once again scanned my surroundings. I decided that there had to be some way out of whatever this was, even if the answer wasn’t obvious to me at that moment.\n\nMaking my way past the registers, I looked down the main path to the grocery section. I took a deep breath to prepare myself, then began walking.\n\nMy plan was simple, the store wasn’t really all that big. So I reasoned that if I headed down the main walkway and glanced down every aisle, it wouldn’t take me long to have searched practically the entire place. It felt unlikely I’d actually find another person, but it was the only thing I could think to do. And if I didn’t want to go completely insane, I had to do something. \n\nWith that in mind, I slowly and methodically worked my way toward the grocery section. I walked by aisle after aisle, still finding no signs of life. In addition, I tried my best to listen for any sounds that might lead me to another person. After I’d gotten about halfway to the groceries, I yelled out, “Hello? Is anyone there?” hoping to get any kind of response. Sadly, my efforts were wasted. It truly seemed like the store was entirely deserted. \n\nAfter a few minutes of keeping a slow pace, I finally found myself standing in the freezer area of the grocery department. That meant I’d made my way through about a third of the store and still didn’t see or hear another lifeform. My vision momentarily blurred from tears as I nearly let my fear consume me again, but I quickly wiped them away. I knew that if there was any chance of me figuring out what was going on, I couldn’t afford to lose myself again, not yet at least. \n\nWith a somewhat weak resolve, I steadied myself and kept moving forward. But as I walked by the last freezer aisle something caught my eye, causing me to doubletake. Quickly, I took a step back and poked my head around the edge of the freezers to see a figure. I nearly gasped in excitement. \n\n“H-hey!” I shouted as I jogged down the cold aisle toward them.\n\n“Thank goodness I found another person! I was just beginning to think I was alo-” my words caught in my throat as my legs suddenly refused to take me any closer to the shape. \n\nNow standing just several feet from the figure, I could make them out clearly, and my heart sank as I realized what I was talking to. It was a mannequin. A fully dressed, white plastic, mannequin. \n\n“What?” Is all the English I could muster as I studied the thing. Adorned in red basketball shorts and a black jersey, it looked as though the thing had walked straight here from the men’s athletic wear department. But as strange as it was to find it here, there was something more unnerving about the mannequin than just its presence. What really unsettled me, was what it was holding in its left hand. Meat. A package of shredded beef, to be exact. \n\n“You making some tacos, buddy?” I asked with a nervous chuckle, almost expecting a reply.\n\nWhen none came, I glanced around us to see that we were both standing in the meat section. I stared at the plastic figure for a moment, as if trying to catch some hidden, subtle movement. It didn’t shift in the slightest, but despite its lack of animation my nerves still got the better of me, and I found myself cautiously backing away from the unsettling sight and out of the aisle. \n\nNow properly disturbed, I quickened my pace through the rest of the food department in an attempt to distance myself from its unusual customer. Finding myself back in the retail section of the store, I relaxed just a little. But only seconds after, I heard a loud clammer coming from only a few aisle down. It sounded like something fell off of a shelf. Believing that it had to be another person, I shouted, “Hey!” And ran toward the source of the abrupt sound.\n\nWhen I turned the corner of the row the noise had come from I stopped. There, laying on the floor in the center of the aisle were a handful of action figures and other toys that had fallen from their place on a nearby fixture. As I approached the products, it was clear from a look at the disheveled shelf that these items didn’t just end up on the floor because of gravity. Someone, or something had swiped them out of place and onto the floor. \n\nA chuckle escaped my lips. Then another. Soon I was full blown laughing. “O-okay!” I said, trying to catch my breath. “Holy shit, you got me! You got me good! You can come out now, prank’s over!”\n\nAfter again receiving no reply my laughter quickly died. “Hey! Seriously?! How long are you going to keep this up?!” I yelled, now more angry than I was scared. \n\n“Are you fucking kidding me?” I grumbled to myself when I yet again got no response. \n\nShaking my head in frustration and turning my attention back to the toys scattered on the floor, I bent down to inspect them. Picking one up and looking it over, I was reminded of a fondness I used to have for this line of action figures when I was growing up. Despite my current situation, I let myself reminisce for a moment and a small smile formed at the corner of my mouth. But only a second later a quick scuffling noise from ahead of me pulled me cruelly back to the present day. \n\nMy eyes darted upward to see the source of the disruption, and the discovery brought me back to the peak of fear. Standing there, only about 20 feet or so away, was another horribly expressionless mannequin. I shot to my feet, dropping the toy back to the ground below. For a moment, I did nothing. My body stood as still as the lifeless figure before me and I gazed into the part of its smooth, shiny skull that its eyes would have been. Then, after some sense had come back to me, I began walking backwards away from it. But as I turned to sprint out of the aisle the way I’d entered, I nearly tripped at the sight before me. There on the opposite end of the row the mannequin stood on, was its equally as appalling twin. \n\nPanic rose in my chest as I began hyperventilating. “O-okay! You fucking got me again! Please, I can’t take it anymore!” I cried to whomever must be pulling the strings of this elaborate and terrible joke. Only a second after the words left my lips, however, I heard another scuffling sound from behind me. Jerking my head over my shoulder, I saw that the first mannequin had gotten a few feet closer. No sooner than I’d registered this, another scuffle came from the opposite end of the aisle. My head twisted like it was on a swivel back to the second plastic figure to see that it too was now a step closer. Then, more noise from the other end and a quick, bone snapping twist of my neck showed the first awful mannequin was even closer now. \n\nThe two of them were getting nearer with every turn of my head, but I dared not to take the time to try and understand how it was happening. Before I could even think, my hands shot for the shelves. Knocking aside dozens of products, I climbed as fast as my frantic limbs would carry me up the cluttered fixtures. As I did, I could hear the familiar scuffling from both sides of the aisle growing closer. In my panic I carelessly misplaced a foot on top of a toy, causing it to slide out from underneath me, nearly taking me down with it. Letting out a small whimper of panic, I scrambled to recover and scurried up the highest shelf. Any sooner and I may have been a dead man, because just as I began pulling my dangling leg up to the top shelf I could swear I felt cold, plastic fingers just graze against my ankle. \n\nI didn’t look back to see my pursuers. Instead, I jumped across the next aisle to the top of more shelves, kicking aside more useless objects as I landed. Then, I hopped one more aisle after that. Thinking it might finally be safe to get down, I did so. After hopping down and nearly breaking my leg in the process, I wasted no time, going into a full sprint almost as soon as my feet touched the ground. Making a split-second decision, I ran straight to the nearest section with the most cover, the clothing department, and leapt inside a rack of low hanging clearance shirts to hide.\n\nCarefully steadying the shaking hangers as they swung from the force of my entry, I made myself as small as possible. Every ounce of my being prayed that the mannequins hadn’t seen me duck into the clothes. I couldn’t stop myself from picturing a cold, plastic arm reaching into my hiding space and wrapping its icy hands around my neck. So after a moment, my own hands quietly spread some of the shirts apart to give me at least a thin slit of sight. Looking down the main walkway from which I came, I saw no movement. But still my nerves wouldn’t settle, and I decided to wait in my cramped cotton sanctuary for just a few more minutes.\n\nAfter what I’d estimate was about five minutes, it was time to try my luck. Slowly and silently, I crept out from the clearance rack. My eyes darted in every direction to make sure I wasn’t seen. For now at least, it appeared to be safe. Despite not spotting any immediate threats, I kept low to the ground and maneuvered behind shelves and clothes in a semi-crouched fashion, looking over my shoulder with nearly every step. \n\nWhat the hell do I do now? I thought to myself. Tears fogged my vision as terror began to strangle my psyche again, but once again I rubbed them away with my shirt sleeve. There had to be some way out, there just *had* to be.\n\nWith that thought, I surveyed my surroundings from my position near the back of the men’s clothing department. It wasn’t long before something caught my eye. Just beyond the counter where an employee usually sat was a short hallway with several small dressing rooms. But while the dressing rooms themselves didn’t interest me, what lay at the back of the narrow hallway did. \n\nA set of large, red double doors stood tucked beyond the tiny rooms. That’s when I remembered that this was a retail store, and retail stores always had backrooms where they store overflow of goods and take in shipments. I thought maybe that was my ticket out of this nightmare. If I could make it through those doors, I’d at least have a shot at another exit of some kind.\n\nWith the decision made, I stealthily crawled behind clothing display after clothing display as I headed for the dressing rooms. Every small noise I created made me cringe. As my feet slowly stepped closer and closer to the dressing rooms, the feeling that something was watching me got stronger and stronger. It had been a little bit since I’d seen any plastic figures, but I knew there would be more of them. To make matters worse, the constant checking of my surroundings was making my progress painfully slow. But it felt necessary. The last thing I wanted was to be caught off guard by one of those things again.\n\nDespite my increasing paranoia and snail pace, I eventually made it to the hallway of dressing rooms with no incident. Slipping behind the counter, I carefully looked over it from my crouching position. When I still didn’t see anything following me, I half-stood and swiftly walked to the red doors at the back of the hall. Upon reaching them, I placed a hand against one and stared at its intimidating color. I took a deep breath, preparing myself for whatever may lay ahead, and pushed the door open.\n\nIt took longer than I’d like to admit for me to fully recognize what sat on the other side of the swinging doors. But when I did, my knees buckled and I fell hard upon them. Standing on the other side of the ominous red doors was not a safe-haven, nor was it a storage area or a place to take in shipment. What stood mockingly on the other side of the doors was nothing but a barren, dull brick wall.\n\nThis was a joke. A sick, twisted joke. The door opened up into what stood past it with just enough space to not bump into the brick wall, and that was it. I was looking at nothing but a closet with fancy doors. \n\nDespair momentarily overtook my common sense and my eyes welled with tears once more. The hopelessness of my circumstances strangling me, I let out an involuntary sob which echoed loudly down and out of the dressing room hallway. By the time I realized my mistake and my hands shot to my mouth to muffle the noise, it was too late. Then, suddenly, a quick scuffling sound reverberated from behind me. I immediately jerked my head to the start of the hall only to see what I had most feared, another, horrible mannequin. It simply stood at the opposite end of the hall, staring back at me with an eyeless gaze. \n\nInstinctively rising to my feet, I engaged in the most horrifying staring contest of my life. For a moment, the two of us just stayed there like that. I thought the thing might be waiting for me to make a move, but then something hit me. All the mannequins that I’d seen seemed to only move when I wasn’t looking at them. Did that mean they couldn’t move while I kept my eyes on them? \n\nCautiously, I took a step toward the awful thing. When it did nothing, I took another. Still, no reaction. A small, hopeful smirk formed on my face. I didn’t know much about these plastic beings, but it seemed this was their weakness. Pressing myself against the wall, I began making my way toward the thing in hopes of moving past it. All the while, I kept my eyes firmly upon its horrible, faceless head. The distance between us grew smaller and smaller until after an excruciating minute, I was nearly past it. My heart pounded like a drum in my chest as I inched forward, still not taking my eyes off the figure. Finally, after another seemingly eternal stretch of time, I had gotten nearly my entire body beyond it. My heart-rate began to slow just a little as I took the final step. Realizing I’d been holding my breath, I let it out shakily. Then, just as I began to let my guard down, the thing’s horrible arm twisted rapidly at an impossible speed and grabbed my wrist.\n\nAn involuntary gasp choked its way free from my lips as the realization of my miscalculation washed cruelly over me. With a single, swift motion, the mannequin then spun its head nearly 360 degrees to face me. Through blurry, wet eyes I gazed back at it in abject horror as I watched a small, vertical black line form up its entire face. Confused and terrified, I wrestled with the cold, plastic hand in an attempt to pull myself from its grip, all the while keeping my eyes locked on the odd blemish upon its face. The monster’s body began twisting and convulsing awkwardly like a character in a stop-motion film as the dark slit grew wider and wider. Then, with one final, awful snap, its face split open entirely. \n\nSat within the now gaping facial cavity, was an impossible number of short, jagged teeth. Shiny red gums reflected the bright, buzzing lights that sat above us, and a disgustingly large tongue snaked its way out of a throat hole that appeared far too small to fit such a large muscle. \n\nConsciously, I knew it was a mistake, but my brain simply could not handle the level of uncanny horror that my eyes registered, and a scream of deep, utter fear clawed its way painfully out of my throat. Seemingly in response, the horrible mannequin creature squeezed my wrist, causing my scream to turn into a whimper of agony. \n\n“W-what the fuck do you want from me?!” I found myself asking as the abomination's hard white fingers pressed into my bone. Its answer shouldn’t have surprised me, but I still felt shell shocked when a scratchy, inhuman voice replied simply with, “Flessshhhh!” \n\nSuddenly the memory of the first entity I’d seen came flooding back to me. I didn’t think much of it at the time, but now staring into the red, swollen mouth of one of these monstrosities, I at last understood why the first mannequin had been holding a package of raw beef. \n\nNo sooner than the realization came to me, I observed my fist planting itself hard into the plastic face of the mannequin. It seemed my fight or flight instinct had kicked in, and with no way to run, my body reacted with what it thought best. Surprisingly, the solid right hook to the thing’s plastic shell sent it stumbling backwards, causing it to release my wrist in the process. \n\nI winced as the feeling began coming back to my left hand, but wasted no time in getting the hell away from the monster that now lay sprawled upon the carpet. Not bothering to hide, I began running toward the women’s clothing department. But before I couldn’t even get two steps out of the men’s section, 3 mannequins darted from behind dress displays and ran in an almost cartoony fashion toward me. \n\n“Shit!” I hissed, turning away from them and sprinting toward the shoe department instead. But almost as soon as I was about to turn into an aisle, a shiny white arm swung from around the corner and tried to grab me. I managed to dodge it, only barely stopping myself from falling over in the process. Quickly changing my direction again, I headed for the electronics this time. But it was no good. As I approached the display cell phones I spotted at least 5 more figures scattered throughout the section waiting for me. \n\n“Shit, shit, shit!” I panted in desperation. With no other choice I ran full speed back toward the grocery department. As I did, a series of mangled, plastic limbs shot out from various aisles attempting to catch me. A few managed to grab loose sections of my shirt, but thankfully slipped off from the velocity of my sprinting. Unsure of where to go, I continued down toward the freezer section where I’d seen the first mannequin hungrily eyeing shredded beef. As soon as I remembered it again, an idea came to me, and I turned into the meat aisle. \n\nNot slowing down in time for the sudden change in direction, I slammed my right shoulder into the corner freezer. Doing my best to ignore the pain, I began opening each freezer door I could get my hands on as quickly as possible. I began grabbing and pulling at various raw meat products, throwing them to the floor and moving down the aisle as I did. By the time I reached the opposite end of it, the floor was absolutely covered in meat.\n\nOnly a second after I looked back, I saw a crowd of over a dozen plastic bodies hurl themselves into the aisle. To my surprise, most of them had spotted the meat strewn across the floor and almost immediately pounced on it. Horrified, I watched in disgust as the multitude of mannequins split their faces open and began devouring the raw products like a pack of starved wolves. An assortment of plastic, red stained limbs clawed at the packaging. Awful, twisted bodies stumbled and tripped over one another in a rabid attempt to consume as much meat as possible before the others could get to it. The desperation in the air was thick as teeth ripped away at plastic and product alike with almost no discrimination. \n\nFor the briefest of moments as I watched the nightmarish scene, I nearly let myself believe my half-baked plan was successful. But when my eyes met the cracked, dented face of a lone mannequin standing at the other end of the aisle, the small relief I’d felt dissolved instantly. Without further hesitation, I ran. My gaze shot to the opposite end of each aisle I passed only to see the angry creature keeping pace with me. It was obvious that it wasn’t happy with me for punching it square in the face earlier, and now it seemed only the meat on my bones would satiate its enraged appetite.\n\nCompletely unaware of where my panicked feet were taking me, I looked forward and spotted a desk with a set of caged windows. It didn’t take me but a second to understand we were heading for the pharmacy. As soon as I laid my eyes on it I knew what my next course of action would be. If I could get behind the counter, I might be able to block the door from the other side, then I would be completely protected from the mannequins at least. But it was risky. The door that led behind the counter could have been locked, and if it was, I was as good as dead. \n\nDeciding to throw all my cards on the table, I slammed straight into the pharmacy door with all my weight. Looking down to the other end of that last aisle filled with pills and ointments I could see the broken face of the mannequin staring daggers into me, as if daring me to try. I hesitated for just a second, gazing back at the thing’s vertical mouth as its edges curved into what I assume was a sinister smile. As soon as its feet began moving toward me, however, my hand twisted the knob, hoping against all odds that the door was unlocked. To my great relief, it was, and I threw myself into the small, secure pill bottle packing room. \n\nNo sooner than I slammed the door, there was a loud pound from the other side. Then another, and another, all the while I pressed my full weight into it and held the doorknob firmly in a tight grip to keep it from moving. As the pounding continued, I reached up above the knob and locked the deadbolt, then, I quickly grabbed a large fixture filled with pill bottles and pushed it against the door with all my strength. \n\nRelatively confident that the door would hold for now, I backed away from it and pressed myself against the opposite wall. I’d thought that the mannequin would give up after a moment, but the pouding never stopped. That thing was determined to get in here, and I had no idea how long the door could resist. To make matters worse, a loud metal scraping sound echoed through the room as another one of the horrible creatures slammed against one of the caged off windows. Soon after another joined it, then another. It didn’t take long for every window to be covered in ravenous, blood-cloaked bodies. \n\nCollectively, they gnawed and pulled at the cages over the windows, their mouths now dripping with meat and blood from my diversion only minutes ago. It seemed they’d made short work of the appetizers I’d thrown on the floor and were now ready for the main course. \n\nHopelessly, I sank to the floor, sobbing and screaming. I knew it was only a matter of time before the mannequins got in. Despite all my efforts, it felt like I had lost this twisted game I found myself playing. But in a last ditch effort to survive, my eyes searched through tears for something I could use as a weapon. Instead, however, they met the red glow of an electronic sign. Wiping some of the wet from my face I read, “EXIT” in large, neon letters. Shakily I stood and walked over to it, gazing at the red door that sat ominously beneath the words. \n\nIt couldn’t be. It had to be another trick like before. I would open it and be met with another brick wall or something and my fate would be sealed. But what if it wasn’t a trick? What if it really was my ticket out of here?\n\nJust as I began to consider my options, a loud crash suddenly erupted from behind me and I turned to see that one of the cages over the windows had been ripped clean off. I looked back to the door, its surface glowing beneath the gentle hum of the exit sign. Then, I glanced over my shoulder at the mannequins once more. Their fists slammed hard against the window, and from my vantage point I could make out cracks beginning to form in the glass. Anxiously I twisted my head back to the door, terrified of the possibility that it was a trap. But then the sound of splintering glass grew louder and louder. Frantically, I looked behind me again to now see the mannequin I’d decked earlier punching the weakest section of the window, and I knew I had little time to make my choice. \n\nA second later the sound of shattering glass erupted through the small room and the decision was made for me. My hands pressed against the push bar of the emergency exit with all the strength I could muster.\n\nAs I pressed it open, a thin ray of light poured into the room. I didn’t even have time to register relief as I practically fell through the door and onto hard concrete. I quickly twisted onto my back and looked back into the room I’d come from. Led by an indented face, the flood of mannequins spilled over the counter and into the small pharmacy. With no hesitation, I pressed my foot against the slowly shutting emergency door, forcing it to shut faster as a single phrase screeched angrily from the other side, “Don’t leave, flesh! Don’t lea-” The scream abruptly cut off as the door slammed shut.\n\nI sat there for a moment, trying to understand what had just happened. Vacantly, I studied my surroundings to realize I was outside, sitting on a sidewalk. It was night now, and the spot where I sat was illuminated by a white, buzzing street light. After realizing this, I simply stood and ran from the building as fast as my aching legs would take me. \n\nI don’t think the true nature of what happened really hit me until I got back home. Ever since, I’ve started getting my groceries delivered, and I avoid retail stores like the plague. Mannequins have always creeped me out a little, but now I find myself distrusting even the most mundane looking ones. As terrifying as they are, however, the thing that disturbs me the most about my experience is how it happened in the first place. One minute I was checking out at the register and the next it was like I was in another world entirely. It doesn’t make any sense. \n\nIn my journey to find answers, I started sitting in the store’s parking lot, trying to keep watch on certain individuals that come in the store to see if they leave after some time. Thinking the bizarre events couldn’t have just happened to me, I thought I might eventually see someone else go into the store and maybe not return. It became an obsession of mine for months, but even sitting there on the opposite end of the parking lot and watching people go in, I always saw them come back out again within an hour or two, until yesterday, that is. \n\nI was sitting in my usual spot, keeping an eye on as many customers as my brain could register at once. Then, someone got my attention. Maybe it was because he kind of looked like me, wearing similar clothes and even with the same hair color and similar style. Or maybe it was because his mannerisms appeared similar to mine. I don’t really know why he drew my attention. But I watched him walk into the store before noon. I waited there for him to come out for hours, but by the time the sun started setting, I began to get worried. I supposed that he could have been an employee, but he wasn’t wearing the uniform of the store so I kind of doubt it. Either way, I waited until the store closed, an hour after that, even, and he never came out of the store.\n\nI’m convinced now that whatever happened to me, happened to him. Sadly, I don’t think he made it out. The whole situation has me racked with horrible guilt. Maybe if I’d said something, or tried to stop him somehow, I could’ve saved him. But when I think about it, what could I have done? He probably would have believed me crazy and just ignored my warnings anyway. \n\nI guess I’ll never really know. But what I believe to be his fate is the reason I decided to share this experience in the first place. It’s to warn all of you. I understand how insane it might all sound and I get that even if you believe me, you still need to get groceries, right? Well, take my advice and play it safe. Order your damn groceries from now on. Don’t go to large retail stores unless it's to pick up your items in the parking lot. And most importantly, stay the hell away from any mannequins.",

        "text": "✨Every house has its secrets✨\n\nOn Halloween  night, Christian and his four friends Logan, Kyle, Wesley and Stuart were at a party celebrating them all making it into college. They were all playing beer pong and listening to music having the time of their lives. As time went on the party got louder and louder which lead to the neighbours complaining. \n\nAt 03:30am Christian noticed flashing red and blue lights outside the house. His body started trembling as he was under age drinking but most importantly him and all his friends snuck out to go to this party. Christian screams “COPS!” and everyone dispersed into the back garden and jumped over the fence. The house they were at was just at the entrance of a forest, so Christian and the rest of his friends jumped over the fence and ran into the forest with no clue where they were going. After they got deep into the forest, one of Christians friends fell over and they all stop to catch their breath. \n\nChristian not wanting to stop starts overthinking about what his parents will say if they find out he snuck out, but as he traces back and forth he notices something carved out in a tree which said “ theres darkness deep inside all of us.” As he was reading this he heard a woman scream in the background, this scares him and makes him jump. His friends notice this and ask him what is wrong and what he is doing, but Christian turned to them looking like he saw a ghost. \n\nAs he caught his breath he asks them if they all heard that scream, they all gave a wired expression and said that none of them heard anything, Christian starts thinking that it was just his mind playing tricks on him, and tells them all to come and look at the carving in the tree. Logan was the first to get up but his face got even more confused, Kyle, Wesley, and stuart got up and looked but there was nothing carved into the tree. They all looked at Christian and Stuart asked if he took anything while at that party, Christian got annoyed and said that he didnt and there was definetely something carved into the tree, after 5 minutes of them all arguing a random thunderstorm appeared out of no where, all 5 of them start to run off heading deeper into the forest. \n\nThey cut through all the trees and bushes and enter a opening where they are now standing in front of a old broken down abandoned building. The building was made out of wood and most of it was covered in ash, and it had holes scaling from gun shots to huge chunks out of the wood. \n\nThey all looked at eachother as to say “should we go in.” As lightning struck again, They took off running towards the front door, Wesley got close to the door and tried to open it but it wouldnt open, Stuart being impatient got annoyed about the rain and said “dude… the wood’s burned, its damp, and its god knows how old, the slightest touch could put a hole through it.” He then told Wesley to move and puched the door near the handle, and to everyone’s suprise he punched a hole right through it, he then looked at Wesley and said “told you.” \n\nAs he unlocked the door, he slowly pushed it open, the door annoyingly creaked open which made everyone cover their hands over their ears. Stuart was the first to walk in, and everyone else followed slowly behind. The interior of the house was worse then the exterior, there was ash all over the floor, huge cobwebs in near enough in every corner of each room. Large cockroaches crawling through all the cracks in the floors and the walls, almost all the furniture and decorations in the house were burned, and what creeped the 5 boys out the most… \n\nThere was blood slowly dripping from the floorboards in the ceiling creating a puddle of blood on the sofa, seeing this Logan Wesley and Kyle instantly changed their mind about staying in the house, they all said they don’t want to stay here but Stuart and Christian said they weren’t going back out in that rain. After 10 minutes of constant bickering, Kyle, Logan, and Wesley all took off running out the house, while Stuart and Christian stayed and explored. \n\nThey were confused staring at all these wierd carvings in the wall, they were all sketches of a woman dressed in white, Christian made a joke about how the woman burned the house down and both of them started laughing, they laughed until the next drop of blood landed but this time it sent a cold shiver down both of their spines. They were both confused as to where the blood was coming from but most importantly what it was coming from. They both began to scale up the creepy/crooked staircase and as they got to the top, they approached the door to the room that the blood was dripping down from. Christian slowly reached for the handle and slowly opened the door…\n\nThank you for reading my story, If you liked it and want to read more of what I have wrote then click the link below:\n\nhttps://medium.com/@theunclassified801/the-woman-in-white-2ebe9f54515d",

        "text": " 10/01/23\n\nHave you ever been so tired that you dare not sit still for too long for fear that you might fall asleep? You know the scenarios I’m talking about here, like when you are at work in a meeting and you are fighting your eyes not to betray you and leave you with a pissed off manager. Or the time you come home from a long day and the health of your relationship with your girl would be shattered if you made the catastrophic mistake of dozing off whilst she was talking to you in the living room. Well, I’m that tired. Honestly that even sounds well rested from where I am now. I’ve been struggling with my sleep for a little over four weeks. At first, I didn’t think much of it, everyone has issues with their sleep at points. Everyone I spoke to echoed as such. Turn off your phone screens and computer an hour before bed, the advice from Google looked suspiciously like it was implanted directly from my mother. I half expected the results to tell me I would get square eyes too if I kept watching computer screens all day. Nonetheless, I implemented the advice. I implemented plenty of other strategies too. I’ve put up black out curtains to prevent all natural light from entering my bedroom. I’ve bought little foam earplugs to silence any noises that might disturb me. None of this has made much of a difference. I went to the Doctors about it last week, and at first, they didn’t really take me seriously. They mostly brushed it off and it was only when I practically begged them for help that they referred me to an online therapy resource. Doctors can’t just give out pills anymore it seems. No, my problem would have to have gone on a lot longer before they would even consider it. I’m keeping up with their therapy app. Normally I would consider meditation stuff kinda useless, but I’ll try most anything right now.\n\nThe waitress passes me and asks if I want anything else to order. I’m sat writing this too you in a café. It is winter, and so it is dark outside despite it not being particularly late. Stuff’s more expensive here, but I feel bad using the space for multiple hours doing my work without having the courtesy of ordering something every once in a while. I ask her for a glass of Fanta. Normally I would enjoy a cup of tea, or a coke if I wanted a fizzy drink. But I stopped drinking those weeks ago. Too much caffeine. The café is small and independent. This suits me greatly, as it is both mostly empty and in the less walked street of town. There is a desk area that looks out of the wide glass window onto the street and periodically I look up at someone passing, taking a shortcut. The path doesn’t permit cars which adds to the peace. I thank the waitress for the drink and allow the bubble to scratch down my throat. In my mind the drink perks me up and gives me enough alertness to keep writing in a placebo sense. I suppose you want to know what my story actually is. The reason my sleep is so disturbed. The truth is, I’m not sure. But my investigations into my tiredness lead me to discover something terrifying. I watched the video over this morning, and I haven’t been back to apartment since. I’m so deprived I still wonder if it was just some kind of delusion. A sleepless hallucination meant to taunt me into further sleeplessness in its cruelty. \n\nI first started by recording my snoring using an app. It purported to be able to tell if you had certain sleep conditions by your recordings. After a few days of this I was cleared of any potential sleep apnoea, although at points my breathing was deep, ragged, and just weird. Not enough of an explanation since I was still sleeping well without waking from what it sounded like. I was at a loss at this point. The weird part of it all is that I was able to get to sleep with no issues. I fall asleep so easily I’m sure many people would even be jealous. Yet no matter how much time I allocate to sleeping I always wake up drowsy and unrefreshed. The quality of my sleep must be rock bottom.  Short of buying sleeping pills online, I was left with only one other option.\n\nYesterday evening I set up my webcam. I fixed it to the top of my computer monitor and aimed it towards my bed. My desk was on the other side of the room, meaning that I should have had a decent view of me sleeping. I plugged in a small nightlight next to my bed so there was just enough light to see me. I don’t know what I expected to see. Excessive tossing and turning, sleepwalking maybe. Just trying something else and ticking that off the list would do.\n\nA light misty drizzle begins outside the café now. I see a man lightly jogging down the path, trying to cover his head with his jacket. Heading in the direction of the bus stop. The same bus stop I got off of first thing this morning. I virtually sprinted out of my apartment getting to the stop well before the first bus. I’m glad it didn’t rain whilst I waited this morning. I look around me in the café and there are only a couple other people here this late. An old man sits drinking coffee dressed in a knitted jumper, still wearing his overcoat. A much younger woman sits across from him, laughing and smiling. Their relationship and tone seem to indicate that this must be his daughter. Granddaughter possibly. There is young guy behind the counter browsing his phone. He has some unfortunate teenage acne gracing his lower cheeks and wears glasses that seem to embrace the stereotypical nerdy look. My eyes catch the waitress and I forget its socially inappropriate to stare at people too long. She offers me a polite smile as if to ask \n\n“Are you okay?”\n\nShe is certainly used to ‘writers’ sitting in the café hours at a time on their laptops, but I’ve pushed this definition far. Having been in here since they opened, I try and avoid checking the time. It’s anxiously close to their closing hours. \n\nI woke this morning a little earlier than usual with anticipation to check the footage I had recorded from the previous night. I would say that I felt drowsy, and I did, but this was no more than I had experienced each day previous. I yawned, approached the webcam and paused it. The runtime was a little over seven hours. I didn’t watch it straight away. Instead, I went about my usual morning routine. Brushing my teeth, taking a shit, showering, styling my hair, and getting dressed. I remember each of these in key detail since every moment I’ve been sitting in this café I wished I skipped them all and rushed out in some joggers and a shirt. \n\nThe recording starts innocuously enough. Me getting into bed and trying to sleep. It seems to take me about twenty minutes to do so. I guess you could call it performance anxiety. I skip ahead to the thirty-minute mark, and there I am. Sleeping soundly on my back. The audio on the camera isn’t the best, its just a shitty webcam after all, but from what I can hear my breathing is pretty normal at this point. I press fast forward on the video. I see my chest rise and fall rapidly and my body move through the natural motions of sleep in that comical fast forward of movement. I skip ahead to the hour thirty mark. I’ve turned over once or twice now, and coughed at least once. Not exactly sleep diagnosis territory yet. Once I get to the two hour mark I pause the video again and begin making some decaf tea alongside a bowl of porridge. I have plugged the camera into my laptop at this point and have moved to watching the footage in the kitchen. The anticipation of the video has mostly faded. I get to three hours realising that I’m just sleeping normally. I half expected to see myself in a half-awake state, explaining my terrible sleep. \n\nThat’s when it all goes dark. \n\nThe entire screen is sent into a fuzzy blackness you get when the camera cannot pick up enough light. This began at the three-hours forty-eight-minute mark. I anxiously waited for the screen to come back on. At the three hours fifty-one-minute mark the darkness faded., allowing an image to manifest once again. I could no longer see the whole of the bed. Blocking my view was the back of something standing not far Infront of the camera. I could not tell who or what it was. It was tall and the nightlight was mostly blocked meaning the figure was obscured. But the humanoid shape was undeniable. And it was looking at me. Staring at me. It continued to stay there, unmoving for hours. Just watching me sleep. Chills run through me as I type this to you. When I say I ran out of that apartment, I mean I’m pretty sure it was the fastest I have ever moved in my life. I don’t know if there was anything in there, I hadn’t heard or seen anything and I had been in every room of the apartment. I had to unlock the door as I panicked my way out of it. Once I was at the bus stop, I started the video again. It continued to stay there unmoving. It was present for many hours, body slightly swaying and moving but rooted to the spot. I skimmed along until the screen went dark yet again at six-hours fifty-seven minutes. It came back five minutes later and there I was. Sleeping soundly. Alone. Shortly after I woke up and moved to the camera, oblivious the intruder that was there only part of an hour before.\n\nI’m looking at the time at the bottom of the laptop right now. The café closes soon and the waitress has given me a heads up. I’ve struggled not to burst into tears. I have some sort of explanation for why my sleep has been so terrible, but it just makes me never want to sleep again. Hopefully typing this out will allow me to gather my thoughts. I have decided that I will go to the police in person first thing tomorrow. For tonight my best friend has said that I can crash at his place. I can’t imagine I’ll get much sleep but things should be safe at his place. I’ll make sure to update everyone tomorrow with what the police say. I just hope they don’t send me to a doctor thinking I’ve gone mad from lack of sleep.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n11/01/23\n\nIt is so much worse than I could have imagined. I’m currently sat in a side room at the police station with my friend, with uneaten breakfast sat on the desk in front of me. We are both sat in shocked silence after watching the second video. So last night, I decided to set up my camera again just in case. But this time, I put it next to me on the bed so that it was facing away from me. If there was some dark entity watching me at night and I wasn’t crazy, I figure I could capture it. I believed that there could be nothing there in my friend’s house but it gave a little more piece of mind. It took me well into the early hours to fall asleep. I was so scared to do so, even at my friend’s house. But in the end the tiredness took me forcibly. Watching the footage was a similar story to the night before. All was normal as expected. Until the darkness came. The minutes passed and then the light reanimated the picture. I felt as though I was going to choke on nothing as I registered a figure standing looking at the camera. It wasn’t a dark entity as I had been thinking.\n\nIt was me.\n\nI was standing at the edge of the bed looking towards the camera. I had no memory of this. It must be some kind of sleepwalk. The worst of it was my face. It was contorted into an innate terror, the muscles of my face seemingly twisting as they had never before. As I type, I’m sure my face currently has a similar expression. Police are investigating both mine and my friend’s home. The video continued until the darkness came, and then I was back in bed.\n\nThe camera was close enough to pick up sound this time.\n\nWhile I was stood petrified in an non-lucid state, the camera picked up sound from the space in my bed next to where I slept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDEEP, RAGGED, INHUMAN BREATHING.",

        "text": " \n\nI am a dog groomer, working on the road in a mobile grooming van. The vans are self-contained grooming salons, including a tub, a table, shampoo cubbies, a vacuum hose built into the wall, a 50-gallon water tank and a big generator in the back to run it all so clients don't have to worry about us tripping breakers by trying to plug the van into their house. The last time one of the generators died I tried to plug into someone's garage, and the second I turned on the dryer their whole house went dark, as did the van, and the dog had to go home sopping wet and unfinished.\n\nThe company that I work for is very small, just three vans and three employees, we all commute to our boss's house where the vans are parked in their driveway, the shed in the back yard serving as our “supply shed” where all of the extra shampoos, cleaners, RV antifreeze and various tools and extra parts for the interior of the salons, are kept. Our boss's house is set back into the woods, the road they live on is quiet and untraveled, the only noises once the sun goes down are the trees rustling in the wind, the neighbor's cat prowling the bushes, and the seasonal bugs and animals of the Pennsylvanian forest.\n\nAs the company's longest employee, I am sometimes tasked with training new hires to use the van, get them used to the daily ordeal of existing in a vehicle, getting them acquainted with the vans show them what all of the buttons, levers and switches do, run them through cleaning and prepping for the next day, stocking, filling the water tank, and filling the propane tank for the heater for when it's cold outside.\n\nDuring one of these ride-along days, I was showing the new hire how to work the vents and how to tell which direction the fans were pointing when I felt the van shift a bit. I didn't think too much of it, sometimes we had to parallel park on residential streets and a delivery van going a little too fast can sometimes cause the van to shift with the force of the wind.\n\nThe new girl braced herself a little, “is that normal?” Her eyes were wide, like she had forgotten that the room we were standing in was being held 7 inches off the ground by flexible suspension and rubber wheels.\n\n“Yeah, you'll get used to it, every road is different, and the different towns around here have different amounts of traffic, so you'll figure out the best spots to park as you go along.”\n\nShe nodded, still looking a little like she was about to lose her balance, but she pushed on, leaning against the wall and changing the subject to ask more questions about what certain buttons did on the wall behind me, and how to check the water level throughout the day. She asked questions like, “have you ever run out of water before?” I had, and I explained that water conservation and a certain routine for bathing the dogs was important to making sure you had enough water to last the day.\n\nA couple of houses later and I had her drying a dog in the back while I sat in the driver's seat and made a phone call, the back of the van was separated from the cab with a wall, and between the driver and passenger seats was a door that went into the salon area. The door was essentially just a frame with a large plexiglass window, and I could watch her through the door to make sure everything was running smoothly back there while I returned a missed call I received from my grandmother.\n\nUsually, she would leave me a voicemail, and it was generally something simple, asking if I needed to use the washer and dryer any time soon, or if I wanted to come over for dinner, but today was just a missed call and a text that just read “Call me back.” It was very unlike her to not tell me what it was she was calling for, my grandmother is a very straightforward woman, making her opinions and her needs immediately known, and not beating around the bush. For her to be as vague as she was, something must have been wrong.\n\nI dialed her number, and she picked up right after the first ring. “Hey, are you okay?”\n\n“Yeah, I'm fine, why wouldn't I be?” I was confused, her tone made her sound panicky and nervous. “I don't know, but something was telling me I needed to call you and tell you to be careful tonight.” She let out a sigh, “I don't know what you need to be careful of, but just... be careful.”\n\nI assured her that, while I was in the van, I was always careful, I was, after all, cruising around in a 5 ton, 10-foot-tall vehicle, and that wasn't exactly the nicest thing to drive on the narrow, windy, pothole filled roads of rural Pennsylvania. Too many times I have had to purposefully run red lights because the yellow light only stayed yellow for a split second and I didn't have the stopping power to make it, or I had missed a road because the curve was too tight and I was sure that if I tried to take the turn, I would surely end up toppling over.\n\nThis didn't mean that I didn't believe her that some force had pushed her to call me, she was an intuitive person, taking lessons and warnings from thin air with seemingly no rhyme or reason, but she had never steered me wrong. If my grandmother told me to be careful, then I better be goddamn careful.\n\nHer intuition had predicted so many things in the past, she always said the universe gave her gut punches. Anyone that knew her knew that if she had a prediction for you, it would most likely come true.\n\nWhen I was in high school, I worked at a pizzeria about a mile's walk up the road, my shift was from 4 to 9 and my boyfriend at the time would usually come pick me up so I didn't have to walk a mile home through the woods in the dark. One afternoon, I was getting ready to leave for work when my grandmother knocked on my bedroom door.\n\n“Hey, can I talk to you?” I told her to come in and she opened the door cautiously, “So, don't walk home from work tonight, okay? I don't want you out in the woods tonight.” This wasn't an unusual request, though it usually had to do with weather or bear sightings in the area, but it was a clear spring day and there was no rain on the horizon. “I don't know why, but I want your boyfriend to bring you home, I'm afraid that if you're out there tonight, you're going to get hurt.”\n\nI agreed, though I had walked home every night for the past few weeks since the weather had been so nice and nothing bad had happened yet, and headed into work.\n\nAt the end of my shift, my boyfriend came and picked me up, we had gotten a calzone and some fries to share for when we got home, and we started the short drive down the dirt, tree lined road back to my grandmother's house. There is one spot on the road that was always my favorite spot to stop when I would walk home, and I would smoke a cigarette while sitting on the guard rail with my headphones on. In this spot, the road towered about 20 feet above a small creek that, on a clear night, sparkled with the reflection of the moon, a guardrail was the only thing separating you from the drop off the side of the road, and on the other side of the road was a cliff face, standing about 10 feet over the road, the moss-covered rock faces were always wet, and they glistened green in the darkness.\n\nOn a normal night I would sit in this spot for a good 30 minutes sometimes, depending on how into an album I was, but on this night, as the headlights of my boyfriend's Ford Escort Wagon shown around the corner and illuminated my sitting spot on the side of the road, what greeted us there was not the peaceful overlook I would normally revel in.\n\nInstead, what greeted us was a crushed and jagged SUV, on its side, the dirt road glistening with broken glass and a puddle of oil mixing with transmission fluid draining from the cragged edged of the smashed-up hood. The car's rear fender was crumpled and folded over the guardrail, which was also twisted and warped, and instead of the moon reflecting off of the creek, this time, it was reflecting off of the driver's side window, which was aimed at the sky.\n\nA faint crying was coming from the inside, and we jumped out of the car, spotting a woman sitting, clutching her 3-year-old son in her arms, sitting on what was left of the passenger side door, the woman was crying, but the boy was kissing her face assuring her that “it's gonna be okay mommy.”\n\nWe ended up having to break the left back window with a rock to help lift the woman and her son out of the car and safely get their feet back on the ground. Neither of them were hurt, just a bruised ego, and a totaled car. She had swerved to miss hitting a deer and lost control of the car, flipping it onto its side and it slid into the guardrail.\n\nOdds are, had I walked home from work that night, I would have been sitting in that exact spot where the guardrail, now contorted and sagging, had stopped that car from going over the side of the road. I would have been sitting, blissfully unaware of the danger coming up behind me, enveloped in my headphones, smoking a cigarette. Odds are, had I walked home from work that night, I would have died.\n\nNow, here my grandmother was, nearly 10 years later, telling me again, to be careful, a warning I learned a long time ago to head without question.\n\nI had to take the new girl back to the boss's house early that day so she could go get her son from school, and I had one more dog after that that I would take care of by myself. It was late November, and I worked 10-hour days, so it was usually dark by my last dog at this time of year, especially this client, their house was set way back in the woods, off of a long dirt road. I'm convinced that, even if it were the middle of the summer, it would look dark back there, the thick canopy of trees blocked out any glimpse of the sky.\n\nI finished up with Tuffy the terrier, he usually took me about an hour, and packed up the van to head back for the night. As I was reversing down the driveway towards the road, I kept my eyes on the side mirrors, making sure I didn't scrape any trees or the stone wall that line the right side of the driveway. I glanced up at the backup camera screen for a quick second and slammed the breaks.\n\nI only saw it for a second, but it was clear as day, a face in the camera. It looked like someone wearing an ill-fitting Halloween mask where the face holes didn't quite fit correctly.\n\nOne eye socket was pulled slightly up on the outer corner, while the other was scrunched in towards the nose and drooped down into the cheek and the eyes were set deep, deep into the folds of skin. The nose was straight until the very tip, which was upturned and jutted out to the side, the mouth hanging loosely, the lower lip falling below a set of crooked, plaque encrusted teeth. Small tufts of black hair stuck out in patches on the scalp, the bald patches were white and scaly.\n\nI slammed the car into park, clutching my chest. Who was that? And why were they standing behind a large truck going in reverse?\n\nThat's when it hit me. The backup camera's location. It was on the top of the roof of the van, at least 9 and a half feet off the ground. Whoever that was was close enough to the camera to where I could only see their face, which means they were either nine and a half feet tall, or they were climbing up the back of the van. I didn't like either one of those options, but weighing the two of them, I suppose I would take tall over using the van as a jungle gym.\n\nThe van swayed, the same way it had earlier when the new girl was with me. But I was parked, in the woods, in a driveway, there were no trucks to drive by and push the van around. I thought back to where I was parked earlier in the day and realized, the odds of a truck driving by with enough speed to move the van on that very narrow one-way street were very, very unlikely.\n\nI quickly hit the lock button on the door, locking all of the doors, and put the van back in reverse. I just wanted to get out of the woods, it was too dark, and the van had a headlight out, and I could barely see through the thickening November fog. I stared at the backup camera as I made my way out of the driveway and onto the road, at first, I didn't see anything out of the ordinary, until I looked closer. From the angle of the camera, I could see most of the back doors, and one of the hinges on the top of one of the doors didn't match the others, it had too many ridges. And then it moved, unfurling into fingers that were wrapped around the side of the door and the pulled up onto the roof and out of sight.\n\nThe van swayed again, but this time it was more like a jolt, and I threw the van into drive and took off as quickly as I felt comfortable on this road with no streetlights. There was a thudding on the roof, a rhythmic *'boom boom boom scrape scrape scrape'* coming from the top of the plastic air conditioning vents. Thats all that was keeping it out of the van, a thin black plastic hood, a plastic fan and a screen. That was all there was between it being outside the van... and it being inside the van with me.\n\nI skidded around the last lightless corner, feeling the uneven weight on the top of the van shift with the turn, and made it to an intersection, the light was green, and I sped through it, finding the first brightly lit parking lot. I tore the key out of the ignition, jumped out of the van and ran for my life.\n\nI stopped when I reached the road, there were tons of cars on the road, a few drivers even staring at me like I was crazy, I was, after all, running like hell away from a work van with no jacket on in November. I turned back towards the van. There was nothing on the roof. I walked a very wide circle around the van, looking from all sides to see if there was anything on, or in, the van. There was nothing, and no one.\n\nI put my keys between my fingers and slowly walked back towards it, opening the back doors first and peering around the storage area, then the front doors, checking under the dashboard and seats, and then the sliding door to the salon, even checking in the tub and inside the tiny cubbyholes where we store the towels, knowing damn well no one would fit in the foot and a half tall, little cabinet.\n\nI stood outside the van, breathing, watching my breath steam in the cold night air, and grabbed my jacket from the front, lighting a cigarette. I didn't usually smoke at work, but dammit I needed this.\n\nAfter it took what felt like an eternity for my heart to stop racing, I got back in the van and headed back towards my boss's house. I was only about 5 minutes up the road at this point, and I just wanted to be back so I could get in my own car and go home.\n\nThe closer I got to my boss's house, the darker the roads got as streetlights became more and more sparse, and soon, my high beams were the only thing lighting the scenery. I passed a corn field, and out the passenger side window, I saw it.\n\nIt was the height of a child, probably no more than 5 feet tall, its body was lumpy and misshapen, again, like it was wearing skin that just didn't fit. I wasn't wearing clothes, but it had no defining genitalia or and hair other than the black tufts on its head. It started at me out of its eye holes, and lifted one arm, the skin hanging in lumpy sacks off of it and pointed one spindly finger at me. It took a step back into the corn field, and then it was gone.\n\nWhen I pulled into my boss's driveway, I didn't even take the time to fill the water tank, I ran the antifreeze through the lines to winterize as quickly as possible and then I threw myself into my Prius and took off as quickly as I could, texting my boss that I wasn't feeling well, and I would finish prep when I got back in the morning.\n\nThe next morning, when I pulled into the driveway, my boss was standing outside, looking up the side of my van at the air conditioner vent.\n\n“Hey, I just noticed the vent is cracked a bit on top.”\n\nI started at him, speechless, and then glanced at the vent, there were marks on the top and sides of the vent, it looked like some large creature had been gnawing on it.\n\n“It's probably from low tree branches, just be careful if you see any and take it slow when you do, I'll buy a replacement for the front, but try not to crack the back one too.”\n\nI nodded, apologizing, of course it was low hanging tree branches. What else could it have been?",

        "text": "It was supposed to be a relaxing getaway, a chance for my friends and I to escape the city and enjoy some time together in the great outdoors. We found the perfect cabin on a secluded piece of property in the middle of the woods, and we couldn't wait to spend a weekend there.\n\nThe cabin was an old, dilapidated structure, but it had a certain charm to it. It was nestled deep in the woods, far away from civilization and surrounded by tall trees that seemed to tower over us. It was the perfect place to get away from it all and just enjoy the peace and quiet of nature.\n\nBut as soon as we arrived, strange things started happening. We heard strange noises in the night, and saw shadows moving on the walls when there was no one there. We thought it was just our imaginations playing tricks on us, but as the days went on, the occurrences became more and more frequent and intense.\n\nAt first, we shrugged it off as just being in an old, unfamiliar cabin. But soon, it became clear that something was very wrong. The shadows seemed to move with a will of their own, and we started to feel like we were being watched. We began to lock ourselves in our rooms at night, too scared to even move.\n\nIt was on the third night when things took a turn for the worse. I was alone in the cabin and I heard a knock on the door. I opened it to find no one there, but I saw fresh footprints in the snow leading away from the cabin. I immediately woke up my friends, but they found nothing when they looked outside. It was as if someone was playing a cruel joke on us.\n\nThe next day, we found strange symbols carved into the trees surrounding the cabin. It was as if someone had been trying to send us a message, but we had no idea what it meant. We were terrified, and we knew that we had to leave.\n\nBut as we were packing up our things, we discovered that our car wouldn't start. We were stranded, with no way to call for help. We searched the cabin and found a hidden room in the basement. Inside, we found a strange ritualistic altar covered in blood and human remains. We realized then that the cabin was built on an ancient burial ground and that we had disturbed the spirits of the dead.\n\nWe were trapped, with no way to escape, and the spirits were closing in. We knew that our only chance was to perform a ritual to appease the spirits and put them to rest. But as we were about to perform the ritual, we heard a knock on the door, and it was a hooded figure that appeared. He explained to us that he was the one who was living on the cabin before us and had gone missing. He had to leave the cabin because he got sick and was unable to continue the ritual, that he has been performing to keep the spirits of the dead away. Since he was not able to continue the ritual, the spirits were able to break free and were now after us. He suggested that we should leave the cabin as fast as we could.\n\nBut we were not able to leave the cabin yet. We have to wait until the next day as it was already too dark to go out and the spirits were roaming around. We had no other choice but to spend the night in the cabin.\n\nWe spent the night in the cabin, huddled together in the living room, too afraid to even move. We didn't sleep at all, we just waited for the dawn to come, hoping that the spirits would leave us alone long enough for us to make our escape. But as the night went on, the occurrences became even more terrifying. We heard scratching on the walls, and whispering voices in our ears. We were convinced that the spirits were trying to claim us for themselves.\n\nAs morning finally came, we grabbed our things and prepared to leave. The hooded figure had warned us that we would have to perform a ritual to pass through the spirits safely. So, we gathered all the materials we could find and performed the ritual, hoping it would be enough to protect us.\n\nWe opened the door and stepped out into the cold morning air. At first, everything seemed normal. But as we began to make our way down the path leading away from the cabin, we started to feel a sense of dread creeping over us. The spirits were all around us, watching and waiting.\n\nWe were in a state of complete panic as we stumbled through the woods, trying to find our way to safety. We could hear the spirits all around us, closing in, and we knew that they were angry. They were furious that we had disturbed their resting place and were determined to make us pay.\n\nWe were running as fast as we could, but we knew it wouldn't be enough. The spirits were gaining on us, and we could feel their cold breath on our necks. We were so close to the main road, but it felt like it was miles away.\n\nJust as we were about to give up hope, we saw a car in the distance. We ran towards it, waving our arms and yelling for help. The car slowed down and stopped, and we got into the back seat, tears streaming down our faces.\n\nThe driver looked back at us and asked, \"Are you okay? What happened?\" We told him about the cabin in the woods and the spirits that were chasing us. He listened with a look of concern on his face, and when we finished, he started the car and got us out of there.\n\nWe never spoke of that cabin again. But the memory of it still haunts us to this day. We all have had nightmares of the cabin and the spirits, and we can't shake the feeling that they're still out there, waiting for us to return.",

        "text": " \n\nI wish I had never ventured into that part of the woods. The leaves were a deep, dark green, with an almost spectral quality to them, as if they were masking some eldritch secret. I felt an inexplicable pull towards it, one which I could not deny.\n\nAgainst my better judgement, I chose to take a step forward into the unknown, captivated by my own longing for adventure. Little did I know then that this decision would lead me down a path of peril and anguish. The first time I passed by, I saw a delicate white rabbit hopping around, its ears flapping softly. There was something bewitching about it, something strangely alluring. I felt as if I had no control of my actions; I felt an immediate affinity with the creature, and my heart burned with a desire to nurture it. I scooped it up and took it home with me.\n\nThe next day, I revisited the same spot and stumbled upon dozens of other bunnies of many colours and sizes. It was as if they had been expecting me, as if they had been waiting for me. Fascination overtook me, and I brought a few of them back home with me. My awe soon developed into a psychological reflection of my life. I looked around me and asked myself if my deeds were as pure and innocent as these creatures, and if I was living life with the same grace and tenderness. I felt my heart racing, and my mind was abuzz with a myriad of interior musings.\n\nAt first, I was content simply looking after them and taking them on voyages with me. I felt as if I had found some new companions, and we had some incredibly bewitching experiences together. Yet, soon I noticed that the rabbits were behaving oddly. They were timid and cautious, and they seemed to have a supernatural understanding of their surroundings. No matter where we ventured, they seemed to know the place like the back of their claws. It became obvious that the rabbits were part of a much bigger system of creatures and that I had opened a portal to a strange and perilous new world.\n\nI was afraid, but I could not abandon the rabbits. As my only bond to this land, I felt the need to protect them. So, I stayed and uncovered the secrets of this world, learning about its inhabitants and their peculiar customs. I was flabbergasted by the creatures I encountered, but I also came to realise how dangerous this place was. There were obscure and intimidating forces at play, and I worried that if I stayed any longer, I would be met with a dire fate. I tried to discover a way back home, but I had no success. I was held captive in this realm, and I felt an ever-growing sense of dread that weighed down on my soul. As my hope was fading, I knew I had to find a way back or I would be stuck in this strange world forever.\n\nThe search for my way back was filled with horrifying events. I encountered creatures that wished to do me harm, and I only just escaped with my life. But I was determined to return home and so I ventured through many different realms and witnessed things that no human should ever lay eyes on. I faced my fears and persevered, and eventually, after months of searching, I found a portal back to the real world. I was ecstatic and filled with a sense of relief, but I also had a heavy spirit. I felt guilt for leaving the rabbits behind in that alien world, but I knew I had to save myself. I had no other choice but to leave them. Looking back on all my experiences, I have come to understand that sometimes we need to take a leap of faith and explore what is beyond our normal realm of understanding, no matter how perilous the journey may be.\n\nWe need to accept that life is filled with both beauty and terror and that by embracing the unknown, we open up to the possibility of discovering true greatness. And although I may never know what became of those rabbits that I left behind, I know that I will always carry a part of them with me, as a reminder that amidst the dark and hideous moments of life, there will always be light and hope.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nxxx",

        "text": "so i believe that a man attempted to follow me home after a late work shift. my job knows that i walk so they try to not schedule me late hours because of that. however, i told them that my cut off time is 11 pm for my shifts. \n\nyesterday i was scheduled to work until 11 and ended staying about 20 minutes later than expected to help close. after clocking out i took my normal route home. i know i should switch it up and i try to but it was late and this was the fastest way home. to get back to my house i cut through my college campus as a safety precaution. i know our campus gym stays open late and the police department is open 24/7. \n\ncampus was dead as students weren’t returning back to campus for the spring until tomorrow. as I was walking i felt someone behind me. it was a strange feeling because i hadn’t noticed anyone around me as i was walking and i make sure to always check my surroundings. when i turned back and looked, there was a man uncomfortably close behind me with a smug look on his face. i was immediately spooked but i tried to convince myself i was paranoid.\n\nI went to cross the street (i jay walked) and i noticed the man didn’t cross until i did. this is when i got really scared but still tried to convince myself i was overthinking it. i put some distance between us and he began walking on the sidewalk parallel to me. i noticed he was walking as if he was making a left to head towards the dorms and i felt relief. as i continued walking a random boy on scooter came up to me and asked for number and was trying to start conversation (i saw him in our gym parking lot with his friend on the scooter).  Our conversation was short and he rode away. \n\ni felt someone behind me again and i turned back and it was the man and he was closer to me this time. after seeing him again i felt myself almost have a panic attack. i tried to stay calm but at this point i knew he was attempting to follow me because to get behind again he would’ve had to turn around and pick up his pace. at this point i pulled out my phone and texted my friends and said i was scared. i decided to change my route up and he continued to cross the street when i did and never stopped following me until he saw i was on the phone.  \n\nthe biggest thing that creeped me out was i noticed a car parked in a parking lot that i normally cross to get the crosswalk that’s close to my home. i kept looking behind me and notice the the car had its headlights on. the car never moved from that spot no matter how many times i looked back. I decided that once i reached safety i would call the cops and i ended filing a report with our local pr and campus pd.\n\ni am still spooked and the more i think about it the scarier it gets. the normal route i go leads me to walking through a narrow alley way between dorms it’s well lit but very cramp. i still get chills thinking about what would’ve happened if i would’ve kept straight.",

        "text": "Hey, I want to preface this by saying I’m not usually paranoid. Just a little anxious sometimes. I feel so over the place right now and I think something is driving my mom’s car. \n\nLast night my mom and I stayed up a bit too late watching The Walking Dead. We’ve watched about 6 seasons in 2 weeks, rookie numbers, I know. Mom usually works about 70 hours a week with 2 jobs, since her ex-husband left, good riddance. I moved back in with my toddler, figuring we can help each other out while I look for a new job. She also has her hands full with my 3 middle-school-aged brothers. \n\nSo, we stayed up late. Before we knew it was 11 and we realized my brother had quietly put themselves to bed. They’re a rowdy bunch but I figured they just wanted more sleep after all their extracurriculars. I just hoped they brushed their teeth. It was a pretty normal night. I said goodnight to mom, checked on my daughter, and got myself ready for bed. \n\nWell, when I finally fell asleep, I slept fitfully. I kept having nightmares, like weird gory shapes, and a feeling of dread. I figured I’d watched too much tv.\n\nThen this morning, the whole house woke up an hour late. 5 alarms were somehow snoozed or ignored. Mom called for them and the 3 trudged downstairs looking exhausted. We hurried through the morning routine and she offered to drop me off on her way to work, which today is in a rural town about an hour away. My car broke a couple of days ago, so I gladly accepted. Taking public transit with a toddler can be challenging.\n\nBut like I said, today feels off. My daughter is normally excited to see everyone in the morning, but today she wrapped herself in a blanket and hid in the couch as much as possible. Mom smiled tightly at my difficulties trying to coax her into getting her boots on but I brushed it off. I looked around to see how everyone else was shaping up. My youngest brother was sitting at the table just glaring into the distance, and one of the twins was standing in front of the closed fridge. \n\nI’m sure everyone is just tired.\n\nWe got to my daughter's school, I asked mom to call when she got to work and I went to catch the nearest bus. \n\nIt had just pulled up as I started my awkward jog across the street, I fumbled for the pass in my pocket but couldn't feel it. The driver looked at me and said, ‘don’t worry I believe you’ and started whistling some familiar tune I couldn’t quite place. I found an open seat and stared out the window, watching the morning fog and gray roll over the river. It’s kind of nice being the passenger sometimes. \n\nAt the transfer station, the fog had cleared a bit and I decided to walk the rest of the way, I’ve been sitting too much lately. As I hopped off the driver called out to me, ‘be careful’ but like, he was looking through me. Dude was cheerful, whistling the whole way, but that look. It unnerved me, his whole demeanor changed.  I pulled my coat tighter and said ‘thank you’. \n\nI hurried past the bank but stopped when I saw black feathers. There were two raven corpses on the sidewalk and they were, well, strange. The bones in the chest cavity were picked clean, the heads bent sharply to the side, and the wings spread and seemingly untouched, but their legs were in the road. Can someone tell me, is there like a rabid squirrel that would do that? \n\nWhen I got to about a block away, I saw my mom’s car. It’s a pretty typical one, but I know it’s hers because of the faded bumper stickers. I didn’t get a good look at her because the windows are tinted. Maybe she went back for her phone charger? But she was running late. I had to have been imagining it. When I got to the end of my street, my phone rang, mom calling. \n\nI answered and asked if she had grabbed her charger. She was confused for a minute, she’s at her visit now she just wanted to let me know she got there safe. She thought I was already home because our ring camera had just picked up someone on our porch. The mail hasn’t come yet.\n\nI told her I was coming up to the house now. \n\n\\---\n\nI got inside and our two big ass dogs nearly jumped me. I mean, they get excited and bark, but this, they were trying to be menacing. Even after they heard my voice, they didn’t want me to move from the door. They pushed it closed almost faster than I could get inside. \n\nI was about to scold them for tearing open a bag of chips and barking but when I actually looked at them, they were scared and still staring at the damn door. I double checked the deadbolt and the house alarm and called them to the back door. They ran at me and nearly knocking me over trying to sit on my feet. I tried to make them go potty outside they wouldn’t budge. I swear mastiff dogs can be the biggest babies. I gave up and we’re hanging out in my room. They keep pacing and whining and I just heard the alarm for the front porch. \n\nGuys, my mom is here. Something doesn’t feel right.",

        "text": "My sister, Mia, died in a tragic drunk driving accident when she was eighteen. Bad luck. At least, that’s what people said. Except that she’d been letting drunk boys drive her home from the city every weekend since she started high school. Spin the roulette wheel one two many times, and it’s bound to come up double-zero.\n\nShe died in 1999. I was a sophomore and on a totally different path. Instead of shaking off my middle school goth phase like most of my friends, I’d doubled down. I’d read my way through all of the basic Wicca books and moved on to darker stuff you had to find at antique bookstores. \n\nAt Mia’s funeral, I brought a pair of antique scissors with me, and when I got to the coffin, I leaned over as if to kiss her forehead. As I did, I surreptitiously cut a lock of hair, quickly shoving it into my pocket.\n\nThe spell itself was pretty basic once I had the hair. At midnight on the one-month anniversary of her death, I tied the hair as a braided ring around my left pinky and knelt at Mia’s gravestone, kissing it thirteen times. Between each kiss, I repeated the incantation, “In the name of the mother, the daughter, the sister, I invite you in. In the name of the mother, the daughter, the sister, I invite you in.”\n\nAs I repeated the words for the final time, the braided ring suddenly bound tight around my finger, cutting off the circulation. And then I heard Mia’s voice in my head. “Where am I?”\n\n“You’re a passenger,” I whispered. “You’re in me now, seeing everything I see. Feeling everything I feel.”\n\n“I can’t move,” she said. “Why can’t I move?”\n\nI could tell she was panicking. I tried to remember what the book had suggested about coaching the dead through their return to our world. \n\n“I am giving you control of the pinky finger,” I said, “the one bound with your hair. Ease the bindings there and take control… Now.”\n\nI felt the braid relax, and then the finger began to wiggle, completely out of my control.\n\n“It’s moving!” she shouted inside my head, thrilled. “Give me another one! Give me the hand!”\n\n“Not yet,” I said. “Be grateful for what you have.”\n\nBut Mia was not grateful. All night long, she kept me up, begging for more. Finally, I relented and gave her the entire left hand, even the left arm. I tried to sleep, but it was kind of hard with her raising her hand all night and letting it flop to the mattress. \n\nAs I got ready for school the next day, I made her give the arm back, and she reduced her control back to just the pinky. It was just too hard to get dressed otherwise. I went through my morning routine, putting on a black lace corset top and baggy jeans with holes at the knees. The whole time, Mia made gagging noises.\n\n“You do realize we’re the same size, right?” she complained. “Go raid my closet. Believe me, you have my permission. There are a couple of new dresses I never even got to wear.”\n\n“Remember that you’re a passenger,” I said, gently chiding her and trying to remember what my books had said. “As the recently dead, it may be difficult for you to come to terms with your new position. Please remember that I am your host.”\n\n“Some host,” she said.\n\nAt school, Mia zoned out, basically letting me get through my classes undisturbed. Every once in a while, she’d ask if it was time for lunch yet, but mostly she was quiet. \n\n“Everything okay?” I asked.\n\n“It’s just… weird here. Everything is the same, but I’m not here. They’re just all going through the same routine, like I never existed.”\n\n“It’s been a month,” I said. “People move on.”\n\nWe sat outside in the spring warmth, watching the skaters practice ollies in the parking lot. \n\n“Which is the one you like?” asked Mia, and I pointed out a tall, skinny guy named Dan that I’d been crushing on since freshman year. We had kind of a a cute, flirty friendship going on, but I’d never had the guts to make a move.\n\n“We should go talk to him,” she said.\n\n“Are you kidding? He’s busy.”\n\nBut she wouldn’t take no for an answer. I felt the pinky lifting up, basically taking the rest of the arm with it. Before I knew it, Mia had taken the arm over again and was waving to Dan, who skated across the parking lot toward us.\n\n“Sup?” he asked, and I totally froze. \n\n“Give me the mouth,” said Mia. “You’re making us look stupid.”\n\n“There’s no us. It’s just me,” I said in my head.\n\n“You all good?” asked Dan.\n\n“Do it,” said Mia. “You’re blowing this.”\n\nAnd so I gave her my lips, my tongue, my throat.\n\n“I saw you land that kickflip,” I heard myself say. “Any way you could teach me sometime?”\n\n“Definitely,” said Dan. “Just takes some practice!”\n\n“Hey, are you up to anything after school?” I asked.\n\n“Just hanging out with some friends. You want to kick it?”\n\n“I’m there,” I said.\n\nMy last period was study hall, and Mia convinced me we could skip out early and head home. \n\n“This is your big shot to get Dan to like you,” she said. “Let’s make it count.”\n\nWe headed into her room and started leafing through her outfits. Finally, she found a floral print sundress and grabbed it from its hanger.\n\n“No way in hell,” I said, but she just started taking my jeans off. When had I given her control of my whole left arm? I couldn’t remember. In fact, I realized she had taken both legs too. I was stuck in my right hand, only up to the wrist.\n\nI tried to fight her, wiggling my fingers as she discarded my clothes and put on her own, but it was no use. Soon enough, I was dressed just like her.\n\n“This isn’t funny,” I said. “You need to give me back my body. Now.”\n\nMia laughed.\n\n“What were you using it for anyway,” she asked, as she washed my makeup off in the sink. She wiped away my black mascara and pulled out her own, more subtle blue eyeshadow and lip gloss. “I was always the fun one, you know?”\n\n“I invited you in,” I said, fear suddenly filling my small section of my own body. I realized only a small section of me was trembling. Terrified. The other part–the Mia part–was thrilled and happy. “I wanted to give you a second shot at life. To be a passenger.”\n\n“I’ve never been a passenger,” she said. “I’m the driver. Always. And that’s how it’s going to be from now on. I’ve got a second shot, and I’m taking it. No way I’m going to sit on the sidelines and watch you live your boring ass existence. So just go do what you always do: sit on the sidelines and watch me live.”\n\nI wanted to scream, but I had no voice, no lips. She’d taken them all. I tried to will myself up the right arm and made it as far as the elbow. I reached up and smacked the lip gloss out of  her hand. It clattered into the sink.\n\n“Big mistake,” she said, and suddenly, I felt her will pushing at mine, harder than I’d even imagined. I left the elbow, even the hand. My whole self was pushed into the tiny space at the joint of the right pinky.\n\nAt Dan’s house, Mia didn’t miss a beat.\n\n“What’re we drinking?” she asked.\n\n“We were just gonna smoke a little bit and watch some Mitch Hedfield standup,” he said. \n\nShe gestured over at his parents’ liquor cabinet.\n\n“Can you make me a fuzzy navel?” she asked.\n\n“Did you change your outfit?”\n\nShe ignored him and walked over to the bottles, opening some vodka.\n\n“How about shots? You guys know how to do shots, right?”\n\nIf I could have cried, I would have. But all I could do was barely wiggle in place. I tried to push up through the finger, into the hand, but Mia’s will was just too strong. It was like trying to do pushups with my tongue. No matter how hard I tried, I knew that I would never be stronger than her.\n\nMia and the guys started drinking, and she curled up next to Dan on the couch, stroking his hair. I might have been thrilled, except it wasn’t *me* doing it. It was her. Soon, she was nibbling at his earlobe, asking if he wanted to show her his room.\n\n“No,” I said. “Don’t do this. This isn’t what I wanted.”\n\n“What you wanted was to pine on the sidelines and never make a move. Face it, you’ve been acting like the dead one your whole life. Well, get ready to start seeing what actual living looks like.”\n\nShe took him in the room and pushed him down on the bed, pulling up her dress. But when she started in on his belt, he gently grabbed her wrists and told her to stop.\n\n“Listen,” he said. “I’ve always thought you were a cool girl… but this isn’t you. I know you just lost your sister last month. I’m sure that kind of fucked you up emotionally. I don’t want to, you know, take advantage.”\n\n“Forget about my sister,” she said, reaching for his belt again.\n\nHe shook his head. “I think you should go.”\n\nMia stormed out of the bedroom, pulling on her dress and she marched down the hall. Then she grabbed the handle of vodka and blew out the front door, leaving it swinging open behind her.\n\nFor a while, we walked the city streets, drinking freely from the bottle. Once or twice, she nearly wandered into traffic, and I felt our heart skip. Despite what she said, I *wasn’t* living my life like a dead girl. I was just trying to live it slow. \n\nAnd I loved my nights staying up late, reading spells and watching the room rise of the distant mountains. I even loved the pain of pining for a boy I was too scared to talk to. I loved being alive.\n\nAnd now it was too late. She’d taken my body and was living life her way, fast and reckless. I’d never get it back. \n\nBy the time we got back home, the bottle was gone, and Mia could barely stand. She headed into the kitchen and microwaved some leftover pizza. \n\nThen, as we watched the numbers on the microwave something started to shift. Dead drunk, her grasp on my body started to slip. I pushed slightly at the wall of will she’d built around me, and found it porous and spongy. Carefully, so I didn’t alert her, I slipped out of my cage and up into the hand, the arm. \n\nOut of the corner of our eye, I spotted the meat cutting scissors in the knife block. If I could reach over and grab them, then I could snip the loop of hair on my left pinky and release the binding. Mia would be gone.\n\nEver so gently, I pushed my will into our right leg and took a small step toward the block. Then I ran my hand along the counter toward the scissors and grabbed them. This was my one and only chance. If I blew it now, she’d be on high alert, and I’d be back in the right pinky again, probably forever.\n\nIn one quick motion, I grabbed the scissors and hooked them under the braided hair, but when I tried to cut it, it didn’t snap. It was like trying to cut an iron band in half. Mia’s laughter filled my head.\n\n“You’ve got to be fucking kidding me, right?” she asked. “I saw that move coming a mile away. I’ve got like half my soul in that ring, sis, keeping it strong as a diamond. You’d have an easier time cutting the kitchen counter in half.”\n\nI felt her starting to push me back. But before she took the arm back, I made my move. I moved the blades of the scissors from the ring to the joint of my left finger and squeezed as hard as I could.\n\n“What the fuck?!” I heard her screaming, but by then it was too late for her. Her essence drained from me fast, like water down a bathtub drain, all flowing out into the severed finger.\n\nOf course, I told everyone it was an accident. I’d been cutting the pizza and slipped. Maybe people believed me, or maybe they chalked it up to the grief of losing a sister. I really didn’t care.\n\nAs for the finger, I kept it safely hidden. I knew the doctors would want to reattach it, and I couldn’t have that. I told them I must have lost it down the disposal when I was panicking over the accident.\n\nIt’s been more than two decades now, and I never did grow out of my goth phase. I run a little bookstore in the city, specializing in a very particular set of tomes. \n\nSometimes I help people get things they want. Very special things that require a little help from someone like me.\n\nOf course, many of the spells call for the use of a captured soul, one that must undergo some very unpleasant suffering to make the magic function. Most people in my line of work don’t have access to one of those.\n\nIn the end, I’m thankful to my sister for all that she taught me. And for all of the sacrifices she continues to make so that I can live life I always dreamed of.",

        "title": "Have you ever performed The Ghost Train Game?",
        "author": "Ok_Responsibility403",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/109cejb/have_you_ever_performed_the_ghost_train_game/",
        "text": "After learning about a few ritual games yesterday, and seeing multiple Reddits that post these games online, I thought I'd share one that I performed as a little kid. I did not see it on this Reddit already, so I decided that I should be the first one to share here. Like all the other games, PLAY AT YOUR OWN RISK. You will have everlasting memories about it and may potentially die. This is highly dangerous. It may be too much to handle. It will test your strength and it could take it from you even if you're just a little bit thanatophobic. You may become weak and the facade you put on every day to seem like you don't fear death will shatter. You may even become afraid and retreat. You may think about everything you've done in your life, and all the wonderful things you've achieved, and feel guilty, sad, and remorseful for choosing to do this. Just don't do it. For the sake of your life, please don't do this. \n\nThis ritual dates back to the late 19th century, according to a friend of mine who likes to research history and occult-related stuff. My friend (let's call her Maria) states that nobody really plays it anymore and that it has gone out of style. She introduced me to it at a slumber party and dared me to perform this. The objective here is to summon a ghost train, as you can tell by the title of the ritual game. You do so by whistling at night. They are beholden to no earthly schedule and are in charge of transporting souls to the afterlife. The train driver is none other than The Grim Reaper himself. You will know that you have summoned a ghost train if you hear something whistle back. You may also hear additional noises such as a scream that can only be described as that of a banshee, La Llorona, The Ankou, etc.; the sounds of someone being murdered; sounds that will fill you with fear and hopelessness; and indescribable things that do not fit in any sort of category. You may also feel a powerful, heavy, dark, but not exactly evil (unless you perceive The Grim Reaper to be evil) presence. You also may feel like you're not able to breathe for a few seconds as chills run down your spine, smell the sickly sweet scent of death and decomposition, or just feel extremely cold throughout your entire body. But you won't be able to see the train unless you're able to see the dead.\n\nYou can only perform this at a set of train tracks that are directly in front of a cemetery or graveyard. Note that it is illegal to access private railroad property anywhere other than a designated pedestrian or roadway crossing, not to mention dangerous. If you don't want to get caught doing this, also make sure that it is abandoned. I'd also recommend taking a lantern or flashlight with you to help you light your way, a vehicle to drive just in case you can't reach the tracks by walking, and warm clothes if it's slightly chilly outside. Got all that? Okay, let's begin.\n\n# Directions:\n\n1. **When it is dark, and when you believe that it's The Devil's Hour and feel that it is the perfect time, take your stuff with you and go to the set of train tracks.** If you drive there, park your vehicle someplace safe before proceeding.\n2. **Walk until you're on top of the train tracks.** Use your source of light so you don't accidentally trip and fall in the dark.\n3. **Walk a mile leisurely.** Do not get tired and do not run out of breath, just walk normally.\n4. **Now, purse your lips and begin to whistle.** Make a sound like a train whistle. Do not stop until you can hear if there is another whistle.\n5. **When you hear the whistle, step off the train tracks so you don't get hit.** I can only imagine that getting hit by the ghostly mass would feel like running into a brick wall. Plus, it increases your chances of death.\n6. **Listen until you can hear the train no more.** As stated previously, you may also hear additional sounds, and almost all of your senses will be used. Afterwards, there will be an eerie stillness.\n7. **Go back to your house.** If you brought your vehicle with you, drive back after turning off your lantern. If not, walk back and do not enter the house until you turn off your source of light. You may or may not still be affected by what you heard, it depends on your levels of thanatophobia (a person who does not fear death will not be affected by it, but a person who does will always be affected by it).\n8. **If you want to do the ritual again, remember that the ghost train will remember you.** It will also remember what scares you and what doesn't. And, one day, you'll be one of the passengers to your final destination.\n\nDO NOT LET ITS SIMPLICITY FOOL YOU. There are a lot of dangerous things that could happen. I also wouldn't suggest recording this because, from first-hand experience, your camera could malfunction and delete it the next day. I also wouldn't suggest making contact with any living creature that isn't you, digitally or in person, because they could die if you reach out to them during this, and maybe The Grim Reaper will decide to drive them to Hell (or Tartarus, or whatever dreadful afterlife that your friend believes in) if he feels irritated. You don't want him irritated. If you do anything to offend him, he will get irritated, so be polite and only whistle. Do not take any holy objects with you because some passengers of the train may be going to Heaven, other passengers may be going to Hell, and you shouldn't mess with what afterlife they're going to. Alright, well, with all of that being said, I wish you luck if you try it and try not to die!",

        "text": "I set up a damn security camera in my living room after coming home one night to find the rest of my toilet paper used up. I live alone.\n\nNow I know that sounds silly, absurd even. Had it been the one time I found something out of place in my two-bedroom house, I wouldn’t have noticed it.\n\nRecently, I’d been going crazy over the smallest, little details. If you know me, then you know I like my shit tidy. This is especially before I leave the house for work. Picturesque. My books have to be in alphabetical order on the shelves, the dishes organized in the washer, the carpet free of debris, my mattress made as if presented in a Raymour &amp; Flanigan line up. So, when I come home night after night and see dishes I remember cleaning in the sink, or my TV remote on the couch cushion—instead of on the stand next to the TV itself—you can see why this might raise my tail.\n\nWere these the early stages of dementia in my youth? Definitely didn’t want that to be the case. Recently, I been getting into scary podcast that feature some stories about unwanted guests living in people’s homes. Y’know, hiding inside vents, crawlspaces, and shit. This seemed likely, as I’ve also had the vague feels of being watched lately. Though, this was probably paranoia due to my recent habit of forgetfulness; however, the used-up toilet paper really drew the line for me. That was straight bizarre.\n\nPetty? Maybe. Better safe than sorry. In all truths, I wouldn’t have even bothered with the lengths of recording my own home if it weren’t for something I had in the trunk of my car. From there, I retrieved a teddy bear.\n\nNot your ordinary teddy bear, no sir. In actuality, it was a security camera. Never had an excuse to use this thing. The last owner of it, my father, used it to spy on the nanny that used to watch over my sister and me. My mother had gotten suspicious that our nanny had been going into her old jewelry case and stealing.\n\nCaught the bitch red handed.\n\nFor one reason or another, it was now in my possession. The camera was in the eye of the teddy bear, some duct tape covered where the cables would enter on the back. All I needed to do was plug the old toy into my laptop to see if it still functioned.\n\nTook a minute, but I got it running.\n\nThe bear was placed on a dresser in the living room, my laptop hidden between the dresser and wall. I’m not gonna lie, as mildly excited as I was to set it up, I kinda forgot about it. I’m an accountant who crunches hours, works overtime a lot. Come home, watch some television or read a book, then sleep.\n\nFor three whole days, things seemed normal enough.\n\nUntil the fourth day.\n\nWas a long shift. I approached my front door, tried the keys, and my door was already unlocked.\n\nI froze.\n\nShould’ve backed off, but masculine pride forced me to swing the door open.\n\nThe house was a mess, or my version of what a mess would look like.\n\nThe windows were wide open, more dishes in the sink. My television was on, which happened to be playing one of my favorite movies: The Ring. My couch cushions had imprints on them. Sat in one of them and the seat was warm. \n\nWanted to call the police right there, but there was one problem: nothing was stolen. Everything was fine, really. Things were out of place, but I knew the police weren’t gonna do shit. And between my perspiring hands and racing heart, maybe a part of me still wanted to believe this was all me being forgetful. If I was gonna call the police, I would need solid—\n\nThen I snapped. “The footage.”\n\nRan over to the bear, retrieved the laptop from underneath, and logged in. Still connected to the charger thanks to my foresight, but due to my negligence, I had days of continuous footage.\n\nI skimmed through a lot of it at first. Wasn’t interested in watching myself, and my old ass computer couldn’t jump too far ahead in the recordings without freezing for a bit.\n\nI’m taking out the trash, cleaning, eating, sleeping on the couch, yadda-yadda. Timestamp now displayed: \"12/27/22,\" the third day of recording out of the four, and I was only interested in whatever happened on the fourth day.\n\nThen a thought came to me that I didn’t know how to interpret.\n\nIt was difficult to land on footage of my home vacant. It was odd to me that at every attempt at jumping ahead, it always happened to land on me doing a variety of things. This didn’t make sense. More often than not, I should see an empty house.\n\nThis is when I really started paying attention to the timestamps.\n\n11:38am, I’m napping on the couch. . . even though I’m scheduled for work at 10:30am.\n\n“No...this ain't right,” I thought. “This time must be wrong.”\n\nSo, I tried something.\n\nClicked the video’s slider and ever-so-gently nudged it back to see what I was doing at a time where I would be getting ready for work. This would be about two hours prior from me being shown napping, and I got it on my first try.\n\n9:25am: footage of me getting into my work attire.\n\n“Okay. . . So, what the heck?” I said.\n\nWas certain there had to have been an error, a glitch in the system which distorted the footage at some point. I decided I’d spend the next hour or so making absolute sure I saw myself leave for work. If things were making chronological sense, there should be a jump cut or something indicating corrupted data, resolving the confusion.\n\nAt 10:11am, I tidy up the house like normal and leave for work.\n\nThen at 10:50am, shit you not, I come back into the house.\n\nNow my brows are scrunched together. “What? Did I forget something? I don’t remember forgetting a damn thing Tuesday.”\n\nNo, it wasn’t like that at all. It’s as if I left for work, came back minutes later, and was acting as if I’d come home after a long day. There were no jump cuts, the timestamps were consistent, and the kicker, the light coming from my living room windows didn’t change at all. Same tan skin tone, jawline, curly brown hair, my mannerisms, every damn criteria—this was myself down to the bone.\n\nI watched this other me go into the bathroom and take a shower, then take a nap later.\n\nSkimmed through more footage.\n\nThis other 'me' had woken up and did all the casual shit I might actually do until nighttime.\n\nForwarded more. Needed to see what this footage would show on a timestamp when I would normally be returning home.\n\nI usually return home by 11:40pm, but at 11:02pm, I’m checking myself out in my living room mirror, in my work attire.\n\nAt 11:30pm the footage shows other 'me' leaving home. At 11:43pm, actual me returns.\n\nI stared blankly at my screen.\n\n\"What about me coming home today?\" I thought\n\nBefore I can truly allow myself to react, I needed to see. Afterall, this was only footage from the 27th. Needed to know what the footage would show after I left for work on the 28th.\n\nThus, continued me skimming through.\n\nOn the 28th, I woke up in the morning, did my routine exactly how I remembered it. Got ready for work, I left, and whaddya know, this other 'me' comes right back in after about 20 minutes.\n\nExactly the same shit happens. Now that I’m truly taking time to analyze it, this other me is so noticeably sloppier. He touches things and doesn’t put them back properly, doesn’t clean up after himself. And probably doesn’t replace the empty roll in the bathroom, though I don’t have that specific view. For the most part, he does everything I would normally do at home up until it’s time for the actual me to come back from work. He leaves, I return minutes later, and I see myself react to my house being in disorder, up until I see myself approach the bear to check the footage. The recording ends.\n\nI spin around and peak through the blinds of all my windows. My meltdown begins. I pack all of my shit right then and leave for my sister’s place.\n\nThis whole ordeal happened about two weeks ago.\n\nWhat happened since then? Something did, but I don’t want to extend this post for too long.\n\nQuestions you might have:\n\n'Did you try posting the footage?'\n\nI tried several times. First on YouTube. Tried explaining the context in the description and everything. I was met with very little views, and the few comments I got called bullshit. Afterall, it’s merely footage of me leaving and entering my home. At first glance, big deal, right? After a few hours, the video got taken down by some “community guideline” thing. Tried Twitter, Instagram, Reddit, all with the same results. Can’t get this shit up anywhere.\n\nThe only reason I’m posting this now is because I was contacted by the owner of this account, Yoel, who offered an avenue in which I could at least share the details of my stories to some folk who might actually believe it.\n\nSo, that’s about it. For now. I’ll update soon, of course, but until then, I’ll leave you with this:\n\nWhile over at my sister's house, we discovered something while examining the first two days of footage, which were ones I hadn’t checked at first. There’s a moment where this other me is talking on the phone. Since it’s on speaker, we can hear the entire conversation.\n\nWe can hear the sound of my sister’s voice coming from the other line.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1098txf/why_i_dont_watch_movies_at_the_theatre_anymore/",
        "text": "   To start this story off I want to say that because of this incident I haven't been able to enjoy movies PERIOD! Me and a few other survivors of the incident are making attempts at group therapy.\n\n\n  For a little background information I loved movies. Anytime that I am available for one I would go to a movie theater or watch one on one of the many streaming services I have.\n\n\n  When me and my friends play a movie guessing game I always win and that's why we don't play those anymore. \n\n\n  I also have a movie review channel on YouTube which right now has about 60,000 subscribers. Sadly I had too quit it after the incident if you were wondering about that.\n\n\n  Anyways, one summer day I went to one of the major blockbuster movies that was showing at my favorite theatre. I went in, payed for my ticket, grabbed some popcorn and drinks, and went to the ticket holder.\n\n\n    \"Another day at the movies Sam?\" The ticket holder asked me.\n\n\n    \"You Bet Charlie\", I said to the ticket holder who me and him got accustomed too real well over the years.\n\n\n  \"I hear it's supposed to be a good one\", Charlie says to me.\n\n\n \"I hope so, if it is I'll post a vid about it on my channel\", I tell him.\n\n\n  Charlie nods and hands me back my ticket. \"See you on the other side\", he says and i nod to him as I make my way to the room thats showing the movie. I quickly scanned the aisle's as I find a good seat to sit.\n\n\n  A couple of minutes before the commercial's ended the whole room was packed.\n\n\n  (\"Good thing I came early\"), O thought to myself.\n\n\n  On the right side to me was a young woman with what looks like her boyfriend right beside of her. Also on the left was a middle aged fellow who looked like he also had some time on his hands.\n\n\n  I smiled a big smile as the movie was about to start and everyone started cheering.\n\n\n   The first few minutes the movie was going great. Everyone including me was enjoying themselves unless their was a few that tried to hide the fact that they should've picked a different film.\n\n\n Then, this is when it all started.\n\n\n As the scene the movie was on suddenly started to flicker black and white like it was glitching the screen. \n\n\n Then the whole movie screen turned black.\n\n\n  When this happened everyone got upset and started getting angry and saying stuff like \"we should go get a refund\". As people started getting up the screen turned back on again and pulling clapped as they went back to their seats thinking the person in the back fixed what was wrong. \n\n\n  I started back to eating my popcorn as the couple on my right looked like they were about too make out.\n\n\n  But the weird was the movie wasn't showing the movie we were watching. Now we opened up to a forest as the camera is smoothly traveling until it stopped at an old shack. It looked like the shack was liveable for a person or a family.\n\n\nThen we headed inside of the cabin as the front door opened and as the camera man went inside and shut the door. \n\n\n  The inside looked like your average log cabin out in the woods except it was old and rusty. Has a few animal heads posted on the walls. \n\n\n  By now a lot of people were asking questions and going as far as \"what the he'll\". Even a couple of people were going to head out the door.\n\n\n  As the scene stayed on the inside of that shack the people that were going to leave made some terrified noises. As all of us in the theatre looked in the direction we could see them open the door as it wouldn't budge.\n\n\n   \"What the hell?\" they said, \"Let us out!\" some screamed. Seeing this unfold my heart was beating out of my chest.\n\n\n  Then a couple of aisles in front of me a man screamed. As we all looked at his direction and crowded around him we saw in terror what he was screaming at.\n\n\n The woman sitting beside him had none of her facial features. She was just looking like a plain old mannequin. \n\n\n Then we heard another scream as someone pointed to the movie screen. The woman was inside the movie! She was screaming for help as she looked terrified. \n\n\n As this was happening an old man and another woman appeared on screen as we all looked and saw that they were also looking like mannequin's in the theatre but whole on the screen.\n\n\n   It went on like this until there was only 10 of us left.\n\n\n The people in the movie were trying to calm themselves down and looking around the shack for clues.\n\n\n That was when one of the first people looked in the direction of the so called \"camera man\" and screamed a bloodcurdling scream that the rest of us will remember for the rest of our life's. \n\n\n  As soon as the woman screamed the movie screen flashed off again leaving us in darkness.\n\n\n  Then as the screen once again flicked right back on it was a seen out of a horror movie.\n\n\n We all puked at the site as we were all trying to get out of the room but the doors were locked.\n\n\n The people that were just enjoying a movie with us a while ago were now strung apart throughout the whole shack. It was just pure terror looking in that screen as the titles supposed credits then went up. \n\n\n  At that moment the doors unlocked and we all burst through the doors. The employee's called the police as we were asked about what happened.\n\n\nAs the cops scoured the place we found out that the person that was the one that put the original movie in was found dead in the room.\n\n\n They took the movie that had the dead patrons and gave it too the government to see if they can figure out what happened.\n\n\n  So now you know our story. Why the rest of us won't go into the movie theatre again because we know it will happen to us next.\n\n\n Just take caution next time you do go into one. \n\n\n  And one final thing if you do: Please enjoy the movie for me.\n\n  ",

        "text": "My name is Mark and this is the first entry of my journal.\n\nI'm a patient at St. Mary's mental hospital. I want to start by explaining why I'm here and what led me to insanity. It's still hard to talk about it, but... Here we go.\n\nThree years ago, I broke up with Joanne. Joanne was a nice person, but... I lost attraction for her. Not that she was ugly or anything. I just... I had been with her for some years, we were high-school sweethearts and she kinda grew out of her cute phase. I'm aware I'm a jerk for saying this. Even worse, I said it to her, which was a huge mistake.\n\nJoanne didn't have much self-esteem,and breaking up with her because of her appearance completely destroyed her.\n\nIn the following weeks, she went through all the five stages of grief.\n\nFirst came denial. She kept texting me and calling me. \"Hey baby, is everything OK?\". \"You didn't mean it when you broke up, did you?\".\n\nThen came anger. She called me unholy names, keyed my car, etc. I was aware of how much of an ass I had been, so I let it go.\n\nCue bargaining. She'd call me saying she would lose weight, wear makeup, have surgery... None of that mattered and by this time I was growing tired of her behavior. It was also around this time when I met Chloe.\n\nAfter this I stopped hearing about Joanna. I assumed by then that the depression had set in, followed by acceptance.\n\nSo, Chloe. She was a beautiful woman, I met her at work, good ol' water cooler talk and whatnot. She had beautiful blue eyes, blond hair soft as silk and her face looked like that of a doll. It didn't take long before I asked her on a date.\n\nWe started hanging out and were a couple before long. Over the next few weeks she started staying over and I ended up giving her the key.\n\nA few months passed and everything was great. Until that day.\n\nI had been calling Chloe all day but she hadn't picked up once. She wasn't at work either and nobody had seen her since the day before. I had decided I would go home after work, take a shower, change clothes and head over to her house to check on her.\n\nWhen I got home, I immediately noticed something was wrong. My door was cracked open. I was sure I had locked it before leaving.\n\nWhen I got inside, there was something on the floor. I turned on the lights and I saw her. *Chloe*. She was laying face down on the floor on a puddle of... Blood.\n\nAs I was reaching down to hold her, I heard a sound coming from the bedroom. I realized we weren't alone. Heading for the bedroom, I grabbed the baseball bat I had in the hallway. The bedroom door was slightly open. I pushed it slowly, looking into the room as I entered. I couldn't see anyone.\n\nI went in, planning on checking the closet and the windows, when I heard the door closing and locking behind me. As I turned... I can't ever forget what I saw. I let out a scream and threw up when I saw her. Behind me, was Joanne, covered in blood. But that's not what caused my reaction. Over her face, crudely sewn, was... Chloe's face.\n\n\"*Am I beautiful now?*\"",

        "text": "On the night of October 31st, 1994, I came face to face with something that I still struggle to properly explain. For three years up to that crisp Halloween evening, a spate of unusual animal mutilations, an attempted kidnapping, and other unexplained events dominated the headlines in the sleepy town of Euryale, Ohio. It started during my senior year of high school, way back in 1991. Can’t believe that was so long ago now. I remember my dad reading the newspaper that day, October 14th. I sat down for a bowl of cereal and asked him what was going on, and he flipped the newspaper around to show me:\n\n**Grisly Scene of Animal Mutilation (from the Euryale Caller, October 14th, 1991)**  \nYesterday, passersby on West Northrop Street were greeted by a gory scene. In the empty lot between North Star Video and West Street Pizza, the bodies of two dogs and a cat were discovered, with a circular hole drilled into their skulls. According to the Sheriff’s office, the animals’ skulls were completely empty, and there were frozen patches in their skin. Nobody knows who or what mutilated these animals, but the perfectly circular holes make it seem like it is likely man made. When asked about the possibility that this is Satanic in nature, Sheriff Eisenhower said “We cannot rule out that possibility. Similar reports of animal mutilations have come out of Satanic ritual circles in other towns around the country. However, we should not jump to conclusions too quickly.”\n\nIt was shocking, definitely not the kind of thing that happens in a town like ours, but it wasn’t anything that would stop me from just going about my day. My dad and I had a short chat about what kind of messed up guy could’ve done something like that. I think he said something about the first step of a serial killer being hurting animals or something, and then I just left for school. \n\nI didn’t think about it much for the next three years, if I’m being honest. When there’s a new little pile of animal corpses each week, they just melt away into the background. It was surprising when a new kind of animal turned up dead, though. I remember being real shocked when all the horses that got brought into town for a hayride in September were found collapsed to the ground with their eyes, brains, and tongue missing. But nobody ever got caught doing it. They couldn’t even find any damn fingerprints on the animals. ‘Course, I now know why, but at the time it just made it so damn mysterious. People got real paranoid about it, and the Satanic ritual animal mutilation thing really caught on. I was already out of high school when they started doing it, but eventually they even had cops and “experts” come in to tell the kids about the dangers of, I don’t know, Dungeons and Dragons and metal music, I guess? They had no clue what they were talking about.\n\nWhat got me to actually pay attention happened three years into the borehole mutilations. I ended up getting a job at North Star Video, mostly ‘cause I was really into movies and needed the money. Anyway, it was September 1st, and we were decorating for the Halloween season. In addition to the fake cobwebs, orange and black streamers, and cheesy paper cutouts of Dracula, our boss at North Star came up with this great idea to make the security cameras get into the spooky spirit too. He bought these cheap rubber pumpkins, jack-o-lanterns, with the mouth gaping wide open for the lens of the camera to poke out through. So me and my coworker Daniel put the fake pumpkins on all the cameras, the ones outside too, the boss got real worried because of how many animal mutilations happened in the empty lot next to his store, then we finished up the rest of the decorating. I went home, but Daniel had the late shift, for the stoners and horror fans who needed something to watch at 10 PM. \n\nWhen I came in the next day, Daniel had this wild look in his eyes. He said there was something I had to see. Plopping me down in the chair behind the store’s front desk, he put in a tape, labeled September 1st, 1994 in frantic scribbled sharpie. Fast forwarding for a bit, breathing heavily, he got to the part he wanted to show me. It was the camera outside, the one pointed in the direction of the empty lot. I asked if it was just gonna be a couple of teenagers daring each other to hang out in the Bloody Pumpkin Patch, that was what teens had taken to calling it since there were always unkempt pumpkins growing there. He shook his head no and just pointed.\n\nUnder his fingertip, hidden in the blurry black and white noise of the security camera, I saw… something. I couldn’t really tell what it was. It was hunkered down in the farthest corner of the empty lot, on the pizzeria side, the shadows cast by the orange streetlights in the depths of the lot hiding most of whatever the hell it was. But what I could see were its *hands*. There weren’t just two. There had to have been like, at least five hands that I could make out, spindly fingers splayed out like the bony fins of a fish. Once he was sure that I saw it over there in the shadows behind the pizzeria, Daniel unpaused the recording. The arms swayed, like a flower in the wind. They didn’t seem locked together, they didn’t seem to be embracing. Eventually, two bony feet poke out from the shadows and into the streetlamp light.\n\nI chuckled and joked that it was probably some horny teens doing a group make out in the pumpkin patch, the arms we were seeing just looked weird ‘cause of the lighting. He just fast forwarded the video, passed by another hour of security footage at least, and pressed play. After a few moments, the high beams of a car passed over the empty lot, suddenly revealing what was hidden by the shadows. I could still only make out parts of it, the rest hidden by visual noise and streaks in the tape, but what I saw put to rest my rationalizations. It was a gaunt face with wide owl-like eyes, staring absentmindedly forward, all other features, whatever features it might have, obscured by visual noise. Daniel sat down on the counter next to the TV, and we just sat there in silence for a good bit, staring at the surreal image shoved away in the opposite corner of the empty lot.\n\nI asked “What the fuck was that?” He just shrugged his shoulders and rewound the video.\n\n“You know as much as I do, man. I just saw the recording this morning.” Pressing play, we rewatched the gentle swaying of the thing’s gaunt hands in the shadows.\n\n“And it wasn’t out there this morning? No sign of it?”\n\n“Nope, nothing at all. Not even any damn footprints, nada. Like it was just a damn glitch in the video, or, I dunno, a ghost or something.”\n\n“You can’t be serious man, it isn’t a ghost.”\n\n“What the fuck else could it be dude? It looks like something out of Ghostbusters!”\n\n“Real life isn’t a fucking movie dude!”\n\n“Look at it!” He stabbed at the screen right as the car’s passing headlights lit up the thing’s horrible face again. He ran his fingers through his hair and hopped down from the counter. “I… I gotta go home man, this is just, it’s freaking me the fuck out dude.”\n\n“Well that’s fine, your shift’s done anyway.”\n\n“No dude, like, I need to take the day off, like not even work the late shift even. Could you cover for me? Keep an eye on the security cameras?”\n\n“Sure, man, but you owe me one, aight?”\n\n“Yeah, I owe you one.” Picking up his bag, Daniel strode out the doors of North Star Video with just a sheepish little wave.\n\nThat’s how I remember the conversation going, anyway. I told the boss that Daniel needed to take the day off because of a family emergency, didn’t want to freak him out with the security cam footage. Just sat behind the counter and checked people out for movies they wanted to rent, from 9 AM to 10 PM. Only took breaks for lunch, dinner, and to get an energy drink from the convenience store down the street. Throughout the day, I’d check the security cameras, ‘specially the one facing the empty lot. Saw some strange fleeting movements on the edges of the camera at points during the day, but explained them away as pigeons, gulls, or raccoons. Wasn’t until the last hour of my shift that I saw that awful thing again.\n\nI remember I had just checked out a tape of Phantasm to these two twenty something girls, and started closing up for the night. That’s when I heard it, that horrible scratching and scraping sound, like a rusty screw being dragged over a chalkboard. It reverberated through the air behind the counter, took me a bit to place it but it was coming from the back wall, the one that faced the empty lot, the Bloody Pumpkin Patch. I put my ear up to the wall and heard its terrible vibrations sent through the bricks. Turning around from the wall, that’s when I saw it. That horrible awful thing was back in the security camera. I figured it had to have its face shoved right up against the rough red bricks on the video store side of the lot, its arms pointed at the bricks themselves. It was all the way on the edge of the camera, partially cut off at the edge of the screen, but I could still tell that awful thing was there.\n\nI rushed out to the empty lot, and I didn’t see a thing! Nothing was there! That multi-armed monster wasn’t there, nobody was there! I ran back into the store and checked the camera again, and sure enough, it was still there, and the awful grating sound was still there. It filled my ears like water, it just wouldn’t get out. I ran back outside, just to make sure, and it still wasn’t there. Thoroughly panicking now, I finished closing up and left about half an hour early. I didn’t want to have to think about it anymore, but the sound, the awful sound, and that awful thing not even being there didn’t leave my mind the whole night.\n\nI showed the video to Daniel the next day, and we talked about it some more. Didn’t really come to any conclusions, of course. He started feeling nauseous and had to go outside to get some air. Talking it over with him, I decided to try and get more info about what was going on with the empty lot, since you know, knowing is half the battle, isn’t it? I spent the next two months scouring newspapers, library books, and the web sites that were around back then. Before I explain what happened Halloween night, 1994, here are some of the most important discoveries that I made in my research.\n\n**Animal Mutilations Continue (from the Euryale Caller, October 19th, 1991)**  \nSince the discovery of three mutilated pets on West Northrop last week, four more animals have been found with similar wounds. Three were stray cats, and one was a seagull, all with perfectly circular holes drilled into their skulls. Sheriff Eisenhower had this to say about the discovery: “Whosoever is attempting to threaten or shock our community with these displays of brutality will be found. Such actions to animals, and the public display of their corpses, are illegal, and morally reprehensible, and the fine men at the Euryale Police Department will find you.” He also added “and, cat owners, please remember to spay and neuter your pets.”\n\n**A Seasonal Surprise (from the Euryale Caller, October 21st, 1991)**  \nDespite the terror of the recent events on West Northrop Street, there is still good seasonal cheer to be had! The empty lot has rapidly turned into an impromptu pumpkin patch, with some of the largest pumpkins the city has seen growing in the abandoned ground. Stephen Mendoza, current owner of the lot and surrounding business locations, encourages families to come by West Northrop Street for a free pumpkin to carve this Halloween season, and to check out the numerous shops that downtown Euryale has to offer!\n\n**Doggone in Downtown (from the Euryale Caller, October 25th, 1991)**  \nThree dachshunds were found dead, their skulls drilled into and all of their teeth and tongues removed, in the empty lot on West Northrop Street yesterday. The beloved pets of Mr. and Mrs. Mortimer on Shadowlawn Lane, the three pups went missing earlier this week before turning up at the empty lot, in similar disarray to previously discovered animals. Sheriff Eisenhower had this to say: “The disappearance of the Mortimers’ dogs and the continuing mutilations indicate that this is the act of an organized group, perhaps one deeply interested in the occult. We cannot at this time declare the intentions of the group, but the inscrutable patterns made by the poor dogs’ bodies imply something more than pranksters. My condolences go out to the Mortimers, who lost three good boys today.”\n\n\\[The above piece was corrected in the following edition, the editors retitling it due to “concerns over possibly perceived disrespect” in the original title.\\]\n\n**Attempted Child Kidnapping! (from the Euryale Caller, November 1st, 1991)**  \nLocal girl Callie O’Hare, age 12, reported that last night, while she was trick or treating with her mother at the shops downtown, she felt a hand attempt to yank her into an alleyway by the cape of her vampire costume. Neither she nor her mother saw the assailant, but Penelope O’Hare, who was holding Callie’s hand at the time, felt the tug as well. According to Callie, she felt fingers caress her neck, and in her words, “it was colder than January!” The O’Hare’s reported the attempted kidnapping to the police right away, and took their daughter home to eat her Halloween candy. Sheriff Eisenhower, when reached for comment, said that the attempt was under investigation and that a connection to the escalating animal mutilations could not be ruled out. He also urged parents to be extra careful with their children on Halloween.\n\nThe O’Hares were family friends of my mom and dad, and I actually remembered that Callie’s attempted kidnapping was big news at the time. Even in 1994, three years later, it still loomed large. Sheriff Eisenhower had used the publicity around the kidnapping to petition the city council for more funding and got it:\n\n**Increased Funding for Euryale PD (from the Euryale Caller, December 15th, 1991)**  \nThe Euryale city council has voted 5 to 2 to increase the budget of the Euryale Police Department by $350,000. This comes after the recent spate of animal mutilations, the attempted kidnapping of Callie O’Hare, and a rise in vandalism around town. Sheriff Eisenhower thanked the city council personally for the increase, which he says “will be put to good use tracking down the punks and thugs terrorizing this community.”\n\nI got my mom to ask Callie’s mom Penelope to let me meet with her. I made up some story about how I was interested in trying to submit some writing to the newspaper as a column and said that I wanted to interview Callie to ask about bullying at her high school. I ended up interviewing Callie on September 12th.\n\n**Excerpt from Interview with Calliope O’Hare (September 12th, 1994)**  \n“...So now that we’re done with that subject, there was actually something else I wanted to ask you about.”  \nCALLIE: “What’s that?”  \n“It, uh, has to do with what happened three years ago.”  \nCALLIE: “Oh. I don’t know if I really want to talk about it…”  \n“It’s alright, you don’t have to answer any questions you don’t feel comfortable with.”  \nCALLIE: “Alright then, I guess…”  \n“Could you describe, to the best of your memory, what happened Halloween night 1991?”  \nCALLIE: “Someone I didn’t see grabbed me from behind and tried to yank me into an alleyway down on West Northrop… I felt them pulling on the cape of my costume and um… felt their uh, fingers on the back of my neck.”  \n“You and your mom didn’t see who tried to grab you, but did anyone you know see who it could be?”  \nCALLIE: “Well, Billy told me in school later that week that he saw what tried to grab me but I didn’t believe him.”  \n“Billy?”  \nCALLIE: “Billy Hofstadter, he was in the seventh grade.”  \n“You said he claims to have seen *what* tried to grab you? Not who?”  \nCALLIE: “He said it was a monster! Even though he was a year older than me, Billy was always more of a kid.”  \n“Did he say what this monster looked like?”  \nCALLIE: “I don’t know… He said it had a lot of arms, I remember that, but not much else.”  \n“To connect back to our larger topic, did it feel like he was bullying you, making fun of you?”  \nCALLIE: “Well yeah at first, I was so mad that he’d poke fun at me when I was just almost kidnapped! But I realized he was being dead serious.”  \n“Did anyone bully you after the incident?”  \nCALLIE: “No, most people were pretty supportive… Lots made fun of Billy though, once he started being more open about what he saw… I don’t think he deserved that really.”  \n“Now, back when the incident happened you said that the fingers of whatever, whoever it was that tried to kidnap you uh… you said they were ‘colder than January,’ what did you mean by that?”  \nCALLIE: “What do you think I meant?”  \n“Well, could you elaborate?”  \nCALLIE: “I… I just… it felt like the little patches of my skin were dunked in, I don’t know, the ocean down in Antarctica. It was so, so cold… I uh… I don’t show people these, very often, but I know you and we’re… on the topic of it, I guess so…”  \n\\[Here, Callie turned away from me and lifted up her hair. On the back of her neck were five little bluish grey spots with flakey skin all around.\\]  \n“What is that?”  \nCALLIE: “Don’t know… My mom didn’t know. No doctors know either. It’s like my skin got freezer burned permanently.”  \n\\[She turned back to face me.\\]  \nCALLIE: “That’s what I got out of that whole ordeal. That and, the idea of… of getting taken away… I don’t want to get taken away, I hate the idea that whoever tried to grab me is still out there watching me and, and it’s just, it’s just so scary, it’s so scary…”  \n\\[At this point, she started tearing up. I attempted to console her, but Penelope came into the room and saw me with my hand on her daughter as she was gently crying, and got angry at me upsetting her. She asked me to leave and I obliged, apologizing to Callie on the way out.\\]\n\nBilly Hofstadter was another lead. I tried to find him, but it turned out his family moved away in 1993. According to his friends, it was because he was being ruthlessly bullied. I couldn’t find him for an interview, but I found him online. This was only a year after the ‘net even became widely publicly available, but I had been an early adopter and, it seems, so was Billy. He must have fled to the safety of the early internet, fled the bullying and the loss of his friends when his family moved away. Turns out he had a personal site where, among other things, he posted an account of what he had seen.\n\n**I Know What I Saw (uploaded to Billy Hofstadter’s website August 16th, 1994)**  \nThree years ago I saw what tried to take Callie O’Hare. Some of you might not know who that is, if you’re from the Columbus area though I can’t see how you wouldn’t. According to the official story, she was almost kidnapped by someone that her and her mom didn’t see, on Halloween night 1991. But I saw it. Everyone at school made fun of me for talking about it, called me a weirdo and a nerd and a schizo, but I knew what I saw.   \nI was across the street from her at the time, in this costume I made with a pumpkin for a head and big claw gloves. I heard her yelp when she was yanked back, and looked over and saw it. It was taller than Callie’s mom, and so pale white. It had so many arms, swaying in the air like underwater. Its face was terrible. Big wide eyes and a little tiny lipped mouth that had the tiny tips of teeth poking out. It was grabbing Callie by the cape of her vampire costume, and she was trying to pull out from its grasp. I don’t think it saw me. Its eyes were looking at me but they didn’t look like they had anything behind them. Just sorta staring. I still remember that awful awful awful face.  \nI don’t know if it was a ghost or a demon or an alien or whatever but I know what I saw.\n\nIn the next few years after the Callie incident, the strange events surrounding the Bloody Pumpkin Patch down on West Northrop street continued:\n\n**Total Count of Animal Mutilations by Year and Type (October 14th 1991 to October 1st 1994)**  \n1991:  \n7 dogs, 12 cats, 6 seagulls, 11 pigeons, 3 rabbits  \n1992:   \n13 dogs, 26 cats, 14 seagulls, 25 pigeons, 4 horses, 4 rabbits, 1 raccoon  \n1993:   \n4 dogs, 21 cats, 21 seagulls, 36 pigeons, 12 rabbits, 3 raccoons  \n1994:  \n6 dogs, 15 cats, 32 seagulls, 34 pigeons, 13 rabbits, 4 raccoons\n\n**Sheriff and Humane Society Urge Keeping Pets Indoors (from the Euryale Caller, July 14th, 1992)**  \nWith the end of the animal mutilation epidemic nowhere in sight, the Euryale PD and Central Ohio Humane Society have come together in urging all pet owners to keep their furry friends indoors. No more leashing your dog up in the yard, and no more outdoor cats! This policy is until further notice.\n\n**Satanic Graffiti in Downtown Euryale (from the Euryale Caller, July 26th, 1992)**  \nPentagrams! Goats! The mark of the beast! All these dark and terrible symbols have recently been emblazoned on the sides of businesses in downtown Euryale, especially in the empty lot on West Northrop street. Sheriff Eisenhower vowed to catch the delinquents that are to blame for the flurry of graffiti.\n\n**Anti-Satanism Rally Downtown (from the Euryale Caller, August 2nd, 1992)**  \nLocal group Parents for a Safe Euryale hosted an anti-Satanic event in downtown yesterday, protesting the continuing Satanist threat to Euryale. A major speaker at the event was Penelope O’Hare, mother of Calliope, who was almost kidnapped last year. Mrs. O’Hare gave an impassioned speech where she called out the people who have been terrorizing this community for the past year and stated her belief that “those monsters who tried to take my Callie away, they wanted to use her in their ritual abuse, maybe even kill her like they’ve been doing to all the animals around town. Well I just have one thing to say to you: you’re not going to get away with it!”\n\n**Teen Vandals Found! (from the Euryale Caller, August 6th, 1992)**  \nThe teenagers behind the satanic graffiti around downtown from last month have been arrested and charged with vandalism. High school students Kyle Burbank, Joseph Chen, and Bri Young are likely to face a fine and community service time when taken to court later this month. However, despite Sheriff Eisenhower’s efforts, nothing connects the three teens with the spate of animal mutilations that have plagued this town for the past year. The ultimate cause of the crisis remains to be seen.\n\n**Forensic Expert Weighs in on Animal Mutilations (from the Euryale Caller, September 23rd, 1992)**  \nWith the recent shocking killing of the town’s four autumn hayride horses, injuries identical to those of the dozens of other mutilations that have plagued this town for the past year, the Euryale Caller reached out to professor of forensic science at Ohio State University Gary Turnbull for some insight into the mysterious massacres in this special editorial. We here at the Euryale Caller encourage reader discretion, given the nature of the topic discussed.  \n*On why these animals might be being targeted:*  \n“Well, killing animals is not uncommon for a sociopathic or psychopathic personality. The issue with the Euryale animal mutilations is that there does not seem to be a distinct pattern to the killings, other than them being animals that are common around the downtown area, namely stray cats and dogs, pets, and some birds. It’s hard to pinpoint any clear motivation when there’s no distinct pattern.”  \n*On the recent horse mutilations:*  \n“The horses are much more curious. Since they were a more prominent target, what with them being brought in especially for hayrides, it may indicate an intention to intimidate the community. The killings of pest animals and strays don’t fit that, but it may explain the horses.”  \n*What do you think they may be using to kill the animals?*  \n“That’s hard to say. While there isn’t a pattern to which animals are targeted, the injuries are surprisingly consistent. Small frostbitten spots, superficial really, paired with a single perfectly circular borehole through the skull and all of the contents of the skull, including brain, eyes, tongue, all removed. My immediate thought is that the perpetrators would have to be using some kind of power tool, like a drill with a wide drill bit, but I think it would be very difficult to hold down a dog, or a horse for that matter, and drill into it. At the very least it would require a group of people to pull off, but there have been no signs of significant struggle and no fingerprints found on any of the animals. And I have no idea what may have caused the spots of frostbite.”  \n*Do you have any possible leads on who may be doing this or why?*  \n“Well, I’m not the police. But even if I were, I don’t think I would. I’ve seen some people there in Euryale saying it’s a satanic group, and I guess there’s a chance of that, but it seems unlikely to me. I really have no idea.”\n\n**The Strangest Pumpkin Yet (from the Euryale Caller, October 25th, 1992)**  \nLast year, when pumpkins started growing in the empty lot on West Northrop street, they were made freely available to any families who might want a pumpkin to carve. This year, the offer stands; but fewer families are taking it. Children have been put off by the appearance of increasingly unusual pumpkins, including one gourd which looks strangely like a ghoulish face! While the kids might be scared by it, whatever family picks up the ghoul gourd won’t have to go through the trouble to make it spooky!\n\n**Frozen Brain Found Under Bridge (from the Euryale Caller, January 6th, 1993)**  \nWhat appeared to be the brain of a dog was found frozen solid beneath the bridge connecting West Northrop and the highway. With the mysterious events that have been plaguing the town for the past year and a half, this brain befuddlement just adds another thing to everyone’s plate. It is unclear to what individual animal the organ belonged, but Sheriff Eisenhower is sure it connects to the satanic animal mutilation scare.\n\nI also tried to read up on everything to do with the paranormal, I was certain there was a pattern here that connected with that awful thing we saw in the security camera, but I just didn’t have a clue what it could do other than kill animals and no clue what could stop it. Higher dimensions, psychic phenomenon, ghosts, making a circle of salt to keep out evil spirits, hell even Project Blue Book and Project Tuatara, I figured there had to have been *something* out there relevant to this thing. I never really reached any conclusion, but I got a big container of salt and some holy water just in case. What I did connect was the significance of pumpkins. Pumpkins started growing in the empty lot after the first animal mutilations, I saw the thing through a pumpkin on the security camera, Billy Hofstadter saw it through his pumpkin mask, there were weird pumpkins growing like humanoid faces in the empty lot, I knew this thing had something to do with pumpkins. With the security camera and the Hofstadter report as my basis, I got a pumpkin big enough to fit my head in, snagged it from the empty lot next to North Star Video actually, and carved it into a jack-o-lantern.\n\nWhatever this thing was, it was getting bolder. Ever since ‘91 there were more and more animals killed, and while nothing was as scary as when it tried to snatch Callie or when it killed those horses, I figured it would try again. The least I could do, I figured, was protect the kids in my hometown. So, with my research and a plan prepared, I set out on Halloween night to do just that.\n\nHere’s what my plan was: I would wear the pumpkin like a mask, so I could still see the thing. It was Halloween so I figured I could pass as someone going to a party or something. I’d have the salt and the holy water, which I figured I could rely on for spiritual self defense, and a pocket knife just in case that would work on it. I would just linger around the empty lot on West Northrop, where I knew the creature must be centered on since everything tied back to it, and warn kids away so that what almost happened to Callie wouldn’t happen for real this time. \n\nThe night of October 31st, 1994 came and I went out with my jack-o-lantern on my head, all prepared to camp out there for hours to keep the trick or treaters safe. I won’t lie, I think there was a part of me that felt a little pride in actually knowing what was going on and trying to do something about it to protect the kids, felt like I was doing more than the satanic panic people were. Anyway, I got down to the empty lot and… I came face to face with it. \n\nIt was even worse in person than it was on the fuzzy screen. I had never actually seen the whole thing before. On the camera it was hidden partially in shadow, only an arm here or an eye there poking out into the faint streetlight or the light of a passing car. I finally saw it. It was seven, maybe eight feet tall, and pale as a sheet of paper. Its legs were so long and skinny, barely skin and bones even, with bony feet that looked like they barely even touched the ground. On top of its pallid torso, all the ribs starkly visible, was a flower of gently swaying pulsating skeletal arms with a terrible ghoulish face in the center. Ten arms in total, a sea anemone of waving limbs. Its eyes were piercing but had nothing behind them. Like a blind animal always staring out. A deep sea owl.\n\nWhen I first saw it it was standing next to one of the street lights, looming over a little boy with his mom trick or treating. I rushed over and interrupted the mom talking to her son and tried to convince them to cross the street. I could hear the thing’s haggard watery breathing, the feeling of icy cold water spewed out of ribcage gills crawling down my hoodie. I could tell the mom thought I was crazy, but she ended up crossing the street anyway, furtively glancing back at me over her shoulder. I didn’t really care if I looked crazy so long as I got kids to safety.\n\nI looked up at it and it was staring at me. It didn’t reach for me or anything but it was staring at me. I tried to shoo it away and got it to move off from the streetlight. A couple more families trick or treating with their kids that I got to cross the street to the side away from the thing. It just silently stared at me with its mane of arms gently swaying in the crisp fall wind. I felt it get closer to me, ice crystals forming on my feet, causing me to panic and kick off the ice, brandishing my pocket knife in an effort to push the creature back. I saw several more parents whispering to their kids and rushing them along as they saw what, to their eyes, was presumably a crazy person wearing a pumpkin on their head yelling at thin air and brandishing a knife. I ended up getting the creature back into the empty lot, and decided to cover the open side of the lot with a line of salt, to try and contain it.\n\nIt didn’t do anything to stop me. Just stared. Honestly, the staring eyes were even worse than any actual thing it could have done to me. I didn’t even know what it could do. Or, at least, I didn’t at first. While I was laying down the salt line, a crow flew into the empty lot and landed on a pumpkin. To my horror and disgust, I saw the thing reach down with one of its ten terrible arms and, with another, drill into the skull of the poor bird. Its fingertip turned into a round spinning bore. I lifted the pumpkin off my face for just a moment to see what the whole process even looked like and… jesus christ, it still fucks me up to this day to remember this, I just saw the crow floating in midair, its black feathers contrasted against the pale bricks on the back of the empty lot, spewing blood and brain matter from its tiny bird skull. And in an instant, the crow was dead, falling to the ground, splattering on a pumpkin on the way down. When I put the pumpkin back on, the thing had just returned to absentmindedly swaying in the wind, no different than it was before it… devoured? the crow. I don’t even know if it ate it, I have no idea what or why it did that it just… did it.\n\nAnyway, I guess after about an hour and a half of me pushing parents to walk on the other side of the road, yelling at nothing, brandishing a knife, and pouring salt on the ground, someone reported me to the cops. A while after the thing killed that crow a cop showed up and started talking to me. I tried to explain to him what I was doing but he just looked at me funny. I avoided mentioning the looming monster that I was dealing with but even without that it just made no sense and he ended up arresting me. There were still kids out trick or treating and I had no idea if the salt line would even really contain the thing but I was being taken away for questioning.\n\nI was antsy and nervous, panicking because I had just realized that there was an invisible terror, a horror nobody could see or even deal with, that had been terrorizing the town for three years and had almost kidnapped a kid and would do it again any day now, and here I was in a jail cell for the night not able to do anything about it. Sheriff Eisenhower himself questioned me. I don’t remember everything he asked me but one bit stuck out, still sticks with me to this day.\n\n“None of your excuses will get you out of this, boy. We already had our eyes on you after you made Callie cry.”\n\n“What? How did you find out about that?” I retorted.\n\n“None of your concern. People care about their kids in this town, y’hear? Nobody took well to your little stunt out there, and nobody has been taking well to your prying either. I need you to answer for what’s been going on, this town needs you to.”\n\n“But I didn’t do anything! I was trying to protect our kids!”\n\n“Hanging out with a pumpkin on your head near where there have been Satanic animal mutilations and an attempted kidnapping are not things that you do to protect kids. I don’t care if we find your fingerprints on anything or not, you have something to do with all this. I know you do.”\n\nThat’s what I remember, anyway. It may have just been his attempt to intimidate me, but it struck me as so true. The cops and the moms and everyone didn’t care if I actually did anything, and I didn’t! There was no proof! I even got dragged into court for the next couple months, just removed from life until December, sitting in the courthouse in the county seat while lawyers talked about shit they didn’t know a single thing about. And I couldn’t say anything about it, it was either keep silent about what I really saw and hopefully get by on the lack of definitive evidence or talk about the creature I saw and have everyone see me as a madman. The jury declared me innocent on the charges but that didn’t matter, not to the cops and the moms and everyone else. Nobody in Euryale trusted me anymore. Sheriff Eisenhower got what he wanted; he got reelected that November on his “hard on Satanism” platform, using me as a scapegoat. I even lost my damn job at North Star Video. I had to go, the town forced me out all for trying to do what I could to protect people. I moved out in February 1995 and have never been back. \n\nI knew that that creature was still there. Nothing had changed. From what my mom and dad told me, the animal mutilations never stopped. And then it reached a peak in 1998 when some kid, Sally Washington, disappeared without a trace. I knew what happened to her, but none of them would listen. They gave up on me and I gave up on them. This is the first time I’ve ever told anyone about this. Just had to get it off my chest.",

        "text": "Back in 2015, my roommate and I were in our senior year of college. In those four years, we went from sharing the same dorm, to renting a two bedroom apartment off-campus. So, I’d say I knew him pretty well.\n\nOne Monday morning, we were working on our capstone projects when we received a flyer from two of our fellow classmates asking for volunteers to test out a gaming system they had developed. Hoping we would be interested in testing it for two weeks, they offered fifty bucks as payment.\n\nPersonally, I was all for it. But, having history with the two developers, my roommate had issues. Something about how “any idiot can become an engineer these days”. I didn’t understand it, but sometimes my roommate could be a grouch, so I just took it with a grain of salt.\n\nMy roommate and I were avid gamers. Most of our weekends were spent on the living room couch trying to one up each other in some way shape or form, so I knew he secretly wanted to try it out. It took some convincing, but eventually he agreed, and we, along with some other friends, attended the meeting to learn everything we could about a headset they called, Gallus.\n\nTo be honest, I thought it was a pretty cool device. Part VR, part smart glasses, the headset was able to analyze your surroundings and incorporate the game into that area. Whatever space was programmed became part of the game itself, and by using your hands, you could select items, shoot targets, and grab objects.\n\nAt a time when VR and smart glasses were fairly new to market this was some pretty amazing stuff. And, even though it was a solo thing and we couldn’t play together, my roommate and I were definitely interested in being testers.\n\nBack home in our apartment, my roommate and I decided that we would use our separate bedrooms as a game space; leaving the living room and kitchen free, so we wouldn’t interfere with each other as we played. We then went to work on setting it up.\n\nTurning on the Gallus, it began by asking how many rooms needed to be programmed, and, as per our agreement, I entered the number one. Then, step by step, it analyzed all four walls, the ceiling, and the floor from the center of my room, and, within a few minutes, it was ready to go.\n\nBefore I started, I looked through the pamphlets that came with each game. I had no idea what was downloaded. Earlier, when the developers asked what kind of games I would be interested in, I simply told them to surprise me. My only request was that they leave out anything that had to do with horror. I hated horror games; unlike my roommate, who was the first to jump at that opportunity.\n\nMy first week with the Gallus was amazing. It felt like I was in a completely new world. I could still see everything in my room, but, with the Gallus, it was all different. For example, one night, my whole room became sand dunes that overlooked the pyramids; another night, my bed was a raft that floated on the ocean. In a different game, I solved puzzles and riddles as I escaped my “locked” room, and, in another, I dodged and smashed large shapes as they flew towards me from every direction.\n\nIt was all so captivating, that, before I knew it, I had put hours into the device. In the past week, all I managed to do was eat, sleep, attend class, and game; I almost forgot I had a roommate. So, Sunday night, I decided to check in.\n\nI strolled across the living room and playfully knocked on his door. No response. I knew he was home, his keys were on the kitchen counter, so I tried again. Still nothing. Turning the handle, the door opened slightly.\n\nInstantly, I was hit with a smell that almost brought me to my knees. A musky, sour mixture of urine and body odor filled my nose and stuck to the back of my throat, triggering an immediate gag response. Luckily I hadn’t eaten anything, or the contents of my stomach would have been on the floor.\n\nI tried to open the door further, but something heavy was in the way. With a hard push, the object scraped across the floor, giving me enough room to squeeze through. That’s when I saw him.\n\nHis headset was on and his clothes were tattered. Looking like a pale marble statue, he stood in the center of his room, surrounded by a puddle of his own urine. \n\nI yelled his name, no response. I grabbed something close by and threw it at his chest, still nothing. Not knowing what else to do, I ran over and yanked the headset off.\n\nImmediately, a scream erupted from his mouth, and his arms flailed around as he fought the air in front of him. Dodging the incoming blows, I grabbed his arms and lowered him to the floor, where he curled up feebly into the fetal position.\n\nHorrified, I stared at a deranged, haggard version of my roommate, who looked as if he hadn’t eaten in days. The bags under his eyes stretched well below his cheek bones as if sleep had been ignored for nights on end, and his eyes darted rapidly while he mumbled incoherently under his breath. \n\nCrouching to get closer, I lightly tapped his shoulder causing him to flinch, but focus on my face. Soon after, the mumbling stopped and he gained control of his breathing. I helped him slowly sit up straight, and, after a few episodes of paranoid fits, he hung his head between his knees and sighed.\n\nI stayed there patiently while he gathered himself, and took in the full view of what had become of his room.\n\nEverything was turned upside down and thrown around the room. His bedside table was wedged against the door, and anything that had been pinned to the walls was now ripped or broken and tossed across the floor.\n\nIn complete shock, I looked down at my roommate, who stared up at me with a wide, toothy grin. “I’ll find it,” was all he said.\n\nAfter getting him to his feet and convincing him to shower, I brought in some cleaning supplies. Thankfully, he insisted on cleaning everything himself, so I made my way to the kitchen to make us some food. \n\nWe sat down to eat, but he hardly touched a thing, claiming that he was too tired and needed to sleep; he had classes in the morning. I reluctantly agreed and watched as he shuffled into his room and closed the door behind him.\n\nDeciding it was time I did the same, I retired to my room and went to bed.\n\nSome time after midnight, I woke suddenly to the same horrified scream from earlier. Launching out of bed, I ran to the living room to find my roommate, with his headset on, standing outside his bedroom and pointing at something inside.\n\nRushing toward him, fully prepared to knock the Gallus off his head, I noticed that he wasn’t even wearing it over his eyes. Instead, it was pulled back, revealing his full face, which was twisted in complete terror.\n\nFollowing the direction of his hand, I saw that he was pointing at his bedroom window. The cool breeze inside let me know that it was open, but I didn’t understand why that scared him so much. We lived on the first floor, maybe someone walked by or something. I stuck my head out to look, but all I saw was the plush green grass that surrounded the building. \n\nConfused, I turned back to my roommate, who was no longer in the doorway. Instead, he was wandering the living room, his headset back on.\n\nToo freaked out to argue with him in this state, I went back to my room, locked the door, and attempted to sleep. We had a midway meeting with the developers later that day, maybe they would have some answers.\n\nTreating that day as normal, I hurried to meet my roommate and grab a bite to eat before my first class. As I crossed the campus, I spotted him in the courtyard and raised my hand to get his attention, but stopped when I noticed him acting strange. \n\nHe was walking with a purpose, his head darting back and forth, as if something invisible was following him. This erratic behavior continued, as he scrambled across the lawn and up the stairs into the engineering building.\n\nGenuinely concerned, I hoped that he was getting help, or at least turning in his Gallus, but I didn’t have time to follow. Instead, I continued to the cafeteria, and I resolved to ask about it later.\n\nWhen my last class ended, I went to meet the developers. Only one was there, so it was a pretty quick meeting on his end. He asked how everything was going and if I had any problems with the device. I told him that I personally loved the Gallus and thought it worked perfectly, but I was afraid my roommate was having some issues.\n\nThe developer confessed that my roommate had come in about that earlier, but he wasn't having issues with the device itself. He was more concerned about a game. Supposedly, he was having a hard time beating it, and had become a little obsessed.\n\nThis did sound a little like him, he could get obsessive about gaming, but never this bad. I pressed the developer about the issue, but he insisted that’s all it was. Instead, he offered a solution. He suggested that I play the game myself, maybe I could figure out how to help him.\n\nAt the time, it wasn’t a bad idea. There was only one problem, I hated horror games. \n\nTo ease my nerves, the developer assured me that the game wasn’t bad. He even admitted that the objective was simple once you got into it.\n\nSeeing no other option, I took him for his word, and agreed to let him download it.\n\nI came home to a quiet apartment. Taking it as a good sign, I hoped that it meant my roommate was getting a break from the Gallus. Besides, he had nothing more to worry about because I was determined to get whatever he was trying to find.\n\nFiring up the Gallus, I went to the new game, *The Shadow of Hanbi*, and tapped play.\n\nImmediately, the room darkened around me, the only things visible were trace outlines of my furniture and walls. In my ears, an eerie song, much like a broken music box, began to play. The atmosphere alone was enough to make me want to stop, but I had to continue.\n\nLooking around, I saw a dimly lit trail leading to a floating object in the corner of my room. Given my experience with games, I knew it was something I would need. So without hesitation, I walked toward the object, but suddenly stopped mid stride. \n\nSomewhere behind me, the sound of a high pitched, breathy cackle hit the backs of my ears causing the hairs on my neck to stand up. Unable to move, I listened closely as dragging footsteps slowly approached, getting closer and closer with every step.\n\nI stood board straight, chills running down my spine. A lump formed in my throat, making it hard for me to breathe, and the sound of my heart pounded rapidly in my ears.\n\nQuickly, I reached out and grabbed the object in front of me. The word FLASHLIGHT appeared across the screen, and my hand glowed like a lightbulb.\n\nI twirled around to face whatever it was. Nothing. It was gone. I stood there panting, relieved, but it was only temporary.\n\nSuddenly, the whole right side of my body went on alert as every touch receptor sparked across my arm and leg. Whatever it was, wasn’t gone. In fact, it was standing right beside me. \n\nSlowly, I turned my head to look right, and instantly lost my breath. Eye to eye with me was a pale, sunken face connected to a black, straggly body. Wiry black strands of hair dangled over massive eyes that bulge from their sockets, locking you in place with dark, empty irises. A thin, angular mouth connected one side of its face to the other, that slowly opened wide revealing bone snapping teeth. The only thing separating us were its two large slender hands that longingly reached out to cup my face.\n\nI couldn’t move on my own, as I watched the creature slowly inch forward. Instead, my body responded automatically by folding up and crumbling beneath me. Once I hit the floor, the Gallus fell off my head, bringing everything back to normal.\n\nKicking the device to the far side of the room, I sat in silence while tears rolled down my cheeks, and I held in the need to vomit. Never, never again.\n\nI don’t know how long I sat there, it could have been minutes or hours, but eventually I was able to get to my feet.\n\nStarving, but not sure if I could eat, I walked out into the kitchen when again I was stopped mid stride. The apartment door was wide open. \n\nRunning over to the door, I stretched my neck out into the hallway, and looked one way, then the next. I froze with fear. All the way at the end of the hall stood a tall black figure with a pale, sunken face. Lifting its hand, it waved.\n\nHoping that it was all in my head, I quickly closed my eyes then opened them back up. To my relief, it was gone.\n\nI went back in the apartment, and found everything still in place. The only difference, my roommate’s keys now sat on the kitchen counter. \n\nFreaked out by the day I was having, the wide open door, and his complete lack of sense, I ran over and banged on his door. No answer. Harder this time, still no answer. I’d had enough. With a hard shove, I burst through, and there he was. \n\nHe was laying across his bed, the headset on, with a twisted look of terror on a pale, lifeless face. The official report said he had a cardiac arrest, but I didn’t believe it.\n\nSeveral days later, an arrest was made for the harassment and attempted murder of another classmate at our university. Rumors said my roommate's death was tied to that. But, again, I didn't believe it.\n\nI knew it was The Shadow of Hanbi that killed him, and I’ll never believe otherwise. To this day, I still have regrets about how it all went down. I should have talked to him more, or tried harder to help him. Maybe then, he’d still be here.",

        "text": "It’s been a year and two days since Kyle, Andrew, and I first stepped foot into the decrepit old house at the end of our street. As I pushed the door open, the smell of wet dirt and mildew twirled into my nose.\n\n“Real romantic spot, smooth stuff,” Kyle scoffed at me.\n\n“Hey! I have an idea turd burglar, why don’t we bring the girls over to your house so your mom can walk in and bust us!” I rolled my eyes.\n\n“Whatever,” Kyle huffed.\n\nWe pulled out a couple candles from Andrew’s backpack and lit them, setting them strategically through the room, trying to drive the gloom out. The girls should be here soon.\n\n“So, Andrew, figured out how you’re going to convince Abby to give a guy like you the time of day?” I wiggled my eyebrows. Andrew had been down lately. He hadn’t said anything, but Kyle and I had noticed. It was a big part of why we’d hit up Abby’s friends to set this whole thing up. He’d had the hots for Abby for a long time, but he was cripplingly shy and completely inexperienced with girls as a result.\n\nHe responded by throwing his backpack at me. Before I could retaliate, the front door creaked open. Abby, Chelsea, and Malorie walked in.\n\n“Hey ladies,” Kyle greeted, flashing a lopsided grin, “I brought a refreshment!” He presented an empty coke bottle.\n\nHe laughed as he placed it in the center of the circle that had formed as the girls sat down. Abby pushed her dark hair out of her face and smiled at Andrew.\n\n“Smooth, Kyle,” I cringed.\n\n“Right to it, huh?” Malorie giggled.\n\n“Me first!” Abby grabbed the bottle and pointed its tip towards Andrew before spinning it hard. As the bottle was still in motion, the front door opened again.\n\nChelsea yelped as a boy near our age confidently strolled in.\n\n“Closed party?” he asked. \n\nI hopped to my feet, “Something like that. I didn’t know anybody else came here.”\n\nIn the dim lighting, his eyes looked completely black. Something about him made my stomach feel icy.\n\nThe boy smirked as the bottle stopped with the cap end pointing at Andrew.\n\n“I like to play games too,” he grinned, “got room for one more?” The boy squeezed between Andrew and Kyle without waiting for an answer.\n\n“We can’t play spin the bottle with an odd number,” Malorie interjected, “How about truth or dare instead? And what’s your name?”\n\n“I don’t believe I picked Truth yet, did I?” the mystery boy asked.\n\nKyle staged whispered to Andrew, “Want me to dare you to kiss Abby?” Andrew blushed and slugged Kyle on the shoulder as the rest of us hooted. The boy sat expressionless, waiting.\n\n“Abby,” Malorie started, “Truth or dare!”\n\nAbby didn’t hesitate, “Dare!”\n\n“I dare you to go in the other room for fifteen seconds *by yourself*!”\n\n“Lame,” Abby muttered, glancing towards Andrew as she left the group. \n\nInternally, I groaned. This wasn’t going as planned at all. We were supposed to get Andrew comfortable enough with Abby for us to go home. Malorie had basically invited the new guy to hang out with us and now she was intentionally dragging this out. A part of me suspected that she knew him.\n\nAbby shuffled in and sat back down with the group.\n\nThe boy scoffed.\n\n“Truth or dare, new boy?” Malorie teased.\n\n“Truth, always,” he responded with a small smile.\n\n“What’s up your ass?”\n\nThe smile fell into a scowl. “Mostly, Malorie, this is stupid. Every one of you has limited time left and this is what you do with it? Completely wasted. Childish. We all have a role to play, and here the six of you are, fucking it up. That’s what’s ‘up my ass’ as you put it. But wouldn’t you rather ask me something more interesting?”\n\nAll of us were stunned into silence. Embarrassment glowed brightly on Malorie’s cheeks.\n\nFinally, Chelsea broke the silence, “Something more interesting like what?”\n\nThat uncomfortable grin kissed his lips again, “Like when you’ll die, of course. I’m in a giving mood tonight. I can tell you all about it.”\n\nMy stomach flipped with the realization that this kid was psychotic. \n\n“Like you, Chelsea, you die of a heart attack at your desk at work at 47!” his eyes shined brightly in the candlelight.\n\n“And you, Kyle, you die falling off a boat at 42. You drown,” he faked a gag, “You’re a bloater, in case you were wondering, not a floater. It takes them nearly a week to find you! And you, Malorie, you die of the flu at 61,” he scoffed, “So boring. And Alex,” I flinched at the sound of my name, “you’ll die of lung cancer at 50. It hurts so, so bad when you can’t breathe. Keep sucking ‘em down! Abby, I’ll be seeing you again soon. Very soon. You die at 17. Do you want to know how?”\n\nThe boy’s broad, toothy smile took up far too much of his bony face. Abby started to cry softly. The boy took that as an affirmative answer.\n\n“You die in a car accident. Your mother is driving. She hits a tree!” he exclaimed gleefully. “And Andrew, I’ll be seeing you soonest of all. I think we both already knew that though, didn’t we?” The boy nodded slowly as he faked a pout.\n\nAndrew jumped to his feet and kicked the boy in the face before throwing the front door open and running into the night. The boy held his head swung back and cackled.\n\nHe brushed his pants off as he stood up and turned towards the door. Fresh rage rose from my chest and lit my cheeks on fire. I shot up and reached out to grab him and yank him back in. To make him pay for ruining my friend’s perfect night. “Hey assh-” as my hand gripped his face, my words were stolen from me. My eyes rolled like the reels on a slot machine.\n\nI wasn’t in the musty house anymore. I was standing at the front iron gates of a graveyard, the boy next to me, a proud smile plastered across his face. Inside, hundreds of people danced in their Sunday’s best. Some danced jerkily like marionettes whose strings were being pulled by an inexperienced puppeteer. Others twirled like the ballerina in my mother’s antique jewelry box. As I moved deeper in, they paid me no mind.\n\nI cautiously walked closer to a well-dressed man with a long mustache. I counted 8 bullet holes across his face. He was quietly humming under his breath as he jerked. I glanced down at his feet encapsulated in concrete blocks and knees bent backwards.\n\nI took a few steps back before bumping into a woman with cropped dark hair. She twirled effortlessly with both arms raised high above her head. Worms occasionally fell from her empty eye sockets. The hanging flesh from the slash in her throat bellowed softly as she spun, like lace curtains in a gentle breeze.\n\nOn and on they danced.\n\n*They’re dead. They’re all dead.* The thought brought a buzzing to my ears, my vision wavering as I frantically looked from corpse to corpse.\n\n“Malorie wanted to know my name, do you?” the boy asked, still beside me. “My name is Death, Alex. And in time, I come for everyone. Young men, old women, and children, I come for them all. Your friend Andrew is coming with me tonight, he’s coming to dance. Go home, or you’ll see me again sooner than you may wish.”\n\nThe low hum that rumbled through the purple night sky rose to a murmur, and then a roar. All at once, every person in the graveyard dropped their jaws and screamed. Their eternal dancing never stopped or slowed.\n\nI shoved my fingers in both ears, crouched down, ducked my head between my knees, and screamed with them.\n\nSomeone shook me hard enough I lost my balance and fell into the fetal position on the hard floor. A girl’s voice screamed my name. As I slowly opened my eyes, I saw Abby’s face above me.\n\nI scrambled to my feet, sucking in air like a man rescued from an angry sea. The boy laughed from the doorway.\n\n“Well, as you’ve seen Alex, I have somewhere I’d desperately like to get back to, but I have business to attend to first.” He turned his dark eyes to Abby, “See you next year.” He pulled the hood of his pullover down and walked casually into the night.\n\nChaos broke out in the house behind me but I just ran home. I laid in bed all night sobbing.\n\nIn the morning, screaming from outside pulled me from my bed.\n\nAcross the street, Andrew’s mother was being held back by her husband as she wailed and reached towards a stretcher with a black body bag on top, “My son! My beautiful boy! Bring him back! He’s okay, he’s okay, please just let me see my boy!” She eyed me standing at the edge of my driveway watching. “Did you know? Tell me you didn’t know! Tell me you didn’t know what he was going to do to himself!”\n\nI didn’t answer, I just turned around and went back inside.\n\nRumors about a note flew through the school.\n\n*“All I needed was just one good night.”*\n\nAndrew’s suicide drove us all apart. Or maybe it was the boy. We didn’t even smile if we caught each other’s eyes in passing in the hallways. Although I was the only one who’d seen it, I think deep inside, all of us had one foot in that graveyard, desperate to dance.\n\nGrieving Andrew without Kyle was the hardest part. But eventually we all made new friends. We slowly began to move on. Separately. \n\nOur self-imposed distance didn’t stop the news of Abby’s death from reaching each of us.\n\nA year exactly from the night of Andrew’s suicide, Abby had gone to a house party. Dan Harper’s dad was the officer on duty that night. \n\nAccording to Dan, his dad had told him Abby had drank too much at the party and called her mother to come get her. Abby’s mom, thinking Abby had plans to stay at a friend’s house overnight, had dipped harder into her bourbon bottle than usual. Nonetheless, she couldn’t bear to leave her daughter in a place she thought was unsafe. So, she went and picked her up. The irony of her mother’s drunk driving to “rescue” her daughter wasn’t missed.\n\nWith a light fog glittering against her headlights, Abby’s mom plowed the car into the same oak tree she passed while heading to work five days a week. Dan’s dad said there were no skid marks, so either Abby’s mom hadn’t seen it, or she’d fallen asleep behind the wheel. Abby’s mom survived. Abby didn’t. I wonder whether Death sat beside her in the car as it collided with the tree, or whether he collected her after.\n\nI inhaled deeply on my Marlboro, letting the smoke twirl and rake its hot claws across my lungs. I tossed it on the ground, stomped on it, and threw my half empty pack into the street as I walked to see what had become of the house we’d all been in just over a year ago. I wonder if I’ll have an unexpected visitor. I have so many questions for him.\n\nI think I’m finally done smoking.",

        "text": "As the title says, I haven’t spoken in 2 years.\n\nMy husband,Friends,Doctors they’ve tried everything yet I still won’t say a word. If I say something…anything. It’ll all erupt again. \n\nExactly two years ago to this day I rolled out of bed as a slight spring breeze floated through the bedroom scented lightly of fresh grass and with a warmth that filled my soul with happiness. Going into the kitchen I hugged my husband, drank my coffee and set off on my bike as I usually do, filling my little Whicker basket with my usual stuff, I still cherish the last “I love you” I shouted as I hurried out…I wish I’d slowed down,appreciated it more. \n\nAs I biked to my favourite field to sit under my favourite oak tree ready to spend my day sketching the scenes around me and watching the clouds carry the day away I heard a scream, a scream so vile and raw that it felt like I’d been hit over the head with a brick. I stopped riding immediately, got off my bike and ran to see what it was…a young girl. Not much younger than myself she must have been around 20. She had been stabbed, mutilated but was still alive, still screaming, her face was contented and swollen barely human, her hair clumped with leaves and twigs and mud covering her once bright blonde locks. \n\n I panicked I tried everything to keep her quiet and calm, I kept shushing her and I tried to hold her hand, she just wouldn’t stop screaming. I patted myself down for my phone in my panic…I’d left it at home. She screamed and screamed and screamed and  the feeling just built up and I couldn’t hear myself think. The next thing I knew I was screaming too, “shut up, SHUT UP,SHUT UP” Iv never done well under pressure. She didn’t shut up. \n\nThe more I screamed the more she did too, this macabre symphony of pure anguish, pain and frustration. I can’t set her free I can’t help her. What was I meant to do? I had nothing else to do…Iv always been a good person, I am a good person. \n\nSuddenly it hit me, when a bug, a bird or something is hurt you’re meant to put it out of its misery, right? She was dying. Surly. I was just freeing her from this pain. I didn’t have my phone, I didn’t know what to do we were in the middle of nowhere, the next thing I know I’m throwing all my weight down with a rock in my hand, she screams more, begging. I can’t take it anymore and all I can scream is “I’m a good person. I’m a good person,I’m helping you. I’m a good person” soon she stopped moving and as I stumbled back towards where my bike was I remembered…I always keep my phone in the little Whicker basket on my bike incase of emergencies. I really don’t work well under pressure. \n\nI haven’t spoken in two years. If I do they might realise I’m the one who called her family after finishing her off.",

        "text": "Since I only told you about things that happened in the past in my last two posts, here's an update on what's currently going on. Yesterday, Casimir found a YouTube channel with a bunch of videos that are very obviously footage from my woods. There's a clip of a gaggle of rusalki, that gross-ass two-headed bear that sometimes eats my trash and even the Leshy stalking by. My brother is working on somehow taking them down. Meanwhile, I've been trying to find out where Jacek lives these days.\n\nI guess I could try and find another occultist, but I need someone reliable, and as much as I hate the thought of having to see him again, I know he's the only one I can trust.\n\nThat's why I've been scouring social media once again, trying to find a trace of him. I went into this expecting not to come up with anything, but it seems that digitalization has reached even my ex. I found him on an obscure forum discussing black magic (because of course that's where he'd be). I wasn't sure it was him at first, but the username *CaptainHyacinth* kind of piqued my interest. He wrote the way he'd used to speak, his boyish humor always swinging along while still seeming more savvy than anyone else. He also claimed to be in the direct employ of the Devil, so that checked out as well. The more I clicked through his post history, the more certain I became. \n\nEventually, I decided to just create an account under the name of *YourForestWife* and shoot him a DM. With shaking fingers, I started typing. \n\n*\"Jacek Hettmann?\"*\n\nThe reply came surprisingly fast.\n\n**\"Wtf, who is this?\"**\n\n*\"Fiona Novak. Any chance you remember me? Sorry for reaching out like this. I know it's been a long time and I get it if you don't want to talk to me. But hear me out, please?\"*\n\nMaybe that had been too direct. I waited for him to text back for about five minutes, but nothing came. My heart was beating kind of quickly. I needed to get away from that screen.\n\n\"Cas, how's it going?\" I called out, hurrying over to my brother who was scrolling on his laptop.\n\n\"Pretty good,\" he muttered, not looking up. \"No one believes these videos are real anyways. I don't think we need to worry about them.\"\n\n\"I found Jacek.\"\n\nCasimir whipped his head up. \"No shit. For real?\"\n\nI nodded. \"Texted him. He's not answering, though.\"\n\n\"Oh, he will. Give him some time.\"\n\n\"We don't have any time! And how are you so sure?\"\n\nHe shrugged. \"I just know. You were his first girl. You don't forget someone like that.\"\n\nI frowned. \"Do *you* remember your first girlfriend?\"\n\nMy brother laughed. \"Oh, hell no.\"\n\nFeeling a distinct need for fresh air, I headed outside. Maybe I was just going to have myself an outdoor day. A thick blanket of glittering snow was covering the red meadow as I stride across it, each step accompanied by a satisfying crunch. I hadn't taken a walk like that for a while. Just movement for me to relax, not to seek out some abandoned building or dump a body. I knew I couldn't run from my problems, but I wasn't running; I was only taking a break. I stopped to chat with Gus for a minute before proceeding into the frost-laden thicket. \n\nThe wildlife in my forest—the *actual* wildlife—keeps mostly to itself. I already mentioned that there aren't any birds anymore, so any chirping you might hear in these parts means trouble. All the actual animals mostly stay in hiding due to the amount of superior predators around. There's the occasional rabbit or deer you might come across, as well as some squirrels and other smaller critters.\n\nSuddenly, the relative quiet and serenity was disturbed by a loud, drawn-out scream that immediately stopped me in my tracks. It sounded like an animal, an actual animal—in fact, I was pretty sure it was a deer. Now, a deer getting caught and gutted by one of the lake people or the forest spirits was no rare occurrence. Something was wrong about that cry, though. It wasn't like a dying bleat, it somehow sounded furious. I wasn't armed, but I started heading towards it anyways, figuring I'd just be sneaky. Ducking from bush to bush, I made my way over to where the noises had come from. \n\nI found it on a small clearing—a young buck, hopping around like he'd gone mad. It was a deeply unsettling sight, seeing it bash its head into the same tree trunk over and over again. I swore I could already hear his skull crack. Still, it started standing, throwing back its head as if it was trying to break its own neck. I felt like I was about to vomit. I could sense that I was witnessing something innately wrong, something beyond unholy. I thought feverishly; I had to step in somehow. I didn't want this tormented creature to die in such a way. But try as I might, I could not come up with anything. I would have to make a run for it and tell Casimir. He'd know what to do, and if not, he was still a good enough shot to give the buck a mercy killing from a safe distance. Maybe afterwards, we could examine it.\n\nThe buck had something quite different in mind, though. \n\nBefore I had even moved an inch, it had already spotted me behind the tree trunk where I'd been hiding. I could swear I hadn't made a single sound, but no matter how, the damned thing had its sights set on me now. \n\nI let out a startled shriek as it charged me, only managing to dodge by a hair's width. Now that it was closer, I noticed that there was something wrong with the buck's eyes. Those weren't the full, peaceful brown eyes of a deer. They were jittery, darting from side, and worse yet—they looked distinctly human. I couldn't believe what I was looking at. I kept on ducking and jumping as the freak deer took leap after leap towards me, unable to stifle the cries spilling from my lips. I tried to go back the direction I'd come from, but it was hard making progress with how this beast was chasing me. There was no doubt in my mind that it was attempting to kill me, and it was getting closer to reaching its goal every time it came at me. \n\nI realized in horror that I was starting to tire out. I wouldn't last at this rate. The deer got close again, close enough for me to feel its hot breath on my face. Just as my mind was starting to wrap around the prospect of meeting my death on a forest walk of all things, something came crashing down on the frenzied deer. Blood spattered, hitting my skirt. At first, I thought it was a falling tree, only to realize that it was a much more animate being. The Leshy, having thrown himself into the buck with the full weight of his own enormous body, slowly drew himself back up, revealing the crushed carcass beneath him. \n\n*\"That would be the second time I've ruined a gown of yours, heiress,\"* he growled out, clearly relishing the stunned panic in my wide eyes.\n\nStill frozen in shock and bewilderment, I watched as a strange gray cloud rose from the cadaver, quickly dissipating. \"What the hell was that?\" I sighed, shoulders dropping as I allowed myself to relax and catch my breath.\n\n*\"Bies,\"* the Leshy grunted.\n\nI squinted. \"Sorry, I didn't quite catch that?\"\n\n*\"None of your concern. Stick to your task, wench.\"*\n\n\"Hold up! You know something.\" I instantly regretted my demanding tone when the enormous creature turned back to face me, bringing his snout dangerously close to my face. The Leshy's heated breath rose up into the air in cloudy puffs, and I held his glowing gaze for a moment that terrified me just as much as the encounter with the mad buck had. He didn't say a word. My unease mounting in the silence, I ended up averting my eyes, swallowing audibly as I took a step back. \"I'm sorry, Sir.\"\n\n*\"Run along before I forget myself.\"*\n\nNow, I am a fully-grown woman, but the Lord of the woods could make me piss my pants anytime. I was therefore all too eager to obey, only daring to slow my step when I was sure the distance between us was sufficient. \n\nThere was obviously something the Leshy wasn't telling me. That in itself wasn't much of a surprise, but I could tell that this was different. Whatever had happened to the deer, it had seemed to worry the wood-demon, if indeed he was capable of feeling such an emotion. He sure had been reluctant to speak up about it, and seeing as he normally can't get enough of his own voice, that made things rather strange.\n\nI came across Fergus again on my way back and cadged some coffee from his thermos. He could tell something was up, but had the grace not to ask. \n\n\"Say, how long has it been since you've been working for us? I swear you were already here when my mother was still alive,\" I remarked, sipping from his cup.\n\n\"Oh yeah,\" he said, smacking his lips. \"It's been a while.\"\n\n\"I'm glad you're still around,\" I told him earnestly.\n\n\"Long as you don't think I'm getting too old for the job,\" Gus laughed and I snorted.\n\n\"Bullshit. How old even are you, like, barely forty, right?\"\n\n\"I'm fifty-seven, you liar,\" he said affectionately. \n\n\"Not to put any pressure on you, but just so you know, you're going to be missed around here when you leave us.\"\n\n\"I should hope so. But don't worry, I'm not quite done yet. This was my first job, and it's gonna be my last.\"\n\n\"Don't say that, the forest might misunderstand you.\"\n\n\"Oops.\" He covered his mouth with his palm. \"Wouldn't want that.\"\n\nWhen I got back home, I tried to set my mind on the task at hand again. Whatever had happened out there probably had nothing to do with all of this. It had only been the usual forest strangeness, I had almost died again, nothing out of the ordinary. I'm living on borrowed time over here anyways. Still, when I laid eyes on my computer, my stomach immediately dropped again. \n\nI needed to know if Jacek had responded, but I didn't want to check. *Why was this freaking me out so much?* I willed myself to sit down in front of the black screen. \n\n*Come on, come on, come on…*\n\nI turned it on, and several messages sprung up. My breath caught in my throat, I was almost too nervous to take in the words. Jacek had, in fact, answered me. Four times, in total.\n\nThe first message had been deleted. The three that followed lifted a weight off my shoulders, though. \n\n**\"Ignore the one above. I was just really surprised so I said something stupid. So, to what do I owe the honor? You need something, don't you?\"**\n\n**\"Okay, scratch that. How are you doing?\"**\n\n**\"I'm sorry, I'm really trying not to sound catty.\"**\n\nI let go of a deep breath, bracing myself. *\"Did you cuss me out at first? You totally did, didn't you?\"*\n\nThe response popped up immediately. **\"Not really. I was just being dumb.\"**\n\n*\"Good news for you, though, I'm doing crappy. I'm just gonna go out on a limb here and assume you're still practicing magic?\"*\n\nHe didn't send an actual answer, just this one emoji with the sunglasses on.\n\n*\"I definitely need your help. I'll pay you, too.\"*\n\n**\"Help as in advice or I gotta be there?\"**\n\n*\"You'd probably have to be here.\"*\n\nRadio silence. I bit my lip. *\"I totally get it if you can't,\"* I added. *\"Or if you don't want to.\"*\n\n**\"Okay.\"**\n\nThe text arrived at the same time I sent off mine.\n\n**\"I'm coming. I'll hurry; think I can be there in a day. Call me if something goes very wrong in the meantime.\"** Beneath the text was a phone number.\n\nSo I guess now, I'll hold still until Jacek gets here. I'm nervous and I don't know why. I know he's going to help me—he'll expect compensation but that's okay, it'll be well-worth the money. In the meantime, I'm going to try and look up what a Bies is. I'm starting to have a feeling that I shouldn't take this lightly. \n\n\n[X](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrypticPark?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)\n\n[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/zy4auu/to_all_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_stay_the_fuck/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/zyzp01/a_warning_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_yuletide/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/100lj37/a_warning_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_i_found/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[Part 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/101n4rg/a_warning_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_my/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[Part 5](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/102jqcy/a_warning_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_theres/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[Part 6](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/103yryr/a_warning_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[Part 7](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/105nlp7/a_warning_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_some/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[Part 8](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1071bxu/warnings_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_jacek_of/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n[Part 9](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1085qzf/warnings_to_the_wannabe_cryptid_hunters_heres_why/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)",

        "text": "The pandemic had hit quite hard on me as I had lost my job working at the local shops and having the store having to lay off 30% of their staff I was one of the unlucky few picked. I wasn't lucky finding any jobs as most had closed or where families that were not willing to take on a 20 old drop out student who never finished. I survived by doing unsavory entertainment for business men and strangers. I don't enjoy it so I won't talk about  its nsavery work and it doesn't pay well.\n\nBesides, there's no harm living with your mother for a bit. How long can this pandemic be, like what 3 months at least I'll be able to find a better job. I thought to myself. Boy was I wrong. A year into the pandemic and money was getting very thin and food prices were through the roof. Some day my mother and I only had bread and butter to eat.\n\nNot to mention my mother's declining health and chemo made it more harder. The pills she needed were quite expensive and most of our money was going towards it but as of lately we couldn't even afford paying for those. \n\nNow you're wondering when do I start my night shift and the factory. Well while I was prowling the streets looking for potential customers I came across a man standing alone under a street lamp. \n\nNow I know people are gonna say don't do that you're gonna get yourself killed but I needed money and I was desperate. I walked up to the man and I gave him a gentle tap. The Stranger turned around and looked at me with the coldest stare I've ever seen. He then spoke in a gentle but gruff tone.\n\n\"Is there anything I can help you with ma'am\"\n\n\"I am looking for some work and wondering if you liked to go behind that alley and I'll show you a good time\" I replied hesitantly. You never know what customers you're gonna deal with. I ran into a few bad apples and was hospitalized but that's a story for another time.\n\nHe looked up and down at me then sighed. \n\n\"No ma'am I'm not interested tonight\"\n\n\"Please sir I need the money my mother is in dire need of treatment and\"...\n\nHe cut me off. \n\n\"Look ma'am I'm not interested but I can offer you a job working for me\"\n\nI was shocked, it's been nearly two years since I applied for jobs so naturally I accepted.\n\nWhat's the job? I enquired\n\nHe looked at me and gave me a note. Now these should have raised even more red flags but I didn't care, I finally had an opportunity to earn decent money and afford medication for my mother. After he handed me the note I looked and gasped $40 an hour 12 hour shifts from 5pm to 5am.\n\n\"Sir are you pulling my leg; I bolted up with excitement not evening trying to contain the excitement. He looked at me.\n\n\"You start tomorrow, don't be late. Everything will be covered on orientation so please don't ask and save them for tomorrow\".\n\n\"Yes sir I\" said while walking off.\n\nWhat a lucky night I thought to myself mother would be so pleased. I got home around midnight not making any money but hey you can't blame a girl who got offered a once in a lifetime opportunity and be distracted. I got home and announced to my mother that I got hired by a company. She was a little skeptical at first.\n\n\"Do you know what company you're working for dear?\" My mother enquired.\n\n\"He said don't ask if everything will be explained tomorrow\". I shot back\n\nMother gave me the coldest stare like I've made the dumbest decision of my life, couldn't blame her I wasn't the brightest when coming to big decisions like these, she always said I went ahead first.\n\n\"But mum, we can finally live comfortably and pay for your medications\". I retorted.\n\nMother didn't reply as she had collapsed and was asleep. The cancer had taken a lot from her and had badly any energy to do most menial things. I kissed mother on the forehead and turned off the lights. \n\n\"Tomorrow everything's gonna change for the best.\" I whispered while closing the door. The next day came across and I ran down to greet my mother who was sitting on the couch watching the tv. Mother, I'm off to work. She lifted a finger to indicate she heard me.\n\nAs I opened the door I was greeted with a black Sudan waiting for me on the Parkway.Strangely, I walked up to the car and the dark tinted windows rolled down and I was greeted  by the man I met last night.\n\n\"Um hello\" I asked shakely.\n\n\"Hello miss Alex please get there was a slight change so Im picking you up if that's all right\". He replied.\n\n\"How did you find my address and also how did you know my name\"?\n \n\"Please get in, all questions when we get to the warehouse\". As he waved me in.\n\nNow being a bit skeptical I hopped into the car and we drove off. We passed houses and streets that I've never seen before and street names I couldn't even pronounce. I looked at the man and wondered if I had made a horrible choice in accepting this job offer. I sat in silent dozing off when suddenly the car jerked to a screeching stop.\n\n\"Where here the man\" pronounced with a grumpy and tired tone.\n\nI got out of the car and looked around my surroundings. It looked like you're ordinary. Mega warehouse. But the oddest thing was that there was now company logo anywhere to be seen.\n\n\"Follow me please,\" the man asked. \n\"You'll be working alongside Abby who takes over after you completed your shift but for now she'll be working with you to catch you up on how things work here\".\n\nHe led me up a flight of stairs where I was greeted by an energetic and outgoing young woman around my age.\n\n\"Hi you must be the new guard I'm Abby I'll be going through basic trading and wait to watch for\"\n\nI nodded in  agreement. The man had already left us and was long gone.\n\n\"Perfect, do you know the basics on how a gun works Alex?\" Abby asked.\n \nI nodded again\n\"Well good you gotta know the things out there are very territorial and dangerous down there.\"\n\nI looked at her in confusion. She must have guessed by the expression on my face.\n\nThe mannequins. They are very territorial about the area and hate any intruders. \n\nI looked puzzled trying to comprehend what Abby said about mannequins coming to life. Great, I couldn't believe her even if I tried. Mannequins that are alive that's ridiculous. So I asked what happens if they get you.\n\nShe shot me a look and gestured to follow her down to the floor level. Once we got down there I saw rows and rows of mannequin all lined up in semicircles. \n\n\"It makes it easier to patrol the area like that,\" she said.\n\n\"How many mannequins are there\"  I asked curious because the whole floor was covered in the creepy plastic things\n\n\"2000 mannequins,\" she replied.\n\nI quaked at that answer. She fumbled in her pockets and pulled out a keychain and found the correct keys. She opened the door to a dark room and she flicked the switch. I felt shivers run down my spine as I saw from across the room a mannequin that looked exactly like me just sitting in the fetal position. I panicked a bit at the uncanny resemblance it had on me but held it in.\n\n\"Um Abby, why is that mannequin locked up?\" I answered puzzled. \n\nAbby replied by bringing out a flashlight and turning the lights off and shining a light on the mannequin. I liked back in shock seeing the mannequin had glowing purple lines where the joints are and bright purple mixed with blue and red tribal paint on its face with a gray line around the breast painted like zig zags and black running down the inner thighs and and chest.\n\n\"What the hell?! I exclaimed\n\"What are they as i said\" trying to get a closer look. I got closer to the glass and as soon as my hand touched the glass the mannequin peered its head up and gave me a grin. I jumped back, tripping over my foot and landing with a loud thump on my arse. \n\n\"What the hell Abby, what is that?\" I protested in fear.\n\n\"Those are the things we're going to have to look out for or…\" \n\"They are somehow easier to spot with a black light but under normal light it's near impossible to tell the difference between them.\"\n\n\"Or what?\"\n\nShe shows me another cage. This time stood a disassembled mannequin on the floor. Body parts flayed around the room.\n\n\"Or you end up like him\"\n\n\"Who I \"asked \n\n\"Andrew, he got jumped by them and well you see what they can do\".  Never let them surround you and always have your pistol ready\".\n\nI looked at Abby and back at Andrew. What have I gotten myself into?\" I thought to myself. We exited the room and went back to the office. Abby sat down and asked any questions. I asked how to take them down and she replied that a shot or hard hit towards the head or chest does the trick. I nodded and I asked how many are usually down there. And like clockwork she replied.\n\n\"Usually we deal with one or two, at most a bit unlucky Andrew dealt with 7 and he got jumped.\"\n\nI looked at Abby and down at the floor contplanting she noticed my expression. And gave a reading nod that I can handle this. I half smiled back at her not shaking the uncanny feeling of me seeing that mannequin looking just like me. That thing creeped me out the most. Will I turn into one of those if I'm not careful. I kept those thoughts to myself and asked. \n\n\"How often do I need to do a perimeter check?\"\n\n\"She replied once every two hours so six times during your shift\".\n\nAbby got up from her chair and headed towards some lockers where she pulled out a flashlight and a pistol and handed them towards me As Well as a radio.\n\n\"Since tonight is your first shift I'll help you out and guide you\" she smiled.\n\nWe both got up and headed for our rounds around the wherehouse Shing our torches at the mannequins when Abby grabbed my hand and told me to send. Her hands felt off but I ignored it.  She said do you hear that we both stayed still and then we heard a scuttling noise coming from  down the aisle we are in. Abby quickly switched her black light on and the room was illuminated by a dark purple hue. \n\nWe scanned the mannequins when the lights shine onto one its bright patterns had been revealed and suddenly as à animal that has been caught in mid action it lept towards Abby bearing its claws out. Abby quickly got out and shot the thing in the head.The mannequin's head landed with a thump and its body fell apart. I looked shocked.\n\nWhen suddenly we heard more scuttling coming from Further down. \n\n'Your turn' Abby proclaimed\n\nI quickly got my light and gun ready when suddenly the scuttling got  closer and I looked behind me to a female mannequin right behind me. I panicked and dropped my light causing it to be dark. I ducked under the table that was close by and in a few seconds I heard gunshots and then this. Abby had taken out the female mannequin. Abby found me under the table huddled into a ball and laughed .\n\n'Don't worry I was a nervous wreck.\nOn my first day you get used to this, trust me.'\n\nAs she spoke to me I noticed that her eyes were glazy and dark thinking it was a trick of the eye. I nodded and got my flashlight and we finished the rest of the patrol. Since it was my first day I was told many things about this place and what they do during the day. When finally home time came I packed my things and waved Abby goodbye.\n\nWhen I walked out the door I was greeted by the man who picked me up in his black sedan. He looked at me and gusseted for me to go in. I hoped In and we drove off towards my house.\n\n \"Hey, I never got your \nname.\"\n \n \"Ivan replied\".\n\n\"Well nice to meet you Ivan and thank you\" I replied.\n\nSoon I dozed off into a sleep and next minute I was home I got out and thanked Ivan for the lift and he waved goodbye. As soon as I entered the house I got a message from an unknown number. It read as tomorrow pick up at 5pm please wait outside 10 minutes before.I looked up thinking it was Ivan. I looked at the time best. I better get to bed, I thought.\n\nThe following five weeks went without incident. I got better at detecting those creatures and Abby was proud of the improvement. The money I received helped my mother substantially   and her health was improving. \n\nThose all changed however on my 20th week working alone. The day started as  picked up by Ivan and as I headed towards our place I fell asleep once again on the way there. I headed towards the building and got up and saw Abby there. Apparently she told me there was a recent spike in creature sightings and worried she wanted to help me. I gladly nodded. Not question the legitimacy but hey great company would be nice it gets lonely.\n\nWe headed towards the locked and Abby handed me my flashlight and pistol and waited for our first grounds of patrol. As the hour got closer we prepared our gear and headed down to the floor. We headed down and Abby suggested we split up and take tow aisle to get more ground quickly. I agreed, we split going down our separate aisle.\n\nAs I was about to finish my aisle I heard a scuttling noise. I looked around and saw nothing when my light started to flicker. Panicking, I gave it the old age trick of hitting until it worked. Eventually it shone again. And as I faced it up I screamed in absolute terror as one of the mannequin was only ten feet away from me. \n\nI shone the black light at it, sighing in relief that it was only a normal mannequin. But the oddest thing is that it looked so much like Abby. I crept closer to the Abby look alike when suddenly it turned its head and started a full on sprint at me. Panicking, I grabbed my pistol and fired a few shots at it..\n\nFuck I know I got that thing then I realised that the bullets I. My pistol where all blanks fearing for my life I threw the postal at the Abby mannequin and bolted towards the stairs but as I got near them 22 other mannequin were blocking my path. I heard maniacal laughter and turned around to see Abbey look alike a mannequin staring at me. I shone my blacklight at her with revealed fiery red markings adorn her body and maori markings on her back. \n\nShe pointed a finger and 4 of the other mannequin jumped on me with the click of her finger they tore my clothes off leaving me bare. I yelled out to her to stop but she just smiled. I heard a strange noise which sounded like plastic rubbing against plastic. I looked down to see my legs were turning to plastic and they let me go and I fell to the ground.  Saw the plastic creeping up towards me.\n\nMy hands got stiff and I couldn't move. Abby then ordered them to throw me into the cage with the other mannequin but somehow it managed to run past us and escape. She then closed the gates and ordered the mannequin to leave. I sat stuck in my position for god knows how long until I learnt to move my joints. It took me a while to learn how to move my fave but eventually I could walk. \n\nI must escape, I thought to myself. I heard chatter and noise coming towards the door and I decided to sit down onto the fetal position and when I looked up I saw myself staying at me I smiled and she flew backwards and tripped. Realizing this was a loop I planned my escape. And waited in the dark room for almost 3 months when I heard the room doors opening and Abby alongside 4 other mannequins with my plastic body by their side. When I heard the cage unlock I bolted for the exit and toward the staff room where I found this computer I'm typing on.\n\nI don't know how long I have heard them banging at the door. So here's my warning: don't ever take the offer of being a night guard at this warehouse or you will end up with a date similar to mine or worse.",

        "text": "My friend Marcus had always been fond of indoor plants. He saw them as tokens of purification - in a way, harbouring such soothing lifeforms betters oneself in some ways. It's like being a parent to a benevolent entity that provides you with the stuff you need to survive. They also look good. This was apparent to me every time I went into Marcus' bedroom every now and then, and from the roof to the floor, there was a cascade of plants. You name it, it was probably there—the dangly ones and the pointy ones and the ones that look more like abstract objects than plants.\n\nIt was only natural for me to adopt this love for plants and I quickly accepted Marcus' offer to give me three new plants. A large one in a plastic pot, forgive me for not knowing the names, a dark green one with maroon leaves, and a little bright one with white nodes. \n\n'Are you sure you want to give these to me?' I asked him courteously.\n\n'Of course! I want my *best* friend to love plants, like me.' he responded enthusiastically. \n\nHis plump lips were oddly large for his face, so it felt like a cartoon was speaking to me. However, he had a flair to him. Being around him was enchanting, as it felt as though he had so many aspects of his life together. In some way, it felt like he was more than human. \n\nI had a feeling that he only said the 'best friend' part because I was the only one in the friend group who became interested in his plants. Kylie and Jack, the two others in the group, had made their disdain for his plants very clear. Although it's only little remarks, like using 'plant lover' or 'tree humper' in a derogatory way, it's so frequently said that the image is overt. \n\nThe plants fit snugly in my bedroom. Two of them, the smaller ones, sat on either side of my desk. The large one stood over my bedside table, sheltering the books and the many trinkets that sat underneath it. They looked great and completed the refined look my room needed. As I drifted off to bed that night, in the single room upstairs - the rest of the bedrooms were downstairs, my sister's and my parents' - I spoke to the large plant on my bedside table.\n\n'It's nice to meet you.' I whispered to it. \n\nThe following week was the normal last-year-of-high-school experience. Avoiding the people who spoke of me with disgust and latching to the friend group. I was the joke of the week to Kylie and Jack, who found out about my recent plant ownership when Marcus questioned me about how I was caring for them. \n\n'Oh my god, you actually got plants? Are you some sort of hippie now?' they'd taunt. \n\nIt was the day that Marcus didn't show up to school that they stopped taunting me. Right in the middle of a usual badmouthing of him from the two others, the teacher announced his unfortunate passing.\n\n'I will not disclose the cause of death, but it was not by external influence.' Mrs Deakins echoed. \n\nYou would have thought in a high school setting the unleashing of such information would lead to pandemonium, but everyone was silent. Mrs Deakins didn't even speak, she was glued to her laptop for the rest of the period. Nobody cried. It was just a battle with denial. \n\nI spoke with Marcus' mother often in the next few days, consoling each other as we both descended into the further stages of grief. She told me that he died of a seizure during his sleep, and that it was not a result of an undiagnosed disease or some sort of anomaly, the pathologists could not find the reason for the seizure. I felt as though I didn't really care for how he died, but for the gaping absence he left behind. \n\nWhat filled that absence were little flies. I kept Marcus' plants in my room because I felt as though they were contributing to his memory, and to remove his plants was to remove him from my life, so when I sat at my desk and every so often there was a little fly, I ignored it. I used to catch them under the grooves of my fingertip and crush them in hopes of them not returning. When they became an issue, I used the internet to find a remedy.\n\nThe result I stuck with was that they were fungus gnats. They live in the soil and lay eggs there, so it can be difficult to get rid of them. Google said that they were there due to the fact that the plants were overwatered, which I doubted, but it was the most reasonable explanation. \n\nWith a watered down solution, I gave my plants a few spritzes. That was all.\n\n'Do you still have your plants?' Kylie asked me condescendingly.\n\n'Of course I do.' I responded honestly.\n\n'Of course you do.' she replied with a false tone of admiration. \n\n'Is there a problem?'\n\n'Not at all.'\n\nThe two of us adjusted our aggressive postures and retreated to a normal position, upright and not near each-other. She turned to me as if she were fighting a little voice in her head telling her to let it go.\n\n'I just don't like you.' she commented.\n\n'And why's that?' I respond, not in the mood to end this conversation. One thing Marcus' death left with me was a sense of not tolerating people who treat me poorly.\n\n'I just get the sense you like it when anyone suffers. Or anything, for that matter. You probably torture puppies or something.'\n\nJack was equally as hostile. He didn't remark that I'm some sort of weirdo who enjoys the pain of others - or animals - but he showed the same level of disapproval towards me. The kind of disapproval that he and Kylie gave Marcus. I wondered what I had done so cruel to deserve this kind of attention. \n\nThat night, homework was flavoured with an onset of fatigue. The words on the bright screen of my computer were all garbled in my head when I read them, and the numbers looked more like symbols. In my drowsy state, I thought nothing of the little fly on my hand that I instinctively slapped to death. My eyes traced the pot holding the what-once-was a light colored plant (but was now a deep brown) and spotted the many flies crawling around the side and the mouth of the pot. I tapped the side of the plant and a few of them jumped out and back in. I clutched the side of the pot and waved it a bit, and it spat out a lot more. They were everywhere. On my desk, on all of my books, and my hands. I swatted them all away and killed as many as I could before inevitably slumping into a deep sleep. \n\nI was a pariah the next day at school. Everybody there looked at me as if I were a mass of slime and smell, and nobody dared speak to me. My locker was adorned with bright vulgar words, and somebody had slipped a little noose into it through the cracks in the locker-door. I knew that I was deeply disliked when nobody even called anything out to me in public. Everybody just let their harsh feelings sink in and ooze into the halls for all of the others to pick up and accumulate into this massive bundle of hate. \n\nAll of my teachers refused to let me into their classes. I was not allowed to go home either, as the head of the school was itching to slam me down for truancy. \n\nI came home and there were no traces of flies. None in the plants, nor furtively creeping across my room. All gone. I knew this was bad. \n\nI remembered that Marcus, before his demise, was treated somewhat similarly to the first day of school I had after the flies got worse. I also remember Katie's words to me, \"*I just get the sense you like it when anyone suffers. Or anything, for that matter.\"* The flies are to blame for my suffering. \n\nI sat before my brown plant and prayed to it. I spoke highly of the flies, and invited them back. I apologised for the many I killed, and that I hope there is anything I could do for forgiveness. I know that it's ridiculous that I was talking to a bunch of invisible flies, but within the current circumstances, I don't think that it was inappropriate to try.\n\nWhen I woke up the next morning, the walls of my room, scarcely on my desk and entirely on my bed, were covered in black patches. In my morning drunkenness, I had naturally assumed that the house burned down overnight, but as my mind adjusted to the present, I realised that the black patches were clusters of flies. Crawling and hissing, the little flutters of every wing of every fly were deafening. They were on me. Under my shirt, in my underwear, and in my ears and my nose. I rubbed my eye and felt one underneath my eyelid. I reached for my doorknob after throwing myself off of the bed, and then I heard it breathing. Human breathing, beating and warm. \n\nI turned around, and the flies beside me had created a large mass, stretching out from the wall. They had made a life-sized replica of Marcus with themselves. His skin was coarse with the texture of a million flies. \n\nI am now in a hotel room somewhere in the countryside. I feel as though I am being watched, and that the flies are not done with me yet. However, I will never give myself up to the flies. I will hide in this room for as long as I possibly can if I have to. I will not give in to them and let them do what they did to Marcus. I have not seen a single fly yet, but I am sure it's meant to be daytime as my phone says that it's 1 PM, but no light is coming out of my window. Or the little glass pane in the door. I get a text.\n\nFrom *Marcus*.\n\n\"Come outside.\"",

        "text": "We found Sadie when she was about a year old. At least, that was our veterinarian’s best guess. She had wandered out of the forest at the edge of our property, her tail wagging furiously. I whistled at her once and she came right over. I gave her a bowl of water and some scraps of meat from our last meal, and before I knew it she was curled up between me and my wife in our bed. We did our due diligence to make sure no one was looking for her. We took her to the shelter to check for a microchip, we put up flyers around town, and we posted on every “lost pet” website we could find. When it became clear that she had been on her own, we decided to officially welcome her to the family. It didn’t take much convincing.\n\nSadie was a happily anxious dog - the type that would excitedly roll over and pee on herself when meeting another creature. You could tell she liked the idea of being protective, but she wasn’t very good at it. She was always on high alert when we had visitors after dark, but she wasn’t exactly the type of dog to scare away any potential dangers.\n\nSince we lived on the edge of a small town, I never had any strong reservations about letting Sadie enjoy a free-range life. On most mornings, she would eat her breakfast, excuse herself to the forest, and return when the setting sun or her appetite told her it was time to come home for dinner. In retrospect, it probably wasn’t a good idea; there were coyotes, copperheads, and God knows how many ticks out there. But she was loyal, and she always came back safe and sound. On the rare occasions that she wasn’t home for dinner, I would experience a slight tinge of panic, worrying that she may never come back. I never expected that she would come back twice.\n\nOne night last autumn, I crawled into bed next to my wife. I put my hand over the book she was reading and gently pushed it down to her lap. She turned to peer at me over her reading glasses, a look of playful irritation etched across her face.\n\n“Should we look for her?” I asked.\n\nMy wife sighed and put her hands together. “It’s a nice night. She’s probably having the time of her life.”\n\n“You’re probably right.” I gave her a kiss on the cheek before resting my head on the pillow.\n\n“Don’t worry about Sadie,” she continued to assure me. “She’s tough. Let’s just enjoy the extra space tonight.” We laughed, and without another word I descended into what was admittedly the best sleep I had gotten in a long, long time.\n\nAs a week passed without Sadie’s return, we did a poor job of remaining calm. My wife and I would spend hours each day calling for her from the back patio or splitting up to trudge through the edge of the forest. We left out food and water and dirty laundry that smelled like home, but nothing was working. I found myself once again stapling flyers with her face around town - something that I had hoped I would never have to do again. Then, as if nothing had happened, there she was: standing by the sliding glass door and smiling from ear to ear.\n\nI had been pacing throughout our ranch-style home as I brushed my teeth, dreading another night without my sweet girl. After two nights of her absence, I had begun having nightmares. Sadie, shivering in the woods, cold and alone. Sadie, settling in with another family two states over. Sadie’s mutilated body on the side of the road.\n\nMy heart nearly lept out of my chest when I saw her. She hadn’t made a sound yet. She was just standing there, her eyes and mouth opened as wide as I had ever seen them, staring at me through the glass. Her tongue hanged lower than I thought possible. Her collar was missing; it must have slipped off when she was in the woods. I yanked open the door and fell to my knees as my best friend attacked my face with slobbery, stinky kisses.\n\nMy wife and I were so excited to have Sadie home that we immediately fired up the grill and threw on two thick chicken breasts. She scarfed them down so quickly that I wasn’t even sure she had chewed them at all.\n\nMoments later, the three of us were crawling into bed when we heard a sound. It was indistinct at first. It could have been a knock on the front door, or the wind knocking something over on the patio. Sadie immediately began to growl while baring all of her teeth. I had never seen her so angry. The hairs on her back stood on end, all the way from her neck to the base of her tail.\n\nJust as I opened the bedroom door to take a look, I heard the sound again. This time, it was more clear: a single tap on the sliding glass door. I rushed back into the bedroom to retrieve the handgun from my nightstand drawer.\n\n“Stay put. Don’t move,” I said to my wife as Sadie bounded off the bed and rushed to the living room.\n\n“What is it?” she asked.\n\n“Probably nothing.” I almost believed myself until Sadie erupted with a series of furious barks.\n\nI carefully made my way through our home, wondering whether we had remembered to lock the door that night. A wave of relief blanketed me as I peeked around the corner to our backdoor. There was another dog, the same size and color as Sadie, standing on our patio. Immediately, I felt glee. Prior to Sadie’s disappearance, I had been trying to convince my wife that we should adopt another dog. She was reluctant, to say the least, but I knew she wouldn’t turn away a scared stray - assuming, of course, that we couldn’t find this one’s rightful home.\n\nBased on her uncharacteristic reaction, Sadie would clearly need to warm up to the idea.\n\nI made my way to the backdoor amidst the snarls and howls coming from my once-timid mutt, and my glee was quickly replaced with nausea. Gazing through the glass door, past my own reflection, I became aware that the new dog wasn’t just Sadie’s size and color - it looked *exactly like her*.\n\nThey had the same silky white coat with the same gray spots, distributed in the same pattern across their identical bodies and faces. The same eye colors: one blue, one brown. The same chipped lower-front tooth.\n\nThe same bare necks. Not a collar in sight.\n\n*Maybe this one is Sadie,* I remember thinking to myself. She sure was acting more like our girl. Her tail, gently wagging, was tucked between her legs. She was clearly frightened by the snarling to my right, but continued to stand her ground, suggesting that she wanted to come inside only *slightly* more than she wanted to stay outdoors.\n\n“Honey,” I called. “You need to see this.”\n\nMy wife joined me in our living room. After a quick, amused remark at their similarities, she took Sadie - or at least, the one who was already inside - into our bedroom and locked her in. I opened the door to welcome our second Sadie, who remained calm but shot me a look of gratitude as she made her way to the kitchen. Sniffing as if to search for a meal, she paced the perimeter of the room with caution. She glanced, maybe knowingly, at the empty dog food dish. I wondered whether she recognized it.\n\nI called out what I thought to be her name. Her ears perked a bit - not enough to confirm any sense of familiarity, but not enough to refute it, either.\n\nWhen my wife joined me again, we stayed awake for hours discussing our situation.\n\n“Are they sisters? Litter-mates?” she asked.\n\n“They’ve got to be,” I answered. “They’re way, way too similar to be unrelated.”\n\n“Which one is Sadie? How can we tell?”\n\nI paused for a moment to consider the question. “What if neither one is? What if there’s three of them?” We laughed.\n\nBefore going to bed that night, I grabbed a Sharpie and drew a smiley face on top of our new visitor’s head.\n\nThe following days were challenging for all four of us. Sadie-One remained furious about Sadie-Two, and Sadie-Two remained terrified of Sadie-One. We had dubbed them these names in the order of their appearance at our door. Fearing that the smiley may soon fade, I made a trip to the pet store for new collars: red for One, and blue for Two.\n\nAfter much debate, my wife and I found ourselves wandering through town, putting up posters with Sadie’s pictures for a third time.\n\n“Even if we do find the owner, what next?” my wife had pleaded. “We can’t let them take either one of them. They could be taking *our* girl.”\n\nI gestured toward Sadie-Two. “It has to be that one, right? She acts just like Sadie did.”\n\n“Are you kidding?” my wife scoffed. “Don’t you remember how One reacted when she found you? She was so excited. She *knew* you.”\n\nThe girls grew more comfortable - or at least, tolerant - around one another. Sadie-One became less angry, while Sadie-Two became more confident. I found myself hoping that our search would be fruitless. My wife had made a good point: how could we give one of these dogs away without truly knowing which one we had raised? Plus, I had grown to love them both. They were slightly different, and I still strongly suspected that Two was the true Sadie, but I could see elements of my girl in both of them.\n\nFortunately for us, the posters didn’t generate any good leads. They stayed up for weeks, until the wind and snow had essentially stripped them from the telephone poles, and we only got a few calls. The first one sounded like an older man, speaking in a gruff, raspy voice.\n\n“Get rid of that bitch. She don’t belong here. She-”\n\nI hung up the phone before the man could finish his thought. I had enough on my plate as it was; I didn’t need to deal with crazy townspeople, and God knows we have a few of those in the area.\n\nThe rest of the callers were just good Samaritans who recognized Sadie from before her disappearance. “I think she belongs to a young couple out on County Line Road,” they might say. You can probably guess where we lived.\n\nOne guy, a former coworker, even called to give me my own phone number - the same one he had just called.\n\nI’m embarrassed to admit that it wasn’t until two weeks had passed that I remembered Sadie had a microchip. The girls were still somewhat unsure of one another, so we drove separately to our vet’s office to have them scanned: Sadie-One in my wife’s car, and Sadie-Two in mine. When both scans turned up nothing, I asked them to try again and again and again until they finally gave up.\n\n“These things migrate sometimes,” Dr. Brennan told us. “It’s rare, but if they get too far under the skin, the scanners won’t pick them up anymore. I’m sorry.” She offered us her pity in the form of a shrug and a frown.\n\n“What does your gut say?” I asked. “You’ve seen her a few times. Which one is the real Sadie?”\n\nShe shrugged again. “Your guess is as good as mine. They definitely have the same parents, though. No doubt about that.”\n\nI made my way outside with Sadie-Two while my wife checked out at the front desk with Sadie-One. The girls were still figuring out how to interact with each other in their own home; who knows how they would behave together in a public space. As I waited in the parking lot, puffing on a cigarette, a man approached me. He was a few decades older than me - probably in his late sixties, if I had to guess. He was tall and burly, and wore a gray newsboy cap. Sadie-Two lunged for the man excitedly, wagging her tail and slobbering on herself in her attempts to kiss him. Without so much as a greeting for me or the dog, he pointed through the front door of the veterinary office. My gaze followed his gesture. I saw Sadie-One, standing perfectly still next to my wife and staring at us through the door.\n\n“You need to get her as far away from you as possible,” he said. His voice was like old leather. “There’s something dark there. It ain’t right.” With no other words spoken, he patted me on the back and carried on down the sidewalk to his destination, wherever that may be.\n\nWhen my wife finished checking out with the receptionist, I told her about the old man. She laughed.\n\n“You hear that, One?” she said, tousling the fur on the dog’s head. “You’re nothing but trouble.”\n\nWeeks turned into months, and our girls were slowly but surely becoming best friends. We were finally starting to feel like a perfect little family - a feeling that was only intensified when my wife surprised me with a positive pregnancy test. Sadie-One and Sadie-Two didn’t take long to figure out what was going on. At night, they would sleep in our bed on opposite sides of my wife, resting their heads on her belly. Their protective instincts grew to levels I had never seen before. If not for their collars, I would have mixed them up every time I left the room.\n\nOne night, at around three in the morning, I awoke in my bed with a sharp pain in my chest. My mouth and throat were as dry as they had ever been. A strange taste coated my tongue. Something metallic. Copper, maybe.\n\nI crawled out of bed, careful not to disturb my sleeping wife and dogs, and made my way to the kitchen for some water. I downed three glasses one after the other, drinking so fast that water spilled down my chin and soaked the T-shirt I was wearing. The pain was worsening. I placed a hand across my chest as if to subdue it. The coppery taste in my mouth was getting stronger and stronger as the minutes passed. A faint, low-pitched sound suddenly emanated from the living room.\n\nI peered from the kitchen to see Sadie-One standing by the sliding glass door, staring into the edge of the forest. Her hackles were raised and her entire body was quivering. She was on high alert. The sound I had noticed was her growling: subdued and fearful. Anticipatory.\n\nI joined her by the door, hoping to figure out what was upsetting her so deeply. The forest was still, save for the gentle wavering of the pine trees in the breeze.\n\nAfter a minute or two, a figure began to emerge from beyond the trees. You could almost sense its arrival before it was even visible. It was a person - light-skinned with long, disheveled hair. It stumbled out of the brush and into our backyard, continuing on a bee line to my backdoor with a determined pace. As it grew nearer, I could see that it was a woman.\n\nThe noises coming from Sadie-One grew more frantic. She cycled through a repetition of growls, whimpers, and barks. She didn’t know how to react, but she knew she didn’t like what she saw.\n\nThe woman was pale, emaciated, and completely naked. Every one of her ribs jutted out of her torso, sharp as blades. Her skin was covered in dozens of bruises and lacerations. Her eyes were gaunt and almost appeared to be retracted into their sockets. If she weren’t half-dead, she would be beautiful. She stopped just inches shy of the sliding glass door.\n\nShe was my wife.\n\nHer eyes offered a silent plea for a moment before she spoke.\n\n“Honey,” she said. Her voice was muffled through the glass. “Oh my God, I found you.”\n\n“How…” I began, turning my head slightly towards the hallway that led to our bedroom door, but careful not to let her leave my peripheral vision.\n\nShe reached for the handle and attempted to pull the door open. It didn’t budge. “Please,” she begged. “Let me in.”\n\nI stood still with my mouth agape, unable to move and equally unable to respond. Sadie-Two began barking from the bedroom. Sadie-One was now snarling at the glass.\n\n“I see you found her,” she laughed through tears. “Hi Sadie girl! Mommy missed you. I was out looking for you, but I ended up… somewhere else.”\n\nSadie-One seemed even angrier now.\n\n“You have to let me in,” she pleaded once more. “There’s something horrible out there. It’s coming.”\n\nThe wind had picked up. Her hair blew sideways across her face, obstructing all of its features. The trees were shaking violently now.\n\n“Why are you just standing there? Let me IN!” With her final word, she raised a hand and slapped her palm against the glass. Startled, I took a step back and dropped the glass I was still holding. It shattered onto the floor below.\n\n“Honey,” a voice called out from our bedroom. “What’s going on?”\n\nMy wife, the one standing by the door, took a step back. The hair fell away from her face, revealing bulging, terrified eyes.\n\nMy freeze response kicked in once again. Despite one dog’s snarls and another’s barks, I heard the unmistakable sound of a drawer opening. My nightstand drawer.\n\n“Is everything okay? I’m coming out there!”",

        "text": "  \n\nAs I'm writing this account I'm hoping that someone, anyone, just reads it and says something. Anything! Just comment hi or fuck you or really anything! I just wanna know that there is someone out there; that there is a sign of life still out there….\n\nEverything was normal before it all went south. I had gone to bed by 1am that night. It was quite ordinary for me to stay up late. I live in an apartment with my parents and my sister. They all go to bed pretty early, around 10ish so I’m the only one who’s awake till late at night. Anyways, I remember waking up at around 3 in the morning. I woke up sleepily and checked my phone for the time hoping it wasn’t 7am already. The time read 3:22. I rejoiced. I dragged my feet as I walked towards the washroom keeping my head hung down. I have to cross my parents’ bedroom door on the way to the bathroom. On my way back I noticed their door was open. Huh. They usually have it closed. Their bed is right in front of the door too. I looked inside and saw their bed was empty. Weird but nothing completely out of the blue. Except I couldn’t find them anywhere in the house. It’s an apartment. I didn’t have to look much. They were nowhere in the house. I felt uneasy. Had something happened? Was there an emergency? And if there was why didn’t they inform me before leaving?\n\nI strode over to my room to wake my sister up hoping she might know something or maybe they had informed her. She sleeps with me. I switched on the light and was about to call out her name when I stopped. Our bed was empty too. It was dark when I had left the room so must not have noticed earlier. She wasn’t there and she was certainly not in the house. Where’d they all go? I got my phone and rang their number. No one picked up. Not one single time did anyone pick up. I had put the phone on loudspeaker and the outgoing ring was the only sound that filled the atmosphere. The entire house was eerily silent. Not even the steady drip of water from the faucet was heard. It’s as if the house was waiting quietly for someone to pick up and tear apart the silence with their voice. But no one picked up. I was getting impatient and angry at this point. How could they just leave in the middle of the night without informing me or picking up my calls?! That was just irresponsible on their part. How bad could this emergency be?! That is if it were an emergency….\n\nSo I waited. I was sat on the couch in the living room with my hands crossed across my chest waiting. 30 minutes went by. One hour. Still no calls and no texts. I was genuinely worried. I paced the living room anxiously for the better part of the hours. Did something really bad happen? Are they alright? I just wanted them home. Another hour went by and still no contact with them. It was 5:30 now. The first streaks of light must have strewn across the calm morning sky by now. The pleasant chirping of birds must have started by now. \n\nExcept I didn’t hear any birds. It was as silent as it was at 3.That was weird. I walked over to the balcony door and pulled the curtains aside. Complete darkness greeted me. I opened the door and walked out. It wasn’t the winters. It should have been light by now. The sky should have been of a light blue hue instead of the pitch black void that it was. I couldn’t even see the moon. No stars at all. I panicked. Something very wrong was going on. A part of me felt like I must be asleep and just in the midst of a nightmare. It certainly felt like a dream. The place was a familiar one but not quite the real one. I pinched myself really hard and it hurt. I tried to count the fingers on my hands and to my horror I could see and count them perfectly. Which meant that I was very much awake and this was very much happening.\n\n“what the FUCK”, I whispered. For someone reason I felt scared to break the silence. I didn’t want to speak loudly. When I had accepted that fact, I looked over at the other apartments. The lights were off except for a few lights that the neighbours keep on throughout the night. It was as if they were still sleeping. I peeked over towards the gate of the building complex. I couldn’t see the watchman out sitting on his chair. Could be in his cabin but I was now having a tough time believing that. The streets were empty. Completely empty. 15 minutes went by and not a single vehicle drove across. Something was definitely wrong. I went inside got dressed and stepped out of my house and walked over to my neighbour’s door. I rang the doorbell and waited. Once, twice.  no one came.\n\nNo no no!! I hurried over to another door and rang their doorbell once before starting to bang on their door. No response. Dread shrouded me as I climbed the staircase to the upper floor taking two steps at a time. The same process followed. I rang their doorbell and banged on the door and then panicked as I got no response. It was still quiet. More than it normally is. More than I’d like. The silence was deafening. The atmosphere felt thick and static. As if nothing was moving. As if the air particles themselves have stopped moving. \n\nI slumped by the wall. I couldn’t even fathom what the hell was going on. I wrapped my arms around my head and sat there trying to make sense of what was happening. I took deep breaths in order to calm down and started thinking. I thought about exactly what had happened before I had gone to sleep. I was up late reading stuff on the internet. First it was the cheesy wattpad love stories. Then I had come across creepypastas. Funny how I ended up on that side of the internet. A particular creepypasta had intrigued me. It spoke of a parallel universe. Kind of dystopian. That interested me. I was then up for an hour reading articles on the parallel universe theory and the research that was being done on the topic. Could it be……Nahh that was impossible right. I mean maybe not impossible but not feasible either. Right?\n\nJust then elevator door dinged open. I was startled. What followed sucked the breath right out of my living body and made my heart skip several beats. Just as the doors opened a man ran out of the elevator door screaming followed by what looked like an animal but wasn’t. It was horrendous. The creature had a wolflike face but the body of an ape. It was of a crimson colour and its paws had the sharpest claws I had ever seen. Not that I had seen many. The abomination made a sound that sounded like a metal screech. My entire body convulsed momentarily when I heard that hellish scream. He was apparently chasing the man who looked terrified. His clothes were ripped and blood was dripping from several parts of his body. And then suddenly they were whipped away. Gone. A white chasm had opened mid air and engulfed them away. Just like that and silence reigned once again. Where the chasm had opened, there were blur streaks of line like a glitch in a computer screen would look like. \n\nI was trembling at this point. I got up shakily and walked down to my floor. My legs were jelly and it was near impossible to climb down the stairs without the support of the railing. \n\nI went in my house and tried to sleep hoping it would all be normal when I wake up. The thing is I can’t sleep. Go figure. So here I am typing this all out. Hoping someone knows something and can explain. Or at the very least, there is someone out there… \n\nI’ll update more if I can.",

        "text": "So a little context before i get into the main part of this story and im sorry it might get a little confusing and im writing this late at night and i just have to get it out their just in case so pleas e bear with me. OK so context I live in a place where shops and stores are prominent but a car is pretty much needed to traverse around here, about a year ago me and my friend had wanted to go to a store and got lost so we decided to just get food and go home as it had been getting late so we decided on McDonalds, and for some reason this McDonalds was the best we ever had so we decided to make it a weekly trip at least once a week to get food here and mind you this is a hour and a half drive sometimes more depending on traffic. Anyway fast forward a few months he moved to Florida and me and our other friends decided to get that McDonalds because we were hungry and decided they needed to try it. On the drive their it was normal up until we get to a certain point about where we would past the golf course on our left but a few exits before, we see a truck that couldn't have been made anytime after 2005 had no driver no passengers whatsoever, the windows weren't tinted and the truck was pretty low down so we could visibly see no one was in it but it was moving and driving as if someone was, it was changing lanes and even speeding up and slowing down to let certain people into its lane, thankfully we were in the hov so we were able to watch it for about 30 seconds but after we lost it the whole day we felt weirded out. Fast forward a few days every day since i had the feeling i had been getting watched i had been waking up randomly seeing figures but i always thought they were just images of my still half asleep brain, this was until my friend had brought up the exact thing that hap been happening and that's when i knew for a fact something was up. over the course of about 3 more trips back to back to the mcdonalds we had feelings of being watched we had seen strange things and people starring at us for no reason but we thought we were just paranoid. This was all until 4 weeks ago we went on a drive, where we live is a place called the pencil and its a drive near a beach that's about 20 minutes so we decided to drive. we only saw one thing but that one incedent is what started all of this off. On the drive down we saw a pulled over truck with no lights on no people in it and a police car showing upto that truck just pulling in. we decided to go back and turn around it took us not even 2 min to get back to where we were and all we saw was an empty truck with the door open no police car and no people not even a trace someone was their and as we sped home i could have swore i saw something following us in the mirror but every time i looked i didn't even see a car. And now brings us to today, it started off small but has progressed alot at first it was just me waking up randomly bc i was sweating too much from heat or i would hear random creaks or noises i would chock upto my fat cat just walking around but just as im writing this stuff sounded like it fell from the kitchen but when i went in it was all completely fine. i can tell its getting bolder thankfully i haven't seen what it looks like but even as i type this i can feel it watching just out of sight getting more confident and honestly i dont know what it wants to do. anyway ill try my best to keep this updated sorry its so long but the whole situtation wouldn't make sense if their wasent context if anyone has thoughts of what it might be that would be very appropriated my thoughts are alien but i don't know much anyway thank you all for reading will update soon and stay safe.",

        "text": " I am a dog groomer, working on the road in a mobile grooming van. The vans are self contained grooming salons, including a tub, a table, shampoo cubbies, a vacuum hose built into the wall, a 50 gallon water tank and a big generator in the back to run it all so clients dont have to worry about us tripping breakers by trying to plug the van into their house. The last time one of the generators died I tried to plug into someone's garage, and the second I turned on the dryer their whole house went dark, as did the van, and the dog had to go home sopping wet and unfinished. The company that I work for is very small, just three vans and three employees, we all commute to our boss's house where the vans are parked in their driveway, the shed in the back yard serving as our “supply shed” where all of the extra shampoos, cleaners, RV antifreeze and various tools and extra parts for the interior of the salons, are kept. Our boss's house is set back into the woods, the road they live on is quiet and untraveled, the only noises once the sun goes down are the trees rustling in the wind, the neighbor's cat prowling the bushes, and the seasonal bugs and animals of the Pennsylvanian forest.   \t\n\nAs the company's longest employee, I am sometimes tasked with training new hires to use the van, get them used to the daily ordeal of existing in a vehicle, getting them acquainted with the vans show them what all of the buttons, levers and switches do, run them through cleaning and prepping for the next day, stocking, filling the water tank, and filling the propane tank for the heater for when it's cold outside. One of the hardest concept for people to grasp sometimes is the fact that, when you're working in a metal box parked in front of someone's condo, you are a slave to the weather and your environment. If it's raining outside you have to open the two vents in the ceiling, one fan rotating to suck air in, and the other rotating to blow air out to try and keep a constant stream of fresh air and keep the humidity under control. During the summer, this is easy since all you need is the air conditioner, but during the winter this is a bit more difficult since sometimes you have to decide whether the blast of frozen outside air is worth keeping the humidity in check. As a general rule of thumb, the more humid the inside of the van, the longer the dog will take to dry, and the harder it will be to get a nice, even haircut in a timely manner. \t\n\nDuring one of these ride along days, I was showing the new hire how to work the vents and how to tell which direction the fans were pointing when I felt the van shift a bit. I didn't think too much of it, sometimes we had to parallel park on residential streets and a delivery van going a little too fast can sometimes cause the van to shift with the force of the wind. The new girl braced herself a little, “is that normal?” Her eyes were wide, like she had forgotten that the room we were standing in was being held 7 inches off the ground by flexible suspension and rubber wheels.   \t\n\n“Yeah, you'll get used to it, every road is different, and the different towns around here have different amounts of traffic, so you'll figure out the best spots to park as you go along.”   \t\n\nShe nodded, still looking a little like she was about to lose her balance, but she pushed on, leaning against the wall and changing the subject to ask more questions about what certain buttons did on the wall behind me, and how to check the water level throughout the day. She asked questions like, “have you ever run out of water before?” I had, and I explained that water conservation and a certain routine for bathing the dogs was important to making sure you had enough water to last the day.  \n\nA couple of houses later and I had her drying a dog in the back while I sat in the driver's seat and made a phone call, the back of the van was separated from the cab with a wall, and between the driver and passenger seats was a door that went into the salon area. The door was essentially just a frame with a large plexiglass window, and I could watch her through the door to make sure everything was running smoothly back there while I returned a missed call I received from my grandmother. Usually, she would leave me a voicemail, and it was generally something simple, asking if I needed to use the washer and dryer any time soon, or if I wanted to come over for dinner, but today was just a missed call and a text that just read “Call me back.” It was very unlike her to not tell me what it was she was calling for, my grandmother is a very straightforward woman, making her opinions and her needs immediately known, and not beating around the bush. For her to be as vague as she was, something must have been wrong.   \t\n\nI dialed her number and she picked up right after the first ring. “Hey, are you okay?” \t\n\n“Yeah, I'm fine, why wouldn't I be?” I was confused, her tone made her sound panicky and nervous. \t“I don't know, but something was telling me I needed to call you, and tell you to be careful tonight.” She let out a sigh, “I don't know what you need to be careful of, but just... be careful.” \t\n\nI assured her that, while I was in the van, I was always careful, I was, after all, cruising around in a 5 ton, 10 foot tall vehicle, and that wasn't exactly the nicest thing to drive on the narrow, windy, pothole filled roads of rural Pennsylvania. Too many times I have had to purposefully run red lights because the yellow light only stayed yellow for a split second and I didn't have the stopping power to make it, or I had missed a road because the curve was too tight and I was sure that if I tried to take the turn, I would surely end up toppling over. This didn't mean that I didn't believe her that some force had pushed her to call me, she was an intuitive person, taking lessons and warnings from thin air with seemingly no rhyme or reason, but she had never steered me wrong. If my grandmother told me to be careful, then I better be goddamn careful.   \t\n\nHer intuition had predicted so many things in the past, she always said the universe gave her gut punches. Anyone that knew her knew that if she had a prediction for you, it would most likely come true. When I was in high school, I worked at a pizzeria about a mile's walk up the road, my shift was from 4 to 9 and my boyfriend at the time would usually come pick me up so I didn't have to walk a mile home through the woods in the dark. One afternoon, I was getting ready to leave for work when my grandmother knocked on my bedroom door.   \t\n\n“Hey, can I talk to you?” I told her to come in and she opened the door cautiously, “So, don't walk home from work tonight okay? I don't want you out in the woods tonight.” This wasn't an unusual request, though it usually had to do with weather or bear sightings in the area, but it was a clear spring day and there was no rain on the horizon. “I don't know why, but I want your boyfriend to bring you home, I'm afraid that if you're out there tonight, you're going to get hurt.” \t\n\nI agreed, though I had walked home every night for the past few weeks since the weather had been so nice and nothing bad had happened yet, and headed into work.   \t\n\nAt the end of my shift, my boyfriend came and picked me up, we had gotten a calzone and some fries to share for when we got home, and we started the short drive down the dirt, tree lined road back to my grandmothers house. There is one spot on the road that was always my favorite spot to stop when I would walk home, and I would smoke a cigarette while sitting on the guard rail with my headphones on. In this spot, the road towered about 20 feet above a small creek that, on a clear night, sparkled with the reflection of the moon, a guardrail was the only thing separating you from the drop off the side of the road, and on the other side of the road was a cliff face, standing about 10 feet over the road, the moss covered rock faces were always wet and they glistened green in the darkness. On a normal night I would sit in this spot for a good 30 minutes sometimes, depending on how into an album I was, but on this night, as the headlights of my boyfriend's Ford Escort Wagon shown around the corner and illuminated my sitting spot on the side of the road, what greeted us there was not the peaceful overlook I would normally revel in. Instead, what greeted us was a crushed and jagged SUV, on it's side, the dirt road glistening with broken glass and a puddle of oil mixing with transmission fluid draining from the cragged edged of the smashed up hood. The car's rear fender was crumpled and folded over the guardrail, which was also twisted and warped, and instead of the moon reflecting off of the creek, this time, it was reflecting off of the drivers side window, which was aimed at the sky. A faint crying was coming from the inside, and we jumped out of the car, spotting a woman sitting, clutching her 3 year old son in her arms, sitting on what was left of the passenger side door, the woman was crying, but the boy was kissing her face assuring her that “it's gonna be okay mommy.” \n\nWe ended up having to break the left back window with a rock to help lift the woman and her son out of the car and safely get their feet back on the ground. Neither of them were hurt, just a bruised ego, and a totaled car. She had swerved to miss hitting a deer and lost control of the car, flipping it onto its side and it slid into the guardrail. Odds are, had I walked home from work that night, I would have been sitting in that exact spot where the guardrail, now contorted and sagging, had stopped that car from going over the side of the road. I would have been sitting, blissfully unaware of the danger coming up behind me, enveloped in my headphones, smoking a cigarette. Odds are, had I walked home from work that night, I would have died.   \t\n\nNow, here my grandmother was, nearly 10 years later, telling me again, to be careful, a warning I learned a long time ago to head without question.   \t\n\nI had to take the new girl back to the boss's house early that day so she could go get her son from school, and I had one more dog after that that I would take care of by myself. It was late November, and I worked 10 hour days, so it was usually dark by my last dog at this time of year, especially this client, their house was set way back in the woods, off of a long dirt road. I'm convinced that, even if it were the middle of the summer it would look dark back there, the thick canopy of trees blocked out any glimpse of the sky. I finished up with Tuffy the terrier, he usually took me about an hour, and packed up the van to head back for the night. As I was reversing down the driveway towards the road, I kept my eyes on the side mirrors, making sure I didn't scrape any trees or the stone wall that line the right side of the driveway. I glanced up at the backup camera screen for a quick second and slammed the breaks. I only saw it for a second, but it was clear as day, a face in the camera. It looked like someone wearing an ill-fitting halloween mask where the face holes didn't quite fit correctly. One eye socket was pulled slightly up on the outer corner, while the other was scrunched in towards the nose and drooped down into the cheek and the eyes were set deep, deep into the folds of skin. The nose was straight until the very tip, which was upturned and jutted out to the side, the mouth hanging loosely, the lower lip falling below a set of crooked, plaque encrusted teeth. Small tufts of black hair stuck out in patches on the scalp, the bald patches were white and scaly. I slammed the car into park, clutching my chest. Who was that? And why were they standing behind a large truck going in reverse?\n\nThat's when it hit me. The backup camera's location. It was on the top of the roof of the van, at least 9 and a half feet off the ground. Whoever that was was close enough to the camera to where I could only see their face, which means they were either nine and a half feet tall, or they were climbing up the back of the van. I didn't like either one of those options, but weighing the two of them, I suppose I would take tall over using the van as a jungle gym. \t\n\nThe van swayed, the same way it had earlier when the new girl was with me. But I was parked, in the woods, in a driveway, there were no trucks to drive by and push the van around. I thought back to where I was parked earlier in the day and realized, the odds of a truck driving by with enough speed to move the van on that very narrow one way street were very, very unlikely. I quickly hit the lock button on the door, locking all of the doors, and put the van back in reverse. I just wanted to get out of the woods, it was too dark, and the van had a headlight out, and I could barely see through the thickening November fog. I stared at the backup camera as I made my way out of the driveway and onto the road, at first, I didn't see anything out of the ordinary, until I looked closer. From the angle of the camera I could see most of the back doors, and one of the hinges on the top of one of the doors didn't match the others, it had too many ridges. And then it moved, unfurling into fingers that were wrapped around the side of the door and the pulled up onto the roof and out of sight. The van swayed again, but this time it was more like a jolt, and I threw the van into drive and took off as quickly as I felt comfortable on this road with no street lights. There was a thudding on the roof, a rhythmic *'boom boom boom scrape scrape scrape'* coming from the top of the plastic air conditioning vents. Thats all that was keeping it out of the van, a thin black plastic hood, a plastic fan and a screen. That was all there was between it being outside the van... and it being inside the van with me. I skidded around the last lightless corner, feeling the uneven weight on the top of the van shift with the turn, and made it to an intersection, the light was green and I sped through it, finding the first brightly lit parking lot. I tore the key out of the ignition, jumped out of the van and ran for my life. I stopped when I reached the road, there were tons of cars on the road, a few drivers even staring at me like I was crazy, I was, after all, running like hell away from a work van with no jacket on in November. I turned back towards the van. There was nothing on the roof. I walked a very wide circle around the van, looking from all sides to see if there was anything on, or in, the van. There was nothing, and no one. I put my keys between my fingers and slowly walked back towards it, opening the back doors first and peering around the storage area, then the front doors, checking under the dashboard and seats, and then the sliding door to the salon, even checking in the tub and inside the tiny cubbyholes where we store the towels, knowing damn well no one would fit in the foot and a half tall little cabinet. I stood outside the van, breathing, watching my breath steam in the cold night air, and grabbed my jacket from the front, lighting a cigarette. I didn't usually smoke at work, but dammit I needed this.   \t\n\nAfter it took what felt like an eternity for my heart to stop racing, I got back in the van and headed back towards my boss's house. I was only about 5 minutes up the road at this point, and I just wanted to be back so I could get in my own car and go home.   \t\n\nThe closer I got to my boss's house, the darker the roads got as street lights became more and more sparse, and soon, my high beams were the only thing lighting the scenery. I passed a corn field, and out the passenger side window, I saw it. It was the height of a child, probably no more than 5 feet tall, its body was lumpy and misshapen, again, like it was wearing skin that just didn't fit. I wasn't wearing clothes, but it had no defining genitalia or and hair other than the black tufts on it's head. It started at me out of its eye holes, and lifted one arm, the skin hanging in lumpy sacks off of it and pointed one spindly finger at me. It took a step back into the corn field, and then it was gone. \t\n\nWhen I pulled into my boss's driveway I didn't even take the time to fill the water tank, I ran the antifreeze through the lines to winterize as quickly as possible and then I threw myself into my Prius and took off as quickly as I could, texting my boss that I wasn't feeling well and I would finish prep when I got back in the morning.   \t\n\nThe next morning, when I pulled into the driveway, my boss was standing outside, looking up the side of my van at the air conditioner vent.   \t\n\n“Hey, I just noticed the vent is cracked a bit on top.” \t\n\nI started at him, speechless, and then glances at the vent, there were marks on the top and sides of the vent, it looked like some large creature had been gnawing on it. \t\n\n“It's probably from low tree branches, just be careful if you see any and take it slow when you do, I'll buy a replacement for the front, but try not to crack the back one too.” \t\n\nI nodded, apologizing, of course it was low hanging tree branches. What else could it have been.",
