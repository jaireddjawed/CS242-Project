        "text": "I used to love math, I had amazing math professors for algebra, trig, and pre Calc who made me fall in love with math, I even used paintings of famous mathematicians in my art history class as an excuse to write about math. I would read books about Euclid in my spare time and even learned on my own. and I was all together considering being a Math major rather than a CompSci major at one point.\n \nBut then in Calc 1 I had a nightmare of a teacher some how made me dislike math and even question my own abilities, I don't really want to talk crap about him because I feel it is tasteless to do so. But the Dean ended up getting enough complaints from students/faculty that he is no longer at my college or teaching for that matter. I got my first C in math and I have honestly lost my stride in math. I was taking Discrete math and Calc2 but I am failing miserably right now. \n \nI know its mostly my fault and its not fair to blame it on one teacher (especially considering my new teacher(s) are amazing) because I have gotten lazy and all together just lost my will to continue in math. I just bought a book called \"A Mind for Numbers: How to Excel at Math and Science\" that I plan on reading over spring break and maybe that could help.\n \nI guess my main issue is I know what it takes to do well in math which is study and practice (at least thats what works for me) but I just don't have the will to do it, I feel like I've reached this mental block that is stopping me from going forward. I'm really seeking any advice at this point.\n \nHow can I learn to love math again?",

We banged shi1 out and had one official meeting/syncup a week as a team.  The manager made sure the pieces fit together and connected people to collaborate where appropriate.\n\n~5 years ago in a new team, management wanted to force on \"agile\".  It hired external instructors just on agile, sent us on training.  A few engineers were plucked to be full-time scrum masters and product owners.  Half the week was spent on regularly scheduled meetings (demos, retrospect, backlog grooming, planning, story points card game, etc etc).  The manager was now a \"coach\" behind the scenes and was less technical.\n\nNow, I hear stuff like kanban, \"lean\", etc and it all just seems like viruses infecting software teams, leeching $$ from upper management while sucking productivity and lifeblood from devs.  On a recent poll in Blind about Agile, the results were overwhelmingly \"Made my team a disaster\", followed by \"Made my team perform worse\".\n\nI can understand the virus having its own agenda to feed and multiply but not the management falling for it and even doubling down.  The only carrot seemed to be a \"progress bar\" in the form of the burndown chart but that can and often is bs.  I can imagine websites that change often benefit from this but not other types of projects.\n\nIs it just a matter of higher levels of management wanting as little to do with sw as possible, and are comfortable seeing a dashboard of \"progress\" that they think represents reality?",

I save time because I can verify that their solution is correct quickly.\n\nBut for general computing, I'm not sure there's a way to do this. For example, if I just want to run some general code in the cloud. How do I verify that people have actually run the code correctly, without having to run it myself? \n\nI could do something similar to Ethereum and have the entire network verify it for me, and only accept it as correct when other people have verified it and the result is on the central chain long enough. However, this creates a lot of extra work for the whole network.\n\nI realize this question is a little vague, but are there any strategies to verify that a general program was run correctly without  requiring someone else (either me, or an entire network) to also run the program?\n",

        "text": "A friend recently came to me about some confusion as to why Wikipedia uses big-O for both the average-case and the worst-case analyses for algorithms. They thought that big-O was used for the worst-case analysis, and that big-Ω was used for best-case analysis.\n\nI replied that this was wrong, since big-O and big-Ω are descriptions of properties of mathematical functions and therefore don't have any relation (_per se_, obviously they are used in these analyses) to best/average/worst-case analyses, which went completely against his intuition. After some investigation it turns out he picked up this notion from [Havard's CS50 course](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x), which in lecture 3 claims (or appears to claim, which is confusing if you're a student) that big-O was used for worst-case analysis, and big-Ω was used for best-case analysis. ([link to relevant part of the lecture](https://youtu.be/U9o49qwa6hk?t=3331), [link to summary video which re-enforces this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoZPTyGL2IQ&amp;t=88))\n\nIt turns out that this is a pretty common confusion, and plenty of examples can be found on the internet ([1](https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/80698/what-is-the-difference-between-big-o-and-worst-case-run-time), [2](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4645757/big-o-notations-definition), [3](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15420848/big-o-for-worst-case-running-time-and-%CE%A9-is-for-the-best-case-but-why-is-%CE%A9-used), [4](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-Big-O-notation-and-Worst-case-Analysis-of-an-Algorithm), just google \"big o best case worst case\"), but pretty much the majority of other answers along with Wikipedia back up my notion that big-O is to do with properties of mathematical functions and not _intrinsically_ related to best/worst-case analyses.\n\nWhat's confusing then is that a very well-known course at a very prestigious university seems to teach something that's just straight-up wrong and confusing, which conflicts with what I've been taught and other resources I've found on the internet. There also seems to be no other discussions on this I've found in relation to this specific course, and since it's supposed to be a introductory course it seems weird for it to teach a wrong idea. I'm not the one going crazy, am I?",

This is more of a thought experiment to get me going rather than a concrete study.\n\nI tried using a graph database (Neo4j) thinking it would be optimized for this kind of thing, but the performance in DFS pathfinding is godawful.\n\nThank you for any and all contributions.\n\nEDIT: Thanks to everyone for the great responses!",

I understnad that {01}* is the group 01 repeated any number of times ie lambda, 01,0101,010101 but what exactly is {0,1}*? Is it similar to {0} star + {1} star ie lambda, 0, 1, 01, 001, 011, 0001 or else any number of 0's followed by any number of ones?\n\n\nThanks",
