        "text": "I know that I shouldn’t be thinking about this, and I should forget about this guy all together. But, it’s all very perplexing. \nI really need to express this right now… I feel like I get some sort of closure just talking about it sometimes. This will probably be ranty… Sorry.\n\nMy narc would sometimes open to me and reveal some level of self-awareness;\n“All my ex’ have mental breakdowns. It’s like something I do causes it, like I bring up a past trauma… but it’s like I’m an angel and it helps them to be better on there own once they move on”\nWhen I try to have a serious conversation: “It’s like I can’t open up. I just can’t talk about this. I can’t explain it, but I am incapable. I am a retard”\n“My mom is a bitch. She loved me too much, and I was devastated.”  ??\n\nUnfortunately for me these moments gave me hope and made me somehow think I was special to him for opening to me. \nI was delusional for not seeing these red flags, but I wasn’t ready to admit that yet…. But regardless, these kinds of moments are what make it so hard for me to let go, and they also make me question his level of self-awareness. \n\nMy narc was very spiritual and believed himself to be a healer shaman. This was also a great excuse for randomly withholding sex with no explanation, ignoring me, avoiding talking about me, avoid talking about if we’re even dating, sleeping with other women, ghosting etc. \nHe read a lot of Carlos Castaneda, and subsequently I did too. He would gift them to me, but he’d never talk about his opinion of them with me…. He’d just say that the books guided him &amp; nothing more.\nIt perplexes me to this day. The main character of the book (who my narc would tell ME I was like, and that I should take a lesson) is in my opinion a narcissist. The book is in many ways teachings on removing the ego, but it also touches on cognitive dissonance, psychedelia, magical thinking etc. In many ways being with this narc felt like brainwashing. It’s like I totally lost touch with myself &amp; reality. He subtly stole my self esteem with subtle comments I didn't even notice and then created a false reality.\nI'm still confused after the fact and trying to piece together the chain of events and timeline.. I also believe he hypnotized me without my full knowledge several times. \nANYWAYS\nBefore going no contact and blocking him he would ghost me for a few days and then randomly message me; \n“Did you read (insert castenada book) in here yet?” or “do you get the meaning in the Castaneda books yet?” \nThis messed with my head SO hard.\n-Is he totally aware that he brainwashed me &amp; just flaunting it?\n-Does he believe I’m the narcissist? Is he projecting?\n-Is he consciously/subconsciously trying to fix his narcissism problem with these books?\n\nThe books talk about “petty tyrants”; abusive, or annoying people who cause harm in communities. We worked together, &amp; the book has teachings about how “warriors” (I think he believed himself to be a warrior) must work with petty tyrants for the sake of the “community” (me, I believe).  I could go FOREVER down the rabbit hole of how confused I am by him reading this stuff.\n.\nThis is an essay on Castenada’s work. :\n\n“This leads us to the subject of compassion, which is easy to talk about, but hard to enact. We become compassionate when we realize that the petty tyrant is acting in the way that she acts because she is in pain. Period. Her harsh words and actions are stemming directly from her own suffering, and whether it comes out in the form of anger, self-pity, or trouble-making, its source is personal pain. When somebody behaves aggressively and hurtfully towards us, that person suffers the greatest pain. That is why she behaves as she does.\nAgain, this is not an excuse to pity someone, nor to assert ourselves as less wounded or \"more together\" than her. Pity and compassion are very different things. Pity comes from a place of self-importance and superiority; compassion comes from the humility of having seen objectively and clearly the shared human predicament we're all in together.”\n----------\nAgain.. Is he aware that he’s a narcissist and somehow asking me to show him compassion? Is he aware I’m a codependant and trying to show me compassion? (Is he even capable of this)... Or is this just more layers.. Him WANTING me to be confused about this.. all an elaborate cloud of smoke and mirrors that probably means NOTHING? Was this all malicious? Or.. Is he really just totally self-unaware? *sigh*\n\n&amp; honestly, in some 'round a bout way he DID “heal” me. All the trauma I endured with him DID surface childhood trauma and brought me to an all time low that forced me to seek help. It brought up the abuse I suffered as a child from nmom, and all of my codependency issues that I have been living in denial of. \n&amp; one day at a time I’m learning self-love and self-care and to let go. &amp; I feel this is pivitol. \nBut, no matter how mindful I try to be..\nMy mind is still trying to obsess, and ask these questions.. ! I feel like he’s somehow in me. Maybe the hypnotism makes this worse.. I don't know. But,.. I feel like I’m acting like him. Like he's trapped under my skin. He’s still trying to mess with me in weird ways that make me look paranoid or crazy, like posting specific songs.. or adding all these people I know to his FB (when I know he doesn’t know them..)\nI just feel so darn crazy sometimes!\nEspecially because my narc made it so that me healing as a person after the breakup (DESPITE HIM) is still his personal victory!\nAHH! It just makes me so sick. Get him out!\n",

        "text": "The holidays have been really tough on myself and my husband. His car has been outhe for a year. Then my 95 ford finally kicked the bucket. We decided to get a new car. My first car, being 26. Always bought out right. Got a 2015 kia soul+, beautiful green. It fit my husband and i like gloves. It is amazing. I went and visited my best friend at her work to show off and her parents. They were all so proud of us. Though I promised my husband it would be  his car, we ended up picking the one I wanted and he also fell in love. (Its rare. We like so many different things it was like to hear universe was saying: yup this is your car now.) \n\nAnyway, my victory was going through the process and having ourselves financially stable enough to afford it. Esp since it only had 17k on it! \n\nWe got what we liked and I love it. Half of me wants to go see my parents... which I haven't done since March of this year. I know better though. The thing was even while signing all the paper work for the car and everything I felt I was doing the wrong thing. Even when I know I'm not. It was what we needed. I felt relieved to have support and my lovely husband telling me everything is okay. Im just so used to being proud of myself then having someone negative  (parents) tell me I screwed up or that I got taken advantage of. I know the car was over 2k more than a brand new no miles on it, but I didn't care. To me, whose been driving a 10+ yrs old car... it seems surreal. Even the payments are affordable. \n\nAnyway, I wanted to share my victory and my parents loss. Since I told them to leave me alone they never contacted me again. Dropped me like a hot rock. Sometimes I cry about it. Feeling rejected, but I remember I have my own family who love and support me more than they ever will. Here's to praying this next year beats the shit out of this last horrible year. Come on 2017! I'm ready!",

        "text": "\n\nThere seems to be a few posts of late that are similar to: why is the N contacting me, should I respond ?/should I contact them ect?/what are they doing?/what are their motives?\n\nDo you want the cancerous tumor that causes pain and revels in your humiliation back in your life? Give them an inch and they'll take 100 miles.\n\nLet's say this pure and simple. NS have no feelings, they don't care about you, they never have and never will. You were just a person they could hurt and destroy in order to get feed and they most likely are getting back in contact in order to see how the land lies, to see if they can still control you or if you are still under their control, for a N their need for feed is like a heroin addicts need for a fix.\n\nDon't rationalize it, they never cared, it was all fake, lies and manipulation. If they did care they wouldn't have hurt you and if they did, and if they did, a normal healthy person says sorry, shows remorse and usually doesn't do it again or tries hard not to.\n\nI'm an INFJ on the Myers-briggs chart and we do something called the INFJ door slam, basically if I feel I cannot trust a person or they have hurt me and keep hurting me and I try everything to fix the problem and I mean everything then they get door slammed, we never do it to punish or do it lightly but only as a very last resort, when our pain is too great and we can't possibly take any more. After a door slam, and it is a quite quick affair, no drama or shouting, I just leave the situation and their lives with dignity and I get to put myself first, give myself space to grieve and move on. Once a doorslam has been done, it's nearly impossibly to undo, there is no contact, no going back because as soon as that person became untrustworthy they become meaningless to me, and when I love someone I would do anything for them, but when they take me for granted, hurt me, I will feel and bear pain to try and fix things but only until the pain gets too great. If they said sorry, and tried not to hurt me again, and actually didn't hurt me, well then you can trust them. But an N will be charming and fake remorse but will keep hurting you as that's all they are there for. Don't fall for their manipulation, be assertive and say no.\n\nYour pain is their feed, and it's OK to door slam anyone who keeps hurting you and isn't earning your trust daily. It's OK to say I'm worth more than this and it's not OK for you to treat me this way, I have to protect myself because I am worthy of respect and love. NS want you to depend and need them so when they leave they get feed knowing you are upset, they destroy your self worth and gas light you, so you are weak and can be drained (like a vampire of spider) of feed, they have ensured an endless supply. They distort your self worth and self appearance so much so, you actually feel what they say or make you feel is true, they do this because if you saw reality you would have door slammed them a long time OK. Learn and know your worth, be assertive, door slam, walk away and move on with your life. Set clear boundaries of what is and isn't acceptable behavior and treatment. Stand your ground, its not being mean it's self preservation and self love.\n\nIf you don't, you are teaching the N and other NS who can spot a person who is molded to take N abuse how they should behave and treat you to get their feed.\n\nNs are broken, you can't fix them, they are deeply flawed they can't let anyone in, they fear rejection so keep you in their web, until they have taken all they can and you are dumped.\n\nBut you are worth something, don't let a bully who has no feelings define you, they are so messed with mummy issues, how can they judge anyone?\n\nYou are weak to them because you trust, love, care and grow. But to normal healthy people this is why we love you.\n\nThe reasons why NS think you are weak is what makes us human. How messed up is that?\n\nThey are dead inside and can't grow, they are a bitter abandoned child. Don't let a insecure robot (no feelings) dictate your self worth. It's like a virgin defining sex, utterly absurd!\n\nThe truth is they need you more than you need them, they need you to feel and believe that you are weak. They cut you off from reality as if you knew the truth you would have left a long time ago. Don't feel an ounce of sympathy for them, because they need to feed of you and your pain, pain that they create.\n\nA word of warning and caution... If they dump you because there is no more feed to be gained aka worthless or if you doorslam and you haven't crumpled up, are in the corner of a room in the fetal position because they aren't in your life then you are a threat.\n\nYou need them, right? And they have now deemed you worthless, so now without them how dare you be happy, move on and God forbid feel self worth! This will trigger the N and make them feel threatened an abandoned, for that you need to be destroyed. They might try and be nosy and get back in contact they want to know how or what you are doing to feel good without them so they can copy and be successful but not have the feelings but they would dump you again or they would hurt you again to bring you down to what they see as worthless. Think of an empty husk that a  spider has drained and dumped.\n\nThey might test you, and to see if your self image is strong but have no contact don't give them a chance.\n\nIf they feel threatened they might play games or try and turn people against you with lies and manipulation, and use their flying monkeys to do their bidding. Anything you ever said or did will be used against you. This is war, make no bones about it. When you opened up to them about fears, upsets and guilt this will be used against you. Even simple and innocent events or behavior will be twisted to fit their narrative and of course they can't be wrong can they?\n\nThey are deeply insecure of being wrong, not being good enough and rejected and are utterly terrified of being found out. So as you escape the mad house/Borg and know the truth you must be destroyed. You threaten their reality, their sense of self, you know the truth, you don't need them and you defied them by becoming free and having worth.\n\nN: Whhatt's this, I don't understand, I  dumped them because they are worthless, what are they doing ? Are they happy with out me? Impossible. How? They need me, they can't move on and not need me, they do what I want and I tell then how they should be/feel/do..\n\nYou can see how this really messes their delicate ego and they feel threatened and rejected.\n\nSorry to repeat a little but I'm editing on a phone and I had to rewrite bits because I thought this part was deleted. But it does work to reinforce what I've already written, so I have included it here:\n\nWord of warning though, once they have dumped them or you have cut them off/out, they won't like you being free and happy. They will see you as a threat, they will spread lies and try and destroy you because you are worthless and you need them right? How dare you do things without their permission, how dare you move on and be happy, ho dare you have worth or feel worthy when they have told you, you are worthless. Wwwhat's happening, this can't be right (feels rejected/threatened) Right that's it...destroy them. And they will try and turn others against you I'm afraid. The depths of their depravity know no ends, if people turn against you then they weren't true people and it makes door slamming easier as the NS little flying monkeys can go too.\n\nEverything you said or did will be used against you, even when you thought you trust them and opened up. Even simple innocent events will be demonized, the monster will try and paint you to others like what they are like inside (projecting themselves). \n\nHere's what I've written previously to other reddit users:\n\nThey are setting a trap, gauging your response... Are you eager? Are you still in their net? Are you going to follow them like a lost puppy and do the leg work for them and get in touch and continue the conversation, it's like a spider creating a web and asking the fly to come over, the fly follows or goes over because it's curious and naturally wants to follow the conversation/interaction that has been started by the spider. The spider starts like serving the ball in tennis, the fly naturally responds by hitting or responding, the spider knows this so leads the fly into his web, the fly is unaware until it is too late. The narcissist wants to know if it can get its fix from you so is in a roundabout way hoovering or should I say hovering about to see how you respond.\n\nDon't respond, you're walking into the spiders web.\n\nThey don't care, they have no feelings, they would only hurt, use and dump you again.\n\nIn response to someone wanting to write a letter to their N:\n\n\nYou might give them feed and open a gap for them to try and worm their way back. They have no feelings, they don't care so any response you get will either be fake or hurtful. Whatever happens you did not deserve their treatment. \n\n\nResponse to a person whose n keeps showing off about their new relationship:\n\nSit back and watch it all unfold.\n\nI said this because NS are stunted and incapable of change, so this relationship will end in flames so watch it burn.\n\nNS are losers, so let them be losers. Don't waste the pretty. Turn your back when you see them, ignore them and give them the cold shoulder. You are fabulous, you don't need them to happy, free and you do not need to give them the permission to dictate yourself worth. Don't give them the keys to your life. Slam that door and lock them out.\n\n\n",

He stalked me for a while after the official move out date, although there were no \"direct\" encounters so to speak. March of this year was when the divorce was official. For a while, I was going to a 12 step support group for a drinking problem. But I tended to get around people in those groups that were abusive, had a PD, or both. So I have stopped going to those groups. I am actually doing much better since I've left the group, so no worries on that front. \n\nHowever, the relationship with my Nex lasted almost 6 years. And I feel like after being away from him for over a year and a half, I should no longer be having problems. Before I met him I was relatively well adjusted and had no problem making or keeping friends/relationships and no problems with employment. I have just recently started back to the dating scene. It is painfully obvious to me that I am missing quite a few things in my life that normal people seem to have naturally. \n\n1. I am missing many acquaintances since I moved back to my hometown. I know some people that I grew up with but have been too embarrassed about everything that's happened since meet my Nex to really initiate any kind of contact with them. And I was using the support group as a social group instead of actually getting out and meeting people. I guess it felt safer in some ways than actually having to deal with people who I would just meet randomly.\n2. I have a sketchy job history over the last 2 years. Mainly due to the stalking (had to quit one job), my parents having me stay at home for a while, and a minor mental breakdown at the end of the divorce. I am now back in school. \n3. I have lost a lot of friendships from people that I knew in college, they moved away, I moved away, and then my Nex had me drop all communication with them for the time we were together. I have had one close friend throughout this and just reconnected with another. But I still feel pretty cut off from the people who I used to know. \n\nSo, I guess since I don't have these things it is actually really triggering in a lot of ways. Because when I met my Nex, he didn't have any of these things either. And I keep telling myself that the reasons that I don't have them are different from the reasons that he didn't have them. But I feel like I am just like him whenever I meet someone new or go on a date. I feel like by glossing over these things as I try to rebuild my life that I am in some way being like him. Even though I am not outright lying about why things in my life are the way they are, I feel like I am more like my Nex than I am these normal people I am meeting. In turn, it makes me feel really guilty whenever I have to leave out details or try to gloss over something. So basically meeting new people is a trigger, I think. Has anyone else experienced anything like this? ",

I see my name. The name given to me by my parents. It's an odd name from an odd culture, that is hard to pronounce in English, that is also composed of both my mother and my father's last names.\n\nBoth parents were Ns, both were violent in their own ways. I love neither of them. I suspect one is already died of old age, and the other will follow. I am not quite interested in finding out.\n\nMy blood relatives mean little to me. Neither parent did a very good job of helping to know my extended family, we lived in a town that was small and isolated from everywhere so I got to see a handful of them maybe once every 2 years... I don't know most of my blood family the way I would have liked to, which is the way an actual family (my chosen friends!) know each other. \n\nI tried going the genealogy route, when I was young and desperate for a family of any kind. But there are breaks in the lines on both sides, so nothing panned out. I found a few extended relatives... but they were so unlike the person I am, I felt no connection at all. I did not want to form a connection with these people either, I realized I wanted to leave them behind.\n\nIt's hard for me to open up to people because I feel so tied to my past, still, because of this stupid name. I feel afraid that people will Google me and find all the mistakes I made because of my struggles growing up in an abusive household, which left me incompetent during early adult life. I'm afraid people will find my old photos when I was a complete unhygienic overweight mess of a human being who could barely answer the phone without having an anxiety attack. There are TONS of bullies out there I couldn't fend off during gradeschool, during highschool and even college, I had always been an easy, impopular target. All of them could so easily find me through a past I want to let go of, and some are spiteful and hateful enough to try. Some would probably drop innocuous mean comments on social media if they found me. I have no social media to speak of, because I do not want to be found.\n\nThis has created hardship with employment. :(\n\nAt least soon I'll have a name I have chosen myself, which reflects a new beginning. Including a way to avoid being linked with my former self in the world of employment.\n\nI can finally put myself out there, truly, and also not be so afraid I'll be found out suddenly.\n\nI can finally complete my \"Physical Transformation\" which is basically dropping the last 15 pounds to my goal weight, and put on a LOT of muscle, and it won't be that \"old\" person doing it... it'll be *me*.\n\nWith my new name I'll be able to finally blend in... belong to the culture I've chosen. And at the very! least! people won't be struggling all the time to try to pronounce my name, and they won't be afraid of making a mistake and making me repeat it three times.\n\nI cannot wait for this to happen. This is going to be my birthday present to myself.",

She said that when I shared about the moment where I was holding my infant son and feeling that intense love and joy and thought to myself that if my parents loved me a 1/10th of what I felt for my son, they would have never done what they did, that she completely understood because she had the same thought with her son about her step dad. She believed every word I said.

Because in order to get angry I first needed to learn that I have self-worth, that my parents were wrong to teach me that my needs and expressions of self were wrong and unacceptable, that my childhood and family were not normal, that the way I was treated was not my fault or somehow inevitable because there was something wrong with me. \n\nBefore, I felt cheated and robbed. I felt sad and upset. But I wasn't angry yet. Now I've learned to take care of myself and to care about myself. I've learned to ask for and accept help. Lately I've experienced suicidal feelings yet again (I have them a lot and therapy taught me to cope with them and get through them but I'm not sure I'll ever just stop having them). No plans or intentions, just feelings.\n\nI told my employer, because my job has to do with mental health and suicide prevention, there's a lot of support available and they're big on helping people cope and avoiding vicarious trauma - they have been supportive and enormously helpful. I realised that if I had that help when I was young I wouldn't have ended up like this. If I could have told someone when I was unhappy and have them react with care and concern I wouldn't have tried to take my own life as a teenager and I wouldn't have had to unlearn my belief that help is for other people.\n\nDiscovering that I really can get a human and caring reaction in my darkest times, it's like it has cracked something open and anger is pouring out. I'm angry that I have to live with complex PTSD symptoms. That my life history led to money problems which mean I don't have savings or a pension. That I tried to take my own life and nobody cared. I think it's probably about time I got angry with someone other than myself.\n\n(Please don't post any advice about money, or tell me to take responsibilty (I am), or make assumptions about the quality of my therapy because I still have suicidal feelings.

        "text": "I was married to a person who checks all the boxes for Narcissism (never an official diagnosis) for 5 years. During that time, he brainwashed me, isolated me from my family by making up fake reasons to cut them off, and also isolated me from friends. He led me to believe that there was something wrong with me. My self-esteem was in the gutter, he knew I always struggled with issues of self-confidence, and would constantly tear me down. I had been very close to my family my entire life (nobody's perfect, of course!) so I believe I got PTSD after he made me cut off my last sibling.\n\n\nI was also spiritually abused: he used the Bible to manipulate me (loved the parts about the wife submitting, but ignored the parts about how the husband is supposed to love the wife). The only emotions he showed were fear and anger. I was only allowed to express emotions that he approved of. Prior to marrying this guy, I was decently emotionally healthy and had a lot of feelings and processed through them in ways that were healthy and helpful for me. During the marriage, I was emotionally stifled. I used to keep a journal and I would write a lot of things down, but I typically don't write down the painful things because I don't like to remember them, so I too became emotionally stunted like he was. I was also afraid of processing through the hurt he caused because he used the Bible to lead me to believe that Divorce was some ultimate sin.\n\n\nI filed for divorce several months ago and the one-year mark of mandatory separation is coming up in the next few weeks. I am physically free, but the effects of his psychological, emotional, and spiritual abuse are very present. (I am seeing a therapist weekly, but if I could afford it I would see the therapist 2-3 time a week for all the crap I have to deal with.)\n\n\n**My question is:** Those of you who have gone through similar experiences of isolation at the hands of a partner, how did you work through the triggers of PTSD and anxiety? How did you become able to recognize that you were having anxiety and PTSD episodes as they were happening, and not hours/days later?",

        "text": "I know a lot of you have been following the drama with our day care providers. All we had to do was get through this week and we were off to bigger, better things. \n\nToday they told us they were closed tomorrow (our last day) due to illness and needing to sanitize everything. I was instantly mad bc I cannot miss this important meeting tomorrow or can i afford to pay for other care when I already paid for that day. Granted, i know I'm on a hair trigger with these people. \n\nSo I was able to arrange alternative care and i asked the soon to be former day care ladies to have everything ready to go since today was now our last day. I have been nothing but professional with them all week despite wanting to scream, yell and curse at them. I then asked for a refund of $50 for tomorrow since it was our last day given the situation. We now have to pay higher fees for day care and registration fees due to their decision to kick my 3 yro out of daycare for being 3. \n\n(Quick recap- he did typical 3 yro things like testing boundaries, trying to see how lying worked, blaming other kids for his behavior etc and they said \"they never seen anything like it\" and even harped ok him for sucking his thumb. They insinuated that he was malicious and evil and shrugged when I told them that his pediatrician, my therapist and every teacher &amp; mental health professional I know said it's typical behavior for this age. He's had a lot to deal with in 6 months and instead of teaching him and helping him grow? They singled him out and punished him for it. It was too hard and they gave up on him bc he wouldn't just sit quiet and jump when they said jump. My kid isn't perfect and I'm not a perfect parent but come on. He's three and has been through a lot!)\n\nAnyways- I asked for a reasonable refund and they said no. I didn't accept that answer and told them it's the least they could do considering the position their choice put us in. They said we could discuss it when I picked them up. So fast forward and I go and get my kids. I grab their stuff and get them in the car. When I get there, they have one of the grandpas of one of the kids there like he was waiting/ready to protect them. What in the hell did they think I was going to do? But whatever. I asked to speak to them outside in private where I could see my kids in the car. I didn't want them to hear the interaction. \n\nThey tried to tell me they wouldn't give me the $ bc they didn't play favorites and it was in the contract. That they would then have to give it to everyone. I said I understood that but this is a different situation and I could argue they breached the contract by not providing adequate care for my children. I went and explained how they continuously put their needs before my kids' needs and gave examples. They tried to tell me I was wrong with each one and refused to give me the money. I told them that I hope they reconsider because I have other options I don't want to resort to but will. I told them that since they get most of their business from word of mouth, I had no qualms going on social media and giving their business a review. I also had to qualms about going to the local and national/local paper and telling them about how they treated my children and made him sleep in a bathroom bc he kept waking up the other kids (which at time I thought was true. My husband had told me they told him that. I've since learned that my son told my husband that but the point is the same-they singled out and punished my kid instead of teaching him the right way to behave- I.e. Their job while he's with them).  They eventually wrote me a check. She made a point to tell me it was just to have this ended and not because she thinks she did anything wrong. \n\nThey also tried to tell me that there was nothing wrong with my kid, it was just that his behavior was effecting the other kids. This is not what they said last week or any other time. I also gave them a three page letter about my grievances and how they failed my children. They backtracked left and right and wouldn't take responsibility.  I didn't tell, threaten violence or scream. My voice was shaky because I was so upset. I wouldn't accept their crap. \n\nEveryone says I did the right thing-even with the threats to expose them but I feel crummy. I'm proud of myself for defending my kids and doing it in a way where they can learn something positive ( we discussed it in broad terms on the way home) but I feel like I stooped low with the threats. I feel like I'm not better than my nparents. I hear their voices saying \"you're throwing a tantrum because you didn't get what you wanted\" \"you just did it for the money!\"\n\nI know these things aren't true. I know it was a business transaction for a false bill of goods. I just hate that I was put in a position where my two choices were to lie down and take it or to use these \"tools.\"  I also don't like giving anyone any reason to support claims of any negative thought about me. I so recognize that as a flea. I have just worked so hard to put positivity out there than I hate when I've put negativity out there. I'm sick to my stomach. \n\nI'm trying to focus on the fact that I stood up for my kids and defended them and their interests. My parents did not do that unless it was for their interests. And maybe that's where I'm struggling since I got $50 out of it :-/ (but not enough to return it. We are broke and have big expenses coming up and I need it for daycare tomorrow with our new lady for my infant. Found a great preschool for my toddler who actually knows how to work with kids his age and who are gifted like he is). \n",

        "text": "So I moved out in July hoping that things would steadily improve and have only found them to get worse and worse.\n\nI mean, things were good for a while. New city, new friends, new adventures, but it seems that no matter how much effort i put into getting better i keep falling again and again.\n\nI recently quit my job because of the anxiety and had to drop out of school. I've spent the last 3 weeks not really leaving the apartment. I discussed some of this with my therapist and she mentioned that the lack of energy I've been feeling is a result of pretty severe depression. I've been feeling like this since like 2014, if not earlier.\n\nThe anxiety that is automatically triggered by even the smallest of events makes it hard to seek social support, which leads to isolation and depression, which leads to decreased energy and functioning and pretty much wreaks havoc on the rest of my life.\n\nI'm currently exercising daily, meditating for 5-30 minutes a day, doing CBT, fairly good diet, taking all sorts of supplements and receive therapy once a week and I'm still struggling. \n\nI'm basically at the end of my rope here and feel some serious burnout. All of this may even make me homeless in the next few weeks and I'm even contemplating suicide because I can't really see any of this getting better.",

        "text": "Hi! I'm new to reddit and to this sub. A quick background: I'm DoNF, 33, married and a mom to my six-year-old son.\n\nI've had no contact with my Ndad, and his enablers; my sister and stepmom for almost a year now. My biological mom divorced my dad years ago, he was physically and emotionally abusive towards her. (My mom and I have a good relationship and does support me not having contact with my Ndad.) My Ndad has been emotionally abusive towards me my whole life, (manipulative/controlling/gaslighting) and I'm still dealing with the aftermath that comes from walking away from that whole situation. Mind you, my Ndad is basically a non-racist version of Trump. The same energy, the same misogyny, bullying tactics to get what he wants. He even calls himself \"the King\" because he believes he's always right. He genuinely believes he's the best thing since apple pie and sliced bread, and he enjoys kicking you down when you're at your worst. Before cutting contact, he was asking me nearly every time I saw him if I was pregnant (mind you, I am plus sized, but not to the point where that was a question needing to be asked every time I saw him), or the time where he flat out told me he \"didn't see what how my boyfriend and I connected over\" - and then asked me what my boyfriend (who is now my husband) saw in me. I feel utterly worthless and ashamed of myself around Ndad; he's conditioned me (over the years) to feel as if I'm a waste of time, that he (and everyone else) has/had something more important to do. Even to my Estepmom, who told me (as a 31 year old, after I left my son's father -who is another N) that I was a \"weak woman\", that I'd flock to \"anyone nice\" because I hadn't \"known a lot of nice in my life\". (This was in reference to why my husband and I got together in the first place, according to her, I only stayed with my husband because he was \"nice\" to me.) Gee, I wonder why that was the case?!\n\nSo my question is this: what books can be recommended to assist in healing from that kind of emotional abuse? I do have a good support system now, but I'm still struggling on a day-to-day basis. I'm still apologizing for everything, and there's a bit of anxiety that's ensued because I can't get out of that \"waiting for the other shoe to drop\" mentality. I am currently seeking a therapist for this (all I can afford is the in-network for my insurance), but in the meantime, I thought I could try my hand at some self help and jump start into a healthier life.\n\nThank you for taking your time in reading this and if you do make a suggestion, it is very much appreciated. Thank you again.",

Finding the class took a lot of mental effort, it took a lot of physical effort to find clothes that fit and to drive my ass all the way over there and it was emotionally and physically taxing to participate.  I'm glad I did, I think.\n\nThere were a couple older teens there, like 8-10 years younger than me.  They were awkward, aggressive and liked to show off... normal teenagers.  Then, there was me.  Then, there were 2 instructors 8-10 years older than me.  So I'm not gonna lie, I felt weird about the dynamic.\n\nMy stamina is shitty.  I was out of breath for some of the more mundane stuff we were doing.  And then I looked like an incompetent fool during other mock fight sessions.  One of the things I hate more than anything is appearing stupid to other people or like I'm an idiot in general.  I know for a fact that's how I was looking for a portion of the class.\n\nThese 2 young dudes showed me up multiple times.  They obviously have had practice in the stuff we were doing, but it definitely didn't make me feel better about myself.\n\nIt was completely out of my comfort zone, which is what I needed I think.  The energy, the environment, the subject matter, the physicality of the self defense class... it was WAY out of my comfort zone.\n\nThe instructors want to see me back, so I guess I'll try it again.  I'm not a quitter, I just don't want to look so dumb in front of so many people.\n\nSo, obviously, this is a rant and if y'all have any advice to offer, I'm open.  I feel like with my narc parents, I didn't have normal formative years.  This is something that I probably would've done as a younger man if I could have had the foresight for it.",

Charming, sensative, listened to me, told me how awesome I was.\n\n4 years and two kids later, he would gaslight. Nothing was ever his fualt(throughout his whole life, not just with me.) I was the irrational one, I was the one who was neglecting him. I was controlled, not allowed to go out, go to school, hold a job.\n\nI spent all my time cooking and cleaning and raising our kids while he played video games and if I tried to communicate, I spent the next 3-4 days not talking to anyone because he would 'shut down.'\n\nWhen I asked to go to marraige counseling, he said if thats how I felt, \"It was already over.\"\n\nI began working out and loving myself and I left.\n\nOf course, IM the monster for leaving.\n\nI started with nothing. A job I had for 2 months, a truck that would break down 2 weeks later, and crashing on couches while he kept the house and car and berated me for 'leaving the kids.'\n\nA year later, new car, great job, new boyfriend(who was an old friend of mine), awesome credit score, 50/50 time with the children, we finalized the divorce with everything in his favor because I wasn't 'recovered'. I was still scared of him. I still believed his lies and threats.\n\nAnother year has passed and after several empty threats to take me to court, after refusing to cooperate or work towards the best interest of the children, I made the first move to file a modification. We are going back to court. I am seeking sole legal custody and have a file full of his angry rants, him putting the kids second to his needs, him trying to control me to give to the judge. He dug his own hole hoping I would be scared and back down and give into his demands.\n\nI also stopped replying to him. I only reply if it is in regards to the kids. I keep it brief. Business like. I ignore his snarky insults, him trying to shift blame onto me.\n\nI actually laughed in his face the last time he tried to insult me or threaten me, and I could see him boiling with rage,\n\nI am in control now, he no longer scares me.\n\nHe is the one who is unstable, miserable, and alone.\n\nI go to bed every night knowing I am loved, supported, and a good person.\n\nHe has NOTHING over me and it is the BEST feeling and it is driving him INSANE to realize I simply DO NOT CARE about him anymore.\n\nHe can pitch a fit and throw a tantrum and say whatever he wants to about me and it's all just so damn funny to me. I can't believe I ever believed his threats. I cant believe I ever thought he could be a decent person for his kids.\n\nThing is about a narssicist once they lose their power over you, once you are no longer afraid, once you recognize the disordered behavior for what it is, they become so pathetically predictable it's almost amusing.\n\nHowever I've got better things to do than be amused or frustrated by the pathetic behavior, or worry about how it might harm my kids.\n\nAll I can do is love my children, show them how a stable family operates, enjoy my husband and my evenings and my peace. I'm not renting out any head space to him anymore. Let him do everything he can to get a reaction out of me.....Ive got an actual, meaningful life to live.\n\nAt the end of the day, being happy, not caring, and keeping my focus on what truelly matters to me is the BEST REVENGE.\n\nIt will happen. Maybe years after you leave them, but it is possible to move on and enjoy your life!",

She had a severely disabled daughter that kept her from working and I would pay her to clean my house or watch my son here and there to help out with some extra money. She was always there if I needed her and I tried to be for her too. I remember visiting her in the hospital last year when she got an infection in her knee. I hadn't seen her in ages but I brought her lunch and kept her company. I genuinely liked and cared about her even if we didn't talk much or see each other much. \n\nI had no idea she was an addict and I still don't know what her substance of choice was or if this was on purpose or not. She looked happy and healthy. I'm still blown away and shocked at her passing. I cried my whole way into work and was a zombie all day. \n\nI decorated my house tonight with my family and i kept thinking \"she doesn't get to do this any more.\" And it broke my heart. I don't even know if her daughter will understand bc of her severe disability. I don't know what's happening with her-I assume her family will care for her. It's a lifelong commitment because of her disability. She can't do much on her own. \n\nI just had to share. Process. I'm just flabbergasted and heartbroken. ",

        "text": "Ever since I went NC 2.5 years ago, the holidays have been extra hard for me (&amp; the one that started the eventual downfall of it all sucked massively. So basically every holiday since my eldest was born ha been hard-but each gets better). \n\nHolidays and birthdays were the only days where my family kinda acted like a family. It's when my nfather tended to be more gregarious and everyone \"seemed\" happy. Now don't get me wrong, there was a lot of nstrings and guilt that I see now. But still, since cutting off contact, the holidays are hard and don't feel as special. Honestly the only special about it are my kids and that's what I focus on. \n\nWe were driving home from thanksgiving from my inlaws (whom always go out of the way for me because they know how fucked is my childhood was) and I was telling my husband, while it was a nice day and enjoyable with family, it never fills that hole leftover from my childhood. It never scratches that \"holiday nostalgia\" comfort itch. \n\nAnd that's when I realized it was about the comfort which made me realize it was about safety and more. The traditions I had growing up, the tchotchkes, the excitement about driving somewhere distant for the holiday- all of it were comforts to me that somewhat scratch that itch (but not completely). But they aren't comforts, are they? They were safe things. They happened every year, more or less, and I could count on them unlike my family. I knew every year we decorated for the holidays the weekend right after thanksgiving even if I never knew what mood my nfather would be in. These traditions I could count on like clockwork. \n\nWhen you think of Maslow's hierarchy of needs, right above your physical needs, is safety. It comes before everything else after physical needs. And we never really did feel safe growing up did we? So we look for things that are consistent and remind us that we are safe. To me it was those holiday traditions, those tchotchkes, &amp; even that potato dish or special pie made only for holidays. So now, now that I am safe, when I go to recreate them, they don't satisfy that need anymore. They aren't comforts anymore. They aren't safe anymore. In fact, those goddamned favorite potatoes of mine make me so fucking sad. \n\nI realized that these comforts, these safeties- make me realize what I am missing even more than on regular days. They make me sad and grieve more. \n\n I honestly don't know where to go from here. I am making new traditions with my family, but those take years to become traditions, safety and comforts. And my husband keeps trying to make those potatoes that make me sad. My MIL keeps trying to make it special for me, but it's just not the same. And it's neither them. It's all me. I appreciate what they do for me beyond words, but I'm the one with the massive hole that I have to figure out how to heal. \n\nBut this revelation is a huge step forward. And my husband is actually planning on decorating tomorrow, so that helps too. Maybe doing those old traditions my way now is a step forward. ",

        "text": "So, I declared Chpt 13 bankruptcy about a year ago. I have 4 more years left on it, so I don't have to worry about my student loans for quite a while. Still, when I come out of this, I would like to be able to manage my student loans without breaking NC.\n\nI will almost certainly need to negotiate down payments on my student loans after my Chpt 13 ends. The payments are so high that I would technically need to be making 6 figures in order for them to be \"affordable\". But, on most of my loans, my parents are my cosigners. Therefore, I will need their help to negotiate payments down, ranging from a form to just a signature. (Well, officially I need this. Last time, my dad refused to fill out the required form, although he signed it, and they accepted it anyway. I can't expect that they'll accept a blank form twice, and, still, his signature requires some contact with him.)\n\nI'm NC, and have been for about a year. I can guarantee you that, after 5 years of NC, if I need my parents' help to negotiate my student loans, they will milk the hell out of it, and make it as hellish for me as possible. I thought about faking their signatures, but I don't think I could fake all the info. Their signatures are extremely tough to copy, too. Also, by that time, if I haven't been in contact with them in 5 years, this will be quite obvious if anyone ever bothered to look into it.\n\nI have a combination of both private and federal student loans. Previously I only had heard of companies that refinanced federal loans, but I'm hearing about some now that will refinance all your loans, private and federal, into a single lump sum and single payment. If I can get an equivalent and/or lower rate, would it be worth it to do this, both to simplify my loans, and to get my parents off of them?\n\nAlso, taking into account, since my bankruptcy, and, more importantly, since NC, I've been doing much better financially. I expect to be able to make monthly payments in 4 years, just not the huge sum that would be required of me without any sort of help or negotiation. I've been easily making my monthly payments to my trustee, as required by my Chpt 13.\n\nAlso, another reason I'd want to refinance with a new company is just... triggers. I did a lot of my education for the wrong reasons. The reason I took out so much was because I didn't understand what was going on, and I was trying to flee abusive situations without any help from anyone. So, making all these payments every month was really emotionally hard. Each student loan company reminded me of a separate set of traumas. ",

        "text": "So we made all those changes at home to help improve my son's behavior (he's almost 4). And we saw a huge improvement right away. Day care did too. He still had hiccups but over all it was better. We've stuck with the changes for the most part and he's behaving better for us at home. The last week or so, they started saying he was acting up a bit here and there. But still, in my mind, better. My anxiety very slowly receding. \n\nToday they told me that he hasn't been good at all. That he won't listen, is defiant on purpose, willful, and won't follow directions. They say he does a lot of attention speaking behaviors like whining, crying, etc. One of the two daycare ladies (&amp; she just had a baby and took like No time off) said that he will do whatever he wants, when he wants. She said he doesn't seem to care or to respect her. He will have a grin on his face like he doesn't care and knows what he's doing. When she was talking to me about it this afternoon, he started sucking his thumb and she said \"see! Like that! He never sucks his thumb during the day! Only after you get here!\" And then he smiled at her because she was giving him attention and she jumped on that, pointing out that the smile he apparently does. She also said she's never seen a kid act like this and she's stumped at what to do. She started to question if it's a good fit (&amp; of course my stomach dropped bc of the terrible nanny drama we've had). \n\nI see some of these behaviors at home but nothing I'd say wasn't age appropriate. All of my child development books and what I've found online say this is total normal 3.5 yro behavior and that it's quite specific to this age. All my mental health, teacher, veteran mom friends and child care friends say the same. \n\nAdditionally, he does do very well in preschool 3 mornings a week. He's beyond his age and even the almost 5 yro kid. He's always been crazy smart. I did some research and I think he may be gifted. I'm gonna ask the pediatrician for a referral to get him tested. \n\nSo I'm sharing all this because my first reaction was \"this is all my fault. I'm a terrible parent. I've given my kid ODD.\" I believed everything they said. I agreed with them more or less. It took all I had to not have a panic attack right there bc it massively triggered my PTSD. I thought about it all the way home. I talked to my husband about it. I started to get angry. Yes my kid isn't perfect, but for god sakes he's only 3! He doesn't understand the concept of respect! I think she has unreasonable expectations for him and is punishing him for it. He's the eldest there 90% of the time by almost 2 years. The only other kid who is older is the little boy who comes For preschool 3x a week. I think they expect him to jump every time they say jump. They expect him to be obedient 24-7. That's not my kid. I don't want to \"break him in\"\nOr break his will. That will serve him well as an adult. We don't spank. Im adamantly against that personally. I am big on expectation, boundaries &amp; age appropriate consequences. Maybe it takes longer but that's ok. I'm teaching him. I have patience. And yes he does like to run off to what he's interested in, but like I said he's 3, high spirited and probably gifted!!\n\nThe more I thought about what she said, the more angry I got. There have been a few times where they've made decisions with out consulting me. Like when they decided to up my infants formula intake and didn't discuss it with me. Or when they changed her nap schedule to fit their needs and didn't discuss it with me. Or told me I need to feed her before dropping them off (even though they cover all the feedings ) bc they didn't have time to spoon feed her in the am. \n\nThere have been so many other wonderful positives that I let these things go. I also recognize that I may be transferring and or triggered bc she's former military and my nfather was too. That's a trigger of mine. But something hasn't been totally settled this whole time. I thought it was just my anxiety not\nGoing down from our experience before. And I could be overreacting now. \n\nSo now i think we need to find an alternative. I think my son needs an all day preschool with kids his own age. Unfortunately the one near our house and on my way to work doesn't take infants. So idk what I'm gonna do. \n\nAnyways I got off track. The point was I blamed myself first and went through everything I did wrong. I took full responsibility when, after processing, it's really more her than me or my kid. So im pissed and frustrated!\n\nUPDATE: First of all, you guys are awesome. Thank you. Its been rough because my kids is a major mine zone of triggers for me (not them specifically but anyone who threatens them/their wellbeing, etc.). \n\nSo, they did kick my 3.5 yro out of day care yesterday. I realized that all the issues fundamentally boiled down to them consistently putting their needs ahead of my children's-both kids, though it effected my 3.5 yro more. We toured two day care centers and they can take them immediately. Its just $300-$400 more every two weeks than what we are currently paying. So goodbye steaks, hello ramen. But they have an amazing perk program and teachers specifically trained to work with kids his age. I also wrote a letter to them about everything. I am still editing it, but I think I will give it to them on the last day next week. They need to hear how they fucked up, but I will do it in a professional manner.  Thanks for all the support. You guys really rock!",

        "text": "In recent weeks I posted twice about my NDad, and I feel like I'll get dizzy from flip-flopping so hard. First [I thought about wheither it might be possible to have an actual relationship with him](https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/5832r1/how_to_relate_to_ndad_after_the_abuse_seems_to/), then, after [not hearing anything from him on my birthday](https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAfterNarcissism/comments/5bhvzx/how_to_react_to_ndads_behaviour_that_is_almost/), I was already making plans on how to handle a possibly happening blow-out and subsequent NC. I was expecting him to be punishingly silent because of something I did which I wasn‘t aware of, or angry because the rest of my family was visiting me and he wasn‘t, or maybe because our last contact was 2 weeks before my birthday and it was mostly about what present I wanted, and he was feeling used financially (while I was just really busy with work).  \n  \nThe latter things turned out (probably, if I trust his word) to not be the case, but I was really, really, REALLY worried, if not panicking, searching for explanations...  \n  \nIt turned out - he did send a package for me, which would have arrived on time, but the postal service fucked it up, and it arrived 5 days late. After the fourth day my father and I had a short text exchange, which was the first time I heard from him and knew for sure that he actually sent something.  \n  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n  \nThe phone conversation I had with him after the package finally arrived went something like this:  \n  \nMe [after thanking him for the present, which was pretty much exactly what I asked for], not accusingly: „Nevertheless, it would have been nice to hear from you on my birthday.“   \n  \nHim, slightly defensive: „Hm. Oh. Well, it was already embarrassing enough to have called your brother the day before when you [meaning me, my brother, my mother, from whom he is divorced, and her parents] were all together, I didn‘t want to do that to myself. And I thought the card in the package would suffice.“  \n  \nMe, explaining rather than accusing: „But since the package didn‘t arrive on time, I didn‘t hear anything from you, and wondered wheither you forgot my birthday or ignored it and worried about what might be going on. That was not cool.“ [which was sugar-coating it – I was full on dissociating the 3rd day in, despite my best attempts to manage my fears…]  \n  \nHim, astonished, but actually apologetic: „Huh. I‘m sorry. I‘ll try and call the next time.“  \n  \nMe, in amiable conclusion: „Yes, I would like that.“  \n  \n[moving on to other things, and he apologized several times more in the subsequent conversation]  \n  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n  \nI still find his „embarrassment“ a bad excuse, that belies his weak empathy towards me and him projecting his own bad feelings about my mother and her family onto them, because when they met in the past, there was nothing but (cool) politeness from their side, no actual conflict or accusations (anymore). But still, it‘s more about his own fear of rejection and possibly guilt, not really malignant and certainly not as bad as I feared it would be, as far as reasons for his behaviour go.  \n  \n\nBut now I‘m sitting here and don‘t really know what to think about the whole episode.  \nI know that my fears about him turning hostile were probably unfounded in the present, but they ARE founded in the past, and are not there because I am batshit crazy, but because in the past, something bad would have been likely to happen.  \n  \nBut what does this disparity tell me? Probably that something changed. The question is – what did change? Or even – what is/was his underlying mental problem/disorder? Because that tells me a lot about what would even be possible to change…  \n  \nDoes he suffer from actual clinical NPD?  \nIs it more something along the lines of BorderlinePD?  \nOr is it rather a severe case of C-PTSD? His own undoubtedly traumatic childhood with his own NMom makes that a possibility – and according to Pete Walker, the border between a certain subtype of C-PTSD and NPD is regularly blurred.  \nOr maybe it is just really, really bad FLEAs from his mom?   \n  \nAll these possible explanations offer different views on what could have changed and how stable that change is, but I really try to avoid doing this - diving into what I know of his mind and history and try to work out empathetically what the hell is up with him. Which is something I did since childhood, when I tried to make sense of his abusive behaviour towards me, and trying to predict it, and it fucked me up majorly.  \n  \nBut I also feel like I really need a solid answer to this. I need to make sense of how things were, to make sense of how things are now. Because like this, I am completely at a loss – should I protect myself, or am I overguarded where it isn‘t necessary (anymore), and thus robbing myself of a good experience?  \n  \nThis really screws with my head regarding my memories, too. It would be so much easier if my father was still a choleric, passive-aggressive, all-critizising, out-lashing asshole narcissist. Then I would KNOW that I‘m on the right track, that I named him rightly and had the right to cut myself loose. It would be a good narrative, it would make SENSE.  \n  \nNow I feel more like being showed the promise of, if not an actual father-daughter-relationship, at least something like peaceful co-existence without having to warp myself beyond recognition, and that sounds fine to me. But I can‘t shake the feeling that it‘s a trap, that it isn‘t true, that I can‘t trust it.  \n  \nAnd I don‘t feel like as if I can really stop warping myself around him, either – to present an image that can not be attacked, to do my utmost so he won‘t feel threatened and lash out, to keep the peace. I also recognize that I did use that kind of „diplomacy“during our phone call I described earlier, and I wonder how necessary that was.  \n  \nIt‘s just all so uncertain, and knowing the possible toll just doing the trial/error-thing could have on my mental health, I don‘t really want to try until I am FAR more stable, and  possibly not even then.  \n  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n  \nI‘m not really sure what I want by posting this. I think that maybe it is too individual a case to fit in the big patterns that this community recognized and named, maybe I just can't see it because I‘m too involved. If you have advice, it is very welcome.  \n  \nBut I definitely wanted to share and tell people who might be interested how it worked out.  \n  \nAnyway, thanks for reading!\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Hey LANners!\n\nHaven't posted in a while since I started therapy in June...but it's gone quite well; I sharpened the scope from \"Nmom and Me\" to \"similarly-affected wife and me\" and got a lot of good insights as far as how living with NMom as the only voice in my head has injured me and my marriage (hint: behavior patterns learned under a willfully-single parent who expects you to be their offensive line, fullback, personal/executive assistant, interference runner against society, sounding board, and mini-me DO NOT WORK with a spouse who didn't grow up similarly situated. I'm finally seeing that, 17 years in.)\n\nNow, the seventh anniversary of the worst week of my life-- from my mom's death on Nov. 28 to her funeral Dec. 4-- is around the corner. My therapist has had me working on vulnerability issues (NMom was well-known for her emotional **in**vulnerability, and passed that down to me...another bad trait for a marriage where the other partner is almost *too* vulnerable), including writing a love letter to my wife...in which some stuff even she didn't know about was revealed. With said anniversary coming up, I feel like it's a good time to confront my late NMom, essentially saying everything I never did when she was alive (she prized loyalty to her over everything, brooked no dissent, and didn't always reward the sacrifices others-- including me-- made in her service). She is the biggest part of my past; with her long-dead, I feel like I need to put her away if I'm going to move forward.\n\nHere's the rub: Her headstone-- my most (pun intended) symbol/ reminder of her-- is 1400 miles away, and I have no money or time to fly East to spend time with it (plus it's the quickest way for me to piss off/worry my wife, making it more trouble than it's worth) for the anniversary. Since I can't have one last closure-achieving day of rage in front of her grave (her headstone has her image flash-printed on it), what are some other good ways I can finally put her to rest?\n\nP.S. I didn't notice it before, but [this song](https://youtu.be/dVVZaZ8yO6o) mostly speaks the feelings I'd express. \n\n",

        "text": "I'm on mobile, so I'm sorry for any typos or formatting issues.\n\nI guess I can start talking about this now, as I've escaped.\n\n First, this is the second time he did this to me and my son. The first time (2013 or 14) we had just gotten engaged.  When he threw us out, I didn't understand. I couldn't.  How could someone who made me believe I was the best in the world, who made me feel so loved, suddenly disappear.  Today, I understand that this overwhelming show of affection is called love bombing, which is a common tactic of narcissists. Then, I blamed myself for him being gone.  In my mind it was because I was sick a lot, or I have a son, or I was too distracted from those things and earning my MA to give him the attention and love he needed. He threw us out with the trash.\n\n I sunk so low in to depression. Lower than I ever have. For three months, I waited by the phone, I puked constantly (I lost 90 pounds), popped pills and stared out the window. I cried and smoked. That is all I did. I whispered, \"I love you\" everynight before bed like he was still there, and I dreamed about him. \n\n I called him constantly for help, because I didn't have anybody else, and I still held on to his promise that he would always care about me and be my friend. After all, I rationalized I would do it for him or anybody else I cared for (in fact I did. He would call me when he was feeling \"insecure\" around people.) Each time he didn't pick up, or picked up sounding annoyed I would sink lower. Over the three months I attempted several times to pull myself out of it. Each time I would come close he would pop back in my life and emotionally manipulate me in some way. For example, send me emails where he was angry about things I didn't do (like cheat on him), which made me feel bad that I had failed him in some way (one of my goals in our relationship was to show him that not all girls cheat, to help him trust again...in fact the fact that I never cheated on him was something I took pride in). Today, I know he did that because he needed to create lies to keep him from feeling remorse for what he did to us. Narcissists can never do wrong after all.\n\n Or tell me he missed me and cared after 6 or so weeks, and then use me for sex for two weeks and then leave. Many times I told him didn't want sex...I just wanted him in my life as a friend (I even cried during sex), but he convinced me he could only be my friend if we had sex. I tried to cut him off, but remember he had emotionally abused me, manupilated and silenced me so much during our \"relationship\" that I thought it was my fault and I deserved it.\n\nWhile I will never be able to forget that part of my life....my biggest nightmare inducing regret is what it did to my son. He had to watch his strong mother fall apart. I was his world...and suddenly I couldn't even stand on my  own. He spent an entire summer inside, eating pizza for every meal. He watched it all, and he knew a man he loved was responsible. And he was scared. And I will always hate part of myself for not being stronger and recognizing the abuse earlier. \n\nMostly I hate myself for, and feel embarrassed about the fact that I let him (my ex) back in and he did it to us again. While I am not suffering emotionally like before, my son and I are in a worse financial situation, because of it. And every day is a struggle, and we are scared.\n\nI can't talk anymore about this right now.  Maybe more later.\n\n\n",

If he started being a dick to me I'd hang up the phone. If he tried to grab and shake me or twist my arm around my back like he used to I'd hurt him. When I was living at home as an adult, if he got aggressive and weird I could just peace the fuck out. He soon stopped trying to start arguments with me (that I could never win) because I'd just walk out the door. \n\n\nEveryone expects me to forgive him- they treat it as a given that I'll be cool with him now, especially since he does nice things like send me fancy beer, but I don't want to. If I told the truth I'd be told I was being petty. But I fucking know what this guy is like when given the chance, and honestly it doesn't matter that he'll never have that chance again. I still don't like him. \n\n\nIn less coherent terms, I fucking *told* him this when I was about 11. That I wasn't going to forget that this was how he was when there were no consequences. And it turns out, I really didn't. His chill-ness seems so hollow to me because I know it's just because he knows he HAS to be to keep me in his life. It's not what he'd do if he thought he had a choice. \n\n\nI don't fucking know. There's this nagging doubt that I'm just being petty. But I really feel like I know what he's like in the dark. ",

I never told any of them where I work. Well, earlier this afternoon my office phone rings and a familiar number displays- Nmom's cell number. I talked to the receptionist about it since it was a transferred call. She said that she won't answer a number that shows up as unknown, which Nmom's did. Nmom leaves a voicemail about trying to contact someone here. The receptionist returns her call, Nmom says she wants to wish her daughter happy birthday so she's forwarded to my phone. My phone displays the actual number which I recognize so I don't answer. Thankfully she didn't leave a voicemail. \n\nShe left another voicemail on the receptionist line saying who she talked to, that she called to talk to her daughter but she didn't get through and the extension she was given didn't work (she wasn't given my extension), if someone could please call her back. I'm pretty sure the receptionist won't be returning her calls, not after I told her that Nmom is persona non grata. \n\nI'm trying not to let it bug me but this pissed me off! The day had been going fairly well until that point- busy, hectic, but good. Now I'm wondering if she somehow found out about my transfer next year, which will put me 1500+ miles away (Nmom lives less than 5 miles away which is its own awful story). I'm not worried about her following me to my transfer location since she can't handle money and is a perpetually broke moocher. I'm worried that she may start amping up with the crazy until it's time to move, which is still about 4 to 7 months away. \n\nEverything is always about them. She knows I want nothing to do with her, but still just wants to wish her daughter happy birthday, is that so much to ask for? Yes, because this is my birthday, not hers, and I don't want her birthday wishes. We all know it's not that simple- it's never that simple.\n\nUpdate: My office number must have shown up on Nmom's cell because she called my office phone directly a few minutes ago. Thankfully I wasn't in my office when she called, but even if she calls back, her call will be diverted.\n\nUpdate #2: She just called again- I diverted the call. Bitch get the message I don't want to talk to you! She left me a long freaking voicemail- \"it feels like it's my birthday, too, please call me, please talk to me, etc.\" as pathetically as possible.

And maybe some of us are familiar with this..dynamic? \n\nThis is for those of us with sibling(s)...\nhave any of you experienced any form of scapegoating? \n\nI'm new to this group. so a brief bit about me...\n\nI'm the oldest of 3 siblings (all adults now btw). Our parents, whose tumultuous marriage ended when I was 11, both had strong N traits. I won't go into detail now. \n\nFocusing on the present, here's my current issue. I want for the three of us siblings to have a solid relationship. Unfortunately, both parents at different times, have framed me as the rebellious one. I defended myself against father's abuse as an adolescent. And with my mother who didn't fight to see me as an adolescent, I refused to play games. I've been scapegoated. I've always been expressive and creative, in spite of their controlling ways. So today, I see it in how everyone in my family relates to me. No one takes me seriously. \n\nThat's my current family situation. \n\nCan anyone relate? And how have you handled it with your siblings? \n\nthank you! \n\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "I just need to vent. The hardest part of healing, for me, has been trying to build up a family of choice, or friends, or even just acquaintances. I was already ambivalent about coming back to this region, and I may leave it in April with what's left in my savings and try to start over somewhere else completely, if I keep having to deal with the attitudes and behaviors I keep encountering. I do think it is partly the region, rather than me attracting nasty people.\n\nBut I also worry that I expect a high level of maturity, perhaps too high, too high of standards. But then I think of the specific behaviors that I do not like in specific people (which makes me not like those people), and I don't feel wrong for setting a boundary or letting go of them, especially since they are triggering. \n\nI'm talking about things like my ex-boyfriend deciding it was okay to judge the appearances of total strangers (making fun of them). This is how I was mercilessly bullied in school and by Nmom. One of my housemates does the same thing. \n\nI have a coworker who likes to argue just to argue, and doesn't care if you have factual information on what he's arguing about, and will try to make you feel stupid instead of just stopping. He also tries to dominate how everything is done there, and is crass and sarcastic when he doesn't get what HE wants (you be damned).\n\nI do have 3 good coworkers, one who comes down just to say hi every day and joke around with me. The other two are nice ladies and I like them. I have a few friends that I don't see often (which I find painful) but keep in touch with over Facebook, which does help. I know they do care. \n\nBut I'm struggling. I don't really feel close to anyone, or have anybody to talk to about much of anything outside of a few interests/hobbies/work. The people who have known my background and could relate have betrayed me or have things like major FLEAs or whatever (which is perhaps not surprising in a way, since having that kind of background can certainly lead to behaviors like that). \n\nMaybe I should just focus on me for now? I do have to find and work a second job just to make ends meet right now. That's going to take up a lot of time, but IS healing (decent jobs have always healed me). I'm also trying to work with two books about trauma, one with a self-compassionate approach, one with an optimistic approach. It's just hard getting out of work for the day, knowing I'm driving 20 mins to my rented room with 3 housemates I don't relate to at all (and one I don't like), in a tiny village with nothing in it, knowing I'm stuck there with them each night.

        "text": "I feel very lonely.\n\nSince my mom passed away I'm torn between missing her a lot, reminding myself that she was a huge N and that she said many times that she died the day that my dad died 14 years ago.\n\nI cry a lot.\n\nIn the first week my cousins didn't leave me alone for a moment, but after that everybody just got on with their lives.\n\nI'm an only child and I have two cousins who both lead very busy lives.\n\nI have one friend who lives in a different city.\n\nThere are two people at work who I like a lot, I'd love to be friends with them outside of work, but I think that it's not something that they're interested in.\n\nI asked one a few times to go with me to see a movie, or do other sorts of activities, and she's always \"busy\". I asked her to help me with something that I honestly need help with and she said \"sure, if I'm free that day I'll help you\" and when I asked her if she wanted to come by to help me, she said, \"I don't want to.\"\n\nThe other guy, I asked if he wanted to hang out outside of work, I asked him once to help me restart the car - my car wouldn't start, and he had just left work also, so I called him to ask him for help and he said that that's the one thing he's not supposed to do because of some car battery issues he has. We talked about a series of books that has been adapted into a movie which I had just watched, so he showed me a picture of his collection of the books. I asked him if he would mind lending me one of the books to read and he said no, explained that it's because of some reasons and told me to find the books online.\n\nI'm not a doormat and I'm tired of asking people and being rejected all the time.\n\nOne of my cousins called earlier. I was sleeping and didn't hear the phone. When I called him back, he let his phone ring twice and then he hung up.\n\nHow do I make RL friends who will like to hang out with me?\n\nI'd love to move to where that one RL friend lives, but I'm afraid that she'll also start developing some sort of weird Mimbsi-allergy that will require for her to avoid me.\n\nI've spoken about my difficulty in making friends to my therapist, and she said that \"we'll be starting a support group soon, I can let you know when it starts\". She signed me up and it's been at least half a year since my last meeting with her and so far I haven't heard back from her.\n\nI was bullied through most of my school years, so it's not like I learned how to make friends as a kid. At home I was expected to play by myself in my room, unless we had company - which was usually my parents' friends with their own kids, and I lost contact with these people when my mom stopped contacting them years ago.\n\nI need to find out who I am, what I like, I need to learn how to live without having to bandage someone's legs once a day and help them dry their feet, or pushing them around in a wheelchair.\n\nI'm also trying to alleviate myself from all her belongings. Some I had success donating/selling, and some I'm still stuck with. It's stuff like silverware, glassware and other things that are just old. I'd love to try and make some money out of it, but I guess I'll end up donating everything.\n\nI keep seeing more and more of her handicraft - crochet doilies, cross-stich projects, grown-up coloring pages, and on one hand, it's all gorgeous, and I do want to keep it all, if only to make stuff out of them and sell them - bags or pillows or whatever.\n\nI feel guilty about throwing any of it away, and whenever I mention any of it to anyone, I'm told to keep it, it's my mom's.\n\nThere are a LOT of porcelain tchotchkes, none of it is my taste.\n\nI tried organizing a garage sale of sorts, but that sort of thing isn't very common here and only a few people came by, and I think that a bottle of perfume was stolen.\n\nI want to take a loooooooooong vacation somewhere where the only decision I'd have to make is what I want to eat for breakfast, but right now I can't afford to. It will be possible in a few months, I think, but I'm falling apart right now and I can't even take time off work.\n\n I have to keep at least one light on in the house at night. At first I kept them all on, started turning them off - each day one more, till I was down to only the hallway light which I turned off when I entered my room, but then I had this really scary nightmare in which I distinctly heard noise that sounded like a radio changing channels with bits of songs, and then the feeling that everything I'm trying to sell is angry at me for trying to get rid of it all. So now it's back to leaving 2-3 lights on. And now it's 3.30am and I'm supposed to get back out there to close the door that leads to the balcony and at least some of the lights.\n\nI'm supposed to start my life now, but how the hell do I do that?\n\n:-\\/",

It's only when she suckered people in that she became verbally abusive, and a shit-talker about her supposed \"friends.\"\n\nI felt bad for her, she admitted to low self-esteem that only the attraction of men seemed to fix. She admitted to \"faking it til she made it\" in her job. She radiated confidence and bravado at first glance, but eventually, because I was a slow learner, it fell away and I realized she was more lost than me.\n\nHaving said all that, this girl was a top-level twister of words, a hypocrite and a martyr. She'd complain about being taken advantage of yet continuously put herself in situations where being taken advantage of would be the very outcome... And she wouldn't hesitate to take advantage of me. Despite this, because I wanted her approval, I encouraged her to stand up for herself, I defended her to her \"friends\" that would get annoyed at her for telling them \"no.\" But in the end she chose them over me, always did.\n\nHer narcissistic qualities mostly came out around me. I treated her as best I could, tried to build her up and got shit in return. I thought she needed me, and maybe she did, but  not the way I thought; she needed me to tear down. She needed me to kick around...\n\nI'm sorry this post is getting rambly but my main question is this: has anyone experienced a narcissist or someone with fleas that still managed to show (or at least project) compassion and empathy towards others? Didn't it drive you bonkers?\n\nTl;dr Narcissist had moments where she showed compassion for others and it makes me doubt myself even though logically I know I was a good friend to her.

        "text": "Hi all, first time posting on here. Usually I'm on RBN, just came across this subreddit today and felt it more appropriate to write here.\n\nI am recovering from emotional abuse, and am a female in her 20s who grew up with not only a narcissistic father, but an *entire* narcissistic family. O_O' (On my Dad's side only.)\nAs you can imagine, my life sucked pretty much 24/7.\n\nI will only write a little bit here tonight, but I just want heal mostly and will be moving two states away from NDad in less than 9 months or so. (When I get some money. :U)\n\nCurrently I live with my mother in her mother's old mobile home, which is paid for. (Despite what my NDad claims about owning half of it since she passed away.) Ironically, my entire ex-Nfamily all live  just walking distance away from me, and I wouldn't have to look too far to see them coming up the driveway.\n\nI guess my point is this. Every time even the slightest of interactions occurs between us; say just seeing them nearby my house or whenever I get the mail, I get depressed and keep coming back to RBN to help/get reminded that I'm not in this alone.\n\nI am NC with them; have been for roughly 4 years now. I do not initiate any form of contact with them; they are the ones who constantly break the NC, forcing me to walk away immediately. It would be ridiculous to get a restraining order on them for this because 'legally' they haven't done anything wrong, and also the proximity of the housing would make it near impossible to not see them on a daily basis anyways.\n\nI will admit that in the years the NC had been great, and barely breached at all. They know by now i don't wish to speak with them, and they try their hardest (surprisingly) to not be out and about whenever I am. (though there is the occasional slip-up.)\n\nIt doesn't help that I live in a tiny town either. Though we are well beyond the ten thousand in population, there are only so many shops and places to go without running into one of them. \nIt sucks even further because on Fridays or Saturdays they *all* go out to eat, so me and my Normal Mother have to make sure we don't pick a restaurant they frequent at in case we run into them. (This happened once when we ran into NDad and God it was bad.)\n\nAnyways, I wasn't going to write this out until I had moved, but I've begun to see a pattern of depression? ptsd? form everytime this happens, so I can not just sit on this anymore.\n\nI don't really know what to say about all this. I know it's really just a waiting game, and i'm trying my hardest to hold on, but it gets harder every time my mom talks about us moving away, or packing this, or what we're going to do with my Mamaw's house after we're gone.  (All planned out, but still..) It makes me homesick, because I love the little town I live in and nothing will ever replace what I love about here.  It's not fair we have to move (even though my Nfamily is just one of the reasons), just because they're still alive and would continue to terrorize us if we stayed much longer.\n\nMy Nfamily was raised that family blood was *everything*. They would often tell me and my cousins that we couldn't trust anyone else but them because everyone else was out to get our goat, to essentially betray us the moment we let our guard down. \nSo they built (family name) Rd and put all their little houses on the property so that we'd be connected and (and also isolated from the world).\n\nI won't dive into deeper detail unless you all want to hear more?? But basically my Nfamily told us all kinds of shit and made up crap. They kept me and my mom away from her family (whom I'm just *now* getting to meet), by interrupting our planned trips to go see them, or damaging us emotionally so we had no energy to go.\n\nThey lived in like this odd little world, sorta like the Amish does? And lived on a doctrine built by my great great grandfather.\nWhat's even weirder was some of the shit I saw when I lived with my dad. (Evil spirits, emotional abuse to the point it looked like something out of a cliche sitcom, and of course the usual yelling and raising their voice to inhumane levels.)\n\nMy father was 'born' (cursed, if you believe in the supernatural) with a very rare genetic disease that could kill him at moment's notice, topped with Mono, that makes him very very ill all the time. No, I will not discuss the genetic disease, for fear that it will be linked back to me since it's so rare.\nThis made him irritable like crazy, and when he actually felt good is when he liked to emotionally abuse us.\n\nI guess I just needed to write all this out *phew*. I haven't really talked much to irl people because they think I've lost my ever loving mind because they 'just don't understand how Ndad could be that way. He's such a well mannered person and so is Nfamily!'.\n\nTo top this all off, I am a fully diagnosed Asperger's female, so my Ndad loved to deny and abuse me about that. (fun times.) I think most of my Nfamily is in some form or another Aspergers; which after talking to the person who diagnosed me, said it could be a possible thing that warped into Narcissim due to emotional neglect during their childhood.\n\nIs any of this making sense? Or am I just a ranting lunatic typing in the wrong forum? idk, on days like these I just feel so empty and alone....",

        "text": "Hi guys-\n\nI have a therapist I've been going to weekly for depression and family stuff, but I feel like a lot of the time she doesn't understand what it's like to be RBN, or raised in such a toxic family situation. I'm often frustrated sitting there trying to explain my life, and then when I do open up, I feel guilty because we were always taught to keep secrets, and I dunno I just feel guilty about opening up to anyone about my life and the shitty things that have happened in it. \n\nShe's helpful in other ways, but I can't bring myself to tell her how I feel. I've always been forced into therapy by my Nparents, and then when therapy doesn't work, it's because I'm 'not trying hard enough'. It's hard to explain to my therapist that I can't help when I dissociate, it's not that easy and I know she sees potential in me, but that just makes it worse, because my parents saw 'potential' in me too - it was why I was bad - I was wasting it and didn't deserve the gifts I was given. \n\nUgh...anyway this is all going to come out wrong because I feel like my head's in this terrible fog because of depression/dissociation/whatever, but do you guys have any advice? I'm worried about hurting my therapist's feelings, or that she'd get angry at me (she's been frustrated with me in the past) if I told her that her therapy isn't working out and I'd like to see someone else.\n\nI'll also add that the only reason I see her is that it's free under the government's help for children of addicts program (my Dad had problems with addiction). There are other counsellors in the program, but I don't know what to do. I'm on the verge of quitting therapy all together, but based on my history I don't know if that's a wise choice. I've been self-destructive in the past and only recently been getting back on my feet from that. I fully blame myself for that too - it wasn't my parents (they influenced the thinking, but I made some pretty poor choices that put me in the situation I'm in now.)\n\nAnyway - on a general note - how do you guys find a therapist that 'fits' you when you don't have a lot of disposable income and you've never been taught to have preferences, choices, etc. If someone liked me and I didn't like them, I was just kinda forced to go along with it and it was my fault for not trying hard enough. It's that old thing - I remember a time when my Dad's older male friend gave me the creeps as a teenager - he made comments about my appearance too (I'm female) and it was just blatantly dismissed. Now, I have the same reaction to so many men (but that's completely off topic). \n\nSo...how do you find a good therapist? Stand up to a therapist? Do you have an opposite-sex or same-sex therapist (if your issues are due to Nmom or Ndad). I had a NDad and have had terrible experiences with male therapists so I can't see that going well again. \n\n\n\n",

I'm assuming she will get a notification that the letter was undeliverable.\n\nMy birthday was miserable, I couldn't help but feel guilty. I got a text from my Nmom shortly after I turned the post man away; just a simple \"Happy birthday.. Love you\"  \n\nI know that things will get easier as time goes on, but sometimes I can't help but wonder if I'll always feel \"shitty\". WIth the holiday's coming up, my anxiety and depression are really weighing me down. Why is it so hard to cut off all contact!!?? Thank you again everyone, for the great advice. Here's to 22!",

        "text": "I've been around here and RBN for many years now but haven't actively commented in a couple years. Using a newly created account as family/friends know my main.\n\nI've been very angry lately.  The past couple months to be exact. I've had unexpected costs/needs arise over the summer so I've had to reduce the times I attend therapy to once a month. An hour once a month is not enough time to cover everything an ACON needs to talk about.  Most recently, I want to talk about my anger.\n\nGrowing up, my mom would SNAP.  Full on yelling, screaming, belittling, throwing items at me, saying nasty things to hurt feelings. Growing up, I could sense the tension of a SNAP oncoming. It was like a change in the winds. A eighth sense I developed. It was scary. It was not fair. It was cruel.  Because I grew up with it, it was my \"normal\". But I also knew that it was not normal to yell at people, to hit them (even strangers in public), to explode to that degree.  So I suppressed it.  I rarely got angry.  I did not express anger, ever.  I did not show any road rage. I would get annoyed or mad or irritated. But I never got angry.\n\nI escaped 2 years ago.  Out of that toxic household and I am very VLC until I am able to afford 100% of my bills (just my cell phone to take over) and remove my belongings from that hell hole of a house.  In the past two years, I went through grief, sadness, depression, happiness, and everything in between, all of the above except anger.  And now it's coming out.\n\nI cannot control the anger. I cannot control what angers me. I cannot control when it comes out and what fashion it comes out.  And it scares me. I've yelled at the man I love with all my heart. And I sobbed tears because I do not ever want to hurt him. I experience so much road rage now. Everyone's a frigging idiot. I'm having more episodes and more frequently.\n\nMy therapist wants me to work on expressing justified anger. She says I'm on a pendulum where instead of the quiet, submissive side, I've flung all the way to the explosion side.  Where I should be is in the middle.  But I kept telling her, I do not know HOW to healthily express anger.\n\nThat's what I ask for advice today: How do I express anger in a healthy manner? In what situations am I justified in being angry? How do I identify those situations? How do I identify the situations in which my anger is not justified? How do I let go of the anger? How do I calm down and relax and refocus my mind?",

        "text": "I feel kinda stupid. Just weeks ago, after a rather harmonious visit at home I posted on RBN, asking for advice on how to interact with a Narcissist after the abuse has stopped. And now this.\n(Also, I'm continually unsure which is the best subreddit to post what. That last one would have been better here, is this one maybe more RBN-material? Please let me know, if that is the case.)  \n  \nIn my post history you‘ll find the post, which also details our current relationship, but in the short version:  \n  \nAfter my parent‘s divorce 7, 8 years ago, I saw my father quite rarely, but when I did, it was for the most part on agreeable, if shallow terms. There was rarely even a hint of his former (passive-)aggressiveness or other dysfunctional patterns (like constant critizing, that sort of thing). He‘s still kinda weird, and I don‘t especially like him as a human being, if I'm honest, but we could hold a civil conversation.  \n  \nThe situation at hand is the following:  \n  \nOn Saturday it was my 25th birthday, so it was a somewhat significant one, too (if not as much as a 30th would be). For the occasion, the rest of my family (my mother, brother and grand-parents) came a long way to visit me in my now home-town and spend the day with me. I was somewhat nervous about that (as in, had a minor emotional flashback beforehand), but we got along quite well, they met my boyfriend, in the evening I met up with friends, everything was nice (more or less).  \n  \nExcept for one thing – I absolutely did not hear ANYthing from my Nfather. Usually he would make a point of sending me a package with gifts and stuff, and he would definitely call so I could express proper gratitude (which I would, because it‘s still nice, even if it‘s a substitute for actual parental love).  \n  \nYesterday, there was NOTHING. No package (which isn‘t that important), no text, no call. Well, his monthly support payment was slightly larger than usual, and there was a „Happy Birthday“ in the „intended use“-section of the transfer, but that was days before my birthday, and that was IT.  \n  \nLast thing we talked about (about 2 weeks before my birthday, I was very busy with work after that) was about my birthday wish from him and the specifications. I‘m fairly sure at least up until then he had every intention of not mostly ignoring my birthday, and I have no idea what changed.  \n  \nIt‘s possible that he sent a package and I didn‘t get the notification (I‘ll go to the post office tomorrow to check that out), and he was insulted because I didn‘t call and thank him profusely but well… so far, I didn‘t get anything, and a simple phone call from his side would have sorted this out.  \n  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n  \nI have no real idea what has brought this on, and I‘m tired of trying to riddle out what he isn‘t able to say about his emotions and expectations which lead to his behaviour, which I tried to do most of my life. I experience it as a form of punishment (analogous to how he wouldn‘t speak to me for a couple of days after we had one of our „fights“, until my mom forced him to „apologize“). But that is also the world viewed with my lense, and I have no real reason to believe that I can read his mind that way. I still feel angry at him for not observing the most basic of courtesies without explanation, and I‘m scared of the abuse coming back, because I swore to myself that I would go NC when this happens, and that means a lot of very uncomfortable decisions, and stress, and heart ache.  \n  \nThe important question to me (or to you, really) is – what is the appropriate response to this, which in every social context is at very least a intentional slight?  \n  \nMy goal would be to deescalate the situation to bring it back to our truce-like state from before, but I don‘t want to leave this standing uncommented, either, and deny that I have feelings at all.  \n  \nHow do I express my anger and disappointment without becoming narcissistic supply again? Do I do that at all, or do I try to grey-rock through this? What could that look like?  \n  \nFor now I decided to not react, because there is too much insecurity about the reasons for his behaviour and because I‘m teetering at the brink of the VERY major kind of flashback as is. But I don‘t know where to go from here, and what I should do.  \n  \nCould anyone talk me through this?  \n  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n  \nEDIT: I just want to add - I did get a birthday card from his new wife, which was very nice and heartfelt, but considering that the title was \"Whatever happens in life, chocolate helps\" and that she went to great lengths to assure me that I'm a \"fighter\" and a good person reinforces the idea that he's angry about something or other and punishing me, and she knows this but can't talk him out of it, and offers me some support instead.",
