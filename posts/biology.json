He is afraid of doctors and his GP is in a completely differant town so he rarely goes, unless it's to find more creams to soothe it. My dad believes it's caused by everything. He's blamed chocolate, sugar, caffeine, hayfever and a plethra of other things that I can't list of completely since it chabges every other week. Right now, he's blaming our cat which is odd since we've had him for much longer than my dad has had the condition. The condition appears all over his body, except his head. With skin breaking out all over, becoming painful, red and itchy with the skin peeling off in clumps. It's somewhere between a Freddy Krueger and a strawberry cheese-cake with coconut shavings on top. If you couldn't tell already, my dad is very very paranoid. In recent years, he's faced a lot of hardship. Recently, he's lost a few family members and has been overall severely stressed with dealing with the estates. He's also lost a few close friends, three this year alone. He's been very paranoid about health, death and the future. My dad has trouble seeing the finer details so he ends up only seeing the bigger picture. He's like a caged chicken but somehow more nihilistic. Apart from the skin condition and his mental health, my dad is in absolute perfect health. Probably because of his paranoia he does whatevers in his comfort zone to stay fit, active and healthy. Recently, he's been helping out with an upcoming music festival. He reaslised he needed to get out the house and stop staring into oblivion all day long. So he's been out there helping the festival crew with carpentry and other doo-dahs and he's been having alot of fun with it. I could tell because he's finding it hard to come up with things to complain about. But he admitted something to me. He said that he didn't have much of a problem with his skin when he was out there doing the work. \n\nWhich made me realise something. So there's no doubt in my mind the skin issue is an autoimmune disease. Both myself and my sister suffer from them, mine being somewhat more horrendous because I have both messed up bones and messed up muscles that stiffen up like a bastard. So the condition is obviously hereditary, since neither me nor my sister share a mother. My dad is almost on the verge of this as well. But I have a hypothesis that may explain the severity of my father's condition. \n\nIs it possible for an autoimmune disease to worsen in part due to stress, anxiety or other intense emotions? Because to me, that seems to be the most fitting diagnoses for my dad. And not just this, but what would be a good way to treat this? \n\nAny help will do, thank you for taking your time to read through this.","upvote_ratio":0.5,"created_utc":1678401385.0},{"title":"Would it be possible to treat cancer with fasting?","author":"Frasenarinteupptagen","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/biology\/comments\/11n4gf7\/would_it_be_possible_to_treat_cancer_with_fasting\/","text":"I'm thinking that since the proliferating cells are unable to stop, the normal cells might enter an energy conserving state while the cancer cells malfunction because of a lack of nutrient","upvote_ratio":0.56,"created_utc":1678397467.0},{"title":"What are the most significant examples of rapid diagnostic tests reducing antimicrobial use?","author":"Mochapine_","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/biology\/comments\/11n3f6y\/what_are_the_most_significant_examples_of_rapid\/","text":"I'm writing a dissertation for a school project, and was wondering if anybody could point out some worthwhile examples to look into, specifically ones involving bacteria and reducing antibiotic prescription\/use.

Here\u2019s what I understand so far:\n\nA photon strikes PSII, either the accessory pigments or the P680 reaction center. The chlorophyll-a dimer then reduces pheophytin, which goes along the ETC. Now, P680+ is an oxidizing agent (1.3 V redox potential,) and is able to return to its ground state by oxidizing a tyrosine residue.\n\nNotice how I didn\u2019t bring up any numbers, and that\u2019s what stumps me even more. I believe 8 photons are needed to synthesize one molecular oxygen. But how many photons are able to excite an electron so it can be passed onto pheophytin? I believe 2 electrons total must be donated to the acceptor molecule, because that\u2019s how plastoquinone will get reduced to plastoquinol. \n\nI know that for the OEC, 4 electrons are transferred back to P680+, one at a time, through that tyrosine residue. But since only 2 electrons reduce plastoquinone and are needed to continue the ETC, are the 2 left over held on to reduce oxidative damage, what\u2019s going on? \n\nSorry it\u2019s late, I\u2019ve not slept, and I sound super incoherent lol.

Australian Aboriginals can have different shades of brown and blonde hair, and so do some Melanesians like the Solomon Islanders.  Central Asia also has every hair color, and plenty of ethnic groups there (e.g. the Nuristanis or Kalashes) have red or blonde hair as common traits, although brown and black are more common in the area too. The Middle East, North Africa, and East Asia see brown and black haired people. However, South Asians, Southeast Asians, Polynesians, sub-Saharan Africans, and Native Americans almost always have black hair.\n\nFor eye colors, it seems that the further away from Europe you are, the more likely that your eyes will be brown.

However, I also know that chemosynthesis is less efficient and will require new enzymes and the like for it to work. So for evolution, they would need a remodelled transport system and a different enzyme system. Reproduction would be a problem though because of the lack of a method of pollination or spreading seeds. I also realised that anaerobic respiration in plants produces ethanoic acid, which contains an acetate compound. Does anyone have any idea on this or something that can come to my knowledge?\n\nEdit: I realise that mycoheterotrophism isn't parasitism so I'm going to have to rectify this. I get that the hypothetical plant will likely have to make some symbiotic relationships, but as far as I can tell, this is mainly for reproduction than anything else if it can develop the enzyme and transport system to chemosynthesise using acetate.","upvote_ratio":0.33,"created_utc":1678217107.0},{"title":"Exchange term abroad for biology students - where did you go?","author":"HirkumPirkum","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/biology\/comments\/11l5p7x\/exchange_term_abroad_for_biology_students_where\/","text":"Hi everyone,\n\nI'm currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in biology at a university in Sweden, and I'm considering doing an exchange term abroad to gain some new perspectives and experiences.

I've always wondered how spindle fibers (or was it microtubules? or both? sorry I just took biology out of interest, not my major.  I've stuck with engineering aerodynamics and physics mainly) communicate with eachother during both splits.  As far as I can find, there are no specific mechanisms as to how each side communicates.  Or if they need to at all?  Does the cell just \"commit apoptosis\" if something goes wrong and one side doesn't hold up it's end of the bargain.  Apparently Jung and Wolfgang worked on some theories together, but there are no definitive biological signals that I can find.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo be more specific, I'm curious how each side of the cell works in unison considering cells don't think or talk.

He found a negative current - a stream of electrons - flowing from the wound for the first few days. A similar current of injury is emitted from all wounds in animals.\"* \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy question is in regard to the last sentence there. If there is an electrical current emitted from wounds in all animals, does this play some role in pain perception?

A little bit about me: I am a blind woman in the sciences. I have my undergraduate degree in neuroscience and am currently finishing my MS in biological sciences with a neuroscience focus. I will be graduating in May 2023 and have actively been looking for jobs, but am finding it extremely difficult. I had already anticipated these challenges given that, even with the EEOC and ADA in place to protect disabled people and make it illegal for us to be discriminated against in the hiring process, that still does not prevent discrimination from happening. I have applied to hundreds of jobs so far and have either not heard back or have not been selected. I have noticed that when I answer \"no\" to the disability question, I at least get emails saying the company has received my application and that it is being reviewed, but I don't know if that necessarily means anything.\n\nWhile I know being blind puts me at a disadvantage societally and especially in the job search, I also know I have drive and determination coupled with skills which can hopefully level the playing field for me. My degrees have developed many skills which are of value to employers. Some of my strengths include:\n\n\u00b7  Technical writing (scientific papers, literature reviews, research proposals)\n\n\u00b7  Presentation skills (giving scientific presentations to diverse audiences and adapting communication style)\n\n\u00b7  Interpersonal skills\/teamwork (used both in the laboratory and as a Graduate Teaching Assistant)\n\n\u00b7  Problem-solving\n\n\u00b7  Critical thinking\n\n\u00b7  Adaptability\n\n\u00b7  Learning fast\n\n\u00b7  Organized\n\n\u00b7  Self-starting\n\n\u00b7  Attention to detail \n\n\u00b7  Data analysis\n\n\u00b7  Time-management\n\n\u00b7  Etc.\n\nGiven the above, what are some job options that would be suitable for me? I love science, but I would not be opposed to working in another field if my skills are beneficial there.\n\nSome things to note: screen readers like VoiceOver and tools like ZoomText on computers make almost everything accessible to the blind. I cannot drive, so I do not know how realistic a job in medical\/pharmaceutical sales would be haha. I also have a guide dog, so any job which involves being in close proximity to hazardous chemicals\/fumes would not be ideal. \n\nThank you for reading and for any feedback you can give!","upvote_ratio":0.93,"created_utc":1677893940.0},{"title":"Some experts say more women should consider removing fallopian tubes to reduce cancer risk | CNN","author":"VCardBGone","url":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2023\/03\/03\/health\/fallopian-tube-removal-cancer-risk-wellness\/index.html","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.77,"created_utc":1677901701.0},{"title":"Why do plants need oxygen?","author":"Worldly_Roof2495","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/biology\/comments\/11i8siq\/why_do_plants_need_oxygen\/","text":"I was studying and I got confused.

But I am currently undecided as to what field of research I should do for that internship.\n\nFor some context, I took AP Biology last year and did super well in the class (97 unweighted) and the national exam (4). The class really sparked my interest in biology and the study of life. Since then, I've been thinking about doing a summer research internship (unpaid, of course\u2014I AM in high school) concerning some field of biology.\n\nI've been looking into some biology professors who I could cold-email asking for an internship. More specifically, I've been reading some research papers from various professors to decide whether or not their area of expertise in biology would interest me. However, upon reading their papers, I quickly realized that I had no idea what the heck I was reading. The research papers were far too complicated and in-depth for an aspiring researcher like me. Bear in mind that I am fresh out of AP Biology, so all my knowledge of biology comes from that course alone.\n\nIn terms of what I want to research, I am most interested in learning about cell biology, biochemistry, molecular biology, structural biology, or anything of that sort (all that \"micro\" stuff\u2014not evolution, ecology, ethology, biosystematics or anything like that). So, I create this post to ask a few things:\n\n1. Where should I start? Like, is there any place where I could start doing research at my level of understanding? I really want to do something like this, but I don't want to show up at the internship not knowing anything about the field I would be participating in.\n2. What exactly should I study? I understand that all the fields I mentioned just now aren't very specific. I just need a personal opinion, really: what, specifically, did you find interesting in the fields I mentioned that you think I also could do research on?\n3. Is doing this reasonable at all? People always tell me that I shouldn't do research simply because I'm not \"advanced enough\" or something along those lines. But I also see countless blogs, articles and videos that tell me that I can and should do it. What's your advice? If I shouldn't do it, what SHOULD I do to enrich myself (so to speak) and my interest in biology? Just to clarify, I'm NOT doing this just to \"impress colleges\", or whatever. I'm doing this exclusively out of my own, personal interest in learning about biology.","upvote_ratio":0.57,"created_utc":1677959487.0},{"title":"Why would extra cellular matrix coming out of my g-tube after pancreatic surgery?","author":"Theonlysweetroll","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/gallery\/11i2bpq","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.75,"created_utc":1677944783.0},{"title":"If (hypothetically) I would have some blood at the temperature of around 40*C (100*F) and constantely mix it so it wouldn't coaugalate, could I keep Dirofilaria immitis as pet?","author":"IDK-__-IDK","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/biology\/comments\/11i8k1t\/if_hypothetically_i_would_have_some_blood_at_the\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.5,"created_utc":1677953074.0},{"title":"My read of the weekend recommendation","author":"Icy_Cut_5572","url":"https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/s41467-023-36940-z","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.66,"created_utc":1677951061.0},{"title":"Are capsule ligaments innervated?","author":"computerstuffs","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/biology\/comments\/11i6xtu\/are_capsule_ligaments_innervated\/","text":"I've read that the ligaments\\ connective tissue that surrounds joint capsules receive a lot of bloodflow, does this mean they're innervated?\n\nWikipedia says \"The outer layer is highly innervated\" https:\/\/wikiless.tiekoetter.com\/wiki\/Joint_capsule?lang=en\n\nIs that referring to the ligament \\connective tissue?","upvote_ratio":0.5,"created_utc":1677950163.0},{"title":"Why can't secondary hyperalgesia be suppressed with NSAIDs?","author":"Apnosts","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/biology\/comments\/11i5jxb\/why_cant_secondary_hyperalgesia_be_suppressed\/","text":"hello.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am a student learning about Hyperalgesia recently.\n\nIn the meantime, two questions arose.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1.

I know genetic mutations are relatively rare but what would the effects of the chromosomal damage look like over a span of a given time, would it appear faster or would the rate at which it appears not matter and all that Is changed is the fact that you're eventually going to, more than likely, form some cancerous mutation.

Because of several other issues she was basically left in a bed and the minimum of care was provided.  She no longer has the strength to walk and her current rehab center has not provided any physical therapy in over a month.  \n\nMy wife and I want to move her across the country to live with us.  We have a private room and bed available for her to live in and recover in.  I know we can supervise and provide better care for her here locally.  \n\nHer c. Auris infection was diagnosed 5+ months ago and she hasn't been retested (which might not be important as I know the current thinking is once you are colonized you are always colonized).  \n\nThe move would entail her flying 6+ hours with my wife to get here.  We have gone into excruciating detail when planning this trip to make sure she will arrive safe and healthy.  But when we discussed it with her current care facility they said that they wouldn't allow it, and they would report us to the CDC and department of public health if we attempted it.  They want her kept isolated in a bed alone, in a diaper, for basically the rest of her life.\n\nThe information on the CDC website is pretty scant when looking for advice on such a move, or travel in general with c. Auris.  They do a good job of painting it as doom and gloom, but at the same time recommend zero treatment if you have a noninvasive infection, and they say non infected people are safe to interact with colonized individuals as long as they take general extra precautions with cleaning their hands etc after interacting with them.\n\nAccording to the CDCs current heat map she is in the red zone a totally white zone.

The only thing that I am truly passionate for is zoology, it\u2019s my childhood dream. From mammals to arthropods, I adore it. Studying animals brings me more joy than anything in this world.\nZoology is the only field I actually feel confident in pursuing, but I\u2019m not sure if that will lead me straight into unemployment.\n\nI\u2019m thinking about switching to veterinary medicine. I always had strong interest in medicine too.\n\nNow, I know this is a silly point, but I want to get it off my chest: my partner has a strong bias towards biology, and belittles my idea to study veterinary medicine as something \u201clesser than\u201d pursuing science. I study for myself and not my partner, I would never choose it \u201cfor\u201d them. But those comments give me a lot of insecurity and feelings of inferiority, they really scratched my ego. I know I shouldn\u2019t choose on basis of that, but maybe someone here can\u2026 idk give me a different perspective. I don\u2019t know what to think about it.\n\nOf course I\u2019d like to be a researcher, and go on expeditions and all that. It was always my dream, but I\u2019m not sure how realistic that is for my future. At least I know there are jobs waiting at the end of a veterinary degree, even though they are very hard.

I think many people have a vague notion that they exist, but have no idea how crucial they are to life as we know it.\n\nIndeed, **without mycorrhiza there would be no plants and no animals on land!** Well, maybe they would have made it eventually, but they would probably look very different. All land plants are the descendants of *one* common ancestor that could only make it out of the water because the fungi in the soil were helping it to survive, to get water and nutrients. Only later did plants develop roots. And the first animals on land were arthropods, insects and spiders and such, and they were eating fungi and plants. So without the symbiosis of plants and fungi they couldn\u2019t have survived there either.\n\nAnd don\u2019t think that modern plants don\u2019t need the fungi anymore because they have roots! Almost all plants are still in constant symbiosis with the mycorrhiza fungi. All root tips are surrounded and permeated by fungi filaments and they help the plant get water and nutrients out of the soil, especially phosphorus. And in return they get some sugar from the plants that they produce via photosynthesis. Indeed, some plants, like orchids, can\u2019t even germinate without the right kind of fungus present. So an orchid alone can\u2019t live. **Every orchid is kind of a plant-fungus hybrid creature. But indeed, you could pretty much say that of all plants**. Without mycorrhiza fungi they can\u2019t grow as well. Mycorrhiza are just as much a part of being a plant than roots or leaves.\n\nOf course you\u2019ve seen albino animals, but **have you heard of albino plants?** These plants are completely white. They don\u2019t have any chlorophyll, can't do *any* photosynthesis. So how can they survive? They get all their nutrients from the fungal network. Sometimes I read that other plants give them some of their energy, but this again is a very plantist view. It\u2019s actually the fungi that redistribute the nutrients between the plants. The plants don\u2019t have much say in it at all. And why do the fungi do that? Keep alive a hungry mouth that doesn\u2019t give anything back? Well, maybe it\u2019s just an accident? Maybe if the fungi \u201cknew\u201d what\u2019s going on, they would stop? Meaning the albino plants are straight up parasites? Or maybe they do give something back. Maybe their thick roots help with making the soil accessible. **And maybe they provide something potentially even more valuable: Information**. For the vast fungal network, feeding one plant might not be a large cost at all. But the albino tree is one more node in the network, a sensory organ.\n\nPlants are amazing creatures for sure, but for some of their cool abilities fungi should actually get the credit. Here, have you heard of something like this before: There are plants, when they get eaten by caterpillars, they produce a scent that attracts wasps that lay eggs in the caterpillar and then that\u2019s the end for the hungry hungry caterpillar\u2026 So this is pretty cool, a plant calling the enemy of their enemy to get rid of them. But what\u2019s even cooler is that other plants nearby also realize what\u2019s going on and call the wasps, even though there are no caterpillars on them! This is often celebrated as an example of communication and collaboration in plants. But rarely do the fungi get the credit! Do you know how the other plant knows that one of them is eaten by caterpillars? The fungi tell them! And if you wanted to make the case, you could spin it into a more fungi-centric narrative (and of course that\u2019s what I\u2019ll do here) and say that **the fungus is raising it\u2019s plants like a farmer and when caterpillars threaten its crops, it makes sure to have them call for the wasps** and tells its other plants to do the same. So really, it\u2019s a story about amazing awareness and coordination and husbandry in fungi! The plants are just along for the ride. The true narrative is probably somewhere between these two, but my point is, don\u2019t forget and underestimate the fungi.\n\nThe mycorrhiza connect all plants and other fungi. And both also communicate with animals. It is, therefore, no exaggeration to say that all living things of an island or a continent are connected by a web, exchanging resources and information. Just like in James Cameron\u2019s Avatar, which was in fact inspired by the mycorrhiza fungi. Sadly, we can\u2019t really browse the wood wide web. We\u2019d have to learn the language of the fungi first.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1676882094.0},{"title":"A bit silly question","author":"Blutig159","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/biology\/comments\/117kidk\/a_bit_silly_question\/","text":"I was with a friend a couple of days ago in the pool, and suddenly, as is normal, our fingers wrinkled, she told me \"do you know why they wrinkle?\", I told her it's because the dead skin absorbs some water , and she told me \"no, it's because the nerves of the fingers change to better grip things in the water\", Sooooo... what is the reason? or both are part of the reason?

Last night at around 3am me and my friend where sitting by the bonfire, and decided to go for a little night walk beacuse the night sky was amazing. \n\nAt one point we had to walk across about 1km of open field between two small \"villages\" or rather settlements of a few houses. \n\nAbout 200 meters to  left of us there is a small barn where a farmer lives. \nWhen we noticed someone on the second floor was following something on the field with his bright torch, so i swung my torch around to check out what he was looking at (already odd that he was doing so at 3am).\n\nVery quickly a what we think couldve only been a wolf came into the spotlight of both, the farmers and our flashlights. \nThe wolf at first started to walk in a straight line towards the treeline of the forest, when he stopped dead in his tracks and looked at us, his green\/red white firey glowy eyes reflected back to us. \nAfter about 30 seconds of a staredown he started to walk, then gallop towards us. \n\nImmediately we started to walk slowly to the next village, as we didnt want to signal to him that we were prey that would run from him. As we started walking, his galloping turned into a faster gallop, covering about 50 meters in no time, which is when we started sprinting as he was now only about 100 meters from us. \nAll the while were running, im pointing my flashlight backwards at him to keep him insight. He stopped the pursuit once we entered the village (presumably because he knows that a populated area is way too dangerous for him to go).\nBut essentially got very close to us (about 80 meters).\n\nA few factors that made us certain it was a wolf:\n1.)  Walking in determined absolutely straight lines (as to preserve energy, as they dont know when they will have their next meal, unlike a dog that might wonder a little left or right, as he knows he will definitely get fed)\n\n2.)  The sheer size of this absolut unit (we were flabbergasted) \n\n3.) His movement and behaviour once we entered the village.\n\n4.) We had a good look at him during the staredown, while being illuminated from 2 different angles by the farmers torch and mine. \n\n5.) Once we got to the village we came across an absolutely terrified cat. (The housecats here in this area are badasses and no comparisson to city cats) \nI smoke a joint on my balcony every night and have seen many many cat hunts from start to finish, also have seen just about every behaviour a cat has to offer, but this was a first.\nIve never seen a cat this terrified.\n\n6.) The silence and fluidity of the wolfs movement. A dog maybe wouldve barked or reacted different. \n\nQuestion: A wolf of this size could hunt just about anything that lives in this area, why would he show this behaviour towards humans, when they are definitely smart enough to know how dangerous a human is.\nWas it maybe because he felt threatened being lit up by two torches from different angles? \n\nCheers","upvote_ratio":0.87,"created_utc":1676821761.0},{"title":"Chemicals effect duration in body?","author":"TomatilloExtension80","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/biology\/comments\/116r6ty\/chemicals_effect_duration_in_body\/","text":"How do i calculate how long specific meds or supplements can stress organs like liver and kidney?

Without getting into physics, essentially they do this because if light speed is constant, their math doesn\u2019t work out unless time moves more slowly for a relative observer who is accelerating than one who is static. \n\nSupposedly they do use the time dilation equations when calculating values for GPS and this is the argument that special relativity is real. \n\nBut I can\u2019t wrap my head around thought experiments where physical processes, like aging, the cell cycle, cell division, telomere loss etc would be changed by something as arbitrary as \u201ctime\u201d or even entropic force. \n\nSimilarly, when physicists use the paradox of clocks moving faster or slower, there\u2019s a physical force they are ignoring - whether the strong force that acts on particle decay of an atomic clock or the spring or gravitational force that acts on a pendulum clock. Maybe the bending of space or acceleration affects those forces but how can it be a matter of \u201ctime\u201d moving at different speeds? If time can affect a clock mechanism or a dividing cell, then what is the force carrier of \u201ctime\u201d?\n\nSo, getting back to the case of humans, what determines the rate at which we age? We know that many things determine the rate of cell division, such as hormones, growth factors, and available nutrients. But as far as the process of growing from a baby to a toddler to a child to adult, and then decaying into old age, what would determine physically the rate at which that occurs? Could it be different than what we observe? Maybe it has been in different eras due to environmental factors, but not wildly different. \n\nBut, imagine the twin paradox. If you put a baby on a spaceship accelerated close to the speed of light, while its twin remains on earth, supposedly once the space baby returns he will be much younger than his twin who is now an old man. But is that physically manifested? Would his cells have divided at a slower rate? How could they have? He\u2019s just going along in a spaceship, living life on his own terms.

I can imagine a graph with reps\/maximal possible muscle contraction force that shows a declining max force with each rep. When that graph intersects the line that represents the force needed to perform another rep with a certain weight we call that failure. From an outside perspective that is significant because we can't do another rep. From the perspective of the muscle it doesn't seem like a very special moment. After all, depending on the selected weight that intersection can be moved around. In what way does failure as described above cause a special series of events that triggers hypertrophy that is distinct from the other pathways (like microtrauma, lactic acid buildup etc etc.)\n\n-to highlight the point above even more. If i perform an excercise with a weight that allows me to do 10 reps and after 5 reps someone pushes on the bar to simulate failure. Since failure is simply the moment where your muscle cant contract harder then the required force this should be a identical moment to the \"natural\" failure if i just rep untill I can lift it without some else pushing down. Off course the total volume of the workout would be higher and the muscle had to do more work so that would be a more effective workout. But if that is the only consideration here then the advice should just be \"maximize the amount of work your muscles have to do with a given weight\" and that happens to be the amount you can do untill you reach failure. But to me it seems like the research indicates the moment of reaching failure has some special significance for the body that triggers hypertrophy on its own.\n\nPut simply: if muscle failure is something the body can recognize as a signal for hypertrophy, how can it distinguish this from \"simulated\" failure by suddenly introducing an extra force?","upvote_ratio":0.75,"created_utc":1676636321.0},{"title":"Unlocking the Mystery of Cancer Cell Movement: Logic Gates Provide Answers","author":"cbirt_","url":"https:\/\/cbirt.net\/unlocking-the-mystery-of-cancer-cell-movement-logic-gates-provide-answers\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.81,"created_utc":1676627533.0},{"title":"Moderna vaccine for influenza: Trial shows promise, but falls short of expectations","author":"VCardBGone","url":"https:\/\/www.livemint.com\/news\/world\/moderna-vaccine-for-influenza-covid19-trial-shows-promise-11676590910858.html","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.75,"created_utc":1676630921.0},{"title":"US cancer patient developed uncontrollable Irish accent","author":"VCardBGone","url":"https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/world-us-canada-64671894","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.67,"created_utc":1676630348.0},{"title":"Is there a distinct point where insects\/organisms become so small they are unable to be crushed by most means?","author":"Any_Contest7699","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/biology\/comments\/1148zm6\/is_there_a_distinct_point_where_insectsorganisms\/","text":"Like tardigrades or dust mites for example; there's no way you could squish and kill them between your fingers, right?","upvote_ratio":0.77,"created_utc":1676603018.0},{"title":"Diabeetes","author":"S0ckm0nk3y_007","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/biology\/comments\/114ak0p\/diabeetes\/","text":"Why don\u2019t all bees have diabetes considering all they consume is nectar","upvote_ratio":0.53,"created_utc":1676608026.0},{"title":"No jobs?","author":"4rtemys","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/biology\/comments\/114f5az\/no_jobs\/","text":"I just finished my BSc in biology and psychology with a minor in chemistry.

It may seem strange to see an Asian student suddenly asking for help, but I'm writing this because an endangered bird is on the verge of extinction by public and media irrelevance and hypocritical animal rights groups. The situation seems difficult to resolve on its own in South Korea, which is why it is trying to convey this message to 3 million unseen foreigners.\n\n\nAt the southern end of the Korean Peninsula is a small island called Marado. The island, which is first reached by numerous migratory birds passing through Korea through the Korean Peninsula, is visited by migratory birds who have completed a long journey every spring.\n\n\nSynthliboramphus wumizusume,\u00a0commonly called the Japanese murrelet, is a special species among birds that come to Marado. It is estimated that there are only 5,000 to 10,000 birds left in the world, like sea otters, floating on the sea all their lives, and They come up to the ground only during their breeding season. They build nests in steep places like cliffs and lay one or two eggs, and their young do not come up to the land until they are mature enough to jump into the sea and reproduce as soon as they are born. In other words, for them, 'island' is the minimum condition necessary for reproduction and species' survival.\n\n\nBut these precious birds are now in danger by an ecological disturbance in Marado Island. It's a cat.\n\n\nThe world's notorious ecological disturbance, the cat, is an invasive species believed to have been brought into Marado by humans to fight off rats. These cats have grown in number very quickly through food given by islanders, and as a result, they are causing serious damage to migratory birds visiting the island. For example,\u00a0Locustella pleskei, which is listed as vulnerable on the IUCN red list, is reported to be severely damaged by cats in Marado. The same is true of Japanese murrelet.\n\n\nAccording to Marado's Japanese murrelet population viability analysis following the neutralization of street cats, if the maximum number of cats is more than 80, Marado's Japanese murrelets are estimated to be extinct within 20 years.\n\nNevertheless, only the 'TNR' policy was implemented for the cats. TNR stands for Trap-Neuter-Return, literally capturing and castrating cats back into the wild. However, numerous papers have shown that the TNR policy is meaningless in reducing cat populations and does not inhibit the hunting of stray cats.\n\n\nIn addition to feeding street cats, TNR was conducted for three years, and according to the tally in May 2022, there are estimated to be 117 street cats in Marado. These figures are also estimated by non-professional animal rights groups, and the actual number of street cats is likely to be higher. Again, at this rate, Marado's Japanese murrelet is likely to be wiped out in the next 20 years.\n\n\nRecently, due to the influence of YouTube and the bird-watching community, opinions have increased to protect Japanese murrelet. Thanks to him, high-ranking officials in the Republic of Korea were interested in the situation, which led to a meeting on January 31 this year to move the island's cats out of the island. Many bird enthusiasts in Korea were enthusiastic about this, and everything seemed to go smoothly.\n\n\nBut the outcome of the meeting was the opposite of what was expected. In the results of the meeting, it was decided that various experts and animal rights groups would launch a consultative body on February 10th, without anything related to the migration of cats. They claimed that they would come up with cat control measures only after monitoring and collecting opinions from local residents. Control measures, such as migrating cats, should have been implemented before February when the Janese murrelet arrives in Marado, but under the current circumstances, it is not possible to protect the ducks that will be harmed by cats.\n\n\nThe majority of animal rights groups in Korea argue that feeding street cats is ethical, and it is natural to be outdoors. And they believe in the effects of TNR, saying that there is no harm to the ecosystem of street cats. They also make contradictory statements that street cats are good animals because they catch mice and that TNRs do not hunt wild animals.\n\nNumerous animal rights groups and individuals in Korea accuse conservationists of not feeding street cats to preserve wild animals or raising them at home as animal haters. And they hide behind anonymity and bury them socially. They cyberbulled professors and journalists who studied and reported on street cats, and even an animal rights group destroyed motion-sensing cameras installed in the field, disrupting investigations into street cats.\n\n\nHowever, despite their violent behavior, many people and government agencies believe that animal rights groups represent the weak, so there are no sanctions against them. Their influence in Korea is considerable. There is also very little public interest in wildlife. Therefore, the value of conservation of wild birds against cats is easily ignored. Conservationists in Korea have been warning about the adverse effects of street cats on biodiversity for many years, but they have only been stigmatized as animal haters.\n\nI do not lying, and it's realy serious situation.\n\nI wrote this post because I thought I should let foreign countries know about this in this desperate situation. Many of Marado's endangered migratory birds must be preserved. Another purpose of this article is to promote the hypocrisy of animal rights groups in Korea to the world and encourage people to act. If this article is to be worthwhile, it needs to be delivered to more people. Please convey my voice and this message to your friends, family, and major media and wildlife conservation organizations as much as you can. If you love the Earth's ecosystem and animals, please help protect the birds of Marado.\n\nPlease.\n\n\n\nI'd appreciate it if you could look at the good materials here.\n\n\nWikipedia's japanese murrelet\n\nhttps:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Japanese_murrelet\n\n\nVideo accusing cats of destroying the ecosystem in South Korea (with English subtitles)\n\nhttps:\/\/youtu.be\/Fg_GAC8ppHs","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1675686100.0},{"title":"Why is Alzheimer\u2019s not considered a prion disease?","author":"EchoXResonate","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/biology\/comments\/10q8hft\/why_is_alzheimers_not_considered_a_prion_disease\/","text":"If AB42 tends to form itself into B sheets, why doesn\u2019t the aggregation of AB42 make Alzheimer\u2019s a prion disease?","upvote_ratio":0.89,"created_utc":1675194393.0},{"title":"What is THIS bug?!","author":"nitroFA","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/gallery\/10nkfg6","text":"What is THIS bug?
