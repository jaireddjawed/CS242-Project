I just finished my first semester of engineering and while for the most part I feel okay, I failed a class and it's seriously making me question everything.\n\nI failed calculus, which is arguably the easiest class in first year engineering. My grade is 3% below the passing the grade and I feel fucking awful. But I'm not here to rant about that.\n\nIf I can't do a math course, am I suitable to be an engineer? I've always wanted to be one since I was a kid but if I failed one of the most important classes for engineering, am I seriously cut out for this stuff?\n\nI know it's all on me because I didn't study as much as I should've and I didn't practice as much as I should've either. But failing? I don't think you fail unless you put in 0 effort, and I at least put some effort into this class.\n\nI'm trying to stay on topic and I don't wanna ramble on any further, so I'm just gonna ask: should I continue down this path? Or should I stop wasting my time right here and look for something else? I don't even know what else I would want to study.\n\nFor reference, I'm an 18M from Canada.",

I am being asked by a client (a City) to replace an existing curb ramp that doesn't meet standards, however the intersection has no curb ramps on the other 3 corners. If I replace the existing ramp and bring it to standard, is it acceptable to leave out the other corners of the intersection? \n\nThe client also asked me to paint in a crosswalk however their standards refer to MUTCD which advises a traffic study prior to painting any new crosswalks. The client doesn't want a traffic study, which I'm arguing since they use MUTCD. Additionally, I think if I replace the existing ramp and paint a crosswalk but do not add a receiving ramp that this would create a compliance issue with the ADA requirements but I am having trouble understanding the exact language that would argue this situation with my client. Or maybe I am not understanding the language correctly. Could be either. \n\nSame project but the client also wants me to add a new curb ramp at a mid-block crossing that currently does not have ramps. They only want a ramp on one side so the other side of the street would not have a receiving ramp in the finished condition. The existing condition already has a cross walk painted which also seems odd for me to then provide a single ramp leading into this crosswalk without adding a ramp on the opposite side. \n\nSimplified question, can I put a curb ramp in without a receiving ramp?",

Just to be clear I am not an engeneering student, I study industrial design.\n\nIt is a tensioning mechanism, I believe the pictures show clearly enough how it's supposed to work so I won't be explaining that. The problem I ran into is the cliping and empty spaces between the two elements when the base (green) is rotated. I used 2d drawings as a base for the solid. I tried many different approches. Projecting the drawings onto a round surface, trimming extruded drawings vertically with the 2 cricle curves, eliminating the slope in the drawing and later trimming them (now solids) with a sloped surface. In the end, after each try, the 2 elements only matched in the position they were modeled at and once rotated, they clip on one side and create a gap on the other.\n\nI believe it happenes because the perfectly flat slope gets elongated once projected onto a curved surface therefore the slope is not uniform and is curved in the z axis. I checked by unrolling the surface uv and it was true, the sloped edge is curved in the z axis. So I made the sloped edge of the unrolled surface straight and used this surface to model the solid but even more errors occured.\n\nI tried many many more different things but nothing worked and I even started questioning if such geometry, where both edges match at any given point during the rotation, is even possible haha.\n\nSo yeah, is it?! I believe there must be some averaged curve (of the sloped edge) that matches. If so how can I calculate it?\n\nThanks in advance :)",

My biggest concern right now is the holes the helicoils are threaded into wallering out over time and taking on an oval shape.

        "text": " Hi Everyone,\n\nI'm thinking of buying a condo in a liquefaction risk zone and was hoping to get some of your opinions. I know the general consensus is to not buy in these areas, but this is a beautiful up and coming area, you get much more in this area for the price and I plan to only live there for a few years (so taking a bit of a calculated risk I suppose). I live on the west coast of Canada so there is a risk of earthquakes, but I am planning to get earthquake insurance and have talked to many agents to get a consensus that I could cover my bases if something were to happen. My concern mostly relates to risk of loss of life.\n\nI  see I can't attach photos so I will try to explain the layout as concisely as possible. The condo I am interested in is located about 5m above sea level, by a river (so it is built on river sands). From here there is an increase in elevation that leads to one other set of buildings higher than my site, then a 4-lane road above them and then a golf course with an stream at a higher elevation of the road.  This elevation increase is at about an average 10% slope, but the buildings, roads, etc. are all cut into the slope so it is not as though it is a consistent hillside. It would more look like steps if looking at it from the side. The whole area has been flagged as a liquefaction risk. I believe the top end is included in the risk zone because it was an old stream/ravine that has been infilled. So I'm guessing the soils in that area are generally saturated from upstream flow (it does discharge into a sewer that travels down to the river at the bottom, but I guess the soils upstream would still be saturated during the rainy season). My questions are as follows:\n\n1. I'm aware that liquefaction can lead to uneven settlement, but is there typically potential for it to lead to a catastrophic failure of the building? It is a 4 story wood frame building on top of a concrete foundation (I don't have specifics for the foundation). The building was built in the 90s so I doubt liquefaction was taken into consideration.\n2. I'm worried about liquefied flow from the hill coming down and wiping out my building. I saw the liquefied flow in Indonesia and this obviously scares me. Is that mostly only possible along an unobstructed hillside such as with the Indonesia flow? Is it safe to assume the roads and upstream large concrete buildings with parkades and other major obstructions would make liquefied flow here unlikely?\n\nThank you for any responses.",

I have taken a number of control engineering courses, and I have fallen in the love with this specialisation. It is highly mathematical. However, there is a little problem.\n\nIn my country, engineering is not a good profession. It's not standardized. Furthermore, there is no form of engineering-based design, analysis, research, or development taking place both in the academic and industrial sector. Most engineers that I have met so far say that industrial operations in my country just deal with installation and maintenance of machinery and plants. There is nothing ingenious taking place that I know of, no 21st century fighter jet production, no semiconductor fabrication plants, not even a steel industry.\n\nTherefore, I find it hard to visualize the applications of the things that I learn in class. For example, how is the root locus technique used in automobile design? Also, how does control theory affect the stability of an helicopter? I was thinking that if the pilot flies in such a way that the closed loop poles of the helicopter's transfer function are on the Right Half Plane (RHP), then the helicopter will be unstable.\n\nI'm really trying to know how these concepts work in the real world. I will appreciate it if anyone can enlighten me.",
