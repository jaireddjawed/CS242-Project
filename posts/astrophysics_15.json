        "text": "Fair warning, Exact terminology may not be present. The following is based on what i remember from high-school math/science 10 years ago.\n\nFirst Big bang happens. Boom, stuff goes every direction in directionless space. My very limited knowledge of astrophysics, or physics in general would have me think will, objects in motion stay in motion unless acted upon by = or greater force. On earth such forces could include friction, drag, etc.  \n My understanding of space presently tells me that there is no friction or drag in space. For lack of better way to ask, if in the initial stuff to be \"banged\" we have a proto-Jupiter, how does for argument sake proto-Jupiter get sent north, only to find its way in an orbit around the sun? It seems like there was a pretty substantial change of direction involved?﻿\n  so 1) in absence of drag/friction how does an object start going north then \"hook a 90\" and go left in perpetual orbit\n  Stars I understood to be stationary.  Planets orbit, galaxy expands, etc. if the universe is expanding (moving) then everything including stars are moving.  I acknowledge my understanding and memories are probably not 110% correct, Im asking to learn. \n   so 1) How do double stars orbit each other if stars are stationary. \n       2) assuming stars are stationary how does the universe expand and the stars sort of stay at their present distances? (I also understand that the moon is moving slowly away from the earth to at some stupid slow rate?)\n\nThe best i can figure with my first question is that while there was one big bang and then probably several subsequent explosions, the collisions resulting from various explosions provided the opposing forces necessary to change the directions of various space stuff.",

Think of it as an infinite stack of papers, each paper infinite in size. This is the “true” universe. The science of parallel universes is unknown exactly, however it is thought that each universe may have similar or opposite qualities. Transport among each “layer” in the multiverse may also be possible. A black hole, caused by a supernova, may perhaps be a “rupture” in a layer. Black holes have a massive gravitational force, to the point of light having not enough velocity to escape. A black hole may be a “rupture” or “break” where we can access the infinite space outside of each “layer”. Since space is not a perfect vacuum, the space outside of each “layer” may, in fact, be a perfect vacuum. This being a perfect vacuum would cause very similar effects as gravity. Creating a black hole with a supernova is similar to ripping a hole in one of the papers of our stack. It can cause an object to “fall out” of a layer and potentially land onto another. The space outside of each layer is void of all matter, with the only thing in existence is electromagnetic presence, dark energy, and many other forms of energy. This energy could potentially break down the particles of an object as well, and transport them at immense rapidity to another part of the “layer”, thus causing wormhole-like transportation.\nLet the opinions and hate comments roll in...",

I do love physics though specifically astrophysics, I read and watch everything I can about the topic and understand some of it.\n\nI realize that in theory matter can not travel at the speed of light. I also understand that in theory we could travel at 99.999~% the speed of light. A few days ago I was having a discussion with my daughter about travel near the speed of light which if  a ship were built that could travel that fast the passengers on the ship age much more slowly than matter that is traveling at normal speed.\n\nShe asked a question that I could not answer so I bring it here.\n\nIf you are in a ship traveling near the speed of light lets say 99.99% and flew by a star that was big enough to go supernova just as it started to collapse would it seem to you that the supernova was happening in slow motion?\n\nThis might seem like an off the wall question and there may be a formula to figure it out, but that is one point where I get stuck on astrophysics, I understand some formula's but not others.",

I hope you'll bear with my ignorance.\n\nAs I understand it, the theory of dark matter came out of discrepancies between the observed motions in the universe and the visible mass those observed objects. Namely, certain galaxies seem to orbit one another faster than their visible mass could account for, hence dark (invisible to us) matter. \n\nI'm sure my understanding is pretty cursory, and that is likely why I'm having this question in the first place. I'm assuming my question has already been addressed by science and I'm hoping for an explanation about why this *isn't* the case.\n\nMy question is: Why isn't it possible that the light from the orbiting galaxies that we're observing (the ones that appear moving faster than they should be, given their visible mass) is somehow being distorted by strong gravitational fields? Or perhaps the image is somehow being distorted across the vast distances between our planet and those galaxies? Is there any chance that we're somehow observing a sped-up version of something that happened at \"real time\" long ago/far away/through a filter?\n\nAn analogy might be something like how our voices have a higher pitch when we inhale helium because sound travels faster in helium. It isn't a perfect analogy because c is constant, but maybe you get the idea...\n\nAnyway, pretty esoteric question, but I'm curious to know. Thanks!",

Maybe the black hole ruptures the fabric lining the perimeter of our universe and another one right next to it, hence using the same fabric or same wall, if you will, to separate the different universes from being one, singular plane of existence. And the density from the supernova drops down, tearing the fabric of our universe and whatever is near it (the event horizon) simply falls down into a literal, mundane hole, (well, not really mundane since it's going to be quite bigger than most mundane holes we usually encounter, like a hole dug by a dog, but still very mundane in terms of the structure and the way it works) and goes down the hole and into, and subsequently, onto the parallel universe right under it.",

What if the galaxies and other cosmic phenomena that we observe are reflections (like a mirage) of past iterations of our galaxy. In other words, what if there has only been one galaxy that has been born and died trillions, or zillions of times and what we are observing is the refection of that past light reflecting back at us from the edge of the universe. Is this theory plausible? \nI further pose:\nSince the universe is expanding it would theoretically take quite a while before we would see ourselves as a reflection.\nWhen we did see it (the reflection of us coming back out of the cosmos) it would be the moment of the birth of our galaxy (the sun is born) and then, if we had the camera technology available we could watch, day by day as our galaxy evolved. The only catch would be that what we are seeing would have originated from billions of years in the past and we might never realize that it was us. This assumes of course that the journey that the light takes isn't longer than the entire life cycle of our galaxy. If this were the case it would be a perfect example of: \"if a tree falls in the forest and know one is present to hear it fall did it make a sound?\"",

        "text": "Okay, first of all: I am neither really proficient in physics (I understand how they work, but I do not understand most formulas) nor am I an english native speaker. So I will try to be as precise as possible and not making a fool of myself, ideally both at once. But let's get to the point.\n\nAs far as I know, the mass of all objects in the Milky Way would not suffice to keep them together just by gravitation. So we assume dark matter - which has its own gravitation - in addition. Then this all works.\nSecondly, it seems that dark matter can be proven indirectly via the effect of gravitational lensing.\n\nThis is what brings me to my question:\n\nWhen observing distant galaxies, we can see a redshift or blueshift, depending on wether they move towards us or move away.\nIs there a possibility, that those galaxies might be static, but the light we observe of them is distorted by dark matter, just making it SEEM that they actually move away or towards us?\n\nI hope I made my thoughts somewhat clear - if not, please let me know and I will answer accordingly.\nAlso, if my question was not all too stupid and/or incompetent for the sciency people out there, I'd really appreciate some explanations where the mistake in my thoughts are - because I doubt I could come up with sciency breaking new just like that :)",

        "text": "Hello, my friends and I have been designing a fictional solar system that has essentially been created by an insanely advanced civilization. The idea is for it to be a binary system consisting of a star and a black hole. In orbit around these stars is a super-massive terrestrial disk, which has been terraformed to allow for human life. \n\nI have a lot of questions about this, and I was hoping to gain some insight on what would make this kind of system possible. First off, what kind of gravitational pull would a disk like this have? Would it need to be made of some special science-fiction material in order to hold together? At what distance from the star/black hole would the width of the disk need to be in order to be habitable for humans? What kind of star would allow for human life, how would x-rays from the black hole effect life on this disk? What kind of revolution around the star/black hole would the disk need to have in order to generate day/night cycles and seasons? Would it be possible for this disks to have satellites and if so what kinds of orbits could they have? \n\nThese are just the ones I'm coming up with immediately, but we want to really explore the details of something like this. I realize that it may be necessary to invent some science-fiction plot devices to make it possible, but we want to be as accurate as possible in designing how this system was created. We're assuming the civilization that built this has the technology required to traverse immense distances in space, manipulate whole planets/stars at a time, possibly on the edge of manipulating time. I gained a basic understanding of Kepler's laws long ago, but I'm currently getting a math major and have had a huge interest in astrophysics since I was very very young, so I can try to keep up with any formula people put forth but I'm not a physicist by any means.
