        "text": "I have such a great family, I'm getting a good degree at a good college, I have a great group of friends, I'm ambitious, hard-working, kind, etc (or at least, I hope!), yet because of years and years of feeling ugly and then finally having a \"glow-up\" and becoming attractive, nothing makes me feel better than looking good. \n\nBy that I mean, I literally derive the most joy out of life when I do my hair/makeup really well, get attention from men etc. It makes me so sad deep inside because I know I'm worth so much more than just my looks, and I want to be happier due to the other great reasons I have in my life to be happy about. I mean, other factors in my life do make me happy but my looks make me THE happiest. I'm 19-turning-20 soon, so I'm worried that after getting older (like when I start to lose my youthful looks), I'll be sad or depressed that I no longer have the thing that used to give me the greatest joy. \n\nAny tips on how to get over this, or will it just go away with time? I don't know if what I'm asking makes sense but **tl;dr** \\- I have a great life to be happy about (which I am happy about) yet, I am MOST happy when I feel like I look good, and it's what I derive greatest pleasure out of after years of being insecure. I'm worried about how this will impact me in the future.",

        "text": "So I have a sister that is about 10 years older than me. Despite the age difference, we’ve always been very close, best friends. \n\nHer birth mother has always been in the picture, as well as her maternal grandparents, but that’s it. Her relationship with them has just been very cordial, friendly, but not super close.  \n\nAnyway, recently I’ve been encouraging her to do a dna test (I think I was more interested than her!  Lol), because her birth mother wont give her any info on her father even though she has it all. She would only tell her it was a man in another country while she was working there and a first name, so at least we had that to go on when the test came back. She was able to connect with her birth dads family right away, like within a day. They put her in touch with her birth father and he was thrilled and said he’s always known about her and couldn’t find her all these years despite looking and been sending her messages non stop since then. So that’s great and I’m so happy and excited for her!  \n\nSo this is where the problem is, now that she’s been in touch with him, she found out she has 3 siblings and I’m kinda jealous?  Or maybe not jealous, but feeling left out a little and like I’m not as important to her now as her newfound biological siblings?  I obviously haven’t seen all the messages between her and her family, but a couple of the screenshots she’s sent me of their conversations, I’ve never seen her once mention me or our brother. I’m sure she has since I’ve just seen snippets, but I don’t know. \n\nI know I’m being selfish and feeling this way is very silly and I will get over it, but has anyone else ever been through this?  I’ve always thought about how adoptive parents might feel in these situations, but it never once occurred to me how a sibling may feel. \n\nI should add too that I’ve been struggling with infertility for a while and some of these new siblings also have kids, so she’s an aunt now, but not because of me. I know that could add to some of the way I’m feeling too.",

And the only reason I kept it so long was that the people I worked with were insanely supportive and able to help me out. \n\nI have since learned this is not the norm. \n\nI have had three jobs since then. \n\nAll of which I have lost due to being too slow to learn, taking things way too literally and not being able to prioritise my tasks properly (I am in the process of finding out if I have some kind of learning disability or ADHD or Autism or some combination of the three?)\n\nAnd. My mum literally said to me, ‘if I didn’t support you, would you be homeless?’\n\nI have said on multiple occasions ‘yes’. \n\nBecause I honestly don’t know how I would support myself. \n\nAnd it’s not just ‘hard’ and ‘complicated’ jobs. Though I do find the office jobs I have had to be too hard. But also a cashier job that I was fired from for similar reasons. \n\nIt doesn’t seem to matter how much I want to learn, I can’t remember. \n\nThen I get burnt out. Even in the one job I stayed in for two years. I burnt out. And, felt so tired after work, like I couldn’t do anything else. \n\nI think I did do other stuff, but whenever I try to balance my personal life with work. \n\nLike going out after work, I always inevitably get sick (with a flu) and end up having to take sick days. \n\nI tried to get into copywriting recently. But I genuinely hated it. \n\nI don’t know what to do? \n\nI couldn’t even remember recipes for a job I once had as a kitchen hand, without the recipe constantly in front of me. \n\nAnd none of this is from a lack of trying either. \n\nBut whenever I do a job I don’t like for too long, I genuinely get burnt out quickly. \n\nAnd, I am scared that sounds like an excuse. \n\nI’m honestly not sure anymore. \n\nI have recently started applying for part-time jobs. But I am not looking forward to it. Scared I’ll re-start the cycle of trying the hardest I can, then getting fired. \n\nOh well, wish me luck.",

I have 2 friends from high school and 1 from work that I made about 4 years ago. \n\nI’m married and we are both choosing to be child free. I also have a toxic relationship with my parents and have been diagnosed with ptsd from many events in my childhood and pretty much have all symptoms of Adult Child of Alcoholics. I’m friendly enough to see my parents on holidays but do not wish to have a deeper relationship as they have not changed and continue to trigger me. \n\nI’m stuck currently with this work friend. She hasn’t been around long enough to see how my parents effect me and believes one day I’ll change my mind and have kids. She says comments like “yeah and then you’ll have a baby and you’ll love it” because her experience of getting pregnant at 34 was right for her. \n\nRecently I mentioned a beach trip my siblings and I are taking with their kids. She mentioned wow you should invite your parents, it’ll be helpful and the kids will appreciate the memories. This is not my opinion, it will be chaos with their need to drink all day and black out for the evenings. Why would I want my nieces and nephews to be subject to the same “family trips” I had to grow up with. \n\nIf you’re still here, thanks…\nLooking for advice from other’s experiences or random thoughts. I really like this friend but I can feel it in my body when she makes comments about my personal experiences and choices. Do I confront it and see her reaction or is this a lost cause already? \n\nI enjoy this friend, her husband and kids but where’s this boundary I have to draw?",

The concept is that a company requires workers to separate your memories of life outside of work from your memories inside work.\n\nThe first episode starts with a woman lying on a table in a conference room unconscious. She's coming to and hears a man's voice coming from an intercom. The man asks the woman to answer 5 questions meanwhile, she is obviously in duress trying to escape the room finding the door to the conference room to be locked.\n\nIt rubbed me the wrong way. Much like how horror movies bother me where a woman is running from a killer or whatever. I was disturbed that they chose a woman character to illustrate how the intake process to this company, \"Lumon\" was. Maybe they thought it would be more \"entertaining.\" The first few people she meets are basically all men and she doesn't know why she's there.\n\nI feel like women were done a disservice by this intro scene. I'm kind of pissed by it. It hadn't even occurred to my husband how alarming this scene could be for a woman. It was very obvious to me a man wrote in a woman character without any input from a woman. I fucking hate it.\n\nSorry this was a borderline vent. Thoughts?\n\nTL:DR How do you feel about women being written into roles without any obvious input from a woman's perspective? Have you seen this particular episode? How did you feel about it?",

Feel free to answer the question without reading but if you’re curious about why I’m feeling this way, here is my backstory:\n\nI’m finally ending a toxic friendship with my “best friend” that I realize has impacted my self-esteem for years. I also have a job I truly should not have been hired for - it’s not imposter syndrome, I was hired for one skillset but am expected to have an entirely different one that I’ve been very upfront about not having. I don’t even seem to have the aptitude to learn it despite trying for hours outside of work (was hired in a non-technical role at a tech company but am expected to understand complicated code with zero training.) I’ve told my doctor that I think I genuinely have brain damage post-Covid because my long and short term memory is completely shot so I’m getting a nueropsych assessment in a few months - but it’s obviously making it hard to learn a new skillset. I have a lot of anxiety about it because I’m the breadwinner by $40k and we live in a HCOL area. \n\nI just feel like I need to regain my confidence especially since I think the adage of “you have so much confidence in your 30s compared to your 20s” is simply not true for me - in my 20s I could care less about financial stability, worked jobs I was passionate about, took exciting risks and traveled solo a lot. I had always been quick-witted/intelligent and felt like I could rely entirely on myself but now every decision causes me to freeze. I’ve also gained a ton of weight to the point where I’m morbidly obese when I used to be very athletic (was a top performer in my state in two different sports.)\n\nSo here I am, I’m married with a kid in my late 30s and feel like I’ve lost all sense of my former self. It wasn’t like this when I first had a kid but the pandemic kind of broke me. I need so much help at home from my husband (I stopped driving during the pandemic and get anxious every time I try to restart) and I need so much help at work. It just makes me feel like a useless waste of space and like a child.\n\nI’m trying to take proactive steps. I’m doing a weight loss program, I’m trying to think through how I would start my own business if/when I’m fired, and I’ve been trying to drive short distances with my husband in the passenger seat. \n\nMy job is still going to be a problem for a while - at least until I save up enough to quit or until I get laid off (and it pays really well.) I’m trying really hard to just push through and not let it impact me.\n\nI know I need therapy (I’ve been trying to find a new therapist after my old one retired.) but if anyone here has advice on how they regained their confidence, I’d love to hear it.",

Both my parents worked so I never had quite the same concept of ‘clean’ as my husband did. \n\nMy husband loses his mind basically every Saturday morning. Says I’m unhygienic, disgusting, don’t do anything with my time because for example I’ll leave some hair elastics out throughout our place or I won’t perfectly clean the inside of the oven throughout the week. I’d understand this behaviour if I literally did nothing but keep in mind I cook all of our meals, keep things up to my standard of clean and do all the dishes/laundry. \n\nHe claims things being out of place make him anxious. Any sort of ‘mess’ makes him anxious. But AITA for thinking I’m not his effing maid? I’m not his mom, either. Genuinely, our place is never messy, but it his version of messy. It’s really starting to weigh on me because he full out insults me week after week about how he  works so much more than me so I should have the time to keep things perfect. Like he goes really low and even threatens to leave me. He’ll say my upbringing was so poor so that’s why I am the way that I am. I don’t consider his behaviour or the way he talks to me normal. It’s not like he pays all my bills (or any of them) and we had an agreement that I’ll do XYZ. \n\nAnyways I don’t know what to do or what to think. Thoughts?",

        "text": "Hey all, I’m struggling, and could use some support. \nLast year, I (32 F) flew all the way across the country to get away from my LTR cheating ex. I was severely gaslit, and I’ve since began therapy to address the trauma. I swore up and down that I’d never love or date anyone again. The loss of him was too great to bare, and I truly believed I’d never find a man like him. Well, when I moved last year, I found a new sense of excitement. I got to start over and build my life back up from scratch. I got a great job, good housing, and slowly meeting friends. Sure, I still had reminders of the past and was sad, but it helped to be no contact. I met someone .. and he really set the standard. He was kind, gentle and giving. He came from a good family. He had good friends. He challenged me to think and open my mind. When we met , we had so much to talk about , and we kept meeting. I knew I made a new best friend. While I wasn’t ready to date yet, we remained friends for many months. 2 months ago, we began being romantic and tried dating. For Christmas he gave me a letter from his journal saying that he wanted to marry me. I began believing that I could see a future with another man for the first time in years and I fell hard. I trusted him, he was an honest man and practiced this, knowing that I had been cheated on. Well, relationships change the dynamic- I see my part in it. I was anxious, and triggered by innocent things. I needed reassurance for what he thought was too much. He would react when I didn’t show him affection sometimes (sometimes I just don’t want to be touched). We’d have our conflicts, to which he said I over compensated. I believe in the emotional bank account so yes, I wanted to make things right. I will own that when we’d have our fights I would question the relationship, and I’m not proud that I did. I was hurt before and I was afraid he didn’t believe in me. He gave me a few chances, but continued to say that he was on the emotional roller coaster with me. I can’t tell if it’s me, or him that cannot handle general relationship talks. I mean, outside of our relationship we were great friends and we had each others backs. So why didn’t it feel like this dating? It feels like he gave up on us too soon. He said he saw a future in me, and believed it . Knowing that I come from trauma, and wanting to start our relationship right, we got into couples counseling but only had 1 session before he broke up. \n\nThis feels particularly hard for many reasons: he set the standard for me. He was a good one. I fell in love with my best friend, after I thought I couldn’t. I thought we’d get married. We have shared goals and values. I’m trying not to base my self worth on this breakup. It feels like the asshole cheating ex didn’t want me, and now the good guy didn’t want me. If I can’t get the good guy, what does it say about me? I don’t feel good enough. I can’t stomach knowing that he’s going to date and marry someone else. We are still friends to some degree, but that’s met with a degree of pain , because he was my friend and support. I have no family or other friend group since I’ve only lived here a year. I’m trying to make new friends. And on a side note, he couldn’t keep his apartment clean (blames his adhd/depression) nor has he ever learned how to drive, so he doesn’t drive or own a car. I’m crying myself to sleep, and I wake up in tears.I feel like I lost a good guy despite those things. \n\nThank you for reading, I just needed to get this all off my chest.",

I was enjoying the food but they kept talking about how this was an “indulgence” for them and they stopped eating MUCH more quickly than I did. I felt almost shamed about how much I was eating and enjoying it. It didn’t bother me because I kept eating but the whole thing was super weird. Like I don’t want to eat the nachos YOU ordered while you tell me that you hardly ever eat cheese and you’ll have to work out extra later. They know I’m not as into fitness as them so… what the heck? I love these people but I wish they wouldn’t pick the food apart. I responds by saying well, this is really good and I’m going to keep eating! And they were like yeah go for it! So it wasn’t a bad experience but it felt kind of bad and confusing to see them so stressed about the food. I just felt like they were watching me eat too and kind of, idk, measuring it? Sigh.",

I don't have a problem with asking if he'd like to see me for the third date and I do this 50:50 in conversations. I wanted to ask, what were your texting/calling habits in the very beginning of dating with people you successfuly got in a relationship with? On the rational level my approach doesn't seem to be bad, as I am not clingy, but at the same time you can read in many places that men love to hunt... I don't know, what to do to keep a man, and I don't think it's a matter of looks or conversations, because a lot of people find me phisically attractive, funny and a great interlocutor. HELP!",

I’ve been in several long-term relationships in my adult life and generally haven’t had an issue finding a good partner and happy relationship.

I went on lots of dates, but considered myself single for about 2 years. Then I met my most recent partner and we both felt that this relationship was “it” for us. But over time, it was clear that it wasn’t. That relationship only lasted 10 months (my shortest ever) and just ended. \n\nI think I’m feeling so many types of sadness…sad that this relationship is over, because although I know it’s not right for me, it hurts to part ways when there’s still love…sad that I will be “starting over” in looking for a life partner at almost 34…and sad that I thought I would’ve been better at “picking” after several generally happy long term relationships and therapy throughout my life, yet I ended up picking a very difficult relationship that didn’t last very long, relatively speaking.\n\nI’d really just love some hope from people who found their person in their mid-to-late 30s. 💜 Especially if you’d had a previously difficult relationship before finding your person. If I look at the “data” of my life, then I know that finding another mate is probable…yet I still feel fear that I won’t find someone I can genuinely imagine spending my life with, as I haven’t found them yet. \n\nThank you. 💗",

There is no chemistry as i can feel, but maybe it's due to the heavy nature of the topics (deal breakers, cheating, etc). \n\nHe seems unnaturally concerned about his future wife being disrespectful to his parents, which is ???? cause i don't think normal people would worry about that? Like, i assume that a partner will be reasonably respectful to my parents, as i to his. He also seems to be of \"family is family and we must work through all issues and remain cordial at all cost\" thought, and well, idk why but it really ick me. I have a happy family, i love my parents, but something about that way of thinking feels red flag to me. Some of what he said feel victim-blaming to me (ex: if a wife keeps on nagging her husband, obviously he will cheat). He tried to back pedal that he will divorce before cheating, but idk, I'm skeptical. \n\nHe also has no hobbies and considers some of my hobbies (he doesn't know i like them) time waster. Is that normal for people to have no hobbies? I'm guessing no creative hobbies, maybe, but my friends usually at least read, play sports or visit cafés. Do some people just really have no discernable interests beside studying more for their job?\n\nAll in all, i feel like I'd prefer being single than dating/married after the date. Thing is, i had the same feeling after a speed dating event before. Could it be I'd been single for so long so i don't understand the constraints of a relationship? Is my feeling because i never get used to dating/married life, or is it because of the particular men I met? Is a relationship supposed to feel so heavy and burdensome? \n\nI won't lie, i can be kind of dramatic sometimes, so I'm worried that i overthink and overreact. My judgment of people is usually not as strong as others, so possibly I'm missing things/reading too much too. My brain says give it another or 2 dates before deciding, but i have a strong impulse to cut it now. Would it be too hasty? What would you ladies do?",

I knew I had to settle, but not as much. The worst thing is that I won't be able to move for some time. I'm disabled and don't have support. Those who helped me are vanishing. I'm also not from the USA, if it matters. \n\nSo, those of you who settled, or just don't like things in your place, can you tell me about them? How do you cope? Thanks.",

Unlike all our previous arguments, this time I stood my ground and did not feed her ego by making up. We haven't spoken in two months and I honestly feel relieved. \n\nThis end of the friendship acted as a catalyst for me as it gave me the much-dreaded look of what life looks like after choosing yourself and putting your needs in a dynamic. I had been so afraid of the end and what comes after it that I let people stay for longer than they needed to. \n\nCut to now, I have successfully ended four previous complicated situation-ships that had been lingering for two years by actually initiating the end. It feels surreal and fucking liberating. I have five fewer people to walk on eggshells around.",

I just simply put up with a lot of things not in a doormat kind of manner . There were numerous occasions any sane person would respond differently? In all the below scenarios I wanted to breakup with him, but I didn't, I thought it would get better.\n\n1. He works as an ER doc, so I just assumed he probably has not enough free time like me and I was adjusting to a lot of his schedule. He only planned the first date, rest was all done by me \n\n2. I had a festival at home which I invited him to so he could meet my mom, he mentioned how he didnt want to cancel his D&amp;D game for me, I was very mad at him and had a conversation with him. I even later explained to him how this festival is equivalent to Christmas. After all this talk, he showed up late because he was \"still playing\". I was absolutely mad at him for his behavior and did tell him how disappointed I was. He always says \"I don't know what to say\" later he said sorry on text \n\n3. Once he made me drive home at 2am after not offering to let  me sleep in his place, I pushed to sleep on the couch and later I decided I just wanted to go home. This is despite me telling him I have slept while driving at night \n\n4. In the sexual department, he didn't really bother to pay attention to my needs or even bother to ask me what I liked or take an effort to satisfy me.\n\nThere are numerous other situations! In hindsight he barely put effort in any aspect of our adult relationship. Well like how the relationship was in his terms always, he also decided to end it.\n\nYou see - the problem here is that I am a smart, independent woman who is an Engineer and makes a 6 figure salary, financially secure , own my place and all that shit. I am fairly attractive, have a nice face and a decent body; I ain't no model but I am fine. The day he broke up with me, I sat there heartbroken and looked like an idiot. Idk how I became this woman I am describing, I obviously had issues with him, but I didn't have the skill to communicate effectively to him, I didn't have the guts to tell him this won't work, I was so desperate to make this some how work and get married (I am 38), I just went on and on. I also come from a culture where it's normal for the woman to adjust/compromise. My sister, my mom, my friend they all just told me to focus on his positive side, look how that ended!\n\nIt all comes down to low self-esteem, I really don't know how to work on that. Is there anyone who can relate to me and who worked on themselves and became a different person?",

So, I’m a 34 F ( divorced 3years, single ever since)and this January I had to have an emergency surgery (sbo) it was a nightmare I’m now, finally, a lot better. Before that I was very fit and confident with my body, I was finally on my best shape after struggling for many years with body image issues. Before the surgery there was a guy at gym I was interested on, but honestly it is difficult for me bc I am shy, every time we had eye contact I’d look away but than lately we were saying hi. I’d like to have to have time and a proper conversation but I wasn’t sure it would ever happen. Anyways, yesterday I was finally able to go back to lifting weights and have a light workout and I met him when I was leaving the gym, he was with his kid, we said hi and he told the kid to go in and he came talk to me, I sort of panicked, he said he hasn’t seen me for a long time and was wondering what happened, so I told him and he asked my number, said to keep contact and go out sometime, that was pretty much it, it was cold outside. He texted me today and want to go out tomorrow, I honestly don’t feel confident anymore, I understand how shallow that sounds and that my body shouldn’t matter that much but it does, I look at the mirror and it’s hard to accept how I look now and the scar is huge. Should I tell him something about this or just go with the flow and see how it goes first",

        "text": "So just a little back story. My sister caused me a bit of trauma in childhood. She had a terrible temper and we sort of walked on eggshells around her. I was younger than her whereas my parents and other sister didn't have to deal with that power dynamic. \n\nShe was pretty awful to me and honestly as an anxious person who hated yelling, I sort of developed this really strong wall where I appeared fine on the outside and could take it but she really hurt me.\n\nShe has taken some accountability for it, not actually apologizing but since early adulthood she has made efforts to hang out and mend fences. The difficulty is she is fight and I am flight response. I find it really hard to trust her because one day she may perfectly personable and another day she may not.\n\nSince having kids she has improved a lot and genuinely seems to have become a better person. She's going through a divorce right now and has three kids, 7 and under, so a lot on her plate. She hasn't addressed a lot of her emotional issues and is just in survival mode due to a lot of impulsive decisions she's made in her life. \n\nI don't wish her any hard and I feel badly for her and want to help but it's so hard when she has a bad day, like today and just invalidates everything I say. The old bullied and bullier dynamic comes out. Every comment I make is \"obvious\" or incorrect for some reason. In this mood she becomes the contrarian to everything I say. I say the pool is cold, she says it's not at all. That kind of thing. I know she doesn't have the bandwidth for a come to Jesus moment with me. I don't have that bandwidth either. I just want to know how I can deal with her in these moments while still respecting my own boundaries. After several jabs (or what felt like jabs) she made another invalidating comment like \"that's so obvious\" about something I had said I just realized social constructs were exactly that. And I responded \"well I'm proud of myself for realizing that\" and she took issue with that and didn't understand my response. She said \"I agreed with you!\" I said that she had responded in a way that suggested it wasn't a great realization and wasn't very validating. \n\nThe good news is it didn't escalate and she went to do something and we acted as if nothing happened. That's also something that got to me a lot as a child. She would blow her stack and be over it in five minutes, meanwhile I'd be spending days steaming. \n\nBasically to recap TLDR how do you hold space for yourself with a person who doesn't know how to connect emotionally with you and who can  lash out and really hurt you? I'm not interested in cutting her out of my life. I keep her at arm's length as that's really the only strategy that's worked.",

        "text": "I met a guy and we hit it off. So we've been getting to know each other, it's still early and no sex / relationship yet. We have decent chemistry, we seem compatible, and we get along amazingly well. \n\nI'm concerned about his emotional availability. He has not had many romantic / sexual partners, which in and of itself is fine. But in his case, it's because he doesn't feel worthy of affection and love. Most women start to get to know him and then put him in the friend zone. He has many female friends. He seems to be a giving, open, in-tune, and lovely man. \n\nI met him playing a show with a rocker chick. I spoke to them afterwards and hit it off with both of them. He was sure to clarify that they're not dating. He later told me that she's taken and with a partner who she had been with before and reunited with last year. \n\nSo, this dude was the in-between guy. It sounds like he and rocker chick had sex, she ghosted him, and then called him up when she had life problems. He's been there as a friend and support person ever since then. \n\nWhen I asked if he'd want her if she were to break up with her partner, he said that she wouldn't want him and he's not her type. I said, I'm asking about what you would want, not her. And he said that he wants someone who wants him. He is so very open that he never actually pursues women. He just sees who wants to be with him, which so far hasn't really been anyone. \n\nHe feels doomed to a life of solitude and service. \n\nWhat do you make of all this my ladies?",

        "text": "I moved to south Florida several years ago, but never made any friends. I moved from Philly and was able to take the job with me, so I have been working from home.\nI decided to get my masters and actually go to in person classes at night to try to meet some people, and I did, but I didn’t really get to make friends. \nI also started dating a guy, and we did everything together. So for the last few years I have been okay because I had someone to do all kinds of things with….. after a little over 4 years I had to make the hardest decision ever 2 weeks ago, and I had to let him go, even though I love him sooooo much. \n\nOur relationship turned a little toxic, and ending it was the right thing to do. He keeps contacting me and is like he doesn’t want to understand that I said that it is over. He stopped showing interest in me, he stopped showing me that I was a priority (like I once was), and after constantly pushing me away I ended it, but he doesn’t want to let me go. \n\nIt is so confusing! The first week I cried like a baby, every single day. The second week was a little better. I was still very sad and disappointed, but I finally stopped crying….. and last night he said that he can’t let me go…. So, I am confused. How do you treat someone “you love” so cold, but you don’t want to let go??? \n\nI have ZERO self power, I haven’t been able to block him…. Even though I know that I should do that. \n\nI am currently sitting at a restaurant having a late lunch/ early dinner on my own… and I feel so awkward….. I went through a divorce before because my ex husband cheated, so I know that I will be okay. I know that it will take time (just like before), but I had all my best friends around me, and now that I’m here all alone….. I’m scared that this process of feeling okay again will take a while.",

Everything about it, from the busy work to shitty group projects to having to teach myself most of the time, has left a sour taste in my mouth. My plan is to never set foot inside of a university classroom ever again after I graduate with my Bachelor’s. But the common question everyone asks me is if I plan on getting my Masters degree. I always say “god no!”, but now I wonder if I am shooting myself in the foot from not entertaining the idea. So I guess what I’d like to ask is, are graduate degrees absolutely necessary?

        "text": "Question for my ladies of the Reddit. This isn't really women specific but I literally have no idea who/where else to ask and this group gives such thoughtful and compassionate advice. Tldr at the bottom cause this is kinda long.\n\nI was born and still live here in Toronto Canada, however my parents are from another country. My mom's whole family is here now and has been for all their adult lives but on my Dad's side, him and I are the only ones here. All the rest of my paternal family is from/still lives in California. \n\nEveryone is always like woo Cali must be nice but seriously it's not. It's far af. And my family does not live in the fun part of California. They live in the plain boring country part that you don't see on tv/movies and it's a b*tch to get there (fly for 6 hrs then drive for 4hrs into the country).\n\nMy Dad's brother passed away last month and I feel bad, I have guilt and regrets that I never went back to see him and didn't call him before he died. The funeral/celebration of life is in 2 weeks and I'm debating going. Well I'm pretty sure I'm going. He was my favorite uncle and I loved him very much. He has sent me so many paintings, drawings and tapes/CDs of his music over the years. Even though I grew up and the distance made it hard, he was still very special to me. That's why I have these feelings of guilt and regret.\n\nI'm not particularly close with my mom's family here. They're toxic AF and I always felt like I never fit in with them so even though I didn't go often, those trips to see my dad's family were very meaningful experiences in my life. I had lots of childhood/teenage visits but once I was out on my own I didn't go back as much as I would've liked. It's hard cause I have big dogs and my husband and I work for ourselves which makes it hard to get away when no one can cover for you. Also it's expensive and a huge undertaking to get to these people and whenever I did manage to get a vacation, I needed a vacation, not a mission. Also when you've been to a place so many times, well I guess it's hard to choose to spend the 1 trip every 4-5 years on that same old boring place. But now I wish I'd just sucked it up and done the mission. It's confusing. I don't know what to do with all the feelings. \n\nK next issue - I've been so so so many times, but this time I'll be taking my husband with me. I only took him once before, and we didn't have many days because of work/dogs/no money. We went straight from the airport to family and we spent the days with family then went back to the airport. He literally saw nothing of California, we didn't do anything touristy at all cause there's nothing touristy to do out in the middle of nowhere. After that trip he has said it feels weird for him to say he's been to California cause people are like oh did you go to LA or San Fran and he literally went to an apartment building, a diner and a Walmart somewhere out in the country then came home. \n\nHe is absolutely supportive and says if we do that again he's totally ok with it but I feel like if we're gonna spend all the money, time and effort to go that far, shouldn't I try and take him somewhere fun? But all the fun stuff is far from where my family lives and we'd only be adding time onto a 4.5 hr drive from the airport to their town so like is it even worth it? Or is this just par for the course when you marry someone with family in another country? \n\nI don't know who else to ask about this. My circle is entirely people who have both sides of their family here. My husband is a straight Toronto-boy, his big Italian family lives close, within 5min to 45min from our place. He has no idea what it's like to have half your people a world away. \n\nSo I guess I'm wondering how other people with family abroad do it. How do you deal with the distance and all the feelings?\n\n\nTldr: I live in Toronto and have to go to my uncle's funeral in California. I have all these conflicted feelings. Guilt about not going to visit more and feelings of frustration about how much of a mission it is to get to where my family lives. How do other people handle all the feelings and logistics of having family in another country?",

I've been suffering through burnout as I've been working and studying non-stop with no break so I decided to take some time off to figure out what I want to do. I decided I value my health and work/life balance over the money I was making. \n\nI'm thinking about going back to school and maybe pursuing a Phd in psychology to maybe become a professor or a psychologist since I was always interested in the field and possible try to study abroad. I'm really worried I might be making a mistake and not be able to have a stable career path or struggle to find a job afterwards or maybe even end up disliking the path as well.\n\nI'm just really lost on how to know what path is the right one for you. I don't want to keep making the same mistakes over and over again and end up unhappy. I know I'm still young but I really do want to be able to leave my hometown as COVID has made me stuck here far longer than I would've wanted to. And I want to be able to financially support myself and not dread going into work everyday. \n\nIf anyone has any advice I'd really appreciate it.

I couldn't figure out what it was for the longest time. I recently had a conversation with my mother who told me she felt the same way I did, and she felt that a lot of the tension came from my husband. According to her, when he walks in the door there's \"a wave of discomfort and a sense that he doesn't want to be there\". She said that she likes him fine, but that sense of oddness is starting to become frustrating.\n\nTo be fair to her, my husband is very shy and awkward around my family. According to him it's not that he doesn't like them, he just can't seem to relax. We've been together for 7 years and married for 2 and he still doesn't like being in a room I'm not in. He's a bit on the spectrum so I'm inclined to give him grace in social situations, but the man is a high school teacher and while he does interact better with the kids than the parents, he can be very funny and charming in other social situations with people our age. I've talked to him about it, and he says that he wishes he didn't feel so awkward but he's not really sure what to do.\n\nI told my mom to just talk to him one-on-one and clear the air. I don't know if it'll actually fix anything but I'm at a loss on my end. \n\nHave any of you dealt with odd dynamics between an SO and your family? How did they resolve?",

I have loved my time in London and have made some wonderful life long friends but I feel like I have outgrown it and it's time to move on. \n \nMy reasons for leaving are: \n1) The cost. London has always been expensive and it only ever gets worse. When I first moved here I was in a decent house share for less than £500 a month. Now it's impossible to find somewhere semi decent for less than £800 (bills not included).\n \n2) My job. The costs go up but my salary doesn't. I came here originally for uni which I loved but I haven't been able to find a job/career I enjoy since graduating. I feel like I am working constantly in a job I hate to pay for rent I can barely afford. \n \n3) I'm sick of seeing tarmac. Everyone talks about how nice the parks are here, and they're OK but I'm from Yorkshire, AKA God's own country. I miss seeing moors, hills, sheep, rivers, lakes, etc. \n \n4) I want to meet someone and settle down. I've met my fair share of guys here but I think London has a tendency to attract men who are just looking for the next big thing, and that includes their next woman. I know men who don't want to commit are all over the world but this is an experience all my female friends in London share. It's not my main reason for leaving but it is one of them. \n \n5) This might sound dumb to people but idc. My cat passed away in November. I am still struggling to cope with the grief and the lack of nature, working in a job I hate, etc. has made it difficult to heal. I think I would benefit from going home, walking in nature, and having time to myself will help me.\n \n\nSo my plan is to move back home and live with my parents for a while. I want to be self employed and have wanted to do this for a long time but the pressure of paying extortionate rent rates have kept me in full time employment. I have ADHD and have trouble organising myself so while I have tried to start my own business on the side, it's time I admit that my disability makes it near impossible to have the energy/organisation skills to work 40+ hours a week *and* grow a business. \n \nI am a bit wary of moving back in with my parents. It feels shameful and like a failure. I am trying to see it as a way to help me progress but I know it'll be difficult to adjust. Has anyone else done this? Do you think it was the right decision?",

I had a massive crush on him in college, so I thought this was a fairytale romance.\n\nLong story short he was just a huge fucking prick. I know the word gaslighting is thrown around a lot now but that's what he really would do. Our fights were explosive because we'd just go in circles and he'd make shit up that didn't happen and then I'd just start exploding and hitting myself because I couldn't control my rage. Then of course after hours of crying, he'd love bomb and cuddle me after. It was a horrible cycle and I finally moved out last summer into my own bachelor 1.5 hours away near my friends.\n\nBut ever since then, I still talk and see him. He'll drive down once or twice a month for the weekend to hang out. I just can't seem to stop. I get so lonely, and one good thing I could say about our relationship is our cuddle movie sessions. Or we go on hikes together. Out to dinner. Etc. I miss all that so much, so he'll come over and we'll do all of that. Our sex life was dead before I even moved so we don't even have sex, we just cuddle and eat snacks and watch tv together and it's blissful.\n\nBut of course I want to start dating again with other people, and I know I can't keep doing this. But I can't stop. On weekends when I have no plans and he's not here, the loneliness just hurts so much.\n\nI've been on a few dates recently with someone and I just can't get that spark with him (or others I've been on dates with) I just can never see us comfortably at that stage I am with with my ex. I just hate dating in general, I hate the beginning stage where I need to put on my best self to impress when all I really want to do is lay in bed together watching a movie as he's rubbing my back lol. Something my ex would always do for me without even being asked to. And I know that stage will eventually come with someone but I'm impatient and skeptical of everyone. \n\nI haven't spoken to my ex in a week because of course we had a tiff over something so stupid, and we got into a texting fight where we both stopped texting. It's been a week, and I tried so so hard to not text him and take this opportunity to wash my hands off with this nonsense but no, I'm weak and I just texted him and opened up a communication line again. This has happened so many times that I always think \"fuck, okay the next fight we have, I'll officially walk away\" but one painful deep wave of sad and loneliness and I'm reaching for my phone without hesitation. \n\nDoes/has this happened with anyone else? How pathetic am I? I can't stop this, and I don't think I'll be able to for a while, if ever, and I don't see him walking away either because he doesn't really have anyone either.",

Another couple has invited us over to their house for dinner and then canceled the day of for various reasons, usually because someone in the family is ill.\n\nOne of the couples rescheduled immediately and we had dinner with them the following Friday. Another couple did not reach out to reschedule. The third couple canceled today but they are our relatively close friends so we imagine they will reschedule soon.\n\nEach time I have been more relieved than annoyed they canceled on us! I don’t know if I would feel the same way if we were supposed to have dinner at a restaurant, but for some reason I’m always nervous about having dinner at people’s homes unless I know them very well. \n\nDoes anyone else feel this way?",

        "text": "Hi! So I've mostly left my leg and armpit hair alone for the last decade. I sometimes got my legs waxed, but mostly let it grow. \n\nLately I've really come to be more comfortable with my body on average and I've decided that this spring/summer I'd like to have my legs hairless. Men can decide they'd like a beard at one point and a clean shave at another. I shouldn't feel bound to either be \"hairy society rejecting wild child\" or \"slave to the unbalanced societal expectations.\" Also, ticks are less attracted to hairless spots and I love in a rock heavy area so anything to detour them while I'm hiking is a plus.\n\nBut, with a child now I can't afford to get my legs waxed regularly, and when I used to shave I was prone to terrible razor burn and ingrowns. The shaving issue was part of why I let my leg hair grow in the first place. And ingrown hairs happened when I got waxed, too. Part of my challenge is(was?) my leg hair is dark and tends to grow back quickly so I would go over the same spot with a razor several times and waxing often missed hairs so I'd pluck those and then they'd come back ingrown.\n\nSo I'm looking for help.\n\nIs there a way to shave and actually get clean looking legs and avoid razor burn and ingrown hairs? Do I need to shave with a particular razor or shave cream? Should I use a pumice bar like the \"hair eraser\" or a chemical like Nair a couple times a week? It has literally been over six years since I shaved. \n\nThank you. 🙏",

        "text": "I have an amazing gig right now. I'm an engineer working part-time remotely, 3-4 hours of work a day max, making $80K a year. I have plenty of time for hobbies, friends, and honoring spiritual practices (which is very important to me). I have no stress from work, and rarely have to talk to people. I truly love my life right now but this didn't come easy. I was overly ambitious all my life and burned out 2 years ago, which prompted me to find an easier job to be able to build the *lifestyle* I actually want; I realized money wasn't everything, and that what I do with my time is much more important. \n\nAlso, this easy job has enabled me to pursue a pipe dream of mine - which is to become a freelance  photographer. I'm finally taking courses in photography, and feel pretty hopeful about booking photoshoots soon. \n\nA former client of mine (who knew me in my ambitious phase) just gave me an incredible offer. The salary is great, but I'm more excited by the role itself. It sounds much more exciting than my current job (which I dread doing). It's not an engineering role - it's actually more client-facing and strategy-focused, which is what I used to do in a previous role. I would have total autonomy (reporting to the CEO), there would be fun travel involved, and it's in an industry that I find fun and exciting. But if I take this job, I have to give it *my all.* They are a 50-person startup with significant funding and pressure to succeed. They're expecting all of me. \n\nAlong with the pressure and stress, I'd also basically be in meetings all day. I am great at speaking to clients, but I find it equal parts energizing and draining... if that makes sense. I have anxiety, so some days I wake up and am *so relieved* I don't have to take any meetings. With this new role, I'd probably have crucial client-facing meetings every day. \n\nThe salary is 170K plus stock (which could become very valuable if the company takes off, and they are already very successful early on). I would get a raise to 200K after 1 year. \n\nDo I need the money? Not really.. I don't believe in living beyond your means, and am doing fine on 80K a year. I have about 10K of CC debt I'd like to pay off asap. Beyond that, I'd probably spend the new money on donations, my parents, and save the rest. \n\nI'm really torn between staying at my wonderful, cozy, stress-free job that allows me to pursue my passions in life vs. taking this exciting new opportunity that would be a lot more fun work-wise and more than double my income. \n\nThank you in advance to the wonderful women here who I can always rely on as a sounding board.",

        "text": "Double whammy question. Lately, I've been going through it.\n\nI had a 10+ year friendship end abruptly four years ago and it still fucks me up. She was my best friend and was supposed to be the MOH in my wedding, until she ended our friendship over text the day before my birthday and the day I was going to ask her to be in my wedding. Her reasons were insane, so I won't get into that, but I did nothing to cause this friendship to end. While I know in retrospect that she was actually a terrible friend and person, had little to no respect for me and boundaries, and had very unhealthy (toxic) ideologies, it still sort of hurts these years later. It recently has come up again because I had a falling out with a mutual friend. Said friend and I were close until they sided with my ex-bff and assumed that I caused our friendship to end. Since then I have put a lot of distance in that friendship, but they continue to reach out. This week I decided to open up a conversation to discuss my feelings and that I was still hurt/saddened/confused by the treatment they gave me when my ex-bff ended our friendship. It's been crickets and I think I've been ghosted. I was not nearly as close with this person as the other, but they were a very close friend and it hurts. So I am grieving two significant relationships, and I just don't know how I can fully get over it. I feel with both I have no been able to gain closure.\n\nSince losing ex-bff I have felt so sad because now I do not have a \"best girl friend,\" and this breaks my heart. I have two best male friends and I am truly so lucky to have them, but I long to have what I had with my ex-bff. I have close female friends, but I'm not sure we will get on that level... It's hard for me to think that I may never have a female friendship like what I had with ex-bff (I don't have a sister, so I can't really rely on the built-in bestie thing). Anyways, it sucks, but I'm trying to not get too disheartened. Maybe it's possible to find someone at this stage in life, but it seems difficult because the formative years are over and people just don't have the same time to commit to friendship, at least from what I've seen. \n\nSo I guess my questions here are. How did you recover from losing your best friend, especially if there was no closure? What has been your experience building best friends in your 30s?",
