I've got an internship lined up over the coming summer as part of my graduation requirements but I was wondering what everyone here does over the winter? I'll be working for an engineering group that operates a branch of land management but even the full time employees are only working from March to October, that leaves a large gap in pay and obviously bill don't stop just because you aren't working. So I'd love to hear from anyone with professional or career experience on working through winter. I'm in Illinois for reference and maybe this company is just unique, could just I haven't been around long enough to know any better.",

As the title says, 3 marathons will be run in 3 days for the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, however it won't be done by me. It will be done by my friend and fellow MSc classmate here in Australia. Here are some details about his mission!\n\n\"Hello! My name is Rankin and I am a postgraduate student at James Cook University, Cairns Campus pursuing my MSc in Zoology and Ecology. I have a passion for wildlife and conservation, but I also have a passion for running! My hope is to integrate these two passions of mine to demonstrate and to inspire others to think of creative ways get involved and create positive impacts in their community.\n\nAll the money raised in this fundraiser will be donated to the Great Barrier Reef Foundation (GBRF). Established in 2000, the mission of GBRF is to protect and “ensure a Great Barrier Reef for future generations” by funding scientific research and projects for the benefit of the Reef. My goal for this fundraiser is $1,500; for every dollar, 85 cents directly funds research projects to project the Reef and 15 cents enables the Foundation to operate and covers all administrative costs. For more information, visit www.barrierreef.org.\n\nThe most important component and platform of this project is the fundraiser page that is already connected to the GBRF: https://give.everydayhero.com/au/3-marathons-in-3-days-for-the-great-barrier-reef. Please consider donating to this fundraiser page or share the link to friends, family, and social media platforms to support this cause and the GBRF.\"\n\nThat's just a quick breakdown of the mission but if you have any questions feel free to ask! Thanks for looking!\n",

So, for my project (which will last 2 years) I am working my cellular and molecular biology professor and the Herpetology professor to collect girls data in both Guthrie and Snake Fungal Disease (SFD). I contacted someone from the Pennsylvania Amphibian and Reptile Survey (PARS) due to finding out they are collecting swabs in hope to confirm the lack of or presence of chytrid. \n\nI have also looked on the site BD maps  which tracks locations of Guthrie both confirmed and sites that tested negative but, they have almost no information for P.A. but have us listed as having over 200 cases with only 5 locations or so viewable. Does anybody know if any other organizations that are collecting data on this I could contact? Any help is going to be greatly appreciated as I hope to expand on this project when I persue my masters in conservation biology.\n\nThanks everyone.",
