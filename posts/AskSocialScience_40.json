I don't feel that highly educated, highly qualified STEM workers in the US have any issues competing with foreign workers, but those who fall short of expected qualifications might have issues.\n\nI also can't understand why some rationalize outsourcing STEM jobs as exploitative. These jobs are usually the safest jobs in the market. Compared to the other choices in jobs some of these foreign workers have, STEM opportunities in the US are the best chance they have at improving their quality of life, even the ones who don't get H1-Bs and work in the overseas offices. \n\nIf you see the global job market as a supply and demand system, why would it make sense to restrict companies' ability to hire foreign workers? Doesn't the increase of outsourcing in the US simply signify that the education system is failing to produce enough quality workers to meet with employer demands?",

Regarding things like climate change, vaccinations, Brexit, etc.\n\nWhen I read today one person said regarding the Oroville spillway situation that he questioned whether there still was a need for drought restrictions on water use when that dam was almost overflowing, it reminded me of some articles I read by Luhmann a few years ago.\n\nIIRC, Luhmann says that a part of society becoming more advanced is increasing differentiation, where more people become experts in their field in order to function because the field becomes more complex. This means that people in different fields start to have trouble communicating because they can't fully understand each other.\n\nHas there been any new writings on this recently? If the recent trends are a consequence of what Luhmann described, shouldn't we be able to see less of it in societies with a higher degree of educated people?

        "text": "I just read this review for Christopher Clarke's [*The Sleepwalkers*](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jul/19/sleepwalkers-christopher-clark-review), an analysis of the factors that led to the first world war, and the review mentions that Clarke briefly \n\n&gt;suggests that the European elites who vied to prove their virility in battle were suffering from a \"crisis of masculinity\". Could it really be that the war began because upper-class statesmen and generals felt threatened by the rise of previously marginalised \"proletarian and non-white\" men?\n\nThis made me think about a theme of 21st Century masculinity-in-crisis that I've seen discussed a lot in youtube comment sections (and in certain subreddits), [by one of my favorite rock and roll singers](http://www.craveonline.com/music/155340-josh-homme-and-the-blood-of-virgins) and [in this book that I once browsed through when I found it in the back of an airplane seat](http://time.com/4339209/masculinity-crisis/)\n\nIs there a masculinity crisis today? I'm a man and I don't really feel any crisis but if there are a lot of people talking about it maybe there's a little bit of *there* there. \n\nWas there a masculinity crisis leading up to the first World War? Was it a contributing factor in any way, however minor? [Another review of this book seems to think it's bs.](https://www.lrb.co.uk/v35/n23/thomas-laqueur/some-damn-foolish-thing) and even suggests that every war has a crisis-of-masculinity component.\n\n&gt;The only part of Clark’s analysis of the force fields of European political culture on the eve of the final crisis I find unconvincing is his discussion of what he calls a ‘crisis of masculinity’: ‘a preference for unyielding forcefulness over the suppleness, tactical flexibility and wiliness exemplified by an earlier generation of statesmen … was likely to accentuate the potential for conflict.’ It’s hard to say whether Bismarck was more secure in his masculinity than von Moltke but problems with masculinity have been at the heart of war since Troy. I doubt they were any more critical in July 1914 than at any other time.\n\nAnyway, I'm a little drunk right now, I'm not getting laid tonight, I'm reading this [cool profile on Angela Merkel](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/12/01/quiet-german) because I've become interested in her in these months following Trump's election which is where I first learned about *The Sleepwalkers* and I'm indulging my teenage paranoia regarding WWIII, which is helpfully summarized in this [Minutemen track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyjPiGpzPls)\n\nI'm not suggesting there's some kind of 1:1 parallel between the \"crisis of masculinity\" of the early 1900's as discussed by Clark and the \"crisis of masculinity\" of the early 21st century that weird dudes at the bar always seem to want to talk to me about a few beers in but I would really be interested in learning a little bit more about the subject and also hearing this subreddit's thoughts on the matter.\n\nThanks for reading!",

        "text": "At the beginning of the Republican primaries I was a very active member of various Donald Trump subreddits. The overall tone was very comedic and satirical, however over time these satirical subs became bases of very legitimate support. At first it was difficult to ascertain as to who was still being satirical or not since the language was still quite similar but over the last year it's become clear that internet support for Trump is more serious than ironic now. I found this change to be fascinating as the very real support Trump on the internet, still uses the specific catch-phrases that were popularized when supporting him was considered ironic. Are any of you aware of any similar phenomenons occurring elsewhere? Either political or not? And are there any theories for why and how this change in tone occurred? I'm sorry, this is not meant to be political. I thought this was a very interesting phenomenon and just wanted some input on it.",

This creates difficulties in maintaining the social fabric in a society.\n\n- Therefore, a free market with limited government intervention will allow the market to make conformity unnecessary, which means the lower the number of political decisions necessary, the less conflict as people are made to conform to an agreement. \n\nI want to know what kind of arguing style he uses throughout his book and how the argument above could be true or not. \n\nThanks for your help!",

I'm usually very interested in it, it's just, I get a few words in and find myself switching to a weaker form of media or distraction.\n\nI'm starting to hate myself over this, really. It's gotten to the point where reading 10 pages of a book or a paper on my kindle is no longer 20 minutes, but an hour and a half because of my lack of concentration. I heavily dislike the feeling of being scatterbrained, I was never like this. I used to do everything linearly, usually heavily engrossed in whatever topic at hand.\n\nDo you think the internet could have caused this? It did start when I started being on the internet in my free time more. What should I do to stop this? At this moment, I have around 30 tabs of reading and video material: from philosophy (heidegger's interpretation of nietzsche's will to power, and a phil of technology for instance), to netsec (various programming and career advice), history, etc. I probably get through 1 tab a day, spending most of my time reading small stuff and distracting myself, while adding 10 more tabs of \"interests for later.\" It's embarrassing.",
