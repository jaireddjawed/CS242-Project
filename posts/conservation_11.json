        "text": "Basically as the title asks. I'm wondering how widespread critical thought regarding a regulated wild game (mostly venison and boar and maybe goose) market in the US is.\n\nWhile the North American Model was definitely great for restoring game populations after unregulated market hunting drove them near extinction, many parts of the US contend with issues such as Lyme, vehicle collisions, impaired forest regeneration/invasive species, agri/horti/silvicultural damages, and the looming specter of stopping the spread of CWD due to an aging and shrinking population of recreational hunters. The introduction of various exotic game species like boar or intentional spread of geese breeding ranges further south also have led to various damages and public health and safety issues. I'm increasingly of the opinion that our conservation model needs revising in order to meet our changing needs.\n\nIs there any mainstream call within the scientific community for a regulated market in such species, or is it restricted to the fringes? If it's a fringe opinion, does it seem to be gaining traction?",

        "text": "&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Mountain Chicken](https://i.redd.it/imnly1062ui11.jpg)\n\nThe mountain chicken (*Leptodactylus fallax)* has been decimated by the deadly fungus chytrid!  This fungus has been responsible for over 200 extinctions in the last 10 years alone and is known to pose an immediate threat to over 30% of all amphibians worldwide.\n\nDurrell Wildlife Conservation Trust have recently launched a new project to develop and trial an in-situ technique to counter this deadly disease  and reinstate the mountain chicken in it's natural habitat on the island of Montserrat.  If successful this method could be applied on a global level to halt the extinction epidemic caused by chytrid.\n\nIn order to achieve this we have recently launched an experiment crowdfunding campaign, which is also part of a WDA Grant competition.\n\nPlease follow the link [www.experiment.com/mountainchicken](https://www.experiment.com/mountainchicken) in order to learn more about our project and how your support and donations could help us save thousands of species at risk of extinction.\n\nPlease feel free to share as much as possible.\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/9ahvx7/video/6caps2yrehi11/player",
