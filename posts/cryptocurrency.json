Any new coin should be considered a shitcoin until proven otherwise.\n\nMoons are a very different kind of coin. It's a social media token, meant for participation and content reward. It's not primarily meant to buy a cup of coffee, nor have any of the usual DeFi functions.\n\nIt's also build exclusively for Reddit, and for this sub.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# What makes something a scam coin?\n\nSomething with the sole purpose of making money for a smaller group of people in a subversive manner, without providing any real solution or services, and at the expense of people investing in that coin, by misleading those investors.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# What are the typical properties found in scam coins?\n\nThese aren't what makes a coin a scam, but usually scams will have several of these symptoms and red flags:\n\n\\-Shady team.\n\n\\-Aggressive marketing.\n\n\\-Marketing focusing on big returns.\n\n\\-Complete centralization.\n\n\\-Governance too centralized.\n\n\\-Focus on returns instead of tech.\n\n\\-Doesn't provide a solution, nor not much utility.\n\n\\-The proof is in the pudding. The mechanism and tokenomics will reveal if something is a scam.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# 1- The team.\n\nThe team behind Moons have had more than 2 years of work (over 3 years if you count the pre-building). So we are getting a better idea of how they operate now.\n\nThe team of developers are the admins from Reddit, not the mods. Some of you may have interacted with them. But the mods here do assist them on the front end and in dealing with the users.\n\nIt's really Reddit that's behind Moons. They initiated the project. So Moons come from the very top of Reddit. You have a core developing team, backed by a major social media company, with a front end mod team, and also partnerships outside Reddit.\n\nWhat have we learned in the last couple years? While initially they didn't communicate as much as we'd have wanted to, that has improved a little. There is still an issue of slow response between the mod team and admin team.\n\nBut the admins have shown to provide good development of their token and smart contract, and have been able to find a lot of solutions in scalability and in making Moons work. They've created a secure and functional wallet. The distributions since mainnet have all gone fairly smoothly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# 2- The marketing.\n\nIf you look at the marketing of Moons, it's very much focused on \"community contribution\" and \"ownership of a piece of a community\". It's very much focus on the social media functions of Moons, and has little to no mention of anything related to money, investment, or painting moons as an investment.\n\n[https:\/\/np.reddit.com\/community-points\/](https:\/\/np.reddit.com\/community-points\/)\n\n# \n\n# 3- Centralization of the token.\n\nSince Moons are a social media token for a specific site, it's expected that it would be heavily centralized, if not completely.\n\nReddit created the token, and the admins have laid out the basic vision and core principles of Moons. But beyond those core principles, users are free to vote on any other changes they want about distributions, how moons work outside those core principles, and even vote on new features, and changes for the sub.\n\nSo they gave back a lot of the control back to the users and the sub.\n\nThe token itself runs on a decentralized network. It's an Ethereum token that runs on Arbitrum Nova. Once you get them, it's out of the hands of Reddit. However, the smart contract is still controlled by Reddit.\n\nSo you have some aspects that make it less centralized than expected, and Reddit willingly removing their centralized authority, but in the end it still remains centralized at its core, as you would expect for something designed for a private site.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# 4- Centralization of the governance.\n\nIs the governance also too centralized?  Are the people in charge in control of most of the governance? Is a small group in control of the governance?\n\nHere's how the distribution works:\n\n\\-50% go to users. Who receive governance.\n\n\\-10% go to mods. Who also receive governance. And a discretionary portion of that 10% go back to the community in the form of rewards, prizes, etc...\n\n\\-40% go to Reddit. Those Moons don't participate in governance. A portion of it is what gets burned for things like the membership. And a portion can sometimes be returned to the community, like when they reimburse users for distribution errors.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/4idw4ygb9ina1.png?width=778&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=def821371d5647ee9a1e3260bff78832453d78c8\n\nThe Reddit wallet doesn't participate in the governance. And a portion of the mod distribution goes back to the users.\n\nSo the majority of governance is in the hands of the users. And a little less than 10% is controlled by the mods.\n\nSo who actually holds the governance power? Here's a rough estimate based on latest numbers:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[\\*Numbers not exact, due to a lot of burned and lost moons to be estimated\\*](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/m8zti12d9ina1.png?width=866&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c205c5d7bb321635b8e2c2914bdb1c4dc065cfc2)\n\nI don't know that many coins where there's very little of the governance in the hands of the team, and over 90% going to users.\n\nHowever, there is a caveat in that seemingly strong decentralization. Mods have a veto power on what proposals can be presented.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# 5- Tech and solutions.\n\nWhat solutions do moons provide?\n\nThey solve several problems for social media, like finding a way to reward content creators without relying on ads, provide engagement, create more participation, and attract more users.\n\nAlong with giving their users more voice, and a piece of the community.\n\nIt has also functioned as a token for many features like tipping, be the reward token for contests and games, buying special membership, purchasing banners and AMA, be the currency for the sub's merchandise, etc...\n\nIt has also expanded outside of the sub, and functioned as a the currency for subs paying Moons in exchange for services, and a sort of OnlyFans version with Moons.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# 6- What is the mechanism of moons, and are there any signs of scam, rugpull, or bad tokenomics.\n\nMoons are an Ethereum ERC-20 token on Abritrum Nova. They are run by an Ethereum smart contract, and work like your usual ERC-20 token.\n\nThey work as a social media reward token on Reddit, distributed for free for community participation. So while they have the function of an Ethereum token, they aren't primarily for buying a cup of coffee. Although, if a merchant wanted to accept Moons and sell you a cup of coffee for Moons, they could.\n\nMoons are designed to be inflationary, and have no true supply cap. Moons will perpetually get re-introduced, but with smaller distributions.\n\nThis is because the focus is on utility. Admins want Moon distribution to continue in the future, to be able to function as intended, and not become too hard to earn.\n\n**This is the opposite of the typical mechanism of a scam.**\n\nThere's also no cost to earning Moons. While you could buy them on exchanges, it's fairly easy to earn a lot of Moons for free.\n\n**Typically, scams don't give things away for free.**\n\nMoons are a governance token, and its functions can be decided by the community. And the majority of the community controls the governance.\n\n**It's hard to control a scam, when the community has too much control.**\n\nCould someone rugpull Moons?\n\nEven if the mods got together to rug Moons through a proposal, they don't have sufficient voting power. Their only edge is they can veto proposals, but they can't force a proposal they put forward, that the community doesn't want.\n\nEven many whales colluding can't control the governance.\n\nBut some big whales could manipulate the price.\n\nIt's getting a little harder now that there's growing liquidity, and it's now been added on two major exchanges with more volume.\n\nOnly Reddit can really rug Moons. While the Moons you own are yours, and Reddit can't touch them, the utility depends on Reddit. If they decide to discontinue the use of Moons or RCP, then the main utility of Moons would be gone.\n\nYou can still use them elsewhere, and build something with them and create new utility. But the original utility will no longer be there.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# TL;DR:\n\nNo, they aren't a scam coin, and are missing too many key properties of a scam coin.\n\nIn fact, many of its feature are the very opposite of what scam and shitcoins normally do. But it's not immune to rugpulls.\n\nThe growing utility, and a focus on innovative social media solutions, is also moving them too far from the realm of traditional \"shitcoins\".\n\nIt's however a centralized coin at its core, as you would expect for a token meant to be used on a social media platform. But Reddit moves some of that centralization away from itself, and allow for users and communities to have a voice on their RCPs.

Much has changed in the last 5 years, including the introduction of index products designed to capture the entire crypto market instead of manually buying coins and tokens ([like I do for my Experiments](https:\/\/toptencryptoindexfund.com\/announcing-top-10-2023)).\n\nThis year\u2019s friendly competition will be between The 2023 Top Ten Portfolio and\u00a0[The Alongside Crypto Market Index Token](https:\/\/alongside.xyz\/)\u00a0(**AMKT**).\u00a0\u00a0**AMKT**\u00a0is an ERC-20 token that represents a cap weighted index of the Top 25 Cryptocurrencies (minus stablecoins) backed 1:1 by the underlying assets represented within the index.\u00a0 Since the Top 25 represent approximately 97% of the value within crypto,\u00a0**AMKT**\u00a0should be an excellent proxy for the entire cryptocurrency market \u2013 exactly what my Top Ten Portfolios have been trying to recreate from the start.\n\nHere\u2019s the question I\u2019ll be tracking this year:\u00a0***would I have been better off with $1,000 of AMKT instead of going through the effort of creating a homemade $1,000 Top Ten Index Fund?***\n\nOn 1 January 2023, $1000 was equal to 17.15 AMKT.\u00a0 Two months into the

Ten Crypto Portfolios \n\nSo, where do we stand if we combine six years of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments?\n\n* 2018 Top Ten Experiment: down -42% (total value $578)\n* [2019 Top Ten Experiment](https:\/\/toptencryptoindexfund.com\/tracking-2019-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-50): up +204% (total value $3,036)\n* 2020 Top Ten Experiment: up +358% (total value $4,578) (***best

Experiment](https:\/\/toptencryptoindexfund.com\/tracking-2023-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-1): up +34% (total value $1,342)\n\nTaking the six portfolios together, here\u2019s the bottom bottom

summary:\u00a0***That\u2019s a +94% gain by investing $1k on whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st (including stablecoins) for six straight years***.\n\n## Comparison to S&P 500\n\nI\u2019m also tracking the S&P 500 as part of my Experiment to have a comparison point to traditional markets:\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/2xwz86rofina1.png?width=538&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f2a091ef3c01a508d872d5735dca1824ebf09011\n\nThe S&P 500 is up +3% so far in 2023, so the initial $1k investment into crypto on New Year\u2019s Day would be worth $1,030 had it been redirected to the S&P.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nTaking the same invest-$1,000-on-January-1st-of-each-year approach with the S&P 500 that I\u2019ve been documenting through the Top Ten Crypto Experiments, the yields are the following:\n\n* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $1,480 today\n* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $1,580 today\n* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,220 today\n* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,050 today\n* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2022 = $830 today\n* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2023 = $1,030 today\n\nTaken together, here\u2019s the bottom bottom bottom bottom bottom\u00a0*bottom*\u00a0line for a similar approach with the S&P:\u00a0\n\n**After six $1,000 investments into an S&P 500 index fund in January 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023 my portfolio would be worth $7,190.**\n\nThat is up\u00a0**+20%**\u00a0[since January 2018](https:\/\/toptencryptoindexfund.com\/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one\/)\u00a0compared to a\u00a0**+94%**\u00a0gain of the

Explained simply for beginners.","author":"flawlessfear1","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/11qg76r\/why_crypto_is_more_secure_than_banks_explained\/","text":"here it goes.\n\nCryptocurrency is often considered to be more secure than traditional banking systems due to several technical factors related to its design and architecture.\n\nFirstly, the decentralized nature of cryptocurrency means that there is no central authority controlling transactions or storing data. Transactions are verified by a network of nodes that reach consensus on the state of the ledger through a process known as \"mining\". This distributed architecture makes it very difficult for any single entity to manipulate the system, as they would need to compromise a large number of nodes simultaneously.\n\nSecondly, the cryptographic algorithms used by cryptocurrency systems are extremely complex and secure. These algorithms are designed to protect the integrity and confidentiality of data, making it very difficult for attackers to intercept or manipulate transactions. Cryptocurrency transactions are also verified through a process of digital signatures, which provide a high degree of assurance that the transaction has not been tampered with.\n\nAlso, the transparency of the cryptocurrency ledger makes it difficult for fraudulent activity to go undetected. Transactions are publicly visible and auditable, which makes it much harder for bad actors to cover their tracks. This also makes it easier for authorities to trace criminal activity and recover stolen funds. there are of course exceptions to this rule. Which are privacy coins. These cryptocurrencies are untraceable or near.\n\nFinally, the user-controlled nature of cryptocurrency wallets provides an additional layer of security. Users are able to store their funds in a digital wallet that is protected by encryption and other security measures, and are able to control access to their funds through private keys. This gives users greater control over their finances and reduces the risk of theft or fraud by third-party institutions.\n\nThis only skims the surface on why cryptos are safer than our current banking system according to blockchain specialists. there are also many arguments why banks can be safer than crypto. I can cover that topic too if you guys like this post. As always, do your own research and have a great day!","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678729385.0},{"title":"FBI Warns of Cryptocurrency Theft Via \"Play-to-Earn\" Gaming Apps","author":"crownpoly","url":"https:\/\/coinedition.com\/fbi-warns-of-cryptocurrency-theft-via-play-to-earn-gaming-apps\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.76,"created_utc":1678712484.0},{"title":"Warning!

Previously, Accessing COINBASE is overpriced because the address is initially cold under the access list framework introduced in EIP-2929.

Right now, it is achieved by different means, costing additional gas and deployment time.  \n\r\r  \nEIP-3860: Limit and meter initcode. Will limit the max size of initcode to 49152.

Cardano has always been slow. This is a noticeable improvement.\n2. Not every contract has switched to Plutus v2, and non-contract transactions do not benefit from reference scripts.\n3. [Blocks](https:\/\/cexplorer.io\/block) are still being produced at an average of one per 20s, even with Diffusion Pipelining. That's because Block production is inconsistent with large gaps. This is partially because there are too few transactions on Cardano to need it.\n\n## Issues with using TPS as a measurement\n\nYou might point out that TPS is a misleading metric due to larger transactions completely skewing the average, and you'd be mostly right. But we can still do fair comparisons.\n\nIt's not just an issue with Cardano, but with most blockchains. If everything were single-transfer transactions:\n\n* Bitcoin's TPS would increase 4x from \\~3-4 TPS to 12 TPS (for a Segwit P2WPKH Tx with a change output)\n* Ethereum's would increase 5x from \\~12 TPS to 59 TPS\n\nSo we can still do equivalent comparisons. On Cardano:\n\n* **Single transfers** (1 input, 2 outputs): 0.250kb or **18 max TPS** (vs 59 TPS for Ethereum)\n* **Swaps** (\\~7 UTXOs across 2 separate transactions): 0.95 kBs or **5 TPS** (vs 9 TPS for Ethereum based on 120k gas)\n\nTo be fair, you can add additional Cardano native tokens to a transaction while barely decreasing TPS. But this is only useful for CEXs and DEXs that do large batch transactions. Normal users would not send different tokens in the same transaction.\n\nAnd at some point, Cardano will introduce sharding with its Hydra update.

It achieves this increased level of privacy through three specific features: Ring Signatures, Confidential Addresses, and Ring Confidential Transactions.\n\n**Pros:**\n\n* **Scalability.** There is no limit to Monero\u2019s blockchain. This scalability should prevent fees from skyrocketing as usage increases.\n* **Privacy.** This is Monero\u2019s main selling point. It offers users true anonymity by preventing others from seeing your balance. This is something that many other cryptocurrencies lack.\n* **ASIC-resistant.** The majority of many types of cryptocurrencies are mined by purpose-built units known as \u2018ASIC miners\u2019. This makes them more centralised as the supply is controlled by those who possess ASIC miners. To prevent this, Monero mining can only be completed via CPUs and GPUs.\n* **Fungibility.** For a currency to be fungible, it\u2019s value can\u2019t be influenced by its source or usage. As many cryptocurrencies can be blacklisted if, for example, they were stolen, they aren\u2019t fungible. However, as Monero is untraceable, it is also truly fungible.\n\n**Cons:**\n\n* **Lack of Adoption.** Monero isn\u2019t as widely adopted as other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, which limits its use\n* **Lack of wallets.** It\u2019s more difficult to developers to work on Monero than for other cryptocurrencies. Therefore, there aren\u2019t a lot of wallets that support Monero. \n* **Centralisation of miners.** In spite of the fact that Monero is ASIC resistant, it still hasn\u2019t solved the problem of disproportionate control of cryptocurrencies. Three pools control over 40% of the hash rate.\n* **Reputation.** The anonymity Monero offers has lead to its adoption by black markets and it is widely used on the dark web. This association may limit Monero\u2019s widespread adoption.\n\n**Wallets that support Monero:**\n\n* Cake Wallet \n* Feather\n* Monerujo\n\nSo if you're the kind of person that likes privacy, Monero is the coin for you!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/1junnciivina1.jpg?width=224&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=531944f78b577c5c3d53a35321651a51a9e9bb36","upvote_ratio":0.63,"created_utc":1678720280.0},{"title":"Coinbase lost $240M in Signature Bank closure","author":"liveaskings","url":"https:\/\/cryptoslate.com\/coinbase-lost-240m-in-signature-bank-closure\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.7,"created_utc":1678722911.0},{"title":"Update that I got from Gemini for their stable coin GUSD","author":"badfishbeefcake","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/11qeo5h\/update_that_i_got_from_gemini_for_their_stable\/","text":"Hi there,\n\nWe are writing to provide you with an update on Gemini\u2019s banking partners in light of recent turmoil in the U.S. banking industry.We are deeply saddened to learn of the news about Signature Bank, Silicon Valley Bank, and Silvergate Bank.

It was caused at least partially by the Fed and a still [SERIOUS]LY-broken banking system from 2008","author":"OneThatNoseOne","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/11qejs4\/for_those_wondering_svg_bank_and_silvergate\/","text":"SVB and Silvergate failed for the same reason. Firstly, customer deposits are backed by treasuries. Those treasuries would pay close to 0% interest before the Fed started raising rates in 2021. Today, after raising rates, treasuries now pay around 5%, meaning that pre-2022 treasuries are near worthless(bit of an exaggeration) because no one wants those low-interest treasuries when there are much better options today.\n\nFast forward to 2022. Things were very good for Silvergate. But then FTX failed, and Silvergate had to cover 8 Billion in withdrawals, which were backed by treasuries as I said. So they had to sell these treasuries to be able to obtain liquid funds for customers to withdraw, but sell them at MASSIVE losses. Eventually, the real market value of those losses made it clear that they just didn't have enough money to cover customers who keep withdrawing, and you fail. Silvergate survived immediate post-FTX but there was another bank run early this year after they missed their SEC filing date. Essentially the same happened with SVB, except they faced a run as risk appetite changed. This was probably as from loan losses as they typically give big loans to startups for something like an option to buy equity\/shares in the company cheaply at some future date. But in a weakening economy, many of those tech startups simply failed. As for deposit withdrawals, smart money doesn't keep cash to lose it to inflation.\n\nNow banks are very responsible for their failure as well. Banks have the option of holding treasuries or bank reserves to back deposits. But the vast majority of treasuries because you can buy, sell, borrow and lend them to make more profit. Treasuries also pay interest, and only bank reserves in excess of the required amount paid interest pre-2020 when banks reserve requirement dropped to 0%. But reserves are much less volatile in a changing market being almost perfectly stable.\n\nAnother option is to buy what are called interest rate swaps. This is an agreement for banks to pay a fixed interest rate and receive a variable rate based on essentially on current Fed rates. When interest rates are low, you tend to make a loss but when they are high like now, you make a profit on the agreement, because you fixed rates is usually somewhere in the middle of the lowest and high rates the Fed would set over time.\n\nBut SVB and Silvergate had all their eggs in one basket. When times were good pre-2022, it was good. But when it goes bad when rates are high everything falls. But it is sort of hard to blame them fully because rates were,on a historical basis, essentially close to zero for **15** **years** post-2008. And the only went lower since a mini-crash in 2018 and *lower still* in 2020. Then suddenly last year things changed massively as rates were increased with newer treasuries now having much better rates. And remember that the 10-year treasury is massively popular and even 20 to 30-year are offered as well so banks can be stuck with a low-interest illiquid investment for many many years after they bought it, even if they need cash now for deposit withdrawals.\n\nJust like 2008, if banks need cash now to cover deposits but no one trusts each other to sell or lend or wants to buy treasuries with low value and have to sell at massive losses, the whole system collapses. The system is broken and the Fed and traditional finance system act like everything is ok.\n\nIn a weird way, I can see how that makes sense to them than being cast out into a real free market without their constant Fed support and government backers, and where a mature version of crypto is looking like a much better option, that would uproot everything the banks have built for decades, and in the case of some banks, centuries.","upvote_ratio":0.69,"created_utc":1678725500.0},{"title":"Hackers steal around $200 million from crypto lender Euler Finance","author":"iwontsaysiimfine","url":"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/entertainment\/hackers-steal-around-200-million-145931095.html","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.68,"created_utc":1678721630.0},{"title":"Bitcoin just hit an ATH of transactions on the mempool, higher than LUNA and FTX.

What if he told you he will double your money, just gave them to him and tomorrow he will come back with double amount?\nOf course you not trust him, you would either thought they deal drugs or want to scam you. No one is stupid enough to believe in this (if you would believe in offer like that anyway just stop investing for your own good and enjoy being poor, cause you will lose all your money sooner or later anyway). Then why you believe even more unsustainable profits in crypto? Money aren't free and no one will give you crazy APY just like that. If you someone does, they are predator and your are a prey, somehow this offer will backfire at you.\n\nOnly people you should trust are those you know. Don't assume random person that DM you or some new project is worth your trust. In crypto it is not trustworty until proven otherwise, it is untrustworty until hard facts will prove otherwise. Scammers and hackers are everywhere, don't make their job easier.","upvote_ratio":0.67,"created_utc":1678700013.0},{"title":"Could Reddit Community Points be More Valuable than Reddit Itself in the Event of an IPO?","author":"milehigh89","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/11qcmeg\/could_reddit_community_points_be_more_valuable\/","text":"The recent pamping of the moons got me thinking about the potential value of Reddit Community Points.

Yubikeys are a type of security key manufactured by Yubico.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/5cha7r7uhjna1.png?width=320&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=587d8706ce60f1470ebffbf08ac4d8f0edfb38f3\n\nYubikeys use U2F (Universal 2nd Factor), an open standard for two-factor authentication based on public-key cryptography.\n\nWith your Yubikey, you must first register it into your account to authenticate later.\n\n1. First, you must authenticate using another method, like your email and password.\n2. When you plug in your Yubikey and signal that you want to register a security key, the server you want to authenticate with sends a challenge and an AppID to the Yubikey.\n3. When the Yubikey receives this information, you'll be prompted by the browser to tap the Yubikey to confirm the request.\n4. Your Yubikey will generate a nonce and hash it together with the AppID and the secret key to create a private and public key.\n5. The nonce and public key are sent back to the server to be stored so they can be used later when the user wants to authenticate.\n\n### Authenticating with your Yubikey\n\n1. The server remembers you had registered a Yubikey, so it generates a new challenge to send back along with the AppID and nonce created when you first registered your Yubikey.\n2. The browser prompts you to tap the Yubikey, and the Yubikey will use the information received in step 1 to re-create the same key pair created when you registered your Yubikey.\n3. If everything goes well, your Yubikey encrypts the challenge sent by the server with the private key and sends the challenge back.\n4. The server decrypts the challenge using the public key it already has, and if the challenge matches the one the server sent, it means the user authentication was successful.\n\nOne of the advantages of using a Yubikey is that they protect against phishing attacks. Registering a new key to a server sends an AppID that could be the website URL you're trying to authenticate. Therefore, the credentials you create in a server are linked directly to a single website.\n\nYubikeys provide one-touch login without requiring a mobile phone to complete an authentication challenge.\n\n*Example, let's set up a YubiKey to work with Facebook. Note that for Facebook, the YubiKey can only log you in if you're using the latest version of Chrome or Opera. The hardware keys will work with Mozilla Firefox and Microsoft Edge on some services, but other services are more fickle\u2014check the browser requirements for each of your most commonly used web services. For the ones that don't support your hardware key, you can use a 2FA code-generator app instead.*\n\n*On the* *YubiKey setup page**, click on Facebook. Yubico will send you to a Facebook page called \"**What is a security key and how does it work?**\". To set up your YubiKey, Facebook directs you to* *Security and Login Settings**. Since a YubiKey is one of the factors in a two-factor authentication process, if you don\u2019t have 2FA set up yet, Facebook will guide you through setting that up first. This usually involves providing Facebook with a phone number to text you a one-time passcode. Once that\u2019s set up, go back to the* *Security and Login Settings page* *and look underneath where it says \"Setting up extra security.\" Next to the menu item \"Use two-factor authentication,\" click Edit. Under \"Security Keys,\" you\u2019ll find the option called \"Add Key.\"*\n\n*Now the moment of truth: the actual inserting of the key. Place your YubiKey into your USB port. Once plugged in, the key should show you a blinking light. If it\u2019s not blinking, try plugging it into a different USB port, or flip it around\u2014you may have inserted it upside-down. Once you see the blinking light, press the gold disk in the middle of the key. (If your model has a button, press the button instead.) With that, your hardware two-factor authentication key is activated. The next time you try to log in to Facebook, instead of using a six-digit passcode to verify your identity, you\u2019ll be asked to insert your YubiKey and give it a touch.*\n\n*If you ever forget your YubiKey at home, don't stress it. Facebook (or whatever service) will merely ask you to use another form of 2FA to log in, so you can go back to using your code-generating app as a fallback. If you ever lose your YubiKey entirely, you can go into your service's settings and remove your old YubiKey from your list of security keys.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/09kag5f8kjna1.png?width=299&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8b1ea57de350ba7ae97759a28cc4a30ede8affa0","upvote_ratio":0.67,"created_utc":1678728554.0},{"title":"Crypto currency exchange - Legit or Scam?","author":"HellsPerfectSpawn","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/11qftqb\/crypto_currency_exchange_legit_or_scam\/","text":"Greetings. \n\nI'm a greenhorn trying to get information on a crypto exchange introduced to be me by a friend.

Now if it had been normal rules\/operations Circle would only roughly get back $250,000 of this since that is where the standard insurance stops and according to Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), most of their deposits were not insured past this point. For once though the Government and Fed seem to be thinking about what is best for everyone and have made it to where the money in the accounts will be accessible. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis has resulted in USDC being able to almost completely regain in peg since the money will be there for Circle. That is not to say that Circle is in the clear as they will have access to this money but I am not sure where exactly they will be putting it. One of the Four Big Banks like JP Morgan could make huge inroads in the industry if they work with Circle and take on this cash. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFrom the  2007-2008 banking crisis, Bitcoin emerged and has since changed all of our lives on this sub in one way or another. Since all the major banks that have interacted with crypto have now gone down it leads me to wonder what the industry will come up with to address this issue. At the end of the day, onboarding and offboarding funds are going to be critical things to figure out and while banks would have been an easy solution to this we are now seeing that that could be an issue moving forward. Central exchanges have also come under increased heat recently with Kracken receiving a fine a couple of weeks ago and now KuCoin under fire by the State of New York.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCrisis in the world and the industry has led to innovation and I am optimistic about the future and see what type of solution is created going forward!","upvote_ratio":0.71,"created_utc":1678717099.0},{"title":"At this point, I'm in crypto for the entertainment rather than profits","author":"OneThatNoseOne","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/11pjv0e\/at_this_point_im_in_crypto_for_the_entertainment\/","text":"Don't get me wrong.

Do you believe that it is going to be a big player sometime down the line?  If anyone can shed a little more info on this project in simple terms it would be appreciated.

In 2016, the original Ethereum blockchain split into two separate blockchains following a contentious hard fork. The majority of Ethereum users moved to the new blockchain (ETH), while a minority chose to remain on the original blockchain (ETC).\n\nDespite the split, both Ethereum and Ethereum Classic use similar terminology and have similar features, which can lead to confusion for users who are not familiar with the differences between the two platforms.

However, all of this will be happening on the Polygon network so expect some people to be buying MATIC to swap to WETH via MetaMask. What does this mean? For a short while MATIC will be overvalued as it\u2019s hard to say how much of the Polygon coin will be spent on the actual prices of the avatars or gas fees. To add further confusion some of the prices of the avatars will also be fully priced as MATIC along with the gas fees (this is mainly true for lower prices). \n\nAnother caveat to watch out for; There will be a free giveaway of Reddit collectibles known as a Starter Pack. This should provide a mini bump in profits and usage of MATIC whilst Generation 3 should generate  a surge for the value of both MATIC and ETH with the value of these cryptocurrencies being valued at a much higher price. \n\nIf you are already DCAing MATIC and ETH then congrats on not being a complete degenerate\/ day trader).

A lot of people will lose a lot of money, and it is usually the little guy who does either directly or indirectly. But is certainly is ironic that everyone is once again(like 2008) caught with their pants down with traditional finance(TradFi) and the banking system. Experts expected other banks to fall from this, even if it's only non-mainstream small\/micro-banks, but all of them will feel a pinch, meaning the whole economy will surely feel it as after-effects. We know  the giant Credit Suisse is already in a pretty bad state, so it won't be at all surprising if they fall. And if *they* do, well all hands on deck. And imagine Fed chair Powell is(was?) set on hiking rates. That sounds like a sure-fire way to crash the economy.\n\nPeople like to act like crypto was created out of nothing as a scam, when in actuality. Many don't know that crypto(really Bitcoin) was created in 2009\/2009 directly directly *as a response* to the 2008 crash. People act like there isn't problems in the banking system that seriously need addressing, some of them being problems that crypto solves, although crypto does have some problems of its own. But these problems are mostly tied to it simply being very early and can be mostly remedied with time as it matures like more secure smart contract code and low adoption leading to volatility and difficulty of use. But many problems in the already mature TradFi banking system are fundamental and there by design. TradFi is a system where the rich are rewarded for being rich, and the richer they are the more they are rewarded. It's also a system that, as pointed out even in the White House \"*Crypto Report\"* last year, is terrible for sending cross-border payments, like many low-income overseas workers do for remittance for family back home, and millions working in essential but non-traditional are left out of the system among other things. Even non-rich traditional workers are afforded much worse services\/rates compared to the rich. We never said crypto was perfect, but they acted like the banking system and TradFi was, especially when referencing cryptocurrency. And this is where we are now, apparently back to 2008. All because some people tried to improve the financial system and move past it, while many others clung on to what was (probably) always a a sinking ship.","upvote_ratio":0.74,"created_utc":1678618874.0},{"title":"I admit Magneto mask did it.

Here goes my contribution.\n\n**How does Ethereum allow smart contracts?**\n\nEthereum was specifically designed to allow for the creation and execution of smart contracts, while Bitcoin was primarily designed as a decentralized digital currency. The key difference between Ethereum and Bitcoin is that Ethereum has a built-in programming language called *Solidity* that allows developers to write and deploy smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nSmart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code. Smart contracts can be used to automate and enforce the negotiation or performance of a contract, reducing the need for intermediaries and increasing efficiency and security.\n\nWhile Bitcoin also has some limited scripting capabilities, they are not as powerful or flexible as the smart contracts that can be created on Ethereum. This is because Bitcoin was designed to be a more lightweight protocol, focusing primarily on ensuring the security and integrity of transactions.\n\n**A smart contract example**\n\n    pragma solidity ^0.8.0;\n    \n    contract SimpleStorage {\n        uint storedData;\n    \n        function set(uint x) public {\n            storedData = x;\n        }\n    \n        function get() public view returns (uint) {\n            return storedData;\n        }\n    }\n\nThis smart contract is a basic implementation of a storage contract. It contains two functions, set()  \n and get(), which allow users to set and retrieve a single unsigned integer value, respectively.\n\nThe set() function takes an input parameter x and sets the value of storedData to that value. The function is declared as public, which means that it can be called by anyone who has access to the contract.\n\nThe get() function is a public view function, which means that it can be called by anyone who has access to the contract, but it cannot modify any state variables in the contract. The function simply returns the value of storedData.\n\nThis is a very simple example, but it demonstrates the basic structure of an Ethereum smart contract and how it can be used to store and retrieve data on the Ethereum blockchain. Smart contracts can be used for many other purposes, such as creating decentralized applications, managing digital assets, and executing complex financial transactions.\n\n**Example of using the set() function**\n\nLet's say you have deployed the SimpleStorage contract to the Ethereum network, and you want to set the value of storedData to 69 using the set() function. Here is an example of how you could do that:\n\n1. Open your web3-enabled browser and navigate to the Ethereum network where the smart contract is deployed.\n2. Get the contract address of the SimpleStorage contract.\n3. Use the contract address to load the smart contract interface in your wallet or browser. For example, if you are using the Metamask wallet, you can click on the \"Add Token\" button and then select \"Custom Token\".\n4. In the \"Add Token\" form, enter the contract address of the SimpleStorage contract, and then fill in the token symbol as \"SSC\" and decimals as \"0\".\n5. Click \"Next\" and then \"Add Tokens\" to load the SimpleStorage contract interface in your wallet.\n6. Now, you can call the set() function to set the value of storedData to 69. To do this, you will need to select the SimpleStorage token in your wallet, and then click on the \"Interact with Contract\" button.\n7. In the \"Interact with Contract\" form, select the set() function, enter the value 69 in the input field, and then click \"Write\".\n8. In the next form, review the gas fee for calling the set() function, and then click \"Confirm\" to execute the transaction.\n9. After the transaction is confirmed, you can verify that the value of storedData has been set to 69 by calling the get() function. The result should be 69.\n\n**Using a block explorer to confirm the function call**\n\nYou can see the value 69 using a block explorer. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. Open a block explorer such as Etherscan or Etherchain.\n2. Search for the contract address of your SimpleStorage contract.\n3. On the contract page, you should see a list of all the transactions that have interacted with the contract.\n4. Look for the transaction that corresponds to the call to the set() function where you set the value of storedData to 69.\n5. Click on the transaction to view its details.\n6. On the transaction details page, you should see a section called \"Input Data\". This section will show you the input data for the transaction, which includes the function selector and the input parameters.\n7. In the \"Input Data\" section, look for the input parameter that corresponds to the value of storedData that you set. In this case, the input parameter should be \"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000045\", which is the hexadecimal representation of the number 69.\n\n**Concluding remarks**\n\nOnce a smart contract is deployed to the Ethereum blockchain, its code is immutable and cannot be changed. This means that no one, not even the person who deployed the contract, can alter the code or its behavior.\n\nHowever, the data stored in the contract, such as the value of storedData in the SimpleStorage contract example, can be updated through the execution of functions defined in the contract. These functions can only be executed by users who have the necessary permissions and meet the conditions specified in the contract code.\n\nThis, friends, is the power of smart contracts.","upvote_ratio":0.71,"created_utc":1678658535.0},{"title":"Coinbase CEO ponders banking features after Silicon Valley Bank crisis","author":"throwaway662887788","url":"https:\/\/cointelegraph.com\/news\/coinbase-ceo-ponders-banking-features-after-silicon-valley-bank-crisis?utm_source=thecryptoapp","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.67,"created_utc":1678700934.0},{"title":"Are You Using Brave Browser Yet?","author":"bigstew6","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/11pxa1j\/are_you_using_brave_browser_yet\/","text":"I am a Brave user and have been for about 4 months now.

One of the world's first successful alt-coins, since it is based on Bitcoin's source code, both cryptocurrencies work similarly in terms of their mechanisms, including the proof-of-work consensus mechanism and the halving cycle. Therefore, just like Bitcoin, Litecoin's mining rewards are halved every four years, with the current halving happening this year **on or around Aug. 3, 2023** \n\nLitecoin uses an open-source blockchain that isn't controlled by any central authority.\n\n**Litecoin is four times faster than Bitcoin**\n\n* It has been shown that this crypto network processes transactions four times faster than Bitcoin. Litecoin's block generation time is estimated at 2.5 minutes, while Bitcoin's is 10 minutes. That's a big difference. \n\nApart from the encryption algorithms, this tweak may be the most significant technical difference between Bitcoin and Litecoin. This makes Litecoin a perfect cryptocurrency for small and quick transactions.\n\nWith an 84 million circulating supply, Litecoin has four times as many as Bitcoin. This means it is more convenient and accessible for users to earn more profits through mining, as well due in part by the decrease in Bitcoin mining rewards and overtime it'll make Litecoin a better option.\n\n\\-*LTC is accepted by merchants including BitPay, Travala, and others. In January 2023, 3,070 merchants accepted Litecoin as payment. This is a significant number. This rapid adoption makes Litecoin one of the leading cryptocurrency investments with real-world applications.*\n\n*In January 2023, the Litecoin Foundation claimed that Visa would enable holders to spend LTC via the Litecoin Card.*\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ggb3l1hgjdna1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2e45ff41680d54b4bfabc72c7314e88fe81673fd","upvote_ratio":0.62,"created_utc":1678655632.0},{"title":"Discussion between 2 Privacy projects, Aztec (ZK proofs) & Oasis (TEEs).

Here is a summary of how it happens and what I was able to find.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere are a few types of stable coins: Fiat backed, algorithmically stablalized, and smart contracts.\n\nThe main reasons behind depegging are :  market conditions, liquidity issues and regulatory changes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/i9sfctajbdna1.png?width=730&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e0ccd4ae348dc62977a661e09bed1e5c805ccb54\n\nHow do these scenarios play out?\n\n**Market Conditions-** The conditions that can cause a depeg are: sharp increase or decrease in demand of the stable coin. Also inflation and interest rates can play a role in depegging. If a large holder moves a large amount at once it can affect the peg.\n\n**Liquidity-** If a Fiat backed coin where its stored 1 to 1 with a currency ends up losing currency or access to it, the stable coin can depeg due not truly being backed at 1 to 1 ratio. In our current scenario this is due to a bank collapse.  MakerDAO was also affected by this through contagion.  \n\n**Regulatory Changes-** Such as a government ban on the stable coin. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Some history-** LUNA which we are all very aware of was attached to UST which was algorithmically stablalized. Luna was depegged when \" over $2 billion worth of UST was unstaked (taken off the Anchor Protocol), and hundreds of millions of it were quickly liquidated \" This caused UST to drop to $.90 so everyone was able to trade a $.90 asset for a $1.00 asset thus breaking luna.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/1r0q1bvpbdna1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a478f5e79b018aa04b5a1b35e85eb5b57ed0306a\n\n**Summary-** One would think fiat backed stable would be stable. But if you can secure the fiat it is just as vulnerable as the other two options. You would think they would make sure to bank with the larger most established banks, but as we have all seen dumb decisions can be made every day. Even large banks F up. It seems just pare for the course, anything can happen in crypto zero to a hundred and back to zero.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSources\n\n1. Coin telegraph\n2. Investopedia\n3.

Added some extra ideas this time in the hope that it gains a bit more traction which in turn would hopefully lead to more examples\/ideas of how to implement this tech.*\n\nWanted to provide a number of examples that show what **ZK-proofs** (zero-knowledge proofs) and especially **TEEs** (trusted execution environments) can mean for the crypto space. I feel like examples are important and left out too much when talking about new tech. Some examples may be similar, would be nice if people could come up with more examples in the comments.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. **Undercollateralized or variable rate lending.** Borrower reputation can be established via private data such as credit history. Those with a good reputation can get loans using less collateral and\/or loans with lower interest rates.\n2. **MEV-resistant DEXs.** Important aspects of orders such as slippage parameters can be kept private from even the nodes themselves, preventing them from manipulating orders and\/or frontrunning. This allows users to keep more of the value of their trades.\n3. **Privacy-preserving decentralized identity.** Also called anonymous credentials. This could allow people to, for example, satisfy KYC\/AML laws without revealing their entire identity to everyone. This can also allow dApps to screen users based on e.g. age or country.\n4. **Confidential NFTs.** The owner of an NFT gains access to private data such as an image. This could be used to enhance the value of owning an NFT since not every aspect of the token is available publicly.\n5. **Confidential voting.** This could be especially useful for DAOs. It allows for votes to be held in which voters are not influenced by the votes that were submitted before them.\n6. **Collaborative analytics.** For example, multiple companies or individuals could pool their data and perform a privacy-preserving analysis whose results are only shared within a certain audience. Since data is only analyzed within a TEE, there is less chance for a data leak.\n7. **Games with hidden on-chain state.** Example: puzzle games in which there is an answer that must be kept from the player. Another example: Games in which players act on information that cannot be revealed to other players.\n8. **Games that rely on random number generation.** Through the use of TEEs to generate random numbers without an external oracle. Gambling games could make use of this (rolling a die). RPGs could incorporate this as well.\n9. **An info leak marketplace.** Leakers can upload private information. The leaker can choose to sell it to one, several, or many people. They can also set a fundraising threshold past which they will reveal the secret to everyone. Leaker's reputation can be based on ratings.\n10. **Proof-of-humanity.** A privacy-preserving user verification system can be implemented that proves a user is human based on uploaded ID documents or attestations from trusted institutions\/companies. This could be useful on any dApp that wants to exclude bots.\n11. **More fair auctions.** VCG, second price, and candle auctions are examples of more fair auction methods that require privacy.\n12. **Prediction markets for crowdsourced data.** Imagine sending out a survey to people asking a list of questions. After everyone submits the survey, they can bet on the results of this survey. E.g. \"What is the most popular response to X? How do you predict X to relate to Y?\"\n13. **Biomedical data marketplace.** Biometric data from wearing a smartwatch, demographic data, genomic data, blood work data, etc. all could be uploaded and protected so that only owners of the data can control who accesses it. Data analysts could pay data owners for access.\n14. **Family Tree DAO.** A type of Data DAO that stores family information like genome sequences, photos\/videos and medical records. Data can be kept private within the family and passed down through the generations.\n15. **Initial Data Offering (IDO)**. Any endeavor with the potential to yield valuable data could sell rights to future data revenue in order to raise funds. Studies, polls, surveys, Data DAOs, new data-generating products or applications, etc. could all raise money this way.\n16. **Data science competitions for private data.** This would be a decentralized version of Kaggle, which allows people to offer datasets that competitors can analyze in order to win reward money. For private data, all analyses would be performed within a TEE, preserving privacy.\n\nHopefully, this has been helpful to some people in understanding why private smart contracts are the most important thing to get right in the next few years. **Important to note is that most of the ideas presented can only be implemented with TEEs.**","upvote_ratio":0.74,"created_utc":1678659137.0},{"title":"Those of you who sold during a huge dip, why did you do that?","author":"Annon-20","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/11prfex\/those_of_you_who_sold_during_a_huge_dip_why_did\/","text":"Hey friends.

The problem is that slowly we have become less and less self-sovereign since Satoshi's invention, and we are giving more and more power to third parties. Which is essentially what Satoshi's was trying to avoid.\n\nMost new cryptos, new websites, new defi platforms, are only created with one purpose: to make money. And more explicitly: to make money out of you.  You need to ask yourself, how many levels of \"trust me bro\" I need to go down to use this platform? For example, let's say you have some \"tokens\" in some defi platform: you need to trust the token creator not to rug pull, you need to trust the defi contracts not to have security holes and be hacked. You need to trust the platform not to have mev bots or liquidators that will fuck you up and take your money (see that example of the guy who lost $2 mill and got $0.05 on a dodgy swap). There are so many layers of \"trust me bro\"-ness that there's no way you can sleep well at night.\n\nHere's a short list of assets (doesn't contain all types), but it you want to be in crypto with the lowest degree of \"trust me bro\"-ness, you need bitcoin in a hardware wallet. It's been running over 10 years, it doesn't have smart contracts that can be hacked, it doesn't have dodgy web3 pages that will make you sign some scam contract and steal all your money.\n\nSome examples of assets, from less to more \"trust me bro\"-ness:\n\n1. **Physical gold**, stored at home in a safe. Yes, you have the \"trust me bro\" problem of not knowing exactly the amount of total gold being mined, etc. But gold has been used for thousands of years to store value. And you don't depend on a state currency that can be printed and printed.\n2. **Hard cash** from a low inflation western country (dollars, euro, swiss francs, etc.). The government of such country will tell you \"trust me bro\" I won't print too much money and make it less valuable\n3. Cash from 2 in a **bank**. The bank will tell you \"trust me bro\" your deposits are safe, the money it's covered by the government deposit guarantee. \n4. **Bitcoin**, stored in a hardware wallet. Now some could argue that this has even less \"trust me bro\"-ness and 2 and 3, given you don't depend on a central bank. But the technology has only been around for around 10 years. But the fact is that it keeps working: blocks keep being created and this can give you a good level of confidence. Also this is the original cryptocurrency, it has the first mover advantage, and it's way ahead of competition. \n5. **Ethereum**, in hardware wallet. Second crypto, it has a reason to exist (to add smart contracts to a cryptocurrency). I was an eth maximalist in the last few years. But the move to PoS means that all those original eth holders (ethereum foundation, ethdev, etc.) now will get a much larger percentage of staking fees than anyone else (the rich getting richer). Also it has the problem of the vast a mount of fucking dodgy smart contracts and shit tokens.\n6. **Other L1** coins (cardano, etc.). You need to ask yourself what's the reason for these to exist, do they add any great functionality that doesn't exist in bitcoin & ethereum?\n7. Ethereum **L2**. I trusted L2s in the past, operated a lot in arbitrum, matic, etc. I ran an arbitrum node for a while, but there was no way for me to get any of the fees which felt strange. So there's the \"trust me bro\" of the people of the L2, where you have deposited your eth via a bridge. A bridge than can be hacked. Will you be able to get your L2 back to L1 in a year? In 10 years? A lot of \"trust me bro\"s.\n8. **Stablecoins**. These are erc-20 tokens, defined by a contract, that can have a security hole, can be hacked. In the case of usdc, it has a backdoor and they can freeze your coins whenever they can. You also need the \"trust me bro\" promise that they keep 1$ of each released token. \n9. Other **erc-20 tokens**. Created of of thin air by the people who wrote the contract, you need to trust them not to print more, not to rug pull and sell their (large) holdings, etc.\n10. **Defi products**. Now here you are compounding the risk and \"trust me bro\"-ness of the stables and erc-20 shit, with the risks of the Defi smart contracts (that are constantly being hacked) plus the MEV bots that are scanning the mempool for transactions (like sharks waiting for victims) and will frontrun you and make you lose money. \n11. **Cefi** banks \/ websites. We give them total control of our crypto (100% trust me bro) but then even worse, they go and gamble it on several other layers of \"trust me bro\"-ness by using 10. This is probably the extreme level of \"trust me bro\"-ness.\n\nI get that we are geeks that like to play around  with new technologies, we get a feel of satisfaction when we get a new tool working (i.e. metamask), but we need to ask ourselves, how many layers of  \"trus me bro\"-ness are we adding to the original bitcoin whitepaper? If you like to geek out, install bitcoin core, run your node, practice sending transactions, etc. If you are still bored, install a lightning node in your bitcoin node, add some channels, start managing it, use a bitcoin wallet in your phone like walletofsatoshi, bluewallet, etc. Make lightning payments to friends and family. Explore nostr and zapping... There's a whole world out there of crypto where you are self-sovereign and you keep control of all of your assets, trusting no one.\n\nLet's go back to basics.","upvote_ratio":0.56,"created_utc":1678647438.0},{"title":"Binance Trains Ukraine\u2019s Cyberpolice and Security Service","author":"ankitskywalker","url":"https:\/\/news.bitcoin.com\/binance-trains-ukraines-cyberpolice-and-security-service\/","text":"Does anyone have more info on this?

Removing decentralization to make blockchain faster is just a really bad Database implementation.\n\nThe essential aspect of a cryptocurrency is its decentralised nature; all other features, like as high speed, low fees, and any other amazing technical innovations, are merely ways to improve it.\n\nI would love to hear the community's thoughts on this!\n\nThanks!","upvote_ratio":0.74,"created_utc":1678632905.0},{"title":"BlockFi warned over $227m stuck in Silicon Valley Bank","author":"witcherycro","url":"https:\/\/crypto.news\/blockfi-warned-over-227m-stuck-in-silicon-valley-bank\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.92,"created_utc":1678609007.0},{"title":"Top 10 Android cryptocurrency tracking apps","author":"Technical-Western897","url":"https:\/\/anim.cc\/media\/50d35b12","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.64,"created_utc":1678667443.0},{"title":"Crypto is still too hard to be convenient","author":"marekt14","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/11ov2vm\/crypto_is_still_too_hard_to_be_convenient\/","text":"I wanted to buy some MOONs today (yes, I am not making this up), and I have been primarily using CEXs for trading, but since MOONs are not listed anywhere, I needed to go through 'the regular' process.\n\nAnd Lord behold, it is actually a pain in the ass.

Introducing weighted DCA.","author":"PsieSyrenki","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/11pgo3g\/strategy_analysis_is_there_a_better_choice_than\/","text":" \n\n# Introduction\n\nEveryone knows that DCA and HOLD is the king of crypto investing. Everyone loves it for lack of unnecessary emotional involvement with your investment and simplicity.\n\nBut what if there is better way to become a whale of cryptocurrency world? What if there is secret sauce that lays in the open just before our eyes?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGoal of this analysis is to prove or disprove superiority of weighted DCA strategy over standard DCA.\n\n# Essentials\n\n*What is weighted DCA?*\n\nWeighted DCA (thats how i named it, maybe there will be better alternative in the comments) is strategy that is variant of standard DCA with one simple change. In addition to buying at the market price every week you also set limit orders at some % below market price.\n\nSo, how it works exactly? Example -20%\n\n1. You split your weekly DCA into 5 parts\n2. One part you buy at the market price and other four part are going into limit orders 5,10,15,20% below market price.\n3. After a week either your orders get fulfilled or not. Unfulfilled orders are canceled and added to next week DCA fund.\n4. Spilt into 5 parts again.\n\nExample on numbers:\n\nBitcoin at 31 December 2021 was traded at 100'000$ (totally random date and price )  and week later price dropped to 90k$. You DCA 100$ every week.\n\n1. Your orders 20$ at 100k, 20$ at 95k, 20$ at 90k, 20$ at 85k and 20$ at 80k.\n2. After a week you have to unfulfilled orders at 85k and 80k for sum total 40$, you cancel them and add to this week DCA.\n3. So now you have 140$ (100$ weekly plus 40$ from unfullfilled orders) - you split them again to 5 parts (28$) and place orders at market price and -5,10,15,20%.\n\nIsn't it timing the market? Maybe, but put down your pitchforks and wait for results before you lynch me.\n\n# Excel time!!!\n\n*Data*\n\nData i used for analysis come from [https:\/\/www.investing.com\/crypto\/bitcoin\/historical-data](https:\/\/www.investing.com\/crypto\/bitcoin\/historical-data).\n\nI calculated 3 different time periods (5 years, 2 years and 1 year) and 3 strategy variants (-20%, -15% and -10%). Data used starts from 4 March 2018 and ends at February 26 2023. Weekly DCA amount is 100$ in all variants presented.\n\nThat's how my excel is looking. I know ugly af, but it works.\n\n[Ugly af excel sheet ;\\(](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/e0e8nbjgabna1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ef02953690304b1d7bc3f4c7a1f8b8df96121d09)\n\n# Results\n\nSo it's time. The tension and grant finale. Let's present the results.\n\n[5 years Bitcoin accumulation graph](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/sa25u4rjbbna1.png?width=1072&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=6841d024e72fb78552a0ab44df289dd1409224ee)\n\nMost successful variant of strategy tested was -20%\/5 parts DCA with results of:\n\n* 4,23% gain compared to standard DCA at 5 year period\n* 5,25% gain compared to standard DCA at 2 year period\n* 4,86% gain compared to standard DCA at 1 year period\n\nSecond best was -15%\/4 parts DCA with results of:\n\n* 3,91% gain compared to standard DCA at 5 year period\n* 4,70% gain compared to standard DCA at 2 year period\n* 4,54% gain compared to standard DCA at 1 year period\n\nLast was -10%\/3 parts DCA with results Of:\n\n* 2,92% gain comapred to standard DCA at 5 year period\n* 3,53% gain comapred to standard DCA at 2 year period\n* 2,87% gain compared to standard DCA at 1 year period\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe results are pointing that this approach would make significant gains in the past, but we need to remember that  past results don't guarantee same results in the future. \n\nMy toughs:\n\nThere's no much difference between -15% and -20% approach and there was only 8 times when price dropped more than -20% in a week in 5 years, 1 time in last 2 years and 0 in last year . In my opinion there  -15% approach could be most profitable in the future, as crypto markets are becoming more and more mature and less volatile.\n\nIt would be nice to know  your thoughts about this and if u want me to make more post like that.\n\nTLDR: Looks like it is worth time spend, but without crystal ball who knows?","upvote_ratio":0.66,"created_utc":1678633548.0},{"title":"In how many crypto incidents you have been affected?

He is suspected of committing financial crimes on American soil and in countries in the Caribbean, Europe and Asia.  Since the beginning of this year, when investigations began, the PF discovered that Francisley also had victims in Brazil.

With his current risk score and assigned values, he estimates Bitcoin is currently worth $400,000 a coin as a hedge against fiat's global risk. \n\nThe value comes from BTC being a safety net in the event of fiat values collapsing. When viewed this way, there aren't as many alternatives I can think of that would offer the same potential as BTC to hedge against a global fiat erosion. All existing hedges are still part of the traditional system.\n\nThis is a more neutral way of viewing BTC and less of a hyper maxi view that it's competing with money. It's simply a possible backup if one ever becomes necessary. As a society, safety nets and urgent alternatives seem warranted in such a volatile macro economy.\n\n\n\nI can see this being a rationale value proposition. In terms of risk management, it offers something without counterparty risk.

This features floor prices and recent sales, with direct links to all the gen 1, 2, and wsb avatars. There are fake reddit avatars on OpenSea, so using the correct links will help to keep you safe (the genuine avatars will always have the OpenSea verified blue tick).\n\nThe site also has a portfolio feature, so by pasting your public wallet address you can see what your avatars are worth (free avatars aren't currently included, with the exception of wsb). This is perfectly safe. Your wallet address is already public and you don't need to connect your wallet to the site.\n\nAnother fun tool is the [reddit avatar explorer](https:\/\/www.redditavatarexporter.com) which allows you to view and download your current avatar on to other avatar backgrounds. So even though *The Hands* might be out of your budget, you can still take a look at what your avatar would look like on The Hands background and pretend you own it, while crying because you don't (that's what I do anyway).\n\n[Avatar market cap](https:\/\/avatarmcap.com\/) allows you to view the market cap of all the avatars, including the free ones, with links to OpenSea. It also has a portfolio tracker.\n\nAnd finally [redditavatars.io](https:\/\/www.redditavatars.io) is a great resource for showing stats of % unique owners, daily volume, and some helpful guides.\n\n[Snooavatars](https:\/\/snoovatars.com) send email notifications about when a particular avatar you may be interested in becomes listed on OpenSea. The creator also said there will be a notification sent when gen 3 is dropped in the shop, although this is a paid premium feature.\n\nThere are also helpful guides in the avatar trading sub.\n\n**Bonus tip:** You can make sure your bank card works with Reddit *before* gen 3 drops by purchasing a small amount of reddit coins. If the transaction is successful, you should be good to go (be aware that some banks may freeze your card if you make multiple transactions in quick succession). Some people also suggest using Google play credits, although I haven't tried this myself.\n\nPlease feel free to share any avatar resources or tips that I may have missed in the comments.\n\nAnyway\u2026when gen 3?","upvote_ratio":0.73,"created_utc":1678609382.0},{"title":"Don't Let Hackers Get Your Crypto: The Importance of Using Different Passwords and 2FA","author":"AnonAzy2","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/11pgspd\/dont_let_hackers_get_your_crypto_the_importance\/","text":"Many websites require you to create a username and password to access their services.

Circle then will need to not have the 90% of reserves it claims to, or fail to redeem smoothly. Even rumors, FUD from influencers, or poor communication can trigger bank runs in such situations. \n\nIt is hard to estimate just how leveraged DeFi (and leveraged trading itself and margins) is in the assumption of the pegs of USDC and DAI - this explains why it fell so hard even though Circle claims some 10% of its reserves are affected. People don't want to risk extreme scenarios on bank open Monday. CEX orderbooks are smaller than Circle reserves, but we don't know just how big the size of stablecoin holders that want peace of mind is (plus its not just USDC anymore), they may redeem.

Where as I argue savings shouldn't be in fiat. Even if you don't use crypto to hold your value. Holding it in fiat is a bad idea IMO because you lose buying power over time. Meaning you need whatever investment to pay 5% or more to keep up with the average buying power change. (more because taxes) Otherwise you're losing roughly 5% per year in just buying power just keeping it as fiat.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit 2:\n\nSorry for not wording it right. When I say worse investment. I meant based on what you know vs not knowing. It's 100% known with the current system fiat will lose buying power year over year. Which means when you leave your money long term as fiat you 100% know you will lose roughly 5% buying power each year.\n\nWhere with investments it's an unknown. Yes if an investment does worse than yes it is the worse investment. But these things you won't know for 100% because they are in the future. So right here right now, with the knowledge you know. Doing nothing you will always lose roughly 5% per year.

However, it\u2019s probably safe to say that most people here were around for, or are at least aware of, the FTX collapse. So everybody here should be well aware of the risk that they might lose anything they hold on an exchange without warning. If this is a significant amount of value\/investment for you, then you are taking massive risks in an industry already fraught with risk.\n\nI know there is a lot of what people would call \u201cFUD\u201d around exchanges like Binance and Coinbase, but even if none of it is true - and as we\u2019ve seen, sometimes it is - why take the risk? What benefit are you getting, during a bear market when most people are simply hodling and\/or dcaing? Is connecting your cold wallet once a month to move your new DCA to it really such a hardship? In a bull market when you might want to sell at any moment (a concept that seems alien to many of us with huge red dildos right now), I can see *some* benefit, but even then the time it takes to connect your wallet shouldn\u2019t have a huge impact on your decision to sell.\n\nUnless you are day trading and need to have constant access to your crypto, or your portfolio is worth less than the price of a Ledger or Trezor (for example, other wallets are available), there really are no downsides to having self-custody of your crypto. A cold wallet is anything but. It makes you feel warm and fuzzy inside, it takes care of you and your ~~gambling~~ *investment*, and it doesn\u2019t steal your funds when it goes bankrupt and run off to the Bahamas to have relations with a goat woman.\n\nThe recent scares around Silvergate and USDC have the potential, however slim, to cause great waves across the market, which could potentially see other exchanges struggle and go under. It may all be a storm in a teacup, who knows? But we\u2019ve had enough warnings now; if at this point you still take the risk and lose your crypto to a failed exchange, you have nobody else to blame.\n\nSo, TLDR: There are only so many times you can be warned before it\u2019s your own fault for not moving your crypto off an exchange and taking self-custody.

And from lack of better options, they had to look at more long term investments.\n\nAnd that's where it came back to bite them in the ass.\n\nFeds have increased interest rates way too fast, to try to tackle inflation....which was caused mainly by their money printers, along with the side effects of the Covid crisis.\n\n# \n\n# What happens when interest rates rise too fast?\n\nShort term, it means it increases the rates for everything  (loans, bond rates, mortgage rates, etc..}\n\nSo that's good news for banks right?\n\nNot for banks like SVB who don't have enough of the short term investments, and are more heavily invested in long term investments.\n\nThe rates may have increased short term, like for bons, but long term bonds are lower now. It's called an inverted yield curve. When long term bonds give you a lower yield than short term bonds, when normally it should be the opposite.\n\nBanks like SVB have 2 problems:\n\nThey have the shittier rates of return, and they are tied up in long term investments that they are stuck with for years before it reaches maturity. They can off course sell it at any time, but not for what they've put in. Those bonds have lower demand, so they have to sell them at a loss. So to have cash and provide liquidity, they have to lose money.\n\nAnd that's when they start seeing red.\n\nWhen people realize those banks may not have enough money, it could start a bank run.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Silvergate\n\nSilvergate ran into that very same problem. But on top of that, it also had too many people from crypto pulling out their cash from the crypto market.\n\nA big chunk of Silvergate are crypto depositor.\n\nIn 2022, there were more people pulling out cash than putting it in, due to the crypto bear market.\n\nAnd they pulled out by the hundreds of millions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# How does this affect crypto?\n\nSome of these banks like Silvergate, were heavily tied in crypto, and were banks used for DeFi. And as many of these things typically go, there could be more contagion. It starts affecting everything.\n\nMore importantly for us in crypto, its one of the depositors for exchanges like Coinbase and Gemini.\n\nWhen you bought crypto on Coinbase, one of the bank they used to deposit that money was Silvergate. Same when you cash out.\n\nBut JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Signature Bank, and others, are still among the banks they still use as their FBO accounts to get those funds and liquidity.\n\nThe other issue is the people panicking about USDC. Luckily, USDC is not an alog stablecoin like Luna.\n\nThe main issue realy lies ultimately on the banking side.\n\nAnd you can make the case that this actually further highlights the problems of banking, and the need for blockchain, decentralzation, and crypto.\n\nThe big flaws here are exposed in the centralized banking system.\n\nIt relies too heavily on trust.\n\nTrusting a bank, and trusting that not too many people will pull their cash at the same time.\n\nBecause the hard truth is in the end, banks don't actually have your money.\n\nIn crypto, your funds are always gonna be on the blockchain whenever you need them. It's absolute money, with absolute ownership, always absolutely present.\n\nBut right now, crypto still heavily tied to centralization and traditional market. The decentralized side of finance isn't big enough yet.\n\nIs this something big and long term for crypto?\n\nIt will likely have further short term side affects. But when it comes to the crypto market, I wouldn't bet on long term effect. Coinbase, Gemini, and many other users of these banks, already have alternative. Many of the funds were also FDIC insured FBOs. I know Coinbase's fund should be mostly FDIC insured.\n\nAnd even USDC which seems to be what's most affected, isn't an algo stablecoin like Luna, and has a better chance at getting repegged, along with more likely having a more solid backing.\n\nAnd ultimately, we got the advantage of already have seen this play out. We've had a combo of Luna collapsing, one of the main exchanges (FTX) also collapse in its own scam, and other financial companies in crypto like Voyager also tank.  And we've seen that despite the apocalyptic and Lehman brothers look alike, the effect remained short term, and crypto managed to bounce right back fairly quickly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# tl;dr: Explain to me like I'm 5.\n\n\\-Remember Covid and Fed printers? That caused a lot of inflation, the cost of goods rising.\n\n\\-Fed in response raised rates to tackle it, but maybe a little too high too quickly.\n\n\\-Those rates rising, plus the market expecting a recession, caused short term bonds to be worth more, but long term bonds to drop in value.\n\n\\-Banks like SVB who simply didn't have any better options at the time (mainly because of Covid), were too heavily invested in long term bonds.\n\n\\-Those banks portfolio lost value, and couldn't give competitive returns, customers pulled out.\n\n\\-As people pulled out, they had to sell those bonds to be able to pay money to those customers, but at a loss.\n\n\\-It created a vicious cycle, of lost value, and even more customers wanting to pull out. And eventually a bank run as the bank was failing.\n\n\\-One of those banks (Silvergate) was one of the money provider for Coinbase, Gemini, and others in crypto. That bank lost value because of the interest rates issues, and because of too many crypto bros pulling out their money during the bear market. It eventually failed. That created a ripple effect of fear on crypto (especially on USDC).\n\n\\-Some good news: USDC isn't an algo coin like Luna. We've already seen financial companies for crypto collapse last year, while seeing stablecoins completely collapse, along with major exchange collapse, in the same time frame. And crypto was still able to bounce back quickly. Coinbase, Gemini, etc... have already found other banks elsewhere. There could be some potential government bailouts.

Once you've found these surges, note down the specific dates on which they occurred.\n\nNext, go to [Etherscan](https:\/\/etherscan.io\/) and enter the target token address in the search bar to access its dashboard page. Click on the \"Dex Trades\" button to see all the buys and sells that have occurred for that asset on decentralized exchanges (DEXes).\n\nClick on the \"Action\" button and then \"View All\" to see the full list of historical DEX transactions. Hone in on the time period just before your target price surge happened to analyze the transactions.\n\nI can go on so please explore yourself.\n\n# 2) Context\n\nIf you are into NFT then stay up to date with NFT activities. [Context](https:\/\/context.app\/) is a platform that makes it easy to monitor NFT activities from your target crypto wallets. With its feed stream and navigation bar, you can always stay up-to-date with the latest NFT happenings from people you care about.\n\n# 3) Impersonator\n\nImpersonator is purely a visual tool for monitoring activities, as logging in to view an address doesn't permit any transactions since the system doesn't interact with private keys. Though it might sound disappointing it's fun to look around.\n\nWe can still enter a specific wallet address, such as rsa.eth or vitalik.eth, into [Impersonator](https:\/\/www.impersonator.xyz\/) to gain a firsthand view of their recent crypto activities.\n\nI know that the last couple of days was a roller coaster ride for most crypto communities and being a smallholder all I can say is we can't do anything in it so I will rather be calm than spread FUD or talk shit about my own investments.\n\nI'm new to crypto and have just been 1 year in this industry I jumped into this because I wanted to get rich quickly.

It's probably not what you think it is.","author":"neomatrix248","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/11owe3i\/what_actually_is_an_erc20_token_its_probably_not\/","text":"Almost everybody in this space has heard the term Token, and the majority have heard the term ERC-20 Token, but I would wager that few really understand what they are, and how they differ from the main asset in the Ethereum network, i.e. Ether.  \n\nJust to be clear, a token is an asset that is created on top of an existing blockchain network.  This is as opposed to what we would generically call a \"coin\", which is the actual asset whose rules for creation, transferring, and usage are governed by the code that runs the blockchain network itself.  On the Ethereum network, things like USDC, Shiba Inu (SHIB), or Polygon (MATIC) are tokens, and Ether is what is commonly referred to as the \"coin\".\n\nWhat do I mean when I say that tokens are created on top of the existing network?  That's where ERC-20 comes in.  ERC is an acronym meaning \"Ethereum Request for Comments\".  For those of you familiar with networking, the internet is full of protocols that are defined by documents called RFCs, or Request for Comments.  The name is not particularly good at helping understand what an ERC or RFC actually is.  To put it plainly, it's a document that defines a set of rules for some kind of protocol or interaction between nodes on a network, and these rules are debated upon by the community before they come to a consensus.  Hence the \"request for comments\" part.  ERC-20 is the document that lays out a set of agreed upon rules for what a Token on the Ethereum network should be, and how users of the network can use it.\n\nIf you want to read the actual standard (it's pretty short), you can do so here: https:\/\/ethereum.org\/en\/developers\/docs\/standards\/tokens\/erc-20\/\n\nOk, now here's the part you probably didn't know.  An ERC-20 token on Ethereum (the same goes for any other blockchain network I can think of that has tokens) is actually just a smart contract.  There is a single contract that is deployed that (hopefully) correctly implements the ERC-20 standard.  It's a very simple contract, and pretty much all it does is maintain a mapping of all Ethereum addresses to their respective balance, keeps track of the current total number of tokens minted, and has functions that can be called to transfer the token, approve others to transfer the token, and a couple other helper functions to do things like get the balance of another address.  \n\nNow, here's the important part.  When you receive an ERC-20 token, **those tokens are not actually \"in\" your wallet**.  Literally all that happened is there the single data structure that is part of this smart contract updated to increase your balance and decrease the senders.  This is all being managed by code inside a smart contract that could have been deployed by anybody.  There is **absolutely no guarantee** that the code for the smart contract for a given ERC-20 token does the same thing as other ERC-20 token contracts, implements the standard correctly, or is free of malicious code and\/or backdoors.  When you interact with any ERC-20 token, you are interacting with code that is unique to that token, and it can do things you might not expect.\n\nThis is important to understand, because a lot of people believe that all ERC-20 tokens are essentially equal in terms of how you use them, and that once you have them in your wallet, you're safe as long as you don't touch them.  This is a bad assumption to make.  It is extremely easy for someone to make an ERC-20 token that has a built-in backdoor that would allow them to take the tokens from anybody else at any point.  It's also possible to fool people into thinking the smart contract is safe by releasing source code that doesn't actually match the code that was deployed with the smart contract.  This is a thing that happens, it's not just some crazy conspiracy theory idea.  People have even gotten source code audited professionally so they could appear legitimate, but then when they deploy it, it doesn't match the code that was audited.  Since the only truly visible part of a deployed smart contract is bytecode (and not human readable Solidity code), it can be hard to tell if small parts of the code have been tweaked to allow for malicious interaction with the contract.\n\nKeep this is mind when using ERC-20 tokens in the future.  Do not make bad assumptions.\n\nBonus PSA: NFTs are ALSO just tokens governed by smart contracts that (hopefully) implement the ERC-721 standard.  They, too, can contain backdoors to yoink the NFT out from under you any time the creator wants.  You do **not** actually own these assets.  There is simply a variable that lists you as the current owner in the smart contract, which can be modified by other functions in the contract.","upvote_ratio":0.82,"created_utc":1678571919.0},{"title":"Satoshi didn\u2019t create BTC for us to worry about the 10-year bond rate or interest rates in general.","author":"I_was_bone_to_dance","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/11oling\/satoshi_didnt_create_btc_for_us_to_worry_about\/","text":"SVB apparently had a shit ton of 10-year bonds.

In this post the crypto fear and greed index will be analyzed for 2023.\n\n**For the people that are not familiar with the crypto fear and greed index:**\n\nThe fear and greed index is a metric that measures the (emotional) sentiment of the market. The score goes from 0 to 100. A score closer to zero means that the market is in extreme fear and a score closer to hundred indicates that the market is in extreme greed. The score is determined by the following aspects: Volatility, Market Momentum\/Volume, Social Media, Surveys, Dominance and Trends.\n\n**The crypto fear and greed index right now:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[The crypto fear and greed index is at 33 on the 11th of March 2023](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/cqbqm7v7n5na1.png?width=365&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=768ec240fdcb16b2724d01d8241fbeac623c684d)\n\nToday on the 11th of March we hit a score of 33, which indicates that the market sentiment is in fear. This has all to do with the recent turmoil in the market.\n\n**The crypto fear and greed index in the past month:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[The crypto fear and greed index in the past month](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/6ue7pohsn5na1.png?width=1132&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=6af7fd75ec9e663a4ab6d984dfad4e83ccf2a119)\n\nIn the past month we had hit a score of 62 on February the 16th. From that day the score has steadily declining until March the 8th. The days after the 8th of March the score took a plunge due to the banking problems and the effects on USDC and other stablecoins. Also the SEC actions took a role in the current market sentiment. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The crypto fear and greed index in the past 3 months:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[The crypto fear and greed index in the past 3 months](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/e7tghyo6p5na1.png?width=1141&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e5c4ce4ecaf975010b6e98370888f9cc6fd7eecc)\n\nIn this graph we can see that on January the 11th we started an uptrend with the small uprise in crypto. The score on that day was 26. After that day there was a steady increase in the crypto fear and greed score until the 8th of March. Next the plunge started mentioned in the previous graph.\n\n**What to expect now?**\n\nIn my opinion it all depends on the effect on the current banking crisis. The real consequences for the failing of Silvergate and SVB is still unknown. Also it will be interesting to see if more banks are in trouble. In the upcoming weeks we will know more for sure. \n\nAlso we have to wait on what the SEC will do with all their plans and regulations in the crypto industry. \n\nSource: [https:\/\/alternative.me\/crypto\/fear-and-greed-index\/](https:\/\/alternative.me\/crypto\/fear-and-greed-index\/)","upvote_ratio":0.81,"created_utc":1678561421.0},{"title":"South Korea Invests in Metaverse Fund for Economic Growth","author":"Right-Shopping9589","url":"https:\/\/blockchain.news\/news\/south-korea-invests-in-metaverse-fund-for-economic-growth","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.5,"created_utc":1678646281.0},{"title":"Crypto is stressful as all hell","author":"ChaotixEDM","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/11p10dk\/crypto_is_stressful_as_all_hell\/","text":"Only been involved since 2021 but even so i feel like i've been sucker punched, beatdown, almost killed.

I don't actively check my staking rewards and it just never stood out to me.\n\nI spoke with a Coinbase chat agent who told me my staking rewards were paused because I had registered a second account with Coinbase, and violated their policies. I assured the chat agent this was NOT the case and I'd never had any other accounts with Coinbase and asked for more information on this supposed 2nd account. They told me they'd open a support ticket and I'd hear back from Coinbase via email. I again asked for more info as I didn't want to have to wait days for an email if someone was out there registering accounts using my ID, and they refused to tell me anything and closed the chat so I couldn't keep asking questions. It was frustrating, to say the least.\n\nI tried calling their 1800 number, and of course it just sends you through an endless hell of robotic prompts and there's literally no way whatsoever to speak to a live agent. It literally tells you to submit a ticket online and hangs up and disconnects the call if you ask for that option.\n\nDays went by before I received the following copy\/paste email from Coinbase Support:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>*Thank you for reaching out to us.

No details on the fraudulent account or whether someone was using my personal info. No mention of the staking rewards. Just this generic, insultingly lazy email.\n\nI took a few days to calm down before responding but just sent a rather stern and direct email back, expressing my disappointment at the lack of urgency and customer service on their part. I asked why they quietly froze my staking rewards months ago when they first noticed the fraudulent account, instead of bringing it to my attention at the time so that I could take the steps needed to ensure my account was safe and to also contest the accusation that I had registered it myself (since I absolutely did not).\n\nIf they truly thought I registered a second account and didn't recognize it as fraud, then why didn't they at least give me some sort of notice that my staking was being frozen as a result? Why would they just secretly disable this feature without telling me, but continue to allow me to spend money on their exchange buying more tokens?\n\nMeanwhile, for the past few months I had absolutely NO knowledge that someone had attempted to register using my info - because they didn't tell me... and even now, I have no idea to what extent my identity was \"stolen.\" I don't know if this person just used a variation of my email (i have a gmail address and periods aren't recognized, so my assumption is someone used a variation of my email with a period in it because I've had this happen in the past with some other websites), or if they literally tried to register using stolen ID.\n\nAll of this being said... u\/Coinbase support needs to do better. Way better.

Gox, was launched, providing a platform for people to buy and sell Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nIn 2011, a digital black market called Silk Road was launched, becoming one of the most notorious online marketplaces for illegal drugs and other illicit goods and services.\n\nIn 2012, the major hack of the Mt. Gox exchange occurred, resulting in the theft of around 850,000 Bitcoin, worth at the time over $450 million.\n\nIn 2013, the price of Bitcoin surged to over $1,000 for the first time, as the cryptocurrency gained mainstream attention and interest.\n\nIn 2014, the Mt. Gox exchange filed for bankruptcy, further highlighting the need for improved security and regulation in the cryptocurrency industry.\n\nIn 2015, the Ethereum blockchain platform was launched, introducing smart contract technology and paving the way for the development of decentralized applications (dapps).\n\nIn 2016, a hack of the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) on the Ethereum blockchain resulted in the theft of millions of dollars worth of Ether, leading to a controversial hard fork of the Ethereum network.\n\nIn 2017, the price of Bitcoin reached an all-time high of nearly $20,000, before experiencing a sharp correction and volatility.\n\nIn 2018, the cryptocurrency market experienced a significant bear market, with prices dropping by more than 80% from their peak.\n\nIn 2019, the Facebook-led Libra cryptocurrency project was announced, sparking controversy and regulatory scrutiny.\n\nIn 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic and global economic uncertainty led to a surge in interest and investment in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, as investors looked for alternative assets and safe havens.\n\nIn 2021, the price of Bitcoin reached a new all-time high of over $65,000, as institutional investors and mainstream financial institutions began to embrace and invest in cryptocurrencies.\n\nIn 2022, we saw the bear market flourishing with Bitcoin experiencing a significant plunge hovering around $15,000, marking a 75% decline from its highest point.

That was just the start of the new bear market. The Fed pumped 1.5 TRILLION dollars into the stock market yesterday and it barely did a thing.

Many Redditors praised the game's mechanics and the ability to earn money by playing, even as a free-to-play player. However, one of this week's top threads in r\/CryptoCurrency paints a very different picture. The thread discusses Square Enix's new game, Forspoken, and how many gamers feel small and mid-sized titles are not performing as expected. However, the top comments in the thread shift the conversation to NFTs, with many replies expressing hatred towards them.\n\nIt's clear that opinions on gaming NFTs are divided, but it's important to acknowledge that they do have some useful applications in gaming. Here are some compelling arguments for why gaming NFTs are worthy:\n\n1. True Ownership: NFTs give players true ownership of their in-game assets. This means that players can buy, sell, and trade their assets as they wish, just like physical collectibles. This has the potential to create an entirely new economy within gaming, with players able to profit from their virtual assets.\n2. Play-to-Earn: Play-to-earn games, like the one that was mentioned ( Gods Unchained ), offer a way for players to earn money by playing. While it's true that this may not be a substantial source of income, it's still a way for players to earn some extra crypto while enjoying their favorite games.\n3. Personal Choice: Ultimately, it's up to the player to decide whether or not they want to participate in NFT gaming. Players who are interested in owning their in-game assets and earning money through play-to-earn games have the option to do so, while those who are not interested can choose to play traditional games without NFTs.\n4. Play for Fun: It's important to remember that playing games should be fun, not a second job. While play-to-earn games may offer a way to earn money, it's important for players to remember that they should be playing because they enjoy the game, not just for the monetary rewards.\n\nThe gaming NFT discussion on Reddit has been a rollercoaster ride, with opinions on the topic shifting from week to week. While there are certainly valid criticisms of gaming NFTs ( people will cheat\/ use bots to profit - but this is already done in other games as well, it's not like it will be something new ) , it's important to remember that they do have some useful applications in gaming, including true ownership, decentralization, and play-to-earn mechanics. Ultimately, it's up to each individual player to decide whether or not they want to participate in NFT gaming and to make that decision based on their personal preferences and values.  \n\n\n  \nTL;DR :  NFTs have potential benefits in gaming.

Now all the focus should be at trying to identify where this downwards is going and we should do some damage-control of the effects of the fear over the last days.\n\nOne very good way to do that is to use one of the most popular indicators, the Relative-Strength Index  (RSI). This is used to see the speed and direction of a certain move, which will be illustrated on a scale of 0 to 100. There 50 builds the border of oversold (bearish) to being above 50, meaning overbought (bullish).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Chart from Matthew Hyland on Twitter](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/ezbgosses5na1.jpg?width=1181&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2f1a2c0e82c580e8b57827588bea784d6c9ca560)\n\nHere we can see the RSI over the last months, after our rally in early of this year it even exploded to levels not seen since the 2021 bull run, which makes sense if you look at the parabolic run-up.

I will try to keep as brief as possible.\n\nFirst of all some basic stuff we all know. Both are L2 protocol that solve the gas and speed problem of L1 ethereum chain\n\n**FOUNDERS:**\n\nOptimism was founded in 2019 by Jinglan Wang, Karl Floersch and Kevin Ho.The team started it as a non profit organization caleed \"plasma group\".The stack is open source so that anyone can see it.\n\nThe Matic Network was launched in 2017 by four Mumbai-based software engineers: Jaynti Kanani, Sandeep Nailwa, Anurag Arjun, and Mihailo Bjelic. A large part of the project is open source.\n\nBoth of them have a strong team but OP is better here in my opinion.\n\n**TOKENOMICS:**\n\nOptimism has eth for gas fees on its chain and with only 7.3% current circulating supply I believe a lot of selling pressure is going to come on the OP token as it is just a govenance token.\n\n[Image from coingecko](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/b776oy8iz4na1.png?width=753&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=1029e75998f194804ad682da63e17000eac8fd8d)\n\nMatic has a current circulating supply of 87% . The demand can counter the remaining supply release as it is the used for gas and various other uses. Also a proper burn system that burns roughly 0.27% of tokens every year (it ain't much but its honest work).\n\n[Image from coingecko](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/6ola7q3bz4na1.png?width=753&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=71cebe43574c01cc2b52b486f1be3aad4e14753f)\n\nclearly Matic is a winner here\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**GOVERNANCE:**\n\nOP token lets you participate in the optimism collective that is two tier governance system containing token house(vote with token) and citizens house(vote with their membership NFT).This system of praised by Vitalik Buterin as well\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/1v9nw4od05na1.png?width=1488&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a789ecee84949cf375ea5246e9f9ec5f813ec278\n\nMatic : WTF is this governance we don't believe in it.

Optimism uses  fraud proof system to ensure the integrity of the transactions. Optimism's Optimistic Rollup can handle up to 2,000 transactions per second (TPS). However, Optimism is still in its early stages and has not yet reached its full potential\n\nPolygon: Polygon uses Plasma and Optimistic Rollups. It uses fraud proof system called TrueBit, which is more efficient and scalable. Polygon's network has achieved a TPS of over 7,000 on its Optimistic Rollup solution. Polygon has also implemented other Layer 2 solutions such as Plasma, which can further improve TPS.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMatic is current winner but things may change in future.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Current Chain Usage (Live TPS) and TVL:**\n\nOP:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/4gd0x14y05na1.png?width=1143&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=402aad8b34bf9aa9deb8446753098fa256086f0f\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Image from DefiLlama](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/wtt04o6215na1.png?width=636&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=1d6588255ab92ff2caa9eaf4e73469536f02cad4)\n\nMATIC:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/kh6lk52115na1.png?width=1140&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c14cadab741d9e59683c54342bf8e8290503e37c\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/vsjo87c515na1.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=530faaad54dabc1041a2e623cde8ceb8d74cf92e\n\nMATIC is current winner because of age factor.\n\n**Some Notes:**\n\nI have not compared them on number of Dapps as optimism is quite new and polygon has been here since longer duration and thus has significantly higher number.\n\nBoth Optimism and Matic are not very ideal when it comes to decentralization. However, both have them have plans to change this.\n\nOP also has a bad history of hacks and mismanagement of token in airdrop but will cover it later.

Eight hours later, I kind of wish I had chosen something else, but I think it is worth looking into what happens in different SVB insolvency scenarios and the knock-on effects, particularly to DAI. I wrote out portions of this in a comment in another thread but I think looking at the math is worthwhile.\n\nFirst off, let's look at how much exposure Circle has to SVB, and therefore how much is at risk: with $3.3B in SVB, against \\~41B USDC in circulation. As a percentage, 8% of USDC collateral is at risk.\n\nNext, let's talk about what happens if Circle experiences a liquidity crunch and must dispose of assets on their balance sheet. They likely take a small haircut on the short term bonds, maybe 1-2%. Theoretically these assets are very liquid, but I suppose if they cannot quickly dispose of them there could be a run-on-the-bank situation. Expect US Government conservatorship in that case and a long time for redemptions to happen. Otherwise we can say that about another 2% of the USDC collateral is at risk.\n\nIf SVB is completely insolvent with ABSOLUTELY 0 ASSETs - in other words, creditors get nothing - that means that the full collateral held by SVB for Circle goes to zero. Backing for USDC is 92 cents on the dollar, and there could be a run on the bank. The assets on Circle's balance sheet are liquidated, and in the end we end up somewhere around 90 cents collateral for every USDC in circulation. Maybe they are bailed out, maybe they undergo bankruptcy proceedings for insolvency. It could take some time (potentially years) to get money back out but basically there's a 10% hit for anyone holding USDC, in addition to whatever you calculate your time value of money to be.\n\nIf SVB is only somewhat upside down, say 50% of their debts can be covered by their assets, then \\~4% of USDC is at risk. Once again, assume a run on the bank, Circle enters insolvency and has to dispose of assets at less than ideal prices, and we get to 95 cents on the dollar. This could take years as we wait on assets from both SVB and Circle to return to the market.\n\nNow let's look at what this means for a stablecoin like DAI, with significant USDC exposure. You can see on the Maker Burn site that there is a significant amount of USDC exposure - $\\~3.5B. There is another $5B in other assets. Collateralization ratio is 150%. There are 5.77B DAI in circulation against $8.5B in collateral. The Maker Burn site: [https:\/\/makerburn.com\/#\/rundown](https:\/\/makerburn.com\/#\/rundown)\n\n[Stablecoin Collateral](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/nnnwa99x82na1.png?width=2040&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d39e94c7a8cfc3995d7b104d5680db6a886db933)\n\n[Overall Collateral](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/vn6j7kjy82na1.png?width=1958&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=101a227a16cb31afa69bc9f098fa095a3233faec)\n\nWhat does this mean for DAI? Well, in the worst case I outlined above, USDC goes to 90 cents. That means that for DAI, USDC collateral value would drop to 3.15B. Overall collateralization would be $8.1B on 5.7B DAI. It might take time for that full value to be available, however, because the velocity of money is clearly going down.\n\nI suppose if USDC somehow goes to zero, which I think is unlikely, then it would be accurate to say that there would be a collateral shortfall for DAI - something like $700M. However, I think this is a fairly unrealistic scenario. USDC can drop below 20 cents, \\~17 cents, and DAI is still fully collateralized.\n\nA few things that this does not consider:\n\n* How much do we believe in MakerDAOs liquidation mechanisms?\n* Are we at all concerned that as USDC crashes the other collateral crashes and cannot be liquidated before DAI is insolvent?\n* What if we include the GUSD backing and issues that Gemini might be having right now?\n\nI think these are worth further consideration but it's late right now and I'll have to come back to continue the analysis. For now, however, I am going to sleep decently soundly expecting my DAI positions to probably hold up, even if it takes some time to get back to the peg.\n\nIf I'm wrong I look forward to the inevitable embarrassment and jokes you all send my way in a few months.","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1678518923.0},{"title":"Curve Finance trading volume reaches $7B historic high","author":"Jocogui","url":"https:\/\/www.investing.com\/news\/cryptocurrency-news\/curve-finance-trading-volume-reaches-7b-historic-high-after-usdc-depeg-3028167","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.56,"created_utc":1678565683.0},{"title":"What the SVB collapse and stablecoin depeggings could mean","author":"hearsdemons","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/11oobje\/what_the_svb_collapse_and_stablecoin_depeggings\/","text":"A few days ago, crypto-friendly bank Silvergate went under and wiped out $100 billion from the crypto market. \n\nNow we have the Silicon Valley bank debacle.\n$40 billion dollars has, so far, been pulled out of SVB from depositors. \n\nAnd now we find out that Circle, the issuer of USDC, has money held up in both Silvergate and SVB. It has $3.3 billion stuck at Silicon Valley bank. USDC has already depegged and is sitting at 0.91 at the time of this writing. \n\nIt\u2019s too early to tell what this mean for USDC and everyone is just waiting for the next shoe to drop. Waiting to see what the FDIC does and if SVB depositors will be made whole again. The issue is FDIC deposits are insured up to $250,000 and SVB depositors were tech start-ups who had more than that, in USDC. \n\nThis is what Circle Chief Strategy Officer just said: \n\n> \"Circle is currently protecting USDC from a black swan failure in the U.S. banking system,\" Circle chief strategy officer Dante Disparte posted to Twitter. \"Silicon Valley Bank is a critical bank in the U.S. economy and its failure\u2014without a Federal rescue plan\u2014will have broader implications for business, banking and entrepreneurs.\"[Source](https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/digital-assets\/2023\/03\/11\/43-billion-nightmare-sudden-circle-depeg-could-be-about-to-crash-the-price-of-bitcoin-ethereum-bnb-xrp-cardano-dogecoin-polygon-and-solana\/amp\/)\n\n\nBecause USDC is such a big player in the crypto space, it\u2019s fall could trigger a domino effect. We\u2019re already seeing that with DAI, another stablecoin on the ethereum blockchain. The problem is USDC represents 51% of DAI\u2019s collateral. If USDC falls, it can take DAI down with it. DAI has depegged and is 0.93 at the time of this writing. \n\n\nSo the immediate effect of Silvergate and SVB debacle is that it has depegged USDC and DAI. If these two major stablecoin don\u2019t find their pegging, that will spell doom for crypto and bring about a crypto winter. \n\nWhy? Because stablecoins were supposed to be a safe alternative to fiat. Big players, like tech start ups and other big whales, who thought bitcoin and eth fluctuations were too spicy went to stablecoins. For these guys, it\u2019s stabelcoins or bust. \n\nAnd if the whales begin moving money out of USDC and DAI and exiting the crypto space, that will tank the crypto market for the foreseeable future. \n\nIf big money leaves, it will be like the old days when crypto was dominated by the little guy, the small investors.

Keep price slippage in mind if you decide to trade, although that's not so bad these days thanks to ETH\/MOON pool liquidity many r\/cc members are providing.\n\nAs the price of MOON has gone up this morning the difference remains the same, where SushiSwap stays almost $0.02 ahead of CMC and further than that ahead of Gecko.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/dwor7hb4k4na1.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c5afa383fa5803407d90506db155cd619af23b90\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/v40f5d0fk4na1.png?width=271&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b6fb1f889e5f0b8faaf23953a6ff98b2c9137474\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/pr32x6ehk4na1.png?width=401&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=18038ebeda8be29c6857f6116ee140006deddb02\n\nAs you can see, right now SushiSwap says MOON is worth $0.25 and Coin Gecko says just $0.225.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**UPDATE: For those thinking MEXC and other exchanges are the reason, that does not appear to be the case.

There are far more positive reviews but it is still concerning to hear people have lost their crypto when in cold storage.

If I DCA every week, then at what point is it considered good practice to deposit the tokens to the ledger?\n\nAdditionally, how does the Ledger Live app work?

Your wallet details are your login details, so there is no longer a need to create what are essentially replica accounts for all of these different websites. Fewer login accounts attached to  websites means fewer resources expended on storing and maintaining relevant data;\n* In a Web 3 universe people are more likely to spend money online on a wider variety of products, including tipping others for services, online newspapers and blogs and video content. I believe this would be the case because the initiation and processing of payments would be much smoother in a Web 3 universe. This is in part because there would be less of a need for an intermediary in banks, which in turn makes online payments much simpler and CHEAPER to execute. Some people today still feel weird about making a $1 payment via a card, and more times than not, the opportunity for such a transaction isn't possible as a result of high merchant banking fees.

Now there are two scenarios that can play out:\n\n1.**Bailout by another bank**\n\nAnother bank can takeover SVB & pay back the creditors & depositors of the bank. If this doesn't happen in a week or two, it won't happen at all. It's like the FTX situation we saw earlier in terms of a bailout, if nobody steps in within 1-2 weeks, a bailout is unlikely since it means nobody wants to touch that mess. \n\n2.**FDIC bailout**\n\nAs opposed to FTX collapse, SVB is a bank, so FDIC has to step in.\n\nFDIC will first start selling any assets like bonds to pay out the minimum $250k FDIC insured amount to the depositors. But we already know that interest rates are high which lowers the value of those bonds. So the actual hole might be greater than 8.25% considering the liquidity crunch.\n\nNext, FDIC can issue an \"Advance dividend\" to cover a percentage (x%) of the uninsured amount & paid to depositors & creditors. This % is determined by various factors.\n\nWhat is Advanced dividend?\n\nIt's basically is a payment made by FDIC to uninsured depositors in case of a bank collapse.\n\n### Value of USDC\n\n- As of now the value of USDC must be considered at $0.9175 since there's an 8.25% hole on circle's balance sheet.\n\n- After receiving the FDIC insured $250k + assuming a generous 50% advanced dividend, That'll still leave a hole of 4% on circle's balance sheet. At this point the value of USDC can be considered around $0.96\n\n- But all this is optimistic, in reality USDC is having a bank run & it doesn't matter that there's only an 8.25% or ~4% hole (in best case scenario), the selloff pressure will tank the price. \n\n- I'm sure there will be a lot of rebounds & hopes for re-peg, but math is math, a 8.25% ($3.3B) deficit is no small amount. \n\n- Unless option 1 happens & another bank takes over, a re-peg to 1$ is highly unlikely.","upvote_ratio":0.67,"created_utc":1678546475.0},{"title":"Alright guys, banks have been folding and fear mongering as been starting to surface..","author":"JayFab6061","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/CryptoCurrency\/comments\/11o8zh3\/alright_guys_banks_have_been_folding_and_fear\/","text":"I\u2019m a avid lurker here in this sub and I\u2019m kinda of active when I\u2019m not busy working.
