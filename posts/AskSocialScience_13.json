I only really know the American experience first-hand so I'm just going to speak from that perspective.\n\nAnyway, there's a lot of talk about left media and right media, news outlets that offer programming with a clear political perspective and it encompasses a wide variety of forms like newspaper, television, radio etc. (I suppose a distinction should be made between old-school media formats and new media but I'm not sure how it can be applied exactly. imo any news outlet that offers internet platforms are basically the same in terms of the relationship between producer/consumer and the big difference between old/new media is the \"active\" type of consumption that users can do in the latter)\n\n\"echo chamber\" is the word I hear most to describe the media environment today. The big fear is, I guess, that people will self-segregate themselves into only listening to media that fits their viewpoints. But isn't this a sign that the media is just acting like an industry and catering to those perspectives? \n\nIn short, I just don't think that \"the media\" has all that much power in terms of getting a liberal to vote conservative or for a conservative to vote liberal. I know that a liberal is unlikely to be swayed by Biased Media Outlet A just like a conservative is unlikely to be swayed by Biased Media Outlet B.\n\nHow much 'power' does the media even have?",

B/c he said it in a podcast there was no source.

        "text": "So given my interpretation about criminals, criminals do all sorts of things for many, many reasons and it is not directly related to the classical school of thought which says that criminals do certain things because of pure conscious and calculated choice (well, not all of them anyway)\n\nSome do those things because they can like organised crime or drug cartels like Pablo Escobar, or perhaps psychopathic criminals like Ted Bundy (although Bundy's psychopathy is still a bit unclear because there seems to be no clear trigger on why he did what he did). Some do those things because they have no choice (like poverty or perhaps internalised beliefs that limited their actions). Some do so because of unconscious conflicts that affected their behaviours or their sub-conscious like the Unabomber or Leonarda Cianciulli (the Italian Human Flesh Soap Maker)\n\nAlthough I firmly believe that it is blend of the unconscious and conscious side of the human mind because of most of our efforts (if not all of them) are influenced by our unconscious such as internalised beliefs, experiences affecting our thoughts and behaviours and so on. Although if we choose or allow such behaviours to occur (not necessarily criminal activity), it is mostly a conscious or subconscious effort (albeit that the unconscious is tricky to be aware of and go into and hopefully change some of the factors that are inside your unconscious)\n\n(some examples are like the Italian Human Soap Maker, Charles Mason because of his upbringing and so on)\n\nSo I often understand the complex nature of criminals and the complex choices how to view them where I should not immediately demonise them as nonhuman or less than human as the trope often does (like in popular TV shows, the criminals are often the antagonists), even though some criminals may provoke me behave like this given their conscious efforts to commit certain crimes, and at the same time, I know that some criminal behaviours are done by unconscious or unaware factors that affected their actions and some criminals can be rehabilitated back into society as functioning and well-adjusted people\n\nGiven what I just mentioned (in a very brief manner) on how criminals do certain crimes, I am still a bit puzzled about why some people would want to glorify and even try to copy the behaviours and actions of certain criminals.\n\nFame is the one that pops up in my head but what kind of fame exactly? Fame amongst the world because they did something shocking and unorthodox? Fame in the form of intimidation? Fame in the criminal underworld to gain respect?\n\nHow about internalised beliefs that affected their thoughts and behaviours like beliefs from their own upbringing or perhaps beliefs that they unconsciously or consciously internalised (whether they are psychopathic by nature or not)?",

Don't make this post a nightmare for the mods.\n\nIn online discussions of cultural appropriation, specifically pertaining to the dress worn to prom and posted to Twitter, I have noticed a pretty wide disparity in the opinions of minority persons on the subject of cultural appropriation. Most of my minority friends who have cared to weigh in from my local area find the controversy ridiculous or have mild feelings about it at most. By contrast, friends of friends from other areas tend to be more hostile to the girl who wore the dress.\n\nMy local area, Houston, is comparatively well-integrated at least in my unprofessional assessment of [The Racial Dot Map](https://demographics.virginia.edu/DotMap/index.html). Self-reporting and Facebook-snooping of several of the people with conflicted or hostile feelings about the dress has so far yielded the result that those people are from segregated areas.\n\nMy hypothesis is that people from segregated areas are more likely to deem things \"cultural appropriation\" and thus more offensive than those from areas with better integration, because people from segregated areas are more likely to have been denied the opportunity to engage in their cultures without hostility.\n\n#####**My question, then, is whether my hypothesis has any validity. Has this been studied at all? Could the answer be synthesized from existing data?**\n\nIf it were true, I think it would tell us something valuable about several different things including online discourse. When something like a dress gets posted online, it transcends local culture where that might be more acceptable and gets presented to an online crowd that has a very different lived experience from minorities in the original poster's area.\n\nThoughts?",

However, there are social psychologists that study group processes and I'm sure sociologists that are concerned with individual perceptions/emotions/cognition. \n\nCould someone articulate the distinction better than me?\n\nEDIT: From some conversation, it seems like both fields are interested in *pretty much* the same types of topics and research questions to the point that there isn't *that* meaningful of a distinction to be made there. However, social psychologists *primarily* do experiments, while *most* sociologists do not use experimental methods in the sense of randomized controlled experiments. ",

I want to learn more, which means looking up academic articles, but I don't know the words to search! My crappy stories are below. Any help much appreciated.\n\n***\n\n1. When information moves from \"That's ridiculous it must be false\" to \"That's *so* ridiculous it must be true.\" For example, if I say I walk 10 dogs at once that might seem ridiculous; however, if I say I walk 100 dogs at once it becomes so ridiculous a person may think there's some unknown fact allowing me to operate as an outlier like that. **What's that movement in belief called? Is there a term for that type of information?**\n\n1. Social time efficiency due to technology advancements. So, 20 years ago I would need to spend X hours finding news and related news articles and today I spend Y hours, where Y is less than X, to find an equivalent amount of news and related news articles. This gives me extra time (the difference between X and  Y) to do anything else; however, given that I'll still spend X hours a day on news I can now read more news in the same amount of time resulting in an echo chamber and information overload. It's like I was given the ability to specialize in a skill but am not spending the excess time gained doing other activities. **Is there a term for this gain in time that I'm not spending doing other things?**\n\n1. Ideas that become more reinforced, either exponentially or linearly, due to group size increases. For example, if I'm in a group of 7 people and I think it's cold out but the other 6 find it warm, I'm likely to spend less time thinking about the cold. If I'm in a group of 700, the probability someone else thinks it's cold increases and I'll spend time with them and more time thinking about the cold. **Is there a term for population growth that assists in grouping people of similar beliefs? Is there a term for the grouping of people in large populations and the inability to group in smaller populations?**\n\n***\n\nHope the odd stories make sense and you can help me find a condensed term for them!\n\nIf you'd like more details please ask but understand I'll probably mess up the terminology.",

The first he notes is \"The objective modernity of nations to the historians' eye vs. their subjective antiquity in the eyes of nationalists.\"  \nNow, of course the *Nation-State* is a modern beast, but what is he refering to when he says the different entity, the just-nation, is modern in the eyes of historians and ancient in the eyes of nationalists?  \nThe Declaration of Arbroath seems to make reference to a Scottish Nation ^(distinct from the Gaelic race shared with Ireland, as is refered to in Bruce's letter, iirc, 5 years prior).  \nI am less well read in the history of Japan, but can we not see a Nation in japan long before the modernist \"state\" emerges? Similar in parts of china?  \n\nAny insights here would be useful, because whilst I am broadly persuaded by Anderson's argument, this has long confused me.  Hopefully better luck here :)",

My angle as a graduate student in psychology of language, is that all phenomenon are created through language, and of course the same would be valid for clinical depression. If we didn’t have the term “depression”, would the condition exist?   \n\nBy research I have found that in todays society the terms ”i am depressed” and ” it is depressing” are used casually. How does the use of these terms impact the diagnosis, clinical depression, if at all?\n\nAs my baseline, I will be using social constructivism as my theoretical compass. Further I will use Goffmans theory regarding “stigma” to uncover if and how the increasing use of the clinical terms \\(depressed/depressive/depression\\) are aiding the de\\-stigmatization of individuals with clinical depression.\n\nI would also like to use Foucault and his subject\\-positioning theory, to analyze the way, that the diagnosis is being used as a positioning tool in the public discourse. Furthermore I’m interested in looking into his “Madness and Civilization” – maybe some of you can give me some pointers on where to start? \n\nIf anyone has some theories or papers about the above mentioned topics, or some ideas about some discourse analysis theories I should look in to, please let me know. \n\nI need all the help I can get and everything is appreciated!
