        "text": "I don't know how to phrase this perfectly but... given our state of technological advancement now, is it nearly certain that every technological advancement that would have been possible to achieve in the 19th century has been discovered/invented by now in 2023? I'm not an expert in anything in particular, but there are various innovations throughout history that have a certain quirkiness about them, although they are fully logical in retrospect. Things like maybe the Archimedes screw, or the steam engine, or moveable type, or the compass... all of them seem to have a certain \"bolt out of the blue\" moment of inspiration aspect, yet they all do in fact exist. I'm certainly neither smart nor creative enough to come up with ideas for technologies that could have been around for centuries but have never been discovered but... is there a world in which \"Archimedes lamps\" or \"chain orbs\" or \"sparcoloptometers\" could have been around for centuries and useful for humanity the entire time and leading to subsequent innovations even now, yet no one has ever thought of them to this day? Or is it pretty much guaranteed that given the natural progression of things, all of the possible gaps in technology from earlier eras would have been filled in by now? (Certain impressive yet functionless things like fireworks and such I would consider novelties, and there are surely plenty other trivial baubles and diversions that could have been invented at any time.)",

It will slowly come to realized that over half a millennia of epistemology that separated nature from culture and technology, was a burden we never had to live with in the first place. It's like a major existential crisis on a collective level. The human that comes out the other side, if they do, will be so very different from us.",

        "text": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6443620/\n\nWill there be drug-free anesthesia methods in the near future? Anesthetic drugs cause changes in the brain, and impact cognitive ability in some studies. Furthermore, they are neurotoxic in animal models. There is also possible brain damage caused by the surgery itself (surgical inflammation causes cytokines to enter the brain), but this seems simpler to resolve as some anti-inflammatories seem to be able to mitigate the damage.\n\nAs the population is aging and the demand for surgery (cosmetic as well) is increasing, I wonder if scientists are looking for anesthetic alternatives or if they consider the current ones are \"good enough\".\n\nWhat do you think?",
