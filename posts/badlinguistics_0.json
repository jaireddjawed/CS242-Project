        "text": "R4: As I will explain here, this \"sPeCuLaTiOn\" is chock-full of instances of bad phonetics, though the first one might be a little less extreme than the rest.\n\n* **·Ñº** is assigned the value /Œ∏/, a consonant that did not exist in either Early Middle Chinese or Late Middle Chinese (at least according to respectable scholars). Yet, it's worth noting that, in traditional Chinese phonetic terminology, the term \"dental\" refers to alveolar sibilant consonants, so this particular description according to which ·Ñº is /Œ∏/ might be due to a misnomer; in fact, the corresponding Chinese character is later described as having the initial /s/.\n* **„Öø** is compared with \"Standard Chinese Pinyin: Â≠ê z \\[ts…®\\]; English: z in zoo or zebra; strong z in English zip\". Phonetically speaking, the *z* of Chinese Pinyin is NOT remotely close to English *z*; Chinese *z* is a voiceless, unaspirated affricate (although it does become a bit voiced when being part of a syllable with \"light tone\"), while English *z* is a voiced fricative. It's also described, in North Korean usage, as a liquid; this in particular is legitimately true, [as it was in fact used for such a value in a short-lived morpho-phonemic North Korean spelling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Korean_Orthography#Contents).\n\nThese two are just the tip of the iceberg. Behold the more extreme badphon below:\n\n* ·Öê \"/tÕ°…ï/\" and ·Öë \"/dÕ° ë/\" are described as retroflex, which obviously contradicts the IPA transcriptions they used. (By that very standard, the IPA glyphs /tÕ° Ç/ and /dÕ° ê/ should represent the true alveolo-palatal affricates.)\n* „ÜÑ /f ∞/ = German \"pf\"?\n* ·ÑΩ /z/ and ·Ñø / ë/ are aspirates? No. Just no.\n\nFrom all these egregious instances of bad phonetics, I can't help assuming that the person responsible for this edit lacked proper knowledge of phonetics and the IPA",

        "text": "Without actually counting, I would guess that I end up removing about half of the posts here because they don't follow R3 or R4. Sometimes this is a real shame because they're funny as hell.\n\nChanging the rules isn't an option, because they're there to address serious issues (and have mostly worked for that). Not removing the posts also isn't an option. If it violates R3 it just has to go, and removing the post is really the only good way of enforcing R4. I've tried temporarily removing the post pending edits to the R4 comment, but they usually don't ever edit it. In the past I also tried short temporary bans to get people's attention on the rules, but it mostly had no effect because the people who break these rules are usually first-time posters.\n\nSo, I'm toying with the idea of posting removed links to the small posts thread, as a kind of \"free to anyone who wants to post it and actually follow the rules\" thing. Would you all be interested in that? Would any of you want to post them? How mad would you be about it? Is there any reason this is a terrible idea that I'm not thinking of?",
