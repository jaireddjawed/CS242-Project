He brushes past some firemen arriving on the scene, sticks his head through an open window and sucks all the smoke out of the building, allowing the firefighters to rush in, put out the fire and save the lives of everyone in the pub. As they're coming out, one fireman turns to the farmer and says, \"Wow, that was amazing! How did you suck all the smoke out of the pub? It's a miracle!\"  \n\nThe farmer looks at him, winks, and replies, \"I'm an ex tractor fan.\"",

        "text": "to his high school sweetheart. Being shy and respectful of the girl he loved so much, he had never made the big play. \n\nThe day before his wedding, he talks to his dad. \"Pop, I've never done it with Mary Sue, and I'm worried she might have had other men before me. How can I tell?\"\n\nDad thought for a minute and said, \"Junior, just before you go into bed with her, whip it out and show it to her, and say 'What do you call THIS?' If she says it's a Penis, you can be pretty sure she ain't been foolin around. But if she calls it a DICK, it's a sure bet she's had other men. \"\n\nSo, on their wedding night, Junior pulls out his Wang. Holding it in his hand, he says, \"Mary Sue, what do you call THIS??\n\nShe looks him in the eye and says,  \"Why, that there is a Penis.\"\n\nJunior smiled sweetly at her and said, \"Honey, you have no idea how happy I am that you didn't call it a Dick.\"\n\nShe looks a little confused, but then she holds her hands about a foot apart and says,  \"Oh no, honey. A Dick is THIS big. And black.\"",
