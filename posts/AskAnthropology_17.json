        "text": "From what I understand:\n\n* some farmers from the Zagros Mountains migrated eastwards eventually to the Punjab area and its surroundings. THEY migrated before 5000 BC, and eventually, they coalesced into the Indus Calley Civilization around 3000 BC. They were farmers with a very advanced culture. \n\n* Eventually, there were ecological pressures which contributed to the collapse of the IVC, and this also coincided with migrations of the IE people starting around 2500 BC. Many of the IVC inhabitants stayed there in the IVC, and some migrated towards the south. The ones that stayed adopted IE languages. The ones that migrated southwards continued speaking their Dravidian languages. \n\n* Agriculture was spread to south India by these Dravidian farmers who were migrating away from the Indo-Europeans (?)\n\nSo this brings me to some questions: \n\n* was agriculture introduced around 1500 BC by dravidians migrating southwards?\n* If not, when was agriculture occurring in southern India? When was it spread there?\n* Was southern India even appreciable populated in 2500 BC, and if not, why? I would think their soil, climate, and water supply were very conducive to sustaining a big population. \n",

        "text": "I'm currently researching the topic of prehistoric wars and violence in general. A central argument is about whether or not prehistoric people (or current \"primitive\" groups) even have \"proper\" battles or if they're all low-lethality, ritualistic affairs. A fairly common argument in favor of the latter view (low lethality) seems to revolve around the use of arrows or other ranged weapons in prehistoric European battles or current \"primitive\" engagements and that arrows were almost never lethal, hence lethality was not the goal of the engagement.  \nThat seems odd to me. I have yet to find any explanation as to why this should be the case, let alone any citation of a corresponding study. \"Ötzi\", the famous ice mummy, was shot by an arrow and that single shot was most likely lethal. Not only that but the arrow penetrated his Scapula, demonstrating quite clearly that at least some prehistoric bows were sufficiently powerful to inflict more than just surface wounds.  \nAnd while this might have been a lucky (or unlucky, depending on the perspective) shot, just because arrows weren't *immediately* lethal doesn't mean they weren't lethal at all. Wouldn't any hit to the lungs or abdomen have led to life-threatening injuries and infections? Speaking of infections, there are many ethnographic examples of arrows that weren't poisonous but modified to increase the risk of infection. Finally, there are very few preserved prehistoric bows but the drawings I've seen show fairly large, heavy weapons that could definitely have fired bone-penetrating arrows over at least a dozen meters or so, potentially penetrating the rib cage or even the skull. Are we to assume that those were only used for hunting and \"non-lethal\" bows for warfare? ",

        "text": " (The first two paragraphs are background information explaining how I came to learn of this event. If you already know what I'm referring to, feel free to skip to the final paragraph where I have enclosed all of my questions.)\n\nLong ago, I was in a college class that discussed some aspects of human nature. Recommended reading for the class was Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari. In that class, the professor had mentioned an event where Homo Sapiens had migrated Northward from Africa only to be beaten back by other species of the Homo genus who were better suited for those environments. It was through the ability to gossip and the complexity of Sapiens' language that we eventually settled that area and drove back the other human species. Unfortunately, that class only glossed over this and the professor was never able to provide any further information on this subject.\n\nJust the other day I purchased Harari's Sapiens and have been reading it in search of more information. I believe I have found the passage the professor was referring to (The first pages of Chapter 2: Tree of Knowledge). Harari even brings up the speculation that these early Sapiens did not possess the complexity of language or abstract thought like ourselves. But, much to my dismay, I do not see any citation or further reference to that first encounter in the text. This is what has led me to post here.\n\nFirstly, how do we know of this early human migration into the Arabian Peninsula? Are there records of this like the Caves of Lascaux, or do we have some other means of tracking human history in this period? Would temporary settlements and human tools have survived that long? I understand that we can date these tools with processes such as carbon dating, but how would we be able to determine that humans left and returned rather than just continuously inhabited the area? Do we know of any other such encounters?",

They use subject, object and possessive pronouns, but they put them in weird places sometimes making me the subject or we a pronoun.  And sometimes they forgo the gerund in favor of a Latinized noun like sufferation instead of suffering.  Are there any rules?  What led do this?  Does the Jamaican country have any of these dialect styliazations in their official grammar or vocabulary?

In Sparta, the gymnasium was institutionalized in the role of forcing recruited young Greek boys, by the age of twelve, into becoming homosexual warriors. The historian Plutarch writes:\nBy this age the boys came to be courted by lovers from among the respectable young men. The older men, too, showed even more interest, visiting the gymnasia frequently and being present when the boys fought and joked with one another. (5)\nThe sodomites agenda wants to see this same cruel tyranny established today, in order to build a homoerotic utopia where boys are recruited for a homosexual army, and the male body is exalted as the primal and pure physique of a warrior. Lets not forget what the Gay Manifesto says\n\nThe gay manifesto being satire off course (sigh)\n\nAnd\n&gt; Homosexual acts were not only encouraged and common, but imposed in the pagan world. In Sparta, for example, if you were a handsome man of good character and did not have a male lover at all, you were fined. The ancient scholar Aelian explains:\nAnd any man of good appearance and character who did not fall in love with someone well-bred was also fined, because despite his excellence he did not love anyone. (6)\nThe sodomites today want us to revert to the homosexuality of antiquity, and to force us to accept their ideology. This forced acceptance will only lead to forced participation in homosexual activities. \n\nIs he even reading his sources right? Was homosexuality that big then?

I'm also considering another minor in archaeology as the intro class I took was intro to archaeology, which I found very interesting and very broad. \n\nI was undecided until I narrowed my prospects to Poli Sci and Anthro, but I realized that Poli Sci would lead me to law school and with anthro I can be in a broader field. I'm enrolled in Forensic Anthropology for the fall and I saw that the teacher (professor? he is still working on his doctorate) is interested in law and medicine. \nSo, essentially my question is this- ***what the heck can I do with my degree???*** Rutgers' EA major requires me to study primates but I don't think I'm interested in it. To be honest, I found anthropology through the TV show Bones that ran on Fox and I thought what they did on the show (though I know it is probably overdramatized) was super interesting. (it can't be too inaccurate though, right? it was based on a real live forensic anthropologist.)\n\nAnywayyyy... besides research and teaching, what career can I make out of this degree?\n\nAlso, if grad school is a must, (I'm assuming this to be very much likely) where would you guys suggest? I do live in NJ so if the school was near that would be helpful. I have been looking into NYU's program but its NYU so I'm not sure I would be able to get in.

        "text": "Hi, which different types of exercise did huntergathers do? And in which order did they do them? Do you think the same as if you would guess. I believe most of their days looked like this: 1. Wake up and get up 2. forage for animals such as deer, wild boars etc. by running with bow, knife and stalking(low intensity) animals to, when one is close enough, shoot it and kill it. then they would lift the animals over their shoulders and carry at back to camp. Maybe they would push heavy trees across rivers if they needed to avoid dangerous currents. If the animal got hurt and resisted by attacking(lets say far ranged ammo of arrows ran out) the hunter that guy would explosively hit and push of the animal.\n\nThey rarily moved in my opinion and when they did they had to due to glaciers, floods and vecause of climate overall. In the move and during the relocating process they carried heavy and light things long ways, because it is not like it was freezing in one square kilometer and tropic climate in the one next to it. Also, I think that the hunting only had sprinting involved if the scenario was similar to this: 1. hunter throws knife or shoots animal with last arrow, 2. animal gets hurt. 3.animal runs but slower and staggers 4. Hunter\\`s camp has no food and so he needs to take down this animal without arrow and to do this he must sprint if he for example hit a boar or deer in the leg or in the behind area.\n\nI would say they did this most of the time: First low intensity cardio(hunting by stalking the animal by walking slowly and quickly, often for a long time) and afterwards high intensity workout in the form of heavy lifting of the dead animal or explosive short sprint to take down wounded animals by hand.\n\nAnd when they moved camp, which was not any daily routine, I think they kind of did both high an dlow intensity at the same time, they carried camp belongings, food etc.(heavy lifting for men probably) and walked long distances without stopping but sometimes they still stopped to sleep, eat, drink and rest for some hours and this rest was prolonged by breakfast preparation and consumption.\n\nCould the following exercise imitate hunters\\` sprints in forests? Run as fast as you can in one sprint burst until you can barely move, walk fast, repeat.\n\nThoughts about all of this?",

After living abroad for 5 years I decided to return to Anthropology and pursue an MA but I had no money so I chose an MA program in the university of Malaysia Sarawak on the island of Borneo. This school was offering a very affordable research MA. I chose that program because it would allow for interesting fieldwork options. Yet, not surprisingly, the support given at that institute was minimal at best. After several years of struggle with almost no assistance I did however managed to complete my thesis.   \n\n\nIn my thesis, I generated an entirely new theory of ethnographic research, tested that theory, and presented very positive results. My university finally approved my work and the examiners during my viva supported the positive outlook by saying that my work had made a significant contribution to Anthropology and Bornean Anthropology especially. This was the first time in history, far as I know, that my university said that about an MA work. One of the examiners actually told me that she was planning on using my method for her next research project. My work was also reviewed by the noted Anthropological Ontologist Martin Holbraad of the University College London who gave me a very positive review overall. I also received excellent feedback from the noted Iban scholar Clifford Sather who seemed to agree that I had created a significant and impressive ethnographic research tool. Every scholar that has reviewed my work agrees that it is very interesting and that I'm no doubt  destined for an excellent career, yet are all universally short on details for how I might go about doing that. \n\nWithout specific advice I feel lost and floating in space. I feel, by actually doing something interesting in my graduate work I've kind of shot myself in the foot and put myself into a difficult position. I'm not experienced enough to push forward on my own, yet my work is seemingly mature and original enough that most PHDs won't touch it because it seems out of their depth. That's my guess anyway. My work is also quite interdisciplinary; combining ethnography, narrantology, hermeneutics, screen writing, and community film making. So, most Professors feel unqualified to touch it making my journey to find a Phd supervisor a nightmare. \n\nIn my work I wanted to do something original and answer some of the serious questions brought forward by Viveiros De Castro, Roy Wagner, Martin Holbraad and others about the creative nature of ethnography and how to create a methodology which balances the epistemological stakes between the anthropologist and the native. I feel I was successful but that early success has left me in a strange lonely place where I don't know how to move forward.   \n\n\nCan anyone here offer me any advice. Please, I don't know what to do.   \n\n\nThank you ",

Also , protagonist of A Certain Magical Index  , do have couple of western female in his harem.

        "text": "So...I’m starting my MA degree in applied anthro in August and I must decide on a location to do research for my thesis. I don’t have a proposal written yet or even a strong central idea, but I’m hoping to propose a project on animal ethics, eating animals, edibility, maybe incorporating the livestock industry and vegetarianism/vegan movements. I don’t have it narrowed down yet. Oops.\n\nThe US might be a good place to do vegan/vegetarian movements because they’re probably more popular here than in other countries. I could also do livestock industry stuff too. The US is also one of countries that is like imperialistic and invades other countries with animal ethics, so....yeah.\n\nMy main concern is about funding. My uni might not fund my summer 2019 MA thesis research, so I plan on applying for an NSF and a Fulbright this Fall.\n\nAnyway, are funding agencies more likely to fund domestic (US) projects or projects that take place abroad? I may not get any internal uni funding or external funding...in the case Idk what I’d do. Maybe delay doing research until I could secure funding. (My program can be completed in 2-3 years).\n\nI can speak Spanish and French somewhat fluently and in undergrad I conducted ethnographic work in Central America.\n\n**also I should add that I understand that animal activism is imperialistic. I’m a a white American, so I practically embody imperialism.",

I was working on an ANTH 1010 course recently and it led me down a rabbit hole that introduced me to the Sentinelese. Now I'm in complete info-binge mode!\n\nI understand there is little information regarding them considering they are hostile to pretty much everyone, but I know contact has been made. It's hard to find any published information on them, and I'm just curious if anyone here can provide me links or resources to anything written about them.\n\nThanks!",

They are surely guilty of framing and sins of omission, but I feel like I can still get the gist of an event when looking at a few different sources left of center.\n\nI also just watched a great [TED Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VM6HZqQKhok) of a guy who left the neo-Nazi movement and have also reduced myself to some Facebook conversations about the border wall, and I can't help but notice the similarities in the appeal of the right's narrative to the story of inclusion that neo-Nazism offers as well as my friends' and family's style and color of their defense.  I know that both sides are biased, but not both sides feel biased equally, nor do they seem to produce the same representations of state, state power, immigrants, policy and so on in their target audiences.",
