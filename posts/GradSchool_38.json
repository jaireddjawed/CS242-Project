        "text": "In Science, Thesis Based MSc is always recommended, since it allows the student to gain research skills. However, it is often hard to find a supervisor for thesis-based MSc, therefore, some students opt for course based MSc. I was wondering how hard is it for such students to get into a PhD program later? Do professors usually prefer students who have research experience in MSc? Did anyone of you get into a PhD program after a course based MSc. If yes, then please mention the University and please mention how your PhD is going.\n\nThanks.",

For example, the probability class that I'm in rn would usually require a B- to declare the stats major. Now they switched it so you can do P/NP and if you get a P that would count to declare the major. I am planning to major in DS and minor in stats, and my goal is to do a master's program in DS. \n\nSo basically, I was wondering if anyone has any experience having a P on their transcript while applying to a master's program.

After 3 to 4 long years I finally had several interviews this year that went very well. I have been accepted into just one PA program that starts January 3, but it is an entirely new program and although I am excited about this prospect, I am more excited about vet school but will not get an answer from them until about two weeks after this program starts…\n\nI can’t turn down the only acceptance I have received after four years of applying, just in the hopes that my number one choice will give me an offer. The application process is grueling and I’ve lost count of the thousands I have spent in pursuit of this goal.\n\nMy question is, say I get accepted into vet school two weeks into a different/PA program. Is it possible to drop out of one to accept the other? \n\nThe PA program is a masters level program that would not have been on my transcripts or Vet school application. Just wondering if anyone has experience with this kind of situation, I realize I may have to forfeit tuition, but outside of that does it fuck up my application for financial aid to the second school? Is there some sort of academic body that would report this to the new university? Just trying to evaluate from all angles.",

As someone eventually seeking a career in diplomacy/conflict resolution, I thought Belfast’s history as an epicentre of conflict during The Troubles would compliment both my motivations and the program itself. The online reception to the school is mixed to say the least though—does anyone have any insight as to what I could expect?

I didn’t really think anything when he first said it because I was in the middle of a task and just saying the usual “ok ok ok” to speed up the conversation but afterwards it occurred to me what he had actually said. Like, what does Japanesey even mean?Am I being overtly sensitive on someone else’s behalf (my advisor and I are both white men) or am I in the right for bringing it to his attention.

I don't neccesarily feel like I'm being forced, because I do want to get my graduate degree and feel like it will be necessary for my career. But I feel like I'm at a bad point in my life right now and I'm really afraid that going to grad school is going to exacerbate everything thats going on. The thing is I'm sure theres no perfect time to go, it just has to get done. But I still have so many fears about going.\n\nI have no social life, and I keep hearing that grad school can ruin that for you, meanwhile I havent even been able to start a social life. I also have not started dating yet either, and I want to start trying within the next year. My mental health has been very bad lately, I'm in the process of finding a therapist after not having one for a few years. These days I find it hard to get out of bed and do a lot of the things I used to like doing. I'm also tired constantly. I always thought the next few years would be my chance to grow into myself by processing things, improving my habits, working on my anxiety, getting better sleep, things like that. I guess one thing about grad school is I'll be forced to have a better routine, which will be good for me. But I'm just wondering how much of that I can fit into one day. I also really value my hobbies and in undergrad I really needed the time away from my work, like everyone does I guess, in order to stay happy and productive.\n\nI still dont know what I'll be doing about work either, right now I'm working 40 hrs a week. How do people work part time or not work at all when they decide to go to grad school? I'm hoping thats an option for me, but if not I guess I will be doing graduate school part time. What is a full time job along with part time graduate school like? Would 1 or 2 classes a semester help with maintaining balance?\n\nI expect its not going to be easy, but I just hope I can remain happy and I can continue growing in other areas of my life while going. I just want to ensure that I can manage my stress and not get burned out.",

I discovered halfway through my college career that I HATED ES but was already a double major at this point and wanted to finish out both degrees. \n\nMy ES GPA isn’t Great and has affected my cumulative GPA while my social science and minor GPA is good (3.5+ after this semester and 3.34 respectively). It is also important to note I was in a gnarly car accident prior to the semester (not at fault) and have been dealing with legal and medical issues in the wake of the semester, as well as having to move suddenly all by myself as I go to university out of state \n\nThis may sound stupid but do I have any chance at all of getting into graduate school (masters and hopefully eventually doctorate) or is this unrealistic?

As such, totally willing to do a GMAT-type assessment just to have another thing to point to and say “look at how much I’ve grown the past 4 years!”\n\n(Other things is getting A in a la carte college classes in math to show that I’m academically capable, continuing working as a DS at a tech job, and do AI academic research at a think tank. Basically hustle hard!)\n\nNow why I ask about the LSAT because \n1) I potentially want to do law school two years after the math masters,\n2) I would prefer to take only 1 graduate test, and I think there are not that many law schools that accept the GMAT, and\n3) I have an uninformed hypothesis that the classes I did terribly in—aka logic, metaethics, legal studies—would be better “covered” by the LSAT than the GMAT. \n\nIn other words, if I get a high LSAT score, there’s a higher chance that adcom will say “wow this person has definitively improved upon his critical thinking, logic, etc!” than if I got a high GMAT score!\n\nAny thoughts about taking LSAT in place of the GMAT? Assuming math masters accepted the LSAT, would the LSAT be a better replacement for my situation?",

My task falls well outside my realm of interest and expertise, and funding will run out a few months before I’m supposed to graduate. It’s now a mad dash to complete something that works before the money runs out.   \n\nMy advisor has been nonexistent since I started grad school, despite being the only person that has the research background that fits my interests, and despite convincing me that this was the right school to study my topic of interest. I have some great grad student colleagues (and one prof) that I look to for support, but they study completely different fields. I’m finally starting to have ideas of my own, but I don’t know whether their scopes make sense or whether they’re thesis-worthy for my program.  \n\nShould I stick it out in the hopes that this project works, then desperately write a thesis in 2 months, or should I try to create something of my own? Is this even feasible?\n\nI left behind a well-paying career to return to grad school to pursue something I’m passionate about, only to be left feeling confused and exploited. I have nobody to blame but myself for choosing my program so poorly, and all I can do now is try to muster the willpower to push through to the end.",

I've been working on my MA (in History and Archives) for around 4.5 years now, my plan was originally to be done in 2-3 years. Roughly 2.5 of those years has been me working on my MA thesis and it has been a nightmare to complete. \n\nOver the last 2.5 years I've had several committee members change and drop from my committee over time. Most of them tried helping me when they could but eventually they said they didn't have time to commit to helping me (which I don't entirely believe but I have no proof so I have to take them at their word). To make things worse, around 4 months ago I had to completely change direction and essentially start over because myself and my committee head could not agree on what this paper was supposed to look like. He was so hands off with helping me and I didn't realize how much until after over a year into the project he says to me, \"This isn't grad level work, what you've made doesn't follow what we originally envisioned for your thesis.\" We got into a big argument over this and eventually agreed to restructure the entire thing.\n\nHe's still on my committee technically but he's delegated essentially all of his head duties to another member of the committee who, while he does mean well, had me restart the project from the ground up because he insisted a restart would let me be able to create new &amp; better grad level work. For the last few months I was trying to work with this new direction but it seems nothing I submit is up to their standards. I keep getting told, \"This isn't grad level work\" and when I ask them what is, they just tell me more historical analysis. I submit the historical analysis and they tell me it's not enough, rinse and repeat.\n\nI'm basically back where I started with no end in sight and I want to quit. The main thing stopping me from quitting is I'm very unlikely to get a job in history without a MA degree that isn't teaching and history is what I want to do (at least I think it is, truth be told I don't even know anymore). I know if I leave than it'll be even harder to get back in if I ever feel like I want to try again.\n\nI had two fainting episodes in one day which lead me to the hospital. After doing all their standard tests, they said I had nothing wrong with my physically. The doctor attributed it to stress and once I mentioned I'm doing my MA. It's affecting my mental health as well as physical now. I've asked other people in my life what I should do and their answers are a mix of \"it's your decision\" and \"you're so close to finishing, just tough it out!\" That second one I especially hate hearing, even when I tell them I had to start over they still trying saying I'm so close the end which doesn't make any sense to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR-** I had to start my thesis over after working on it for over a year because it \"wasn't grad level work.\" My committee chair has delegated all of his duties to another member of the committee who had me restart my project because the prior direction wasn't working in anyone's eyes. Starting over back at square one really has killed my morale for this project and I don't even know if I want to continue.",

There's got to be an easier way to get complex figures that already exist, right?",

Also, there is a portion where we write about our research interests. I have been citing the literature in this part, because how can you not? I am alluding to previous research areas in neuroscience and then suggesting areas I would like to work on, so it only makes sense that I would cite. I do not want to get in trouble for any sort of plagiarism on this. Does it seem odd to cite the literature in a personal statement? Also, is it bad that it is taking me over 1 month to write (also working full-time)? Any advice is appreciated :D ",

She is lovely, but a bit late to respond and also quite vague.\n\nI have previously mentioned that she advised me to do an analysis that would be way to broad for my MA thesis. I finally got hold of her, and upon explaining, she concluded that what she had said earlier would be too much. Yes, that’s what  had already told her in two emails plus what  had done so far proved it (I took her word for it an wrote a rough outline, to show her just how massive it would be). \n\nI have not had her during the coursework part of my time as a student. However I have a good relationship with another professor. I have had excellent results and she has often mentioned that she likes my contribution. The exams are all anonymous, so although my SV might have graded some of them, I don’t think she has put 2+2 together and known which ones are mine. However that would have been quite obvious for the prof I have had in class due to the content of my papers, writing style, etc.\n\nAnyway I wasn’t much wiser after our meeting although we moved ahead a bit. I honestly just don’t trust her advice. I’m sure she will be great once it comes down to working on theory and discussion (at least I hope), and I don’t want to cause drama and ask for a new advisor.\n\nI actually ran in to my old prof on the street and she seemed genuinely glad to see me (I live in a different town, she was visiting friends here). She also said she wished she was advising me, without me mentioning it first. She stressed that I should not hesitate to contact her if I needed help. “And I mean it! Anything at all!”\n\nI am now really in need of a second opinion. But I feel kind of like  I would going behind my SV’S back? What is the protocol for these things for those of you who work in academia? Is it rude or considered normal?\n\nThank you for reading!",

I have a feeling that they think they can do this because I disclosed early on that I'm neurodivergent. The entire fall term I've dealt with them treating me like I couldn't do the job (but in such a way that it would be difficult to prove) when in reality, I've taught in several university-level settings over the course of the last six years  (although this was my first term working as a GTA) and had quite a good rapport with the students. It feels like a 'poisoned atmosphere' working with this prof. \n\nAnyway, the term is almost finished, and I just sent a polite but direct email asking them not to use that type of behaviour (and I specified) toward me again, and also reminded them that I am a colleague (and asked for an apology but I don't see that happening). Regardless of how they deal with this, it's on the official email record at my university and I felt that I set professional boundaries with them. (I should mention that we are about the same age, so it wasn't even a case of me being much younger -- which of course, would also be completely inappropriate even if that were the case). \n\nLooking for feedback. It's been a stressful term. Thanks!",
