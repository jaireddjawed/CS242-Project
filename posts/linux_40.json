Inside it would be a collection of software including the host OS, configuration management, and storage services. There would be add on modules to expand functionality—for example https proxy and backups.\n\nI dream of this because I can see blog posts of lots of people hand rolling personal clusters. If there were cloud distros, just like Linux distros, we could choose to pick one and enjoy the relatively stable updates.\n\nDoes this exist? Does anyone else dream of this?",

        "text": "I shared a project I've been working on periodically on here a few months back, `hflow`. It's a http debugging proxy, written in Go.\n\nAt the time it only allowed you to view and filter http traffic. Despite this, a number of people used it, starred it and forked it; so I thought I'd share the updates that I've recently released with you. Especially as some were explicitly asked for on this sub, and similarly themed ones.\n\nhflow now supports the following features:\n\n* `Traffic Capture`: Capture all traffic or filter by request url and/or response status\n* `Edit &amp; Continue`: Break on requests and/or responses that match a specified url pattern and edit them before they are forwarded and/or returned\n* `Request Re-routing`: Route requests destined for one host to another, such as a local or test instance\n* `TLS Support`: Decrypt both HTTP and HTTPS traffic. Add HFLOW's root CA certificate into your client's certificate store for seamless HTTPS traffic interception\n* `Response Decoding`: Automatically decodes gzip and brotli encoded responses\n* `Flexible CLI`: Write captured traffic to stdout or to a named file, optionally omit binary data or truncate large payloads\n* `Comprehensive Documentation`: View a 'quick start' guide and detailed information on installation and advance usage in the [README](https://github.com/comradequinn/hflow#readme)\n\nI genuinely don't think there's anything like it currently available on Linux or macOS, for free, that is as solid, and now fully featured, as `hflow` is. It's been a lot of enjoyable, but sometimes hard, work and, frankly, I'm proud of it!\n\nThere's lots more information on the [README](https://github.com/comradequinn/hflow#readme) and the source code is available [here](https://github.com/comradequinn/hflow)\n\nThere's binaries available for various platforms [here](https://github.com/comradequinn/hflow/releases)\n\nI hope some of you find it as useful as I do :)",

        "text": " MPLS is a protocol for high-performance communication protocol. It directs data from one network node to the next based on short path labels rather than long network addresses, avoiding complex lookups in a routing table. It is basically switching packets. Thus, we can think about it as a protocol that is between the data link layer (layer 2) and the network layer (layer 3), because of that it is commonly thought as a layer 2.5 protocol.\n\nThe name of the protocol is composed of “Multi Protocol” because it can encapsulate packets from various protocols. Also, “Label Switching” due to the fact labels are used for switching. The paths (LSP==Label Switch Path) are not established hop-by-hop they are targeted at a particular source-destination pairs ([https://medium.com/@krisha.india/https-medium-com-vaishali-bhatt-what-is-mpls-6a98ce43fbe2](https://medium.com/@krisha.india/https-medium-com-vaishali-bhatt-what-is-mpls-6a98ce43fbe2)).\n\nWe can use MPLS to forward all kinds of network traffic, including IPv4 and IPv6, as well as native ATM, SONET and Ethernet frames. MPLS is used in different use cases such as: enterprise WANs (Wide Area Networks), Metro Ethernet networks, MPLS VPNs (Virtual Private Networks), QoS (Quality of Service), traffic engineering and more ([https://medium.com/@laurayu\\_653/mpls-network-how-does-it-work-e38d1d684201](https://medium.com/@laurayu_653/mpls-network-how-does-it-work-e38d1d684201)) .\n\nThe core component of an MPLS network is a LSR (Label Switching Router). An ingress LSR is labeling an incoming packet and the egress LSR strips the label and forwards the packet. An example of an MPLS network is shown in the diagram below. By the way, there are also intermediate LSRs (which are between the ingress and egress) that swap the label of the packet and forwards them to the next one.\n\nIf we want we can go over the relevant MPLS code in the Linux kernel ([https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.1/source/net/mpls](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.1/source/net/mpls)). The major one is the kernel mode responsible for the MPLS (Address Family in the socket lingo) support under Linux ([https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.1/source/net/mpls/af\\_mpls.c](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.1/source/net/mpls/af_mpls.c)),  which enables the configuration and management of MPLS networks (like VPNs and QoS as stated earlier). There are more that I am going to example about in a future post.\n\nFor more information about MPLS I suggest reading the following link [https://towardsdatascience.com/multiprotocol-label-switching-mpls-explained-aac04f3c6e94](https://towardsdatascience.com/multiprotocol-label-switching-mpls-explained-aac04f3c6e94).

        "text": "Greetings traveler,\n\njoin me at my campfire while I regale you with the tall tale of making an LTE modem work with Linux on my Thinkpad T14 Gen 2 AMD.\n\nSo here's the device:\n\n```bash\n# lspci\n[...]\n05:00.0 Unassigned class [ff00]: Quectel Wireless Solutions Co., Ltd. EM120R-GL LTE Modem\n```\n\nThe modem has 2 SIM Slots, one for eSIM and one for a physical SIM.\n\nIt defaults to the eSIM slot, and it refuses to work with `mmcli` to switch the slots\nlike this:\n\n```bash\n# mmcli -v -m 0 --set-primary-sim-slot=0\n```\n\nSo I figured out with intense googling that I had to switch the slot with:\n\n```bash\n# qmicli -d qrtr://0 --uim-sim-power-on=0\n```\n\nI've disable the SIM's PIN with:\n\n```bash\n# mmcli -v -m 0 --disable-pin --pin xxxx --sim 0\n```\n\nBefore attempting a connection with ModemManager/NetworkManager, it has to be FCC unlocked (see [MM's docs](https://mobile-broadband.pages.freedesktop.org/docs/modemmanager/fcc-unlock/)). \n\nGoogling this, I stumbled upon [this](https://gist.github.com/joar/416f37fe81558f5be0d5131018eb7f2a), an unlocking procedure using a lib from a snap package provided by Lenovo. That's not necessary on a new enough ModemManager, all you have to do is:\n\n```bash\n# ln -snf /usr/share/ModemManager/fcc-unlock.available.d/1eac:1001 /etc/ModemManager/fcc-unlock.d/\n```\n\nFinally, the modem makes a successful connection with my provider's data. ModemManager-GUI crashes once the modem is unlocked, but that's due to an incompatibility with NetworkManager. Deleting the NM plugin fixes the crash,\nbut removes NM integration:\n\n```bash\n# rm -f /usr/lib/modem-manager-gui/modules/libmodcm_nm09.so\n```\n\nThe connection drops after a few minutes. EVERY TIME. The Lenovo Forums tell me about a firmware update that would fix the issue.\n\nGreat, `fwupd` will take care of that I thought.\n\nNope:\n\n```bash\n# fwupdmgr get-updates\nDevices with no available firmware updates: \n • UEFI Device Firmware\n • UEFI Device Firmware\n • UEFI Device Firmware\n • UEFI Device Firmware\n • EM120R GL\n • Integrated Camera\n```\n\n*sigh* Further investigations shows that most users updated their drivers in Windows, installing the firmware update.\nThere's no Windows on my device. The device isn't USB, so I can't plug it into another device.\n\nQuectel does provide a firmware flasher [here](https://github.com/nippynetworks/qfirehose).\n\n```bash\n$ git clone https://github.com/nippynetworks/qfirehose\n$ cd qfirehose\n$ make\n```\n\nThe download Lenovo offers is a Windows Installer (*groan*)\n\n```bash\n$ innoextract nz7wj05w.exe\nExtracting \"1.0.0.30 (NZ7WJ05W)\" - setup data version 5.5.7 (unicode)\n - \"code$GetExtractPath$/Setup.bat\" - overwritten\n - \"code$GetExtractPath$/Setup.bat\"\n - \"code$GetExtractPath$/fw/firmware.zip\"\n - \"code$GetExtractPath$/fw/FWUpgradeTool_PCIe.exe\"\n - \"code$GetExtractPath$/fw/ImageInfo.xml\"\n - \"code$GetExtractPath$/fw/mbfwdriver.cat\"\n - \"code$GetExtractPath$/fw/QService.exe\"\n - \"code$GetExtractPath$/fw/QuectelFwUpdateDriver.dll\"\n - \"code$GetExtractPath$/fw/QuectelFwUpdateDriver.inf\"\n - \"code$GetExtractPath$/fw/WUProgressCtl.exe\"\n - \"code$GetExtractPath$/pcie/mhihost.cat\"\n - \"code$GetExtractPath$/pcie/MhiHost.inf\"\n - \"code$GetExtractPath$/pcie/ModemAuthService.exe\"\n - \"code$GetExtractPath$/pcie/qcude.cat\"\n - \"code$GetExtractPath$/pcie/qcude.inf\"\n - \"code$GetExtractPath$/pcie/mhi/amd64/MhiHost.sys\"\n - \"code$GetExtractPath$/pcie/qcude/amd64/qcude.sys\"\n - \"code$GetExtractPath$/usb/qcgnss.cat\"\n - \"code$GetExtractPath$/usb/qcgnss.inf\"\n - \"code$GetExtractPath$/usb/qcser.cat\"\n - \"code$GetExtractPath$/usb/qcser.inf\"\n - \"code$GetExtractPath$/usb/qmuxmdm.cat\"\n - \"code$GetExtractPath$/usb/QmuxMdm.inf\"\n - \"code$GetExtractPath$/usb/qusbccgp.cat\"\n - \"code$GetExtractPath$/usb/qusbccgp.inf\"\n - \"code$GetExtractPath$/usb/qcgnss/amd64/qcgnss.dll\"\n - \"code$GetExtractPath$/usb/qcmux/amd64/qcqmux.sys\"\n - \"code$GetExtractPath$/usb/qcmux/amd64/qcqmuxusb.sys\"\n - \"code$GetExtractPath$/usb/serial/amd64/qcusbser.sys\"\n$ unzip code\\$GetExtractPath\\$/fw/firmware.zip\n$ unzip EM120RGLAPR02A09M4G.zip -d A09\n```\n\nNow I have firmware and flasher, let's get this show on the road.\nThe firmware flasher complains about being unable to find the device. Huh?\nIt wants to flash USB devices. Checking the source code that it *indeed* supports PCIe, I find a reference to `/dev/mhi0` that doesn't exist on my system. WTF?\nMore googling reveals that Quectel has a USB driver this firmware flasher depends on.\n\nI acquired the zip file from a forum post from [Quectel's forum](https://forums.quectel.com/t/linux-pcie-drivers/13666).\n\nSo, let's use it... Of course it didn't compile on the latest available kernel, so I had to use the LTS kernel:\n\n```bash\n$ unzip Quectel_Linux_PCIE_MHI_Driver_V1.3.1.zip\n$ cd pci_mhi\n$ make KDIR=/lib/modules/5.15.82-1-lts/build\nmake ARCH=x86_64 CROSS_COMPILE= -C /lib/modules/5.15.82-1-lts/build M=/home/fuero/modem/pcie_mhi clean\nmake[1]: Entering directory '/usr/lib/modules/5.15.82-1-lts/build'\n  CLEAN   /home/fuero/modem/pcie_mhi/Module.symvers\nmake[1]: Leaving directory '/usr/lib/modules/5.15.82-1-lts/build'\nfind . -name *.o.ur-safe | xargs rm -f\nmake ARCH=x86_64 CROSS_COMPILE= -C /lib/modules/5.15.82-1-lts/build M=/home/fuero/modem/pcie_mhi modules\nmake[1]: Entering directory '/usr/lib/modules/5.15.82-1-lts/build'\n  CC [M]  /home/fuero/modem/pcie_mhi/core/mhi_init.o\n  CC [M]  /home/fuero/modem/pcie_mhi/core/mhi_main.o\n  CC [M]  /home/fuero/modem/pcie_mhi/core/mhi_pm.o\n  CC [M]  /home/fuero/modem/pcie_mhi/core/mhi_boot.o\n  CC [M]  /home/fuero/modem/pcie_mhi/core/mhi_dtr.o\n  CC [M]  /home/fuero/modem/pcie_mhi/controllers/mhi_qti.o\n  CC [M]  /home/fuero/modem/pcie_mhi/devices/mhi_uci.o\n  CC [M]  /home/fuero/modem/pcie_mhi/devices/mhi_netdev_quectel.o\n  LD [M]  /home/fuero/modem/pcie_mhi/pcie_mhi.o\n  MODPOST /home/fuero/modem/pcie_mhi/Module.symvers\n  CC [M]  /home/fuero/modem/pcie_mhi/pcie_mhi.mod.o\n  LD [M]  /home/fuero/modem/pcie_mhi/pcie_mhi.ko\n  BTF [M] /home/fuero/modem/pcie_mhi/pcie_mhi.ko\nmake[1]: Leaving directory '/usr/lib/modules/5.15.82-1-lts/build'\n```\n\nFine. Don't forget to blacklist all `mhi` modules the kernel ships before loading the module.\n\nAdd `/etc/modprobe.d/blacklist_mhi.conf` with the following content:\n\n```\nblacklist mhi\nblacklist mhi_ep\nblacklist mhi_net\nblacklist mhi_pci_generic\nblacklist mhi_wwan_ctrl\nblacklist mhi_wwan_mbim\n```\n\nRegenerate your initrd (in my case with `mkinitcpio -P`) and boot into the LTS kernel.\n\nNow `insmod` the newly minted driver:\n\n```bash\ninsmod ./pcie_mhi.ko\n```\n\nThen call the firmware flasher:\n\n```bash\n# ./QFirehose -p /dev/mhi_BHI -f ../A09\n```\n\nThe firmware's flashed successfully, and the modem performs as expected now.",

        "text": "I've administered Linux both professionally and personally in my home.  I enjoy trying to find FOSS options esp. for home use.  I like the implication of what FOSS brings to the table and supporting those efforts.  However even after 13-14 years of using Linux I still find installs outside of the standard package managers to be nearly always infuriating.  I truly don't understand why things have to be so complex and why prebuilt packages can't be the norm. i.e., windows exe or msi.  Why is the reliance on the consumer of the application to sift through the mountains of dependencies and their respective installs and out of date guides and install switches that nobody except for the maintainers of those tools seems to know about.  \n\nFor an example: I've recently been working on my home automation and capturing sensor data.  I have some wemos devices capture temp and humidity and then send that data to an MQTT broker (mosquito) and viewing that data in Node Red.  But I want to capture and report on this data long term.  So figure that's easy, just spool up grafana use the MQTT plugin pull the data store and graph it.   Getting the MQTT plugin is met with the usual frustrations of installing yarn, mage, go, nodejs, etc. then building the actual plugin.  Why?  It seems to always go down this path with everything I try to install.  Why wouldn't a developer of an application make the installation of this type of thing simple?  I would even take a .deb package (I'm on ubuntu server).  \n\nI like the idea of customization and I get that, I get that there are multiple distros and allowing building frees you from being locked to a distro/package manager.  What would be the harm in the Linux community agreeing on some type of standard installation method and sticking to it across the board?  Of coarse leaving the ability open for those who want/need to build their own.  I'm not a developer so maybe this is outside of what I'm capable of understanding from my perspective as a consumer of Linux and FOSS applications.  \n\nTo close this is just an attempt at venting (or whining).  I really want Linux to succeed and grow and I want to be able to more easily use it in my daily interactions.  But the wall to entry is high and I fear it runs off other potential adopters.  I know it makes myself not use certain tools because I get frustrated and give up.   \n\nFeel free to downvote and flame away, would prefer a discussion, but will take what i get.  But before you do be sure to install the appropriate dependencies...",

        "text": "I know I'm in the Linux subreddit here so it's like asking to get roasted. Let me preface this by saying I think ubuntu and linux overall is very nice to work with, IF all you need is the terminal in a server oriented environment. The moment GUI/day to day stuff enters the game it all falls apart.                  \n\n\n\nSo, I've been using linux for work for the past 2 years, specifically ubuntu and kubuntu (18.04, 20.04, 22.04). I do devOps and backend. Ubuntu has left me with nothing but frustration to the point where I switched to mac. I am too tired to learn another flavor and all it's options and quirks, so I cannot talk about other linux distros.                  \n\n  \n\n\nMy complaints are as follows:                    \n\n\\- Snap is a total piece of garbage, more annoying and ridiculous than anything microsoft ever did with windows. This auto-updating glorified 'program manager' has broken my environment and apps multiple times, leaving me scratching my head as wtf went wrong overnight. All of it without asking, without letting me know, without anything. Best you can do is purge it and install stuff manually even tho it's more bothersome.            \n\n\n\n\\- General auto-updates also broke some of my stuff (switched ubuntu to kubuntu without a clean install following a tutorial), purged gnome features and woke up 2 months later with gnome back on and half my stuff unusable (after a overnight update). But hey, those are rather easy to turn off, I just wish they were turned off by default. Feels kinda weird that the super customizable OS punished me for customizing my OS.           \n\n\n\n\\- There's random bloatware on the latest ubuntu versions, I don't need solitaire or minesweeper or whatever quirky program name that I don't remember and never used is.            \n\n\n\n\\- Apt-get is fine 99% of the time, but it did cause me confusion with having to add repositories with their gpg keys then being unable to apt-get update when those keys changed.                \n\n\n\nNext, the GUI: so I used both gnome and kubuntu and I hate both of them.       \n\n\n\n\\- In either, if you try to use the file manager and you have some files that your current user is not owner of, you'll either have to open a terminal and do your inputs from that / change ownership, or add plugins. JUST WHY. Give me a sudo input password  prompt and let me be done with it.      \n\n\\- Neither seem to have a solid design philosophy with some elements/menus having different interactions. Quirk of it being open source.              \n\n\\- Gnome just sucks for me, I don't like the way it looks or how it behaves with windows, or it having a different alt-tab behavior from windows/mac. It feels like it tries to be different for the sake of it, even if it's inferior.         \n\n\\- KDE is better, but it also has less support, so some of the tools/apps I use for work just bug out and have to be rebooted.          \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn the hardware side I am also rather disappointed. It's harder to find tools that monitor and change behavior (intel XTU, msi afterburner, hwinfo64). I have a chronic obsession with monitoring and tweaking my hardware. Yet, in ubuntu, most of the stuff I found is terminal based and rather ugly to work with.           \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've also had very weird issues with how ubuntu interacted with my thinkpad laptop. I've had the following:       \n\n\\- processor stuck at 0.8Ghz with any power management setting         \n\n\\- External monitor not getting recognized/ recognized with no image/ stuck in wrong resolution (lenovo monitor too). I don't even remember how I fixed it because it was such a flurry of anger and digging for different solutions on google.               \n\n\\- the laptop keyboard randomly not working, but only partially (n a u spacebar left/up arrow key), I installed some package that temporarily solved it but the issue would still reappear then disappear after a while. (it however doesn't happen with an external keyboard or a wireless one).            \n\n\\- stuff like DAC's straight up not having a linux driver, and your only hope is some wizard reverse engineering it on his whacky 10 year old linux version.            \n\n\\- wifi behavior being absolutely dumb to the point where I have an ethernet cable all the time, I just gave up on it.          \n\n\\- Its over customizability becomes a burden and its downfall because between 2 threads or 2 answers or 2 blogs that are a few months/years apart the recommendations are completely different or might not work with your specific setup.       \n\n\\- you either need to be a 'programming oriented' person or really adept at googling to be able to maintain ubuntu, if I somehow managed to get my less tech savvy relatives to try it, they'd probably stop talking to me for what I did to them.       \n\n\\- Very minor annoyance, kinda funny actually: why did it have to be ctrl+shift+v for terminal and ctrl+v for 99% of the GUI. I still accidentally open the browser console when trying to copy paste stuff.       \n\nOn a last note, I consider myself a chronic tweaker and a very advanced power user, and I'm fucking tired of ubuntu. I just want it to work, I spent so much energy on it and it keeps being a piece of shit. I'm done. I just want to do my 8 hours of work. There have been a lot of deadlines and this junk forced me to either power trough it's annoying behavior/bugs or fix it then crunch.        \n\n  \nAgain, I haven't tried other linux flavors myself, and I'm too exhausted to give another one a shot atm. In my opinion, the average schmuck is better off on a different distro or on a mac, heck windows with WSL2 seems to work fine. The time you spend having to customize and troubleshoot ubuntu is tenfold to what you spend on fixing/debloating windows or mac, and from what I've seen, it seems like a worse end result than if you started with another distro.         \n\nThanks for reading my rant.",

If you then create root / and /home on your SSD it will boot from the recognised drive and benefit from the SSD, but don't forget to point the bootloader at the BIOS-recognised drive during installation.
