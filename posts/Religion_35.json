Neuralink works directly on the brain and this brings into interesting perspective on our soul.\n\nInitially, this device will be used to help people with blindness, literally giving eyesight back to even blind people from birth, those who have spinal cord injuries, etc. Which I think is good as long as people take it voluntarily.\n\nBut, also comes a frightening possibility that in the future some government mandates this chip in your brain, which can theoretically control you like a remote-controlled robot.\n\nI mean we are human tech cyborgs in a way with our smartphones and whatnot. But Neuralink is on a whole different level. Even our innermost thoughts that we hold so private will be available to be viewed by those in control of these devices.",

For me it’s not a problem that we have different beliefs, but I suppose he does. He thinks that we will have a better relationship and that we will be more protected by God if I convert to his religion. But my heart says that I shouldn’t just convert to make someone else happy or to “make it work.” My decisions truly come from the heart! I can’t lie to him, but it seems to be a deal breaker because he’s not asking me to marry him or talking about marriage lately. I wonder if it’s really his beliefs or just pressure from those around him. And if I’m a good, honest woman shouldn’t that show more than someone who is simply willing to do anything to be married?

Over a thousand years later Christian pilgrims in America tried again to establish such system of distribution as found in Acts, and it failed again. I wonder if this later influenced the anti-socialist views of many American Christians even before the URSS was a thing, but I can only speculate.\n\nRegardless, so far it seems charity can be of great help for people in need even if it is debatable if it shall exist or it compensates for a state that failed its people. I wonder what the roots of Christian charity are based on, or if it grew organically on its own right.",

My parents wanted to give me the option to choose later in life and feel in charge of my own destiny or something like that instead of imparting their beliefs on me.\n\nFor most of my life I've wanted spirituality of some sort, but I was never sure where to go. The big problem I think is that, I honestly don't care *what* I believe, as long as I have a family to believe it *with.*\n\nI want to feel part of something bigger than myself and have people around me that feel the same way.\n\nThat does sound bad I think, but I do actually want spirituality in my life as its own concept. I just... don't really mind what I end up being taught.\n\nEverything I've tried to pursue doesn't work out for me because I just don't have anyone to practice with, no family or friends care or are particularly spiritual, I don't know where to start finding community since I live in the middle of nowhere. Online communities are fine, but trying to do anything with those beliefs in person just feels so lonely and I don't have anyone to guide me in how to do it right.\n\nI guess the more I write, the more I feel like it is a bad reason to seek religion.

This is obvious as often one partner may believe in God and another not, but the later may go to church just as company for the other, so it is not something new.\n\nHowever, it seems most churches I know make a distinction between a full membership. For instance, a person that is not a Christian cannot be a full member of a Christian church, a person who is not a Jew may not have a position in a Synagogue, etc. and that makes perfect sense.\n\nI wonder if other places of worship lack that distinction, though.",

But I read it and I was frightened:\n\"Famous Satanist Anton Lavey’s last words were “What did I do, what’s wrong”, detailing the last moments before his death. He is the founder of the First Church of Satan and the author of the Satanic Bible.\n\nAnton Lavey last words depicted that at the last moment, Anton was terrified to realize that he had let himself be deceived by the devil and is now facing eternal hell.\"\n\nIf there are any followers here, what's the hell you think you're doing?

        "text": "I'm Protestant but it seems we do not believe in original sin as we let baptism for teenagers instead for newborns, for example. Most Protestants also believe Babies are born with no sin, even when technically they do believe in it.\n\nHowever, it seems to be about semantics. Protestants call it Original Sin but it may be better called as \"Original capacity to sin\", and by itself is probably not a sin.\n\nJews and Muslims do not seem to believe in original sin, but do believe in ability of humans to do evil, but that is slightly different from actually doing evil.\n\nI also was reading Genesis and I find this verse very interesting, when God concluded that humans are naturally motivated to do evil by their own free will and that cannot be stopped while they are free:\n\n&gt;And GOD saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that **every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually**. - Genesis 6:5, KJV\n\nThat's sounds a lot like the original sin, but closer to the capacity to sin in the first place.\n\nWhat do your faith claims about sin (or equivalent concept) and human nature?",

We are talking about an indigenous demographic shrinking due to externally imposed secularizing efforts, something that is very close to cultural genocide, and atheism has so warped people's minds, that they believe that there is nothing wrong with celebrating demise of indigenous culture. \n\n**WARNING**: *I will not respond to anyone who repeats the lie that support of cultural genocide is not racism. I will not respond to anyone who pedantically \"corrects\" me that atheism didn't cause this cause atheism is just a lack of belief in God, and literally nothing else whatsoever.*",
