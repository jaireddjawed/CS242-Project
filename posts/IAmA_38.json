        "text": "Hi Reddit! We are HepNet, a coalition of agencies and organizations from Thunder Bay, Canada. \n\nJuly 28th is recognized annually as World Hepatitis Day, an international event with the goals of raising awareness about viral hepatitis and influencing action. We are holding the AMA today to commemorate the event this year. The goals of this AMA are to raise awareness, reduce stigma, encourage testing, and provide education on hepatitis C and associated risks, as well as to provide education on harm reduction. \n\nThere are currently 300 million people living with viral hepatitis who are unaware of their status. In Thunder Bay, approximately 1 in 50 people are living with Hepatitis C, and many are undiagnosed. These local rates are much higher than the provincial average. As Hep C often has mild or no symptoms at all, the only way to know for sure is to get tested. Understanding risk and practicing harm reduction have been proven to reduce the risk of transmission. \n\nWe are holding this AMA as a fun and exciting way to engage with the public and answer any questions you might have. \n\nWho we are: \n\nCynthia Olsen - Coordinator, Thunder Bay Drug Strategy\n\nRick Thompson - Superior Points Harm Reduction Program \n\nAaron Leiterman - Elevate NWO\n\nNickie Saczawa - Ontario Addiction Treatment Centres\n\nAmanda Haniak - Registered Practical Nurse, Liver Care Northwest\n\nLink to proof: https://www.facebook.com/elevatenwo/photos/a.174804982556718.31890.169997633037453/1728700000500534/?type=3&amp;theater\n\nEdit: Thanks for all of the questions! We will be taking a break for now but we will get back to answering questions on Monday. ",

My story [Inhuman Resources](https://highline.huffingtonpost.com/articles/en/hsbc-sexual-harassment-hr/) is about Mike Picarella, a 22-year Wall Street veteran exposed to the toxic workplace culture at HSBC, one of the world’s largest banks. He witnesses sexual harassment by his boss, a woman who would push a female subordinate to join her at a nearby bar nightly, offer her up to clients and executives, and then gossip about her sexual exploits to colleagues the next day. Mike decided to stand up for the woman being harassed, and that fateful decision ruined his life. I’ll be glad to answer any questions about this  story, or whatever you’d like to ask about!\n\nProof: [https://i.redd.it/3orbtqrzvwb11.jpg](https://i.redd.it/3orbtqrzvwb11.jpg)",

I co-founded the first Giraffe Blood Bank, which has helped collect plasma from many species to assist vulnerable animals in need of life support at zoos across the country. I’m also an adjunct assistant professor at The Ohio State University College of Veterinary Medicine and I travel all over the country speaking about preventive vet medicine and vet management.

        "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI am Ashley Steven. I run AcademicWinners.com, a company that writes custom college papers for students. I have been in this business for more than five years, and I have helped hundreds of graduates and undergraduates in their homework.\n\nI am excited to let you all know about this industry and its benefits.\n\nMain Site: r/https://academicwinners.com/\n\nHere are some common questions to get started:\n\n**Is this service legal?**\n\nAbsolutely. Our company follows all U.S. laws and regulations.\n\n**Is this service ethical?**\n\nEthics is an issue of principles, and thus its subjective. One thing for sure, our clients are principled and good people. In fact, some are very skillful and simply do not have enough time to complete their classwork and still provide for their families and themselves. \n\nOften, these students are middle aged people returning to school to meet arbitrary degree requirements, foreign students struggling in the U.S. education system, which unfortunately does not provide appropriate ESL assistance, or just students who need to complete an assignment that isn’t so much relevant to their degree. There are of course also the extreme cases, such as clients who have ordered papers because of family emergencies, being in the hospital, etc.\n\nOur clients generally transition into the workforce successful and seem to be mostly successful. Since our clients, employers, their families, and our company benefit from this relationship, there is no real ethical issue in my view.\n\n**What types of projects are completed?**\n\nWe cover almost all fields; however, our main specialties are in business, management, accounting, finance, economics, nursing, law, history, English, chemistry, physics, and engineering. \n\nWe also offer other services besides custom writing such as editing, re-writing, and proofreading. \n\n**What are your prices?**\n\nOur prices are publically available and they start from as low as $10. r/https://academicwinners.com/product/custom-order/\n\n**What I personally do?**\n\nWeb design and development\n\nConsult with clients/students. \n\nBilling clients and pay writers\n\nKeep records and manage the database\n\nWrite and solve any issue between the client and the company.\n\nBasically all tasks required for the company to operate.\n\n**Samples**\n\n[https://academicwinners.com/blogs-2/](https://academicwinners.com/blogs-2/)\n\n**Guarantees**\n\nRevision\n\n[https://academicwinners.com/our-revision-policy/](https://academicwinners.com/our-revision-policy/)\n\nPrivacy\n\n[https://academicwinners.com/privacy-policy/](https://academicwinners.com/privacy-policy/)\n\nPlagiarism-Free Guarantee\n\n[https://academicwinners.com/plagiarism-free-guarantee/](https://academicwinners.com/plagiarism-free-guarantee/)\n\nMoney Back Guarantee\n\n[https://academicwinners.com/guarantees/](https://academicwinners.com/guarantees/)",
