        "text": "It’s an hour until closing and business way slow. The thought crossed my mind that I would actually get to go home on time. Thus, cues several online orders. My manager and I are scrambling to get orders in the oven when the phone starts ringing. I have two deliveries that are near each other, but I really just wanted to go home. So, I answered thinking I could scare them off.\n\n“Thanks for calling Pizza Chain, my name is bitchstitch. Will this order be for delivery in an hour and a half or carryout in 20 minutes?”\n\n“An hour and a half?! Don’t you close in a half hour?”\n\n“Yes ma’am.”\n\n“Will I still get my pizza?”\n\n“Yeah, I’ll still bring it out. It’ll just be a while since I’m the only person here.”\n\nI’m trying my best to sound professional, but tired and stressed. But this woman has no pity for me.\n\n“Well, I’m going to need you to hurry because I want to go to bed soon.”\n\nME TOO, LADY. ME TOO.\n\n“I’ll try my best, but I can’t guarantee that I’ll be there sooner than the quoted time.”\n\nShe accepts my challenge to my dismay and thus starts a price check on everything we sell. After 10 minutes, she finally makes up her mind. Stupid me lets out a sigh of relief.\n\n“I’m sorry my order is such an inconvenience to you.”\n\n“No, ma’am. I’m sorry, I’m just tired. It’s not your fault.”\n\nShe gets off the phone. About 45 minutes later, her order is up. I drive to a more rural part of our delivery area to her street. It’s a main road, really dark, no lights are on, and I can’t see a single house number. So, I drive into each individual driveway until I find her house. House #3 is the winner. I get out and turn my phone flashlight on. The house is covered in ivy and weeds. Eventually, I found something that resembled a door and made my way to it.\n\n“Who’s out there shining lights in my window?!”\n\n“It’s Pizza Chain! It’s a little dark out and I didn’t want to trip.”\n\nShe comes outside in men’s boxers and a wife beater. She looks like she’s 60 years old. Her hair is a mess and I could very clearly see everything through her shirt. My area is a really nice suburb, so it really caught me off guard. I hand her the credit card receipts and she is taking forever to fill it out. She’s my last delivery, so I’m starting to get annoyed, but I have to keep myself together. I decided to make small talk. Big mistake.\n\n“You know why I dress like this?”\n\n“Because it’s comfortable?” \n\n“No, because I can do this!”\n\nShe opens up the hole on her men’s boxers. Stupid me was watching her, so I got an eyeful of old lady bush. She put her receipt in the hole.\n\n“Nifty, huh? It’s a nice little pocket.”\n\n“I never would have thought of using it like that. It’s certainly creative.”\n\n*WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY*",

I recently found out I'm at the outer edge of the delivery range of a Pizza Hut in a just slightly bigger town (through dumb luck I live right near the end of a tiny road that connects the two towns on the outskirts of mine and the middle of theirs). \n\nThis is extremely convenient. Those in more urban areas get spoiled I'm sure. Living here though it's amazing. We have two in town pizza places but neither deliver and Pizza Hut is comparatively priced. So when we found this out last week we ordered. We tipped $5 out of a $20 order. Today we ordered another $20 order and tipped $5. This comes out to slightly more food than ordering a sheet Pizza at the local place for $27 so I still save $2.\n\nIf you're a driver is $5 tip good for a 9 mile ride? Factor in there isn't much around here and chances of two deliveries on the route are probably small.",

What makes me mad is how earlier I deliver to a hospital and after telling the receptionist that I'm delivering a pizza to so-and-so on the whatever floor, they told me to wait in the lobby while they page them to come down. That's fine by me, if they're gonna stiff me they gotta come all the way down to me. But that wasn't the problem; problem was that it took at least 10 minutes for the nurse just to come down (keep in mind this is a small hospital) and she passed me at least 5 times after that. I didn't say anything then since I didn't know if she was the nurse I was looking for, but after the umpteenth time she passed me, only then did she say that the pizza was for her. Of course, she stiffs me.\n\nThose gosh darn hospitals. I wish they would just disappear. But I can't wish that because they're beneficial for our well-being. /rantover",

        "text": "A short rant/list of things that irritate me, as the CSR working over the phone.\n\n1. **Not knowing their address or phone number.** Approximately 20% of our delivery customers who call to place an order for delivery are *flummoxed* when I ask them for the address and have to embark on a search for mail with their address on it. How are there this many seemingly normal, functional adults who don't know their own address? I'd say a higher percentage don't know their phone number, although that's more forgivable since there isn't *as* much need to memorize it (since it's in your contacts list on your phone). \n\n2. **Playing telephone through the telephone.** If Jeb is the homeowner and you have to keep asking him for his phone number, address, toppings of choice, blood type, and payment information, why the hell are you placing the order and not Jeb?\n\n3. **Not having a clue what they want to order.** This specifically refers to people who call and it sounds like they're not quite sure how they ended up on the phone with a pizza place, much less what they want on their pizza. The worst is when it's for a group and deciding what to order becomes a group effort. No one expects you to know 100% what you want, and I don't mind helping you pick something out, but at least hash out the majority of the order with your friends before you call.\n\n4. **Becoming an unwilling participant in a game of 20 Questions.** This often goes with #3. \"What's the price of your large? Your medium? Your small? How many slices are there? Oh, they all have the same amount of slices? So the only difference is the size? How many toppings can I get? What sides you you have? Do you have any combos with [item]? Can you list all 18 toppings and provide the pros and cons and nutritional information of each one?\" All the while, I have other calls on hold and the label machine is vomiting tickets like it's got a hangover. It's 2016; you can answer almost all of those questions (and probably more quickly too) by looking up our menu using the very phone you're using to call me from. \n\n5. **Calling to place an order over the phone while actively browsing the website.** The least offensive one on the list, but this is just laziness, people!\n\nI'm just asking customers who order over the phone to please be mindful of the fact that we are constantly moving inside the store and you are probably not the only customer waiting to be helped, particularly if we have a sale and/or you're calling during peak hours. When we're waiting for you to find a piece of paper with your address, search for your credit card, debate with your family over what to get, or answer a hundred questions, those minutes add up over the course of multiple customers and that's time that could have been spent working on other things in-store or even making your pizza. So it's not just inconveniencing the employee on the phone, it slows things down for everyone. \n\n(Bonus: Having to call a customer because the delivery man is waiting outside and they're not answering his calls, the customer picks up my call almost immediately and I inform them the delivery man there, and they say \"Oh, I saw the call but I didn't answer because I didn't recognize the number\". You are the worst. The worst!)",

        "text": "On mobile so sorry for the poor formatting. \n\nI work at a local kebab shop that does pizza as well as a delivery driver. I am normally pretty good with finding people's houses, however about a week ago this happened. \n\nIn the shop on a crazy Friday night where I have been non-stop delivering I get back to the shop in time to hear my co-worker (CW) get a phone call. \n\n\nCW: (Store name) how may I help you?\n\nCW: was that the delivery to (address)?\n\nCW: yes we have been very busy tonight and I'm sorry it's taken so long, it is coming out of the oven now and won't be too much longer. \n\n\nHe then proceeds to hang up on her and I ask her what happened. She tells me that he was being very rude about his order screaming at her that he had ordered over an hour and a half ago and that this is absolutely ridiculous, I had a look at the ticket and saw that it was only about an hour and ten minutes which is more than fair enough on a busy night. So I pack up his one pizza and headed off. \n\nI punch the address, it was number 84 Street name Suburb (this will be important later), into my GPS and head off, luckily his house is only about 3 or 4 minutes away. Once I get to where my gps is telling me, I have a look around and only see bushes (I live in a rural area) so I back up a bit and see that the closest house is number 81, so I drive forward and see that the next house is 88. As you can imagine I was quite confused so rather than just trying to find a house that didn't seem to exist I decided to call the guy to ask for directions. This exchange took place, I'll be M and he'll be GG (grumpy guy):\n\nM: Hi this is Rebirth_Revival from (shop name) how are you going mate?\n\nGG: Just fucking fantastic. \n\nM: I'm just having a little trouble finding your house mate, I was wondering if you could give me a hand. \n\nGG: You're fucking kidding me.\n\nM: I'm not mate. \n\nGG: I'm the house with the grey gravel driveway. \n\nM: Well I'm down at number 81 and I can't find your house from here, the next house is number 88. \n\nGG: *sighs* Just go 3 houses up from you mate. \n\nM: Well I'll have another look but I can't see your driveway. \n\nI drive up to number 88 again\n\nM: Yeah I'm sorry mate but the next house is number 88. \n\nGG: look this is fucking ridiculous mate, I ordered over an hour and a half ago. \n\nM: yeah I'm really sorry mate. \n\nGG: you're looking for 84 (street name) right?\n\nM: yeah 84 (street name) (suburb)\n\nGG: oh for fuck sake mate, 84 (street name) (suburb next to the one I'm in)\n\nLuckily the street I'm on actually just continues form suburb to suburb so he is barely a minute away from me. \n\nM: I'm so sorry about that mate, they have given me the wrong address on my ticket. \n\nGG: look I know it's not your fault mate but this is fucking ridiculous, I ordered from you over and hour and a half ago, the girl in the shop just laughed at me and told me to wait.\n\nM: I'm really sorry mate, I'll be down with you in a minute. \n\nGG: *sighs heavily* yep\n\n\nI then haul my sweet cheeks to this guys house as quick as I can in an attempt to not piss him off even more. \nWhen I get there he is waiting at his front gate for me, and doesn't say a word when I give him the whole \"I'm so sorry about this\" rant. I hand him the pizza and he gives me some money and this follows:\n\nGG: Give your boss that, he'll understand. *hands me a $20 note*. \n\n(I think \"great, at least he's paying me.\")\nI look down at my ticket and see that the total was $22, by the time I look up he had basically sprinted back to his front door. \n\nM: The total was actually $22 mate\n\nGG: *without even turning around* I know. \n\nAnd he slams his door. \n\nI wasn't really sure what to do. So I wrote down what happened on the ticket so when my boss checked it at the end of the night he would see why I'm short $2. \n\nIt's just very unjustified behaviour from a grown adult. Firstly to way overstate how long it had been since he had ordered, treat me like garbage on the phone when I'm trying to find his house, and not pay me enough. \n\nLuckily my boss was understanding and let it go but it still frustrates me today. \n\n\nEdit: I just remembered this as well, so about a week after this happened I was on my way to the train station and almost got run over trying to cross the road. Later that night at work I had to go back to that house, the guy answered the door and seemed all fine and wasn't grumpy this time but then he apologised for almost running me over that same morning, turns out he's a shit driver too. Small world. ",

        "author": "theprophet84",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromThePizzaGuy/comments/57w02f/tips_to_help_boost_your_tips/",
        "text": "I delivered pizzas while I was in college after I got out of the Air Force. I pride myself on having been a kick ass delivery driver for Pizza Hut. Here is a brain dump of ways that I helped bolster my tips. I thought I'd put it somewhere since I don't need any of this information in my brain anymore.\n\n\n1. Never give silver change. No matter what. If they argue just say, \"I'm sorry it is store policy we don't give coin change\". If you say this with a slightly demeaning tone they'll drop the subject. Most people won't call the store and if they don't tp they are normally to lazy to bother calling the store. Offer them the chance to come back to the store and get there \"silver change\" if they like.\n\n2. Be extremely polite at the door try and make them like you in the first 5 seconds of meeting them.\nSay, \"I'm sorry it took so long\" when they open the door. Even if it was 15 min since they ordered. It will make them remember how fast it was.\n\n3. Never forget anything ever. Keep your car trunk stocked with two of each soda so you never forget one and have to go back. Replace the soda each time with one from the store. If you are still short on soda buy it from the store nearby and add it to your private trunk stock when you get back to the store. Return trips mean no tips.\n\n4. Keep all the parmesan, peppers, and sauces in your car. If someone doesn't tip you and they still want sauce or an extra say that the store charges for it. Tell them the price and pocket the cost. Free sauce and peppers for tippers.\n\n5. When people don't tip and you were on time and polit they are violating a social contract. Let them subtly understand your disappointment by violating another social contract; just stand on their door step and kind of blankly look at them as though your waiting for something. I call this \"the bell hop\". If they aren't going to tip they'll say, \"Is that it?\" or \"Ok... Have a nice day.\" and start to close the door. Smile with half your mouth in a smirk and give them an \"mmmhmm\" not bitchy sounding but just let them know they disappointed you. Don't say \"Bye\" or \"Have a nice day\" which might be reflexive. Stick to your guns. Keeps watching for social cues and stay vigilant. They'll crack eventually.\n\n6. This one I call \"the ringer\". Before you ring or knock take the pizzas out of the bag and have it all ready to hand to them squeeze the boxes with your hand it kicks out a little bit of the pizza smell. When they smell the pizza it makes them happy. I know it sounds crazy but it makes them more likely to tip.\n\n7. If someone is a known non-tipper don't wait for them. If it is one of those pretentious apartment complexes that makes you buzz in etc. make them come to the gate or door. Get them to come faster by saying that you're already here 5 min before you get there. If you say you're 5 min out they'll wait 5 min then come. Don't waste time with non-tippers.\n\n8. Memorize your delivery area map. If you need GPS you're doing it wrong. Learn the shortcuts and how to avoid traffic.\n\n9. Transfer stores to an area with rich neighborhoods. They tip better it's just how people are.\n\n10. Take as many runs at one time as you can. Going back to the store is death. This is a volume game.\n\n11. If you have a super late delivery take it last not first. People after them will be willing to tip better for early delivery. The late delivery is unlikely to tip anyway. Or sometimes I would flip the stack and deliver the newest pizza first and so one. Better chance of a tip on an early pizza than a late one. If they weren't going to tip at 1.5 hours they can wait another 15 min.\n\n12. Memorize your tippers and regulars so you know which runs to take and not take.\n\n13. Buy a set of tools and do your own car repairs it is easier than you think and there are plenty of resources to learn. Buy used tires because they're going to get fucked anyway. Have non-sidewall punctures patched.\n\n14. Make sure your car looks presentable on the outside. No damage from wrecks. Cops will pull you over in nice neighborhoods for no reason if your car looks fucked up.\n\n15. Never expect a tip from elderly or disabled. Help them and be courteous out of the kindness of your heart. They are on fixed incomes and they really don't have money to tip.\n\n16. Try and concentrate your deliveries so that they are on the way to one another or clustered. Once you memorized your delivery area you should be able to do this by sight.\n\n17. Learn the gate codes to all the apartment complexes. Learn the numbering scheme for all your complexes. ##00000099#* is the Konami code for 50% of the apartment gates.\n\n18. Tell your dispatcher what is what. They are stuck inside making $8 an hour and have no idea where any of these places are.\n\n19. If your boss asks you to run an errand for him tell him you need to be paid for \"a run\" for that. Gas ain't free and neither is your time at $6 an hour.\n20. Separate your money from tips each night for your bills, gas, and car maintenance. It is easy to blow the money from a big night and struggle to pay your rent.\n\n21. Work on Halloween. It is the biggest night of the year. The only comparable night is Super Bowl. Dont't work holidays that involve out door grilling. Don't work Sundays otherwise if you can avoid it.\n\n22. Remember your pen. If you don't have a pen and you make the person search for one you aren't getting tipped on credit cards.\n\n23. Memorize non-tippers and tell the dispatcher which deliveries you want. If you can avoid it do it. A lot of non-tippers order regularly so they're easy to spot.\n\n24. This one is just for fun. If you want a pizza at the end of the night and you have a dick manager that won't let you just make one; call in a fake carryout order. Unless you have the special kind of dick manager that throws out perfectly good pizza. Then you're fucked you should switch stores anyway because you probably aren't making much money there anyway.\n\nVolume, memorization, verbal judo, and social cues are the name of the game.\n\nThat's about it. Luckily, I got an education and was able to escape the hell hole of smelling like beer yeast everyday. I hope this helps you increase your tips.\n",

And a guy comes in and I'm ready to start training him on what to do for a customer as well, So I go through the usual introductions of taking an order (Welcome, can I get your phone number, etc etc etc) And the guy pulls out his customer appreciation card. Tick Tick Tick. With these cards you get nine stamps and the next pizza is free. Now, we normally write void on the card to show that it has been used and we put it in a little white basket on the counter and move about our day. \n\nHe must have seen one there a previous night and seen all the stamps were used so he just took it and tried to use it. \nSo he pulls out his card and I; just starting out; didn't know that the tenth stamp meant it was used. So I started scratching my head, why would someone punch the free space? And just as I was going to give him the free pizza, meltdown time. I did not cut the right wire. \n\nThankfully, there were no customers in-store at the time. I will always remember what he said that day too. \n\"How dare you! You're gonna harass me about my fucking card? A FUCKING CARD? What a fucking pathetic excuse for an employee you are! I'M GONNA TALK TO FUCKING CORPORATE ABOUT THIS! I'M GONNA HAVE YOUR ASS FIRED AND YOUR MANAGER'S ASS FIRED FOR HIRING A FUCKING SHITTY ASS EMPLOYEE LIKE YOURSELF.\" \nNow at this point I was just stunned. I'm not a very 'macho' man. I'm frozen in fear of this grown ass man running around my store on my shift calling me out for a card. He tells me to kill myself and then kicks my door open and leaves. Although in the end, no one from corporate ever heard a peep about this and only me, the new guy (who has since then left), and my manager know about this incident.\n\n\nThe worst part is, he still comes in and I actively avoid talking to him at any cost. There's a chance I've talked to him on the phone but other than that I have always hid behind the oven when I see him. \n\nSo tl;dr: \nI was starting out\nGuy comes in ready2scam\nI unknowingly question his scam\nHe blows up\nEverything is fine two minutes later.\nThe end",

Last Thursday, I went out for my last delivery of the night to an apartment complex about 5 minutes away. I thought \"this is great, not far away and it should be my last order before I can go home.\" I roll up to the apartments and eventually find the lobby for the right building address. First problem then presents itself. I cannot get into the main lobby as the person who ordered did not provide the code to get in. Even if I could, they also failed to give a room #. No problem, I'll call the person and ask them to come down to the lobby to get their food/let me in. I then called the customers number and no one answers. Three minutes later I call again, and still no answer. In total, I have been at this place for 20 minutes now, and the pizza place I work for is about to close in 10. Another 3-5 minutes goes by and I call again, this time leaving a voicemail. It became time to call the pizza place and tell my manager about the situation. The pizza place cannot get ahold of these people either, but tell me to wait a few more minutes as they try. At this point, it has been about 35 minutes since I got to the place, and I'm becoming really annoyed. Five more minutes go by, and my manager calls me telling me the person is now at the lobby waiting for me. I go to the lobby and the man says simply, \"sorry bud, we missed your calls because the phone was on vibrate.\" It took me almost an hour from when I left to get back from something that should've taken 15 minutes MAX.

        "text": "This happened a few weeks ago but I'm still processing all the bullshit. It was busy as hell, Sunday night football game, and we were understaffed in pretty much every position, we had been quoting 1.5 hrs for delivery time for a good chunk of the dinner rush. \n\nMy manager approached me with a visible headache, I thought she might be on the verge of a breakdown. She pulled me aside and said, \"darkxrick, this order needs to go out first. They're pissed as fuck and I've already comped their entire order, so just put on your prettiest smile and suffer through, ok?\"\n\nOh god.\n\nSo I show up to this very fancy house in a rich neighborhood with a large, 2 mediums, 3 smalls (one of them gluten free), and several appetizers. All of it fresh out of the oven, and completely free. Easily over $100 worth of food.\n\nThis old ass mother fucker opens the door and immediately goes on a bullshit rant. \"WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR AN HOUR FOR OUR FOOD, THIS IS COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE! DO YOU EXPECT ME TO TIP YOU, YOU LAZY SON OF A BITCH?!\"\n\n*engage my best shit-eating grin*\n\"Well sir, I understand your frustration. However, we have been quoting an hour and a half delivery times, due to the rush of orders for the game. Luckily for you, we've comped your order so tonight, your entire order is on the house. As far as tipping goes, that is up to you. I had nothing to do with your order being delayed, when I got to the store my manager handed me your food and I hit the road immediately. There's no requirement for tipping, but I did just bring you over $100 of free food, and gas is not free.\"\n\n\"Oh, you've got some mouth on ya kid. I SHOULD HAVE YOU FIRED FOR THAT! DISRESPECTFUL SON OF A BITCH! WHY WOULD I TIP YOU FOR SUCH HORRIBLE SERVICE?! I'M CALLING YOUR MANAGER FIRST THING WHEN YOU LEAVE! WE'RE NEVER ORDERING FROM *darkxrick's tasty pie* AGAIN!!\"\n\n\"Sorry about that. Enjoy your FREE food!\"\n\nI hate everyone. Their shit wasn't even late based on our quoted delivery time. Entitled ass people can't process the idea that not only does it take time to cook and package a huge order, but there were at least 40 other delivery orders ahead of theirs when they called. I still think my manager shouldn't have comped their order, she had every right to refuse, but our management will bend over backwards to make even the shittiest person happy.",

I worked in a mom and pop shop in a coastal town that sold really great, but kinda pricey, pizza. So I get this order on a Thursday night about two miles out in a nice neighborhood.\n\nI get to the house and this guy is standing out front, grimacing, with his arms crossed. He stares at me the entire time as I walk up to him.\n\n\"Hey how you doing, sir?\"\n\n\"How much?\"\n\n\"Total's 23.65, and I got change if y-\"\n\n\"What? 24.00 bucks for one pizza are you fucking kidding me?\"\n\n\"Whoa, you can look at the receipt if-\"\n\n\"Fuck the receipt, are you fucking scamming me?!\"\n\nAnd then he hands me the money anyways\n\nSo I'm all adrenaline pumping and half pissed off now, and I decide this unnecessarily hostile man no longer deserves respectful pronouns.\n\n\"Look, man. If you got a problem with the order, call the store. I'm just the driver.\"\n\n\"*You* call the store!\"\n\n\"It's not my pizza, man. Just take your change.\"\n\n\"No you wait right here!\"\n\nSo I'm standing there with his fucking pizza, as he storms back inside to yell at his wife about this pizza, and he comes back out and he comes back and takes his pizza and goes:\n\n\"Just give me my fucking change.\"\n\nSo I start getting his change out and was like: \"here you go\"\n\n\"I'm not fucking taking that, I'm not fucking paying for that. \n\n\"I don't know what you want, dude! Learn to control yourself!\"\n\n\"Don't call me dude! Get the fuck out of here! Fuck you!\n\n\"Lick my baaaaaalls!\"\n\nAnd so I leave, with his two 20 dollar bills, because fuck that guy. I drive back to the store and the GM starts laughing as soon as she sees me. Apparently he was so pissed off that I called him dude he completely forgot about his previous hang ups with the money. He said they wanted them to take my job and my drivers license?\n\nSo I'm thinking this dudes wife ordered this pizza with all these toppings on it because she hates him, and he was already pissed off at her because she hid his bipolar medication so he's determined to be in a shit mood and was hoping he could just throw a tantrum at me to get something, anything, that he wanted in his cold, miserable life. \n\nIdk imo you should say something when they tell you the fucking price or maybe ask the person who ordered it or idk maybe look at the fucking receipt and see that your dickshit fuckmuncher ass ordered a salad and a soda. \n\nAnyways that's how I got to tell this grey angry dude to lick my balls. \n\nEdit; thanks for the love, guys. I would reply to some of you but I'm super lazy and stoned. \n\nYes I told him to lick my balls because when I'm being yelled at words just start coming of of my face. \n\nHe ordered a dickton of toppings, a salad, and a soda. So 24 bucks is pretty reasonable where I live. \n\nEdit 2: , Shawn. ",

        "text": "Well, apparently the pizza guy always gets blamed and some customers think the world revolves around only them. Had this sort of experience today. \n\nDelivery times were 1.5 to 2 hours today right as I clocked in. We got swarmed with about ten orders (rare for us during an opening shift) \n\nMy problem was the I had to take 3 different orders to three different corners of town, in a triangular pattern. Always take the order by the promised time. \n\nGot stiffed on the first trip. Still arrived on time for that trip. But the first trip is what made everything so delayed took about a half hour to get there. After first trip, traffic sucked horribly - everyone doing ten under the limit despite sunny conditions and dry roads. This also contributed to me being late for the last delivery. \n\nMy second delivery I was able to find with some difficulty. Found the address. Finding the guys was another question. Painters. Found them hiding out behind the apartment complex. Tipped about $3 not bad. That's my average trip. \n\nLast delivery. Take the highway yet again to another far corner of town. To Flyer's HQ. Lady was grumpy and yanked everything out of my hands. Shot her an irritated look but said nothing except have a nice day. At least she still tipped $2. \n\nI put 75 ETA from time out of store to time back in. I made it with 4 minutes to spare. \n\nI get being upset but I am perplexed as to how someone so rude could work for another company. They also took their time in getting to me I assume payback for being late. But there are orders that come in and the way things work is that we do orders by the ETA time on the receit. If you order a timed order and we have another order for now and before you on the opposite side of town, the opposite side gets priority. \n\nSometimes our computers screw up and give customer and earlier delivery time estimate than the actual delivery time. \n\nIt was an okay day and considering there wasn't any extra work to be done at the end of my shift, I think it was an okay day. \n\nI should also note that if I'm late for any reason that I will make sure to call the customer once I have finished with the delivery for the one before them to let them know and explain the reason. \n\nShe got a refund and the only reason was \"for being late.\" \n\nI wasn't in trouble and thankfully I wasn't the only driver that day to have this happen to them. \n\nBut I think it might be time to expand the franchise and open new stores in my city. We're a single store that covers the size of what three others do in a city about the same size further down the hill. \n\nAnyone else ever on deliveries for an insane amount of time?",

        "text": "Hey guys,\nI lurk here occasionally and I thought this would be the perfect place to get perspective on this issue. I'm not looking to justify my own opinion as much as get an idea of whether I am being unreasonable or not. On to the issue.\n\nOne of my local pizza places I really enjoy recently made it so that you can no longer leave a tip on a delivery order if you pay with a credit card. Like pretty much every other delivery place or any restaurant I have ever been to, there used to be a separate line on the receipt in which you can fill in your own tip. I live in the U.S. and I normally tip the driver $5 because I think that's a pretty good tip and I feel it's worth it for the benefit of not having to go drive and pick it up. Anyway, this pizza place no longer allows it. You have to tip in cash.\n\nI'm in my 20's and I don't use cash for anything anymore. I use my card for everything. Online purchases, in-person purchases, etc. Most people that I know of my age are the same. The ATM's in the area that I live charge convenience fees to withdraw money. If I were to do this, I'd be charged a convenience fee as well as having to go out of my way in order to withdraw the cash, which I feel kind of defeats the purpose of delivery in the first place. \n\nSo my question, am I in the wrong for not tipping when I have ordered delivery from this place? I would be more than happy to tip if they still allowed me to use my card. When I order from other places, that's what I do. I feel it's the businesses fault that they put this policy into place and I don't feel it's fair that I need to take on the burden (and cost, in the form of ATM convenience fees) for their business decision. I think it sucks for the drivers and the employees who get paid on tips.\n\nThanks for reading. Please let me know your opinion.",

Then I get a bag of drinks but the person behind the counter forgets to give me any kind of receipt. Nothing in the bag of drinks or taped/stapled anywhere.  I didn't even realize this until I was at the location. I deliver anyway.\n\nDispatch tells me I have to go back to the restaurant and get the receipt **after** my shift, on my time and more of my gas. I parked at an expired meter with delivery bags everywhere in the car and flashers going for *literally* two minutes (I'm not kidding, I was in and out in under two) and I get a $20 ticket.\n\nI'm pretty heated about it, as I feel like I should not have been back at this place at all.

        "text": "I have had several dash cam's over the course of the last few years and just recently started to deliver pizza. Got hired despite having multiple accidents since June. The reason? A dash cam. With the dash cam I was able to prove that I was not at fault for any of the accidents and have been cleared of any liability. Here are a few tips. \n\nMake sure to place the cam so that it's either hidden near the rear view mirror or in a space five inches below it, or built into the rear view mirror. \n\nLook for always on battery packs to run the cam. Some of these cameras can stay on while you're parked (depending on the battery type of your car) without draining the battery all the way. \n\nIn my experience, the G1W is the way to go for a cam. It comes with a big screen and can playback files (useful if the police need evidence when filing a report or a customer complains about your driving) you can show your boss the footage also. \n\nThe one drawback is how big and obvious the camera is. If someone was looking for it, they would be able to see it. \n\nThe $17 Amazon \"potato cam.\" Not very great quality and the battery doesn't even last a week or two before giving out. Avoid like the plague. \n\nKingmak Original G1W. The one I got was a fake on Amazon and wouldn't read any SD Card that I formatted. Of course this could be a one time thing. But fakes do exist so be warned. \n\nUniden DCam. Best Buy has this small, nearly 1080P cam for $69.99 in store. It came with an 8GB micro SD memory card, good for roughly 15 minutes of video time. Purchased a 32gb card. 32GB seems to be good for about 1-2.5 hours of video. The cam is also small, but has playback and easily hidden near the rear view mirror. 4.5 stars. Also, if you turn the cam off, then back on after parking, it stays on for ten minutes then shuts down. \n\nIf you're looking for a dash cam with good quality, look for a G1W on Ebay. If you want something now and with almost 1080p quality, but are willing to spend a bit more, get the Uniden DCam. \n\nEdit: Meant to write \"want\" not wanted in the title. Dang phone. ",

        "text": "I do deliveries for Papa Johns (No big surprise there, aye?) and today I probably had one of the trippiest deliveries I've had yet. \n\n\nSeemed regular, get to the house. Nice little suburban area. Cul-de-sac even. Get out of my car, and head for the door. \n\n\nTry to use the doorbell, and the weirdness has started. It ... doesn't seem to be connected. To anything. The button compresses; you don't hear the doorbell, and it also slides around as if only the top is screwed in properly. No problem, I'll knock. \n\n\nI turn around, and literally, I see 5 people. This wouldn't be weird except for the fact that I -literally saw no one- while driving up. But here they were, playing basketball. Maybe I'm just going crazy and I didn't remember seeing them. Though, as I turned around, I can see one person running from the side of my car (Or perhaps from the side of the house I was at? View was partially-obstructed.)\n\n\nIt's whatever. I don't keep anything of value in my car. I mean maybe some loose change in case I have a cash delivery. But otherwise, nothing of value. My phone and wallet are already with me, and right now, my bigger concern was the fact that no one was answering this delivery. \n\n\nI start walking back towards my car, pulling out my phone and the delivery slip to give them a call, and the people at the road are calling out to me- asking if I have change. \n\n\nChange? I try to understand but hesitate a little; I don't wanna make a habit of announcing how much I carry on hand. I sort of play the role and just try to call back to them, trying to figure out what they're saying. \n\n\nAnd... they stop responding. I'm a bit surprised, but... if they're not gonna pursue it, it's whatever. At this point, they decide to approach me. As a group. Five people. Don't look very old by a glance, wouldn't put them as being older than 23. Either way, as I'm at my car, they've by this point surrounded me. \n\n\nOne of them informs me that the pizza is for them. I smile, and say \"Oh!\" and apologize for the trouble. He quickly asks if he can see the pizza, so I pull it out of the bag, and offer to open them up to show him.\n\n\nAnd he... walks away? I blink, rather surprised. Another person starts talking to me, asking what the price on the pizza was. \n\n\n$25.00. There's an odd moment of hesitation. He says he doesn't have enough cash - that's why they were away, their friend was checking their house for cash. \n\n\nWell, not a problem. I offer to call my manager and just see if we can remove one of the pizzas, and give them two of them. But he seems hung up on this fact he doesn't have cash, saying so multiple times. He starts asking me more personal questions - what time do we close at for deliveries? Can they just cancel this one and do another one later tonight? \n\n\nEither way, I smile and just say I'll give a ring to my manager, and I'm happy to do whatever he'd like to do, offering a second time to try and drop one of the pizzas (And take it back with me.) \n\n\nGet my manager on the line, she asks how much they have on hand so we can make sure it works, I call out (as they've now walked away while calling) to ask how much they have on hand, and he tells me to cancel the order. \n\n\nUhm... Ok. No problem :o Have a great day. \n\n\nI get back to the place letting the scenes play out in my head again. I can't help that gut feeling I had when I had 5 people surrounding me being something bad. I laugh it off, and I let my boss know the odd occurrence, and I just warn her in advance that they were talking about possibly ordering later that night (And making sure to be careful with it.) \n\n\nAt the end of the day I can't tell if I almost got mugged and by some grace they decided against it (I feel like being a guy like myself - not exactly in the top of physical shape but a rather intimidating build of 5'11'' and having wide shoulders) or maybe they just like my bubbly-happy personality I always seem to interact with people in.

What kind of pizza place is this?\"\n\nShe then looks at me as if I'm hiding them somewhere and I just back up shift lead \"Sorry ma'am like he said we don't carry any cutlery like that\"\n\nHer: \"Well I've never! *holy shit I've never heard someone say this in the wild* Well how do you expect me to eat this!?\"\n\nSL: \"I'm sorry we really don't know how to help you there\"\n\nHer: \"Well I'm filling a complaint, where's your suggestions box?\"\n\nSL: \"I'm sorry we don't have one\"\n\nHer: *Disgusted sigh* \"Well I'm definitely putting in a complaint, how am I supposed to eat this?\"\n\nAfter another round of sorrys she finally left but me and Shift lead still weren't sure what just happened.\n\nShe ordered a pizza and wings.\nAll we sell is pizza, wings, and cheesesticks.",

        "text": "Alright this is an old story as it happened when I was a teenager. So I was working for this pizza place under the table and would get a flat rate of $4 a delivery regardless of where I went (small town) so it was a pretty sweet deal. I lived near the place so I would normally just stay at home until an order would come in and then bop over and go deliver. \n\nThis one night however I had a huge test the next day and I asked my boss if I could study. As there was a place for employees he said it was no problem and let me just camp out there for the evening shift. \n\nThere weren't many deliveries happening and it was turning into freezing rain outside. My boss decided to go home and leave this dipshit in charge. This is the type of guy that you know this is as far as he will ever go in life. He's rude to customers. It's not that he 'forgets' to fill their drinks but he laughs and makes a joke about how long it will take 'those old bitches' to want the water bad enough to come up and ask for it. This was the kind of dick who was working that shift.\n\nThe restaurant closes at 11:00 pm every night and that hadn't changed for the 5 months I was there. It was about 9:00 pm and all night this guy had been incessantly interrupting me and flirting and asking if I was single (He was in his 30s. I was a teenager). \n\nI decide to just cruise around for a bit and come back because I swear at this point I'm going to hit him in the face.\n\nI get back at about 10:45 and still no orders so I organize all my money and collect my credit/debit tips and a call comes in at 10:52 pm for an $80 order. I can hear the woman haggling to use multiple coupons on this order and it wasn't allowed but this guy told her that he was so nice he'd even throw a free 2 Litre of pop in. He probably just wanted to stop the screaming over the phone.\n\nSo I'm standing there with 5 minutes until closing and if looks could kill the kitchen staff would have been in prison. They start making this order and I'm standing there baffled that I now have to wait until about 11:15 to even take this fucking order. \n\nI'm finally driving to this place in freezing rain and someone plows through an intersection and almost hits my vehicle. I had to pull over and get my shit together it was that bad. I make it to this lady's house and she's upset that it took 20 minutes from the time she ordered to the time it got there. She says \"Well you close at 11 right? So like... shouldn't it have been here before 11?\" Like, listen lady, just because you call at fucking 10:55 pm does not mean that there are mystical genies who will procure your pizza in 2 minutes for delivery. \n\nI just let her know I'm sorry about the time it took as it is freezing rain. Which at this point she seems to realize that I am standing outside drenched, shivering, and she sort of looks around and says \"Oh yea wow it looks cold out there\". So I nervously laugh and ask her very politely if she would mind if I stepped into her porch to get the items out of the bag. She said no I couldn't come into her porch. \n\nThis was an old, musty, dirty porch, but she was not having me out of that rain. So she pulls out her coupons and she goes \"Now I know that I got the breadstick deal but can I also have the one to upgrade my pizzas to a large size\". I just stood there staring at her. What the fuck is happening? Is she trying to fucking haggle me? At this point I was pissed off I'm like \"Oh I don't actually do any of the prices/cooking, I'm just the driver so I just picked this order up and bring it to you. If there are any issues you should probably call the place and they'll take care of it\". \n\nSo she stands there holding her coupons looking pissed off. She used one coupon to get the breadstick deal, she also received a free 2 litre of pop and now she wants her medium pizzas to magically turn into fucking larges as I'm holding them in the freezing rain. \n\nSo I ask her if she would like this order or if I should return it. She huffs and says she will be calling my manager and that she'll 'settle'. So I take the food out of the bag and she hands me a huge fucking ziplock bag of nickels and dimes..... on a $80 order. \n\nShe then smirks at me, walks inside and turns off her outside light. I'm now in pitch dark frothing with fucking anger. \n\nI get back into my car and drive back to the pizza place. As I walk in the door I can see that smug douche enjoying that I am freezing cold and drenched in water and I put the money down on the counter. He says \"How much is in there?\" I tell him \"I have no idea that's what she gave me\" and he's like \"Well if there isn't enough in there than you'll be paying for the difference, oh another order came in and the kitchen staff left already so I'm just whipping it up and it'll be ready in about 15 minutes\". I ask him how that's possible as we close at 11:00 pm. He told me \"Well I know you have a big test tomorrow and I've been bothering you studying all night but you just looked so good I thought I'd keep the place open until midnight ;)\".\n\nNope. My reaction should be the official image of \"noping the fuck out\". I just looked incredulous, screamed \"ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME?!\" and left. That was that. \n\nQueue 5 months later when I decide to finally place an order as there are not much options in a small town. I go to pay for my wrap and it's in a box and ready to go and when he looks up to see that it's me who ordered it he goes \"Oh sorry, yea this isn't available for take-out it's dine in only\". \n\nNope.",

I know damned well that if we close at 8pm, it will take hours to get caught up on runs and cleaning up. It could be between 10pm and midnight before we actually leave. That is during the peak of the storm. \n\nI'm about 90% sure I'm going to call out, during the time that you can without getting into trouble, per se. I will just have to wait until the closest weather report to noon time and make a decision. I think if 90% of our skeleton crew on a normal Thursday crew calls out or no shows, they will have no choice but to close. I'm not doing this because I'm lazy. I'm doing this because my job will not pay for damages to my car for flying debris or because another idiot hit me while driving. \n\nRolling your windows down, when you are driving between 35 and 55mph, is very different than walking around, unprotected by a car, taking a delivery to the front door. Workman's comp might pay for injuries, but they won't pay for flying debris damage to your car. Some might argue about full coverage insurance. That may be so but getting that taken care of is a big pain in the ass, if you've ever had to do that before. I have, and it is no fun!\n\nAll this bs for a minimum wage job!",

Always wanted to be a driver since I get sort of bored just working in the back, but never really got the chance being 16.\n\nAnyway, a friend of mine recently tipped me off about an opening at a local shop after a kid who used to go to the local HS and worked there died of drugs. I jumped on it, they hired me on the spot, cash at the end of the night and nobody gave a damn that I'm 16 and a month into my license. Seems like a good hookup right now, better money then I've ever made, but I'm somewhat concerned about my license (and my job) if I were to get pulled over or stopped, since they'd probably come back on my shop and I'd be out of a job and my license, not to mention the smell when you use your car as the nightly hotbox. I'm no expert on the law and how or where these age laws are enforced, so just curious if anyone else has done anything like this in the past and how it turned out.",

        "text": "So I took over as a manager in a new town and was finally getting used to the regulars and recognizing them. Lou was amazing and I'll always remember him, but then there was Randall. Randall was a douche. We would have shaker boarders outside, usually girls age 15-17, and he would drive by with an air horn and laugh when he would scare them. So I hired a male shaker boarder. He would always criticize whoever made his pizza (too sloppy, not enough toppings, not smiling, etc) and he would complain about us to other customers in a \"joking\" manner. He also liked to remind us how he used to be a district manager of a different pizza chain and he knows customer service (then you should know you're being a douche). \n\nAnyway main point. Randall comes in on $10 Tuesday being his average self. I was training a new guy on register so Randall is asking him a million questions to test him and get a rise out of him. He gets his pizza and leaves. The next day I get a call and Randall had came back saying he didn't get the special price (charged $12 instead of $10) and even had his receipt. My supervisor offered him $2 but that wasn't enough, he wanted a free pizza for his trouble. Of fucking course. So she told me he would be back in the next day to speak to me. Whoopie... \n\nNext day he shows up and I'm the only one in the store. He slams down his receipt and says \"I want my free pizza, I've been here twice now.\" Whatever I don't care I slap a smile on my face, apologize and ask what he would like. He replies \n\n&gt;\" I'd like it if maybe you got off your lazy ass and did something around here.\"\n\nNope. I take a step back from the register and cross my arms.\n\n&gt;\"REALLY!?\"\n\nHe turns with a shit grin on his face and looks at me then his face drops. He gets a scared look and goes \"Oh shit, that's your serious face.\" \n\n\"Yup.\" I always have a smile in front of customers. Even my employees would make fun of me when I would talk to people because my customer face is so faking good. He knows I'm mad.\n\nHe apologizes, gets his pizza without a word, and leaves. From that day on I never heard another complaint from my employees about him and he actually treated me with respect when he came in. \n",
