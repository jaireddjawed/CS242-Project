        "text": "$Me = the one and only, $IU = illiterate user\n\nLittle back story: I stepped into the role as a Net Admin/Help Desk for a company that had major IT issues and let all their previous staff go. *edit* I had also enforced updates and made everyone log into their computers as their domain user accounts, so people lost many freedoms that they previously had in regards to installing garbage on their machines. For a while after these changes every ticket/email came through as \"IT broke my computer.\" \n\nI get an email from $IU telling me: \"You broke my Chrome. Now nothing works and I cannot do my job. You need to fix Chrome now\" and he copied about every VP and Manager that I knew of at the company.\n\nI have no idea of anyone's technical knowledge yet, so I figure it was something dumb. Maybe he deleted a shortcut or can't figure out how to find his favorites. \n\nAnyways, I give $IU a call and remote connect to his machine. I quickly see Chrome pinned to his task bar, open it up, and browse to a web page. \n\n&gt;$Me: It looks like Chrome is working. Are you seeing the page I pulled up?\n\n&gt;$IU: That's not the Chrome I use.\n\n&gt;$Me: It's not the Chrome you use?\n\n&gt;$IU: I use the Chrome with the Green Icon\n\nI'm completely confused at this point. Maybe thinking he has a different third party browser, possibly something malicious, installed. \n\n&gt;$Me: Can you show me?\n\nThe user navigates to the Start Menu and opens Excel. He then proceeds to type a web address into the formula bar and exclaims...\n\n&gt;$IU: See, the page is not loading. It just shows as blue text. Chrome is broken after you made my computer do updates. \n\n&gt;$Me: This is Microsoft Excel, not Chrome. You should not be using this to browse the internet. Use the Icon I used *I moved the cursor in circles over the Chrome icon*\n\n&gt;$Me: If you don't mind me asking - what did it used to do when you went to websites in Excel -or green chrome?\n\n&gt;$IU: Well, it never worked on this computer, but it worked at home. \n\n&gt;$Me: *I decide not to comment on it working at home* Okay, but lets try that website you want to visit in the other Chrome\n\n*User opens Chrome and types in the website.*\n\n&gt;$IU: Thanks, this is works. So from now on I use this Chrome and not the Green Chrome? \n\n&gt;$Me: Umm. Yeah, just use that Chrome. The other one is Excel. It is used for spreadsheets. \n\n&gt;$IU: Okay, I will use the colorful chrome. Thank you\n\nOh the adventures of working at a new company. ",

So sorry for any poor formatting.\n\n\n$me = the one and only\n$user = user\n\n\nI support an office of around 80 people, just me and the network admin, things are pretty normal around here and I don't get very many interesting stories to share but I did have something peculiar happen this morning.\n\n\nThis morning $user walked up to my desk to inform me that his computer has blue screened 3 times in the last couple hours and that this has happened before but it would usually happen once and then be fine. So I walk over to his desk with him, he has dual monitors (important). When we arrive he shows me the action he performs in excel to trigger the error. Lo and behold the dreaded BSOD shows up on his right monitor with the error SYSTEM_SERVICE_EXCEPTION. Although the odd part wasn't the BSOD but the fact that his left monitor (the one he had excel on) was still displaying excel and was frozen. So I quickly walk back to my desk to google the error as any good tech would and find some common causes, one being something to do with a graphics driver. I then remember that he has been using a USB 2.0 to DVI adapter for his left monitor. So, I walk back to his desk, grabbing a DisplayPort to DVI adapter on my way. When I arrived our exchange went something like:\n\n\n&gt;$me: Okay, I am going to ask something really weird, before I do anything can you try doing exactly what you did before but do it on the right monitor.  \n\n\n&gt;$user: Okay?.....  \n\n$user performs the task and the computer does not blue screen.  \n\n&gt;$me: aha! Now try moving excel to the other monitor.  \n\n$user moves excel to the other monitor and the computer instantly blue screens again. I then swap out the display adapter and throw out the old one.\n\n\nTLDR: Excel causes computer to BSOD due to an old USB 2.0 to DVI adapter.\n",

I've been helping my father for a while to set up his new laptop, which is of a crappier Lenovo model because I'm the dedicated IT-tech-savvy master of our household. \n\n\nI had just set up his PC and he managed to set up his local windows account before I transferred a bunch of stuff, mainly family photos from 2008 through 2016 with the use of a thumb drive.\n\n\nA few weeks pass and he really, really messed something up. I don't know what he did, but something fucked over his profile in such a way where I had to make a new one. So I just did it. It never crossed my mind that all those family photos was there before my father pointed it out. I freak out a little bit now, because I let it slip over my head.\n\n\nI quickly download recuva and try to pull a lucky shot by trying to recover them onto an external HDD with no luck. \n\n\nThe anxiety is growing on me now, and I tell him I'll fix it and get them back. After hours of googling, browsing through tech support subreddits and considering just shushing it away the anxiety just snaps and I start shaking, because it simply *can't afford to loose these photos.*\n\n\nBut then a lightbulb lights up in my head. The thumb drive. *The damn thumb drive.* I hadn't used it since I copied over those files. I rush into my room and start looking for it. Not on my desk. Not in my drawer. The I realised, it's in my backpack. I almost tear it open, and uses recuva to grab them off it. \n\n\nIt worked. \n\n\nBefore people tell me **\"BACKUP YOU FUCKING IDIOT\"**, I have backups now, on the thumb drive, on my laptop, on his and on Drive. It's safe now.\n\n\n*TL;DR*: Accidentally deleted a decade worth of family photos and got them back with a helluva lot of luck.",

        "text": "EDIT: Holy smokes, Reddit Gold! Thank you kind fellow Redditor!\n\nWorking in higher ed, we had some generous benefits, including considerable yearly vacation. So much that with having to work Christmas shutdown usually (IT never sleeps), the entire IT department often lost days because we never used all our vacation.\n\nAll of us except $Red, of course. $Red would bitch, constantly and loudly, about work during the holiday shutdown. Every.Single.Time. He didn't seem to get that IT was a \"service\" to the college and that occasionally we had to work when other people didn't.  But the reason $Red never lost any days was because he somehow managed to blow every lick of vacation, sick time or bereavement leave he had. And not just 2 days here, 4 days there. No, no, $Red would take two solid weeks at a crack in the middle of a semester. At tremendously inconvenient times. \n\nThe whole college had a bright line \"no time off during student move-in week\" rule. The week the freshmen showed up, and then all the upperclass students came back, it was \"all hands on deck\" for 7-10 days straight. We even brought on some hired guns for helpdesk support to lighten the load and spread out the support hours each day to be sure we got everybody connected, etc. We even kept a couple of these guys on for a few weeks thereafter until the support load lessened.\n\nEach year the college put out the administrative calendar for the following year around the beginning of the fall semester, including holidays, vacation blackout dates, etc. And every year, $Red would try to put in for some vacation during the fall or spring student move-ins, be told \"No, vacation blackout\" and he'd rant and rave for weeks afterward about the injustice of it all. It was almost comical if it hadn't been annoying as hell after the first time, listening to a mid-50s adult male whine like an entitled bitch about how he's so put upon, life and $ITVP are so unfair, etc. Whatever dude. Your kid is getting tuition-free college at a pretty high-end school, you're getting 6+ weeks of vacation a year, you're paid 25% more than anybody else in the department. Quit bitching.\n\nWhen $Red would take his mid-semester vacations, it was pretty much impossible for us to go 2 weeks at a clip without someone sitting in the NOC handling network problems. Especially the way $Red had the network so lashed up.  So $ITVP would call a staffing agency we used to send us a network administrator \"stand-in\" for $Red. Generally, it worked out pretty good, because the stand-in would discover all the things $Red was ignoring or hadn't bothered to do, they'd put together a list of things that really should be fixed over the long term, and a  couple times a year $ITVP got an independent list of \"things that need to be done.\" That didn't come from $Red. (that $Red complained about)\n\nMy second summer was when we replaced all the switches and implemented the Network Access Control system, and this coming fall's move-in was going to be our first \"big\" experience with it. The fly in the ointment, however, was that $Red's oldest daughter was headed off to her first year of college, too. Her school in the next state had the same campus move-in dates as we did, and there was, in $Red's words, \"No way my kid is going to college and I'm not taking here there.\"  So $Red wheedled and finagled with $ITVP to take **three** days off during what was our busiest week of the year. *Nobody* got time off during move-in unless it was a death in the family, and here's $Red telling anybody who will listen that he's getting three days off while everybody has to work. The *entire* IT department was on the warpath after that. \n\nThere's always something that $Red had to do during move-in weekends: fixing user accounts, rebuilding student drives, email setups, dorm switches, whatever. And this fall we have the complication of the brand-new NAC setup and a new way of registering, scanning and enabling student computers on the network. Its supposed to be *easier* and more streamlined for students to register and remediate their own computers so they should only have to see us when there is a problem.  We shouldn't have to touch every single student computer by hand. But we (the $UserSupport and $Network team) haven't really seen the NAC in full-on action with hundreds of students trying to login, follow instructions, etc. It was either going to be awesome or a complete shit show. I wasn't going to build my support assumptions this first time around on a smooth ride and get caught behind the eight ball. \n\nHaving $Red gone, with a brand-new NAC and physical network, when the tidal wave of freshmen hit was a major non-starter, and I told $ITVP that. But she'd already given $Red the go-ahead. \n\nHowever, she agreed to two things: \n\nFirst, $Walt, the expert who had just worked us thru the entire implementation, and arguably knew the NAC better than $Red did, would stay on through the first two weeks of school. He'd help with any problems, additional support staff training, etc. $Walt was actually excited so see the whole thing in action having just worked for 5+ months with us on the project. $Walt was a little nerdy and said he seldom got to see the \"fruits of his labor in action.\"  $Walt was a pretty crackerjack network admin, so I felt pretty good that the physical network would be in good hands with $Red gone.\n\nSecond, $ITVP had the staffing agency send us the stand-in for $Red's mid-semester vacation a little early. He could get familiar with our network and the NAC with $Red and $Walt before $Red took his kid to college and working with $Walt. Then the stand-in would spend a few weeks doing user support with my team, and go back to network administration during $Red's scheduled vacation. It was good for continuity, it was good for $Red, it was good for my support folks, and of course the staffing people weren't going to complain about the billable hours.\n\nTwo days before freshman move-in, $Red's stand-in showed up. $ITVP and I briefed the stand-in and his $AccountManager the first day, giving him a thumbnail sketch of the department, the expectations and $ITVP's vision. Immediately, I realized that this guy was was really *everything* $Red wasn't: smart, engaging, willing to communicate, willing to go the extra mile, skilled at the job, could think outside the box, had a depth of knowledge beyond Google, knew and admitted what he didn't know, etc. And he was friendly. \n\nDue to that, lets call him $NotRed. \n\nI filled $NotRed in on what I thought he was going to run into as traps and pitfalls while we walked from $ITVP's office to the NOC. $Red left the day before freshman move-in, telling me that he thought it was going to be a complete shit show because my support team wasn't \"up to the job.\" Hey, wow, thanks $Red for that awesome assessment of my guys.  \n\nOddly, the entire freshman move-in went fairly smoothly: $NotRed &amp; $Walt handled any odd NAC things that came up, my support team with the temps came up to speed on most of the idiosyncrasies of the NAC quickly, and were able to get get things moving along in a matter of hours instead of days. By the end of the Day 2 we had more than 90% of the freshman laptops checked in, remediated and on the network. There's always those systems students bring that don't meet the published specs (\"Hey, wow, Win98. Awesome.\") or require extra work (\"No anti-virus or anti-spyware, never been updated, and 212 viruses. SCORE!\"). But because the NAC was making the students do most of the work like updates and AV scanning as part of the registration process, my support team only had to deal with the systems that wouldn't pass for whatever reason. The upperclass students were actually *more* troublesome since the NAC was \"not the way they'd always done it,\" their systems were more likely to be in even worse shape than the freshmen because they were older, and they basically ignored most of the user messaging we'd put together on the subject.\n\n(Actual conversation overheard in the Help Desk one afternoon)\n&gt;$Student: \"What do you mean, Windows 95 isn't going to work? My uncle gave me this laptop when I started here 3 years ago! It its a top of the line computer!\"\n\n&gt;$SupportTech: \"Yeah, in 1997. This is 2004!\"\n\nBut even then, at least 90% of the upperclass computers were on the network within three days of their arrival, so generally not bad. $Walt went on his merry way a few days earlier than planned since things were operating smoothly, we had support from the NAC vendor, and both $Red and $NotRed had a good handle on the process. $NotRed finished out the move-in week with my user support team and we were making good headway in killing off any outstanding tickets leftover from move-in. At the same time, $NotRed did something $Red *never* did: He actually used the Help Desk ticket system and started mining thru old open tickets to either fix the problem or close the ticket as no longer needed. Our open ticket number dropped precipitously, especially all the tickets sitting in the \"network\" queue that were beneath $Red's contempt. Printers, PCs, wireless issues, wiring issues, all of it, $NotRed didn't care: He was here, he wanted to work, so let him find and fix things. He traipsed all over campus addressing student, staff &amp; faculty issues, closing tickets and getting good reviews from the user community.  \n\nAbout 5 weeks after freshman move in, $Red left for his 2+ week vacation. As planned, $NotRed went from doing mostly end-user support in the help desk to the chair in $Red's office in the NOC. But he continued to close tickets. He found problems in the NOC, documented the issue and fixed it. He rewired a switch closet in a dorm. He even continued to \"go walk about\" to find and fix *any* open help desk tickets, even end-user stuff. The user community had gotten used to seeing $NotRed's face all around the campus and the feedback was positive.\n\nMiddle of $Red's first vacation week, I was in $ITVP's office discussing a faculty issue when out of the blue she asked \"Do you think we should hire $NotRed?\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"Do you mean to work with $Red? That might be troublesome.\"\n\n&gt;$ITVP: \"No, I mean *instead* of $Red.\"\n\n&gt;$Me: (shocked) \"Uhh, is this even a possibility?\"\n\n&gt;$ITVP: \"Look, I've been thinking about this a long time, but $NotRed made me realize that $Red just sucks.\"\n\nNever mind that I'd been telling $ITVP for a year that $Red was the reason our shit didn't work right and that we had so much downtime.  Guess she needed some processing time on that info.\n\n&gt;$Me: \"Can we even get $NotRed? How much would that cost?\"\n\n&gt;$ITVP: \"I can hire him direct, have to pay a premium to the staffing agency for that, and still not be at $Red's salary. Do you think $NotRed would want to do that?\"\n\n&gt;$Me: (having discussed with $NotRed his interest in working for us some weeks before) \"Uh, yeah, I'm pretty sure.\"\n\n&gt;$ITVP: \"Ok... when $Red gets back from vacation, I'm going to let him go.\"\n\n$ITVP waved her hand and changed the subject. Unfortunately for us, much like all her other \"good ideas\" she failed to follow through with this idea. It was all just a random thought that popped into her head and then went away just like that, never to be heard from again. Typical $ITVP.\n\nA little over a week later, $Red came back from vacation to find a laundry list of things that $NotRed had fixed, improved, changed and documented on his desk. $NotRed stayed a day or two more to do any handover and then left for another assignment with the staffing agency. We were sad to see $NotRed go, and held a little 'going away party' in the Help Desk for him that didn't include $Red, because he was happy to see $NotRed go. $NotRed was a threat to his existence. \n\nAt our next departmental meetings, $Red was more direct:\n\n&gt;$Red: \"$NotRed exceeded his authority. He wasn't just holding down the fort like I told him to do.  Its going to take me six months to go thru and find all the shit he changed!\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"You mean all the stuff he documented and fixed??\"\n\n&gt;$Red: \"There's no way he did that much while I was gone!\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"No, he did a lot more. Thats just the network stuff.\" \n\n&gt;$Red: \"He changed stuff I would never change!\"\n\n(I watched the faces of my team after $Red made that last pronouncement. I though my $HelpDeskLead was going to say something like \"Yeah, and thats the reason the network is running better\", but thankfully he held his tongue)\n\nThe proof was in the pudding regarding $NotRed when I was in the admin building about a week or two after $NotRed left. One of the departmental admins asked me where $NotRed was.\n\n&gt;$Me: \"Oh, his last day was almost 2 weeks ago.\"\n\n&gt;$Admin: \"What? You mean he's already quit?\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"No, $NotRed was a temp we had in from $StaffingAgency, like we do for freshman move-in. He was with us a little longer than normal because he was also filling in for $Red's vacation.\"\n\n&gt;$Admin: \"No way! I thought he was a full time employee.\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"What made you think that?\"\n\n&gt;$Admin: \"Well, I mean, he was here early in the morning and late in the afternoon every day, and he actually took ownership of some of the problems we were experiencing, asked us about them, and he actually fixed them.  Which was completely not my experience with $Red.\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"Make sure you tell your boss that. And make sure he knows that $ITVP should know that.\"\n\ntl;dr We bring in a temp to cover student move-in and $Red's vacation, folks think that the temp is a FTE and $Red's replacement. $ITVP fails to pull the trigger and get rid of $Red when she can. A lack of hilarity ensues.\n",

We're having parts of our office lose power, and other parts not lose power. What the fuck is going on. couple minutes later, all power is out. \n\nTurns out, our maintenance department was welding, and our building didn't have enough juice to power everything so we were essentially having our office brown out, but then a 600amp fuse in our electrical box out back blew, and we lost all power to the building. Awesome, I get to go home early. \n\n**May 9th, 9:15 AM**\n\nI've been at work about 30 minutes by now, on my second cup of coffee, when one of our employees walks into my hallway (I don't really have an office... I'm kind of in a hallway... long story) We're doing to call this employee $Kia, short for Know It All. I'll be $JD. \n\n$Kia: \"Hey, $JD. When the power went out yesterday, it fried my computer. I need a new one.\"\n\n$JD: \"Did you not shut it down when your UPS started beeping?\"\n\n$Kia: \"What's a UPS?\"\n\n$JD: \"It's the giant black power strip that your computer and one of your monitors is plugged into. In the case of a power outage, it will power your computer long enough to save your work and power down your computer safely.\"\n\n$Kia: \"I don't have one of those.\" \n\n$JD: \"Yes you do, i set up your workstation.\"\n\n$Kia: \"yeah but i moved my desk to the other side of the room, and didn't know what that was so when i moved it, i didn't use that thing.\"\n\n$JD: sigh... \"OK, let me go take a look.\"\n\nI walked over to that set of offices (We have two sets of offices in our building with a warehouse and production facility in between them). I get to his desk, sit down, press the power button, and i see the computer light up and come to life.\n\n$JD: \"$Kia, I just pushed the power button and it came on...\"\n\n$Kia: \"I'm not an idiot. I know how to turn it on. But nothing happens on the screen.\"\n\n$JD: \"Well, did you try...\" *pushes the power button to the monitor* \"turning the monitor on?\" *monitor lights up, straight to log in screen*\n\n$Kia: \"Uh, well, yeah, i tried it, but it uh, it didn't work for me when i did that.\"\n\n$JD: \"OK, well, here you go.\"\n\nI don't even know how to close this post. I'm baffled. I'm at a loss for words. ",

        "text": "We have a device that gets numbers. These numbers are copied by hand by a tech, then some arithmetic is done on them to get the desired answer. This is all done with a calculator + pen/paper, with the results documented in an official logbook. I was asked to generate graphs of the results.\n\nI decide I'm not going to copy thousands of handwritten digits into a spreadsheet. I go to the device, and notice that all of the results are saved, and can be exported to csv. Jackpot. Unfortunately, $Idiot walks in and threatens to fire me for touching it, and says that I wouldn't be allowed to do so without written permission from $BigBoss.\n\nFine. I go explain to $BigBoss. As I am doing so, $Idiot runs in, yelling that under no circumstances I should be allowed to break his systems. $BigBoss asks if I can get the data another way. Answer: yes, but it will cost me a day of typing and a few days of checking, when I can simply do it without mistakes in 15 minutes this way. I am asked to type them in.\n\nSo be it. I try to ocr the data, but unsurprisingly this fails, so I get $Secretary to type in the raw numbers for me, and we go through and check for errors. After several rounds of checking, we decide that this is as close as we are likely to get. I build the equations into a spreadsheet, print the graphs and the spreadsheets, and I'm done.\n\nOr so I thought. It turns out that my calculations don't always match those performed by the techs. $Idiot demands that I fix them. I go through and check my work, finding no errors. I check the work done by the techs, and find numerous errors. $Idiot demands that I change mine to match the results in the offical logbook.\n\nOh well. So I change some of the values, color coding the the errors by type (rounding, incorrect inputs, incorrect equation, etc.). I'm sure these are going to get removed by $Idiot before the data gets passed along, but at least it makes me feel better. So I'm done?\n\nNope. $Idiot thinks the numbers (percentages) look better without a percent sign. He points out that he has all of the techs write their answers in this format. My explanations that you can't just write 99 when you mean 99% fall on deaf ears. So that gets changed too.\n\nI think I'm done now, and can go back to my normal tasks, but I've been wrong before.\n\n\nTl;Dr: I have a high alcohol tolerance.",

You try and launch them and you are greeted with a message informing you that the network administrator has banned this program.\n\nEveryone was disappointed but understood. We figured someone with power had walked through the room while two techs were engaged in Hearthstone antics and had complained to our director and that was that. \n\nToday I was doing some PC cleanup. I pull up my programs list and see my installed Steam games and figure I'll uninstall them since I can't enjoy them on my lunch break anymore. I click on uninstall and the Steam login pops up. I login to Steam to start the uninstall but then I realize I've just discovered something wonderful. \n\nI realized I can begin to uninstall a Steam game to bypass the network policies preventing me from launching it. Cancel the uninstall, launch a game, there it is. I ask my coworker to try the same thing with Hearthstone and voila, he's in! \n\nI tell my fellow Tier 1's and we all share a good laugh. We aren't going to risk our jobs to play Hearthstone at lunch but we are still amused with the workaround. We decide to show the Director what we have discovered. Turns out, he didn't even know Steam and Battle.net are blocked. \n\nThe call to block these games was not made by our manager, our Director, our CIO nor anyone who is actually in charge of us. One Tier 2 took it upon himself to enact this network policy. \n\nHe's been a Tier 2 for six months. He literally was in our seats playing these games and living this life six months ago. Our ticket counts are in better shape than they were when he was doing our job. There had been no complaints or even discussions about the change.\n\nI'm sure sneaky behavior without management approval and betrayal will take him far in his career. \n\n**TL;DR: Guy gets promoted to Tier 2 tech and thinks he is CIO. Blocks our access to games (poorly) and is a hypocrite.** *and I get salty and post about it on TFTS like a salty mc saltyface*",

This is not one of those calls.\n\n&gt; Lawyer: I just received an email saying my password expires soon, can I have some help changing it?\n\n&gt; Me: Sure thing, let me look up the correct procedure for doing this.\n\n*Several law firms had \"special\" methods for changing their passwords, and I needed to make sure this was not one of them. Also, I needed to look up the procedure for changing passwords on his end via past tickets, since we usually deal with the expired stuff. Once again, firms sometimes had \"special\" ways for users to do this. As I look through the past tickets, I notice this firm has a huge number of tickets with this exact issue, some from today even.

        "text": "I read a story on here that reminded me of something that I forgot to share with you. I work as a mentor rep for tech support. \n\n\n Essentially, we have our own steps of escalations when we have an outage or lots of offices/centers go down. One of these steps is to send off a Critical Incident Ticket (CIT) which goes to just about everyone up to the VP to advise that there's a massive outage. This time was different.\n\nOne day, we had one customer with no service. We were getting a new office going and this customer was going to be the first one on this office. Now, that office went down because it was new and not yet activated. I advise my Manager (M) about this.\n\n\nMe: Hey, M.\n\nM: Hi u/devdevo1919. What's up?\n\n\nMe: So, we have an office down but--\n\n\nM: Create a CIT!\n\n\nMe: But, it's one customer and the office has not been activated.\n\n\nM: It's still an office down! Create a CIT!\n\n\nMe: But, M. It's only **ONE** customer on this office.\n\n\nM: The process is to create a CIT. Please create one.\n\n\nI return to my desk and create the ticket and send it off. I feel ridiculous because I know a lot of people way above me are going to be emailing me and asking why I created a CIT for an office that wasn't even activated yet.\n\n\nSure enough, about 15 minutes later, I have about a dozen emails from at least a half dozen different managers asking:\n\n\n&gt;Why is this for one customer?\n\n\n&gt;What is this for?\n\n\n&gt;Why is only one customer affected?\n\n\nAnd so on. Each of these emails had my boss CC'ed to it so I get hauled into his office to explain myself. I was honest and then M got hauled in. My boss wanted me to forward each email asking why to M so he could reply and explain why a ticket designated for massive outages was made for ONE person. \n\n\nNeedless to say, M was scheduled for training on when and how to use the CIT tool and I had a few extra cups of coffee. Each manager that originally replied apologized to me and since then I have not been asked to create a CIT again unless it's a legitimate outage.\n",

        "text": "By, er, popular demand, another story about University Boss!\n\n**Me**: A PFY (jr. sysadmin/support person) in a large university's computer science department.\n\n**Boss**: Sr. Computer Science sysadmin, my supervisor, bureaucratic genius, and all-around good guy.  Hero of several previous stories I've posted.\n\n**PP**: Physical Plant, the buildings &amp; grounds maintenance department.\n\n**Scene**: We need to run an Ethernet cable from a room to an adjacent room.  About 20 years ago.  The doors to these rooms had a nice gap underneath (this is important).\n\n&gt; Boss: Just get a 50' UTP cable and run it under the door like the other two that are already there.\n\n&gt; Me: Wouldn't it be better to do it properly?  Through the walls with RJ45 jacks and all that?\n\n&gt; Boss: Trust me, under the door is way better.\n\n&gt; Me: That doesn't make any sense.\n\n&gt; Boss: Let me tell you a story.  Physical Plant (PP) is unionized here.  Their contract says that if any of certain kinds of work is to be done, it MUST be done by unionized PP people.  Non-unionized workers doing union work is one of the few things that can get a person fired almost instantly at a university.  A few years ago, they got network cable installation and repair added to that list.  So it would be illegal and could get the University sued if somebody else did the cabling.  \n\n&gt; Me: That sounds annoying, but...\n\n&gt; Boss: Also nobody trained PP how to do data cabling.\n\n&gt; Me: ...\n\n&gt; Boss: So here's how it goes.  You put in a work order, they show up in a week or two, about an hour before quitting time.  They put up a ladder, take down a ceiling tile, and dangle an Ethernet cable from the ceiling, then leave early for the day.  They'll come back the next day about an hour before lunch, do 10 minutes of work, then leave early for lunch.  Several days later, the network run will be done, and they'll leave.  You will then discover it doesn't work.  If you are particularly unlucky, you will also discover several existing connections that had nothing to do with the change are also broken.\n\n&gt; Me: But I still think that we should do it properly.\n\n&gt; Boss: You still have much to learn.  Fine.  We'll try it your way.  You'll see.  Shall we ask them to cable up those two existing runs under the doors \"properly\" also?\n\n&gt; Me: That sounds good.\n\nSo sure enough, just as Boss predicted, a week later a PP cable installer shows up, not long before lunch.  I walk by the room a few minutes later, there's a ladder, a hole in the ceiling, and no installer.  A few days later, the work order is closed and the ladder is gone.\n\n&gt; Boss: Follow me.\n\nI follow Boss into one of the rooms.  Hanging out of the wall are three Ethernet cables with RJ45 ends on them.  One of the cables has a wire sticking out next to the RJ45 end, not IN it.  Also, no plates.  No jacks.  No electrical box.  Just an ugly-looking hole in the drywall with wires hanging out.\n\n&gt; Me: Uhmmm...  You did ask for jacks, right?\n\n&gt; Boss: Of course.\n\n&gt; Me: What now?\n\n&gt; Boss: I make a work order for them to fix it.\n\nA week or so passes, and now the cables are punched down into jacks -- but still no wall plate, still just hanging out of a hole.  Another week or two and they're in a plate looking all proper.\n\n&gt; Boss: Why don't you go test the new runs.\n\n&gt; Me: Sure thing, Boss!\n\nIt should be no surprise to you at this point that zero out of three network ports worked.\n\n&gt; Me: ... and so I guess we need to make a work order for PP to figure out what's wrong with the runs.\n\n&gt; Boss: They will refuse to do that, on the grounds that it's not in their job description.  They will INSTALL and REPAIR but not DIAGNOSE.\n\n&gt; Me: How do we deal with this then?\n\nBoss then, with a hint of fear and a measure of secrecy, produces a punch tool I didn't even know he had (I think it was stashed behind a bunch of old [thinwire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10BASE2) NICs), took me to the jack in question, and educated me on the art of Ethernet termination, pointing out the color legend on the back side of the jacks and how the cabling didn't match it.\n\nNow you've got to understand about Boss, he was a genius about navigating bureaucracy, but he always stayed strictly within the letter of the rules.\n\n&gt; Boss: I am telling you, you are not permitted to repair this cable.  However, in order to figure out whether the problem was incorrect termination, you may need to move these wires.  I will let you figure it out from here.  Oh, and keep the door locked while you're using the punch tool.  In fact, just keep the punch tool completely out of sight.  Got it?\n\nI proceed to re-punch the connections into the jacks.  Wonder of wonders, they seem to work.  I go back to Boss's office.\n\n&gt; Boss: So what did you do?\n\n&gt; Me: Well, I....\n\n&gt; Boss: And before you say anything, pretend I'm the dean.  Think carefully.\n\n&gt; Me: Ah.  Well, I, uh...  diagnosed... them.  And, uh, all of a sudden they worked.\n\n&gt; Boss: And...?\n\n&gt; Me: And... uhm...  maybe they were working all along and I just did something wrong?\n\n&gt; Boss: You just took a step towards enlightenment.  Well done, grasshopper.\n\n&gt; Me: Thanks!\n\n&gt; Boss: Now let me ask you a question.  What do you think the likelihood is, that on at least one of those new runs, you'll find they ran out of cable and used 8 poorly-attached wire nuts to splice cables together?\n\n&gt; Me: Uh... I'm starting to get the feeling like I'd rather not answer that question.\n\n&gt; Boss: Another step towards enlightenment.  Would you like to crawl up in the ceiling and inspect the runs?\n\n&gt; Me: Uhm.  I think it would be better not to know.\n\n&gt; Boss: Yes.  And next time I tell you to run Ethernet cables under the door, what are you going to do?\n\n&gt; Me: Trust that you know what you're doing?\n\n&gt; Boss: You'll make Jedi yet, young padawan!",

        "text": "Over the past month our company decided to \"shake things up\" and bring in a consulting firm to help \"bring efficiency to the next level.\" At first everyone was very wary that this would be an resume generating event. However consulting company sent out a memo to all employees. \n\nThey stated that their goal is not to \"synergize the core values with productivity paradigm shifts.\" Basically this memo called out all of the BS terms that companies like to use and made fun of them. They stated their core goal was to look at our P&amp;P and work out how to deal with them. \n\nWhen it came to our turn for the consultants, at first they were very helpful. They mentioned that we were taking a few unnecessary steps in fixing common issues. \n\nFor instance when outlook refuses to take the correct password on local desktop, you do not have to rebuild outlook profile everytime. A time save would be hitting \"other user\" and having the user do a full login again instead of rebuilding the outlook profile. \n\nOr in the case of printers. IF the IP address changes on the printer, you do not always have to reinstall it. Can simply go to printer properties and change the port. \n\nAll of these were things that I knew and thought my team knew, but that was not the case. I had lapsed in getting KB articles out to the team for these and people were fixing issues using methods that took longer. \n\nI thought this was the end of it. \n\nLast monday. \n\nI come into the office and am pulled into the conference room with the head of IT, EVP of IT, and VP of networking. These consultants were done playing good cop and were auditing the tickets and calls. \n\nAt first they ran through a TON of minor issues and ignoring them as they went on until they \"noticed a trend\" amongst some of my golden employees. The ones I refuse to let go without a damn good reason. \n\n&gt; $C1 = Consultant 1 or bob  \n&gt; $C2 = Consultant 2 or bob  \n&gt; $VPN = VP of Networking or Kara Thrace  \n&gt; $HIT = Head of IT or William Adama  \n&gt; $Me = Gul Dukat  \n&gt; $EVPIT  = Obi Wan Kenobi \n\nSo the first one they sent my way was a simple one. \n\n&gt; $C1 - We have pulled up a few glaring examples here and we wanted your input.  \n\n&gt; $ME - *Takes a look at the ticket in question* So the user wanted us to open corrupted PDF files for them and send them back. We informed the user that the files were corrupted and closed the ticket.  \n\n&gt; $C2 - But it did not stay closed.  \n\n&gt; $Me - Right because the manager and the LO in this ticket had an email conversation with each other while still CCing IT and reopening the ticket over and over again.  \n\n&gt; $C1 - So you are saying it was not the Techs fault for being unable to keep the ticket closed?  \n\n&gt; $me - *My leg stops shaking, my breath goes still, my eyes lock in on C1 and C2 and I open my mouth to speak*  \n\n&gt; $Hit - You do not work in our environment on the day to day and have no real grasp of the way things operate. From out outsider's perspective, this ticket looks bad. But that is why we are here as managers to look at this and show you, the outside consultant, why this is perfectly acceptable.  *Sideways glance at me in what I can only assume was a \"stop it.\" glare.*  \n\n&gt; $VPN - How many more tickets do you have like that?  \n\n&gt; $C2 - We pulled out 12 tickets like that where the tech was unable to keep the ticket closed. \n\nThe room goes silent. \n\n&gt; $ME - *My eyes lock in and I exhale slowly.*  \n\n&gt; $VPN - *oblivious* Then skip over those. They are a waste of our time. \n\nThe consultants pulled four tickets to the top. \n\n&gt; $C1 - Here is one that counts. (Name of tech) helped (user) out on March 5, 6, 7, 12, and 22nd, on what looks like an outlook issue.  \n\n&gt; $C2 - Ticket came in on the 4th at right before midnight and got picket up first thing as the tech came in. That is normal. The tech called the user and got voicemail leaving a message. The user called back 2 hours later and the tech was able to figure out the issue was with her account and not email. An old Ipad had her account on it and kept locking her account from automated bad password tries. \n\nHe takes a drink of water. \n\n\n&gt; $c2 - The next day the user responded saying that she only turned the old Ipad on for a second and it auto locked her again. She wanted assistance removing the account from the ipad so it never happened again.  \n\n&gt; $C1 - This was the first instance of the tech failing to keep the ticket closed.  \n\n&gt; $me - *My hands tighten in a very Gendo Ikari like pose*  \n\n&gt; $C2 - The tech cleared the account off the ipad remotely and unlocked the account again letting the user know that her password was set to expire in 16 days. The user said she would change it herself. The next day her manager replied to the ticket opening it again. That was the second instance of the tech failing to keep the ticket closed by the way. Now the manager was just thanking the tech for the help so we wont count that one. However it does help us establish a pattern.  \n\nA message over lync came in from $Hit and $EVPIT. \"The leash has come off.\" I replied with. \"I will let the man finish first.\"\n\n&gt; $c2 - Then on the 12th the user replied back stating it was happening again. The tech split the ticket off as it was a separate issue. Appears to have been a simple citrix login issue as logging out and back in fixed it and that is fine. Look the tech is competent enough he just has a huge issue with a failure to keep his tickets closed.  \n\n&gt; $Me - So... \n\n&gt; $C2 - Wait there is one more for this ticket. On the 22nd of March the user reopened the ticket stating she forgot to change her password and needed help. By the time the tech got to it she had already called the hotline and got it taken care of with another tech. That sounds normal... However. There is a clear progression here of a failure to maintain the tech's ticket queue. There is a clear line of failure from start to finish of being able to keep this ticket closed.  \n\n&gt; $Hit - So If I am understanding you correctly, the issue you want us to address is randomly reopening tickets on the user end?\n\n&gt; $C1 - No. This is a clear failure to keep the tickets closed. *takes off his glasses* You have a real problem with techs failing to keep their tickets closed. \n\n&gt; $Me - So that phrase you just used. \"Failure to keep tickets closed.\" It is a useless metric to track. You understand that right?\n\n&gt; $c2 - I fail to see \n\n&gt; $Me - A rhetorical quesiton when its posed? I wasnt asking. I was telling you... in the form of a question. You see you both know that this is a useless metric to track. You know this. You had to dig to the bottom of the barrel to find a metric to try and let people go. \n\nI take a drink of water and look around the room. $hit is hiding a smile, $EVPIT is smirking on the side of his mouth, and $VPN has a huge grin on her face hidden behind her hands. \n\n&gt; $ME - If you had come to me directly with honest intentions I would have assisted you. I have 4 contractors out there who show up late every day, who have been given warning after warning, and one who I am going to let go no matter what when he gets in cause he cussed out a customer. That would have been 5 for your sacrificial chamber and 5 less headaches I have to deal with. Instead. I am going to give the other 4 a second chance. \n\n&gt; $C1 - *To EVPIT* He is throwing out some wild accusations here and I am formally asking you what you wish to do about this. \n\n&gt; $EVPIT - I stand behind $Me's decision and agree that you have picked a metric that... will not produce favorable results for the company. I feel like I have gained some very valuable information from this meeting. *Looks to me* Anything you wish to say regarding this?\n\n&gt; $Me - No I think you covered it pretty well. I just wanted to add again that we have contractors who are on the final straw. Instead you went over experienced employees with tenure and experience.  We keep the low hanging fruit for a reason if you catch my meaning. \n\n&gt; $C1 - Just so you know our report will go to the CEO and CIO about this. I will personally recommend that the metric of Failing to keep tickets closed be tracked and personally recommend a shake up of the management staff. \n\n&gt; $Me - *points to the camera in the corner* OK. I will recommend he watch the video while reading your report.\n\nThe consultants filed out of the room and quickly left the building. \n\n&gt; $VPN - WHat a bunch of...\n\nI will leave the story to let off there. There was zero fallout from this. The CEO did not care at all as apparently my dept was not the only department to tell off their consultants. The CIO laughed and said he owed me lunch for the laughs I gave him from the video, and I legitimately gave the four consecutively late people a final chance. The guy who cussed out a customer was not even let into the building. He was fired from the front door.",

Boss tells me to only pick up the phone in case of a fire since we can't do much with me being 300 miles away from my tools and whatnot.\n\nYou know where this is going. Phone rings.\n\n&gt;$Rimmer: Hey $Gost, it's me, Rimmer, the new cashier! Just asking, is it normal for the server room to have _an unbearable smell of burnt wire?_ \n\n&gt;$Gost [internally screaming]: Okay, calm down.

I unscrewed the terminals myself and even labeled positive and negative wire!\n\nWhy you... What should I do. While me and Boss chat about what was done and if he would allow him to go further (NO), Rimmer, the man who could not figure basic shapes, colors and reading, _successfully_ replugged them back on the second PSU anyway.\n\nIn the end our technician promises going there tomorrow (he didn't), we asked Rimmer to not endanger himself further (he did), and boss asked me to check if the remaining PSU wasn't being overloaded so it would not set the place ablaze when we were not looking (specs says not, but specs didn't say anything about not spontaneously combusting in flames so no promises).\n\nTL;DR Only Sesame Street can stop office fires.\n\nEdit: Markup.",

Here's the [index!](https://www.reddit.com/r/Savacli/wiki/tales)**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Back Story**  \nWe're at the point where we are really starting to suffer from growing pains. So much so that last year we had to hire a Full Time HR just to keep up with the rate that our company was growing at. Previously, we were small enough to where HR responsibilities were split among two or three people (seminars, choosing benefits, handling internal personnel issues, etc), but it got to be too much.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**The Cast**  \n**$Lulu:** Our manager.  \n**$TK:** Our recently hired Full Time HR. Overall super chill person. Quite the foodie too.  \n**$ExtD:** For all intents and purposes, my work wife.  \n**$Savy:** Yours truly, also avid fan of lemonade.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Process Improvement, eh?**  \n$TK had been killing it over the past couple of months and essentially got a party thrown for her when she massively improved our benefits this year only costing us a mere $2 more than what we were already paying. Needless to say she had won favor with most departments. Thus, the next item on her list was process improvements. First process to get looked at? New Employee On-Boarding.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThis is where I would like to say we have an amazing New Employee On-boarding experience where all of our new guys feel fully equipped and ready to take on the world!...but I would be flat-out lying if I committed to that statement. Thus $TK sat down everyone from Operations as well as the two team leads which in this case was $ExtD and myself. she started off the meeting by going through a couple slides about best-practices, successful on-boarding....yeah, nothing too exciting. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWe were about to pass out when she asked the one question that brought all of our brains in unison:\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt;**$TK:** So, let's say you have a new employee. What is the first thing you would want to tell them about your department's culture? You know, the thing that ties everyone together.  \n&gt;**$Savy/$ExtD:** DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS!!!  \n&gt;**$TK:** *sigh*....why am I not surprised. Well, how are you gonna communicate that to your new employee?  \n&gt;**$ExtD:** Have them do a one-off campaign with $Savy as the DM.  \n&gt;**$Savy:** Isn't the goal to have the new guy LIKE us??  \n&gt;**$Lulu:** *rolling her eyes* Why don't we just buy him some dice or something and put them on his desk?  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n*the heavens open up and a choir of angels sing as an idea forms in Savy's mind*\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt;**$Savy:** ...we make him build a character sheet  \n&gt;**$Lulu:** What the turkey is that?  \n&gt;**$ExtD:** Wait, how do we even do that? 5th edition? Homebrew classes?  \n&gt;**$Savy:** We make up our own sheet. With IT Stats and everything!!!  \n&gt;**$TK:** That's sounds like ~~the worst idea~~ the most creative idea I've heard so far today!  \n&gt;**$Lulu:** That sounds like a lot of work.  \n&gt;**$TK:** It's the only idea that's been brought to the table so far. Going once? Going twice? Sold!  \n&gt;**$Savy:** *(Internal squealing)*  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nFor the next week I worked with $ExtD to come up with a custom IT themed character sheet, and then I had $Lulu proofread it so that even non-techs could fill out the form. Once the sheet was filled out we'd have a general idea of what the new person's skill set and proficiencies are. It was so effective that we even had our currently techs fill our the form as well.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**You can't be serious...**  \nOh, but I am. Apparently, we learned that same meeting that $TK's brother is really big into board games (as big as Gloomhaven), and she was always the go-to party member when her brother puts together game nights. So, not only did she approve the custom character sheet, but she also recommended we do a fun review game at the end of a new employee's first week as well as going out after-hours that day for hangout time (this week is bowling!)!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**TL;DR:** My HR is cooler than your HR because she plays board games.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nEdit: Formatting  \nEdit 2: Check the comments for the character sheet",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/8hzuib/the_tale_of_the_missing_invoices_and_the_wacky/",
        "text": "This is kind of a mashup tale with two customers and two different issues (end impact to business/customer) that had the same root cause that lead to the same moral: Garbage in, Garbage out.\n\nSo I (funtimeswithaix) work for a vendor that provides software to businesses. Our software comes chock-full of different functionalities, some of which are very general, others of which are highly industry specific. In addition to allowing customers to take advantage of our having made and continually patching the parts that were standard, customers had the ability to customize code to better meet their business processes.\n\nOf course, custom code is a thing that can be great, or a nightmare. It depends on your testing, the quality of the code developed itself, and re-testing when you upgrade the system (to make sure that changes in the standard part of the application did not require you to adjust your custom code). The software provides a full toolset to analyze changes that are brought in and identify what parts of custom code need to be adjusted or re-tested, IF you set it up (big if).\n\n**Tale #1: The invoices that weren't**\n\n$customerA manufactures tangible things. They make the things, they box the things, they ship the things, and they sell the things. The company does direct to consumer sales, but it represents a very tiny portion of their business. Most sales are B2B direct and thus selling the items and then invoicing the customer later with 30-90 day payment terms after customer receives invoice is far more common. They use our software for all of the major parts: Finance (including invoicing), warehousing/goods movement, etc...\n\nEnter a few years ago. They are starting to hear from customers that:\n\n1) The customer *did* place an order.\n\n2) The customer never received an invoice.\n\n3) After the payment term periods end, the customer is receiving \"INVOICE OVERDUE\" mail with penalties and threats (cut off from ordering, legal action, etc.) from $companyA accounts receivable.\n\nThe customers are pissed. $customerA is baffled. $customerA asks how this could be. $customerA gets really pushy on this, but we push back because they have used a non-trivial amount of custom code to customize this process and ultimately we agree to a consensus:\n\n1) The software company will conduct a thorough analysis of the problem with sufficient documentation so that the customer and third parties with expertise will be able to understand the problem and fix it.\n\n2) If the problem is due to either a legitimate bug in the standard program, or is at least in part caused by a bug in standard code - we will bear all costs of the analysis and recommendation. If we analyze it and it turns out to be due to issues in custom code, they will bear the cost of the resource's time at the normal billable rate.\n\n(I would note that there are many cases in #2 where it is debatable in at least part that there could be no product defect, so we err on the side of caution and sometimes eat the cost of analyzing/fixing things even when the customer is to blame. The case has to be airtight and irrefutable to the responsible management.)\n\nSure enough, we get in there and analyze the code to find out what's going on.\n\nIn applications that are database driven, the developer is required to make a decision on when to commit to the database. You have to come up with a block of code and decide when it is appropriate to consider everything \"complete\" and then write the database. This is important because if there's some sort of failure or error in the logic, you have to decide when to abort the commit to DB and generate an error, or to commit your changes to the DB.\n\nThe customer split the logic of their invoicing into three parts with separate commits:\n\n1) Generating the actual invoice (in DB and as PDF file).\n\n2) Sending the invoice electronically to the customer.\n\n3) Marking the invoice as having been sent to customer and then thus the clock starts on X days until they're not within payment terms.\n\n\\#2 and #3 should have been together, but were coded separately. Thus, it was possible for the invoice to be successfully made and for the invoice to have been marked as sent to the customer, but due to bad application logic (shoddy input handling) for the invoice to not have actually been sent to the customer. Since this happened in the background and did not happen on every invoice (it happened for a small percentage of them, it became the biggest deal when the \"unlucky\" invoice was for five or more digits and the intended recipient of their invoice lost their shit when they were being told they were late), no error dialog was generated to the end user. The custom code did not adequately log this exception for later review either.\n\n$customerA ate crow at that one (paid for the analysis) and combined their custom invoicing code on points 2 and 3 so the DB commit would not happen unless there was a validated input, improved error handling and reporting, etc.\n\n**Tale #2: What's in a price**\n\n$customerB makes things, but in a different sense: They are a pharmaceutical company. Security is key, compliance (record keeping, security, etc.) is key, when moving goods (particularly making drugs in one country and exporting them to another) having all the paperwork in check is key. This company states they will be not using services of our company as much because they don't see the bang for the buck. In a show of goodwill and to try to win the customer back, I get loaned to this customer for three months free-of-charge (software vendor ate the cost, including travel/lodging to visit the customer at their own office). Like any sufficiently large IT organization, they have problems, and I'm sent there to be the guy to solve them - or at least drive the resolution.\n\nLike many companies, a price is not a price is not a price. It depends on who you are (some organizations have more clout than others, especially single payer governments), it depends on what you're willing to pay, it depends on what your laws are on maximum amount spent/profit, it depends on how much of it you're buying (quantity discounts), etc. - thus the software has complex pricing rules. The customer had customized code on how pricing was processed because at least at one earlier point, the software in standard \"*did not meet their needs*\" (a lot of customers have a weird definition of this that is very different from their peers and does not provide any \"*special sauce*\" of an advantage, but the capability to customize code exists so they can do custom code if they believe in it). This did not affect every customer, it was based on conditional logic (some customers were priced solely in standard vendor code, others used the customer's logic as an extension)\n\nI'm at this customer trying to help them in a variety of areas (fix some stuff while giving them new stuff that helps their business and IT in decision making or having easier lives). John, the head of the customer's developers, approaches me about the pricing issue and pushes for a solution. He is adamant that it is an issue in our standard code and implores for my help, because sending invoices out that have prices listed that don't match the discounts a customer is supposed to get is a HUGE reputation and potential legal issue (customer could be fined or face legal action from their customers, particularly government buyers). To counter this, the customer was applying manual checks on the end invoices - better than nothing, but still subject to error, and something that the program can handle on its own ordinarily.\n\nI engage a lot of help from the software vendor side towards this and we're heads down analyzing the problem. There are a lot of back and forth phone calls, web conferences, emails, and ticket updates. \n\nAfter about a month of this, John comes up to me and offers something unexpected: An unsolicited apology. Throughout the course of the problem he had kept close tabs on it, which was unusual for his position - but he was a former developer of many years before being put in charge of them and deeply technical. Eventually he had sat down with the developers in charge of maintaining that code and asked them to do a walk-through of the application logic during pricing scenarios. He eventually was introduced to one part of the code and blew a gasket.\n\nIn the application, there are database tables that are expected to be tables of record. You commit to these tables and update them based on changes that are finalized. There are also database tables that are intended for the temporary manipulation of data. This is especially important in on-the-fly operations of custom code because if you updated the standard temporary tables, you could cause issues if you did it wrong.\n\nThe software standard code handled this table properly in pricing because those who designed it knew how to do access it and interpret the values in that table. When manipulating the data for a given transaction, the standard code would handle that in memory (ephemeral) and then update the table only when all logic was done. The customer's code modified the values of that table directly as it ran at multiple points. The end result was that if the customer's code was in the process of pricing for a customer that required the custom pricing procedure, if the standard pricing ran for a different invoice at the same time, it would get the invalid mid-manipulation data left in the table by the custom code, and that would cause it to price incorrectly.\n\nJohn bluntly called it \"*an absolute embarrassment*\" and stated that the code would never have passed his audit if he was in his current position at the time it had been reviewed &amp; approved. I thanked John for this (most customers keep silent on their mistakes hoping to quietly fix it or blame the vendor and hope the vendor doesn't notice it. Since he saved us all a lot of time, I just stated that we worked together towards a resolution and fixed the issue (basically, stating the issue was resolved, without explicitly assigning any blame or responsibility). John actually took umbrage towards this and disclosed to his own management that it was their own problem, that he took responsibility for it, and that he worried about \"boy who cried wolf\" syndrome when raising issues with the software vendor in the future. It is something that has happened only a couple times in my career (where the end-user/owner actually took ownership of the issue without it being forced on them).\n\n**tl;dr One customer has custom code that allows for them to consider an invoice \"sent\" to the customer even if the sending of the invoice fails due to bad design/exception handling. Another has bad custom code that causes some $$$ invoices to not be sent out at the agreed upon prices, causing them to face government penalties/fines. Both learn the value of properly vetting their own code.**",

        "text": "Ok fellow TFTSers, this just happened a few hours ago. \n\nSo our hosting service was forced to do an emergency maintenance, and all VPNs were going to be downed for about 2 hours, between 9am and 11am. \n\nThey called us at 8:30, making us aware of the situation and apologizing profusely. Additionally, they have a 5 minute window where they can push us up to a gig of our docs for the meantime. \n\nUpper Management was having a monthly meeting, with the Office Manager giving an 'important' presentation about core values or synergy or some other time waster. \n\nI know that most likely the OM had her docs stored remotely, so I put the host support on hold and call up to the conference room.\n\n2 rings, then hangup. No voicemail. \n\nCall again. \n\nOne ring, hangup, no voicemail. \n\nSo I page on the intercom 'OM please call the IT dept, this is important'. \n\n2 minutes go by, no answer. \n\nSo now 3 minutes left and I run upstairs to the meeting room (the meeting isn't scheduled to go live for another 20 mins or so), and wave down the OM. I was planning to tell her: \"The VPN to our datastore is down, if you need any files We have a 5 minute window to get them for you.\"\n\nShe angrily waves me away and keeps talking to the room. \n\nI slide up next to the podium and this exchange occurs:\n\n_Fhtagnyatta: The VPN..._\n\n_OM: Look, whatever it is it can wait, I'm giving a presentation._\n\n_Fhtagnyatta: The sched..._\n\n_OM: We have a lot of ground to cover so we started early, if you interrupt me again that will be a verbal. Sit down and wait until we have a pause._\n\n_Fhtagnyatta: Fine..._\n\nSo I get my stale donut and lukewarm coffee and sit. \n\nAnd wait. \n\n_Synergy... core values... encapture... life branding..._\n\nAnd wait. \n\nEventually she goes to open her presentation, and lo and behold 'Server not found'. \n\nShe glares angrily at me and waves me up. \n\n_OM: What is going..._\n\n_Fhtagnyatta: The VPN to our datastore is down, if you need any files We have (checks phone) a negative eight minute window to get them for you.._ \n\nOM glares at me like I just stomped on a kitten. \n\nShe sent me away, and I'm scheduled to meet with the president later this afternoon. \n\nI might be without a job because she wouldn't let me say 23 words.  \n\nOf course this is all my fault...\n\n**EDIT: UPDATE** So I just got out of the meeting with the president and it basically boils down to the claim that I 'Did not follow the proper chain of communication'. \n\nThe Office Manager was appointed an assistant yesterday. \n\nMondays are my day off. No memos were emailed, no announcements made. \n\nI explained to the Prez that I was unaware of the change, as the OM had never before been appointed an assistant and no memos were sent out. \n\nPrez's response: we updated the org chart, you have zero excuses. Sign this paper acknowledging that you acted inappropriately and there will be no other repercussions, though I would prefer if you also apologized to OM in person. \n\nApparently I'm expected to check the org chart every morning for changes.\n\nSo I signed the paper, because I'm addicted to sleeping indoors and eating food not from trashcans. \n\nAnd yes, I've been looking for a new job for a few months now, am looking harder because of this. \n\nThanks all for reading my tale of woe, have a better week than me!",

        "text": "**Me**: PFY (jr. systems administrator and support guy) in the Computer Science Department of a large university.  Just learning Perl, and looking for things to parse.\n\n**Boss**: Sr. CS sysadmin, my boss, and effortless genius at solving bureaucratic and people problems.  Disliked the University \"bigwigs\", and bragged with a smile and a chuckle of his \"friends in low places\" all over campus, with whom he often managed to make good things happen despite idiocy from the top.\n\n**UC**: University Computing, the keeper of central computing on campus, and in particular of the master class enrollment database.\n\n**COFs**: Crusty Old Farts, the old COBOL guys in University Computing that maintained the enrollment database mainframe system.  Good-ole-boy buddies with the director of UC, who in turn was always shmoozing the president, VPs, etc. of the university, making the COFs unfireable.  They spent more effort avoiding work than doing it.  (The rest of UC was fine.)\n\n**Scene**: The Great Day of Printing at the start of spring semester, about 20 years ago.\n\nEach semester, on the momentous Great Day of Printing, UC would run a printout for every academic department, covering every class, listing every student that was enrolled.  These massive stacks of wide fanfold printouts would be assembled from the line printers in Central Printing and delivered to each department.  The departments would tear them at class boundaries and give them to the instructors.  Several rainforests were probably devastated by this.\n\nThe CS dept. had thousands of students taking hundreds of classes (or \"sections\" if a given class was offered at multiple times).  I always hated the start of a semester, because for several weeks, Boss and I were inundated with people having trouble logging in to the CS Unix systems.  Some of these were run-of-the-mill PEBKAC issues, but a good chunk boiled down to the stacks of paper from UC.\n\nWhen various people are creating and deleting accounts for thousands of people from printouts, mistakes happen.  Boss and I spent many hours sorting them out each semester.\n\nBoss hated it just as much as I did.  He had worked on the enrollment system years ago and knew there was a better way.  If we could just get that massive report for the CS dept. in a file, instead of a printout, we could write a screengrabber to log into the mainframe, display/download it, parse it, and automatically manage the thousands of accounts.  Boss knew this was easy.  Or, SHOULD be.\n\nOver the course of a couple weeks talking to COFs, punctuated by ignored voicemails, etc, he had this conversation:\n\n&gt; Boss: ... and so we'd like you to run the departmental report to a file instead of the printer.\n\n&gt; COF: That's not possible.\n\n&gt; Boss: Actually, it's easy.  You can do it in 5 minutes... [ explains it to COF ]\n\n&gt; COF: Maybe, but uh, it's also against policy.\n\n&gt; Boss: Against policy?\n\n&gt; COF: You're not allowed to request that report.\n\n&gt; Boss: But I already get that report.  On paper.\n\n&gt; COF: Doesn't matter.  It's a security policy.  But there's a different report you could use.\n\n&gt; Boss: Oh?\n\n&gt; COF: Yes.  The per-class report.  It has the exact same output. &lt;smugly&gt;  All you have to do is put in a request for each class section.\n\nCOF said this with the attitude of \"this excuse has worked for me for 15 years.\"  Because the way you run a report on this system is you telnet to it, go through multiple needlessly complicated screens to put in the request, and then wait for an operator to grab the job from the queue, input (hopefully accurately) the parameters into the program that actually runs the report, and then you wander on down to Central Printing to pick it up in a few days (or log back on to the system to see if you have a print dump waiting).  Only a very stupid person would do this hundreds of times, because it would take days.\n\n... unless, that is, you have a green and keen PFY (me), freshly minted in the ways of Perl, eager to tackle a parsing and screenscraping job over summer.  So I worked up programs to telnet to the mainframe, automatically submit the hundreds of requests, download the results, and do the right thing to the Unix accounts.\n\n**Finally fall semester arrived** and it was time to try out my code for real.\n\nOn the first day of class, in the space of about 2 minutes, UC's operators received several hundred requests for enrollment data from us.  They had to manually approve, run, and save the report for each one.  Since we automated and they didn't, that which took us 2 minutes took them all day.  And, for the first time in ages, we weren't dealing with so many account problems!\n\n**One week later**: with a twinkle in his eye and a smile on his face, Boss says, \"We have a lot of people add or drop classes in the first few weeks.  We need to do this every week for the first month of class.\"  Which was true.  So, off go several hundred more requests.\n\n**Another week later**: Boss had an even bigger grin when he said, \"They've complained about me to the department chair!  He asked them if they would let us use the proper report yet.  They still said no.  Let's run the script again!\"  Several hundred more requests sent out.\n\nBy spring semester, we had access to the proper report.\n\nBoss's old friend, an insider in the trenches at University Computing (not a COF) later stopped by and said, \"Do you know how many high-up people in the university have asked for this for 10 years?  You're a sysadmin and you got what deans couldn't.\"\n\nBoss's reply: \"Never underestimate a system administrator that knows how to code.\"\n\n***\n\n**Epilogue**: I only worked there a couple years, but Boss had become a good friend and mentor.  For more than 20 years, up until his last day on the job earlier this year, his desk was in the exact same spot it had always been.  Multiple reorganizations had happened, CS got meshed up with other departments, people were moved all over campus, and he even got transferred to a completely unrelated department.  On paper, anyway.  But somehow, somehow... he just...  didn't move.  He kept his office, right in the middle of the CS department that he loved.  He even managed to keep most of his CS job duties (which he also mostly enjoyed).  Even though he supposedly hadn't worked for them for over 10 years.\n\nThis is just one of many fond memories of The Boss.  I will miss dropping by every so often and having a good laugh about the old times.\n",

Forgive me if there are some mistakes, english is not my native language.\n\nI heard this old tale at my previous job and it's now dating a few years back. It was a modest size IT business with no real sense of what managing a bunch of customers' infrastructures would mean but we'll get to that eventually.\n\nThere was this business who would keep loosing network connection in the whole building for a few minutes, each day, at roughly the exact same time of the day. A quick word about the company : they managed financial operations, roughly 20 workers with about half in individual offices.\n\nAfter several rounds of \"remote diagnostic -&gt; on site diagnostic -&gt; corrective measures -&gt; wait and see -&gt; rinse and repeat\" the tech guy in charge of the problem got reeeeaaaally angry and decided to spend the whole day on site to try and corner the fault.\n\nIt took him two days to find the problem. See, they were all working on a token ring network and each and everyday, at roughly the same time, one of the employees (let's call her Arabica) had the same ritual.\n\nShe got up from her chair, turned her screen off, obviously thinking it would turn the computer off, then proceded to unplug the power-strip and plug her personal coffee machine and prepare herself her traditional afternoon drink. Arabica would then unplug the coffee machine, plug back the power strip and startup her computer, utterly oblivious to the fact that she had just cut the business' whole network for a few minutes.\n\nWhen confronted with the problem, her only answer was : \n&gt;\"But everything was fine! I don't need the network at that time, i'm drinking my coffee!\"\n\nSuffice to say my colleague was not pleased and the whole business got a networking 101 lesson.\n\nI always keep this story in mind when I begin to have too much faith in the end-user.\n",

        "text": "#Intro\n\nSome time ago at a previous assignment I was in a team of 10 people supporting 1st line IT needs of a user base of 2500 users in a colossal international company $BlackSugaryLiquid. Our team was efficient and structured and led by a competent young lady $MissBoss. We would handle all sorts of office and production related IT problems and would resolve quite a lot of them ourselves. Some of our tickets we would have to escalate to back line teams, who would in turn kick it back to us when they had a solution. $BlackSugaryLiquid, while having lots of sites in different countries, had the habit of outsourcing key IT components to the South of the Himalayas ($HCL henceforth) and other low wages countries. This was met with much frustration of everyone within IT and outside of IT, since you receive the quality for which you pay.\n\nI write this from memory so details I no longer remember could be left out\n\n#Red Dawn\n\nThe entirety of $Finance was handled by an office in such a low wages country. They utilized a third rate ticketing system called $Tool where incoming emails were automatically converted into a ticket, complete with content and attachments. Surely such a system would have multiple fail safe's and other filters to protect it from harm, right? Most of you might see where this is going.\n\nOne glorious morning a malicious email arrives at $Finance and, being a well programmed piece of technology, $Tool happily converts this email into a ticket without any form of safety check, together with the mandatory suspicious attachment.  A poor unsuspecting woman of $Finance opened the ticket as well as the attachment inside. While she was confused and dumbfounded at the random crap that was inside of this ticket, her PC got infected with $Crypto and it started doing its thing. $Crypto had the tendency to not only encrypt things locally on your computer but was also able to see your mapped network drives and work from there. \n\nWithin minutes it was multiplying on $Financeshare located on an important dataserver who also hosted other shares, devouring all the Financial data as well as other extremely important documents belonging to all the offices in Europe. After about one hour later we get a call that some files on $Financeshare look weird and cannot be opened and if we could be so kind to take a look. The agent who took the call informed $Missboss immediately when he verified the files and made sure the Apocalypse had arrived. Standard protocol was to inform $ITsecurity through email; they did not have a phone number (Yes, I groaned as well, bear with me). \n\nNo one knew who was on this team since it was part of $HCL so we had no way of getting in contact with them, nor get this ball rolling faster. Nonetheless a high prio ticket was opened and cast into the chaos that is $BlackSugaryLiquid’s ticketingsystem (not to be confused with $Tool), filled to the brim with billions of backline teams. No $HCL team could be assigned to this ticket since we did not have a contact. A second email was send 30 minutes after the first, and from there every half an hour once again. Meanwhile a legion of Incident Managers was scrambling to get this resolved but with no one to turn their wrath too they barked without purpose. $Bigboss and even *$BiggerBoss** were called and informed and they too stood powerless against the nothingness. $BlackSugaryLiquid no longer resembled a company, it was a circus where the actors are on fire and we were  chained to our first row seats, condemned to watch this to the bitter end.\n\nIn the meanwhile $Crypto was chugging along, feasting on precious data and files.  \n\nAfter 6 full hours after our first call we finally got response from $ITsecurity:\n\n&gt;“Thank you for your email. We will look into the issue”\n\nThis well thought out response harvested a Mexican wave of raised eyebrows and other less civilized human expressions, but at least we had made contact AND we had a name. The legion that consisted of Incident managers and $Bigbosses got to work after hours of watching paint dry and the blitzkrieg of $Crypto was finally halted. The server of $Financeshare got taken of the network (8 hours after infection), smaller fires caused by $Crypto left and right were stomped out. To prevent the backup system from taking a backup from an infected server it was shut down and the last healthy backup was eventually restored. $ITsecurity was being manhandled in a negative way and put into place (or so we thought).\n\nIn total it took about 12 complete hours from start to finish. This does not include the aftermath of meetings and reformed SLA’s.\n\n**Surely an event of these proportions could not happen again with these countermeasures?**\n\nPS: Text markup experts may always give suggestions\n\nEdit: [Part 2 is up](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/8jbj87/we_did_not_do_it_because_no_one_told_us_to_part_2/)",

The call comes in as \"No Contract/T&amp;M\" or Time &amp; Materials.  This was highly unusual because at the time my billing rate was $235/hr with a 4 hour minimum.

The man is just a tiny teeny bit paranoid about our competition trying to get our juicy software dismantled and revealing all his hacks. And, gods forbid, implementing them themselves.\n\nNow, for better or worse, I finally found a company which I am happy with doing my apprenticeship as a qualified IT specialist. Since I am the first person to do so, my $boss is pretty chilled and a nice dude all around \\(also younger than me...\\), helps out if I have any problems at all, keeps explaining the architecture of our software and so on. Additionally, I am not the only one they took on \\- I've got two colleagues who started right after me.\n\nAfter having gone through the basic processes, $boss explained to me what my new work would be: migration of our software to a newer \\(architecture\\) framework. Problem is, we're jumping one version inbetween, and let's just say that quite a lot happened from our old to this in\\-between version... and now we're even going one step further. While doing so, a lot of stuff got broken, we're trying to keep a lid on it, but still: fixing bugs AND testing while being on a deadline is no fun at all.\n\nCue $sweet16, so called since this newly hired apprentice is just 16 years old.

Trying to open zip ties with a butter knife when we have perfectly good scissors right next to him, than waving it around almost maiming me in the process... he has a lot to learn.\n\nBut then $boss had the brilliant idea.\n\n&gt;$boss: Hey, $sweet16, got a job for you.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$sweet16: Hm?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$boss: Here's the link to our test environment. Take a shot at it and break it.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$sweet16: Okay.\n\nAbout five minutes and a lot of clicking sounds later:\n\n&gt;$sweet16: Done.\n\nTo this day, I have no idea what and how he did it. But in these five minutes, he found about 20 bugs me and $boss just had overlooked, wrote a ticket for each and every one of them AND crashed the whole test server \\- database, webserver, EVERYTHING \\- with one single input.\n\nThis continued for the next two weeks, with me trying to keep up bugfixing while the clicking sounds almost drove me nuts. $sweet16 found bugs I'd never even think about. One was discovered by having over twenty tabs open in his browser, canceling the user account, than trying to open a menu item in another tab while still \"being\" that user and acutally being refered to another user completely. We had some fun digging into this one, and the craziest part is that it *only happened when having 20\\+ tabs open in the browser.*\n\nSo, here's to all those computer gnomes in QA who happily click away and try to destroy everything I so hard worked for, and most of the times succeed in doing so. Thanks, guys and gals. Life would be a lot tougher without you.\n\nTL,DR: All hail QA!",

        "text": "A while back, I was hired to do some editorial work.  This is different than IT support, because I know how to do editorial work, and have only a general understanding of IT.  On my first day there, one of the office staff was showing me how when I finished a job, I had to put it into their billing spreadsheet.  \"And if it's a client we don't have a record for, you should put in a new row, only make sure you get it in the right place alphabetically, because otherwise we're going to miss it.\"\n\nShe was a nice lady who seemed competent, and it was literally my first day, so I figured I was probably missing something.  But I decided to go out on a limb, and ask why they weren't just sorting their spreadsheet by last name, rather than hand alphabetizing. \n\nIt was like I had stolen fire from the gods and brought it down to their office.  Amazing!  It was going to make it so much easier for them to sort things properly!\n\nAt this point, I asked about the calculator that the lady had next to her computer.\n\n\"It's for the billing,\" she explained.  \"We put the amount we're charging for each job into the cells at the end of the line here, and then I have to add it up with the calculator to get the total amount we're billing them.\"\n\nI was a little afraid that her head would actually explode once she realized the potential in being able to add up columns right there in her spreadsheet without needing additional equipment.\n\nMostly I worked remotely, because that office was two hours away by transit.  But after I showed her how Excel could be of assistance in that task as well, I had so firmly established my reputation as a tech wizard that they'd call me in when they had other problems.  In order to overcome such technological difficulties as the printer not working (I cleared a paper jam) and the internet being down (I plugged the phone plug back into the jack) they paid me twenty dollars an hour to ride on trains.",

Story Time.\nPrimary Characters: Myself, SalesForce1, SITBricks, and Overboss.\n\nSo my company runs a morning meeting on Mondays to get everyone caught up on the last weeks issues and to highlight the coming weeks issues. I am fine with this because its an extra hour of pay to sit their and listen to people talk about the work I have to do.\nThey mention that we have picked up a new big contract for a site that has not had any sort of real IT before and we are going to be giving them their first network. \n\nThis is problematic to me since were primarily not an IT company but I figure that SITBricks may for once have some useful abilities IT wise and I won't have to carry the workload for my two man team. Maybe even finish something I'm trying to do to our server at the office.\nThen I get asked to stay for the after meeting by Overboss and all my NOPE senses start screaming that a very large buck is about to be passed. Sit my butt back down and start to plan how much Caffeine I can safely consume to try and get my workload for the week done by Tuesday or Wednesday so that I can devote two days to what ever mess I'm getting. \n\nSalesForce1: \" So Dead we are going to have you do the Domain controller deployment for Big Company because you have experience 'INTERNAL EMPTY WAIL' because you have done this sort of thing before and SITBricks will learn.\" \nDeadTechHead: \" Ah so have we gotten user account information for BIG COMPANY yet?\"\nSITBricks: \" Well no I don't really know what info we need so I was hoping you could show me.\"\nDeadTechHead: \"Ah, so we are doing this install in 3 weeks right?\"\nSalesForce1: \" Actually we moved it up because they are really eager to get some real tech support.\"\nDeadTechHead: \" Did they mention why?\"\nOverboss: \" Does it matter?\"\nDeadTechHead: \" Well yes we need to know exactly what they expect to get out of getting this service through us. We dont want a repeat of COMPANY_TRAGEDY.\"\nOverboss: \" But you can make a domain server? Right?\"\nDeadTechHead: \" I can make a generic Domain/File server no problem but depending on the expectations and access levels needed by users this is going to have to have more effort...\"\nSITBricks: \" Don't worry OverBoss we can get this done.\"\nSalesForce1: \" I knew we could count on you SITBricks!\"\n\nWe escape and I make my way down to the Fridge next to my crying cave which they so recently renovated to include a desk for SITBricks. Wishing I was still working government contracts because nothing their moves this fast without 15 stamps of approval meaning I can stop it before it roles over me. Only to be ambushed by SITBricks: \" So what can I do to help get this done?\" \n\nBecause apparently outside the meetings with people who need to be told to slow there roll I'm the lead. Right. Ok.\n\nDeadTechHead: \" I need a full list of user accounts and services for the company, A list of file locations and hierarchies for the current network and where they are going in the new scheme, and the hardware specifications you left me out of for planning 3 weeks ago.\"\n\nSITBricks:\" What does all that entail?\"\n\n...Sigh...",

Boss says new system doesn't work and $PT has to come back out to fix it.  $DC was not working the day the system was first installed.\n\nVisit 1:  $PT attempts to load something from 3.5\" floppy drive, met by failure of some kind.  After multiple attempts and poking around inside the server, $PT announces that the floppy drive is bad, and they will return with a new one soon.\n\nVisit 2:  $PT installs a new floppy drive.  Still unable to load service disk.  More repeat attempts and mild cursing by $PT, followed by ruling that the initial bad floppy drive must have caused a failure in the motherboard floppy disk controller.  $PT will return with new motherboard.\n\nVisit 3:  $PT installs new motherboard.  Still unable to load service disk.  At this point I strongly suspect $PT is 100% making this up as he goes along.

Still unable to load service disk.  It may have been my imagination, but at this point $PT looks like he wasn't to sit in the corner and cry.

        "text": "The alarm sang on my nightstand, dragging me kicking and screaming yet again to wakefulness, though this time was scheduled.  Sprout (Short for Brussels Sprout, courtesy of Mrs. Wulf—I actually can’t stand the things) was only a handful of months old and sleep was not something he felt mattered and ensured we knew this.  Repeatedly.  Throughout the night.  Every night.\n\nI quietly went about my business, packing my lunch, prepping for work while keeping all the lights out—Sprout had finally slept, and I didn’t want to risk waking him.  Slipping my shoes on in the darkness, I quietly left, climbed into my car and drove to work.  \n\n***\n&gt;**ZeeWulf**  “So, today’s the day, eh?  Why’d you bring yours?”\n\n&gt;**MechanicBob**  “Yup!  The guys from Training wanted me to follow them and take video.”\n\nI watched, totally captivated, as he activated his little MagicPro Quadcopter Drone which took up station about ten feet over our heads and just off the left wing of one of our planes.  Two techs worked around a larger drone which was surrounded by a halo of foam, while a third tested the raspberry pi control boards mounted on the drone itself.  Two more of varying size sat on the table, silent and watching.  \n\nThe techs in question were a small group of developers out of Ukraine and what they’d brought to our hangar was a proof-of-concept inspection drone. In aviation, lightning strikes are a big deal—they eat time and money just from the tedious inspections required alone, not to mention the various repairs they incur.  A lightning strike inspection requires on average four personnel for a smaller aircraft and a multitude more for larger if you want to complete it in any sort of acceptable time limit.  Those people inspecting the plane have to examine every inch of the fuselage searching for little scorch marks or micro-welds on rivets that would indicate static discharge from lightning in addition to the more obvious damage.  \n\nThe idea behind the drone was to be able to set up this drone, tell it what kind of plane it was scanning and then push the **GO** button.  It would fly around the aircraft taking video of every inch while an analysis algorithm would scan the video for signs of damage.  It would be a huge workforce multiplier, freeing up mechanics and inspectors to actually work on aircraft by allowing only one person to inspect the aircraft.  \n\nProblem was, in this case, it was *very* unproven technology.  Testing required an actual aircraft to test the drone with, but the idea of letting an unproven autopiloted drone fly around a multi-million dollar aircraft was not for the weak.  This is why they’d come to us—as $AviationCompany isn’t exactly small a drone-strike on the test aircraft wouldn’t impact us nearly as hard.  Furthermore, if we could get in on this technology at the ground floor it would be a game-changer for the industry and put us ahead of the competition yet again.  \n\nBut all the same, we wanted to avoid any sort of damage to our aircraft on the principle of the matter.  Thus, the extremely controlled nature of the tests.  They had spent the past week testing the system in an empty hangar bay and today was the first and only day they’d have access to a plane.\n\nThe Ukrainian team had set up RFID markers around the aircraft, defining its size and shape to the drone controller.  Everything had been input and MechanicBob’s MagicPro was under his manual control and observing the whole test, recording with its high-quality gimbal-mounted camera.  \n\n&gt;**DroneManager** “Okay, are we ready to test?”\n\nThe three Ukrainians nodded and gave their approval.  \n\nThey had programmed a flight path into the smaller-non-foam-shrouded test drone’s navigation system and as soon as one tech had deposited the quadcopter at the start point the tech running the controls hit the *execute* command.  The drone leapt into the air and hovered for a moment, before suddenly deviating from the flight path and instead heading straight for the engine inlet at growing speed.  The tech hit the safety cutoff and the drone dropped like a string had been cut, shattering across the hangar floor.  \n\nI winced and looked over at DroneManager.  \n\n&gt;**ZeeWulf** “That’s gotta hurt.”\n\n&gt;**DroneManager** “Naw, it’ll be fine.”\n\nThe techs gathered up the piece of their bird and out came zip ties and fresh tape—the drone was reassembled in minutes and the controlling tech was pouring through his code, searching for what had gone wrong.  Over the next couple hours this scene would repeat itself, to include with the larger foam-wrapped concept drone. It turns out the navigation system was made to look at the hangar ceiling to gain its bearings, but there was so much depth and shadow up there the system couldn’t make heads or tails of it.  From what I understand, they never did make it work.\n\nMechanicBob, meanwhile, brought his own drone back to the table and landed it precisely from where it had taken off from.  I stepped over to look at it, and as I looked down I groaned in exhaustion.  It turns out in the dark entryway that morning, I’d slipped onto my left foot a dress shoe to match the slacks and polo I was wearing and onto my right a tennis shoe.  And I never noticed the difference in feel, as Sprout had tired me out.  \n\nMrs. Wulf was, needless to say, greatly amused when I got home as she passed me Sprout to watch while she slipped off to get some much-needed sleep.    \n\nI still want that little drone that MechanicBob had, though...\n\n***\n\n**TLDR** Do drones dream of electric birds?  Do new parents dream?\n\n***\n\n*Amused?  Here are some [more stories](https://redd.it/7i0esb) to fill your time!*",

He had lost track of time and stayed up all night (again) playing his favorite game, EverQuest. After stopping in the IT kitchen for ~~the glorious nectar of IT~~ coffee, he sat at his desk, rubbed his bleary eyes, and started going through his queue.\nLuckily most of the day consisted of small reporting issues that could be fixed without direct human interaction, and only sending the occasional email of “Try it now.” Throughout the day, $Sup1 and a $Peer kept walking back and forth through the office, with their voices escalating as the day progressed. Deciding to not voluntarily get involved, $Selben avoided eye contact.\n\nTowards the end of his shift, $Selben felt a presence standing close behind, and realized his uneventful day was about to be interrupted. He slowly rotated his chair to find $Sup1 looking angry, and $Peer staring at the ground.\n\n\n&gt; $Sup1: Tell him!\n\n&gt; $Peer: Uh, well… A user couldn’t connect to the WIFI.\n\n&gt; $Selben: Okay, and?\n\n&gt; $Peer: He was at home and I… Well, I walked him through un-installing the driver, except I forgot to have him download the new one first.\n\n&gt; $Selben: Can he connect to the wired network?\n\n&gt; $Sup1: No! He’s on the road. That’s totally unacceptable!\n\n&gt; $Selben: Well, when he gets somewhere else we can work with him then.\n\n\n$Sup1 grinned ~~evilly~~ happily.\n\n\n&gt; $Sup1: YOU will meet him at the airport to work on the laptop!\n\n\n$Sup1 looked very pleased with himself for this plan.\n\n\n&gt; $Selben: Who is it?\n\n&gt; $Sup1: It’s $VP!\n\n\nArmed with minimal information about the actual laptop in question, $Selben downloaded drivers for nearly every machine the company used before driving two hours through heavy traffic to get to the airport. $Sup1 had arranged for them to meet just outside the security gates at the airport. $Selben dozed off and on in his seat while waiting for the (of course) delayed flight. He had been up for at least 27 hours by the time he spotted $VP.\n\n\n&gt; $Selben: Hi, I’m here from $Company to work on your WIFI issue.\n\n&gt; $VP: Great, this has been such a pain. I think it started after I switched to this new internet web page. You know all about those internet pages, right?\n\n&gt; $Selben: Uh, sure.\n\n\n$Selben just smiled and patiently waited for $VP to pull out his laptop as he rambled about “those internet web pages.” He pulled out his own machine, to see if there was a connection at the airport, just in case he needed one of the few drivers he didn’t download. He slowly turned to see $VP staring over his shoulder.\n\n\n&gt; $VP: Now what?\n\n$Selben’s eye twitched slightly. Lack of sleep was catching up with him, dangerously affecting his patience.\n\n&gt; $Selben: Your laptop?\n\n&gt; $VP: What about it?\n\n&gt; $Selben: Can you get it out?\n\n&gt; $VP: Out of where? My house?\n\n\n\n\nIt turned out to be a complete waste. $VP had left his computer back at his home and somehow assumed IT would be able to work on it. Why he agreed to meet $Selben at the airport to work on it, no one ever figured out. A few days later, they were able to get $VP to use a wired connection and get remotely connected. The issue was fixed within 30 seconds.",

        "text": "Let me regale you with one of the times I applied the tech support mindset out in the wild, and fixed a problem 8 years in the making. TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSet your time machines to back when emo was still new, and if you were cool, you *had* to have a MySpace page. \\(Man, that Top 8 caused a lot of drama...\\)\n\nI was in college, taking a class on practical film lighting. Every week, as a class, we'd have to go up another floor and each grab a giant lighting kit. These kits had a few different lamp types, along with stands, colour tint sheets, etc. Keep in mind, this was before LEDs were powerful and cheap enough, so all of these were old industrial incandescent bulbs that weighed a ton and were **hot**. Number #1 safety rule: If the light falls, DO NOT TRY AND CATCH IT. You'll lose a hand. Really.\n\nIn this story, I'm CC, and lighting prof is, well, $LightingProf.\n\nDuring our first class, we're all sitting in the studio space. $LightingProf is giving us a lecture about lighting theory \\(I knew it already and had stopped paying much attention after the safety briefing\\). My wandering eyes look up, and notice a FULLY INSTALLED LIGHTING GRID. Around 25 lights, with a few different types, colour tints, and it looked to be motorized.\n\nCue raising of hand.\n\n&gt;**CC:** \"Um, $Prof?\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**$LightingProf:** \"Yes?\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**CC:** *points upwards* \"Is that a full lighting grid?\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**$LightingProf:** \"Yes, it is.\"\n\n30\\+ students all look up, then down at the prof again. I know a few of them want to ask, but it's the first class. $LightingProf doesn't volunteer any information. I sigh and raise my hand again.\n\n&gt;**CC:** \"Could we use that instead of these lighting kits we keep having to bring down from A/V rental?\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**$LightingProf:** \"Well, we could. But the lighting panel is buggy, so it doesn't really work. This way is easier.\"\n\nHe then chuckles. This is funny, you see. I see where he's coming from, but now I'm curious. No, actually, now I'm ***curious***. \\(Danger, Will Robinson!\\)\n\nNext class rolls around, we all grab our gear from the second floor \\(many, many stairs\\), have our next class. I'm itching to touch that lighting board. It's sitting right over there. But it's only the second class, and the opportunity just isn't there.\n\nThird class. We all grab our gear. People are starting to loathe the class because of this. We show up. $LightingProf isn't there. 20 minutes pass. $LightingProf still isn't there. Some people leave, the rest start chatting amongst themselves. No one thinks to go ask the administration.\n\nI see my chance.\n\nI walk up to the lighting board. Turn it on. Start testing the sliders assigned for individual lights. Three lights go on. Then five. Then two. Then ten. Some overlap, but not all. And these are sliders meant for individual lights. They aren't by zone, or by colour. There's absolutely no logic to it.\n\nA few students have drifted by, and offer suggestions. They're intrigued by how non\\-sensical the board is being.\n\nThen, $LightingProf shows up. He makes a beeline for our gathering around the board.\n\n&gt;**$LightingProf:** \"**WHAT ARE YOU DOING?**\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\*students scatter\\*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**CC:** \"Well, you said the lighting board was buggy. I wanted to see if I could fix it.\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**$LightinProf:** \"Kid, we've got industry professionals on staff, and several of them have taken a look at it and can't fix it. You won't be able to.\"\n\n***Curiosity*** changes to ***Wanna bet?***\n\n&gt;**CC:** \"Okay. Well, it's unusable now. Mind if I keep trying?\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**$LightingProf:** \"Sure, whatever. It's your class time. If you miss any material, it's your fault.\"\n\nWhich would have had more an impact if he hadn't shown up 45 minutes into a 70 minute class. But I have my permission. And I'm angry in the way only an 18 year old can be at authority. Let's do this.\n\nYou see, I hadn't just been hitting sliders and buttons randomly. I was testing. Methodically. This lighting board was programmable, and it seemed like someone had programmed a bunch of the sliders very strangely. \\(These are called \"scenes\", or at least they are when done properly\\) Or multiple people had done so. I could figure out what all the programmed scenes were \\(what lights were with what, etcetera\\), or...\n\nThe board had a small alphanumeric display and a menu button. I hit it.\n\n**Enter 4\\-digit code**.\n\nThere's no way the prof will give it to me, even if he knew it, which I seriously doubt. I think back to what I've read about schools, common passwords, etc. What's the number of this classroom? Yup, four digits. Right.\n\n**Incorrect. Enter 4\\-digit code.**\n\nShrug, plug the classroom number in reverse. Boom.\n\nI cycle through the menus quickly, see a few interesting ones. Find the one about programmable scenes. Cycle through that. There are... a lot. I nope out of that submenu. Keep cycling. Ah, here we go.\n\n**Warning: This will reset your board to factory defaults. Proceed?**\n\nOh, hell yes.\n\nThe board clears, turns off, then on again. The sliders all go down of their own accord \\(they were also motorized, had no idea\\). Each of the grid lights then fades up and down once as the board tests. Students are now looking up and around, and $LightingProf is looking straight at me with suspicion. I'm just \\(literally\\) watching the light show.\n\nThe lights finish cycling through their test and turn off. I look back at the board, it looks at me, innocent as you please. I bring up fader #1. Light #1 comes up. Fade #2. Light #2 comes up. I do the same for the next 5. They all come up individually.\n\nThe class has broken down into badly whispered gossiping. $LigthingProf comes over.\n\n&gt;**$LightingProf:** \"You got it working. Go sit down.\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**CC:** \"No. I haven't tested all of the lights, yet. I don't know if it's *really* working.\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**$LightingProf:** \\*grumbles and goes back to the gaggle of students\\*\n\nFor the next twenty minutes, I painstakingly \\(ie way slower than needed\\) test every single light. I made sure to test some of them multiple times, just to make sure. The fact that they were the ones pointed at $LightingProf \\(nothing directly in his eyes\\) was a pure coincidence. Honest. The students had a really hard time concentrating on his lecture as pot lights kept coming on and off, shining off his shiny shaved head. Finally, I pushed my testing as much as I thought I could and joined the rest of the class.\n\nOh, but dear reader, we're not done.\n\nLater in the day, I'm in another class, when three different $FilmDepartment professors burst into my $CompSci lab in the middle of a lecture. They go right to the $CompSci prof, in what looks like a panic.\n\n&gt;**$FilmProf2:** \"Is CC in this class? Which one is he?\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**$CompSciProf:** \"Uh, yes? He's over there.\"\n\nAll three \\(none of them are the $LightingProf\\) rush over.\n\n&gt;**$FilmProf2:** \"Did you fix the lighting board in $Room?\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**CC:** \"Uh, yeah. I just reset it to factory defaults.\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;All three of their faces go white.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**$FilmProf3:** \"What? Why didn't anyone think of that?\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**$FilmProf1:** \"I can't believe it. Thank you!\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**$FilmProf2:** \"That was really smart. I'm glad you worked with $LightingProf to get that working.\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**CC:** \"Oh, I didn't. That was on my own. He didn't want me touching it, and got angry when I fixed it.\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**$FilmProf2:** \"...I see. Well, thank you.\"\n\nThey left. $CompSci prof looked at me for an explanation, I just shrugged, class continued.\n\nNext lighting class, we were told we didn't have to check out lighting kits anymore and the department had fixed the lighting board, so we'd be using that going forward. Cue grateful sighs from the class, and dirty looks to $LightingProf from everyone, as they knew exactly who had fixed it, and it wasn't staff.\n\n$LightingProf spent the rest of the semester refusing to look at me and giving me the passive aggressive treatment. I gave absolutely no f\\*\\*\\*s.\n\n**TL;DR:** I fixed a lighting board that had been broken for 8 years by walking over, guessing the admin code and hitting *Reset to Factory Default*, while my professor looked on in ever\\-increasing impotent rage. It was glorious.\n\n*Edit:* Fixed formatting... Also, some numbers.\n\n*Edit2:* Sorry guys, I really don’t know what model or brand the lighting board was. ~15 years is a long time.  \n\n**Next time:** When I fixed an entire school district's network. Only because I broke it.",

        "text": "So I work for a web development company and we have a fair few clients. This client in question, however, is one of our higher-maintenance clients, still very lovely of course but they  require a lot of running around after with a fire extinguisher.\n\nWe actually didn't build their site, they came to us asking for help because their previous developers dropped support for them, goodness knows why!\n\nA lot of stuff is wrong with it but they have a limited budget so we can't fix it all at once, even though we're getting through a lot of the issues, some still remain, so without further ado, on with the tale!\n\n&gt; Client on the phone: Hello the site is down please can you fix it immediately?\n\n&gt; Me: of course, what's the error?\n\n&gt; Client: it's just a blank page\n\n\nI log onto the server and notice that the site isn't down \n\n&gt; Me: it seems fine from here, what page are you trying to view?\n\n&gt; Client: I'll email you the link...\n\nI get the link and notice that the page is indeed broken, and it's being caused by a null reference exception.\n\nThe way this page works, is it takes several images from children pages and displays them. If you don't want an image to show, you need to go onto the child page and remove the image there. This client has developed a lovely habit of going to the media library and removing the images from there which doesn't update the content pages, and because the image doesn't exist anymore, a null reference exception occurs!\n\nI explain this on the phone to our client.\n\n&gt;Client: well is there no way to solve this?\n\n&gt;Me: yes you need to go to the child page first and remove the image there before deleting it from the media library\n\n&gt;Client: that seems stupid, it should automatically know when I delete it and do it for me\n\n&gt;Me: yeah that would be useful! I'll see if we can schedule some time in to work on a tool that does that for you, I reckon it'll be about two or three days of work though, should I start planning?\n\n&gt;Client: oh no that's far too long, we can't afford that, but the system should do it automatically\n\n&gt;Me [internally]: well too bad, it doesn't so what now?\n\nWe explain to our client that they must must must remove the images from the child pages before removing them from the media library on the phone and in a follow up email.\n\nThe next day the client phones up with the same issue and we go through the same steps to explain the problem and the workaround.\n\nThen the next week, the client calls with the SAME issue! The same diagnostics occur and the same brief is given to the client.\n\nThen three more times over the next month, each time we're told the cost to implement a fix is too great and that the system should just do it.\n\nAnd now I've just finished fixing the issue again and came here to write this! Soon there'll be a palm-shaped indentation in my forehead! \n\nWe don't charge to fix this as all the client has to do is get the image back out of the recycle bin, but it's just really funny how often this happens when they have been told a hundred times how to avoid it!\n\nHope my formatting is alright and I hope you all enjoy the story :)\n\nedit: to the people pointing out that it costs us to fix it every time it happens, we just tell the client to restore the image from the bin, we don't actually do anything\n\nfurther edit for clarification: they are paying us a lot of money for other work we're doing, we're technically _losing_ money on this issue as you have all pointed out, but, we figure it's better to keep them sweet than cause a fuss over the £50-100 it's cost us so far. A strong relationship with this client is a lot more valuable than billing for a few minutes on the phone :)",

The vendor in question handled a niche product, like orthotic shoes or prescription lenses. For the story's sake, I'll call them 'MedShoeVision'. In addition to verification that the product or service was justified under the various insured's plans, they also shipped products to customers or contracted with medical personnel for discount plans. They held a lot of healthcare data for such a small company and my employer was concerned.\n\n  \n\nMedShoeVision operated out of a 'med-tech incubator', shared office space in an urban hospital with excess capacity. I had to dodge patients in gurneys, medical staff and the like to find MedShoeVision's offices.  \n\n  \n\nOur meeting room was originally built as an examination room- the cabinets were still in place, with a small table wedged uncomfortably in the corner. I'm working with one IT security staffer and a compliance person from MedShoeVision along with one of the compliance lawyers from my client, Large Health Insurer. In another corner is a running PC, with some medical practice software open on the screen.  \n\n  \n\nTwo hard drives, not in cases or even sleds are connected via SATA ribbon cables and are resting on the top of the case. Blinky lights tell me they're live.   \n\n    \n\n  \n\nThese reviews are often a guided conversation around how the vendor does things and whether or not they worry us. They've seen the questionnaire so I'm focusing on answers I don't like and answers I'm not sure of. They're pretty together, but every so often,  I'll focus on this PC of horrors and kind of blank out. Eventually the IT security person notices my divided attention.  \n\n  \n\nIT Security guy:\"Is there a problem?\"  \n\n  \n\nme(pointing at the PC that shouldn't be):\"Well, what the hell is that?\"  \n\n  \n\nI see the IT security guy deflate. He sighs and says:\"I've told the hospital people multiple times that this is a problem and they just shrug their shoulders\"  \n\n  \n\nme:\"As long as it isn't yours, I'll give you a pass just to stop looking at it\"  \n\n  \n\nIT Security guy:\"I'll take that deal\"  \n  \nI was driving home ten minutes later.   \n\n  ",

When I took the replacement machine \\(a newer retired fleet refurb with win 7\\) I bought over there to transfer backups from his current backup drive \\(he'd learned, I guess?\\), we discovered that, yes, he'd run a backup on an older backup drive he had and that when we experimentally booted up the \"dead\" laptop, and it asked for an image, he plugged in this one drive and it ... restored to win 7.

        "text": "Tales is back, for those that still know me; read on. For those that don’t know me; my 16 part series from 5 years ago can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesfromTales/comments/17vprw/collection_tales_from_tech_support_series/) and provide some background to parts of these stories.\n\nFive years after that series ended I will finally post the 2 chapters I never posted about my job at a callcenter after the incident in the computer store from Ron and Don.\n\nI wrote these stories about 5 years ago, but was unable to publish them as the manager in this story heard about it because I shared it with someone still working there, and it quickly spread on the department. And well; he threatened to sue me. I wasn’t sure he would actually do it \\- or would be able to win \\- but at that point in my live I wasn’t prepared to go to court over a reddit post, mainly due to the costs involved for something like this. So I never posted them.\n\nAbout a year ago though he was sentenced to 8 years in prison for a number of fraud cases as well as multiple assault charges and numerous incidents with the police. Given so much time has passed since this story and about 4\\-6 years will pass before he is eligible for early release; I think I’m safe in posting this. Otherwise I hope GoFundMe is still around by then.\n\n=====\n\nDuring the month the manager was suspended nothing much happened. When he came back everybody expected him to lash out to everyone, particularly lash out to me. But nothin happened. He seemed calm when he came in and was for the days afterwards I was told. When I came in on Friday to start my shift I had expected him to talk to me. But he did not.\n\nAnother few weeks passed by with nothing out of the ordinary happening. We had some new joiners during these weeks. One of them was a woman that did not particular stood out, but the manager seemed to have found love at first sight.\n\nThe woman he liked was a woman that was in here late twenties and came from another helpdesk company. She wasn’t particularly smart, but she did her work well and without issues. You had no reason to dislike her.\n\nBut given the manager had a crush on her he put her on improvement programs in which he was to mentor her, and weekly meetings to discuss her performance. People that had worse ratings than her did not get anything further than a “you have to show better results next month” comment.\n\nI’m not sure if she started dating him because she could benefit from it, or if she was in any way pressured by him to do so. But in the weeks after they had been spotted around town by multiple colleagues already. I had decided to stay out of it, and kept doing my work.\n\nIn between this time I had gotten another customer that had downloaded the software in question from a third party website, which had repackaged the software with some intrusive spy\\- and adware. The customer was calling to question us as to why we had hacked his system. It took me a while to figure out that he had installed the software from a third party, and in the process I advised him to download a free anti\\-malware removal tool, something like Malwarebytes and then redownload the software from the official website.\n\nThe next day I got transferred a call from a colleague, saying the customer wanted to explicitly talk with me and given my name was attached to his support ticket she forwarded it, we did it in some cases. He was angry with me; saying his system got infected even more. After half an hour of troubleshooting I found out that he had not downloaded a free version from the legitimate version, but downloaded a cracked version; because a pro version would probably find more, and he did not feel he should pay for it. In the progress he infected himself even more. And I was to blame.\n\nFuck my life. Seriously. I did not want to deal with this anymore, and cut him off in his story. Telling him we did not support using pirated software, and if I would support him I would be criminally liable and face the internet privacy police. I ended the conversation right there and then. I did not mind getting let go over this. I mean, we can all only accept up to a certain level of stupidity before reaching our breaking points. Apparently Quality Control thought the same, as my case note had only one remark made by them; justified.\n\nDuring the same time we got a frequent caller; his name was Dietrich and he would often call on one of our larger contracts. The product in question was quite complex and had many many features, so at first we did not notice him to much. The knowledge base was quite extensive and this particular contract made it that the client wanted as few calls as possible to second line, so we were allowed to do more than on other contract.\n\nSo Dietrich blended in with the call volume for that product at first. He was noticed by everyone in the team as he would call, and if the voice answering was male he would quickly disconnect and call again. If the voice was female he would stay on the line and ask arbitrary questions about the product.\n\nThis went on for a few weeks, in which many theories about Dietrich were formed in the office. In that sense Dietrich brought the team together more than the mandatory 15 minute morning get togethers we had. Though he did not release our stress like the Animal Shake did.\n\nAt first it was innocent; we thought he was just a user of the software that did not understand it. Maybe he had a learning disorder or other mental problems. He seemed OK further, aside from his weird behaviour and mannerisms in talking. This went on for weeks, and he started to become irritating, but nobody filed an complaints.\n\nAfter these few weeks he become more deranged and one of our female colleagues remarked that she had the feeling he was mastrubating to the conversations. As time went on more female colleagues came to the same conclusion, and when I had him on line I could tell he was indeed doing that. I ended the call right then and there. I was not getting paid enough to be dealing with this.\n\nWe collectively filed a complaint internally and gave the numbers he called from to get blocked on our systems. The complains went through and IT would look at getting the numbers blocked, but as most of it was outsourced it took weeks before they did it. \n\nIn\\-between the hundreds of normal calls we would handle the change of getting him was relatively low, but each time you would pick up the phone it would be like playing Russian roulette. He kept changing numbers calling at different times. His conversations became more agitated and he started to insult male staff when he got them on the phone, and saying sexually explicit sentences out of context for any female staff. We would hang up as soon as we heard him and note down numbers to have those blocked as well.\n\nTogether with HR we filed a police report, hoping they would be able to track this man down. His calls got sparser over time until they stopped. We heard nothing from him in 2 weeks time. We thought it was over. It wasn’t.\n\nWhat was over though was the relation between the manager Danny and the woman from the office that had recently joined. She cheated on him and broke up afterwards and left the company. She also had filed a complaint with HR and a police report for sexual harassment. I don’t know if any of that was true and I frankly just wanted to keep out of it. But it put Danny in a foul foul mood and he was terrible to everyone.\n\nHe jumbled the shifts to annoy people he did not like. He fired a couple of people that seemed to be in happy moods \\(Again, students, the disposable workforce of callcenters\\) and reacted disproportionally hard to mistakes people made or when someones ratings where bad enough to have a drop in department metrics.\n\nIt stopped being fun real quick. I was already at the point where I wanted to leave, but I wanted to ride it out until summer vacation, go back to my family for the summer and find something new when I returned for the new school year. \n\nIt happened on a Friday at about two in the afternoon. You see, Dietrich was still obsessed with the female staff. And during the weeks he did not call he was busy researching where we worked apparently. The building we worked in was shared by multiple companies and security was non\\-existent. So he easily walked in the building and after a while he found out the floor that we were on.\n\nHe went in and found the first female staffer sitting at her desk. He grabbed her chest from behind with both arms around her and pushed his head next to hers. He said “I love you” which was followed by a scream from her and everyone looking at her direction. Two nearby students quickly reacted and pulled him off her with much trouble. Another quickly helped the girl getting away from him.\n\nWhile the students were trying to keep him under control he managed to escape and quickly ran towards another female coworker and grabbed her as well, holding her firmly.\n\nAt this point the manager also came into the picture and tried to assess the situation. The man started shouting that the he was in love with the woman here and wanted to marry them and that they were ignoring him and they needed to be punished and come with him. He was rather deranged at this moment.\n\nBefore all this happened and his calls were still innocuous I had already suspected that this was someone with limited mental abilities so I tried to be as nice and patient as possible. When he started to become more sexually explicit I stopped doing that and hanging up. Same was true for a colleague named Shannnon.\n\nHe started shouting he wanted to meet Tales and Shannon and wanted to marry us and we needed to come with him now. The manager pointed at the both of us and casually said “go with him, you are whores anyway, all woman are”. He looked at the deranged man and said to him “don’t bother with them, they are gonna leave you anyway, the all do“. He then walked out as if nothing was going on.\n\nMe and Shannon were both aghast with what we just heard, but the same students that tackled Dietrich the first time, now used the confusion to tackle him again and keep him pinned until the police came a few minutes later. All in all it lasted 20 minutes. \n\nAfter the police had taken statements from me and my colleagues the manager came in again and demanded everyone to knock off with this nonsense and to get back to work. I mean, nobody got hurt or died, but two woman were put in very uncomfortable positions and two 19 years old had to handle the situation; the manager did nothing, if anything he made it worse.\n\nI decided then and there that I wanted no more part of it, when I walked out to go home the manager threw a fit. I got in an argument with him about what he did and didn’t do just now. But he kept his ground saying he did nothing wrong.\n\nHe would never understand what he did. It was pointless. So I walked out, never coming back. A few weeks later I got a legal letter stating my termination due to non\\-show and inappropriate behaviour on the workflow.\n\nThe manager did again get into trouble, but managed to turn everything around and blame me for a large part of the incident. Over the weeks after a lot of the students quit as well so nobody was left to counter his story.\n\nAs for Dietrich, I later found out that we was a mental patient and he had driven 6 hours to our building on that day. As the police were involved it all eventually went to court and he got mandatory mental treatment  from what I heard. I never heard from my prospective husband again, neither did Shannon.",

        "text": "Tales is back, for those that still know me; read on. For those that don’t know me; my 16 part series from 5 years ago can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesfromTales/comments/17vprw/collection_tales_from_tech_support_series/) and provide some background to parts of these stories.\n\nFive years after that series ended I will finally post the 2 chapters I never posted about my job at a callcenter after the incident in the computer store from Ron and Don.\n\nI wrote these stories about 5 years ago, but was unable to publish them as the manager in this story heard about it because I shared it with someone still working there, and it quickly spread on the department. And well; he threatened to sue me. I wasn’t sure he would actually do it \\- or would be able to win \\- but at that point in my live I wasn’t prepared to go to court over a reddit post, mainly due to the costs involved for something like this. So I never posted them.\n\nAbout a year ago though he was sentenced to 8 years in prison for a number of fraud cases as well as multiple assault charges and numerous incidents with the police. Given so much time has passed since this story and about 4\\-6 years will pass before he is eligible for early release; I think I’m safe in posting this. Otherwise I hope GoFundMe is still around by then.\n\n-----\n\nSo about a year after the rather abrupt end of my employment at Ron and Don’s computer\\-store I entered the workforce again. I had decided against working in retail again, for reasons you are sure to understand by now. So when a technical Helpdesk position came available it seemed to be the best option available for me. It was only for about 16 to 20 hours a week to supplement my student income.\n\nAfter a few days I got a call back on my online application; Someone called Danny, who was the manager of this callcenter was on the other side of the line. During the conversation \\- which had been completely normal up to this point \\- he suddenly put down the horn out of nowhere, allowing me to still listen in to what was happening on the background.\n\nApparently someone had entered the office, and he started screaming obscenities at someone in his office. It ended with a Trump\\-esqe “You are Fired” tirade with a voice that was beyond breaking from the shouting. He then came back on the phone, said sorry which his now hoarse voice and continued on with the conversation as if nothing happened.\n\nI thought I knew better by now; to identify red flags when they present themselves so bluntly. But clearly I still had a lot to learn. I was to come to the office for a 2nd interview\n\nThe second interview was with a woman; a manager from another department in the company who was nice, but preoccupied with other things it seems. Given it was just a job to earn some money to cover student living costs I didn’t think much of it. A couple days later I got a hefty package in the mail with my contract and other documents.\n\nI started on a Friday as my off\\-days as a student were Friday through Sunday for the semester. I would work every week on Friday and Saturday with the option to do Sundays in case it was needed. For example with big software launches some companies would buy extra capacity on Sundays.\n\nThe company itself was quite big and bid on anything that could be done over the phone or otherwise remotely. From software support, to insurance to magazine subscriptions to cold\\-calling.\n\nIt was rumoured that one of the owners also owned a sex phone / texting line.\n\nThe team I joined was about 75 people working for 24 different contracts. Everyone would start with one contract and over time add more contract to our skillset. Training consisted of little more than showing which buttons to press on the call system, knowledge base and call log software for billing. All contracts where first line only so anything more complicated than what was in the knowledge base would have to be pushed to second line support, which was often handled by the client itself.\n\nThe team itself was a mishmash of students, college dropouts, a number of people in workforce re\\-integration programs \\(to go from welfare to a paying job again\\) and about 8 people who had been employed at this company for 10 to 15 years. I can’t help but wonder if that constituted a human rights violation.\n\nMost people kept to themselves; you are mostly dealing with the customers anyway, and helping someone else or just talking idly could hurt your ratings. Ratings directly influenced your pay because the monthly performance bonus was about one third of your salary.\n\nThe call volume was way too high for the amount of people that were in at any given moment. So it was easy for most to reach their targets, but at the expense of a high number of people quitting due to a burn\\-out or finding something better. That was why most of the labor force were expendable students.\n\nAfter a brief introduction by one of the people working there I was on my own; having to take calls. Luckily I was already familiar with the particular software I was assigned too, as it was one of the programs I had to use in school as well. So the first 2 days went by without to much problems. But I did notice I rarely talked with anyone on the team.\n\nThere wasn’t much of a team, rather an assorted amount of people that would show up at a certain time do their work and leave again at another designated time.\n\nThe company had problems with a government agency regarding the high burn\\-out rate and a number of lawsuits that had been filed by ex\\-employee’s over their health issues caused by the high demands of the job. As part of a settlement \\(and cover themselves for future litigation\\) they launched as wellness program that started after my first week at the company.\n\nIt was trying to foster a team\\-spirit, and even worse, a company spirit. A lot of cheesy posters about good working habits and a mandatory show up 15 minutes early every morning to do a quick team power session.\n\nSo during the first session we had something called the Animal Shake. The idea was that wild animals, like zebras, gazelles and giraffes would have a huge adrenaline boost when they need to flee a predator. After they have escaped they shake their body and limbs to release that energy and go on with their day. So we were to jump around and shake our legs and feet to reinvigorate ourselves. The instructors said that they know some people may not want to do it at the office in front of everyone, so they could do it on the toilet instead.\n\nOne of the guy students loudly made the remark that it would explain why the male toilets are always so disgusting, if everyone is doing the Animal shake while doing number one and two. It was a witty remark, it did not mean anything, it made people laugh, and lightened the mood.\n\nBut the manager \\- Danny, the one who I had the first call with \\- was also present and he apparently was under a lot of pressure to make this work for compliance with the government agencies and lawsuit agreements and he went ballistic at the guy.\n\nThe student made a remark that he should maybe try the animal shake to release his stress. Some people \\- including me \\- laughed, some knew better and braced for impact.\n\nThe manager became visibly red and started shouting “You are the reason this team does not work”, “People like you ruin it for everyone!” and finally when he calmed down a bit \\(without doing the Animal shake\\) he said \\- in front of the whole group \\- “you are fired, get your stuff and don’t come back”. He then walked out, leaving everyone unsure what to do next.\n\nI did not know what to do a week later when that same manager stood next to my desk and said we needed to talk. We walked to his office and had me sit down before he started talking; “we need to talk about your resolution times; they are way too high and you are not putting enough calls through to second line”.\n\nI retorted; “but isn’t it my job to resolve the issues of the caller without escalating to second line?”. He looked at me as if I was the dumbest person he ever met. ”It doesn’t work like that you know, you are a pretty girl, so I don’t expect you to understand. But I need you to understand, so please listen carefully”.\n\nLet me tell you that sexist comments are never fun to hear; but personally I find them even worse in German. Though I am German, I never liked the German language. It’s coarse and barbaric and lacks the subtleness of many other languages. Sexist comments In German sound even more uncivilised.\n\nApparently billing was based on a monthly fee which had a total number of calls in it. The contract was purely based on taking a call, not the duration or providing a solution. Just taking the call. So having customers call back often and pushing any questions we can’t answer in under a minute to the client second line support was very profitable for the company; so they heavily pushed us to escalate. It’s just that nobody had told me that in the first week.\n\nOne of my calls I got was from someone who had pirated the software. The developers put in some countermeasures to limit functionality during use when it was detected the software was pirated. Basically reverting it to only being able to view the files, but not editing or saving anything.\n\nThis was known functionality to us, and we were to inform the “customer” that he needs to buy a valid licence in order to use the software fully. He insisted he bought it, but could not provide any proof that he did. He started to become abusive, and as usual started bitching about seeing the manager, and how as a woman I’m incompetent and am unable to comprehend how important it is that this software works.\n\nWe are not allowed to hang up on customers, and every time we do hang up before the customer does the call is recorded and flagged for review by a separate quality assurance team. The manager took out any reprimand he got for problematic calls out on the team and the person with the most calls reviewed in particular. So everyone tried to limit the amount of quality reviews they got as much as possible.\n\nSo I decided to escalate to the manager as per request; I mean; the customer is king right? Well the manager was already pissed that day, and after getting this particular client and listening to his problems, I saw him starting to boil. It did not take long for him to get into heated argument with the person on the line and Finally blast into a rage overwhelming everyone in the office with his vocabulary of swearwords, before hanging up the call and walking away from my desk.\n\nIt did not take long for this outburst to make it’s way through the company and his manager showing up on the department floor. Despite his terrible personality and anger problems he did manage to turn the department around from a loss department to one of the most profitable ones of the company. So they were unlikely to let him go.\n\nThe internal quality team found that I had done nothing wrong, so I received no reprimands. The manager was suspended for 1 month, but from the rumours it was only for show and he still got paid during this time. The only good thing that had come out of it was that he had to follow anger management classes. Though this was on the cards for a long time already as this wasn’t his first outburst they had to deal with.\n\nI wanted to leave, but I was low on cash and wanted to stay on at least 6 more months until I finished my first year, got the yearly bonus \\(however little it was\\) and could get back to my family for the summer. I would have finished up those 6 months; but then Dietrich happened.\n\n[Chapter 18 \\- Inappropriate Behaviour ](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/8hfvd3/chapter_18_inappropriate_behaviour/)",

Since $FinalPassword Enterprise has a lot of shiny features, I've never poked around in it much beyond the account screens. After the presenter points out policies and how to view the history in it, I open up the log viewer to check it's been applied.\n\nImagine my surprise when I see this:\n\n**$Colleague:** (7 hours ago) warning: master password is re-used for abc.com  \n**$Colleague:** (7 hours ago) warning: master password is re-used for def.com  \n**$Colleague:** (7 hours ago) warning: master password is re-used for ghi.com  \n**$Colleague:** (7 hours ago) warning: master password is re-used for jkl.com  \n\nFor the uninitiated, the warning means that the 'master password' for $FinalPassword itself is being re-used on a myriad of other sites. The whole *point* of a password manager is that you can use multiple passwords (ideally randomly generated) for different sites and only need to remember the master. However, $Colleague has basically got the password manager remembering a single password (its own) for each and every site.\n\nI pulled $Colleague aside and gave them a short lecture on why this is a phenomenally bad idea with the number of leaks, meaning just one of these sites could end up compromising the whole company (including anything that gets shared with them via $FinalPassword), and how he really, really needs to use the random-password feature for each one. Turns out $Colleague had changed his master password that day by coincidence, hence the warnings in the logs I saw.\n\nI have now switched on a policy that prevents the master password being used elsewhere.\n\nEdit: formatting",

I checked eBay for previous prices\n\nThey them decided that they want to sell it, and asked me how much it'd go for. They also asked me to put it on eBay. These days I don't bother with buying any thing for them, as well it's so much hassle when they buy something they chose, and then decide they don't want it, and you have to pay to send it back..\n\nAny way, I sold the monitor first. It went for about £35. It was reasonable. That's how much others sold for. For reference, I sold a similar monitor of mine two years prior to that, for about £50, so it's reasonable for the monitor to depreciate that amount\n\nThey then started to shout at me, and telling me why I sold it for that much, when they asked me to put it on eBay, and well the risk for them is that the market may pay less than they want, which was a reasonable price any way.\n\nI then tell them but the desktop PC will sell for £180 easily. Cue an uncle who's never worked in IT shouting, saying\" I think that the monitor is the most important part. It's like the engine in a car. Come on u/b1tchlasagna, have some common sense. You should know this \"\n\nI then try to tell them about how I log on to computers (I log on to networking devices primarily but they are fundamentally computers)  and I don't need a monitor, and that we have hundreds of servers in the data centre, not one which has it's own dedicated monitor.\n\nCue   You don't know any thing\" and me then refusing to sell any other part of it. I wasn't going to break it down in terms of parts, but in terms of selling the desktop, monitor, keyboard and mouse\n\nOn a side note, I hate the words \"common sense\" as in my experience, people who use that term typically think they know more than they actually do. Everyone has blind spots in their knowledge. Accept it... I obviously know nothing about medicine, and I wouldn't go to a plumber to ask about some \" common sense\" way to fix it",

        "text": "So, I’m on mobile, and even off mobile, I’ve got issues with paragraph breaks and all. Immediate apology for bad formatting. Additional apologies for odd phrasing, it’s 5:30 AM here, and my brain’s basically turned off. I’m also not what you’d call a “professional” who “gets paid,” I’m just the most accessible nerd in a small, somewhat isolated, town, and I’m available Sunday mornings. As a result, I’ve become an informal tech support service for the nearby over 60 crowd. I also don’t fix big problems. I clean desktops, I set up digital cameras, I work out compatibility issues for crochet pattern programs, and fairly commonly, I deal with those intimidating IE popups that yell at you to call a number, because compooter got veerus.\n\nBut I quickly came to realize that one of these retirees was not like the others. Let’s call her Miss C. Miss C’s been around as long as any of her neighbors can remember. She’s a delight to be around, and she pays in muffins. An excellent deal. One day, she wakes me up at 6ish with a call.\n\nMiss C: (Cap), it says the FBI thinks I’m in trouble, but I know it’s not the FBI. Can you come and fix it?\nMe: Sure! Give me a minute.\n\nShe doesn’t do well on the phone, so I bike to her place, clear the popup (you could hear the synthesized voice whining about “HARD DRIVE OF PRZERONOGRAPHY” from the front door), and update a few things. This gradually turns into a three and a half hour problem solving spree: Driver updating, printer fixing, password updating, etc. During this, I realize that there are a few things about Miss C that just don’t quite add up. She’s remarkably tech literate, and only really has issues with more obscure things that you’d run into from messing with more advanced settings, as well as fairly new things, and things she forgets how to do. So, eventually it gets to a point where I’m reminding her about Ctrl-Alt-Del to bring up the task manager, and she strikes up a conversation that makes everything fall into place.\n\nMiss C: Oh! That still works?\nMe: Yep. Your last computer did it, too.\nMiss C: No, not that, back when I was a programmer...\n\nCue a thirty minute conversation, during which she reveals that she wrote custom programs for financial something or others in QBASIC and a number of other languages I can’t remember around 25 years ago, and wrote programs for her company’s UNIVAC mainframe for another 10 before that. Those dates might be wrong, my memory’s pretty trash for a few things.\n\nThe basic gist was that she started programming when it was seen strictly as a job for women, and hung on when the field began to make a drastic male dominated shift, simply because she was good, and she’d been around for a while. She was using more advanced settings the way she’d been using them for 15 years, and wasn’t quite sure how they’d changed, so she guessed a bit, and later forgot she altered the settings at all. After much googling, digging around, and eventually digging up of a bunch of photos she thought were lost, I left, rewarded with some stories of her own tech support headaches, and six fresh muffins.\n\nMore of a people heavy story than a tech heavy story, but I feel I should share it somewhere, and this is certainly a tale from tech support. When I’m dealing with someone who refuses to let me help them, or insists something’s “the computer’s fault” when I’m trying to fix a problem, or generally stalls or pushes me around, I like to think that there are more people like Miss C out there. It’s the ones like her that make the headaches worth it. Now, she likes to tell me about her old job while I help her out. She even dug up a couple old punch tapes she’d worked on, once.\n\nAgain, my apologies for any sketchy details or incorrect dates. I really struggle to remember details from conversations I have when I’m working on something. I took her age, and some general timeframes, and guesstimated the dates, but they seem about right.\n\nHonestly? I really hope I meet more people like Miss C doing this. She’s the reason I get excited when my phone wakes me up.",

The account is then set to require the password be changed on the next login. It's also important to mention that $GovOrg has an SLA agreement with the company I actually work for that the average handle time be no more than 6 minutes for simple things like password resets. Anything  more complicated should be routed to an $OnSiteTech. As you can imagine, some certain end-users have difficulty entering simple passwords, so this has been a great point of consternation for many of us. As such, we used to give simple passwords like \"password123\" for the temporary ones.... Here is an average exchange.     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt; &gt; **$Me** Thank you for calling the $GovOrg Service Desk, My name is **$Me**, (rest of call opening)\n\n&gt; &gt; **$User** &lt;Yeah, I can't log in to $SystemThatRequiresADCredentials.\n\n\n*I do my usual thing of verifying their information and being sure they are who they say they are*\n\n&gt; &gt; **$Me**: Okay, your password is %, A like alpha... No A like alpha. Yes \"A\" like Andrew.... *and so on*\n\n\nAfter about 15 minutes the average user finally gets the old password entered and the new password set.... That's assuming they are savvy. If they aren't it might take longer....\n\nEDIT: Grammar",

        "text": "So, Family Member (FM) got a new Mac a few months back. His old one had taken one too many spills, and was going to cost more to fix than a new one would cost, so there you go. The old one still booted in Target Mode, so it was easy to get his data back.\n\nThe old Mac was terribly disorganized. A gazillion files on the desktop, 10 copies of the same file downloaded in his Downloads, etc.\n\nI created a folder on his desktop called \"Files from Old Mac\", inside which there were new folders like \"Old Mac Desktop\", \"Old Mac Documents\", \"Old Mac Downloads\", etc. Our very first conversation before I handed over the new Mac?\n\n&gt; Me: Hey FM, there's a folder on your desktop that's called \"Files from Old Mac\". All of your stuff from the old computer is in there. You should go through those folders, 1 at a time, and copy over the stuff you want to keep from the old Mac. Copy from \"Old Mac Documents\" to the \"Documents\" folder, and so on, ok?   \n\n&gt; FM: Ok, that's a great idea. I really need to clean stuff up. This will make me do it.\n\n&gt; Me: Good deal. Your bookmarks and keychain were sync'd to iCloud, so those came right back.\n\n&gt; FM: That's great! Thanks a million! (he gave me a $10 gift card to Target. just shy of a million...)\n\nFast forward a few months, and we're at a family thing at FM's place. That conversation?\n\n&gt; FM: I can't find any of my old documents. I really need to find them. Like yesterday.\n\n&gt; Me: Ok, remember, I made the folder on your desktop called \"Files from Old Mac\"? You were going to go through the files and copy the ones you really wanted over to the regular directories.\n\n&gt; FM: I don't remember anything like that at all.\n\n&gt; Me: You were all pumped about how you were going to take the opportunity to straighten things up, like it's Spring cleaning or something like that.\n\n&gt; FM: Well, here, show me where the files are (whips out computer).\n\n&gt; Me: Well, they *were* right here on the desktop. Did you delete them?\n\n&gt; FM: Well, I deleted the folder with the old stuff, since I figured that was out of date and all.  \n  \n&gt; Me: You deleted all your old Mac's files then.\n  \n&gt; FM: You can get those back, right?\n\n&gt; Me: No, the machine's been formatted and recycled for parts. If you deleted the files, they're gone. Can you restore from backup? (I handed him an external hard drive when he got the machine and showed him how Time Machine works). \n\n&gt; FM: I've never used that backup thing. I couldn't remember what to do. I can't believe you'd let me delete everything.\n\nYeah, so I'm the guy who rescued your data, told you to do backups, etc. I'm *not* the guy who deleted the data, and I'm also not the guy who ignored the advice to do the backups. But I'm the bad guy somehow, because \"computer magic\".",

        "text": "LTL, FTP.  This happened the other day and gave me a bit of a chuckle.  I was hoping it might give a few of you a smile too.\n\nCharacters:\nMe : yours truly.\nMom: the better half of yours truly\nK: our 8 year old daughter\n\nFor this to make sense, a little background on me is necessary.  I spent a decade or so doing tech support to pay my way through college.  I started as your bright eyed T1 script monkey.  With a bit of hard work and some luck I slowly progressed my way up to the grumpy guy in the corner that the T3 techs would cautiously approach and go “Hey, I know we’re not supposed to bother you unless it is an emergency, but something really weird is happening…”.  I call this time the dark ages - not because I hated tech support - I enjoyed it a lot.  But the stress of working and going to school full time while slowly having my faith in humanity sucked from me one phone call at a time left a pretty lasting impression on me.\n\nAs such, my family knows two basic facts when it comes to me and computers.  First, I can fix just about any problem they might encounter in day to day life.  Second, I’m not tech support.  I’ll fix it - but I want them to at least have tried themselves first.\n\nSo when my daughter walked up to me and said “Dad, your computer is broken”, she probably wasn’t that surprised when she was met with nothing but a blank stare.\n\n&gt; [K] (channeling her inner teenager and rolling her eyes): ugh - fine.  The screen is flashing off and on.  I’ve tried restarting it.  There is no error message because it just goes off and on.  And mom said this was a Dad problem already so I can’t ask her.\n\nI was actually intrigued at this point.\n\n&gt; [Me] Ok, come show me what is going on.\n\nAt this point, we went up to my office and I grabbed my chain and watched for about 10 minutes while my daughter tried to replicate the problem.  My wife was there working along on her computer as well so we chatted a bit.  Of course nothing happened.  I finally got a bit bored and stood to leave.\n\n&gt; [K] It was broken!  I swear it was.   The screen would go off and back on.  I don’t know why it isn’t doing it now.\n\n&gt; [Mom] It is your Dad.  Computers are afraid of him.  They don’t dare misbehave while he is in the room.\n\nAt this point my daughter grabbed my chair and moved it back in front of the computer and sat down.  She likes to use my chair, but her feet down quite hit the floor so she was swinging them back and forth.  I remembered that I had been messing with the DVI cables that run from my KVM earlier and hadn’t tightened them down.  I theorized she might be kicking the cable - not enough to push it out, but just enough to cause a loose connection to make it flicker.  My daughter sat down and looked at my wife skeptically and said:\n\n&gt; [K] That isn’t true is it Dad?\n\n I figured I could play along, so I walked to the tower and pointed my finger at the case and said:\n\n&gt; [Me] You’d better behave.  You don’t want me coming back in here.  Understand?\n\nI then nudged it closer to the wall with my foot so the cable couldn’t wiggle free.  I figured I’d get a screwdriver and properly tighten things up in a bit (my fingers don’t really fit those screws well any more). \n\nWith that, I left and went to grab a screwdriver.  Along the way I was distracted by something else and forgot all about the loose screws.  However she didn’t come back complaining about the problem so I assumed everything was working.\n\nThe next day after I picked my daughter up from school I asked if her report was done.  She said it was almost done but had just a little bit left.  We started to head upstairs so I could log her onto my computer.  At that point I saw the screwdriver I’d set on the counter the night before and remembered the loose cable.  I walked over to grab it while she continued upstairs to the office.\n\nI was just walking around the corner to the office when I saw her standing there staring at the machine with her hands on her hips.  In the most serious voice I’ve ever heard her use she then pointed her finger at the computer and proceeded to say:\n\n&gt; [K] You’d better behave or I’ll go get Dad!\n\nFor the record when I stopped laughing I did explain what I thought the actual problem was and taught her how to tighten the screws on the DVI cables.  But it gave me a good laugh.\n",

There are 9 keyholders, and the regulations require at least 1 of us to be available at all times.\n\nIt's a saturday night (or early sunday morning, whatever) and i'm just about to head to bed when my phone lights up.  The office alarm system has sent me an SMS telling me that there's an intruder in the support office.\n\nSupport is on the top floor, so they've got in through the window (in-tru-da window... sorry, dad joke).  I jump in my car and head to site, to find that all the windows are closed and there are no ladders / platforms / cherry-pickers anywhere around.  The alarm is blaring but the building looks secure.  I still have to reset the alarm and see what happens.  I'm actually getting paid for this too.  As I'm heading to the staff entrance, the alarm company vehicle arrives and I show the security guard inside the vehicle my work ID.  We go in together.\n\nAlarm disabled... Good.\n\nWe make our way up to the top floor and head to support to find...\n\nSomeone had sent something to the support printer, which is directly underneath the alarm sensor.  The heat from the laser printer was sufficient to trigger the alarm sensor.  I power off the printer and sent everyone an email stating that from now on, turning printers off overnight needs to be part of the end of day routine to save expensive call-outs.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "#long\nHello TFTS. I work tech support at an electronics store, so we see a lot of people with pretty conventional problems - viruses, OS reinstalls, parts just dying out of spite, etc.\n\nSo I'm behind the desk, moving some updating laptops into the overnight cage in preparation to go home when an old woman walks up and asks for help pairing her new headset with her phone. Takes about fifteen seconds to do so, and I walk her through the buttons. This takes a while, but I'm happy to do it, do unto others and all that. She seems to get it, so I check up on something for a minute to wait out the last bit of my shift. And that's when things get difficult.\n\n$customer: Excuse me, can you help? It stopped working. I cannot hear him [the guy in the YouTube video she was watching].\n\n$me: Alright, let's take a look. \n\nBluetooth is on, headset switch is in the on position, volume isn't zero... Wait. No LED blink on the headset. Turn it off, wait a moment, no confirmation vibration. Turn it on again, wait, yes. Alrighty, it's working again. Check the BT connection, it's good, play the video and it's all working nicely. She says I must be very intelligent, thanks me, and I take my leave and check on some paperwork. A little bit longer...\n\n$customer waves me over again.\n\n$customer: I cannot hear him. It is not working.\n\nSo I go through the process again, but stay and watch for a moment after to see what the issue is. It turns out that she turns the headset off and on with one quick motion, which keeps the headset from booting properly. So I respectfully explain that she needs to be patient and wait for the vibration.\n\n$customer: Oh, okay. So I turn it off and on? [Proceeds to do it too fast again]\n\n$me: No, it needs a moment to start up and it'll tell you. [Demonstrates]\n\n$customer: Oh, okay, I have to wait.\n\nShe starts listening to her video again (why she did this at the desk I'll never know). I glance at my watch, and it's time to flee the building! Yaaaay! I gather my things, start making my way to the exit-\n\n$customer waves me over\n\nDespair grips my soul. \n\n$customer: I cannot hear him. Can you hear him? [Shoves headset at my face]\n\n$me: Uhh-\n\n$customer: Wait, he is speaking French. I'll find an English video for you.\n\nShe then pulls up a video (in English) about one of the aspects of the Buddha in Chinese culture... Which isn't one of my typical troubleshooting steps, to say the least. \n\n$customer: Can you hear him?\n\nSo I listen, and no, I can't. I skip the troubleshooting and restart the headset properly. Surprise surprise, it's fixed.\n\n$me, frustrated and anxious to leave but still respectful: When you turn it off, you need to wait ten seconds or it won't work.\n\n$customer: Oh, okay. I need to count ten seconds.\n\nSo she waits ten seconds, and **then** flicks the switch in the exact way I've been trying to stop. \n\n$me, rictus grin on my face: You have to wait for the buzz after you turn it off before turning it on. [Demonstrates]\n\n$customer: Oh, okay. [Does it properly] it works! Thank you so much! You must be very intelligent.\n\n$me: no problem, have a nice day! [Gets the hell out of Dodge]\n\nSo I left, confident that she would ignore my advice and be trapped in her Sisyphean struggle vs. the evil headset. I do very much try to help and make sure people understand what they're doing. But really $customer, if you're going to ignore me, don't ask for my help. I glanced back after clocking out, and she was still at the desk, so I hope that my coworkers weren't sucked in like I was.\n\nTL;DR: old lady asks for help with headset, then ignores everything I say.",

        "text": "So it's been a long time since I've posted from this account, but since I've told this story to a few people who are trying to find my main account on this subreddit for a prize I need to ditch my main. \n\nThis is the story about a possessed computer that had me taken for a ride for most of the week. \n\nI got a ticket and an email late Tuesday afternoon about a computer in one of our manufacturing rooms that experienced ODBC errors in the program, and on reboot the \"mouse went berserk\" \n\nNow with our application, an ODBC error occurs when the application loses connection to the server most often than not caused by a network error in which a reboot of the PC and check or wipe down of the ethernet cable (alcohol rag on the termination end) will fix. The technician and tech lead for the area did just this (I have trained them well) and the computer came back up online. With one major issue. \n\nThey submitted a ticket including the ODBC error as well as \"on reboot the mouse went berserk, and we could not control it to reboot the PC again\" I called the tech up in the morning to ask what went wrong. She explained it was as if the mouse was being controlled remotely. It was right clicking on its own, moving around the screen sporadically, \"drawing boxes\" aka click and drag on the desktop, and all around could not be controlled. \n\nThey unplugged the USB mouse, even tried the touch screen and nothing would stop this mouse pointer from its possessed rage. They eventually unplugged the computer and on power restore it was working perfectly. \n\nWe agreed if this happened again, take a video on your phone and let me know as soon as possible, even let it go and let me VNC in and watch or drive in to see in person. \n\nNow being the Sherlock Holmes that I am could not let this go. I grabbed every log I could think of off the machine, application log and all 5 event viewer hives for investigation. \n\nOver the course of the week I made it a point to dedicate an hour or so every day to read these logs and figure out what happened. \n\nNothing. No VNC connections (we were all off shift), no remote connections/assistance, no other users logging in, nothing as much as a driver failure on the USB driver or touch screen malfunction. \n\nI all but gave up until today. Watching the clock on a Friday ready to bail as soon as the second hand hit the 12 on 5, I finally discovered what I could only describe as a \"Lightbulb!\" moment.\n\nSerMouse. \n\nOn the production PCs we have a series of COM ports opened on a serial adapter box for the scales, as that's the only way we can get them to talk to our application. On reboot after the ODBC error, Windows decided \"Hey, we see a serial port, that must be a mouse!\" and loaded the SerMouse driver to connect to the first available scale. At this point, Windows had no idea what to do with the serial output of an analytical manufacturing scale (measures fractions of a gram and prone to ambient air movement if the case isn't closed) and the mouse pointer went absolutely insane. \n\nI still don't know why this happened on the reboot, as I haven't seen this issue since the 2000/NT age, even a few times on XP but never on a 7 box. \n\nI immediately emailed the tech lead back explaining this long history of mice, microsoft, and serial connections and how they thwarted the IT guy for days until it finally clicked. I got an email and call back thanking me for the explanation (Weird right?) and how interesting it was. \n\nI guess Monday is an update to the installation of the application for production machines and the regedit fix of stopping SerMouse \n\nFor anyone interested: \n\n    HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\sermouse &gt; Start &gt; set value to '4'\n\n**TL;DR: Windows thought a serial connected scale was a mouse, mouse pointer had a demonic episode, IT guy couldn't catch it for days**\n\n",

        "text": "So this literally just happened now and I'm still steaming after getting back from a meeting with the boss.\n\nSome guy from ISP A came over selling their internet \\+ phone package to our company. Definitely way better than what ISP B currently gives us. 10x the speed, cheaper phone lines, retain the same numbers, and and direct rather than VoIP, and we save 30$ or something per month, which is pretty big for a small business.\n\nBoss asks me about the VoIP to direct, asking how the current system is. See, a few months back, the Modem/Router combo that ISP B gave us died on us and the internet and phone lines were out of commission. Internet was easily fixed by using the company cellphone as a hotspot, but the phones were really dead, and customer support was being a bitch.  \n\nSo ISP A is offering direct, meaning that if the modem/router dies, it doesn't necessarily mean that the phones will be dead too.  I explain it to my boss how it works and the conversation went something like this:\n\nBoss: So what makes ISP B's phone line different?\n\nMe: If the modem/router dies, the phone won't. \n\nBoss: Wasn't it always like that?\n\nMe: No, cuz it was connected to the same box. So if your modem/router goes down, your phones are down too. \n\n*\\-and here comes the clincher\\-*\n\nBoss: **I don't think so.** \n\n...\n\nSo boss asks the other employees who are non\\-IT and they agree with me saying that that's how the system works, AND BOSS BELIEVES THEM!\n\nIt's ALWAYS been like this too. Even when the modem/router was down before. I told her the modem/router box is dead cuz no wifi signal, etc etc. Boss just says \"No you just misplugged something or maybe didn't set an option right\" and in my mind I'm just like \"BITCH I TOOK A PHOTO BEFORE I UNPLUGGED ANYTHING. IT'S ALL THE SAME.\"\n\nugh....why did she even hire an IT only to second\\-guess the IT. ",

        "text": "Hey everyone, LTL/FTP, all that good stuff, please be gentle. Strap in, because this is a long one.\n\nI do Linux sysadmin-y and support stuff as my main job (with a dash of networking thrown in). Vagueness for job security. I also do one-on-one tech support with personal clients as a side gig I started while still in college. Most of these clients are older and pretty well off. This invariably means iDevices. They aren’t my favourite, but I can fix anything and I’ve learned to work with them. (I do own an iPhone… They got me with the iPod back in the day, what can I say? This is relevant later.)\n\nI hadn’t heard from one of my clients in a few years. Not a big deal, it happens. I also know what it means when that kind of client gives me a call out of the blue. They’ve broken everything they own, and they’re in a panic. Last week was no exception.\n\nFor this scene, we have yours truly, **CC**, and **Sweet Older Lady (SOL)**.\n\n*phone rings, client name pops up*\n\n&gt;**CC**: “Hello, this is CC. How can I help you?”  \n&gt;**SOL**: “Hi, this is SOL. I don’t know if you remember me… *some generalities about our last appointment three years ago*”  \n&gt;**CC**: “Yes, of course. It’s nice to hear from you again.”  \n&gt;**SOL**: “So, I’ve got this problem… My laptop keeps asking me for my password, and it’s getting in the way of my work. It’s really annoying. Can you fix it?”\n\nI ponder for a second. Her phrasing is interesting. If it’s in the way of her work, but not stopping her…\n\n&gt;**CC**: “So, you can use your computer, but there’s a ‘box’ asking you for a password while you’re working?”  \n&gt;**SOL**: “Yes, that’s right.”  \n&gt;**CC**: “Is this for your iCloud password?”  \n&gt;**SOL**: “I think so, though I’m not sure. I’ve tried putting that one in, but it says it’s wrong. But the box keeps popping up and if I click Later, it just comes back!”\n\nYup, definitely the macOS iCloud dialog box. She’s forgotten her password.\n\n&gt;**CC**: “Okay, that’s fine. We can just reset it.”  \n&gt;**SOL**: “I’ve tried. But it never works.”\n\nI figured.\n\n&gt;**CC**: “You have an iPhone as well, correct?”  \n&gt;**SOL**: “Yes, I do.”  \n&gt;**CC**: “Great. We can use that to recover your password.”\n\nI knew this, as I’d been the one to set this all up three years ago. We agree on an appointment time two days later.\n\n~ Two Days Later ~\n\nI arrive at her house. I’d tried to call ahead to confirm earlier in the day, but hadn’t heard back. (This is also relevant later). A little strange, but she was just getting off work so I didn’t think too much of it. I knock on the door. Thankfully she’s there and lets me in. I get set up on her kitchen table with her laptop. It loads up, asks for her password to login.\n\n&gt;**CC**: “Can you enter your password, please?”  \n&gt;**SOL**: “Oh, sure. One second.”\n\nShe gets out the Small Pad of Passwords, which is a universal smart-but-not-great-with-tech thing. I find it adorable. I get logged in, and the first thing I see is the system asking for the Keychain password, which she enters. Then the iCloud password dialog comes up.\n\n&gt;**SOL**: “See?”\n\nShe hits ‘Later’ before I can say anything. It comes back in two seconds. And I know exactly what’s happened.\n\nFor the uninitiated/sane, the macOS Keychain is the program that stores saved passwords (among other things). For ease of use, it’s locked using the same password as the user’s login password. When that user logs in, the system uses that to ‘unlock the keychain’, granting access to those stored passwords. The only times the system should ask the user to unlock this keychain itself are if a user has gone in and changed the keychain password manually (far beyond the technical level of typical users), or they’ve been locked out of their computer and changed their password to get back in using unusual means.\n\nShorter explanation: General password f***ery.\n\n&gt;**CC**: “Okay, I see what you mean. Let’s reset your password and get you going.”\n\nI go through a few screens, and asked to verify my identity using one of a few options. I choose the “send a text to verified number on account” option, as I can guess that she’s not logged into iCloud on any of her other devices and we can’t use that.\n\n&gt;**CC**: “Great. You should receive a text on your iPhone in a few seconds with a code. May I see it?”\n\nShe looks startled.\n\nUh oh.\n\n&gt;**SOL**: “I’m afraid my cell phone stopped working yesterday afternoon. It’s why I didn’t call you to confirm our appointment. I only had your number saved there.”\n\n**Uh oh.**\n\n&gt;**CC**: “That’s alright. Let me take a look at it and see if we can get you up and running again.”\n\nShe hands me her phone. It’s off. I turn it on. The “connect to iTunes (I’m in Recovery mode, shhh)” graphic pops up.\n\n***Uh oh***.\n\n&gt;**CC**: “Um. Tell me what exactly happened when this started.”  \n&gt;**SOL**: “I kept getting this popup asking if I wanted to update. I hit no like I always do, but I guess I hit the wrong button this time? It started downloading and it was taking *forever*, so my friend suggested I turn the phone off. I did, and then that happened. It won’t turn on again.”\n\nಠ_ಠ\n\nMy internal sigh is heard around the world, and every tech support worker unconsciously shivers.\n\nI don my extremely patient, professional voice.\n\n&gt;**CC**: “Okay, I think I know what happened. iPhones are pretty tough (lies) and about the only thing you can do to break them is if you turn if off during an update (bigger lies). Please don’t do that.”  \n&gt;**SOL**: “I guess that was pretty silly of me. I won’t do that again.”  \n&gt;**CC**: “That’s alright. We can use your laptop to download the phone update and install in on your phone.”\n\nI plug her phone in. iTunes pops up asking if I’d like to update or recover the phone to factory. Update. Would I like to download the software? Yes.\n\nError. This version of iTunes is too friggin' old.\n\nOkay. Let’s go update iTunes.\n\nOpen up the App Store, go to Updates, hit Update on the iTunes listing.\n\n**Enter iCloud password.**\n\n**ಠ_ಠ**\n\n&gt;**CC**: “Looks like your computer hasn’t been updated in a while *(see definition: THREE YEARS)*, and I can’t download the phone software without updating it… And I can’t update it until we fix your password. But that’s alright, I can use my own laptop. Can I get your WiFi password?”\n\nI get logged in, plug her phone into my computer, and start the download.\n\n**Estimated Download Time: 2.5 hours**\n\n***ಠ_ಠ***\n\nCheck WiFi signal strength. It’s high. Run a speedtest. It’s very, VERY slow, but matches what I recognize as the lowest speed tier of *MajorCanadianISP*.\n\n&gt;**CC**: “Unfortunately, it looks like you have a very slow internet connection, and the phone software is quite large. It’ll take over two hours to download. I’ll have to set it to download and come back at a later date.”  \n&gt;**SOL**: “Oh, I see. Alright. Well, what about the password thing?”  \n&gt;**CC**: “Let me see if we can go about that another way.”  \n\nI run through the dialog again, and choose the e-mail option. I ask her to check. She doesn’t receive it. Ten minutes pass. I double-check the e-mail address listed (again) with her.\n\n&gt;**SOL**: “Oh! Sorry, that’s my old e-mail address. I don’t use it anymore. My new one is *oldemailaddress* with a 2 at the end.”  \n&gt;**CC**: “I see. Why did you change it?”  \n&gt;**SOL**: “I couldn’t remember the password.”\n\nJust... ***ಠ_ಠ!***\n\n&gt;**CC**: “Well, I can’t use your e-mail, then.”  \n&gt;**SOL**: “Can’t you just change the e-mail address?”  \n&gt;**CC**: “I’d need your correct password for that.”  \n&gt;**SOL**: “Oh.”\n\nAt this point, she’s feeling very bad, as she can see how badly she’s messed up. I’m feeling bad for her and get determined, so I put my Creative Hat (tm) on.\n\n&gt;**CC**: “Well, let me try one more thing. Do you have a paperclip?”\n\nI remove her SIM card and put it into my own iPhone. I receive a few texts meant for her that were still in queue, but none of them are from Apple. I go through the password recovery screens once again, choose SMS once again, and wait. Nothing.\n\n&gt;**CC**: “I’m sorry, this isn’t working. *MajorCanadianCarrier* isn’t exactly known for the best service. I’ll need to come back once the software has downloaded.”  \n&gt;**SOL**: *crestfallen* Okay.\n\nAnd that’s how SOL earned her name. There wasn’t a single thing I could do at that point, couldn't even call Apple Support as they were closed. I charge by the hour, and it didn’t make sense for me to sit around waiting for the download when I literally couldn’t do anything else until it was done. So, we set up another appointment. We leave her laptop on to download the software. She pays me for my time.\n\nTotal time spent: 2 hours.\n\nI go home and download the same software in less than a minute, as I don’t trust her connection. I come back a few days later, flash her phone, use it to recover her password, log her in to all her devices, update them and get her running again in under an hour. And she writes down her shiny new password in her Small Pad of Passwords.\n\nAnd that’s the tale of how I got paid three hours for a (less than) one hour job. SOL apologized profusely for waiting so long to contact me, and has already set up her next appointment with a long list of things she’d like to do.\n\n**Moral of the story**: Don’t wait until everything breaks. AND DON’T TURN IT OFF DURING AN UPDATE.",

What am I being volunteered for?  \n&gt;$SalesDrone: Go talk to $customer, he needs $software updated.\n  \n(NOTE: $customer is a huge company, mumble-hundred-million annual revenue. Huge. Also, I've never heard of $software before.)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt;$customer: So yeah, we need $software updated in our production environment, it's currently at version D and the latest version is J, and we need it to be at the latest version...  \n&gt;Me: *(having frantically inhaled an un-digestable chunk of $software documentation in the past hour)* Okay, so tell me a little bit about your environment.  \n&gt;$customer: Well, as you know, the software is in a client-server configuration. The server runs on $SquinkyUX version A.3...  \n&gt;ME: ....  \n*($SquinkyUX is a well-known Unixoid OS, but version A.3 has gone EOS -- not End of Life, End of Support -- 7 years ago.)*  \n&gt;$customer: ... and the clients are a mixture of SquinkyUX and $Portholes version Bk.   \n&gt;Me: *briefly speechless* I'm sorry, did you say version Bk? The one that came out 15 years ago? THAT version Bk?  \n&gt;$customer: Yup.  \n&gt;Me: Okay. This is going to be a bigger job than I thought. The problem is that there is no direct upgrade path from D to J, we're going to need to go D -&gt; E -&gt;F, etcetera. And the very first upgrade to E will necessitate a migration for the clients, since they can't handle those OS levels -- *because you are running mission-critical applications on blonking ancient infrastructure, you blonking muppet -- no, wait, can't say that* -- so we're going to need to set up a test environment in parallel...  \n&gt;$customer: No.  \n&gt;Me: Wait, what?  \n&gt;$customer: We are not updating the hardware or the OS.   \n&gt;Me: Oookay, then. I am not sure what we can...  \n&gt;$customer: Why can't you just install version J of the server on a new VM and have it talk to the old clients?  \n&gt;Me: Because it won't work. They completely redesigned the database accesses between version F and version G...  \n&gt;$customer: But what if it does work?  \n&gt;Me: Er. It won't.\n\n&gt;$customer: But what if it does work?  \n&gt;Me: It won't.  \n&gt;$customer: But on the off-chance it does work? I want you to do it.  \n&gt;Me: Sir. You are the customer, and I will do my best to accede to your wishes, but I want it very clearly understood that You. Are. Wasting. Your. Money.   \n&gt;$customer: Yeah, whatever. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo, off I go. \n&gt;$customer: Here, spin up the server on $LinuxWavyHat.\n\n&gt;Me: That won't work. $software is only compatible with $LinuxDeadRat.\n\n&gt;$customer: But they're completely identical. \n\n&gt;Me: First of all, there are very minor differences. And secondly, if I encounter any issues, the first question $software_vendor is going to ask is \"what OS are you running\". And if I say \"$LinuxWavyHat\" they will tell me to go pound sand.  \n\n&gt;$customer: Well, maybe they won't...   \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTo make a long story short -- too late -- $ratticus spends 3 days fighting to install $software on $LinuxWavyHat. $ratticus runs into problems. $ratticus is told to go pound sand by $vendor. $ratticus finally convinces $customer to let him try $LinuxDeadRat, spends 2 more days fighting, and finally gets the server installed.  \nCan the server talk to the clients? Of COURSE not.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nNow I've got the bit in my teeth. I've spent a week on this stupid project. I come up with the idea of bypassing some of the server functionality and passing the data to the clients using SSH/SCP rather than the server's built-in data transfer routines. It's a Lovecraftian kludge, but it ought to work.  \n\nServer to SquinkyUX works like a charm.  However, no matter how much time I spend digging, I cannot find a version of SSH that works on $Portholes Bk.\n\n&gt;Me: I tried. It doesn't work. Here's your bill.\n\n&gt;$customer: **grumble** **mumble** waste of money **mumble** *signs bill*\n\nTL:DR; Took on a project that I knew would not work, gave it the old college try, almost succeeded, ultimately failed, got paid anyway. \n\n",

        "text": "LTL, FTP, also I think we all experienced a similar story, anyway, here it goes.\n\nThis story happended more than a decade ago. I was a training as a tech monkey, part of my training was being a T2 Supporter. Our training group was responsible for a few hundered outdated workstations and between 100 and 200 even more outdated printers, mostly HP LaserJets and DeskJets.\n\nOne merry day, when I was doing T1 support besides T2 support for a week or two, a buddy of another department called in, I took his call by pure chance.\n\n&gt; *$Me*: Good day, this is mokawede for IT Service, how may I help you today?\n\n&gt; *$Buddy*: Hey mokawede, is that you?\n\n&gt; *$Me*: Hey, *$Buddy*, yeah, it's me. What can I do for you?\n\n&gt; *$Buddy*: Yeah, we have a problem with our printer, it's broken.\n\n&gt; *$Me*: All right, what does it not do?\n\n&gt; *$Buddy*: It doesn't turn on.\n\n&gt; *$Me*: Did you press the power switch? Not the one top, but on the side of the printer?\n\n&gt; *$Buddy*: Yes of course I did that.\n\n&gt; *$Me*: Did you check the power cable, is it loose maybe?\n\n&gt; *$Buddy*: Of course I did, what do you take me for?\n\n&gt; *$Me*: Sorry, I have to make sure, you know how it is.\n\nNow it's worth mentioning that he wasn't a tech-illiterate, he could've been a formidable tech monkey.\n\n&gt; *$Me*: I'll be over in the next five minutes, will you be there then?\n\n&gt; *$Buddy*: Yeah, sure.\n\nSo printed out the ticket sheet (Yeah, we had to print the ticket onto a form, where we would write down what we did by hand. Closing a ticket meant copying everything back into the ticket system, which was a ... thing that someone clicked togehter using MS Access '97. That was so fun.), grabbed a cart and headed over to $Buddys office, internally preparing to solder some capacitors onto some pcb out of an old, dusty LaserJet 3 or 4 or 5 the next day.\n\n&gt; *$Me*: Hey there, where's that darned thing?\n\n&gt; *$Buddy*: This one.\n\nThe first thing I check is the power button, then I wobbled the cable a bit, tried again, and of course it did nothing. $Buddy glared at me.\n\n&gt; *$Me*: Sorry, standard procedure.\n\nSo I unplugged the cables, loaded the printer onto the cart, went to get the power cable and found it hadn't been plugged into the outlet. So, I plugged it into the outlet, plugged the other end into the printer, and would you look at that: It's alive, enriching the air of the office space with it's odor of hot dust!\n\nI looked at $Buddy.\n\n$Buddy looked away.\n\nI put the printer where it belonged, wrote down \"Plugged the power cable into the outlet\" onto my ticket sheet, got *$Buddy*s signature and left. We didn't talk for a week or so. He apologized later.\n\nMoral of the story: They all lie. Trust noone.",

He didn't recognize the server name, was working a more urgent problem, and asked me to create a ticket to have a Field Engineer from the vendor replace the drive.  Hey, I type fast, it'll take two minutes, tops, right?\n\nI had to do a little digital archeology, but by searching old incidents find the server's real name, and that it is an appliance used by another team.\n\nI create the ticket and **start** the description with \"Server Team does not support or have access to this server.  Contact XYZ Service Owner Joe Blow for support and access\".  Our tickets have a \"Submitted By\" and \"On Behalf of\" field; I set the latter to \"Joe Blow, XYZ Service Owner\".\n\nSo what happens 20 minutes later?  \n\n&gt; Help Desk IM:  I see your ticket, when we contact the vendor, can you escort the FE onsite?\n\n&gt; Me:  No, as the ticket says, \"Server Team does not support or have access to this server.  Contact XYZ Service Owner Joe Blow for support and access\".  Also, that data center is two states away.\n\n&gt; Help Desk: Oh, ok.\n\nAnd an hour later?\n\n&gt; Coworker at the data center:  I can't login to this server, do you have access?\n\n&gt; Me:  No, as the ticket says, it's owned by XYZ.  We shouldn't be touching this ticket, I sent it to hardware to get an FE out.\n\n&gt; Coworker: Oh, Ok. Hardware asked me to run diagnostics before they call the vendor.\n\n&gt; Me: Nope.  Not our monkeys, not our circus.\n\nTwo hours later?\n\n&gt; Level 1 Support:  I have an FE from Vendor coming out.  Are you going to escort him on site?\n\n&gt; Me:  No, You have to work with Service Owner Joe Blow.\n\n&gt; Level 1: Oh, Ok.\n\n*Lol - Coworker at the datacenter IM'd me - \"Hardware asked if I were the escort, I told them 'Joe Blow'!\"*\n\nFirst Thing This Morning?\n\n&gt; Boss:  Why are you supporting that server?  It's owned by XYZ, their team has to escort?  If one of us were to escort this guy then we take responsibility for owning the outcome...and we have nothing to do with this box. \n\n&gt; Me: Yeah, I mentioned that in the ticket that **no one reads**, and told the Help Desk, and Level 1, and Coworker told Hardware.\n\n&gt; Boss: lol!!!! They always take the path of least resistance! Well,  I just gave 'em resistance lol  :-)\n\nSo of course it's completely unsurprising that the QA department at vendor doesn't read their software's emails.\n\n",

Whenever users are in the web browser, if a page is blocked there's a link to a form to request proxy access to the URL, and of course there's room for a business reason/justification. Most of the time, these are websites for new customers that may have a low reputation since they are new, and again we'll often grant access if it's truly another business being blocked.\n\nOnce in a while, though, we get some real gems, including the usual \"I need this YouTube access for learning,\" in which case we may grant access to individual videos if it's legitimate training. Yesterday, I received my favorite proxy request and I have considered printing out the email and framing it on my cube, and this is actually the second request from this user so let's start from the first request:\n\n&gt; Business reason: JW.tv and JW.org- is my religious institute. I use the platform to enhance my theocratic studies and for moral stability. It is not for entertainment. This is my way of life.\n\nWe send out the email that this request is denied because it is not business related. My current employer does have a strict policy on what is accessed on the network, nobody said you can't watch it on your phone since users don't get the company Wi-Fi either. Our response:\n\n&gt; $IT: Due to corporate policy, this request has been denied. Proxy exceptions must be business related, and the business reason listed does not match our policies and standards. Thank you.\n\nA month later, we received what is my favorite proxy request to date, and it's even more satisfying because we simply copy and pasted our generic response to it, but...well you'll see:\n\n&gt; Business reason: This is my religion, my life.  I LOOK ON THIS SITE FOR MORAL STABILITY. NOT FOR PLEASURE. YOU CAN LOOK AT IT. IT WILL ANSWER ANY QUESTION YOU HAVE IN LIFE.\n\nI wanted to tell them that it apparently won't answer the question of why your request is being denied again, but I like keeping my job intact. Just wanted to share with you all one of my favorite business reasons ever given for access to a website.",

So my dad gets the terminals up, users are starting to test, then suddenly everything goes wiggly then dead.\n\n\nTurns out that 3 floors down they were having the opening ceremony for this brand new thing called an MRI scanner.  MRI’s and their interaction with tech hadn’t been fully studied by the hospital when they had done the install so the room wasn’t properly shielded. I think it was a year before they could use the machine. The MRI managed to wipe or damage all of the drives (those big washing-machine units of years past) as well as smoke half of the terminals.\n\n\nThe hospital management was at least sheepish about the whole event and did pay for a reinstall.",

        "text": "Had a customer bring in an Apple laptop today.\n\nThey had been putting off updating their OS to High Sierra for a few months and they were waiting at the airport to get on a flight. So they decided to download and install the update over the airport's free WiFi.\n\nWith that news all the staff who overheard gave a collective wince. Full system updates are a delicate task at the best of times, but downloading it over a free airport hotspot... not a good idea.\n\nThe update had apparently downloaded fine and the system had restarted to apply the update. The amount of time they must have spent downloading a 2-3GB update must have been a long layover, but if it downloaded fine, there might have been hope.\n\nBut then they got the call for their flight and instead of closing the unit and putting into sleep, which may have been ok, they powered it off with the power button.\n\nNow that would be bad at the best of times, however the latest macOS has a new file system for flash storage, of which all current laptops have. Updating to that new OS means that the whole partition has to be converted from the previous file system to the new one. This apparently happens at the same time as the new system files are written as well, which is why the laptop fails to boot after updating 1 in 10 even at the best of times.\n\nAfter explaining why each of her decisions probably wasn't the best choice. Thankfully she was happy enough to book it in so we can take a look at whether any information is going to be recoverable, then fix the thing. Unfortunately half failed updates need reformatting the partition if it's caught halfway in one file system and half in the other, so I'm not looking forward to the results.",

        "text": "Years ago I was working as an IT contractor doing desk side support for a large jet fighter manufacturer and one of my assigned areas was the outlying hangars. Had an issue that I couldn’t resolve remotely so I grabbed a golf cart and headed out. This particular computer was the only one against the wall out in the hangar itself, while there were two or three others inside a small attached office. Got to work on the system and by the time I was sure I was only a few minutes away from a fix, the crew had begun preparing to run an engine test on a new jet that was about 12 feet / 3.5 meters or so behind me. I could hear them getting busy so I started to hurry. I knew that thing was going to be loud! Engine fired up but I pressed on. As it got louder I eventually ended up squeezing my right ear into my shoulder so I could still use my right hand while pressing my left palm against my left ear. It was deafening and I’m sure I looked ridiculous. Before it started, I could see the entire crew had moved into the attached office wearing their ear protection and by the time it was at full volume, they were even pressing the earmuffs against their heads it was so loud. During the first lull, a crew member took pity on me and brought me some hearing protection which I greatly appreciated. The engine eventually powered down and I pulled off my earmuffs and tried to wrap up. A minute or two later, the nice guy who loaned me the ear protection walked up and said, “Here in a minute, we’re going to test the Hydrazine”. Being an IT guy and not knowing the first thing about aircraft, I came back with, “Oh great. So how loud is that going to be?” He replied, “If you’re sitting here when we do that, it’ll kill you.” Can’t imagine the look I had on my face but I told him that the machine wasn’t fixed yet but I’d be back to take care of it later.",

        "text": "So, in its heyday, Singer made a lot of machines. A LOT a lot. They issued [serial numbers](http://ismacs.net/singer_sewing_machine_company/serial-numbers/singer-sewing-machine-serial-number-database.html) in batch lots of 10,000-15,000~, every six weeks. There were frequently only a few models in production at any one time, especially in the early days, and some of those models stayed in production for decades. The [decal sets](http://ismacs.net/singer_sewing_machine_company/decals/domestic-decals.html) changed over the years, but the mechanics are identical (except in a few models where they added a reverse) from beginning to end.\n\nThat means it's not unusual for me to have two or more of the same machine in at once. I'm anal about paperwork, and that includes the check-in tags; there's space for name/contact info, make/model/serial number, plus intake notes. My tags are numbered; the claim check goes with the customer, second tear-off tag goes on the case or table if they brought one, name/model number/tag number goes on the parts bin, and the main tag stays with the machine head. I have *never*, in the years I've been doing this, gotten machines mixed up and given the wrong machine to the wrong person.\n\nBut Mr Ellison sure thought I had.\n\nI currently have four Singer 66s in the shop-two are mine, two belong to customers. Two of those-one mine, one a customer's-have red eye decals. The other two have variations of plain gold decals-similar to, but *different* from each other. Last week I had five; those four, plus Mr Ellison's, which also had yet another similar-but-different plain gold decal set.\n\nThis all started several weeks ago, when Mr Ellison brought in an absolutely filthy 66. It had apparently been sitting in his garage, for \"at least\" 40 years, without a case. Dirty doesn't begin to describe it. But it was in pretty good condition under the grime, and he wanted to give it to his daughter in good working order, so I checked it in for a full refurbishing. Part of this process is cleaning up the finish as best I can. Singer used varnish over the decals, so sometimes there's just not a lot I can do, (although if you're adventurous, there are ways) but often, a good cleaning does a world of good. Once I'd gotten most of the dirt off, I oiled the hell out of the finish. Pour it on, let it soak, hit the ugly spots gently with a toothbrush, wipe off, repeat. The end result is a clean, shiny, bright black and gold sewing machine.\n\nIt began innocuously enough. Mr Ellison came to pick up his machine and said, \"Wow! Are you sure that's mine?\" *laughs* \"It doesn't look anything like the one I brought in!\" I assured him that it was indeed his, gave him a brief rundown of my tag tracking, explained the cleaning process, and continued on. He paid me, left, then called me the next day. \"Are you *sure* this is mine?\" Yes, Mr Ellison, I'm sure. He had the tear-off carbon copy receipt from the tag (I keep the other half), so I read him the serial number on my half (which matched his half) and encouraged him to go ahead and double check with the machine. He said he would.\n\nWhat he did was spend the weekend stewing about it. When I came up to the shop Monday afternoon, he was waiting for me, his machine on he floor by the door. \"Now, I'm not accusing you of anything-mistakes do just happen. But I think you made one, and you gave me the wrong machine back. I'd like to get it straightened out.\" In the end, I had to line up all five machines on the triage table and go over them, one by one, serial number by serial number, my half of the tag-with his signature on it!-to prove that the machine he took home was the machine he brought in. He still clearly only half believed me. \"Are there more than one set of numbers on the machines you could have gotten mixed up?\" No, Mr Ellison, it's not like a VIN on a car, where the numbers are everywhere. That one brass plate is it. \"Well, if you say so. It sure doesn't look like mine, but I can't figure out how it can't be after all this. I guess maybe it was dirtier than I thought. I just knew it was black and gold.\"\n\nHe did finally take his machine back home. But I'd bet he *still* doesn't believe it's really his.\n\n",

I got sick of that life, got a degree in graphic design, and now I'm a designer.\n\nI work for a fairly low-key company. We have computers, a big switch, a hardware firewall and a business class internet connection. No IT person. We kind of just self manage our own computers, which is great for me. I don't have to ask to install VNC so I can remote in from home, I just do. I have Steam installed for the slow days. It's nice... at times.\n\nPeople at work have caught on that I'm \"good at computers.\" So now I'm defacto IT. I accept it. That is, until my primary job gets busy.\n\nToday, a chicken-pecker walked up to me. He knows I'm busy. I've been running around talking to clients and vendors and I'm sitting at my large format printer prepping files for print. I have bags under my eyes, my hair is frizzled, I haven't had lunch. He starts in, \"I know you're busy...\" I should have shut him down there. \"... but my (desktop) printer isn't working right. Can you come uninstall and reinstall?\"\n\nI know the irony in my next statement, because I'm sitting at my Cannon, 8'x10' printer. \"Dude... I hate printers...\" I really do. Printers and I don't get along. \"Can you ask Lady?\" Lady is the other \"ok at computers\" employee. She set him up in the first place.\n\n\"Well... the black isn't working right.\"\nI tell right then, \"Oh. It's not a software issue. It's a printer issue. You need new ink, or to clean the print heads, or it's broken.\" Nevermind that printers come broken by default... It's all a racket. \n\nHe then starts in with all that he's done and why he thinks I'm wrong. I'm now getting flashbacks from when I was a back on the phones being accused of lying, as if it would benefit me in some way.\n\nI eventually got him to go see Lady, but I was real close to going on a tirade on him. \n\nWhy do they ask for help if they don't like the answers?\n\ne: somewords",

        "text": "Just yesterday I received a ticket that a user couldn't print PO's in batches, only one at a time. Huh that's weird, no other users are calling at all either. No updates have been made by our software vendor for that part of the system recently. Nothing wrong with the printer queue for that system. I finally go down to the user's desk (there was celebration cake available in that area so I didn't do it remotely). \n\nShe showed me how she is printing it (types in the date and PO#) and everything looks fine. When she hits print though nothing happens instead of the normal print preview being shown. It was then that she hit me with the good old \"Yeah, this actually hasn't been working for a couple of months but I just never reported it. I figured I should report it now since we're getting busier.\" Sweet, so this workorder went from new minor inconvenience to an older issue that could slow work down now.\n\nI get my piece of cake (chocolate with white frosting, edge piece because I love frosting) and go back to my desk to investigate. I go into the database to confirm that she did actually create the PO's. I look in the folder where a copy of the print jobs are usually stored, nothing. I look at the user's session log and see that no records are being selected at all so of course nothing is going to print. Finally I resort to going into the system log to get the actual query that is being run and convert it to SQL so I can poll the database directly.  Yup, still no records. Well at least I know what the problem is and I didn't have to dig into the code to figure out what is happening this time.\n\nIn the end I finally figured out that she needs to use the date from the actual PO and not the date she created the PO. She was creating PO's for the next fiscal year so of course typing in today's date was never going to yield any records. She does this sort of work every day of the year. I suppose she probably usually creates PO's with that day's date and prints them out the same day most of the time but surely printing out a PO in advance isn't THAT unusual!\n\nOh well, at least I got cake. \n\n(If you're curious, the celebration was because the VP who is above both accounting and IT just received her doctorate degree.)",
