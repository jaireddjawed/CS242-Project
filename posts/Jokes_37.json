For six months he lives in tranquillity and isolation. Then, one day, there is a knock at the door.\n\nHe opens the door to see this huge lumberjack with a giant beard shuffling from foot to foot nervously. Eventually, the big man speaks:\n\n“I’m yer neighbor from the cabin about a mile down the road. Anyhow, I’m having a party on Saturday and I wondered if you’d like to come.”\n\nThe guy pauses for a second and then replies, “You know what, I'd love to. It's about time I got out and it would be nice to meet some new people.\"\n\n“Right,” says the lumberjack, looking a little relieved. “I’ll see you about eight o’clock on Saturday then.” And then he turns to leave.\n\nBut he pauses for a second and then turns back: “I should probably warn you, there is gonna be some pretty heavy drinking.”\n\n“Well, I’m sure that’s OK. I used to drink quite a bit myself back in the city, so I think I’ll be alright with a bit of hard liquor.”\n\n“Right then,” says the big man. “Well, eight o’clock then.”\n\nBut as he turns to go he pauses again and turns back: “Yeah, I should also mention: most likely there will also be a bit of fighting before the evening finishes.”\n\n“Uh, well, OK,” the guy replies. “I mean, I get on pretty well with most people so I don’t see that being a problem. But if it gets rough, then I'm sure I can take care of myself.”\n\n“Right then,” says the big man. “See you at eight o’clock then.”\n\nBut once again he pauses and turns back, scratching his beard: “So I probably also need to tell you: there might be some pretty wild sex.”\n\nThe guy perks up a bit at that. “Well, you know, we are all consenting adults. And after all this time out here alone, I don’t think I’d have any problem with some intimate company if that happens.”\n\n“OK then,” says the man. “Well, see you Saturday.” And with that, he turns and starts to stroll away.\n\n“Oh wait, just one question,” says the guy. “What should I wear?”\n\nThe lumberjack pauses to think, and scratches his beard again. “I don’t suppose it really matters much. I just gonna be you and me.”",

He went to the boy and said son all I can give you is this duck, but you can take it into town and see what you can get for it. So the boy grabs the duck and walks into town. As he walks into town he passes a whorehouse and one of the prostitutes leans out of the windows and yells at the boy, “hey boy, come up here and I’ll show you a good time!”\n\nThe boy said, “all I have is this duck.”\n\nShe said, “that’s fine I’ll take it.”\n\nSo he goes up and sleeps with the prostitute. When he gets done the prostitute sticks her head out the window again and says, “boy! You were so good! If you come up here again, I’ll give you your duck back.”\n\nSo he goes back up and sleeps with the prostitute again. When he gets done he’s carrying the duck in his arm and suddenly the duck jumps out of his arms and runs out into the street. \n\nAt the same time a truck happens to be driving on the road and hits the duck. The driver hops out and tells the kid he feels terrible about hitting his duck. He gives him a dollar for the dead duck. \n\nThe boy takes the dollar and heads home. His father asks him how he fared. The boy says, “well I got a fuck for a duck, a duck for a fuck, and a buck for a fucked up duck.”",
