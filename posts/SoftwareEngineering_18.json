I was put in charge of this class, but have very little engineering experience/education so I need some help. I want to have my students create an app or do some programming for one of the units, however I have no idea how to do this myself. Does anyone know of any curriculum or project that I could have my students work together in groups to create a program or app that would not need a lot of guidance from me? They usually have about 2-3 weeks of pure lab time where they just work on their projects, where they would be designing and programming their app. My school also does not have a ton of resources, so anything that has a minimal cost would be ideal. Like I said, I have very little experience with this, so ANY input would be great! Thanks!",

Therefore,  All the design choices are left to me. That piece of software is slowly growing to support different operating systems, GPUs, CPU's and DSP chips. Each time a new requirement is brought up I go back to rewriting a significant portion of the code because I didn't have code that is well designed/loosely coupled. I have been looking at Tensorflow's code recently and I noticed that the smallest details such as tensor shape are represented by classes abstracting the implementation details (personally I would have just put  a c++ vector in tensor class and called it a day). What resources can I use to improve my software design skills since the project is starting to grow to the extend that I can no longer finish a task in time while rewriting the existing code to adapt to the new requirements. I initially thought reading through tensor-flow code is a good idea but the code-base is huge and hard to fathom.  Am in hurry to finish upcoming features therefore I can't afford to continue trying to understand such a large project to see how proper software engineering is done given that am already working close to 100 hours a week to learn about how to deal with the new hardware.",

        "text": "Hello peeps, new to this side. I don’t have any programming exp with PCs but I love PCs themselves. I used to play on pcsx2 not too long ago and when looking at the start up tab I’d always be fascinated with the code and try to decipher what’s going on. It was plenty explanatory but I didn’t get into it that much further.\nFirstly, I’m trying to set off on a path to become an engineer but the paths I’m choosing is either self taught or community college(projects on the side) as well as working. Problem I haven’t even dabbled in calculus. I used to be in college but it was for graphic design which I grew out of. Now I’m looking for a job that I can tolerate or enjoy, while making a decent living. \nNever going to marry or have a gf so salary isn’t so much of an issue. Having a life outside of work doesn’t hurt either. I live in Pennsylvania and I hate philly unless it’s Northeast. It’s too expensive to live there though unless I make a decent salary and the job has a decent commute. Willing to relocate if necessary, have no one to tie me down. To be quite frank I’m a hardcore pc gamer with many hobbies, my drive and motivation are uncanny when I’m in the zone with anything I’m doing.\nAs of right now, I have a totaled car I’m paying off, getting a car later on from my mom that’s paid off. Working a job from 1pm-9pm doing data entry which isn’t too bad but the hours suck and the managers don’t really care for you. I literally sit for an hour or two with nothing to do and nothing is said. I even ask for more work but the guy shrug me off. Well it’s only $10 with no raises ever so I’m fine with that. \nWhen it all comes down to it, I have the passion and the drive. I just don’t have the path to walk down on, it’s either self taught or community college which isn’t too far from me actually, about 10 minutes or less away by car.\nAdvice will be much appreciated.\nEdit: Also, networking I heard is important.",

        "text": "Two days ago I started a new entry level job in a factory. Up until my first day there, the prospect of working there didn't seem so bad because I had pretty much avoiding even thinking about it. Throughout the day, however, the reality of it came flooding in and the only way I could keep going was by promising myself that I'd quit and find something else to do.\n\nSkip this part if you don't want to hear my life story. At first I was just going to write a little background info but ended up venting a bit. If you're interested feel free to read it.\n----------------------------\nAfter high school I went to a large state college with a vague idea of majoring in chemistry. Throughout my 1 year there I changed plans several times and failed to find much purpose and motivation to learn and make grades before completely giving up during the second semester and failing out. \n\nAfter moving back home and doing almost nothing for about a year, I got a seasonal job at at a mail delivery company. I fell in love with the idea of becoming a driver for them and eventually got a part time position there. It was physically demanding work with little pay and a long commute, but I put a lot of effort into showing up on time every day and impressing the supervisors. After being there for less than a year I got the opportunity to move up to becoming a delivery driver. All I had to do was go across the country for a week for training, which I had pretty much already done a cheaper local version of once before for a seasonal position. Well, I failed the driving exam and was sent home to return to my part time job. I'm not going to get it into too much, but the system they had in place for training felt odd from the beginning and I was suspicious of the reasoning for failing. I decided to quit before going into work on Monday. I'm still unsure of whether that was a good decision or not, but at the time I believed they were stringing me along to keep me part time without much interest in moving me to full time. If I were to do it over I wouldn't have quit immediately.\n\nThis was only a few months ago, and since then I had been working for my dad's lawn care company. I had been planning on moving out of my parents' house after getting the delivery driver job, but since that didn't pan out I had become pretty aimless again. I would take advantage of the fact my dad won't fire me to a ridiculous extent and often stayed up drinking and playing video games on weekdays, only working barely half a day or sometimes not at all. Most of the time I was pretty satisfied with this lifestyle to be honest, but there were moments of clarity where it really hit me that I'm wasting my life and destroying my health. A friend had been offering to get me in at a factory for a while now, and when he brought it up again a couple weeks ago I thought I'd just go for it since it would at least make me cut way back on my bad habits, and maybe I would eventually make enough to support myself if it worked out well.\n\nSo I went ahead and applied, went through the hiring process, etc., it all went really fast actually, and I was set to start on the next Monday less than 2 weeks before I had even considered getting a new job. Almost immediately after applying I start getting a bad feeling whenever I think about working there. This led to just avoiding thinking about it. When Monday rolls around and I have to get out of bed, the blast of reality I so badly needed comes crashing in. Not something that hasn't happened before, but this time I'm forced to spend the next 10 hours in a place I don't want to be, thinking about why I'm here and how I might be able to improve my situation. At first I really just wanted to go back to being a lazy ass. I consider just finishing the day and quitting, but I would be screwing over the friend that got me job, which I certainly didn't want to do. Since there was no easy way out, I ended up really thinking through things that were pushed to the back of my mind. \n\nGoing back to school. Never out of the question, but I was only going to go back if I found a clear path. I think about all of the majors I looked at in high school and college, and realize first of all, that I never put enough effort into finding out about them. I also realize that I had brushed aside working with computers and coding, even though when I was younger I really into that kind of stuff. It was out of a childish fear of being a nerd or something like that. Now after spending several hours reading about the kind of work software engineers do I've become very interested in this idea.\n----------------------------\n\nHaving not actually pursued anything computer related nor ever actually coded a purposeful piece of software, I want to make sure that this is really something I can get into before deciding to start committing to it. What would you recommend I start learning on my own to help gauge my interest and ability?",

(considering the severity of the pain, and my issues with the current workstation, 4-6 weeks feels like a very long time for me)\n\nIf it is going to take that long, I'll need to ask for some accommodations in the interim (I really cant work at the current workstation for more than 5 minutes at time).

It was a bit of a challenge at the start for me as I did not understand what terms like mount means. I am focusing on JavaScript and installation of Development environment was a pain in the ass on windows while things felt more solid and smooth on Ubuntu (nodejs, npm, git). Thanks to the Ubuntu community for helping out newcomers! Currently, I consider myself a pro-beginner user (can install packages, use command line, etc) and I'd like to share the resources that helped to advance in the past months:\n\n1. [askubuntu.com](https://askubuntu.com/) answered most of my questions (many answers are already there) and provided quick solutions to my Ubuntu Linux issues\n2. I watched multiple videos and followed **blog**s like [digitalocean.com](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials) for various installation tutorials\n3. [linuxjourney.com](https://linuxjourney.com/) helped me to get an overview and reference\n4. [linux-command-line-for-beginners](https://www.udemy.com/linux-command-line-for-beginners-42/?couponCode=SOCIAL-NETWORK) I got this **video course** on Udemy for a discount price from a friend (the discount offer looks still valid - you get it for a cheap price \\~10$) . It helped me with Linux shell commands. Highly recommended.\n5. [How-Linux-Works](https://www.amazon.com/How-Linux-Works-2nd-Superuser/dp/1593275676/ref=la_B0045A0OHU_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1530208941&amp;sr=1-1) is a **good read**. Helped to understand what Linux OS is (read 70&amp;#37; of it). Very Highly recommended!\n\n*If there are more beginner oriented resources, please share. Thanks!*  ",

I have a few reservations and questions, and it'd be great if someone could address some or all of them.\n\n1. My posture is already some-what bad for an 18 year old because I'm on the computer almost all day when I can, can this be viewed as a down-side of Software engineering ? Is it normal to use the computer for large periods of time in other careers ?\n2. How can I make a decision as to which engineering major I should take - information is all over the place online.\n3. Any reasons for which you don't like software engineering in general/ or compared to other engineering disciplines\n4. Anyone who has changed engineering majors, could you give insight on the difference ? Even if brief.\n\nThanks.",

        "text": "Hi,\n\nI graduated with a degree in Mechanical Engineering a few years ago and have been working in a Project Engineering role since. \n\nI use a lot of excel in my current job and have been making and have taught myself VBA fairly competently and code that I'm writing is getting increasingly complex (I understand it's probably not very complex for Software Engineers). This is the part of my job I enjoy most and feel it would be a good idea to utilise this.\n\nA combination of not being wholly content with Mechanical Engineering and enjoying the coding side of what I'm doing makes me feel that moving into software engineering would be a positive move.\n\nI've had a look at Open University courses and various other HNCs, HNDs etc, but with the countless resources online, is doing a formal qualification strictly necessary? Or is anyone aware of convsersion courses from BEng Mechanical Engineering to software engineering?\n\nThanks in advance",
