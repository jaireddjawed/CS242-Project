        "text": "If anyone knows, there was a podcast called Life After that came out about a year ago. It was a story podcast that followed a guy named Ross who lost his wife. He was approached by a new technology similar to the one in Be Right Back where it would emulate the voice of the deceased and you could have a conversation with them. \n\nThey used information from social media to create a personality that would respond just like the deceased. It was weird to watch the episode because I had listened to the podcast and it was like a double take. \n\nIf you haven't heard of the podcast before and you like Black Mirror, I definitely recommend.",

        "text": "Maybe this could be a coincidence but I doubt it. But has anyone noticed the use of the song that runs through the whole series (Anyone Who Knows What Love Is- by Irma Thomas) has been used significantly more since the series has come out? \n\nNow this may be the case of those times where you notice something and suddenly you see that thing everywhere. But, this song has been appearing in other works where actors from Black Mirror have appeared. \n\nFor example, Bryce Dallas Howard who you’d know as Lacie in Nosedive, is also in Jurassic World. The first one of which she was in before Black Mirror was out I believe. But the second one’s trailer was released (which I saw as a preview during Black Panther) and it had *the* song. \n\nLink: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=XsHOBsPWafo \n\nAlso to mention, in the episode White Christmas (this is where spoilers come in!),\n\nI can’t remember his name, I believe it was Tim, I’ll refer to him as that name until I can remember. But there was an  actor who played the coworker, that was cheating with the wife on Rafe Spalls’ character; and recently I’ve seen a movie trailer that included ”Tim”. It’s a trailer I’ve only seen on YouTube, and pretty short. From what I can remember (because I haven’t been able to track down the trailer) , the movie was about a mixed racial family, and the siblings of said family and I believe he played one of them. At one point a character asks “Tim’s”  character is all these siblings of different races are actually siblings. But the important part is the trailer also included the song! It’s the only reason I watched the ad which I usually skip. \n\nI don’t know if I’m pulling at straws here, but it seems like an interesting connection. I don’t think that this song is actually linking these movies together, or that they are tied into the Black Mirror universe. But it seems more like a nice nod or sort of Easter egg to catch people’s attention who do notice it. It definitely caught mine! \n\n\nSo, thoughts? \n\n(Also if anyone can find that trailer from my vague description that would be great) ",

        "text": "This episode sucked.\n\nMy problems:\n\n1.  The first 20 minutes of the episode has nothing to do with future technology.  I really like the Black Mirror series, because most (if not all) of the episodes revolve around futuristic technology that seems realistic in a futuristic context.  Only until the insurance adjuster enters the story does futuristic technology play a role with the memory recorder.  But even then the technology did not play an integral part of the story.  The plot could have been set in any time and didn't require the memory recorder, which made me feel like I was watching just some fucked up show and not Black Mirror.\n\n2.  During the first cover up of the bicycle accident, the man pressures his girlfriend into dumping the body.  She didn't want to do it, but then 15 years later she is capable of murdering her ex-boyfriend because he wants to write an anonymous letter even when he says \"I wont mention you\"?  How would they trace an anonymous letter?  Sorry, the moment she turned into a murderer didn't feel believable to me.  It just seemed to me like she panicked for no reason.  \n\n3.  What the fuck happened in that scuffle?  Im sorry, this tiny woman is just hugging this man, who wasn't drinking, SHE WAS DRINKING, and somehow causes him hit the wall and fall with enough force to cause his brain to hemorrhage or something???  Then chokes him out with her forearm while on top?  Total bullshit.  When the guy died and it was over I just laughed because it was so absurd.\n\n4.  Her character is supposed to be intelligent and successful, yet she makes the absolute dumbest decisions every time she decides to commit ANOTHER murder and turns the situation into a worst case scenario every time where she needs to dump another body.  Each time the character decided to kill somebody else, it just felt like the show trying too hard to be disturbing to the viewer no matter if nothing about the plot justified the character to act in such a way.  How in the fuck did this woman think she could cover up all these dead bodies when she was already nervous about a fucking anonymous letter that wouldn't mention her?  \n\n5.  This woman kills a baby?  Seriously just get the fuck out of here.  Ok, the most hardened criminals to ever walk the planet are scarcely capable of such an act.  But now in this story, basically a soccer mom who once was pressured into dumping a body she had no hand in killing, is now capable of committing four premeditated gruesome murders in a span of about 48 hours including the murder of a small child.  Utter absurdity.\n\nThis episode pissed me off on so many levels.  End rant.",

It's a look into the actual unknown, in darkly prophetic terms. It feels so harrowing because a lot of the topics resonate within us in a way.

That's quite ominous, but it's not the first time \"black mirrors\" have been used in societies, yet the cool fact (and my point of view) is their purpose has actually always been the same, even to the degree that Charlie Brooker portrays the message(s) through the show.\n\nIn terms of history, black mirrors were made of polished obsidian glass (volcanic rock), and were first brought back by Hernando Cortés in 1530 after his conquest of Mexico. The Aztec priests used them to conjure visions and make prophesies of the future. Obsidian mirrors were used ritually to spiritually access the Aztec underworld and communicate with the realm of the dead. They were said to be used for a ruler to see the future, and for others to see themselves look back at them.\n\nLater, John Dee, with the help of a psychic-medium (and convicted criminal) Edward Kelley, had conversations and visions of angels in the mirror’s reflective surface, creating what is known as the \"Ennochian\" language, said to be the precursor to ancient Hebrew, and the language that God used to speak to Adam. These angels (or perhaps demons) requested certain real-world things happen, in payment for the information they imparted. These acts and requests became more and more deprived towards the end of Dee's experimentation.\n\nThis is very occult, with little known about what, if anything, was found to be true. Dee believed that this practice would result in the the beings/angels contacted through the mirror, having knowledge that would aid the English in the domination of the known (and at that time, unknown world). Essentially, he sought information that he could use to guide the future. Interestingly, Dee has since been suggested to be a spy for Queen Elizabeth I, and part of the original MI5, and signed his letters with the signature '007'.\n\nDee would eventually force Kelley to stare into the mirror for long 'scrying' sessions, pushing him to the edge of madness, if not deep into the territory of it.\n\nIn summary, black mirrors are said to be a tool of prophesy, but if one looks too hard into them, for too long, madness awaits, and the looker may be consumed by their visions of the possible. In this respect, it may be argued that a black mirror is nothing but the reflection of one's soul in that, it is what the soul wants without heeding any danger (or listening too closely without caution) towards something fundamentally uncertain, and will likely result in a terrible state of reality for them. They spring forth warnings of what may be, possibly even will be.\n\nIn my opinion, whether Charlie Brooker knew of this history or not, he nails this.",

        "text": "One of the main themes in Black Mirror includes violating a human’s right to lie. We see police use cookies of someone’s consciousness to get a confession (White Christmas), and a husband look through a wife’s memories to see if she cheated (The Entire History of You) and a mother with the ability to see everything her child sees (including some underage sex, [Arkangel])\n\nIt seems this is one of the main problems in the Black Mirror universe. For example, in White Christmas, we see a cookie of someone’s consciousness is used to force out a confession. Yes, he confessed- and that is valid proof of a crime, but is it morally right? Should humans have a right to lie without investigators forcing themselves into their thoughts?\n\nAgainst-will confessions. Not many people are for this, even religion. As we see in Christianity, people are still supposed to ‘confess’ their sins to God. They’re taught that even if God is God, the almighty, they still must confess our sins to him to receive forgiveness. \n-\nBut are we really that far from this? We already have lie detectors and polygraphs, which are now only voluntary (at least for Americans), which instead of trusting a persons word, use blood pressure to determine if they are telling the truth. \n\nThere are already multiple universities studying [‘recording’ dreams](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.psychologytoday.com/blog/dream-factory/201709/animating-dreams-and-the-future-dream-recording%3famp), essentially being able to access a persons subconscious thoughts. \nAs well as a Utah-based startup developing an extremely accurate [lie detector](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2017/10/10/converus-lie-detector-uses-eye-tracking.html) that tracks eye movement using AI, eliminating the need for attaching polygraphs to the body, allowing someone to undergo a lie detector without ever knowing. \n\nSo, what does Reddit think? Do humans have a right to lie about their own actions and thoughts if they can’t be proven? Or should we be able to step into people’s minds to convict a murderer? There’s a lot of situations to think about. Then put yourself in their shoes. \n",
