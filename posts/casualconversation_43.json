        "text": "A few days ago, I had the craziest dream, and for some reason I can’t seem to forget it. Probably because it was SO weird. As for a little bit of back story, since my wife and I have been together, I’ve really gotten her into sushi, and she’s open to try everything at least once, but one thing she’s never had and refuses to try is shrimp. She also makes it very clear that she will never try it. Anyways the night before, she brought some dinner home. Her entrée was salmon patties, and mine was coconut shrimp. I couldn’t get over how amazing my shrimp was, so I made a comment to her that these are different, and she should give one a try. As she rejected the offer, I was thinking how it’s weird that she rejects shrimp due to its texture, but she’s willing to try squid and octopus when we get sushi.\n\nSo from what I remember of the dream is that it takes place in some restaurant, and this restaurant specializes in octopus that’s so fresh, it comes out while it’s still alive. I remember that the waiters serve it to to, and the upper round part of the body is about the size of a basketball, and the tentacles just drapes off of the plate. Once your about to eat it, it’s custom to get your fork and drive it through the octopus’s head and kill it, so you can freshly eat it. Well a lot of the times if people didn’t kill it fast enough, it would escape off the plate and go off the table. If this happened, than once they hit the floor, somehow they turn into a snake, and slither off. Once thing I remember very clearly is that they would turn into a black and orange snake, like a small Bismarck Ringed Python. Once they would take off, they would slither off towards the walls, and hide in the crevices of where the floor meets up with the wall. At this point I remember looking into all these crevices, and you would see hundreds of these snakes all piled up inside that have escaped. At that point, I don’t remember if you were served a second Octopus, or if you were just out of luck.\n\nOnce I woke up, I was so creeped out for the first part of the day. The thought of all those snakes piled up in the cracks and crevices just kept playing over and over in my head.",

        "text": "for the speculation below i take that ***not acting evil = acting kind*** and also that ***acting kind =/= being kind.*** now to answer the question...\n\n1. conscience? say a person has a strong conscience and when they do something they consider morally wrong it's really bugging them. that prevents them from acting mean and cruel even when they really want to. that results in an inner conflict, because the person is restrained by their own conscience, unable to act on their wishes, but people only see what's on the outside so the person is considered kind\n2. say a person has principles. and when they have a choice to act mean, they're like \"okay, even though it's not gonna hurt me, it's gonna hurt the other person so no thanks\". now i personally think this is closer to actually being kind, because this person COULD choose to fuck everyone but they choose to bring smth good to the world\n3. being empathetic. the reason you act nice is not because you can't handle the feeling of guilt, not because you just don't want to, but because you can't handle feeling the other person's pain when you cause it. idrk what to add\n\nwhat do you think",

So I have no specific schedule to stick to. However, I find that a lot of the stuff I need to get done is best done during the day. The issue is, with my lack of schedules, it's been crazy hard to get up with much day to use. I've basically become nocturnal. I mean, 4:00am has become a regular time for me to finally lay down.\n\nBut, I got lucky. The night before last, I actually went to sleep and got up when I intended. Great! And last night, I did stay up about an hour late, but still really close to when I intended to go yo sleep. But, for some reason, I didn't feel I slept well last night and let myself lay in bed. Almost an extra 4:00 hours. Now, I really wanna go to sleep at least close to the right time tonight to try and keep my schedule. However, with the late start I gave myself, I suspect I'll have trouble going to sleep when I intend to.\nI can't take any medication for sleep because of health issues I have. Just gotta rely on my body to be good to go to sleep.\nAny tips?\nThank you!",

But she sits next to me in class and I think I caught her bug . I feel really sad and fed up because anxiety’s gone up that I’m gonna be sick all week because it’s are 1 week holiday next week and I really hope I’m not sick all holiday because I’ve been sick for the past 3 weekends . Like getting over my bug then getting another one. I’m fed up. We were all saying on Friday. I don’t want that bug and are teacher said. Sometimes you make yourself sick by worrying you’ll get the bug and you develop the bug. Now I didn’t believe her but I’m actually very worried about developing colds all the time I just thought of that. I ended developing it, didn’t I? My sister told me to stop doing something and I laugh uncontrollably. When I eventually stopped. I started crying which she didn’t notice. Something I wouldn’t usually cry about. Then when she left the room I started crying on and off. I have calmed down but my anxiety building. I’ve been so done with fucking school for a long time I just don’t want to feel like I did at school and these past couple of weekends. Although I feel like I’m gonna have a massive meltdown. I’ve been feeling like this for weeks now. I could talk to my friends but I don’t want to speak to my friends because I don’t feel like talking and I don’t wanna speak to my friends in this sorta mood. I’m angry one friend for giving me the bug even tho it’s obviously not her fault. She can’t help it. But now I’m angry at my other friends and I don’t know why. So I’m gonna just leave them alone for today. Just to be clear I’m an anti therapy person so if anyone wants offer me that kinda advice. but I just wanna have a normal conversation. Not about my issues. Though I don’t think anyone will answer me for a long time yet or at all.\n\nThe reason why I said this is because I originally posted this on serious conversation. I know it’s not really a casual conversation though I saw another person wanting a casual conversation too and who had issues too and I don’t think they mentioned her mental health issues as well so I just tweaked my post a little bit. It’s my first time being on this sub btw",

        "text": "Hi there!  \n\n\nWhen I was still in school, I was always the pretty shy and quiet student in class, who rarely raised their hand. It almost always took a bit of effort to say anything in class, and when I did I mostly used as few sentences as possible.\n\nAfter school I got a bit less anxious, though many problems still remained. I rarely approached new people and also had trouble keeping up a conversation with anyone, who isn't one of my closer friends. Going to the barber, writing an email or asking an employee in a shop for something always took a lot of effort, which is why I avoided doing any of these things if possible.\n\nBut over the last weeks something changed. I don't know what exactly happened, but it happened. I now have way less trouble in having small talk with anybody. Previously, I very quickly ran out of things to say. Now, most of the time I find the right words to keep the conversation going without awkward silences.\n\nI am going to university and rarely said anything in class there, but this semester I do and I keep cool while talking. Sometimes I even make little jokes, something I didn't think I could do with a room full of people.\n\nLast week I had to write two fairly important emails, one was asking a professor if he can help me in finding a topic for my bachelor's thesis. I was stressed out had to mentally prepare writing this one. And I clicked send on this mail fairly quickly. I was nervous, of course, but I am proud that I can do this task now, without week-long overthinking and waiting until the last possible moment before finally committing.\n\nThis week I was sick but I had to write an exam. Without much hesitation, I wrote an email to my instructor saying I was too sick to attend class. Afterwards I went straight to the doctor to get a sick note. I have never went to the doctor alone before and I was pleasantly surprised that this barrier was now easy to cross, too.\n\nOf course, there are some things I still can't do (yet!). I still hate it to call someone, I still have problems approaching people and I still have trouble keeping eye contact in a conversation. But these are things I can fix hopefully soon.\n\nSo yeah, I am proud of my recent accomplishments and I hope you, random stranger on the Internet, found a little joy reading this story of me slowly becoming a functioning member of society :D.",

As I was installing the cord through the firewall etc., they helped with absolutely NOTHING, I did it all myself as they were worrying about how CLEAN their own car was. I had to get one of my other friends to inspect everything for me too cuz this person just WOULD NOT help when I installed everything. (Also even if they were telling me to be careful, why didn't they just watch me do it if they were so worried?)\n\nToday I'm going to install everything fully with this \"friend\" messaging me saying they will not be helping me today for whatever reason, and I feel like there is a strong sense of jealousy, or something.\n\nAnyone have any advice?

I discussed everything with my major advisor in the university that I applied and also my current college to make sure that my transfer plan was smooth. They both said it’s good, cool. And my plan is applying, getting accepted, finishing everything left till July, and transferring. It’s been smooth until last night, I received an email from the university’s international admission office said that: “The acceptance letter is a huge mistake so I will have to rescind your admission next week.” I can feel that my entire day collapse. My mind is completely blown at that moment. I haven’t told my family about this yet. My family has been so proud, so excited and now I don’t want to make them feel bad.

This is probably the answer to my question, just improve your social skills, but I want to delve further.  \n\n\nOne of the few things that I noticed in myself are those:  \n\\- Things get absolutely awkward when someone says something to me and I don't understand what they are saying, they repeat it a few more times and I still have no idea what they are talking about and asking it again just makes things more awkward. And there are certain times that someone explains something to me, tells me what to do, I hear it, but I have problems understanding it clearly, maybe because my brain just ignores what they are saying and focuses on the moment itself instead of what's being told to me\n\n\\- I make a lot of useless comments on things, a bit similar to talking just for the sake of having muttered a few words, so you have contribution to the whole topic, but not exactly because I think those things that I say might be useful, although a slim chance, and I just speak those words out without thinking whether it is useful or not. And after this process, obviously nobody else cares, and it gets even more awkward, and on top of that I acknowledge that the things that i've said are useless.  \n\n\nIt's probably not on me completely, but I certainly have a major contributing factor, and for context the psychiatrist that I went to said that I might have anxiety, and I do too in fact think that I have anxiety.",

I’m almost 21 and I feel so behind all of my friends and peers for having no experience in this area and I’m worried that when I do find someone, it’s gonna suck not even knowing what to do or how to act because experience is at this point expected of me because of my age. Valentine’s Day just reminds me of this every year. \n\nThis leads into my other problem. I turn 21 a couple days after Valentine’s Day, so still this week, and I have nothing to look forward to. 21 is supposed to be a milestone birthday and I only have my parents to celebrate with. All of my friends either live out of state or are going to be busy, and even then, I don’t have that many in the first place because I’ve been having some problems making friends since I started college. I’m taking a break this semester, so I’m not even going to be at least around other people my age. My parents said they’d celebrate with me but just cause I have no one else to be with. Last year, most everyone in my life forgot it was my birthday so I didn’t even get any “happy birthdays” except from a couple older family members and one girl I literally haven’t seen in 10 years. My friends forgot my birthday but not someone I was friends with in elementary school in another state? That didn’t feel great. I’m expecting basically the same thing to happen this year even though it’s a milestone but I just feel like my life is basically meaningless and irrelevant right now. My brothers can’t even come home to be with me and we have the same birthday, they have stuff planned with their own friends. \n\nAnyway, life kinda sucks for me rn and has for a bit but like I said this week is gonna be hard for me. I know there’s so many worse things happening to other people all over the world and compared to some of those things, mine is nothing, so I haven’t told anyone how upset I’ve been about this but i just had to tell someone, even if it’s like 5 strangers on Reddit.",

It's like real time anger at impending irrelevance. I'm a 35 year old man and like what I like, so I'm not going to worry about a popular culture that, frankly, isn't for me anymore. Leave the kids alone damn it!",

        "text": "It's like falling in love with the two characters. A fictional romance can be very well written and I will almost always still go about my day as usual. But sometimes, like once in every couple years something just clicks while watching two characters interact. And I have no idea about the reasons, I don't think they have better chemistry than most or they are that much better written. Hell, their relationship can even be a small sidestory that barely gets focus in the story. And yet this all too familiar fluffy feeling manifests in me and I just want to see more of the pair doing whatever together.\n\nI found like 3-4 fictional couples in the last 10 years or so. Anybody else had similar experiences?",

I wish I could be someone else and see the world in their eyes. I wish I could experience falling in love in different ways with different people. I wish I could see every part of the world and meet all the people who would have loved me.\n\nIt sucks because I think this is the only life we got. I'm disabled and can't do much with my life now. All do is dream about what I could have done or what could have been.",

        "text": "Hello!\n\nLong time lurker first time poster. I have been working on something for what feels like years now, I feel like I finally have something I like but every time I go back to it I just wana scrap everything. \n\nI’m quite depressed, and have been for some time, and that is the driving force in my work. I just wish I could put it out into the world but I am deathly afraid of what people may think about me or my work. It’s very personal and telling, so it’s hard to want to attach my name to it, and in today’s world the creation is no longer enough. Now you need to make content that promotes the actual content that you wanted to create in the first place. Idk where I am going with this but I just wanted to type something out. \n\nTo add to all of this, it’s hard to get feedback on something that you are afraid to share with those closest to you. I fear the judgement. I feel like I’ve made huge strides in my work and I am so proud of it, but at the same time it is daunting to want to share something so personal to me. \n\nAnyways… thats my rant about the creative pressure I put on myself. I’m even afraid of people reading this tbh but I had to write something out. Ok bye have a good Saturday love you all.",
