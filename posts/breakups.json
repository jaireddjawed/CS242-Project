Unintentionally (or intentionally) letting those they left feel like they don't matter or that their relationship don't matter.

I (24M) dated my ex (23F) for 10 months, 7 months were long distance. The first 4 months was amazing and thought about proposing and was going to start planning on when and how, since it would be further down the road so it could be even more planned and special. I love her family so much and wanted that so bad, it was nothing of a family that I have experienced before in a relationship. Then problems started to hit, so I held back to analyze more of the situation before making this huge commitment.\n    Minor problems became big problems. It started with not talking to her enough (I work 10 hour days and right when I get off work I will talk to her until I go to bed, I like to watch 1 hour of TV to decompress sometime in that duration). It came to her being upset of not texting her enough at work. I couldn\u2019t like ANY girls pictures my age, not even cousins or girls wedding pictures\/family pictures that are from highschool or college, etc. My location, Snapchat score, Facebook \u201cactive\u201d was stalked pretty much nonstop. It came to the point that I could not be trusted. Mind you that I have NEVER cheated at all in my life, never gave a reason for her to not trust me. It\u2019s a terrible feeling as I have been cheated on 3 times already, I would not want to give anyone that type of feeling.\n    As I am not perfect, she is not the only one to blame for all of the problems. It is definitely shared, we have argued a lot regarding my faults of being upset easily and not showing enough emotion within situations. Comments that have been said, from both parties that should have not been said. There were arguments that would last until 2am, I wake up at 4:40 for work, it was draining and exhausting. I did it because I loved her and wanted her.\n    That had a factor to do as well as a financial factor. She didn\u2019t have a job when we started dating, which was fine, she had a goal and strived to get a position in realty. That switched to something else, then again and again. She was perfectly fine staying at home to do nothing, not search for work and not advance in a path of a job she would love. I helped create a resume for her and helped make an account on indeed\/other job apps and telling her jobs that she was interested in that were open to apply. There was nothing, she would sleep till 12pm regularly. Which is why she could argue past 2am. My job pays well, but not enough to live for more than just ourselves unless her and I wanted to go paycheck to paycheck and make zero growth on getting a house, paying off debt, etc.\n    I wanted it to work because I loved her and her family, I wanted to have something like that for the rest of my life because family is everything and now I have that with a beautiful girl. It came down to that I loved her family more than I loved her. My love was fading away with her and I cannot marry someone just to have their family. Financially was not driven to work or try to provide for a future family. So I broke things off. I truly miss her and I think I made a huge mistake in that process because I lost a friend and a family of friends that I grew with. So was it right to break things off? Will I be be better off? Will I find a family like that again with another relationship?\n\nTl:dr; Did I make the wrong mistake of breaking things off","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678729888.0},{"title":"Finally moving on","author":"suzzieboo","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/BreakUps\/comments\/11qgb4w\/finally_moving_on\/","text":"We broke up in 2018. I was DEVASTATED. Our relationship was extremely toxic after dating for nearly 3 years. You hated me, I hated you - yet somehow we still stuck together. \n\nI knew I wanted to grow as a person, and a partner. I wanted it with you. When I proposed the idea of us having a happy\/healthy, relationship, you said, \u201cI don\u2019t know if I can do that.\u201d I remember being baffled at the time, but I genuinely understand now. \n\nWe both dated different people but would somehow reconnect here and there. \n\nAll I wanted was you, once upon a time ago.

I haven\u2019t heard from you since 2020 (well I blocked you). I\u2019ve been single since 2020, apparently you broke up with your ex late 2021. \n\nI get a random message from a text now number. It\u2019s an inappropriate degrading message, I know it\u2019s you. I tell you to leave me alone, I\u2019m on vacation. \n\nA month later, I text you asking what\u2019s up while I was drinking at a concert. In all honesty, you were the last person I hooked up with (back in 2020) and I just really wanted to fuck. I didn\u2019t beat around the bush. I was blunt. We obv met up later that night and it was great. \n\nThe next day I tell you I don\u2019t want to continue talking and block you again. \n\nThroughout summer, I block you. You call me from random numbers. We hang out. You tell me you want to be business partners and that we should basically get married and you don\u2019t care if I see other people. I decline. \n\nAugust rolls around. You get into some legal trouble and ask for my assistance, bc you love how \u201cresourceful\u201d of a person I am. (Good w figuring it out). \n\nI advise that I\u2019m not a lawyer and that I cannot help you. We get into a petty argument and you degrade me out of context, speaking lies about what I said I would do or what I\u2019ve done. \n\nIn the midst of that argument it hit me. YOU NEVER LOVED ME. If you believe that is my character and I would do the things you said I\u2019ve done - I CANNOT fwu. How can I have someone in my corner that feels that type of way about me? I don\u2019t wish to keekee with the enemy. \n\nLearning that you never loved me was the final piece I needed to move on from the situation forever. Wish I had opened my eyes earlier.

Less than a month after she said that, she left me for somebody else.\n\nAt the time, I didn't have the wonderful friends that I have now, and I did not have the luxury of talking to a professional to help me process the trauma.

Yes, there is infatuation and adoration and respect that all help facilitate love, but loving is a choice you make everyday. To love that person the way they need. But you aren't a mind reader and there is no \"one size fits all\" way to love. Thus it is on the individual to ask for and tell you as their partner what they need to feel loved and cared for. How can they do that if they don't know what they need? How can you respond adequately if you are flying blind? Before incompatibility\/compatibility becomes even a question comes communication. Can your partner communicate to you their needs? If they can't, there's not really a fault, but that relationship can never work because someone will always be trying and failing despite not knowing what test they are taking. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou cannot be responsible for someone else's personal healing journey.

She made me laugh and smile during a time where I was not doing so well. I asked her to be my girlfriend a month later after we graduated we both moved back home to our hometown, still living with our individual families, both being muslim.\n\nThe first couple of years were a dream - I helped her with mental health issues that she opened up to me about and pushed her to get therapy and psychiatric help she needed. I helped her move on from her receptionist job to something that used her degree, even if it was over an hour away from her with traffic. I made the effort to go meet up with her after work as much as I could, even meeting her near her workplace so she wouldn't have to drive somewhere closer to me and could instead just get in her car and go straight home after we were done. \n\nThen.. it got worse. We started arguing, she started mentioning I wasn't always there for her or not very emotionally present.. which was true, growing up in a very sheltered household a lot of things she experienced were very new to me.. I could barely describe my own emotions besides \"happy\" or \"sad\", and only after a year of therapy myself have I realized how to properly express how I feel. I tried my best to be there for her, but she held onto the times I wasn't - whether thats because I was at work, or stuck with a prior obligation. Sometimes even if I offered to give her a call as soon as I was available or meet up with her the next day - it wasnt okay for her because I didnt do what she wanted right then and there. Other things she started to get upset about was me not calling her every day (the only time frame I had to call her was after work and before she got home - which I might not be available for every day myself), not making the effort to see her multiple times a week, not making conversation besides small talk (which was hard sometimes because she refused to engage with me). \n\nAt that point it started to get stretched pretty thin. I never asked her for anything. Ever. I was happy being with her the way she was. She wasn't perfect. She was perpetually late, and I'm very punctual. I learned to be okay with that. She expected me to be there for her all the time but I never asked for that. I was okay with that, she had a lot more mental health issues than me. I could manage my issues myself. She was hotheaded - she had a temper when things didnt go exactly how she wanted, whether with me or her family, friends etc. She would get on me for not having friends, which I agreed. I was always a loner, and that's really something I'm trying to work on now. Sometimes i wouldn't hear from her for days, which had reasons from her dealing with personal issues, her health, or that she didn't really care to talk to me because she knew it'd just be small talk. She grew resentful, holding onto all the bad times and reminding me about them every time we had an argument. I didnt realize until later on in our relationship that she was never apologizing for her flaws, and instead deflecting blame onto me. Almost all the time. \n\nThe cycle continued. I loved her and she loved me, that was enough, right? That would sustain us, right? We weren't abusive and we apologized so it was okay, right? Everyone argues. It was only when we started couples therapy last year and after a few sessions that are therapist said \"I don't know if I can offer you guys the resolution you want because it seems like you need to work on yourselves before you work on your relationship\". And that hit me hard. I agreed that we take a break from couples therapy and continue our individual therapy. I started doing what my therapist recommended. Making more time for her, calling her more, doing little things to make her happy. It worked for a bit, but as soon as I slipped up even once - that would be what she remembered. That would be what she held onto. Not all the good stuff I did. Always the bad. I was her first ever relationship, and she kept bringing up others relationships, how they looked happier than us, how her bf did so and so and i didnt. But like, you only see what they want you to see, but she never believed that. \n\nFinally, I suggested we take some time apart to decide if this is what we both still want. Just a month. This was on christmas last year. I took the time to get better physically, start making more friends, and only grew fonder of her. I decided I did really want to be with her, and even started looking at rings, hoping she would come to the same conclusion. One month to the date, I asked her if we could talk. She said no, she needed more time to work on herself. Okay, fine, I respected that. Then we hit february. Our 5 year anniversary had passed, and I bought her presents, waiting to be able to talk again to give them to her. Then valentines day hit and I sent her flowers, wanting her to know I was thinking of her. She thanked me for them. Then we hit end of feb, and again when I reached out she said she needed more time. Then we hit march, saying I really wanted to know when we'd talk again. She said after her birthday. What? That's May. when I asked her why and I dont think thats really okay, she gets really defensive and tells me too bad, I asked for this break, so now I'm getting one. What can I do right? \n\nI start wondering if shes done at this point.. then the next day, a friend that lives in a different city hits me up asking if we're still together. I ask him why? He sends me a screenshot of her profile he saw on a dating site for muslim people. I didnt believe it so I made an account myself and sure enough.. there she was. Looking for \"the one\" according to her bio. That's what really cut deep. Like really really deep. Then I wondered if she was on the other popular muslim dating site and sure enough, she was the first profile that popped up.. I was really heartbroken. Every person I talked to about this said \"she is done, now you need to be done too\". I told her we had to talk and that I saw those accounts. I told her we shouldnt be together anymore.\n\nWe met up in person and she defended her decision, saying she just wanted to see what was out there but still wanted to come back. She said she never met up with any of the guys and was just taking the time to work on herself because she'd been going through a lot of health issues.  I believed the last part. But that wasn't okay. What was her plan, to come back in May and tell me she met someone else? And only if she didn't would we continue our relationship? She said it shouldn't matter because to her, we were not together in those months. To her, we were basically broken up. But we never said that. Did i believe that she didn't meet those guys? This girl that was my whole world, the love of my life.. i was so heartbroken. I still am.. I told her part of her had moved on, and that perhaps I need to too and we shouldn't be together. She kept saying she would be here if I changed her mind, but I told her not to hold onto that. We wished each other well and left. \n\nOn my way home, she calls me. I don't answer. Then I get a long message full of apologies, about how she planned to come back and try to talk to me more. How she knew her anger was an issue. How she knew she was the one really wrong, and not me. How badly she wanted to be with me, basically. Most of these things I never said to her, so I was surprised that she realized them on her own. Maybe we can work it out? I told her I need some time to think it over. She mentioned she had deleted those apps and knew what she did was wrong too. \n\nBut every single person i talk to - my sister, my parents, my friends - say its over. That the fact she even looked was unforgivable. We never said we'd see other people - we were going to work on ourselves. We were still together. I never even thought about doing that to her. I sleep on it. I come up with the same conclusion every time - its done. And I tell her. I offer to meet her again and discuss if she wants, and we agree for this past saturday. Then Saturday, it turns into Sunday because she was busy. When I ask what time that evening, she says we can meet after a week because she has an exam on friday and doesnt want this to make her sad and not study. What? I have obligations too.. I'm in school, but waiting a week to break up? I make it clear to her that that is what would happen when we meet, and that there is no point prolonging it. And then.. she gets defensive.. again. She starts bringing up how she was understanding when i was taking exams and I should be too. How this is the least I could do for her after all the bad things I did. Thats the last straw for me, and I tell her its Sunday or not at all. She likes the text. I tell her to let me know if she changes her mind. Then my friend reaches out to me again to tell me she's still on the apps, different pictures. Did she actually delete her profile? So sunday came and went and I never heard from her. I send her a  long message at 9pm, wishing her good luck and all the good memories I'll have of us. She never replies. And she's always free on weekends.\n\n So thats how it ended. My friends suggested I just block her number and I have. it hurts that she couldn't even say goodbye properly, but I know I did the right thing. I just wish I didn't hold on for as long as I did out of love. She was my longest relationship and she did help me grow a lot, and I hope I did for her as well, despite what she thinks about us. Based on the apps, she'll move on in her own way I guess. It hurts, but not as bad as I thought it would. I've decided to take the time to work on myself instead of jumping into something new for a few months. If you made it this far, thank you for your time, it means so much to me.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678727782.0},{"title":"Can someone tell me how to stop feeling so awful about myself?","author":"soultieddd","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/BreakUps\/comments\/11qfcs6\/can_someone_tell_me_how_to_stop_feeling_so_awful\/","text":"Straight after the breakup, my ex went and slept with a few girls, one being a girl I knew well.

Maybe you can try it? For this technique, you'll need to have had at least two breakups: one recent, one older. \n\nBackground: around 2018, I had a breakup from a 2-year relationship\/situationship that was very off-and-on, turbulent, etc. I was absolutely crazy about this guy, and after we broke up, I was a big mess. I didn't even try dating for another five years. I just healed very, very slowly, by avoiding any reminder or mention of him. Blocked him on everything. Literally didn't even speak his name. And it wasn't easy, because he was semi-famous and I kept seeing him everywhere, like on the side of buses and popping up on my TV. But eventually, I moved past it.\n\nMy most recent relationship only lasted a few months, but in some ways, it's been even more painful than my last breakup. Because while my previous relationship had a lot of problems, this one ended abruptly, while it was still (to me) \"perfect.\" This guy initially seemed a lot more available than my ex. He talked big about the future; wheeled me all around town to his friends and family and introduced me as \"my other half.\" The people who'd seen me single for half a decade said they were so happy for me, and how I deserved to finally be happy. I really believed it was going somewhere. Until he dropped me out of the blue. \n\nFor the first few days, I couldn't stop crying and screaming into my pillow. Couldn't eat without throwing up. Had to get sleeping pills from the doctor just to catch a few hours of rest. Nothing has been able to distract me from thinking about it, about him, constantly.\n\nExcept... for the first time, almost out of desperation, I've let myself start thinking about my previous ex; the one from 2018. For the first time, I looked him up on Instagram to see what he's doing these days (yep, still gorgeous and famous). I wrote down some of the memories we shared together - magical things we did and places we went, and moments when I felt so unbearably in love with him that I thought my heart might break.\n\nFor five years, I hadn't dared to look at those memories. I hadn't dared to think about him at all. Now, with the passing of time and the weight of a newer, fresher heartache, those memories don't really hurt anymore. Bittersweet, maybe, but not painful. I can regret how things turned out, while having clarity on why it never would have worked.  I can remember how I felt in those days without really feeling it anymore. \n\nAnd somehow... the process of handling those old relationship memories, combined with the general sense them being past\/healed, has been taking some of the pain from my more recent breakup. It's like I'm tricking my brain. It's desperate to ruminate on what I've lost, and so I'm giving it a different relationship to think about instead - one that doesn't hurt anymore. I'm poking the scars instead of the wound. It's feels like I'm reprogramming my brain pathways. Relationship memory + feeling okay = pain reducing.\n\nI don't think this will work if you're still in love with your older ex. You need to have moved past it. And it definitely won't work if it drives you back into that previous ex's arms. But I've taken a lot of comfort from the fact that my old relationship, which was once the most precious thing in the world to me, is now just another memory, without any particular love or hate attached to it. It feels neutral now. I know my most recent relationship will eventually feel the same. I'll be able to remember the things we did together, the memories we shared, without feeling like I'm breaking apart. If I can heal once, I can heal again. The proof is right there.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678682135.0},{"title":"Ex is not into sex but had sex after the break up","author":"Square_Repair3784","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/BreakUps\/comments\/11q9h8l\/ex_is_not_into_sex_but_had_sex_after_the_break_up\/","text":"I'm only helping a friend about his confusion after his break with his ex.

That was early February and I haven't talked to her since mid February. I apologized to her for my shortcomings and not understanding what she was trying to tell me and she forgave me but said we need to just move on and that she already felt fine a week later. I went into no contact and  I haven't heard from her till last Friday March 10th when she said she was sorry for my loss that my uncle had passed away, and yesterday for my birthday. She said happy birthday to me on the 12th and said she was happy that I was happy and had fun yesterday at my party with my guy friends and it looked like a lot of fun.\n\n So two times in a week after nothing at all.

When she left she said it was going to be very hard but then realized its not good bye we are just changing our title to a friend. She has abandonment issues and I don't believe she wants to cut completely. I feel like her mental health issues made her feel like I didn't love her or wasn't interested and I unfortunately did not reassure her the ways she wanted too in hindsight which is very painful for me she said she wanted to stay friends but I'm not so sure I want too. I have a very deep emotional connection. We where planing on getting married and moving in with eachother at my place after she was done with college.\n\nShe was talking to me yesterday and was saying that is was very hard to deal with and her best friend is the only reason she is still functioning as a person. She also told me she still has all the little gifts and things because they mean a lot to her and it's not to be thrown away or discarded because me, and the memories are cherished and not trash and that time together was important to her. I had mentioned getting my things back and said she could mail them but she said she didn't know if she could and said how about me meet up instead there was some things she wanted back as well. When I asked her about getting them back she said that she figured I would want it back, and she understands.\n\n I just want to know basically why she is still hanging around, watching my snap stories, sending me streaks, liking posts and being friends with my family on social media. I just need some advice as to why she's still here. I also found out she joined tinder a week after the breakup from a mutual friend, why she told him she was going on tinder is beyond me. He's more my friend then hers and she has to have known I was going to hear about it, I don't know if since she felt undervalued if she wanted to have some sort of instant gratification or what despite her saying she isn't interested in dating anyone when I had asked her the day of the breakup if there was someone else.

He was her older brother. He transferred to the university I was at, so we took some classes together. After turning him down for a date and then having him turn me down for a date, we finally started seeing each other after 6 months or so. It was fantastic. Our first date was to see a comet, we had mutual interests, he liked my family , I liked his. He was an alcoholic, and although he was sober the whole time we were together, it led to some fickleness and he was prone to sudden , selfish mood changes. After we graduated he was in a depressive state and broke it off with me for two days, came back and apologized and we decided to give it another try. 6 months later, he got a job and asked me to move with him to another state where his friends lived. I had always wanted to leave my home state, and I thought he was my future, so I went. \n\nHe loved his new job, I tolerated mine. We talked about moving back near our families. I wanted to more than him.  But he always told me we would go back someday when I missed my family. It was stressful for me because he was inconsistent about his priorities. We got two cats together. When I had bad days he would say we could drop everything to go back if we really needed too. Other days he told me he didn\u2019t want to go back. He went to meetings 4 nights a week. Which left me alone. I tried so hard. I started going to yoga and the gym and making myself busy when he was gone. I started being way bettter about making friends. \n\nOn our last good day together we took a trip to the snow. Everything was fine. We came back and he freaked out on me. Told me he didn\u2019t want to break up but he was having doubts about the future and had been having them for sometime now but never told me because he didn\u2019t wanna be wrong and push me away. He talked about being a man and not going back to safety of family. And how since I was a woman that made more sense for me. Blazing a trail for his future and things that I felt aren\u2019t him.

I truly fell in love at first sight, and she felt the same. You know when you look someone in the eyes and you can feel how they are feeling? it was like that. we were inseparable and honest to god it was the best relationship I had ever had.... well a week ago I found out her \"past\" wasn't actually a past. she had a BF of 3 years that she was hiding. and right at the end was lying to me about major things and that's how I found it all out.... but it just doesn't sit right with me. the way we were together just never felt fake, it never felt like she was hiding something until that very last week. She went out her way to meet my family, had plans to move closer to me in the future (our future plans just ironically lined up that way it wasn't planned at all). we'd talk about how both of us felt like this was weirdly different then anything before. and again it was only a month of dating... but I can't stop thinking of what it could of been. I don't feel like I can ever feel that way again for someone, and why she was doing what she did. why go on a date with me, why become my gf, why meet my family if you are with a long term boyfriend? and I just don't know what to do now.

I find that difficult because of how the relationship ended, how we were best friends, and how I felt blindsided by the breakup (he broke up with me the day after our one-year anniversary).

Everything Seems Bleak","author":"Catpaw08","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/BreakUps\/comments\/11q97ij\/what_next_everything_seems_bleak\/","text":"Hello People of Reddit. I broke up with my girlfriend. Posting here because I don't really have anyone else to empty my mind to.\n\n1 year ago a girl I liked proposed to me. I started developing feelings for her way before she proposed and when I used to ask her out she used to reject me because she felt that she was not ready. Because of her constant rejection I ended my friendship with her and focused on myself. 2 Years later i.e. in 2022 she proposed to me and I said yes. We dated for a week, I was already in love with her so I asked her to get committed. She agreed and so did I.  A month after we got into a relationship, she asked me if I could move in with her and her younger brother. I agreed as I loved her and it was helping her that the rent was splitting between us. For the first 4 months everything was going great. This was my first relationship. We both stumbled and picked each other right up. Things were going great. \n\nSome time later, we started fighting with each other, at first it was small fights where either one of us apologizes and they would get resolved, but as time passed our fights grew bigger and went on for longer and happened very frequently. Again either one of us would apologize and resolve it.\n\nI was putting my 100% in the relationship. Whenever an argument used to start it was mostly small reasons. I apologized when it was my fault and then I found myself apologizing for the things that weren't my fault. This started to happen a lot. My girlfriend found a job and I had to move back to my parents house for a few months. I had not told my parents of the relationship i was having because then they would not allow me to visit her again. I live in a very small home and hence i do not have any privacy to talk over the phone or a video call. I used to call my girlfriend whenever i had even a minute of privacy in my house. She was working a night shift at the time, we used to miss each other a lot and since most of our conversations used to happen on text it killed us both inside that we cannot talk to each other more.  During this time the arguments continued. When it was her fault she used to tell me that it was because of her periods, work stress, financial stress, etc. So I understood her and apologized. But every time something happened she used the same excuses again and again. I apologized nonetheless. The more I said sorry for the things I did not do the more I started to feel sorry for myself. One day I did not apologize and then she started to bring past arguments in the conversations which were resolved. This continued.\n\nI went to her place again for a couple of weeks. It was her birthday, I decorated her room and ordered a cake for her. I know this is the bare minimum, but this was the best I could offer. Even going to her place was the best I could offer. The fights continued to the point where she threatened me with her own life twice and eventually I lost it. Things went so far that I felt disgusted to even look at her. I had to break up with her because I felt like I was losing my self esteem with each argument. We both ended up having hate towards each other. \n\nI think we both felt the same things about the relationship. We both felt disrespected, underappreciated and misunderstood. We both accused each other of not putting enough effort. \n\nRight now I feel really alone. I wanted it to work with HER. I tried my best, I am not perfect but I tried and I did not feel the need to apologize for how I tried.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1678712818.0},{"title":"One of the Wildest Weeks","author":"SaiyanC124","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/BreakUps\/comments\/11q97dk\/one_of_the_wildest_weeks\/","text":"First some context.

Pretty early in talking we thought about being official but my anxiety and depression prevented that. A while later she gets into a relationship with someone, who goes to jail for \u201cno no content of minors.\u201d So, this January after it\u2019d been a while since we talked and I knew she had a boyfriend (not that he\u2019d been locked up for months), I decided to disappear as to not let my feelings get in the way. But February she finds me on Facebook, and because I liked her I accept and we talk again.\n\n10 days ago after she\u2019d broken up with the pedo, we decided to officially start dating now that my mental has improved. Everything was going well (I thought), we\u2019d talk for hours, play video games, seemed genuine. But one week into the relationship (and hour into our date) she admits to still loving the pedo and dumps me. I play it cool, pay for an Uber (stay on the phone to comfort her), call it a night. So not only was that alone pretty messed up, but yesterday she sends a text. Saying she has to cut me off completely because she got back with her jailed pedo ex (who is a genuine ass, ya know besides being a pedo) and he doesn\u2019t like me. Kinda wish I hadn\u2019t given her that $700 phone (and some other shit).\n\nSo, needless to say, pretty shitty weekend. Pretty intense week in general. I think I\u2019m done with girls for a pretty long while, that was a lot for 10 days. And with my mental health, we can\u2019t risk something like this happening again.

But now that it has been a week I'm struggling **a lot**. I've been crying every single day, including having a complete break down last night.

It just makes me miss her even more thinking about being with someone else. Because what if they don't do what she does? What if they don't have such a sweet laugh or is as fun to be around? So much confusion in my brain. I'll remain strong and not contact her but I'm here to admit it is absolutely tearing me up inside. \n\nI now feel like there's less meaning to life, she was my focus for years now.

We soon realized that we shared a lot of similar values and ways to look at life. For me it was magical.

Of course I deleted the videos, I did after waiting for her promised messages. So I asked her why was writing so rudely, because we split up loving each other and with the best wishes for each other. She told me that she moved on and doesnt care anymore, she said she didnt write to me because she didnt want the feelings she had to resurface again. I dont fucking care, she didnt come through for me. She let me down. 2 days later my birthday comes, no message. Another week goes by and yesterday I see her on her instagram with another man. When I saw that picture I threw up. I couldnt breathe. I gave her a ring with our names engraved in it, she doesnt wear it, I wasted all this money to come see her, she doesnt care, every night since January I dream of her, and she just doesnt care and is f*cking someone else. \nWe promised to love each other forever and marry each other. Both things will not happen. \nI feel so let down and disappointed..I never expected her to stay single forever but the combination of her telling me she doesnt care anymore and then seeing her with this guy\u2026 \n\nCan someone tell me how to overcome this? We were perfect for each other and now we will never see each other again\nI just wish she was sometimes still thinking about me fondly and remembering the great times we had together. But I dont think she is. \n\nWhile I was in clubs the last few weeks I made out with a couple of girls, becaus eI thought it will help me forget her but I just physically cant go ahead and sleep with them. I dont know how she does it. To me all of this is so unbelievable.\nWe were a match made in heaven. How could she move on so fast and forget about me.\n\nSorry for making this so long, I am sure there are people in this world that have way worse problems but yeah, I am suffering and I just needed to vent\n\nHave a good day","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678697095.0},{"title":"Processing breakup - Ex\u2019s attachment style a mystery - any guesses?","author":"TheBackSpin","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/BreakUps\/comments\/11q88k1\/processing_breakup_exs_attachment_style_a_mystery\/","text":"Some background: I'm a separated 41 year old male going through a divorce, just starting the mediation process. I was dating a 34 year old divorced woman for about 3 months and things were going well with the exceptions of some red flags. Most notably, her freaking out that I was going to go back to my ex-wife almost out of the blue. I reassured her she had nothing to worry about there and everything seemed ok, or so I thought. Fast forward to last week. I had to cancel a date because my ex came down with pneumonia (not diagnosed at the time but she was extremely sick) so I had to watch the kids. She did not take this well, in spite of canceling and rescheduling some dates herself, and told me sick people watch their children all the time, she didn't want to be in some love triangle, and broke things off. She elaborated she does not want to deal with anxiety of me going back to my ex and until I was divorced it's just not worth it for her but she'd like to keep talking to me as friends. I reassured her my ex and I have a co-parenting relationship but that's the extent of it; of course I'd respect her decision and emphasize with not wanting to live in a state of anxiety. Some other info which may be helpful, she has mentioned in the past a history of dating emotionally unavailable men. Things were definitely intensifying between us directly before all this. As for myself, I have tested as Secure Attachment style although I was somewhat close to the Avoidant side.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678710241.0},{"title":"How to know if it\u2019s really over\u2026","author":"NotItGirlX","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/BreakUps\/comments\/11q88gd\/how_to_know_if_its_really_over\/","text":"I now understand the way to know it it\u2019s really over between 2 people.

I (21 F) started dating this guy (21 M) off of tinder. I wasn\u2019t really interested in dating at the time but when we first starting hanging out, we just clicked. He was so amazing to hang out with. This was my first serious relationship so I was pretty new to all this stuff. He was funny and weird and was so handsome. At the beginning of our relationship we had our downs. I\u2019ve always learned (from toxic men in my life) that it\u2019s not okay to be clingy, or super affectionate. So I wasn\u2019t. And I wasn\u2019t super sexual to him cuz I was always ashamed of my body. Growing up I was always bullied for being over weight. He called me beautiful and said he loved my body, but the negative impact from growing up always seemed to stick in my head way more than the positive. So it took time for me to be super sexually active towards him. That was one of our arguments. He wanted me to be more affectionate and sexual for him and thought those were small things for me to change. So I did. At least I thought I did. He to this day thinks I never changed. But who I was a year ago definitely isn\u2019t me now. I really thought I was trying. But at the same time he wasn\u2019t trying either and I\u2019ve always had a feeling in the back of my mind that he wasnt. I was so in love with him. So I wanted to change everything for him. We moved in together and it progressively got worse. There wasn\u2019t much to do in our apartment except play video games and watch tv, we didn\u2019t even have board games or card games. We were too different people. He liked to smoke weed all the time and I liked to drink with friends and have a good time (which that was something I stopped cuz he didn\u2019t like alcohol). We got into plenty of fights. Well more like he would completely distance himself and ignore me and not talk to me until I got so anxious that I blow up on him to tell me what\u2019s going on. For starters we got into arguments about how we never really hang out with each other, and I tried telling him that I don\u2019t like being stuck in the bedroom cuz I like open spaces, and he said that we lived like roommates, which was probably true, I\u2019m a home body and I\u2019m comfortable in my own living space, but at the same time he never tried to hang out with me, even tho I would go into our room where he played his games and watch him or bring all my stuff (like my little table and computer) into the room so we could be in the same room playing games. See I was the only one with a car but I\u2019d take him anywhere he wanted to go. He wouldn\u2019t ever ask me out on a date. And he knew I didn\u2019t make a lot of money so there wasn\u2019t much places we could go. But he wouldn\u2019t ever come out and spend time with me in the living room. I always had to go to him. All I wanted out of the relationship was someone who wanted to give me attention but all it seemed was that I was to only give him attention with none in return. But man did he like to gaslight me into thinking there was always something wrong with me in the relationship but wouldn\u2019t really see it my way. He would drop it and say he was sorry but I had a feeling he just dropped it and we didn\u2019t really resolve it. We recently had a really big fight and he said some really hurtful things to me. Even telling me that he didn\u2019t like how it\u2019s easy to cheat on me. But I asked him if he has and he said he never did he just doesn\u2019t like the fact that it can be. Which didn\u2019t make any sense cuz it\u2019s easy to cheat on anybody. That should have been the day I left him. And I might add, all throughout the relationship he constantly asked me if I was cheating on him which yes is already another red flag. But I wasn\u2019t ready to let him go cuz I was so in love with him. One day he left his phone in the bathroom and I looked to see if he was cheating on me. I looked at Snapchat I should have done more digging but I saw a girl sent him a picture and I only opened up the picture and it wasn\u2019t anything flirtatious but I was mad at the fact that he has a streak with her when he stopped doing streaks with me cuz he just didn\u2019t want to anymore. He confronted me about it cuz he saw he had an open message that he didn\u2019t click on and I asked who she was and he said she was just a friend and asked if I wanted him to block her, I didn\u2019t want to force him to do anything, I just wanted him to want to block her. We had one more talk and we both agreed if we could both put in 100% and we both really try it\u2019ll work out. I told him I just want him to communicate with me and I didn\u2019t like that he smoked so much. He smoked until he got super high every single day which I didn\u2019t really like. I only have seen him sober 1 day the entire time we\u2019ve been together. And that was the day I forced him to cuz I wanted to see what he was like when he was sober.

I am also practicing trying to be a more honest person and opening up about my experiences (and the risks of judgment and hate) are part of that process. I want to live my life with more integrity as an honest person. \n\nI broke up with my ex-partner of 9 years last year in April, I was at her 21st birthday and she was struggling to work out whether to invite me to her 30th (after we split up). We spent our whole adult lives together and I am still struggling to move on. The reason I provided when breaking up with her was that I told her that I felt I was no longer attracted to her, we stopped having sex regularly a couple of years ago (about 7 years in). This reason was actually untrue, but me explaining the loss of attraction slowly eroded and destroyed our relationship.  \n\nDuring the end of our relationship we agreed to go to couples therapy, however the couples therapist concluded that it was an issue residing in me. I spent some time doing my own therapy while we were still together and I realised the source of my anxiety about the relationship and the breakdown of our intimacy was the fact that I had cheated on her with a sex worker (several years prior). Initially, I didn't think this was the reason for the complete break down of our intimacy (my cheating behaviour),  but in hindsight I have realised it certainly was. In fact, there was nothing wrong with my partner at all, she was beautiful, relentlessly supportive of me, made me laugh and we had a great companionship together. Looking back she honestly deserved better during the last few years of our relationship. I feel very ashamed that I blamed the change in my feelings on her, when really it was my failure to be an honest authentic person with her (which impacted our sex life). \n\nFor about a year now I have realised that she was an amazing partner, and perhaps one I didn't deserve to be with and may never come across again. We grew up together. I have spoken to my therapist about writing a letter and asking to speak to her to tell her the truth about what happened. Part of me stupidly thinks this would help her understand the intimacy issues because it wasn't actually about her, and it gives me hope we could reconcile or work through it (given I do still love her, and I ended things due to this secret because I was too much of a coward to tell her). However, the other part of me just wants her to know the truth, and to help her understand why  I could never give her a straight reason about the break up (which she did not want at the time) and why I kept flipping on my feelings (I want to get back together\/ or it isn't right). \n\nI know that what I have done is wrong, and believe me the amount of regret and shame I have about this is immense. I have trouble moving on because she never did anything to hurt me, she was always supportive and I hurt her immensely when things ended, and then again when she was open to getting back together (mid break up) and I hadn't processed the grief\/reality of the situation and told her again I didn't want to be together (I regret this decision\/statement more than anything....). After this she cut me out and made decisions to protect her feelings and her self. I know my behaviour was incredibly selfish. \n\nDown the track she has told me she is open to being friends in the future, but she has just entered into a new relationship and I have let her be and taken space. I guess I want to know: \n\n1. Should I tell her about the cheating behaviour to help her make sense of what happened \n2. How do I let go of such a wonderful person, and move on, accept my mistakes? I hate myself for what I have done, and I constantly am haunted by her giving me a second chance in the break up and me throwing that away. It was never about her and I truly believe she was a soul mate for me and I will never find anyone better.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678689932.0},{"title":"Says she has too much going on and she can\u2019t do a relationship right now","author":"InstructionChoice875","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/BreakUps\/comments\/11q5x0p\/says_she_has_too_much_going_on_and_she_cant_do_a\/","text":"Even said that she wanted to be with me but felt like she caused too much confusion.

We both are in relationships now, and yes, I\u2019m extremely happy in my relationship. But I do think of my ex often, not because I miss dating him\u2026 but he was a person I really cared about! We spent so much time together! I don\u2019t understand, why is it considered normal for someone to become dead to you once they end the romance? Doesn\u2019t the connection mean more than that? How can I ever feel safe being so vulnerable with someone if they can become a stranger the next day?

It started December 14th. I had a suside attempt and even my fianc\u00e9 wasn't really able to talk me down. Eventually I was able to get talked down, and apparently a few hours passed, and she was talking to her parents. And she said all the rules we broke, that we were intimate before, that we were always talking when we were supposed to, that we sent pictures to each other, that we broke pretty much all the rules they gave us. And at 4:50AM (to sleep on a call together so I wasn't able to sleep without her) and she broke up with me. And I told my mom immediately, I was able to be with her for a little bit and about at 6:00 a.m. or a little earlier I went to the bridge near me and tried jumping off. I was on there for like 4 or 5 hours, I made it on the news even. Apparently she was upset with me and things were going downhill for her for a while. I was perfectly happy but apparently she wasn't. I have a lot of problems, I was in a dysfunctional family all by myself. And my father is a cheater, a drug addict, and alcoholic, and narcissist, and so much more so I didn't know how to treat a woman. But I was trying my best. We were together for nearly 3 years!! And later that day I absolutely freaked out, trying to kill myself again but my mom stopped me. And my lower intestinal tract was horrible with pain. Apparently it was a lot ulcers and I had a bad blood infection. I stayed in the hospital for almost a full day and was able to go back home. A few days later I had to talk to my congregation (it's very wrong and against the rules to the intimate before marriage) so I got in a lot of trouble, more than she did because she admitted it. Instant she is 17 and I'm 19 apparently it wasn't quite legal. (WHICH MAKES NO SENSE SHE'S LESS THAN HALF A YEAR FROM 18) luckily enough I wasn't in trouble legally. And we were talking for a few weeks trying to figure all of it out, because apparently she still wanted to be with me. So we were talking and seeing if it would work out. And I think it was like the 7th or something she said that it's not going to work out basically. And then on the 8th I think, she texted me saying she doesn't want me to text her first we shouldn't really be talking and that she will only message me.\n\nEverything in life has gone downhill, our conversations are awful! We barely talk whatsoever and when we do it makes me want to end it all because I can't have her! I don't know what to do anymore I'm in so much pain! I feel so bad and I just don't know how I can keep going. WE HAD EVERYTHING TOGETHER!!!\n\nI don't really have anyone to talk to and I'm sorry to bring all this to you. I'm just so lost and I'm in so much pain.\n\nAnd just today after she said she would never tell anyone, and that she doesn't want me to tell anyone at all that we were talking a little bit privately she told her mother and the elders. Now my mom probably lost her friendship with someone, and is probably going to get in trouble for hiding it.\n\nI called The suicide hotline just a few minutes ago and they suggested a support group so I'm hoping you guys can help me. I can't do my therapist anymore because I've lost my insurance card and they need to verify it or something. Just today I've tried and checking myself in the veins with air but I'm too scared of needles, and that was probably a few hours of trying, I've tried jumping off the roof at least four or five times, I tried suffocating myself with a bag but I panicked and took it off a dozen times at least and I'm not overestimating. I've tried to slit my wrists but the knife was too freaking dull, I tried to stab myself in the heart but I couldn't do it! Honestly the longest time today without trying to kill myself was probably 30 or 40 minutes. I actually try to OD just before I called the suicide hotline. I truly need help please somebody help me I'm all alone.\n\nPlease I need a friend, I need someone, I need I don't know what I need! I need someone to freaking help me now!!!

A tl;dr may be at the end, why not check and see? You may be surprised(there isn't one).\n\nI(29m) lost the love of my life(25f) of 3 and 1\/2 years almost a month ago now. It was one of the hardest things I have EVER had to experience. I am so much better for it, as is she. This fact haunts me and gives me hope all at once.\n\nI won't spoil this with my backstory but I'll begin when I flew out from my home state of Tennessee to Seattle, Washington with nothing but a suitcase and a precious few dollars to my name. The one thing I brought more of than anything was depression. I was rife with it, but determined to work my butt off and do whatever it might take to make something of myself. After whatever jobs combing dirt and laboring menially I could find, I started working a security job that I took just because it was the quickest money I could find. I never weighed all that much but I did carry myself in a serious manner, which aided my illustrious and short-lived career as a professional mannequin. Seriously, I was mistaken for one on at least three separate occasions. It was easy to blend, stoic and unamused, in the background - to go unnoticed. There's plenty of stories there :).\n\nOne day, while standing guard at this fairly popular gift shop on 1st and Pine downtown, I spotted a woman, wearing a navy blue jacket with some airline logo on the front, stark straight dark brown strands obscuring half of it. Her eyes were my first observation, steady and calm, with a hurt tenderness that I could feel. I was interested by the person, and admittedly enthralled by her presence. Being a naturally introverted person, I would typically have been reserved and pensive. With her though, I found myself naturally go to her and just start talking. Long story short, she invited me out to the bar for a friendly drink. \n\nFast forward a few months, we have been out with one another learning about our lives and I have never been more excited to be alive in my whole life. I'm buzzing with an electricity that grows on a daily basis. Every day I spend with her makes me want to spend yet another dozen with her. I am for the first time in my life falling naturally in love. On one of the many countless Seattle summer nights we spent roaming downtown, me made our way to the piers. Back then there was a road called the viaduct that ran somewhat behind and above the piers along the coast downtown. They have torn it down since, but I'll always remember one part in particular. On this certain evening, we came to an overlook. We paused our talking to observe a man standing at the end with a guitar. He was obviously homeless, with a bottle of Jack in hand, only a swig left in the bottom. As he eyed the last remaining bit of booze, we approached him. In our good spirits, we kindly greeted him and began to talk to him. I asked him if he could play us a song, house choice. He smiled as I handed him a 20 from my wallet. He ended up playing CCR - Have You Ever Seen the Rain. We sang together like we were the only three people on the planet. Might as well have been, the way it felt :^).\nThat's when I knew I was for sure, head over heels, in love.\n\nI confessed my affection, and assured her I was more than anything her friend. Then the fateful night. We were saying our goodbyes after another wonderful evening , and I asked her if she would be my girlfriend. Yeah, I wasn't impressive at all, but I was true. That night, June 08, 2019, at pier 58 in Seattle, she said yes with the most amazing smile! Our relationship flourished. So much so I allowed myself to think almost only about nurturing it. We shared life, music, and life like I never knew possible. The beauty of those first months can never be tainted in my mind. Our special song still is too painful to listen to to this day. \n\nThen that bittersweet day came. We had unintentionally gotten pregnant. She went in to confirm and found that it was a boy. I was immediately ecstatic! I knew I had it in me to be the best father for that baby on the planet. I was ready to carry the world on my shoulders for this potential family. We shared this beauty with many smiles and songs and what ifs together. But our lives stalked us in the shadows. Circumstance clouded our judgement. I assured her I supported her in anything she chose, but that I'd make a pretty amazing father and she an equally impressive mom. She was rushed to decide due to being nearly 3 months along. It was a traumatic time, especially when she decided she wanted the abortion. I'll just say, I'll never completely heal from that day. The day it happened. Afterwards, nothing was the same. I cannot and do not want to blame her. I can only imagine she must blame herself though. I tried to talk, but my anxiety kept me from staying calm and coherent when the discussions got dicey, and she reflexively closed up even more. A horrible positive-feedback-loop.\n\nIn the end, we drifted. We fought more and more. We began to lose trust in one another. Ultimately, she spared me the pain of continuing to fail at meeting her needs, and vice versa. I ended it, but I know she knew it was already done. I tried to talk sensibly but I was overwhelmed by emotion and grief. After several days, with nowhere else around to go and fearing I could never keep myself from tormenting us both, I left back home to TN. \n\nThe years weren't kind, with each of us having our own struggles. We supported on another as much as we could over time. And over time, our strength and individuality began to fade. We were consumed by circumstance, especially my own personally legal difficulties. We still talk, but it isn't the same, and hasn't been for too long before even the breakup. \n\nAll of this is to say this: What I experienced being with her was the best part of my life, and losing her felt like the worst, but even better is yet to come. We have found a way to talk and continue to be friends, even though it's new to both of us. We have found, little at a time, forgiveness and understanding, and we are still figuring it out. But my hurt can not take away the beauty I saw in and through this woman. She's growing and changing and she's gonna rock the world. I get to say I knew her...\n\nIn the end, it was all so worth it, even now in my stage of grief. I have seen a true love like no other and I want to improve myself so I'm prepared to better express that love to my next partner without so much of the bs of life holding me back. I have hope, even in this dark out of depression. I hope you have hope, too. \n\nSorry no tl;dr. I can add one in the edit.\nPlease feel free to ask anything.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678686772.0},{"title":"Tired of this \"avoidant\" thing...","author":"Dreamy_FrozenYogurt","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/BreakUps\/comments\/11pn302\/tired_of_this_avoidant_thing\/","text":"When in fact, the person just doesn't want you.","upvote_ratio":0.83,"created_utc":1678648652.0},{"title":"A story with a moral - don't make the same mistake as I did.","author":"Bright_Journalist676","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/BreakUps\/comments\/11ppv23\/a_story_with_a_moral_dont_make_the_same_mistake\/","text":"And here I am again.

That's was the most terrible thing I'd gone through in my life. I literally went to hell and back. She was the love of my life. And she broke my heart into pieces. \nI moved out of our apartment, and went No contact. In the meantime, I somehow managed to slowly pull myself up and get my life together. I slowly started healing. It wasn't easy, but, with a lot of effort, I started believing that there's still a lot of living, and maybe even loving, to do for me.\n\nAbout 2 weeks ago, she broke NC, and reached out. She said she wanted to meet and talk. And I, idiot that I am, agreed. We talked all night. Turned out, the guy she left me for was a total asshole that didn't treat her right.\nThe following day, she broke up with him.\n\nWe remained in contact. She said she still wanted me in her life, but only as a friend. I said I still loved her, and it would be great if  we could give the relationship another shot. Not come back to what we'd had, but start over. See, I never stopped loving her, and even her leaving for someone else didn't kill that love I had for her. How could I be \"just friends\" with someone I deeply love? I loved her with all my heart and soul, despite all that she put me through. And I told her that. \nI was willing to forgive the betrayal and forget about the past. And start again. \nShe said she'll think about it. \n\nI was being a damn fool. A naive, goddamn fool. \n\nToday, she said she doesn't want to be with me again. \n\nI said that, in this case, this is goodbye. And that she should forget about me, and never contact me again. She accepted that. \n\nI'm totally destroyed. I don't know what to do. My life is over. She broke the heart that loved her - twice. She rejected my love - twice. I don't see any meaning in all this anymore. In fact, I seriously want to end my life. \"Life ain't worth living without the one you love\". There's a hook on the ceiling in my room, and some rope in the closet. The end is near. Just a couple more days, and I'll be gone. So this may be my last post here. \n\nSo, dear children, the moral of my story is: don't break NC, and if your ex does, don't react. Nicely and politely tell them to f*** off. Otherwise, you'll be hurting terribly, and I wouldn't wish that to happen to anyone. Once your ex is gone, stay as far away from them as possible. Block them if you have to. Delete their number. Cause you don't want to be suffering as bad as I am right now. Take my word for it. It's the worst feeling in the universe. \n\nThe end. \nRoll the credits.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678655187.0},{"title":"She just messaged me and now I don't know what to feel","author":"throwaway373929858","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/BreakUps\/comments\/11pkwry\/she_just_messaged_me_and_now_i_dont_know_what_to\/","text":"She just messaged me after ghosting me for a month.

I\u2019ve heavily questioned my views of myself and reality. \n\nFirst, some much needed context:\n\nWe never had ANY forms of abuse in our relationship from either side, neither before nor after. Our relationship was not happy, but there were never any instances of abuse, stalking, or threats thereof. There was one time during an argument that she had blocked me on everything to get back at me (basically the silent treatment on steroids). Feeling stressed and like I might not get the chance to make things right, I parked outside of her apartment building, threw a tennis ball at her window (she lived on the third floor) and asked if we could talk. Naturally, she had a pretty adverse reaction, so I calmly left. This was relatively early on in our relationship, but it seemed to never be something we really got over. Every time it was brought up in an argument, I apologized profusely and told her that I had no idea it would have made her feel so unsafe and that it would never happen again, which it didn\u2019t. \n\nNow, though our relationship was not abusive, as one can gather from the excerpt above, it was certainly toxic. She was EXTREMELY anxious-avoidant. Despite my best efforts, she refused to offer her feelings or thoughts until they reached a boiling point, usually during the middle of a \u201cbreakup\u201d. Though it was beyond frustrating for me, I tried to maintain a sympathetic stance to encourage her to feel safe to open up. Still, we just weren\u2019t able to bridge that communication gap. She also had pretty poor emotional intelligence and self-awareness. What resulted was a vicious, compounding cycle of repressed feelings, distancing, and distrust, during which no conflicts would ever truly resolve and would ultimately culminate in a breakup. I want to add here that I certainly played my part in our relationship dynamic (if you want to know, just ask). In fact, I internalized quite a bit of it to the point that I felt solely responsible for our relationship a lot of the time.\n\nEventually, this cycle brought us both to a sort of breaking point, resulting in a permanent breakup that, at the time, she was not able to explain. Seeing that I wasn\u2019t going to get any answers while she was still experiencing that level of stress, we initiated no contact. A couple months later, while I was in town for work, I arrange to come pick up the last of my things from her porch. Afterwards, I attempt to initiate some friendly contact, to which she has a visceral reaction. She is terrified of me, and I have no idea why. In trying to figure out why, the conversation erupts into an argument and results in me being blocked on every possible platform.\n\nSome further context, I had an abusive stepdad for a few years in elementary school. I have spent my entire life working to ensure I don\u2019t resemble him in any form. This visceral response was naturally confusing and eventually hurtful, especially when she refused to explain and then blocked me. I was left with this huge weight that I didn\u2019t know what to do with.\n\nThe next couple months were rough, but I stuck to NC to give things time to cool off. About a month and a half later, I email her asking if we can talk. Given, at this point I was kind of desperate for answers, having seriously internalized the way she treated me. After more or less begging her for closure, she gives me a couple of vague reasons and swears up and down that we will never speak again because she already has closure and that she\u2019s moving across the country and transferring schools (which she didn\u2019t); another visceral reaction. This encounter didn\u2019t solve anything, so back into NC we went.\n\nAnother month and a half later, I try to initiate conversation because I was having a pretty difficult time finding closure for myself (it happens). Over several emails spanning a couple of weeks or so, I explain to her my reasons for contacting her and the conversation I\u2019d like to have, even ending it with giving her the option of whether or not we talked, just to let me know so I would stop wasting my time. Here I will add that her silence in our relationship was a given, and that there was little way for me to  interpret it. Much of our discussions during our relationship had shared a similar \u201ccat and mouse\u201d dynamic. The day after I sent my last email, I get a call from her local police department giving me her request that I stop trying to contact her. I was in utter shock. My heart sank, and I was left with more questions than ever before. Was this really where we were? Did she really see me as this monster stalker that she needed the police to protect her from? Was I becoming my first stepdad without even realizing? She had made me question my reality before, but this was an entirely new level.\n\nAdmittedly, this next part is pretty regrettable. Feeling perhaps more hurt and lost than ever before, a couple weeks later (this past Friday) I decide to call her bluff. I email her the only website that had helped me during our breakup (it was a guide to avoidant personality types) and told her that it was the only thing that helped me. I had a sort of panic attack and called her a coward and told her to \u201cjust say something.\u201d Predictably, I get a call from the police department again the next day (yesterday).\n\nThis sent me into a spiral. I felt like I was in this inescapable hell where she had emotionally abused me, withheld the information that I had politely requested that would have allowed me to move on with my life easier, and yet had the legal precedent to request police intervention because she didn\u2019t want to talk. I felt angry that she was wasting taxpayer resources for what was, arguably, a pretty trivial situation. I felt lost. I felt hopeless. I felt that this pain would dictate my life and all of my future relationships. I felt trapped. I spent the day on hotlines just trying to make sense of it all, trying to repair my ego and all that I thought I knew to be true about myself. I wrestled with the cognitive dissonance of having made someone (that I cared about) feel that uncomfortable and unsafe to feel that police intervention was necessary and the anger of being stuffed into this box by her, intentionally or unintentionally worsening the cycle that had started several months prior. I talked to the police officer, and he even used the word \u201coverreaction\u201d. However, it didn\u2019t make it easier to swallow the pill that my ex had called the police for trying to talk to her. The biggest inner conflict for me in all of this has been the notion of my reality vs. hers and which one was real. That combined with my need to people please just made the idea that her friends and family probably all saw me as a psycho really do a number on me.\n\nToday, I\u2019m better. I\u2019ve had to just take today for what it is and have not spent a lot of time imagining the future implications of this fiasco. Still, I have felt this relief before, only to be swallowed back into the cycle sometimes mere hours later. I wanted to share this because a.) I thought it would make a funny story and b.) I wanted the chance to talk about it separate from the friends and family who would be disappointed in me. I don\u2019t know how I feel about her right now, but I hope that I\u2019m someday able to see the situation for what it is.\n\nEdit: typo","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678668368.0},{"title":"My dream turned into a nightmare","author":"throwaway937u3u","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/BreakUps\/comments\/11pv649\/my_dream_turned_into_a_nightmare\/","text":"When my ex cheated on me, she blocked me everywhere, and I never got closure or an explanation.

I had a break-up roughly 14 months ago...It made me a mess. Before this girl and the break up, I was a well collected man, I worked towards my goals every day...What I did in the past 14 months? Working towards my goals about two days per month, other days I'm just procastinating everything and laying on my bed.\n\nThe relationship started with a lot of love bombing by her. Not gonna lie, I felt that it's a special connection. Then it went into something that came with a lot of arguing, where I tried to solve problems always alone, while she just made up them. But I loved this girl, so I tried my best. The relationship ended with blindsiding me. In case you are wondering about details dear reader, check out my previous post, I think I wrote about it more there. Not a miracle that in 2-3 months she posted about someone else, not a miracle that after 14 months she has a completely different life, meanwhile I'm nearly at the same spot. She had a head start into grieving that we lost. I know it's not a race, also I shouldn't compare my progress to her's...But you know, the little devil is always on our shoulder.\n\nHow I know she has a completely different life...One thing I can manage perfectly. Since we told each other our last words, I never even had even the slighliest little urge to write her. I just won't. I fear of the second rejection, also it was her decision to end things. It was her task to reach out. She didn't. I won't say I'm okay with that, but I wouldn't say that I'm sad because of that either. But one thing I can't get over...Checking her social media. I know it's just destroying my progress, that's why I'm at the same spot. I know it works like an addiction and I'm in fact an addict right now. I know people post only the good things, no one posts a selfie while they cry. Even I saw that my ex is like that, we had big arguments a day, then on the same day she posted something such wholesome, I was like wtf? Of course I tried to give that meaning at that time, so I processed it as, our arguing was a small something, but I make this girl happy. It was the beginning of our end, four months later I found out.\n\nI see blocking not a good solution, I tried it, failed it, unblocked her then checked. I would like to destroy this habit from its core...When even if she would print her pictures and she would come here and push them into my face, I would just close my eyes and smile on something entirely else. I find it so scary that even if I block her, even if I delete my socials, I'm always just a few clicks away from getting info about her. Unblock someone, make a new profile is just a few seconds or minutes, it's always there. So I want to destroy this demon in myself from its core. I just don't know how. :(\n\nI had a few attempts, but always failed...My record was 28 days. This 28th day was pretty good, a Friday. I went to take a warm bath as I usually do at the end of the week. Then when I got off from the bath, my brain shut down completely, I had a weird feeling and I was on autopilot, went to check my ex's profile. It came so sudden. And I would like to destroy this. In the past few months it became a daily thing again, I have to confess. While she is active, nothing really triggered me. I'm already familiar that she has someone else or that she has a new job etc...If see things about those, I'm just feel myself bad a little bit. Not like 1 year ago.\n\nBut today she posted about something I never thought she would do and made me cry heavily. And also it's something that she will post about nearly every day in the future, so...Even if I will stop visiting her profile, I will know there is something new, I'm missing out. But maybe later it will better to know? Sometimes I checked it because \"I'm wondering if she posted something?!\"...Now I will be sure she posted something when next time I try to stop myself from checking her. I just have try to resist to the urge to check them. That will be a bit different I guess.\n\nI can't even remember how it feels to live absolutely freely, without this little devil on my shoulder. 14 months, plus 5 or 6 months before the break up, when she made feel myself absolutely terrible nearly every day...My last day, when I was not heartbroken or my ex girlfriend didn't made me feel bad was on July 13th 2021.\n\nDear world!

Last night, she wrote to me and asked if we could talk a bit. I tried to talk like normal, like nothing had happened. I tried to look better this time and never mentioned that I'm still in a dark place. She was telling me how things are not going well for her, and I felt a bit bad, but I didn't mention anything about getting back together. After a while, I stopped the conversation, and 30 minutes later, she wrote to me again and asked if we could meet. We met, and she mentioned that the last 2 days, she started to have panic attacks. I asked her what symptoms and what triggered them. The first trigger was when she heard her friends mentioning plans with their partners for vacation, and that was the trigger. But I'm not sure if I'm the trigger, or the trigger is that she's now not sure if she will have a boyfriend that she can go on vacation with. The second trigger was when she heard a song that we used to listen to together. The symptoms that she mentioned were difficulty breathing, but nothing else. I said to her that I think this is not a panic attack but an emotional crisis, and she should still be careful and look for a therapist. We stopped at a coffee shop and talked more. I still tried not to make her feel bad (while she made me feel really bad many times during the breakup process). She still mentioned that she's not doing okay, but I tried to encourage her and tell her that things will start to get better. I never mentioned that I'm doing badly. Instead, I tried to look good. Also, there was a moment where she called me by my pet name. In the end, she hugged me a few times and cried a bit. I still stopped myself from telling her, \"Hey, you can fix this,\" because if she wanted that, she could have told me, \"Hey, I made a mistake. Let's talk and work things out.\" Instead, I told her that I just hope she'll get better and take care of herself. I felt normal last night, but I'm back to not feeling normal today. I still don't understand her. She's either trying not to feel guilty or trying to be sure that she still has me as a backup. What do you think?

So after 48hrs (Saturday) I confronted him with a (I think, correct me if I'm wrong) honest + straightforward text: \"Is this a difference in communication style\/busy-ness thing, or are you just not interested anymore?\" I figured it would require an honest answer, and I was honestly concerned he was fading out so I didn't feel I was sending the text to be manipulative (he wasn't texting me as frequently, which I interpret as a sign of interest). I would have helped me move on and wrap things up conclusively if he gave me a definitive answer on his interest.\n\nIt's been over 24hrs and no response. And man, that sucks.

I saw her in the hallway and immediately wanted to pursue something with her, so I did we hit it off pretty well and had a wonderful few months together. Aside from her not understanding basic relationship functions and her lacking a serious ability to communicate due to her past, I still loved her and wanted to pursue something with her for potentially the rest of my life, I sure as hell was oblivious back then haha. \n\n\nSo fast forward 4 months in, we were pretty active, going out on dates, enjoying each others presence and all was completely well, atleast I thought. There were time's when we had fights with one another where's I tried to go a reasonable route that could benefit The both of us ya know? Like fighting against our issues as a couple not fighting each other. But she always found a Way to twist that into turning her into a victim about something that either originally about me, or how she acted. This became such a reoccurring theme that I eventually just stopped talking about the way I felt almost a year later. I knew I still loved her and I still wanted something with her so I just kept the relationship going.\n\n\nNow I wasn't perfect either, I definitely wasn't the most mature back then I was self centered, a liar and a people pleaser, but as our relationship went on I improved alot, I did everything I could to better myself while struggling to meet her image of perfection. I felt like I was walking on needles the entire time. And every time I slipped up, she'd cry, give me silent treatment, lash out or vent to her youngers friend slandering my name and making me look worse then I already felt. I always had to change, I always had to do better even when the situation was about the way she treated me. I started feeling like crap as the week's turned into months. With every waking day I worried about what issue she'd bring onto me next. With this year being my breaking point. She met a girl I'll call M (18F) that's when shit started going completely downhill.\n\n\nEverytime N argued with me she'd always go to M, and M would feed into her toxic or even down right insecure beliefs. N made it seem like I did nothing to communicate or even understand her when I devoted every fucking moment I could to better understand her to have conversations with her but it always turned into an argument, to the point i began getting insecure of M, so I tried addressing N that I felt highly uncomfortable with Ns behavior. she acknowledged and moved on. Fast forward to a week from today (March 12th). I was emotionally done with my relationship, i fell completely out of love with N and I wanted to leave, but I was scared about the lengths he'd go to slander me, i was scared that maybe I was the one who was the problem. And boy was my fear valid. \n\n\nWe broke up today, the first thing he's did was accuse me of leaving him for my girl best friend, and blocked me before I could even say a thing, I looked at her accounts she was talking about me love bombing her, me using her, me being an abusive asshole who never cared about her in the first place. And honestly I believe it, she tried texting me again, but I just blocked her, blocked her friend's and blocked everything about her. I can't even bring myself to open up My gallery or My socials, I know for certain my reputation is finished, maybe I should have just sucked it up and accepted the fact I'm just a failure as a boyfriend. Atleast that's how I feel anyways. My apologies for the long rant, I just needed to speak after such a long time of silence.

Together for 2 years, She basically wanted more independence and I wanted stability as I have kids (from previous).

There's an age gap and we're at different life stages. Sad but I can accept that.\n\nWe've been NC since the breakup aside from seeing her 2 days after when she came to get her stuff (tried to sneak in when she thought I'd be out), had 1 hour of her being cold, 1 hour of her being her normal self and we had a really good convo which gave me hope that we had some future (she has some grief stuff to figure out and process). Agreed friends - texting OK, meet up OK, no phone calls. I reached out after a week via text, and she ignored. I don't understand why she's totally vanished. I mean I do, a combo of guilt, self-protection and cowardice but she built a real relationship with my kids too, how do you walk away from that without even saying goodbye?\n\nShe's abandoned me, and the kids. I hate her for that. She detached herself, and then walked away on a bombshell and just got on with her life like I never happened. She didn't try to fix things with me, she didn't explore how we could change it up to meet what she wanted... she just.... left.. At the same time though, I do still love her. I don't want to, but we had such a good relationship and we share an intense connection.

She had broken my trust on more than one occasion by talking to exes behind my back, potentially cheated, got physically abusive early in the relationship when she was drunk, and I lost all my close friends because of this. Over years of this I grew colder, and as we got busier we began talking and seeing each other less and less until deciding to end it. We were getting older (late 20s) and it didn\u2019t seem like we were interested in going further in the relationship.\n\n\n Fast forward to a month after being broken up, and no contact. She still has all of our pictures up on social media, and never changed the relationship status (but added a bunch of exes??) I reached out on her birthday because I found out she was spending it alone, and I wanted to atleast wish her a happy birthday. I didn\u2019t try to carry on a conversation. I still cared for her deeply, and the thought of her being alone on that day really devastated me. She then reaches out to  talk. I find out she\u2019s going through hard times with family issues (I would always help her through these during our relationship). \n\nShe then drops the bomb that she was pregnant with my child, and had a miscarriage. It broke me. All I ever wanted was my own family, and it felt like for a brief moment I had it, and lost it. I couldn\u2019t imagine what she was going through, I just knew I didn\u2019t want her to go through it alone.\n\n\nWhen we talked on the phone it was very emotional. I asked if she wanted to make plans for her Bday so she could celebrate it with someone, because her friends and family did nothing for her. She said she would like that very much. We went out to dinner, and she had this look like she was still in love with me, and said how much she missed me, we hugged for a long time that night.\n\n\nSoon she gets into another fight with her family, and wants to see me to hang out again. I agree, and we end up being intimate, and it\u2019s like when we first started dating. She even comments how much she missed that old feeling, and I had to agree it felt like a restart. I begin getting texts again randomly wishing me a good day, and other things along those lines. I start making more effort to plan days to see her again, even if just for an hour. I really didn\u2019t care as long as I saw her, and knew she was okay. When we see each other its great. We don\u2019t argue like we used to, (although she does use this time vent a lot). We also talk about future plans, and we usually end up kissing at least by the end of it.\n\n\nThen all of a sudden she no longer messages me back as quickly, which then turns to at all some days. I might get a reply from her a couple hours later, and she seems sincere when she does reply or reschedules days to hang out, but it does hurt when you can see this person was on social media, but ignored your text. According to her this is \u201ca habit she has with everyone now\u201d. Just this weekend we had made plans for us to watch a movie together, but I was told her car is in the shop for a few weeks. When I said I can get us an Uber to take to the city and we can spend the day out, I received no response. Today she\u2019s posting selfies being out. I\u2019m really trying to make it work, because I was given hope, but am realizing I may just be being used as a distraction\/ego boost when she needs it.\n\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve been more confused. Im starting to feel really stupid because I initially went no contact only to break it, because I felt it was the right thing to do. Now my mental health is suffering, and I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m overthinking or should pay closer attention to the signs. I really began to believe we would get back together, and make things work. She knew my intentions, because I made them transparent from the beginning. I\u2019m starting to feel played with, and led on so she could use me to heal herself, but now I\u2019m left alone all the time wondering while it feels like she\u2019s slowly moving on, and doing her own thing.\n\nTL\/DR\nI originally went no contact then found out my ex was pregnant with my child, and had a miscarriage. I chose to be there for her as much as possible, and it began feeling like a restart. Now I\u2019m realizing I may just have been being used to make her feel better until she could move on.\n\nNot sure what insight anyone might share, or who would even take the time to read all this, but writing it out helped I guess.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678665950.0},{"title":"Advice pls\ud83d\udc8c","author":"Jlove1355","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/BreakUps\/comments\/11p4sun\/advice_pls\/","text":"I\u2019m 40 days no contact and I want to call my ex so bad right now.

This was after I had asked her to talk on Friday and she decided to reschedule last minute to Monday. Since then, a mutual friend of ours who initially kind of paired us up, told her that I had been bad mouthing her, when really I was just venting and at this point she\u2019s kind of my only friend.\n\nThat pissed her off, and she says \u201cAll you wanna do is run your mouth to my best friend so no I don\u2019t want to talk to you and there\u2019s nothing to say we\u2019re done and that\u2019s it time to move on.

We had met by chance and struck up a friendship. We have been intimate (had sex) and have flirted in the past. We always had a good bond.\n\nAnyway, as life happens, we both got into relationships and stopped talking for a while. After my break up, we got back in touch and restarted our chats. I found out that she hadn't been doing too well - she had a break up of her own from a possessive, negative ex-boyfriend. She was also have some family issues and had been in a bit of a struggle for money - she also had some mental health issues (not sure how significant, but it was clear that at times she was low). We still had good chat.\n\nTime went on and we had often talked about meeting up again, just to catch up, share our tales of woe and whatever. But for one reason or other it never happened. It seemed like she was lonely and would seem keen to meet up to talk face to face - but life and work etc seemed to get in the way.\n\nSo we kept chatting on Snapchat etc, until one day, I noted that I hadn't heard from her in a few days. I checked my messages and realised she hadn't read my last message - no big deal. I left it a week and followed up with her to ask how she was. Nothing.\n\nIt's been like 3 months and I've heard nothing since and I am not sure whether it is a case of her simply not wanting to talk, or whether it is something I should be worried about (in relation to her mental health).\n\nI've tried at various points to reach out to her on different platforms but none of my messages are read and she hasn't posted anything on her socials for months either. Just seems a bit odd - like she has disappeared. It's not like she is talking to anyone else either, she's just vanished. she's still my friend on social media so I can see there has literally been no activity from her for months, around the same time she went silent on me. no stories, no comments etc. It was her birthday and she had not replied to any birthday messages from friends either.\n\nI figured the only thing I can do now is leave it alone and accept that either she doesn't want to talk, or when she does want to talk again she will reach back out to me.\n\nEither way, it just seems very odd and out of character for her. I can't imagine she's angry with me or anything as our last chat was fun and discussing a possible meet up. So no idea what has happened. I do recall, looking back, that she was quieter than usual the last time we had been messaging.\n\nAny thoughts? I really do hope she is okay and wouldn't want to think anything has happened to her. But her disclosure about mental health has been playing on my mind a little.  I've messaged a few times now so not really sure what else to so other than call her. But for some reason this feels too intrusive - especially if she just doesn't want to talk to me anymore.\n\nI don't know, it is just a strange situation.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678663020.0},{"title":"Never thought it would happen over the phone after the better part of a decade.","author":"Dry_Shine_3233","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/BreakUps\/comments\/11pfrll\/never_thought_it_would_happen_over_the_phone\/","text":"Two months ago my wife's Dad passed away (and he wasn't very old), we went to Hungary to sort the funeral out. Whilst we we were, dealing with the family, the grief, the upset, and the sight of his body in the morgue, etc, my wife brought up the idea of us becoming an open couple. Initially I was on board, mainly because I thought well we're both young, we don't want to end up resenting on another because we kept one another all to ourselves. As the conversation went on, I had to wrangle out of her the fact that she wants to be with my best friend, and that she doesn't want to hurt me.\n\nI love her so much, I said that's okay, and that she has nothing to feel guilty about. I had some reservations, and I wanted us to put more emphasis on our own sex life which had been slipping into a dull routine of doggy and missionary. I thought this would be the spark we needed, but when we got back and our sex life was exactly the same I realised this open relationship idea wasn't going to work. I told her and she was upset and said \"let's forget this ever happened\" and I agreed.\n\nAfter that, for the next month she stopped talking to me, she slept with her back to me, if I tried to hug her she shook me off. One time I declared my love for her with a monotone \"I love you so much\" which she said nothing to.\n\nThen she went to stay at her Mom's while her Mum was in Italy, it was only when she texted me saying \"I'm going to stay at my Mom's for a few more days.\" that I really began to suspect that this wasn't me giving her space to grieve her father, it was me giving her the space to leave me. She came back to the house with a friend, neither of them were interested in talking to me. They just packed my wife's stuff and left, not even a goodbye.\n\nFor another two days she didn't contact me, so I called her until she answered when she said, and in quite a catty tone \"yeah, I don't think it's working out.\" and \"well I'm going to look into getting a divorce\". It sounded like she was enjoying it, like she was blowing her nose and feeling the relief of being able to breathe again.\n\nMy Mom for some reason decided to text my wife and figure out what was happening, my wife sent her a very lawyer-sounding text about a lack of compatibility. Which confused me, because we felt very compatible. Maybe we were drifting, but I thought the point of relationships was to work with one another to make it work. I don't understand why she just threw her hands up and went. Especially when I found a letter she wrote for our anniversary that's dated just one year before all this, she says the exact opposite in the letter, and discusses how she's excited for our future together.\n\nI am trying to figure out how to shut down the little factory in my brain that's spent the last 8 years loving her, always figuring out ways to get better and more efficient at loving her. I'm surrounded by reminders of her, no matter how many pictures I take off the wall, or clothes I take out the wardrobe, I find something else. All this stuff numbs me now, and I kind of don't want to hide it all.\n\nAt the end of the day, I know I wasn't the perfect husband, I wasn't very good at helping when she was ill. I was immature (I mean, we did meet at age 16 so immaturity was kind of inevitable). I was distant and cold, but I still loved her deeply and tried to show her that as much as I could, she's European and they do way more emotion than us. I think it's how the language sounds that makes them be more upfront about their emotions.\n\nI want her back, but I also don't. She's hurt me very deeply with this, and I don't think I could ever trust her again if I took her back. I'm saying that like she even wants me back. I just feel sad for her, because she lost so many family in the run up to her father, and now she's pushing the only other person she really has. And it makes me sad that I was able to take a young girl who loved me so much, and twist her into someone who despises me. I don't know how to deal with this without putting myself down, everywhere I look I am reminded of my own failure, I have to play where's Waldo to find my successes.","upvote_ratio":0.84,"created_utc":1678631181.0},{"title":"It\u2019s been 5 months and I feel like I\u2019m moving backwards in progress","author":"driperica","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/BreakUps\/comments\/11psso6\/its_been_5_months_and_i_feel_like_im_moving\/","text":"I started dating my first love this summer before we left for college.

We had been going downhill for a few years and no one pumped the breaks to fix it. There was some back and forth following our split, but he ultimately chose to move forward with a new partner, met shortly after our break up. He is a wonderful person and deserving of this fresh start. \n\nUnfortunately, this was followed by the news I likely have MS (testing will confirm either way shortly). Now I\u2019m not only grieving him and letting go of a present and future with him (our adventures, home, kiddos) but even the future I thought I had with myself.\n\nMy friends and family are being 10\/10 wonderful, but of course, I\u2019d like nothing more than to sink into his arms, grieve this with him, and be physically comforted and held in a way a partnership can nurture you through hard news.

I know everyone\u2019s situation is painful in their own way, I\u2019m explaining my situation. \n\nFor a short backstory (you can see my previous post for more details) I dated a girl and fell very in love with her. We had both dated before but we both ended up telling each other we had never felt this way about anyone else (she initiated that convo and said other things like I\u2019m the best guy she\u2019s ever dated in every way etc etc) Ive been in other relationships, and I could safely say that this relationship was really great at first. She had a troubled past with some very dark traumas and also had a hard time being in tune\/talking about her feelings. I\u2019m not super lovey guy but sometimes I would say something nice and I could tell it just made her uncomfortable and that upset me a little but I was understanding. I finally brought it up respectfully just saying I\u2019d like if we could work on this. \n\nThis is when she dropped a bomb that she thinks my feelings are stronger than hers and that we\u2019re not compatible because of her issues\/ personality. This deeply hurt and confused me bc she was the one that initially kind of loved bombed me saying she\u2019d marry me \u201cso fast\u201d. Even her sisters were telling me \u201cI\u2019ve never seen her so into someone, she even brought up moving in with you\u201d\n\nFor a month she kept pulling back and blatantly disrespected me many times. I told her many times this is getting unbearable and why she\u2019s doing this. She told me she still loved me but she\u2019s going through things (I won\u2019t get into specifics bc it may trigger people) and is overwhelmed with life responsibilities. She would say she didn\u2019t want to break up but she thought it was unfair for me to be with her\u2026 (almost giving me permission). \n\nI tried to be patient but I was depressed and cried everyday\/felt sick because the person I loved with neglecting and disregarding me so much. I finally ended things and I was sobbing saying she left me no choice, she didn\u2019t have one tear in her eye and didn\u2019t look me in the face and was just fidgeting with her nails. I know she was suppressing her emotions but that hurt. She said she saw this as more of a break because she was gonna work on herself, but in my opinion if you push someone away and force them to leave so easily, you don\u2019t truly love them. \n\nI still to this day don\u2019t fully understand why this happened and I would have much rather her just dumped me and been truthful. It would have been way easier for me to move on. But instead when I left she was filling my head with false hope. (I told her I won\u2019t reach out but if she works on things I welcome her to reach out) It\u2019s been two months and I broke NC once just to tell her the basic I miss you stuff etc and she responded after two days just kinda saying she was going through a lot. I said I was sorry and that If she needs anything I\u2019m there. She said thank you. Since that NOTHING. and I\u2019ve accepted that I probably won\u2019t ever hear from her and I\u2019ve started my healing\/moving on process.

I had landed a nice office job at a health care company. Good pay , reasonable hours , vacation time and all.  When I first started this job I was so afraid I wasn\u2019t a medical professional I just got lucky and knew the right people. I hit the ground running , no not even running I was sprinting. In my short time there I had earned everyone\u2019s respect and even started getting noticed by the owners , it went so well I was rubbing elbow with the bosses. I wasn\u2019t promoted to HR but I was already doing alot of the work. I was unstoppable. The bosses would now include me in there HR meetings and I was only 3 months in, Here\u2019s when the devil came for me. Around march my coworkers introduced me to a new receptionist who I would be working closely with, I guess you know what happened next , we flirted one thing led to another and we\u2019re on our first date. The connection was so strong, everything was going well for us. She started acting like a wife after our first date she brought me lunch , coffee, I met her family. The second date comes rolling around and I said to myself it\u2019s time to make things official. She deserved to be my GF or so I thought. At the end of the date she asked if we could go to a view over looking Los Angeles I said to myself this is the perfect time to ask her to be official with me. So we get there and I did , she smiled and paused she said she had strong feelings for me but wanted to take things slow , there wasn\u2019t anything wrong it just wasn\u2019t a great time for her to start a new relationship she wasn\u2019t in a good place because her house was collapsing behind the scenes . But we agreed we were on the same level of feelings and we were gonna take things slow. She even went as far as to plan our 3rd date for the following week. Her idea not mine, I never even brought up a 3rd date yet.  The following week rolls around and we have to cancel her mother is graduating college , this was true I saw all the pictures.  But suddenly in that week she goes quiet she\u2019s not responding to my text enthusiastically anymore. Then one day she goes absolutely quiet I get worried but I\u2019m not the type of person to spam text someone , I assume she\u2019s busy and go about my day. Monday comes rolling around and she tells me she\u2019s been quiet because her mother is in the hospital after a serious car accident and she breaks us up in the process, I was hurt and confused I had questions but I knew it wasn\u2019t the right time to ask anything. A couple of days later I see her mother and I assume perhaps it\u2019s a good time to reach out. So I did I asked if she was okay and why did we have to take a break. The look in her eyes I wasn\u2019t talking to same person anymore. She tells me \u201c it\u2019s not you it me I haven\u2019t been single for a long time and I want to enjoy it. Move on it was only two dates \u201c  I was in shock I didn\u2019t know what to say but I respected her feelings and let the matter drop. A week later I hear that he mother is spreading roomers about me , saying how I\u2019m weird and I begged her daughter not to break up with me . This wasn\u2019t true I never begged I didn\u2019t even put up much of a protest.  My heart was broken how could someone I treated like an absolute queen be saying such horrible things about me . I confront her and she denies everything. I knew she was lying because there was topics in our conversation that were brought up in the roomer and it was things only her and I knew. But I didn\u2019t want to fight I chose to believe her \u201c if she says she didn\u2019t do it she didn\u2019t do it \u201c is what I said but deep down I knew it was her. A month passes by and she\u2019s completely dodging me every time I pass by she looks down when ever I have to contact her for work related reasons she short and snappy with her responses. I decided to go to her desk and say \u201c hey I hope we can still work together\u201d she says of course. This is when things get darker. Covid starts spiking in the office and I caught it I had to take two weeks off and she texts me out of the blue that she wanted a few days off because she had a huge fight with her mother and didn\u2019t want to work and if I could help her. I said no , for many reasons 1 i think its illegal to share Covid tests and I didn\u2019t want to find out and 2 she\u2019s nothing of mine anymore I have no reason to do such a huge favor for her, 2 weeks later and I returned to work I had found out she had been fired because she claimed she had Covid with no proof so they fired her for job abandonment. I was sad but I understand, about a week later I get called to the office my boss wants to speak with me. I was being fired \u201cfired why !?\u201d It\u2019s turns out my ex before leaving tried to come back a few days later and when she was confronted she spun a web of lies saying I had given her a test so she could call out ( this was a lie I told her no) but my boss wasn\u2019t hearing me out and my boss had informed me dating in the work place was not a violation but its frowned upon. So they fire me. My parents are absolutely upset with me they kicked me out for a day. I lost everything over a lie. A few months pass by and I decided to cut off all ties to her I said my goodbye and unfollowed her from everything. A few months pass and I\u2019m getting back up on my feet , I hang out with friends, I go on dates I even scored s better job with less work. Thats when my sister told me something that destroyed me and I don\u2019t understand why it affected me so much. It turns out some girls that knew my ex had told my sister that my ex had a sugar daddy a guy in his 40s and they have been seeing each other for a while even in the time we were seeing each other . This is all a speculation at the moment but if this is true I\u2019m so hurt \u2026 she cheated on me , my relationship was never real. She was pretending to be a sweet innocent woman but in reality she belonged to the streets.

Since my last post, due to the fact that my ex and I still work together and I saw firsthand how much he\u2019s chosen to change his circumstances that led to our breakup for his new gf, I had a bit of a relapse. But I have since had an epiphany that has helped me tremendously to process it all and move on for good. I figured sharing this epiphany\/metaphor may help some of you to do the same.\n\nSo when I adopted my dog Rory 8 years ago, she\u2019d been sitting at the rescue for months. She\u2019s a beautiful dog, and she was always good with other dogs, cats, and children. There\u2019d been lots of potential adopters who came to meet her. But none of them panned out, because they all felt \u201cno connection\u201d with her.\n\nRory landed herself in the shelter in the first place because her first family who bought her from the breeder - and her second family after that - kept Rory out in the yard all day. She\u2019s half Husky, half American Bulldog - which means that she\u2019s equal parts rambunctious energy, and loads of loving affection and FOMO. But none of that mattered to her previous owners; they still relegated her to the yard.\n\nIt was no surprise for me to hear that at both homes, she would frequently clear the six-foot fence, run wild, and almost get hit by a car.\n\nWhen I met her, she was very aloof. But I could sense immediately that under that tough exterior, she had the biggest, softest heart (not unlike myself). I adopted her on the spot.\n\nSince then, I spent years honing and channeling that energy of hers (she\u2019s now an Advanced level Canine Good Citizen, and she\u2019s also done agility and therapy work) and bringing her across the country on all kinds of adventures with me and my friends and family (she\u2019s even been on a whale-watching boat!). She is also, as predicted, hands-down the most affectionate and intuitive dog I\u2019ve ever had.\n\nI can\u2019t tell you how many people over the years have told me how much they wish their dog was like Rory.\n\nSo the revelation I had about all of this concerning my breakup is as follows:\n\nMy ex broke up with me, in a nutshell and without giving too much personal details, because I was \u201casking for too much\u201d. For me, our relationship had become the equivalent of him relegating me to the yard and coming out to spend time with me and give me affection only when it suited him. Meanwhile, I was meant for so much more - to be a life partner and adventure buddy. \n\nMy ex and I still work together, and he has since gotten into another relationship - in which, it appears, he\u2019s giving her everything he told me he was incapable of giving me. But that\u2019s okay. Maybe he learned something from our relationship and engaged in some self-reflection and improvement. Or maybe he never loved me enough to put in the effort. It\u2019s not my job to know or to figure out why things happened that way. I gave our relationship 110% - and while I learned some important things about myself as a partner and relationships in general, I have no regrets for the kind of girlfriend I was to him. All I can do is accept it, work on bettering myself for the next person I\u2019ll fall in love with someday, and move on.\n\nIn that same vein, Rory wasn\u2019t given up because she didn\u2019t deserve her old families. She was given up because they didn\u2019t deserve her. They stunted her potential instead of tapping into it and supporting its realization.\n\nNow, she\u2019s living her best life. And not only my life, but so many others\u2019 lives, have been enriched for having her in them. I\u2019m not exaggerating when I say that for all the time, love, and energy I\u2019ve put into giving her a full and happy life, she\u2019s paid it back ten-fold.\n\nSo, I choose to have faith in the fact that someday, I\u2019ll meet my person. He will recognize my value. He\u2019ll see my needs as a privilege to fulfill - not a burden - and enjoy sharing the kind of life I deserve with me.\n\nAnd if you too were broken up with for \u201casking too much\u201d, perhaps, you should count your lucky stars that you\u2019re no longer a \u201cyard dog\u201d yourself. Even if you\u2019re still \u201cat the shelter\u201d waiting for your person right now; and even if your old \u201cfamily\u201d has since found another; and perhaps, even if they are being better to them than they ever were to you - the right person for you will find you someday. And because they\u2019re the right person, you won\u2019t need to sacrifice your needs for their comfort or convenience. Because they\u2019ll meet you exactly where you are. All you can do is put in the work on your end to ensure you\u2019re ready for them.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678643211.0},{"title":"Will an ex Come back if they Say they will looking for a male perspective","author":"ImJustaCatGuys","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/BreakUps\/comments\/11pf2q5\/will_an_ex_come_back_if_they_say_they_will\/","text":"I dated my ex on and off for +3years. even on the offs we still talked and acted like a couple and never cut off contact we were each others first loves and first boyfriend and girlfirend.

I'm a 20 year old (M) college student who used to work with a much older woman (35F). I always found her attractive. In my eyes she was the the prettiest woman I've ever seen in my life (she actually looked much younger than her age).\n\nAnyways we started talking at work and we had chemistry. We pretty much liked the same things and we had great conversations. As  time went on and on, things got more intimidating. She started starring at me in a very intimadating way. She also started texting me daily and consistently. I knew that she was in a relationship with another guy and i just thought she was just being friendly.\n\nBut one day, she told me to hang out after work together. And we did. I had an amazing time with her. I honestly haven't met anyone that interesting in my life. As i was walking her home, she caught me off guard and kissed me. It was the sweetest kiss I've had ever experienced. I told her i liked her a lot and so did she. I always had in my mind that i shouldn't get into other people's relationship and i genuinely felt bad about her boyfriend. But i couldn't resist to her, it was magical. \n\nWe worked for 3 months together (basically all summer). This was honestly the best time of my life. We started dating somehow. (we kept it between us, but we started seeing each other a lot). She's the most amazing woman I've ever met, idk if her age makes me think of that. Maybe it's her maturity Thad made me fell so hard for her? I'm not sure. Anyway, the thing after summer was over, i left the job, because of college. And after this happened she somehow disappeared. She suddenly started texting me rarely and she was cold, but nothing had happened between us. I kept texting her and asking about how she was, but after some time she ghosted me.\n\nIt's been half a year since we texted each other. I honestly can't stop thinking of her. She's been living in my head 24\/7, i can't concentrate on anything and most importantly in my studies. I just think of her and cry, i can't even listen to music anymore, because we had the same taste and the songs remind of her, why did she do that to me? Why she initiated the whole thing if she's was going to do that without explain anything to me. She promised me that she would keep in touch with me no matter what. And i believed her. I know the age gap is huge, but i didn't mind, that's what she said as well. I feel like i was being used.  \n\nI also bear in mind that she was cheating on her boyfriend, and i don't know if i would like to be with someone who's a cheater. I just feel so depressed and don't know how to get over her. I know some of you might say you can find other people as well, but i literally had one gorgeous girl asking me to have sex with her and i declined, because while she was talking with me, i was only thinking about her. It feels like I've developed an obsession with her and it's unhealthy. I've been with other women before, but this just felt so special to me, i can't really explain it. I feel so blank. I've been waiting for a text from her every single day, and the urge of texting her is huge, idk if she's gonna reply or not. did she just play me? I just crave of seeing her just one more time. She stigmatized me. Every other girl i meet, i subconsciously compare her to her and she's always better. I can't feel anything for other girls and it's been a long time. I'm so embarrassed of going to therapy because a woman 15 years older played me like that. \n\nTL;DR i had an affair with a much older co-worker, and when she left the job she stopped texting to me, but i can't get over her.\n\nPS: excuse me for my English, im Argentinian.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678650233.0},{"title":"Is that good?","author":"Urc-Baril","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/BreakUps\/comments\/11pngeg\/is_that_good\/","text":"The breakup happenend 4 months ago, really hard for both of us.

It was a brutal, harsh, blindside kind of situation after 4 years together. I lost my best friend, roommate, and boyfriend in an instant, over the phone (quite the move on his part given that we live together). I've been through it all since: I almost dropped out of my grad program. I still might. I have cried so hard almost each day. I lost a ton of weight. I isolated myself from friends and family because I didn't feel like I could trust anyone anymore. I'm in therapy. I have nightmares. I jump between recognizing the harm he caused and missing him like crazy. I picked up on some harmful patterns throughout our relationship that I was in denial about. I am trying to pick up the pieces and live alone in our shared apartment with our cats. Some days I can't get out of bed. All that said, I really want to share the following advice. I am new to reddit, but I made this account after reading posts for three months because there's something I really want to say.\n\n**FIRST, A SUPER IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER:** The following does not apply to you if you have ended or are planning to end a relationship because you are in danger, feel unsafe, are facing or have faced abuse of any kind, or if you've been neglected, cheated on, etc. The line between dumper and dumpee  can be thin, complicated, and isn't even a relevant distinction to draw in some breakups. Please do whatever you need to do to stay safe or get to a safer place. I believe in you, and I'm sending you my virtual support and care. I really wish you the best.\n\nThe following also doesn't really apply to mutual breakups.\n\n**This applies to the people who are considering ending relationships, especially long term ones, because they lost feelings, got bored, feel disconnected, have feelings for someone else, believe there are incompatibilities, etc.**\n\n**1)** I'm not going to go too much into what you should do before you actually break up with someone, but I see so many posts on here about regret. Maybe consider having a long and honest conversation, or series of conversations, with your partner. Have you asked for your needs to be met? Have you tried to reconnect if you're feeling a disconnect? Have you considered couples therapy? There could be a whole post on this, but just something to consider so that you aren't blindsiding your partner. Obviously some of this applies more to longer term relationships.\n\n**2)** This is the main point I want to make: EVERYONE HAS THE RIGHT TO LEAVE A RELATIONSHIP AT ANY TIME, AND YOU AREN'T OBLIGATED TO STAY. BUT I THINK WE ALL HAVE A MORAL OBLIGATION TO END RELATIONSHIPS WITH CARE AND RESPECT (again, if there's no abuse etc.). What does care and respect mean in this context? Here are some thoughts:\n\n* DO NOT ASSUME WHAT THE DUMPEE WANTS OR WHAT IS BEST FOR THEM! My dumper kept telling me that he \"ripped off the bandaid\" because he thought it was the most respectful thing to do. He never asked me. I wanted an opportunity to have some processing conversations, to honor the 4-year relationship we had, and to work together to detangle our lives. I never got that opportunity. I am left with many unanswered questions and no sense of finality. I can create closure for myself, as many of us have had to, but you CAN make things easier on your partner by answering their questions honestly and respectfully. You can ask them if more or less conversation is easier right now. You can give them more than a single text.\n* YOU CAN SET BOUNDARIES AND CARE FOR YOURSELF WITHOUT BEING COLD AND CRUEL. Please read that again. You are allowed to need space. You and your ex can talk about no contact, and whether that's a good option for you both. Notice how different this is from ghosting. You can say things like \"I want to be really clear that I don't want a romantic relationship with you, but I care about you and wanted to see if you wanted to have a few more conversations before pausing our contact\" etc. You can be clear that something is over and still express that it mattered to you.  Just because you lost feelings for someone does not mean that they no longer matter or don't deserve your respect! Be a clear and honest communicator! What can and can't you handle right now? Tell your partner! I've talked to people who ended relationships and came up with some creative ways to transition out of them together. Stuff like: spending one more special weekend together, scheduling one phone call per week for the next two months (but no other contact), discussing taking space then becoming friends, writing each other final closure letters. The possibilities are endless. None of those things might be healthy or right for your breakup, and that's ok! You don't have to do them. Cutting off contact might be healthiest!  The point is that you can communicate what you need and what you're going to do before you do it. You don't have to go cold and make someone feel like they don't matter.\n* PEOPLE SEEM TO THINK IT'S EASIER TO MOVE ON FROM THEIR PARTNERS WHEN THEIR PARTNERS ARE COLD AND CRUEL. And I get it. My ex turned into a different person overnight. It was awful. Not only did he go cold, he started saying really cruel things. He took apart my entire character piece by piece. He told me I would be a bad parent. He blamed every problem in our relationship on me. He told me he's happier without me and looking forward to dating other people. It made me feel like I had cheated or something (I hadn't). It messed with my head. He said some stuff so bad I don't even want to write it here. And to be honest, in some ways, his behavior has made it  easier to push him away.  But in addition to going through the grieving process, I've also been questioning my own sense of reality and battling the worthlessness that has come with the hurtful things he flung at me. Grieving is hard enough, and I wish I didn't also have to deal with feeling unsafe and and wondering if I can trust future partners. BREAKUPS ARE PAINFUL AND MESSY NO MATTER WHAT. Someone ending it with care doesn't change that. But it might be possible to reduce the suffering just a bit. It's really hard when you go from being someone's partner to feeling absolutely worthless and like they don't give a crap about you overnight.\n\n**3)** THERE ARE NO HARD AND FAST RULES ABOUT HOW TO BREAKUP WITH SOMEONE. But please consider for a moment if there's ANYTHING you could do to make it easier on the dumpee. Again, you aren't obligated to stay. But think about how you are making a unilateral decision when you used to be a team. Even if you really believe this is best for both of you, it's going to be hard that they were not part of the decision-making. They have no autonomy in this situation. So consider asking them some questions and validating how they are feeling. Let them set their boundaries. Let them tell you what they need. You may not be able to provide it , but having that conversation is a sign of maturity and respect. Do they still feel confused about your intentions? Do they want you to ask how they're doing sometimes, or would that be more painful? Again, not every breakup will lend itself to these kinds of conversations. I'm just saying that you are allowed to ask someone how they feel. And you can still have clear boundaries and not lead them on. It just requires communication! Don't be manipulative! Please understand that the dumpee may need to not hear from you at all in order to heal, and they are allowed to ask for that! But also don't assume that that's what they want! \n\n**4)** PLEASE DO NOT END LONG TERM RELATIONSHIPS (honestly probably most relationships) OVER THE PHONE OR TEXT (unless you're long distance or feeling unsafe etc.).\n\n**5)** PLEASE DO NOT GIVE THE DUMPEE DETAILS ABOUT YOUR SEX AND ROMANTIC LIFE (unless they have explicitly asked for it?) I did NOT want to know which dating apps my ex was on or how excited he was to hook up with X person. I still have nightmares about it.\n\n**6)** WE ARE ALL COMPLICATED HUMANS AND RELATIONSHIPS ARE COMPLICATED. You're allowed to make mistakes. You're allowed to be confused. But consider ending things with care because you just never know. Previous relationships of mine ended with care, and after a no contact period to deal with our lingering romantic feelings, we were able to maintain friendships. Those people still matter to me, and we're still on good terms. This most recent ex will never be my friend because I am afraid of him. He caused so much harm that I don't think I could trust him again. You never know when people will come in and out of your life. Nothing is static. Don't be mean to people who have been such a big part of your life. Even if you can't be together now or ever again, they don't deserve to be disparaged, lashed out at, manipulated, gaslit, etc. after or during a breakup (or anytime).\n\n**7)** RESPECT YOUR OWN BOUNDARIES AND THOSE CREATED BY YOUR DUMPEE. Understand these could evolve too. Someone might think they can handle friendship and then realize it's too painful. That's ok. But you can communicate this instead of ghosting. Use \"I feel\" statements. Talk about what you need instead of being patronizing about what the other person's needs. \"I feel like I need to stop texting because I'm not feeling comfortable with it right now.\" INSTEAD OF: \"You need to stop texting me and get over it, it's best for you to move on.\" Of course, if someone violates the boundaries you have set, you have a right to advocate for yourself and cut off all contact if needed.\n\n**8)** DON'T ASSUME YOU KNOW WHAT THE OTHER PERSON THINKS OR FEELS, EVER. I see dumpers on here all the time wondering if their dumpee would appreciate an apology, would appreciate friendship, would appreciate knowing they have regrets and want to try again. Who knows? We are all different. You can ask them if they want to talk. If they don't, they are doing what they need to do to protect themselves and heal, and you have your answer. You might ask whether they want to hear from you rather than send them paragraphs on paragraphs without their consent. Some people, myself included, would LOVE to hear an apology or list of regrets.\n\n**9)** BE AS CLEAR AS POSSIBLE. DO NOT LEAD PEOPLE ON. My ex told me he loved me and that I was his home days before dumping me on the phone. He flirted with me and had sex with me after the breakup, right before launching into a speech about how unqualified I am to be his future spouse. Don't be hot and cold. Be clear, set boundaries, be kind, be respectful. You don't have to run away or go cold just because this is hard or because you feel guilt. Again, YOU ARE ALLOWED TO LEAVE. No one is bound to their relationship. But the way you end it speaks volumes about you and could diminish suffering on both sides.\n\nSending you all love.\n\n(edited for formatting, spelling)","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678576438.0},{"title":"Facing Discomfort & Severe Pain Part 2","author":"Designer-Home1047","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/BreakUps\/comments\/11pn0eg\/facing_discomfort_severe_pain_part_2\/","text":"\nToday, I had a talk with my crush and she was literally over the moon of getting married.

I know this is the same old song and dance so many people have gone through here but like a lot of you...I think this girl is special.\n\n I(29) was seeing her (25)  for a little over two months. I have had a lot of short term relationships and only really one that lasted over 2 years. None of which I was terrible broken up about but I have never fallen for someone like this, both the good and the bad I found her so relatable and breaktakingly beautiful \n\nI met her in work and from our first date we just clicked, it got really intense really quickly but I think we were both loving it. She was so open and honest about the good and bad in her life, that for once it really got me to open up. I am usually very closed off at first. We quickly started spending a lot of time together, mostly instigated by her which was a refreshing change for me. Sex was incredible, all day and all night, we laughed and chatted all night. We were regularly chatting over the phone and everything just felt amazing for the first time in years ( for me anyway).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe often spoke about her anxiety and depression, her mothing passed away a little over a year ago after a long battle with cancer. Along with other childhood, relationship issues and men being absolute creeps to her in the world. Which I could relate to somewhat, obviously not for the same reasons but I am someone that battled with depression and anxiety most of my life.\n\nShe went away with some girl friends for two weeks towards the end and again the whole time calling me regularly, sending pictures and texting. Upon coming back she did say she was concerned things were going very quickly between us, which I did think too but I was really enjoying her company so I tried not to overthink it. I just said we can just go with the flow and see what happens, that I was having fun etc.\n\nNow to the last weekend I spent with her (where I may have over done it?) Friday - All night having sex, incredible. I did not want it to end. She was supposed to be going out with friend on Saturday night but said she wasn't sure if she wanted too, I suggested she can come hang out at mine if she wanted too...She said aww that's so sweet but I should see my friends. I said that's okay, have a good night.\n\nSpent all Sunday together in bed hungover watching movies, no sex, just lying there chatting away.\n\nMonday morning I left, throughout the day she texted me multiple times saying how she was having a really bad day, overwhelmed, anxiety, wanting to quit her job - I sympathized with her, that it will be okay. Monday blues etc. In an attempt to cheer her up I offered to cook dinner on Valentines day (I did invite myself to hers to do so...)....This is where I think I may have been \"smothering\" her\n\nPoof - MIA - Barely a word out of her for two days.\n\nSo I rang her on my way home from work, met up. She looked rattled, visible distressed. We had a long chat about us, she iterated that she was just having a really hard time, feeling overwhelmed, unsure what to do with herself and that maybe she needs to stop seeing me, it was getting too serious and Bad timing etc.\n\nOf course I respected that, I know how it feels to have so much on your mind you can barely put your shoes on let alone be with someone else. So we talked about life and all its troubles, I told her its okay to be unsure and overwhelmed. That I am a lot of the time, not sure about my job or where I am going but just take it day by day. Eventually said our goodbyes and I went home.\n\nWe have briefly texted since, I checked in with her to see how she was getting on and She said she had been thinking about me and hopes I am doing well.\n\nI did ask her to go for a coffee two weeks ago but she had gone home to see family and have had no contact since.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy question to all of you lovely people: Should I let her come to me and maintain no contact or send her a message saying something along the line of... \"I know you were feeling overwhelmed at the time, I hope I wasn't smothering you and that I really enjoyed hanging out with you, you are a lot of fun\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAny and all advice would be greatly appreciated, particularly from a girls point of view.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678645708.0},{"title":"Don't know what to do","author":"Charming-Change-7057","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/BreakUps\/comments\/11plp2x\/dont_know_what_to_do\/","text":"Me and my boyfriend of 9 years recently broke up.

We drifted apart and we never spent time together and we both thought that the other had lost feelings. For me, I just felt so neglected and lonely towards the end and I was tired of always being the one to fix things. He never tried to fix things and never talked about his feelings with me. But I still loved him so much and I still do.\n\nTwo weeks ago i called him and told him that I wanted to fix things when he was ready and he told me that he just wants to be alone and that he can never see us together again. His reasoning was that he couldn't get over something I did over a year ago and that it was too much for him and that he kept avoiding telling me this cuz he didn't want to hurt me. I always thought we worked through that we even moved in together and were talking about marriage. And when we broke up he told me I was the best girlfriend ever and that all the happiness I've brought him outweighs anything negative. But it just doesn't seem true anymore he doesn't love me anymore and he doesn't miss me like I miss him. What happened? Before he told me that we could see what happens in the future when he's more stable with work and school. But now it's gone everything he felt seems to be gone just like that. Meanwhile, I haven't been able to stop thinking about him every day these past months how do I stop? How do I move on and how do i stop hoping that he will change his mind and come back to me?\n\nDuring this phone call, I also asked him to go no contact because I just can't see his name on my screen knowing he doesn't love me anymore. And he seemed so okay and glad about me asking that like he didn't even care anymore and that hurt, it really hurt. \n\nIt just feels so unfair that I'm the only one of us hurting of course I don't wish him to feel this way, I wouldn't wish it on anyone. But I just wish he still loved me and wanted me like I want him but I have to learn that everything can't be fixed.

We left on a good note (distance broke is apart, no lost feelings), so I can at least take solace that I\u2019m able to text her whenever and she\u2019ll respond, but I don\u2019t want to. I know it\u2019ll make me feel worse, so it\u2019s almost the same as her having me blocked, it\u2019s a mental barrier from texting her for my own good, no matter how much it hurts to not text her. Anyways, it\u2019s been awhile since the breakup and I\u2019ve felt significantly better since the start. I\u2019d say I\u2019m 95% better. I still think about her a lot, but not as much as I used to and I don\u2019t have the same emotional connection to those memories with her. But every once in awhile, I do have an emotional connection to them. It\u2019s usually because of a trigger, in todays case it was a song, but I\u2019m feeling pretty sad about it. It kinda just hit me that I\u2019ll probably never see her again. She offered to hangout over the summer when we met up back when we were both home from winter break to get solid closure (we had to officially breakup over FaceTime because we were 600mi apart, so we agreed to meet up and talk about it in person over winter break). Anyways again, I don\u2019t think I want to hangout with her due to it not being good for me no matter how much I want to, so Ik we\u2019ll probably never see each other again.

She even told me over winter break that we\u2019d still be together if it weren\u2019t for the distance. It\u2019s just sad to see our relationship end over something that was out of our control when it could have lasted much longer.

We were together for 1 and a half years and this was unexpected. We never had a real fight and thought we got along and loved each other. I still don't understand why she wants this. \n\nShe said she want a more mature relationship, kids until she is 30, someone to live with and basically a better boyfriend. I also wanted a stable relationship with her but it seems she rushes it and is not want to put in the work. After I tried to convince her that I want the same things she does and we should be together she gave me the final response: she stopped loving me for about 2-3 months and did not know how to break up with me. She says she still loves me as a friend and does not regret our relationship. It is also her first true relationship. She also said that she want to be single and each of us should work on our own development.\n\nWhen I heard that she made her mind and doesn't want to put in the effort of fixing our relationship I was extremely hurt and blocked her on all social media and whatsapp. From what a friend that keeps in contact with her said this really upset her and she also blocked me and doesn't want to talk to me again.\n\nThe issue is I still love her and care about her. We are both loners and even if we are not a couple anymore I still want her around as a friend to support. I have spoken to her in 4 days and it hurts like hell. A breakup while lacking friends is one of the worst things you can go through.\n\nShould I contact her by email and ask if the offer of friendship is still available? I want to explain that I did not block her because I don't want her in my life anymore, just that stalking her online would have been torture for me.\n\nAny advice is welcome.

I blamed myself because I thought I wasn\u2019t good enough for him. I started working out eating healthy and got an amazing job promotion. 2 1\/2 months after the breakup, he reaches out trying to get back with him. Wasn\u2019t a coincidence that it was also the same day he moved across the world to work for his dad for 3 months because he was forced to by his parents since he would do nothing here. He\u2019s a daddy\u2019s boy, completely depends on his family for everything. \n\nWe end up getting back together and manage to do long distance for a month and a half. I was so happy to have him back in my life I felt like the luckiest girl alive to have everything I wanted. We decided to meet up in London since it was in the middle of us for a weekend. I didn\u2019t see it in the moment but there were so many red flags on that trip. I was so happy to be with him I was blinded. For starters you would think that a guy who hasn\u2019t seen his gf since October would be all over her and obsessed with her and make the most out of every second with her. Even though he said he was happy to be there and loved me looking back, something was definitely off.\n\nWhen we got back we were still going to do a month and a half of long distance. That whole week we were back I felt really off. Even though we were talking everyday like normal I had a gut feeling something was off and that made me really depressed. The following week he\u2019s communicating more than usual, being so reassuring and I was like perfect everything is back on track. But I still had a gut feeling to look at his Instagram followers (mine are in order) and I see he followed girls and liked there picture. Idk why my first instinct was to make a hinge account with his location. He was the first guy that appeared and I was in complete shock. I confronted him ab it and he ignores me the whole day goes off with his day by posting stories on Instagram and completely ignoring the situation. \n\nWhen he finally calls me I ask him wtf is going on and he answers \u201cwhy do you think I\u2019m on hinge to fuck hoes obviously, but I still love you\u201d. That broke my heart. Even after that I made the mistake to beg him to work it out and he told me that I wasn\u2019t the one and that he doesn\u2019t care to lose me forever. He was completely insensitive and his tone was I don\u2019t give a fuck. He literally told me \u201cI just want you to fuck off from my life\u201d. I kept begging and begging like an idiot and convinced him to take time apart so we can think about it. I ended that call so disappointed in myself for begging such a horrible person to stay with me. I texted him after the call and gave him what he wanted, I ended it. I also told him he had a tiny penis because first of all he does and this guys ego is through the roof and really needed to be humbled.\n\nAs for me right now I\u2019m so disappointed with myself for giving this horrible person another chance. It took me this long to realize he\u2019s a selfish person that only cares about himself. I also know that he thinks he\u2019s so much better than me and he can do better when I was a person that was so beyond good to him. I was the realest relashionship he has ever had and the first person to show him what love is. All he did for me is judge me and make me feel like I was never enough for him. He would critique my body and tell me things like \u201cyou work bc you have to\u201d bc I don\u2019t have everything handed to me like he does. In reality I\u2019m so proud of myself for getting to the position I\u2019m in but he always made all my accomplishments look so little. He wants a girl with a butt that constantly works out and has rich parents. That\u2019s more important to him than real love and who knows maybe he finds a girl like that and it\u2019s true genuine love. Anyways I\u2019m just ranting now point is that I feel like shit bc I begged a guy that doesn\u2019t think I\u2019m good enough for him and thinks he is better than me. I begged a guy that had no remorse for getting caught cheating. And on top of that believed him when he told me he would never hurt me again. I realized I don\u2019t love him anymore I just feel so embarrassed and disappointed. Right now he\u2019s out living his best life while I\u2019m in a deep depression. And before anyone tells me but go live your best life I just don\u2019t have as much friends as he does. Also he will be back in a month and I\u2019m dreading the fact of ever running into him . This is just the worst situation.\n\nIf you made it this far your a trooper. I just hate how much control he had and how he thinks he\u2019s winning. I know this is bad to say but I want to see him suffer as much as I did. The worst part is that that guy only has good karma.

I\u2019ve been focusing on part 1 the most so far: things I love that are dear to me, that my ex frowned upon. Like listening to my favorite band and solo artist on full volume, cooking by my rules in my kitchen without his criticism in my ear, watching my favorite show that he could care less about. It could mean anything for anyone, so long as it\u2019s something you loved which they didn\u2019t appreciate.\n\nBut I\u2019m coming to realize part 2 might just be a critical component to healing, if not more compelling than the first. What I mean is not shying away from the things you loved that your ex also liked, that you shared memories together over. I love this tomato seafood pasta, and he cooked it for us once which I\u2019ll always remember. I couldn\u2019t bring myself to eat the same dish, let alone cook it, for a long time. I would get those waves of sadness and break down. I gave in to the power he had on me and accepted that he robbed me of a source of joy, as little of a thing as it may sound. But I recently cooked that dish and felt the growth. I felt like I took back ownership and lifted this weight of feeling robbed. I\u2019m trying to do the same in all aspects and make choices based on what I truly enjoy, rather than lying to myself and giving it to this lost relationship that should no longer hold me down.\n\nThe 3rd part is tapping into what it is that you may have loved at any point in this journey, but either didn\u2019t realize it or give it the time of day. Maybe it\u2019s a hidden talent or hobby, a knack for writing or poetry, a goal that\u2019s been collecting dust on the shelf. \n\nWhatever it is that speaks to you in any of these 3 parts, I encourage you to explore that space and honor it. It will hurt for some time. It will feel silly or futile at times. It will even feel like you\u2019re backtracking into the past. But it\u2019s up to us to make the decisions, big and small, that shape who we are and no one can steal that right from us. Not today. Not ever. Please let me know your thoughts below!

She said she didn't want to get back together and she wasn't interested in a relationship with anyone; so I spent a couple of months getting my head around that and move on. Some context we had been together for over 12 years and have 3 daughters together, I had wanted to split in the first place because I felt like she didn't love me anymore; she told me after we had broken up that she hadn't loved me for years so my feelings of not being loved was valid, but that didn't change the way I felt about her. Anyway one thing I told her I wouldn't be able to handle was if she moved on and found someone else before I was ready (she had said she wanted us to still be a family unit and get along as friends ect.) And she had promised she wouldn't. So I tried to make that a reality for her. Well a week ago I come home from work and my 4 year old had told me they went to meet a friend who gave them hugs and piggybacks; turns out she has been dating someone since the end of January 2023.

She hasn't shown any remorse for her decision and has pretty much asked me if I could move out, she wanted us to co-parent and to get along in the first place and I was doing it for her. Now I'm finding myself having to move out from my girls and start life again because of her. But I'm going to better myself and show my girls that I'm strong and they will always have me. I know this may seem wrong but I hope one day I can become so much more than I am that she will regret her choices. I gave her everything I could give her in our 12 years and after it was over all I asked for was time to make her dream a reality. Was I unreasonable.....","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678633842.0},{"title":"I got broke up with 4 days ago, after 1.3 years , on a phone call","author":"No-Drop960","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/BreakUps\/comments\/11pgrj7\/i_got_broke_up_with_4_days_ago_after_13_years_on\/","text":"Not so Fast version- he called me the night before our spring break trip when i was 2 hours away, and said he still had feelings for his ex after seeing her, and cant love 2 people at once (then later said he fell out of love with me 2 weeks ago.)\nAfter the call, where did he go?\nHis ex\u2019s house.\nRefused to message me back or call me the rest of the night after that bomb\nHe had been texting her behind my back for a little less than a week.\nHe refused to contact me on phone even on Thursday so i went to the location his phone told me.

My ex boyfriend broke up with me a bit over a month ago. Recently I've tried to rationalize why maybe this is for the best, even though I am a hopeless romantic and have often this \"love conquers all\" mentality. I'm trying to write out the facts (without trying to soften them or make excuses for him).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. He was quite mentally unstable. He had a severe chronic mental illness (BP1) which led to him being in the psych ward once during our relationship. He was medicated, but with his illness that isn't a complete cure and it wasn't working properly. His hospitalization happened very suddenly, because he is not best at predicting his moods. Obviously it was a scary and worrying experience and would've happened again at some point I think.\n2. I was worried that he would commit suicide and felt responsible for making sure that he ate a proper meal and overall tried to lift his mood by my presence. Only after the break-up have I realized how much responsibility I took for his survival.\n3. He was a sober alcoholic and had suffered from drug addiction only a bit over a year ago. He told me that he can't promise me that he will not relapse again if something terrible happens in his life. This all was linked to his mental illness.\n4. He had some debt that resulted from reckless money use\/being on sick-leave because of the illness. His current job was not that well paid that it would be easy to pay this debt soon. His debt would have probably made it impossible for us to buy an apartment together, something that I want to do in the future.\n5. At times I had a hard time with feeling sexual around him and I think it stemmed from me feeling like I'm a bit of a caretaker for him. Also he hadn't really been taking care of himself physically in the beginning which wasn't a problem at all at first but I feel like it really affected his self-esteem.\n6. He had told me how his illness had resulted in him messing up some of his previous relationship. Apparently there had been cheating etc. That made me think that it probably would've not been any easier with me in the long run.\n7. I've never really dreamt of a wedding (at least not a big one) but because of his debt I think it would've been financially impossible for us to arrange that (unless I paid for it all). That made me a bit sad honestly.\n8. He would sometimes just be quite apathetic and tired, due to his illness and medication. Sometimes I would've liked for us to do more activities together but I also sensed that he didn't really have energy for that. I just accepted that and often I felt a bit stuck.\n9. He was very sensitive so I needed to be really careful about my tone of voice and how I commented on things. He didn't express clearly if he was upset with something, I had to guess if something was wrong.\n10. We both wanted a family but I often had these fears of me being responsible for our kids - both financially as well as being the primary caretaker. He had a serious risk of not being able to work because of his illness and also I noticed how he often lacked motivation to do stuff by himself. For a partner that I would start a family with it would be really important that I could trust them to take care of the kid(s) when I'm not there, for example cooking for them etc.\n\nThese are some of the reasons I came up with. Obviously there were good things in the relationship as well, otherwise I would not miss him. I'm trying to look at this list to understand why it didn't work out and that maybe there is someone else out there that I could have feelings for who wouldn't cause me to have this uncertainty and worry.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678633506.0},{"title":"My ex sent me a vague message!?","author":"the_bread_pitt","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/BreakUps\/comments\/11pgjm0\/my_ex_sent_me_a_vague_message\/","text":"Hey everyone.

I didn\u2019t think things could get worse and I\u2019m now also experiencing heartbreak for the very first time and I don\u2019t know what to do. It hurts so much, I miss him so much and I\u2019m so angry that I do. I\u2019m angry that he broke our hearts. I\u2019m angry that he came to this decision by himself. I\u2019m angry that he disguised it as being for both of our sakes, because it feels like he did it for his own sake.\n\nHe\u2019s been with me for about four months. He was my closest friend at this time and I talked to him every day about everything. He made me smile, he helped me, he cared and accepted me and he was generally just good for me.\nThis was an online relationship. We had talked about whatever happens happen multiple times before, and we both seemed to be somewhat at peace with that.\nA couple days ago, he sent me a voice note, crying, telling me that he needs to let me go.\nIt seemingly came so out of nowhere and I couldn\u2019t believe what I heard. He said that it was because we had started to have too many feelings involved and he felt himself longing to be with me, but stated that it wasn\u2019t possible. I live in Denmark and him in England. I am not bound to Denmark and considered myself somewhat flexible. It\u2019s not impossible to see each other and see if we even get along in person I argued, but he told me that he had made up his mind. He made a decision that I thought was a mutual one. I wish we could\u2019ve talked about it before he decided to leave me. Before he turned so cold.\nThe very same night after I had cried the hardest in longer than I can remember, he had deleted his Reddit profile and removed me from Snapchat. I tried to message him in the hopes that I could clear his mind, but he never got them.\nYesterday I couldn\u2019t take it anymore and I texted him on his number which he gave me earlier on when there was still promises of not just leaving me.\nI told him that I needed closure. I wanted to know why he was doing all this when I was meant to believe that it hurt him too. \nHe said that he had come to love me and if we were to meet up, his feelings for me would become stronger and he is not willing to put in the work and emotional energy to have a long distance relationship now. Hearing that he doesn\u2019t want me. That I\u2019m not worth it to someone I care so deeply about just breaks me. I hate that he claims to want me. To love me.\nI\u2019m so angry that if he was so sure that nothing could become of this, that he didn\u2019t let our feelings for each other settle down and die naturally. He did it while we were both coming to realise that we loved each other and so deeply cared, that I can\u2019t help thinking that he never did care. He promised me that he wasn\u2019t leaving, but he did.\nI miss his company so much, I miss the butterflies, I miss looking forward to meeting, I miss being cared for, but he\u2019s gone. I want him back and it\u2019s destroying me. \n\nIt seems so stupid because it was all online, but I felt and feel so strongly towards him. I can\u2019t let him go, but I have to. I just want to feel his presence again. I want things to go back to what they were. \nEverything feels so meaningless. I feel like I have nothing left and that\u2019s a terrible feeling, but life really sucked before him and I can\u2019t process the fact that I\u2019m going back to that.\n\nI wish he would\u2019ve let us down slowly.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678631215.0},{"title":"I just have one question: when do the flashbacks stop?","author":"heartbreaketh","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/BreakUps\/comments\/11p038d\/i_just_have_one_question_when_do_the_flashbacks\/","text":"Most days I don\u2019t think of him anymore.

The pain was unreal, I was depressed, felt like I lost everything that mattered to me. Started thinking irrationally like, what if I never find anyone as beautiful again. What if I never feel this in love with anyone again. What if I never get the chance to be a father figure again(she has two kids who called me their stepdad). I started doubting what I even brought to the table. My ex makes a lot more money than me, her mom and sister never approved because of my job despite how great I was with her kids and how devoted I was to her family. I seriously never felt lower in my life. Then I decided instead of focusing on all the things I lost from this relationship, why don\u2019t I look at the positives so I started working on myself. \n\n\nI took the things I knew were true about me. 1.) I\u2019m great with kids and I now know for certainty that I want to be a father and have a family. 2.) I am in really good shape and I\u2019ve worked really hard to get to this point so don\u2019t stop now. 3.) that when I say I love someone and that I will always work through our problems, I actually mean it. 4.) I\u2019m a very caring and passionate person. 5.) I let my previous relationship before this one to cloud my judgement with trust issues. 6.) everyone has flaws, no one is perfect. We both made mistakes. but when you love someone and have issues, communication is key. No matter how small or how big yours or your partners issues are, let them be heard. Don\u2019t get mad at them and make them feel unjustified in their worries or feelings by calling them immature. If you really feel that way, go about it a different way. Put their mind at ease and comfort them so that if they really are that small then the two of you can laugh about it and joke. \n\n\nI got my ass back into the gym, I\u2019m going to get in better shape than I am already. I\u2019ve applied to more jobs in the last week than I did in the last 3 months. I already have an interview for tomorrow afternoon where I\u2019ll be putting my degree to use and working with kids. I matched with a beautiful woman on a dating app. I\u2019m not hopping into another relationship but it\u2019s nice to just talk to someone who\u2019s on that same level of beauty as my ex. My confidence has gone up so much within such a short period of time when just a couple days prior to that it felt like I had no confidence. Set goals for yourself, for me it\u2019s to save as much money as I can so I can move out of my parents and pay off my student loans. Another goal is find a better paying job that I\u2019m not miserable at. Another is (and I actually have my ex to thank for this) find a side hustle. I\u2019m going to start streaming video games. I\u2019m quite good at it and it\u2019s enjoyable so it\u2019s not even like I\u2019d be working. I won\u2019t start that until I find a new job though. Make yourself more attractive and the right partner will be drawn to you. I ignored a lot of the red flags with my ex because of the false statement she would tell me over and over. But when the right person comes along, you won\u2019t doubt the stuff they say, you won\u2019t see red flags because there won\u2019t be any there for you to see. Lastly, don\u2019t throw yourself a pity party like I did for a couple days. Acknowledge your self worth and if someone didn\u2019t appreciate what you brought to the table, someone else will. Am I mad at my ex? No, I never was. I was sad and depressed. Wished there was something I could\u2019ve done to change her mind at the time. But now I\u2019m seeing the silver lining, this is what I needed to happen. I\u2019ve finally put myself first. Plus she gave me something in the 3 months we were together that none of my other relationships have\u2026 she gave me the opportunity to realize I will make a great father. And that\u2019s something I will always be grateful for. I wish her the best and I honestly wish she would\u2019ve at least talked to me to convey this to her and say goodbye to the kids but it is what it is.

A couple of days ago I asked him jokingly if he would leave me if one of them showed interest in him and his reply was \u201cI\u2019d have to think about it\u201d. When I got upset he said \u201cwould you rather I lie to you?\u201d. I broke up with him because I can\u2019t be with someone who is unsure of me. I just feel like I wasted a year of my life loving lies. I\u2019m left with so many questions like why wasn\u2019t I good enough, am I not attractive enough, etc,, He was my first boyfriend and I\u2019m 22. I feel like I\u2019ll never get over him or no other guy will ever be interested in me.

I was dealing with alot in Nov\/Dev 2022, went through my first surgery due to an injury, was out of work for awhile which made me feel worse, had to stop gym and lost alot of my progress which I carefully made over the last year. My grandma got admitted to the high dependency unit, that was the first time I've seen someone so close to death, it was scary. I was devastated and the only thing I needed at this point was her support. Meanwhile, she was making a good life for herself abroad, making new friends, new job, I guess she felt content. She was so distracted she even forgot about my surgery lol, that was a hard pill to swallow.\n\n8 years we built something I thought was solid, although we had split in the past, we never moved on, always kept in touch and eventually got back together. Last couple years have been long distance as she stayed back in Australia after our studies while I wanted to return to our home country and work for abit, and eventually get my visa to return to Aus to settle down there. We trusted each other enough and respected our time apart, we were making it work. That being said, LDR was difficult no doubt; she was getting frustrated about the distance, I was getting anxious about my visa situation. However, in the midst of all the shit I was going through, I got news that my visa was approved (funnily enough I found out right as I came out of surgery). I thought finally we have something to look forward to, we can finally be together. We've been talking about living together for the last 2 years.\n\nOf course, I couldn't pack up and leave right away, I had to focus on my recovery, do my rehabilitation at the hospital every week, and start job hunting before I arrive in Aus as the visa is only temporary and would start the moment I get there. I thought it would be logical to at least try to secure a job before I arrive to make the most of the visa. I just wanted a few more months. My ex wasn't understanding about that, not even about me wanting to focus on my recovery. Those last few weeks were tough, and eventually, while I was in a middle of a panic attack, she told me she's been thinking of ending things. I couldn't believe it, this was someone I never doubted, to be there for me through thick and thin, but she was so occupied with her life there that I couldn't fit in it anymore, she wasn't even willing to wait until I get there to work things out at least.\n\nIt's been 2 months, and I just found out she's sort of seeing someone else. I was lowkey hoping we'd patch things up once I get there, but I think it's clear she doesn't care about me anymore. I have built up so much resentment towards her, she's a different person now. She has no remorse about our relationship ending. I'm trying to stop feeling sorry for myself at this point and just focus on myself. I don't want to associate myself with her anymore, she's not the person I grew up with. You start feeling good about where you're at in life and suddenly you don't love a person anymore. 8 years, and right before we were about settle down, she bailed. What the actual fuck. \n\nI would appreciate any advice reddit has to offer.

Know your worth. Stop trying so hard to prove yourself to someone else that you stop considering whether that person is worth YOUR time. Choose someone that respects your time, and prioritizes you over their friends, video games, etc. Don't waste your time eating up the things they say. Their actions tell you everything. And even if they end up being the one to break up with you, despite how hard you worked to treat them well and make things work, thank them for setting you free.\n2. If someone isn't ready for a relationship or not looking for one. Move on. You're not going to change their mind or convince them, and trying to do so is disrespectful to them AND yourself. Every interaction will give you hope, and your time is worth something real. You can't have something real if you're still hanging on to something that isn't.\n3. Once trust is broken, it's broken- break up once, shame on them. break up twice, shame on me. break up three times..., okay, maybe the previous times didn't stick but that's okay because you're learning now and you're not ever going back. Depression, difficult times, we all have them. You want a partner that can be vulnerable and brave enough to let you in and lean on you, not someone that pushes you away. You want someone that knows, that above all, they want you. Communication is everything. ***Any two people can make it work if both are willing to look inside themselves and do the work.*** If someone says they can't be the partner you deserve\/you deserve better, BELIEVE THEM- it's not flattery, it's manipulation and it's how they absolve themselves of any guilt. They are telling you they are not interested in doing the work it takes to make this relationship work. Let me repeat that: **They are telling you they are not interested in doing the internal or external work it takes to make this relationship work.** Let them go. \n\nAdditional points:\n\n1. Life will only get **harder** and you need a relationship that makes you feel like you can take on the world, not like the world is crushing you. You and your partner are taking on the world together. You don't have time to be worrying about whether or not they even care about you.\n2. No matter what, don't let them make you bitter. Stay soft. It's brave, and it's extremely difficult. You're walking away with an opportunity to develop an even deeper capacity to love. That means a more joyful, fulfilling, enriched life, either with yourself and friends\/family, and or with a significant other. \n3. You didn't LOSE anything. You made space for something better.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678560046.0},{"title":"Saw someone I use to talk to at a party","author":"SignificantDesk7605","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/BreakUps\/comments\/11pcueh\/saw_someone_i_use_to_talk_to_at_a_party\/","text":"I use to talk to this kid (let\u2019s call him Matt) for about a year.

We have been together for almost 5 years now and I'm not sure about our relationship anymore. I am finding it very difficult to break up with him because I have no support systems in my life other than him and he has been with me through thick and thin, but I am not sure staying in this relationship is healthy for both of us. It's like I grew up and changed myself for him (yes, for the better), but he is still the teenager I started dating 5 years ago (but worse). \n\nNot only when speaking to me, but also to his parents, he is always angry and irritated. When we go out, he never looks like he's enjoying himself. He always asks me to plan dates, and when I say that I don't mind where we go (because I literally don't, I'm happy to go anywhere) he gets angry with me because he says I don't show any interest. He wants me to plan every detail of our date.\n\nI feel that he is starting to act like a child, and because of this I don't even want to be intimate with him anymore, and because of this he gets more frustrated and says that all he does is wrong (playing the victim card, as always).\n\nI also feel as if he doesn't prioritise me; his life is all about the gym and his bros, and I'm just there for when the other things aren't available.We usually only meet up on Saturday and occasionally on a Sunday, and even when we meet up I feel like he is there with me because I want to meet up, or to have sex, and not actually because he enjoys my company.\n\nTo be honest, I may be a difficult partner to have,l a relationship with because I do have my own issues (anxiety, anxious attachment disorder, and so on), but I am really tired of this attitude. I don't even look forward to hang out with him anymore and everytime we actually do hang out we always end up frustrated with each other.\n\nI would like to fix this situation, but if I talk to him he thinks I'm attacking him and we end up fighting.

I've been hanging out w a couple of my friends that are in relationships, and the way they act around their significant others is so different. and then it hit me, that my relationship wasn't as ideal or as good as I thought at all.\n\nshe would constantly make fun of my interests and thought they were embarrassing (completely harmless things by the way, stuff like playing my fav videogames or listening to my favorite kinda music that apparently was really Really cringe), so I could never talk about hobbies and things interesting me. and she had the audacity to complain that I barely start conversations, when I know everyhting I'll say will be made fun of. \n\nshe'd hurt me saying things like how I'm a bad kisser, how when we kissed for the first time she didn't even feel a spark, how I can't even take initiative or be dominant in this relationship and \"be a man\" (I'd never dated anyone before her, and within the first month we only got to meet up very few times, I didn't know how to kiss people yet! plus she knew me very well beforehand and she Knew I'm not the dominant type at all).\n\nshe had so many demands to the point where when we hung out or went on dates I couldn't act the way I wanted but I felt like I had to perform so she could keep loving me. \n\n she was also obsessed w the idea of me being\/acting like a straight man even though I'm bisexual(which again, she knew very well) , and to her, the idea of me being into men too and \"replacing her with a man\" if we ever broke up disgusted her. me being a Little bit feminine and less dominant was an \"ick\" apparently.

I let her rant all the time, though. I thought I was being a nice bf and respecting her boundaries about me not telling her about my problems. \n\nit was suffocating, I could never talk about my problems and I was constantly tense and trying not to say the wrong thing. There were a couple occasions on which she listed off things that bothered her about my behavior. I always said \"I love you so I'll try to change those for the sake of our relationship\" and called it healthy communication. I was really stupid. I started changing jsut to be the perfect guy for her and lost all sense of self in the process.\n\n I convinced myself I was straight, I convinced myself this was the relationship I wanted and that I'm so in love with her none of this bothers  me and we'll communicate our way out of it (bcs we're a healthy couple ofc).

I was a devoted partner, I communicated my concerns, I went above and beyond to learn my partner\u2019s likes and dislikes, supported them through tough times. I also never batted an eye at some sacrifices I had to made for our relationship to thrive. \n\nBut two months in is where I saw myself shift. It was because, I presume, my decisions were questioned in way that made me feel ashamed\/inadequate. The reactions to my decisions\/opinions changed as well, often they would be more bitter, angry, and even passive aggressive until I gave in once to avoid potential conflict. After that this happened every argument (even over small ones) and I think I just conditioned myself to not argue as much and give in easily due to shame. It got so bad that I would watch what I said and what I did carefully as to not make them sad and disappointed since small mistakes were taken as a malicious intent. There instances when my taste in friends and the company I like to keep were questioned and I even contemplated removing life long friends from my life, past the ones I was made to remove since they \u2018hurt the relationship or might later on.\u2019 \n\nIn the end the pressure to be perfect and lack of trust\/privacy built up and boiled over until I couldn\u2019t handle it and I suggested we should end things out of the blue via text, I was afraid of the reaction.

For being cold after the break up and for being an all out bad partner that may have given them a trust issue\/trauma. \n\nI want to gain nothing from this except the fact I\u2019m working to amend myself and this requires I do something to be held accountable for my actions.

Please share your thoughts!","author":"Free-Bowler-7966","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/BreakUps\/comments\/11opztl\/was_i_emotionally_abused_please_share_your\/","text":"I apologize in advance for the lengthy post and I don't mean in any way to downsize the volume of abuse that people in this community might have sadly gone through. I don't believe that I have had the most abusive relationship, but I'm starting to wonder if I was being emotionally manipulated and whether I was with a narcissistic person.\n\nI broke up with my partner 2 months ago. We had a 3-year long relationship. Even though I was the one to break up with him, I have always questioned myself and whether I was the one to ruin everything.\n\nUp until I met up with a close friend of mine few weeks ago and I vented (in detail) about the relationship, she was utterly shocked that I didn't leave earlier and she suspected that I was being emotionally abused and even called him a narcissist. Ever since, I have been thinking nonstop and very surprised that was I in fact being abused? and that it was so strong to the point that I have never seen it until someone said it?\n\nThe following are things that happened to brief you about the relationship:\n\n1. He never saw himself as someone who does anything wrong: it is always my fault. He never apologized. He actually believed that he is someone too sweet and kind to do me wrong (he said that on multiple occasions).\n2. I always get punished for my feelings: whenever I point out anything bothering me, he always blames me for being \"negative and too emotional\" and that I'm taking so much out of his energy. He even told me once that his comfort and happiness is above everything and that he will never consider marrying me if it meant that we'll be having arguments. He actually believed that a healthy relationship is free from arguments, even small ones. I can't even count the times I cried myself to sleep because he decided to ignore me after expressing my feelings about something.\n3. He was really good in making me question myself: 95% of the times I ALWAYS came back apologizing, even though he did something that annoyed me. An example: I once expressed to him (in an extremely nice and loving way) that I feel a bit pressured that I have to share extremely little things about my life (like texting him I'm leaving from work the moment I do), and he absolutely lashed out at me and punished me for expressing my feelings by ignoring me ALL day and ignoring my texts and calls. After I got all upset with his reaction, he eventually convinced me that I don't share my life with him like I'm supposed to (even though that's VERY far from the truth), but yet again he convinced me.\n4. He becomes irritated whenever my attention is on other people: my close friends did a small gathering at their house to celebrate my birthday (which came the following day). He used to work in another country and that night of the gathering happened to be the last night he would be in his apartment (which he loved so much) because he was going to go back to his home country (where I am). He made a HUGE argument about the fact that I prioritized my friends over him and wasn't there for him when he needed me, since he was so emotional about leaving his apartment. Another incident is when my best friend who I haven't seen for a year came to visit me, he was down with the flu at that time. I of course checked on him before my friend arrived because I knew that I would be busy chatting with her. He eventually lashed out at me and made me feel like the WORST girlfriend in the world for not checking my phone when I was with my friend, and not checking on him. I can honestly say that I don't remember a time where I was out with my friends and he didn't make a big deal out of something.\n\nPlease don't get me wrong, I wasn't an angel and I was full of flaws, BUT I have always acknowledged my mistakes, apologized, and put effort in being a better partner. And one thing I'm very sure of is the fact that I gave way more than I received in the relationship. He was EXTREMELY good with words and making me feel loved, but not with actions. I stood up for him in the worst situations and supported him emotionally and financially throughout the relationship and at some point I prioritized his needs in critical times of my life where I needed support the most.\n\nThe last 5 months of our relationship were the worst because I couldn't take it anymore and I was so tired of the fact that I'm putting up with so many things yet he still refuses to do something as little as apologizing to me whenever he annoys me, and that his ego is making him actually believe that he is an angel and doesn't do anything wrong.\n\nI don't remember a time in my relationship with this guy where I didn't feel like I'm a burden on him or a bad girlfriend. It was a continuous feeling for me. On our last day as a couple when things heated off, he called me the \"meanest girlfriend alive\" and refused to listen to me when I told him that I needed him to hear me out or otherwise our relationship cannot continue. He refused to hear me out and I broke up with him while still doubting myself and that I should've done better, but now I'm having conflicting thoughts and that I might have been manipulated by him.\n\nSorry again for the long post and I would really appreciate your thoughts on this.","upvote_ratio":0.84,"created_utc":1678556277.0},{"title":"Does anyone ever really break up to work on themselves?","author":"Hedgehog8964","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/BreakUps\/comments\/11onbyq\/does_anyone_ever_really_break_up_to_work_on\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678549593.0},{"title":"Things left unsaid","author":"Silver_Bow","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/BreakUps\/comments\/11ox7oh\/things_left_unsaid\/","text":"So I keep going back and forth on how I feel about this whole thing.

She broke up with me in person, but didn't tell me everything. Last time I saw her in person, she gave me less than 5 minutes to talk. What she tells me in person and what she tells me through text are completely different. She lied to me and about me, and didn't want to take responsibility for anything that she did wrong, and would push all her issues and what she did onto me, deflecting any of the blame onto me to me look and feel like the bad guy.\n\nI told her off and blocked her on everything almost a month ago, but the issue is that I still constantly think about her. Every time I think about her I get pissed off. There is so much that I want to say to her, but I can't. I know there is a lot unsaid from both of us, but she won't be mature enough to talk to me in person. I refuse to unblock her on anything unless she comes to me first, but it's hard just keeping all of this to myself. I know that she will always be on my mind, because I constantly think of people from my past, whether it's ex-partners, ex-friends, or even ex-coworkers.

Bob and my former lover we\u2019re close friends before we started talking.

Soon they were hanging out so much like every week. She would take days instead of minutes to respond back. Another red flag I ignored that I should of fucking ended or not pursued the relationship further was that when she dating her ex, she cheated on him with another dude from another country and they sexted back and forth. So anyways, I confronted her about this dilemma and she told me well if you\u2019re not gonna trust me I\u2019m gonna block you. She did. I was heartbroken and angry. Fast forward to today. She unblocked me to ask how I was doing. Me being polite I said everything is ok and I said what about you? And she said oh everything is going fine me and Bob like each other now.

My husband had suggested I see if he was interested. It started from there and it was a lot of fun and exciting. My coworker only speaks Spanish so flirting was new and different. To ease things since he seemed nervous going straight into joining us, my husband wanted just us to see if we felt comfortable together.  He was very eager with me with I really enjoyed but when it came to seeing if he wanted to join me and my husband it just kinda didn\u2019t go anywhere.  Husband asked if we could just end it at that since nothing was happening. But at that point I was hooked and throughly enjoyed sleeping with my coworker and I wasn\u2019t ready to let that go. On my coworkers end it seemed like he was interested in continuing. This is where 2 month long affair started, I couldn\u2019t get enough of it. Yes I felt\/feel guilty but that\u2019s the choice I made. But then one day my coworker told me he just couldn\u2019t keep doing this anymore. He was worried about my husband finding out what we had been doing and didn\u2019t want anything to happen. \n\nAs it was happening I knew deep down this was going to end eventually but I just wasn\u2019t ready and pretty caught off guard since we had just been flirting the other day.

I know it\u2019s not the absolute best thing to do, but I don\u2019t do it a ton and it doesn\u2019t consume me or anything and is out of just pure curiosity.\n\nSo last night maybe a couple hours after posting my original post on here, I checked to see his activity. At the time he was active on messenger but on instagram it said he was active over an hour ago. So I know he\u2019s at least on his phone. I just go about my business back to scrolling on insta as usual and I come across a post that I wanna repost on my story. It wasn\u2019t anything cryptic or relationship related. \n\n(I\u2019m autistic and ever since I was diagnosed over a year ago, I\u2019ve wanted to bring a lot of awareness to the disorder and be an advocate so I often repost thing on my story from autistic content creators I follow.)\n\nSo I repost it on my story. Still on insta, I go to look through the chats to respond to a friend\u2019s message, and I scroll past my ex\u2019s convo. All of a sudden it says \u201cactive now\u201d. Keep in mind this is RIGHT AFTER I posted on my story. I thought that was a super weird coincidence and got to thinking about things. I wondered if having post notifications on Instagram was a thing, and I found out it was. I laughed to myself and wondered if he had them on for my stories. \n\nI then decided to check my story viewers since I normally do that the first few minutes I post something just to see which people are gonna view it first out of curiosity. (I don\u2019t post often at all really, so that\u2019s why I like looking at that stuff). I only had 2 viewers for the first couple minutes, then it jumped to 4. And I thought to myself, \u201coh cool, I wonder who the other two are now\u2026wouldn\u2019t it be funny if one of them was him?\u201d AND LO AND BEHOLD one of them is indeed my ex. The post was only up for 3, maybe 4 minutes at this point, and he was the 4th person to view it. That made me laugh even harder. \n\nSo I mean, sure it could\u2019ve been a coincidence that he became active on Instagram right after I posted something, but it\u2019s definitely NOT a coincidence that he viewed it as early as he did. Like YOU chose to click on that yourself dude.

I know that everyone is going to tell me no, but I will explain my thoughts anyway.\n\nFor context, me (F21) and my now ex (M21) broke up last night. We\u2019ve been together for two years, known each other for 3 1\/2. We met the first day of college and started dating in my sophomore year. Fast forward to now, we\u2019re seniors about to graduate this May. He\u2019s somewhat emotionally unavailable. He witnessed a really nasty divorce in high school and admits that it affects the way he forms relationships.\n\nAlso important to note, we broke up in January for about two days. He broke up with me, and I called him two days later because it didn\u2019t quite feel right, mainly because he said he still loved me and it was the second time I had ever witnessed him cry. He gave it some thought and we got back together. I felt anxious most of the time we were back together just because of how hard I took the initial break up.\n\nNow, we broke up last night. We haven\u2019t had\u2026well\u2026 in a couple of months so I thought I\u2019d ask him if he was interested in doing that last night. This led to a convo where he said that he feels that this is more of a friendship than a relationship. He\u2019s still attracted to me, he just doesn\u2019t really have any urges to be intimate with me. He often doesn\u2019t even kiss me.\n\nMy heartbroken brain wants to call him in a few days, half joking, and say \u201chey, I\u2019ve heard you\u2019re single now, want to go out on a date with me?\u201d\n\nOf course, a part of me hopes that the two of us can fall back in love and all that, but the bigger reason is that I don\u2019t want to go through these next two months without him in my life. I want to live our lives to the fullest while we still can, and after graduation, we go our separate ways. \n\nI know that this is probably a terrible idea. In fact, I\u2019m almost 100% certain he\u2019d say no, but I almost want to laugh about it in a few years when all of this is a distant memory. I wouldn\u2019t be expecting us to go back to what we used to be, or to start talking about marriage like we once used to, but I just want to be with him until I don\u2019t have to worry about running into him or until I know that we\u2019ve absolutely done everything offered to us.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678582079.0},{"title":"Fourth time is the charm?","author":"bubblegrungevirgo","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/BreakUps\/comments\/11oumv9\/fourth_time_is_the_charm\/","text":"For clarification, my bf and I are actually together right now, but things aren\u2019t exactly going well.

Really not long at all but without trying to sound corny, I would consider this girl my first true love. We were super tight and she said I was her first real love too.

She had a hard time expressing emotions and feelings but she was a great gf for the most part. I would consider her an avoid-attachment style.

I was trying to be there for her and be patient but she was treating me like dirt and blatantly disrespecting me.

I have been feeling the friendship has been one sided for a long time now and its mostly been me reaching out to them. \n\nIt's got to a point where I'm feeling hurt almost everyday and if I bring attention up about it they turn it against me and make me feel guilty for talking about it. \n\nWhen I'm not around them or trying to talk to them I feel hurt for a few days, but then I feel happy, but when I reach back out to them I feel hurt and miserable again. \n\nSo I'm asking if I should end the friendship over these thing. I'm usually not the one to end friendships with people as I usually get worried I will hurt them or things will get better eventually.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1678566769.0},{"title":"Feeling Torn","author":"music_sports_guy","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/BreakUps\/comments\/11oonr1\/feeling_torn\/","text":"I joined this subreddit a while ago cause something in my soul was telling me peoples stories and advice would help if I ever needed it. \n\nI\u2019m hurt, I\u2019m torn, I\u2019m devastated - I fell in love with someone, madly in love. I poured my heart, soul and my all into her. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever poured myself into someone as I did her. Her and I had the same end goals, were wanting to accomplish and build a life together. \n\nA few weeks back she asked for space but we\u2019d still talk. Her reasons behind her needing to be single didn\u2019t make sense to me cause they were things that were easily solvable with your partner.\n\nLast night - she dropped the hammer on me. She told me she\u2019s been in love with her ex - for the past 4-5 months. He was her first love and was the only person there for her when she was at a low point in her life. She thought she was over him but as soon as she saw him again, those feelings came back. I understand that people don\u2019t forget their first loves. Hell, there have been times where an ex of mine comes to mind but they\u2019re fleeting. \n\nIt hurts that she was telling me how her intuition tells her that she\u2019d never close the door on him and she feels he\u2019s her person- even though he\u2019s already seeing someone else, she hopes he reaches back out.\n\nAnyways, that hurt but I think what hurts the most is that she strung me along. We spent Valentine\u2019s Day together, went on vacation, spent time with my family, built bonds with my kids and STILL was trying to make long term plans while knowing she was in love with her ex. It would\u2019ve been an easier pill for me to swallow if she came out and said it as soon as she realized that she loved him but she didn\u2019t cause she hoped she would\u2019ve been able to move on and be with me.\n\nI guess if anyone has been through this situation, what are some ways you all did or some advice to let go of the pain and be in peace knowing that it really wasn\u2019t me not worth it?","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678552942.0},{"title":"Still not over the breakup after 7 months","author":"disguisedweirdo","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/BreakUps\/comments\/11oi13q\/still_not_over_the_breakup_after_7_months\/","text":"Hey everyone,\nI\u2019m 22 and got dumped by my girlfriend of 3.5 years last summer. We got together senior year in Highschool and had a great relationship. It was one of those relationships where people thought it would never end and so did I. Even though we were fairly young when we got together, our relationship was pretty mature. We never had irrational fights, nobody cheated etc. When something was wrong we would sit down and talk about it and figure out a solution for the problem. \nSince we were together for a long time and started to sort of become adults we also talked about the future. We had similar expectations, visions and goals for our future. \nOne day, without warning, she dumped me for no particular reason. She said some bs like \u201cIt\u2019s me, you\u2019re great\u201d or \u201cI just can\u2019t commit to a serious relationship right know\u201d. \nMy world was shattered from one day to another. To me everything seemed to go great as usual. We were still talking all the time. I would still come up with ideas for romantic dates etc. I always tried to \u201ckeep the magic alive\u201d, as some say. \nI wanted to marry that girl and she knew that. I just wanted to wait until I got my engineering degree and had a full time job, so I can provide for us. She always said that if I would propose she would say yes immediately. \n\nTo sum it up: To this day I still can\u2019t really understand or comprehend why she ended it. She also said that she still loves me and always will. But why did she break up then? I\u2019m still hung up on this question. I\u2019m doing better now than I was a few months ago but I begin to think that I will never get over her. Since the breakup I\u2019ve had the casual one night stand and have been around other women in general but I just can\u2019t get her out of my head completely. Is this normal?\n\n*PS: Sorry for my grammar, English isn\u2019t my first language.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678534699.0},{"title":"Whose gone back to a relationship ?","author":"Darkdestroyer4","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/BreakUps\/comments\/11otxex\/whose_gone_back_to_a_relationship\/","text":"I have a genuine belief that women never come back , so I just wanna see\n\n[View Poll](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/poll\/11otxex)","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678565852.0},{"title":"Divorce immediately after marriage","author":"ThrowRA_Kenny","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/BreakUps\/comments\/11oochi\/divorce_immediately_after_marriage\/","text":"Me (29M) and my wife (28F) married at the end of last year after 6 years of healthy and loving relationship. We had our ups and downs but our views on major values, hobbies and passions aligned.  We had many good memories and fun days\/nights together. \n\nNo emotional, physical abuse, alcohol use or any other similar things were present during relationship. Please note that several traumatic events happened in her life and she was under a lot of stress a work during 2022. I was trying my best to support her, but perhaps she expected different kind of support. \n\nSeveral months after the wedding wife separated and asked to divorce me stating that she does not love me anymore and was dead inside\/lonely for a while, even during our wedding. That I am not the right person to meet her needs. Even my friends are saying that whatever I say (especially positive words), she is turning to a negative perspective. In addition, some facts are changed to fit this divorce narrative or even stating that we were \"rebound\" relationship in a way. \n\nBeing separated for several months, she is stating that she feels alive again and she is enjoying life. Yet when I ask her if she is happy, the answer is no. She has been threatening to divorce several times now, but has not taken any real action (file papers, hire lawyers, sell our assets or take her things). She is not willing to try, go to therapy or do anything to save the relationship. \n\nI've read through many topics in reddit where divorce happened in less than a year and most of those stories had some sort of critical event - infidelity, abuse or addiction. There are no financial or other benefit to gain from marrying and divorcing. Many people have stated that this could be due to infidelity but she is saying that there is no other man. I believe her. I am truly devastated, lost and deeply looking for an answer what happened... At this point, I am indecisive if I should continue fighting for us or start moving on. \n\nPerhaps anyone have a similar story and could share it? Did you end up back together or divorced? \n\nAny other ideas on what could be happening\/how should I react would be truly appreciated. \n\nThank you, god bless you!","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678552152.0},{"title":"I\u2019m completely co-dependant","author":"cuge_hunt","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/BreakUps\/comments\/11ohtyd\/im_completely_codependant\/","text":"So me and my partner split up three weeks ago now, and I\u2019ve completely fell back to my old self.\n\nI\u2019m drinking to much, I\u2019m bad to just being a horrible person.
