Or how contradictory his feelings about Dublin were. It's really humanising. \n\n(Sorry I'm too lazy to type it out or OCR it)\n\nDubliners was my first Joyce book ever and it has been immensely special to me ever since I read it when I was 18. One of my favourite short story collection for sure. \n\nAnyway, enjoy!",
