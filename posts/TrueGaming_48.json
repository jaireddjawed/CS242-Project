        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/7ka6mk/why_is_resident_evil_1_seen_as_a_classic/",
        "text": "A lot of people say Resident Evil 1 is a classic, one of the best games ever made. They love it for its atmosphere and gameplay. So when I noticed that I owned the Remastered version of it on Steam (kinda forgot I got it from a Humble Bundle), I immediately started playing. After about 6 hours of playing it, I quit the game and don't intend on starting it up again.  \nI don't wanna sound like an ass (even though the title of this post is kinda awful, sorry about that), but I genuinely don't get why people praise the game as much as they do. The camera system with its multiple angle seemed like a nice idea at the beginning of the game, but quickly became tedious and annoying. A lot of the gameplay involves running from a storage crate to a room with a puzzle because you didn't have the one item you need to solve it with you, when you first found the puzzle. The survival aspect isn't really that prevalent, as healing items and ammo can be found quite often. And the inventory system is just the worst part of it all. The amount of backtracking you have to do because you found an important item, but can't take it with you because your inventory is full, is absurd.  \nAgain, I don't want to sound like an asshole who just ignorantly rambles on about how bad this game is and how stupid every person, that actually likes it, is. There were some things that I actually enjoyed: The \"random\" moments/events in the game are just awesome! There were a few times, when I was walking through a hallway for the second or third time, when all of a sudden a nearby window broke and four zombies just marched in and all of a sudden, music set in. Those moments scared the shit out of me! The general contrast between silence and tension is incredibly well done. A lot of areas is the game do note feature music at all, while others feature eerie background music. This is especially prevalent, when you first enter a new part of the mansion. You see the animation of a door opening, creepy music starts playing and you hear the growl of a zombie, thats somewhere nearby.  \nWith that being said, the gameplay is so awful that I feel like it absolutely overshadows the positive aspects of the game. Is it because I stopped playing after a few hours? Am I missing something here?  \nWhat do all of you think? Why do you enjoy the game (or not)? Because I've been listening to the save room music for the last 20 minutes (which is by far the best thing in the game) and just can't figure out, why this game is seen as a classic.  \n\nEdit: Just a quick edit to thank all of you for your comments! Didn't really expect so many answers, especially so many well thought out ones! Learned quite a few interesting things about RE1, that put a few of the problems I have with the game in pespective. I guess considering whatlimitations they had to work around when making the game, it actually is kind of impressive what they were able to achieve.\n",

        "text": "To be more specific in case my title didn't make it clear (not sure the exact term for these kind of systems), but essentially these are games where the progression of your characters abilities lies on the repeated use of those particular skills. Say in an Elder Scrolls game, if you want your 1 handed blade skill to go up, you accomplish this by attacking with a 1 handed blade over and over again.  \n\nThe thing about it is, what is the advantage of using this kind of system over one where you just gain normal experience and distributing it on skills you want your character to be good in. The main defense I see is it's immersion breaking because you can make a character who has never swung a sword be a master swordsman or something along those lines. The problem is it's just not interesting to level up skills in these ways. It encourages repetition beyond normal repetition in rpgs which just serves to make an unfun game (personal opinion of course, but one I'll stand by). So you'll get stupid things like people just healing themselves over and over in Oblivion or something along those lines. \n\nThe only way I can see it working is in a game where the enemies are both limited and do not respawn on death. So for example, RogueLikes, Fire Emblem (older entries and Conquest), Breath of Fire V could've all used this system. That way you had to actually plan on which skills you were going to use and level up within each battle, and it would put a little more weight on those choices. But for a normal rpg I think these systems should be refrained personally. ",

        "text": "The standard way to beat hard games is to just play the same level over and over again until you have memorized it in order to beat it. To make this not possible the level should change randomly each time you play it. This would also have the effect of increasing the replay value of the game as well. Usually when randomness is added to games it is usually to much randomness like the case of procedurally generated games or not enough randomness like the case where the level is exactly the same every time you play it. A moderate amount of randomness could make things interesting too. Some games could even be remade (such as smb3) with a moderate amount of randomness added to each level. It's also possible this could make the game too hard so games with randomly changing levels may have to be made easier. Just so you know I got this idea from the first try or skip (fan created mode) in mario maker. People sometimes did this challenge in expert 100 man but considered it too difficult for super expert",

        "text": "I remember playing FFX for the first time and although it’s quite a linear experience, the game has many sections throughout the world that can be explored and revisited and I always thought that it was massive (the Calm Lands) and very cool. \n\nBethesda taught me what a real open world game is all about with a large map, hundreds of tangible items, dialogue choices and NPCs that offered side quests in Fallout 3 and Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion. I truly fell in love with these games and their settings. Ever since then it feels like developers continually try to outdo themselves and others and promote their game as “the biggest open world we have ever created.” \n\nI recently played Assassins Creed Origins and that honestly had me in disbelief, the world is huge! And now I’m hearing that Far Cry 5 is equally as big from people in the industry with early hands-on game time.\nMy question is how big is too big? It’s gotten to the point that when I open up a map and see an immense unexplored space I actually feel dread. The amount of time it will take to traverse it all and see everything I want to see takes a real time commitment and for me, works against the game and takes away a little bit of enjoyment. I want to feel like I am actually making progress when exploring and it’s daunting after spending hours in a single area can look insignificant when zoomed out. \n\nI wanted to find out if others feel this way. What games do you think nailed the size and scope of an open world map? And what in-game activities provide the best open world experience and gives life to this type of game? ",

        "text": "During a discussion with a friend, I've realized I've never fallen in love in a specific game's skill tree (or general RPG elements for that matter). Declaring a specific skill tree as 'perfect' or the best is subjective, stemming from people's varying opinions on certain aspects. Are you okay with skill trees that allow you to obtain all the skills (or almost all of them) like *Wolfenstein*? Do you like Wolfenstein's way of acquiring those skills, or do you prefer skill points, or continuous usage like in *Skyrim*? Personally, I strongly dislike Skyrim's skill tree, because I think it doesn't reward people for getting out of their comfort zone and being creative and versatile. Sure, total mastery can be achieved but it's a total grind, which I'm also not a fan of. Even in games meant to be played for long, I don't like doing chores. Another one I'm not highly fond of, dispite being a big fan of the game, is **The Witcher 3**. It lacks depth and freedom, IMO. TW3 is one of my favorite RPGs while lacking in some of the core RPG elements, and I find it funny\nMy favorite ones are probably **Diablo 3** and **Bastion**. Yeah, Bastion; looking at all of its game mechanics as a whole. From the armory and the individual customization (and the way you acquire the upgrades) to the distillery, to the shrine that increases the difficulty creatively, and not just with numbers.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/7k2rlv/xenoblade_chronicles_2_a_case_study_on_how/",
        "text": "Let me start by saying that Xenoblade Chronicles 1 has to be one of my favorite JRPGs of all time, to the point where I bought a physical copy of the Wii game without having a Wii. Although I had trepidations about the direction of Xenoblade Chronicles 2 (XC2), I bought the game and am currently about 15 hours into it. In my playthrough, there have been a bevy of issues that have become increasingly difficult to ignore, to the point where I think they deserve calling out.\n\nBefore I say what those issues are, there are two counter-arguments I'd like to address right off the bat, especially given the \"low\" time investment I currently have in the game. In response to \"These problems have existed in the last two iterations of XC and are more quirks of the series\", I want to point out that the issues I present can still be considered issues; many details are changed in between each game, and I wanted to point out how a legacy 'quirk' can transform into a bigger problem in light of those changes. In response to the point of \"some of these issues get better later on in the game or are fixed\", I'd like to  say that if a problem persists for 15+ hours in a game, I think it still deserves to be labeled as a problem for the sheer amount of time it persists.\n\nMy goal in this post is to present to overarching facets of the game, and show you how little problems build up to create big systems that not only stumble occasionally (which can be forgivable), but stumble too frequently to ignore.\n\n**[Exploration]**\nAn iconic tenet of the Xenoblade Chronicles is the sheer size of the world and setting. There is always something new to explore; either in terms of mechanics, or places, or people, or new things to do entirely. Unfortunately, Xenoblade Chronicles 2 suffers from a stifling barrier of opacity, making exploring new things either confusing or more potentially difficult than necessary.\n\n- Combat tutorials are explained once, in text format, and _never mentioned again_. There is no way to revisit a tutorial once it has been presented, so if you accidentally press A and skip one page of the tutorial, __that information is permanently lost__.\n\n- The map system is useless. In a game with such a large explorable world, your only three maps are a tiny minimap which only highlights active enemies and quest-required interactive NPCs/items, an obnoxious and slightly larger minimap blown up to the size of your screen, and the fast travel map, which must be navigated to via submenus. There is no way to mark places of interest. There is no way to see where all of your quests will take you; you can only see the one \"active\" quest and the main story quest.\n\n- The distribution of monsters and monster levels on any given map are done in such a way that it becomes impossible to free-explore. Monsters from levels 2 through 80 are placed in the same area. In an ideal world, the sheer quantities of areas of high level creatures encourages a player to mark each location as \"I'll visit here later\". The truth is that the placement actually forces you to travel through open terrain in \"lanes\". Any deviation from the lane causes you to encounter enemies significantly higher than you and easily capable of one-shotting you. This problem is apparent at the very start of the game. At some point around you being level 5, you start on top of a hill and you're supposed to head to a town on the opposite end of an open plain. If you do not walk a straight line from the top of the hill to the town, you will encounter enemies 10 levels higher than you. And I mean a straight line; if you take the straightest route from point A to B, you _will_ see enemies twice your level to your left and right just by panning the camera. Also, did I forget to mention that in the middle of this route, a level 80 gorilla walks by occasionally and there's nothing you can do to get around it, except wait for it to walk by? Did I also forget to mention that there are level 18 and level 70 birds circling the sky who will fight you if you eye them the wrong way?\n\n- One of the core mechanics, salvaging, requires you to roll the dice with death consistently. Salvaging is an unnecessary quick-time-event minigame where you press buttons correctly to increase your chances of gathering a higher quality assortment of loot. Unfortunately, salvaging will _always_ summon a monster with it first, that you must kill if you are to open any chests that appear. The problem is, there is absolutely no way to tell the level of the creature that will appear except to start salvaging. If you get unlucky, you encounter a high level creature that kills you, and now have to start over from a pre-set checkpoint. Even worse is that because enemies in the world patrol and walk around, if you take too long to kill the chest-guarding enemy, there is a strong chance a patrol group of enemies will also join the fray.\n\n- Nearly all item acquisition is locked behind some arbitrary barrier of RNG and rarity values. Do you want new powerful Blades? You have to open a 1-item lootbox for a random chance of a 1 to 5 star \"Blade\". I call this system lootbox-esque because the Blades themselves have _inherent star ratings, just like Japanese mobile gacha games._ These inherent star ratings strongly affect the Blade's growth and initial power. Quests frequently require items of uncommon or higher rarity, and the only way to get them is to farm through salvaging or collection points and praying you get lucky.\n\n- Items are presented to you with no explanation at all, or are explained well after you can first pick them up. Here is a list of item types I picked up before the tutorial appeared or for which an explanation never appeared, and keep in mind each of these items have a different use: Aux Cores, Core Chips, Compassion/Justice/Bravery Boosters, Pouch items, Overdrive materials, Collection Point items.\n\n- You have to pay to access to a glossary of terms in the game. Each town has an \"information vendor\". Except the vendor doesn't sell you anything except for a one-liner sentence explaining a term you might have forgotten. I'm not joking about this. It's also a fairly pricey endeavor at the beginning of the game.\n\n**[Menu Navigation]**\nXenoblade Chronicles 2 contains a complex number of ways to power up each of your characters, ranging from perks, to accessories, to skill upgrades, and Blade (aka your pokemon) management, where you do the same as above. In a game where you can easily spend a good chunk of time doing item and skill management, XC2's menu easily drags out the length of the process.\n\n- Opening menus and submenus is slow. There's a 1-2 second delay between you pressing the button to go to the main menu, and the screen fading to black, then fading into the menu. There is another half second delay between pressing the button to open a submenu, and then the submenu appearing. My guess is there's some backend graphics work being done, as none of the menu has any 3D elements in.\n\n- The fast travel system (which unfortunately doubles as your only overworld map) practically requires you to know the name of every location you're heading to before hand, because you cannot preview any map. This is particularly bad because Travel menu clearly has room for it; nearly 2/3rds of the screen is empty. Not only do you have to know the continent of your destination (which is understandable), but it also requires you to know exactly what section of the continent you're going to. For example, in the first real continent you visit, you spend a good chunk of time on a mountainous region with multiple levels of plateaus. This region is divided by the fast travel system as \"Upper Level - Left\" and \"Upper Level - Right\". How do you know which is which? Well ideally you'd be able to preview the maps of either region but you can't. If you select the wrong Upper Level, you have to check the map to figure out you're wrong, then have to press back and then go to the other.\n\n- The menu separates \"Character\" and \"Blade\" and seems to arbitrarily share or remove features between each menu. In the \"Blade\" menu there is a tab called \"Blade Management\", where you can preview blades and their stats. Except you can only have 3 blades maximum, but for some reason you cannot assign blades to characters in the \"Blade Management\" tab. You have to go the \"Character\" menu and go to \"Engage Blades\" which then takes you to a interface nearly identical to the one to \"Blade Management\". Now what if you want to manage your currently active Blades? Well in the \"Characters\" Menu, the menu seems to make a distinction between characters and blades, so you can only fast rotate through your characters OR fast rotate through your character's active blades. For some reason, you cannot quickly switch between your characters and their blades in one collective list.\n\n- The quest menu hides the objectives for each quest behind a submenu. When you open a quest in the menu, you'll see one or more large rounded translucent squares at the bottom of the screen. In order to view quest objectives, you have to highlight the square and then press A, which then reveals a list of the objectives....for that square . An odd design, especially given you could have easily condensed all the squares into a single submenu, or at gotten rid of them altogether.\n\n**[Audio]**\nThe audio of the game contains major missteps in terms of volume balance, synchronization, and diversity.\n\n- Enemies have one or two voice lines, and this problem is exacerbated by the sheer numbers of enemies, the frequency of voicelines being uttered, and how long battles can drag out. In an early example, you board an enemy battleship and either have to sneak by a mess hall or a barracks filled with enemy soldiers. If a patrol catches you as you're sneaking, they'll alert all soldiers in the room to your area. This scenario is easily winnable, but takes several minutes. In the meanwhile, you'll have to listen to 8+ enemies cycling between the same two lines over and over again, and the chances of 4 of them either reciting the same line simultaneously or rapidly in sequence approaches 100%, and it will happen multiple times in the course of the brawl.\n\n- There is seemingly no volume-balancing done whatsoever. Starting and finishing quests begins an unskippable animation and tune that seemingly drops the entire volume of the game to 20% of normal. A certain character named \"Gramps\" consistently has his voicelines softer than any other person speaking. Worst of all, in cutscenes where the music crescendos (a frequent occurence), the voicelines easily get drowned out by the music, to the point where I'm beginning to believe that there is an extremely faulty volume normalization going on between music and voice.\n\n- There are desync problems that occur between voice lines and actions in the game during heavy load. While sound effects seem to occur on cue, there is a major issue where in voicelines \"queue\" up because a character is in the middle of saying filler speech but also needs to say a line from a skill cast. This leads to incredibly wonky timings where a character will say a voice line nearly 2-3 seconds after their skill had gone off. You can easily see this without combat too; if you repeatedly attempt to jump with the player character, the \"jump grunt\" will delay up until the point where you won't hear the line until _after_ you begin the descent portion of the jump.\n\n**[Combat]** Xenoblade Chronicles 2 contains a berth of combat mechanics to juggle, from crowd controls, to seals, skill chains, elemental attacks, etc. In theory, the wide variety of tools at your disposal should empower you to find many different ways to dispatch your enemies in style. However, many small design choices and limitations make the system fairly clunky to use.\n\n- Enemy HP seems to be is balanced on the assumption that you will use every available mechanic at your disposal. While this seems to be okay at glance, the net result is that failing to use your combat tools doesn't reduce the chances of your victory, it just drags out the time until your success. This is particularly sinful because the game actively hides combat mechanics from you in the beginning, which means that there will be multiple times that a fight drags on for a really long time, and you sit around wondering if this is all you do for the rest of the game.\n\n- The combat system will actively spite you for moving at all, despite also wanting you to do so for positional-based attacks as well as dodging. This is a series of mistakes that ultimately culminates in encouraging you to stand still and take every attack with your face. Your skills are built up with auto-attacks. Auto-attacks themselves build up in three levels. If you use a skill right after an auto-attack, you empower the skill, with damage increasing based on what \"level\" of auto-attack you just performed. Except moving in any way resets your auto-attack animation and level. So not only does moving make you take longer to gain access skills, but it also makes sure any skill cast is weaker than it could have been. \"Moving\" also counts as being forcefully moved as well, so enemy crowd control effects are particularly disruptive.\n\n- Displacement skills (pushback and knockback) are common, and stack upon each other, which means if you get hit with multiple knockback effects (see: herds of the same enemy), you will get launched from the fight. Not only that, but displace far enough and you might be unfortunate enough to fall off an edge or draw the aggro of a neighboring group of enemies. Your enemies have significantly easier access to them since they don't have to respect the Crowd Control chain that player characters do in order to apply them, and even if you could knockback your enemies, that ultimately hurts you because you have to move. And moving is bad due to the points listed above.\n\n- Skill combos break upon target death and are not retained for use on other enemies. Given how long it takes to build up towards one. This just breaks up the flow very badly and is counterintuitive, given the fact that the rewards for skill combos are AOE finishers and battle-wide effects.\n\n- 7 years later from the original game; actively engaged flying enemies will still fly off of cliffs, and your AI-controlled teammates will jump after them to their deaths.\n\n------\nSo these are my current issues with the game. At its core, I mostly enjoy playing through Xenoblade Chronicles 2, but it also frustrates me that there are many places in which the game could easily have been made better. My conjecture is that the dev team were pressed for time, and did not have enough time or QA to touch up flaws in localization or from player feedback. In the end, I think it hurt them significantly.\n\nFor players and non-players of Xenoblade Chronicles alike, what are your thoughts?",

        "text": "I recently figured out the common thread in most of my favorite games: a sense of solitude and introversion. \n\nGames like Dark Souls, King's Field, Myst, Super Metroid, Tomb raider 1, Thief 1 and Eye of the Beholder are very different,  yet they appeal to me for the same reasons. It drops me into a world with very few elements of distraction and require me to figure things out in a solitary fashion. Introverted games are usually much slower and more deliberate in its design. Even an action filled title like Dark Souls seems to be more about being alone in a hostile world than about fighting and action itself.\n\nThese games also have very sparse amount of hand holding, which i think is a requirement for creating a truly isolationist atmosphere. When the game is too meta and following you around at every step, it is harder to be immersed. A lack of hand holding doesn't equal difficulty, it just means that you are alone in this world and nobody will figure things out for you. In the age of extensive focus group testing, this seems perhaps archaic to many, yet it usually elevates immersion to a high degree. \n\nThere are lots of exceptions of course, from The Witness to Rain World, yet it seems that games with an introvert approach to mechanics and world building seems to be increasingly rare, in general. Tomb Raider 1 vs Tomb Raider reboot is a good example of the development towards a more \"humanized\" design. The austerity of the first TR game would be a hard sell today, yet it was immensely popular in the 90s. Why were people more accepting of this type of experience before? Is solitude (horror games excluded) simply seen as an outdated aspect incompatible with the expectations of modern game design? ",

        "text": "I am fascinated by the idea that games can evoke emotions and experiences unique to the medium. So when I see one of these highly acclaimed narrative (walking simulator) experiences, I tend to pick them up. That said, I have yet to encounter one game in this genre that was worth my time and money and I'm baffled as to why they are so highly regarded. To name my gripes with a few: \n\nGone Home - Are you kidding me? You have real game reviewers saying that Gone Home is one of their favorite games of all time. It's bland young adult fiction at best.\n\nFirewatch - I was so disappointed in the end of this game. They could have done something really fascinating and out there with the setting but, nope. Honestly I think this game is so highly regarded because of the way it simulates loneliness and a girl actually taking interest in you and being flirty. I'm not kidding. \n\nWhat Remains of Edith Finch: God dammit I had high hopes for this game. It got so much praise! The narrative is okay, I guess... but have these reviewers never read a novel for god's sake? Or seen a good film? Good narrative has tension, rising action, fascinating characters, unpredictable twists. This game has none of that. Judged against other narrative games, it was good. Judged against other ways of experiencing story, like books or movies, it was bland garbage. Honestly, imagine any of these games as short stories. They wouldn't even begin to work, because there's nothing there. \n\nI know I'm in the minority here. I'm interested to see what you guys have to say. For the record, the games that has demonstrated what good narrative gaming can be best are Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons and Journey. Both had an emotional arc and drama similar to the best films and books, but could only have been achieved throuhg the medium of video games. \n\nEDIT: Why don't I proofread before I click post?\n\nEDIT 2: It seems a lot of y'all find this post lazy, and some of my comments lazy. This sub really doesn't like lazy, which I will try to respect. Let me respond to the criticism of my using the term \"overrated\". \n\nEDIT: Alright, settle down. The above comment, was a lazy way to come back at a comment calling me lazy. You don't care for lazy in this sub, and I'll try to respect that. \n\nI agree that *merely* calling something overrated is pretty weak criticism. Professional critics would probably be wise to strike the word from their vocabulary altogether. However, in the consumer context, overrated can mean that most consumers are being misled into a purchasing decision by overwhelmingly positive critical reception which may be wildly out of line with consumer tastes. When it happens over and over again with a particular genre, it may represent a bias among the types of people who tend to be critics/reviewers, and that's worth knowing. \n\nFor example, I once went to see a movie that got 98% on Rotten Tomatoes critic reviews, which ended up being laughably terrible. It was an overly serious film about an artsy Manhattan dweller and her obsession with her little dog. Why did it get such great reception? My guess is that most movie critics are educated urban dwellers who identify with the childless, affluent, Manhattan set and their narcissism. Moviegoer beware. \n\nIn the case of walking simulators, there is such a clear pattern of, what seems to me, mediocre work receiving glowing praise and adoration that I wonder if there isn't some inherent bias among game reviewers. My guess is that game reviewers are generally not liberal arts students, and any exposure to narrative or literary tropes in their preferred genre is genuinely novel to them. If that really is the case, it is worth knowing as a consumer. \n\nSo, I don't *know* if the genre is overrated, but it might be. It may be that I'm missing something which people are getting out of these games in large numbers that just doesn't click for me for whatever reason. That's what I'm curious to know and that's why I made this post. Thanks for reading. ",

He likes computers a lot and built one with the intention to game on it. But he kind of sucks at games. I got him a controller to make things easier for him, but it seems he hasn't been able to get into games so easily. Hobbies in general are hard for him to stick with.\n\nHe used to love driving and watching NASCAR, but he doesn't have a car anymore. Christmas is coming up, at first I thought maybe I could get him a racing wheel and pedal set up, but that's a bit beyond my budget. I also figured I should see if he can get into the games before we go full out with the racing wheel set up, as that would almost feel like getting him a gift of something he *hopefully* might like, if that makes sense. (just considering the scope of that gift, I wouldn't really want to do that.)\n\nBut I thought hey, maybe I could get him a racing game! If there are any good NASCAR games out, that would be cool. He used to also enjoy watching F1 from time to time and I have seen people saying good things about the F1 games.\n\nThe [Codemasters Bundle](https://www.humblebundle.com/games/codemasters-racing-2017) on Humble looks like it may be a good bet, with the $15USD tier at the bottom.\n\nIs F1 2016 casual gamer friendly? Any other titles you would recommend instead? I'm thinking more of a sim racer than an arcade one, as he likes cars in general. Thanks.\n\nMy dad would definitely probably enjoy a newer one so as to make nice use of his graphics card, and we could work together on optimizing it :) Also any one with online multiplayer is a bonus as he could potentially play with me and my brother online when we aren't over. (On that same note local multiplayer is a bonus as well)\n\nSome further discussion questions to keep this thread not just suggestion specific:\n\nAre racing games casual friendly? Do you feel it is a hard genre to get into?\n\nWhat are some exciting new features/trends you've seen in racing games recently? Any potential for the genre to push even further?\n\nThanks guys",

The consumption is continuously changing according to daily patterns, and each source (Coal, Biomass, Water, Sun, etc..) and technology responds and acts differently, so you need to create a strategy to combine all sources effectively.\n\nThis game is still in development, but now I am wondering if this mechanic that is rich and unique could be successfully applied in a MOBA game where players compete to achieve an efficient grid and connect clients to their power grid.\nI say the mechanic is rich because there are a lot of variables involved like the Coal Thermoelectric Powerplant is cheaper to run, is predictable but has a slow response time and is not renewable. \nThe sun photovoltaics tech is cheap but produces only during the day, is better in summer than in winter and does not help during the most challenging hours (the night peak).\n\nSince the most popular games in the MOBA genre are pure fantasy and almost all are about war(the other are mostly sports games) do you think that such unique gameplay could result in a successful niche game?\n\nIf you want to try the mechanics mentioned above, the version in progress can be played on the browser for free on itch.io [HERE](https://claudioa.itch.io/power-the-grid)\n\nWhat're your thoughts?

I had never played System Shock 2 before, but was a big fan of the Bioshock series, and this seemed like the closest thing to Bioshock 4. The huge interconnected levels, audiotapes, and post-apocalyptic setting are all awesome. \n\nBut as I've played on, I'm having a lot of struggles that I wasn't expecting. Perhaps Prey is a more demanding game than one would expect these days. But I find myself getting swamped with enemies, lacking bullets and resources, and seemingly out of materials to recycle for ammunition. I feel frustrated and like giving up. \n\nI decided instead to install a mod to allow for an infinite amount of ammo, eliminating a large chunk of the frustration. I was surprised, but since I've found myself absolutely loving the game. It's become more of an exploratory power fantasy, where I can pay more attention to the setting and story presented within as opposed to whether or not the alien down the hallway is going to spot me and eat my face. This obviously isn't the intended way of playing, but to me, it is preferable. \n\nDo you have any experiences of changing the genre or feel of a game with cheats code/mods? Is the 'experience' and accomplishment of completing a game cheapened by using console commands?",

Right now if you want to tell a story, movies are the way to do it as they allow you to get more of the creatives vision rather then books that rely only on verbal detail. This however will change in the near future with the advent of short, story based games like the beginners guide, as well as the longer ones like life is strange. \n\nGames like these are right now in a weird spot of being seen less like games and more like experiences to be had. The \"game\" is almost always advancing the plot or building the world around you such as what would happen as you progress through a movie. However unlike a movie, games like these provide their players a way to interact and be immersed in the world much more then any movie could ever dream of. This concept is similar to why many people like movies more then books. It allows them to get more out of the world they are experiencing. Rather then reading about the world they get to see it, and with games rather then just seeing the world they get to live in it. Games like life is strange offer choice to their players and allow them to experience the story their own way rather then they way of just someone else' vision.\n\nThis is not to say that movies will die, because they wont. There will always be people like me who will want them just like there will always be people who want books. However with the increase in the amounts of games like these, the (hopeful) advanced in VR tech, games like these will become more and more common place and more accepted as art in the sense that movies or books are and will become one of the primary ways, if not the most common way, for people to tell stories.\n",

I've always loved to spectate, cheer on competitors from the sidelines, and watch how effortlessly they've strung together their well timed flurries of kicks and punches. I say that so I don't come off as biased to many of you reading this. But the fact of the matter is that even though I am a huge fan of fighting games, I am terribly bad at them.\n\nMY STORY: (SKIP THIS IF YOU WANT)\n\nI've played an small list of fighting games, firstly dating back to when I firstly had Tekken on my PS1. After becoming ecstatic from the newly purchased game, I decided to do what many people would've as well and tried to get good at it. I placed myself against the computer eons and eons on end, preparing to destroy my older brother at a game he claimed I would never beat him in. After building the courage and confidence of knowledge, I finally challenged my brother to a match. My brother took the first win and I chalked it up to good luck and settled up again. The matches continued, I was getting slaughtered more and more, scrambling about and not remembering a single lick of the combos I thought I had beaten into my mind. Devastated, I turned off the PS1 mid match and ran up the stairs fuming with rage.\n\nAfter viewing the cataclysmic despair that I held on my face afterwards, my older brother had offered to train me himself and teach me how to play. I rallied whatever courage I had left and decided to practice with him, waiting for the day I'd finally beat him. Teaching me new combos and a new mentality on fighting games, I felt like I was getting better and closer at reaching his level. But lo and behold I never scraped his height. Every time I got into a match, the combos I had so devoutly learned fled my head as if it was opened, flipped and shaken for all it to be taken by a neighborhood bully.  I had finally given up Tekken and decided to stay away from fighting games to avoid the sheer disappointment in myself. \n\nFast forward MANY years, Street Fighter has released on PS3 and my brother has gotten me a copy, hoping to re-light the doused candle of passion I had for fighting games. Being older and more care-free, I took the game into stride! Playing the arcade, looking up combos via youtube, and testing out all of the new characters to find a feel of what I was looking for  within a year's time. Once again, I felt as if I had started a new chapter of my fighting game career, attempting to become good enough to boast of a many online matched to my friends. But they say history repeats itself, which it did. Every time I went online I was royally thrashed, not knowing or thinking what the opponent was going to do next. I had resorted to button mashing, which re-kindled my anger for fighting games, and in turn; I dropped fighting games again in lieu of preserving my sanity. \n\nFast forward to now, somehow, a copy of the Fighter Ex Layer Beta ends up on my PS4 layout as I scratch my head and ask \"when did I download that game?\". Being curious as ever, I had decided to open the application, only to find myself enjoying the characters &amp; fooling around in training mode, stringing together a few homemade combos I had tested on the Kairi dummy in the training area. I had regained my confidence once more, and decided to go online. At first it went well, gaining a few wins, in trade of a few losses. Over time the matches seemed to increase in difficulty, occasionally bodying me and leaving me laid on on the floor like an unrolled gym mat. As I said previously in the story, history repeats itself, again, and AGAIN, and AGAIN. I was getting my behind handed to me left and right and had once again resorted to button mashing. THEN it finally hit me, I wasn't having fun losing, or period for that matter. Winning didn't feel like winning, and losing irked me to the point of outward aggression. And I had to come to terms with the fact that, I JUST WASN'T GOOD AT FIGHTING GAMES. The technique, frames, timing, combos and all other aspects of the game never stuck with me in a way that it should've on its own. It seemed as if I was forcing myself to play, in hopes of beating down a poor soul online to gain momentary and unfulfilling satisfaction. That being realized, I uninstalled the beta game. Feeling a weight lifted off of my shoulders I loaded up MGSV and began to once again enjoy the solo campaign while releasing the idea of competition.\n\n\n-&gt; Now while I may have quit fighting games for good, how I feel may not apply to every, or anyone else; I just want to say that COMPETITIVE fighting games may or may not be for you. If you find yourself not finding any satisfaction with the game, I encourage you to stop playing as it will deter your mood and make you feel like hot garbage. BUT on the other hand, if you are really determined on getting better and becoming a champion of the game, DO NOT MIND A LICK OF WHAT I'M saying and GO FOR IT, While I and a few others may have succumbed to quitting fighting games, you may like and enjoy the idea of them and want improve yourself by envisioning it as a mountain of skill being climbed with every match. \n\nEITHER WAY NO MATTER WHAT YOU CHOOSE: MAKE SURE YOU'RE HAVING FUN",

I personally find that Mark Brown is a little too lenient with certain systems, but at the very least I find the discussion points that he brings up interesting to think about/reflect on/compare to my own opinions. However, while a lot of his content is about games I'm interested in, he seems to cover very little in the way of \"video game\" RPGs outside of Dark Souls and one video on the Witcher, focusing mostly on platformers, puzzle games, and shooters (to clarify, when I say RPG here, I mean games like Final Fantasy or Skyrim). I'd be interested in seeing/hearing what other people believe are elements of good RPGs with targeted analysis and examples from games like Bravely Default. I'd similarly be interested to see what are elements of failed RPGs and how to potentially avoid them, using examples from games like I am Setsuna. I know there's some GDC content on the general topic, but wanted to know if there was some other place to see what people find effective about successful RPGs/bad about the failures.",

The last game I seriously played multiplayer in was Far Cry, and IIRC it had drop multiplayer—that is multiplayer where you could join a thing in progress, or start without a full complement of players. The last game I seriously played multiplayer prior to that was Unreal Tournament 2004—which also had drop in multiplayer.\n\nDestiny 2 does not have this. It makes you wait until it finds a full complement of players for whatever mode you choose. Additionally there isn't match making for some of the modes. If I want to do the mediations, I have to somehow organize a fire team or join one. The game doesn't provide any means to facilitate this. I understand the value of be able to form a party, but is it necessary? Why can't I just start-up the mediations, or join one that someone else has created? You can do that with strikes and the crucible. Why does it make me go through difficult task of forming a party, but then not give me the means to do so in the game?\n\nWhy are the team sizes for multiplayer so small? Unreal Tournament 2004 offered 16 players per side. I get that games are somewhat more complicated now, but Unreal Tournament had weapons which had actual projectiles whose path needed to be tracked, in addition to what I assume were probably hitscan weapons (I haven't played the game in at least 10 years). Is my PS4 not more sophisticated then gaming PC I built 13 years ago?",

On one hand, it can feel like you're in the shoes of the player character because it feels like you're learning along with him/her. On the other hand, either it's unskippable, or if you do skip it, you miss out vital details to understanding the plot or the characters.\n\nThat said, I feel that a good execution of a story-integrated tutorial is in *The Misadventures of Tron Bonne*, a spinoff of the Mega Man Legends series. For a look, [here's ClementJ64's LP of said section](https://youtu.be/aMnhTOho9dc?t=4m5s).\n\nAs you can see, you're not playing as Tron, but her elder brother Teisel. In the story, it's established that Teisel is fairly new to piloting his sister's mecha, the Gustaff, so he has to recite some of the controls to himself so he can pilot it more effectively. At one point, he actually contacts Tron to give him instructions. After the tutorial is done, you're playing as Tron through the rest of the game, and thankfully, she almost never has to explain anything to herself since she's her family's mechanic and ace pilot.\n\nThe best part is that the tutorial doesn't drag too long. Unlike, say, Zelda: Twilight Princess, the whole plot is established in about 10-15 minutes, and we have key understanding behind the characters in that time. It's clear that the Bonnes are a bunch of greedy bandits, but have a strong familial bond. It's clear that Tron really wants to rescue her brother from Lex Loath. It's clear that Tron will engage in her usual unsavory antics to do so. The tutorial was utilized as a way to get the player into both the gameplay and the characters, and it does so quite well.\n\nAre there any other games that integrate tutorials into the story well? I'd really like to know.",

What does that mean for future multiplatform games in terms of features? \n\nPS4 and Xbox 1 are fairly similar in terms of performance so any game that works on one will work just about as well on the other. PC is more capable but very few developers take extra steps to make use of the extra hardware beyond framerate and resolution because they can't leave consoles behind.\n\nBut with the Switch now there is a much wider gulf. It's not awful by any means but it's very clearly inferior to the PS4 and Xbox 1 in terms of performance, and I have to wonder how that might affect the development of games that want to work on it in the future.

        "text": "And I absolutely know there's a market for one that's designed around competitive play. \n\nThe FPS scene is extremely stale, and it has been for years now in my opinion. My biggest hope for this genre was Dirty Bomb, but Splash Damage has proven (once again, *cough cough* ET:QW, BRINK - good god) that they're completely incapable of executing a brilliant concept, butchering a game that has huge potential before it could ever leave the womb of beta through horrible advertising and lack of focus on community growth. Brink had just as much promise but was a total failure due to horrible netcode and poor hit reg. The movement and gunplay was awesome, but it felt like shit when your shots wouldn't connect 30% of the time you were playing. \n\nWhat we need is a return to the golden age of team shooters: RTCW, Enemy Territory, UT, Tribes - all the greats. I see so many complaints these days about the way modern shooters are built, from the ground up, that I'm almost completely certain that a phenomenal new esport could explode onto the scene with a focused list of development credentials (AND PROPER MARKETING; I'M LOOKING AT YOU SPLASH DAMAGE &gt;:[ ). \n\nThe things that would make for this holy grail of team shooters:\n\n1. HIT BOXES and HIT REGISTRATION are 100% the number one priority from day 1. This game should be built on whatever the most rock solid netcode is that's available to date. Q3 engine is still the standard to live up to in my opinion. :p \n\n Gunplay is the focus and the main draw of the game. Headshots are rewarded but not with instant kills. Think 2-3 headshots to kill depending on the weapon, but 8-10 body shots. This makes for a very intense TTK where skilled players can quickly down multiple opponents if they have a good position and skirmishing skills, but are not being killed almost instantly if flanked or shot from behind. Mobility is &gt; realism in this genre. There should absolutely be some kind of movement acceleration to make fights more skirmishy, rewarding players who have consistent tracking, and making it less about who gets the jump. You want a game that makes it feel GOOD to hold down an objective as the last person alive on your team with a 20s respawn timer, killing the remaining 3 attackers because you out-shot them. These are the moments that drive streams wild and will attract lots of players. \n\n2. Class diversity, without dozens of different bullshit loadouts for every class. Ideally each class would have 2-5 weapon/loadout options depending on utility. TF2 did this fantastically before Valve started adding tons of ridiculous weapons. RTCW/ET are my models for the class system without a doubt. I still think those games executed it better than anything else that's come out in the ~10-15 years since their communities died. \n\n&gt;- Medic (self-explanatory, but to clarify Medics were actually the main combat class in those games - teams would have their best shots play medic because it was a class that could self heal, and sitting on stacked health packs was a very valid competitive tactic for holding a corner). \n- Soldier (highest weapon diversity, had 5 options but didn't get any other real abilities)\n- Engineer (repairs escort vehicles for objectives, plants/defuses explosives at objectives)\n- Field Ops (ammo / ordinance - artillery + air strikes)\n- Covert Ops (Sniper class, but could disguise as enemies - which was almost never valuable in competitive play due to comms. also had a very accurate silenced SMG that could be taken instead of the sniper rifles that was amazing for headshots. had satchel charges that could explode some lesser objectives much faster than dynamite from engineers). \n\n3. Tiered, but simplified level design with multiple objectives/stages. Competitive format ideally Stopwatch. I *still* get nostalgia boners thinking about blowing the wall on Siwa Oasis and rushing through an artillery barrage to try to get a plant down asap and beat the time for a round cap. Or even better, trick jumping over the wall unnoticed and getting that first Anti-Tank gun for free because you killed the one Axis Engineer who retreated to defuse it. \n\n4. Objective-focused, multi-stage gameplay. The point of maps should be to advance some sort of objective, whether escorting a vehicle initially (like Payload in Overwatch or TF2), followed by needing to plant explosives at an objective to reach the final tier of the map, usually either another explosive plant on a final objective as the win condition, or a CTF-type escort of a valuable document / other objective. The objective should not inhibit movement or your ability to fire your weapons as normal (like taking hostages in CS does for example). You want big flashy plays where players steal the objective, wipe 2-3 players on the way to the delivery point and barely make the cap to win the stopwatch round with half a second to spare. This is almost impossible when the objective prohibits movement or shooting in some way. \n\nI have more things that I could add, I would love to sit here and think about why I loved those games SO SO much and how much of that gameplay is missing from today's FPS scene, but I think this is enough to digest where I'm going with the idea for now. \n\nI'd love to hear your thoughts on the state of games like this today. It seems like the landscape is almost nonexistent, but I constantly hear people talking about how they would kill for a game like this, on reddit and elsewhere. I am definitely one of those people!",

        "text": "I'm wondering whether or not I should be ashamed of this. I know that I shouldn't take gaming too seriously because it's supposed to be fun, but when it comes to certain games, I'm so bad at their hardest levels that I feel downhearted because I feel like others are so much better than me.\n\nFor example, platformers like Crash Bandicoot. I sucked at it as a kid. I really enjoy the trilogy on the PS4 but even as an adult I cannot get past several levels due to them being so damn difficult, and the level of frustration gets to me to the point of grumbling, whining and finally rage-quitting. I especially hate it when you get sent back way too far to a checkpoint and are forced to replay hard sections over and over.\n\nIt seems like, to a majority of the gaming community, ultra-hard difficulty is a sumptuous delight, as it makes games last longer and the satisfaction of finally getting past a level is an enormous, day-brightening treat. And I can understand and respect that because I too have overcome some very tough parts of games and the feeling is really good once it's done. But to me, difficulty so extreme that you're just constantly dying and barely making progress ruins the game for me. Eventually, the frustration exceeds the fun and I realise that I'd rather play something else. Then, the memory of struggling to get past a certain levels makes me less likely to replay the game in the future.\n\nBecause of this, I haven't completed most of the games in my large collection. I literally just play them all up to as far as I can go. For some, for example, the Ratchet and Clank series, I can easily complete (the series is very fair difficulty-wise. Those games get pretty hard but never so hard they're impossible) but for others, like The Legend of Zelda, a series well-known for quickly ramping up in difficulty towards the end, I just cannot get to the end of them. They just become too hard and frustrating for me.\n\nSo I just wonder whether or not I'm alone on this. It makes me feel bad knowing that I just cannot complete most video games because my skill level just isn't high enough.\n\n**EDIT: Whoa, thanks for all the comments. I need to read all of these, I had no idea I got so many until now. Thanks! :D**",

        "author": "championofobscurity",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/7iwaip/just_cause_3_is_probably_the_most_infuriating/",
        "text": "I recently picked up JC3 because the full game was on sale for $12. I certainly got my monies worth. The movement options are by far some of the best in gaming, and the experience really delivers on making you \"The Guy\" and selling you the fact that Rico is an action movie hero. I bought it purely because of the reddit gifs of people doing stupid stuff and wanting a 3rd person shooter.\n\n\nBut for all the good it does, JC3 is fucking infuriating to play. I'm just gonna break it down into a list.\n\n1.) Probably the most offensive part of the game is the health system. It just doesn't fit with what this game is setting out to do. Never mind the innate stupidity of the \"Bleeding screen take cover\" system in of itself, when applied to JC3 it's insanity. This combined with a mandatory loading screen after every death just pours on the salt. Everything that makes JC3 unfun is a symptom of the health system.\n\n2.) Immobilization Mechanics. Normally when you get immobilized in games, you get some Iframes to go with them. Not in JC3! If you become immobilized you are fully exposed to enemy gunfire. This is for essentially any reason. Thing is, anything that would immobilize you also does a ton of damage leaving you exposed.It's especially infuriating when you get immobilized on a hill where instead of being able to course correct with a grapple shot you get stuck rolling down the hill with no iframes exposed to enemy template attacks. Being immobilized has never bothered me in a game as much as it has in JC3. I personally get flat out enraged at this point, and I am the most mellow game player I know.\n\n3.) Terrain Damage. In a game chalked full of explosions of numerous varieties, they really could have done without Terrain damage. Yeah, it's a little unrealistic, but so is propelling yourself through the air by rapidly opening up a parachute and then a wing suit. Terrain damage is a flat rate and extremely high, and they even have upgrades to reduce it, but with a game so centered on movement It's really dumb to punish players for incorrect movement when often there's a ton going on. If you grapple to the ground poorly and hit your head you take a ton of damage and are often left immobilized because of the games mechanics and then an inopportune shot from an enemy leaves you dead.\n\n\n4.)Enemy Accuracy &amp; Templates. I'm fine with Sam Sites restricting movement a lot of the time. It means that you can't strafe every base in the game with an aircraft and walk through without harm. It means that you at least have to go in on foot to disable defenses before going in with a missile heli. Cool whatever. It's when you're on the ground, and enemies that are barely rendered are hitting you with perfect accuracy that I start to lose my shit. I don't even have a problem with enemy Snipers or Missile Snipers. Those are at least fair. I'm talking about regular mook troops hitting you with an assault rifle from an absurdly long range. This seems flat out unfair at times. The other big thing that's not exactly a symptom of the health system, but is still annoying is enemy template attacks.  Sam Sites are one thing, but having to constantly move around dodging the red target without any indication of where the Tank or Battleship is is very frustrating. It's often more practical to just ignore templates and get frustrated than it is to engage with them since chances are you are going to get slagged by another tank or battleship fighting one tank or battleship.\n\n\nJust Cause 3 does a lot to innovate the modern third person shooter. It takes a lot of good from the \"Ubisoft Map Game\" and does a lot of cool and fun shit within the same vein as MGSV. But good god it's flaws are pronounced and probably the most frustrating experience I've ever had playing a game.\n\n\nCan anyone thing of anything that trumps what I listed in an otherwise good title?\n\nOr maybe I'm just 40 hours in and playing the game wrong (if that is the case, that's bad development for not teaching me how to play.)",

If you lose a teamfight in Dota or League of Legends, you have to watch how your base is being destroyed. In fighting games, like Skullgirls, you have to wait to the oponent to finish his combo, like if the main focus is the game is how many buttons you can press in a single combo instead of fighting an oponent. Brawlhalla punishes you with evasion cooldowns and losing \"jump charges\" if you're hit (you can jump three times in a row) . My view of these games might be biased but I feel that these types of punishments are too artificial and doesn't go with the fluidity of the gameplay. Are there other ways to punish players? or Is there a best way to punish players?",

They are almost always hacked within the first few weeks of the game's release and are completely pointless at that point because you have no idea where you really stand.  \n  \nWhich leads to a different question: What do leaderboards even add to a game?  \n  \nA sense of accomplishment?

        "text": "I wanted to start this discussion out of personal confusion. First, a bit of background. I re-discovered RPGs as an adult and immediatly, I became quite found of CRPGs. I started with Baldur's Gate 2 and played all of the big classics with the exeption of Neverwinter Nights and the Divinity games. \n\n\nI also am not new to Bioware, i played both KOTORs, Jade Empire, and the Dragon Age games. before playing Mass Effect, I noticed already that I was a bit annoyed with the plot and the very generic world and main enemy, but I found the gameplay and quests fun so I still understood the big praise.\n\n\n\nThe one game that I was seriously disappointed with was Mass Effect 1. I played 17 hours of it and couldn't finish it. in fact, it is also the only game I can remember where the overall reception was so different of mine. So Mass Effect 1 became interesting for me to understand why and what made me hate the game and why other people loved it. \n\n\n\nI will first make a small list of things that made me hate the game (and I really do not use the word hate lightly) and then i will list the tings that I think made some people to fall in love with Mass Effect 1. \n\n\n\n**Why do I hated my time with Mass Effect 1**\n\n\n  - Too high expectations. Of course, I expected Mass Effect to be the summit of writing, story, characters and world building. I expected a masterpiece and was truly excited to play it.\n\n\n\n*Gameplay*\n\n\n\n - Clunkiness. I was very used to the fast unrealistic movement in the game. You click on your party, it moves instantly somewhere. Here, everything felt slow dragging or tedious. Shep felt like a tank, the mako felt like steering that droid from the new star wars trilogy but with the ball full of water. \n\n\n\n - The RPG system felt like it was forced in. I had no fun at all in the progression system. I never had any power fantasy with it, I never felt like \"woooh i found that cool artifact\" or something like this. it was there and i HAD to deal with this instead of feeling compelled to do it. But this has to do with my next points.\n\n\n\n - The combat felt bad. I never could really feel good fighting, i was missing constantly, I had trouble seeing clearly and I couldn't visually or numerically see the effect of my weapons or systematic changes. And it felt, well, clunky. If this would be refined and cleared and that RPG system basically more or less cut away, I would probably enjoy it more.\n\n\n\nBut that is only the gameplay. I just had no fun at all with the gameplay. If the gameplay is either bad or not that compelling but the story is good, I would be the first to forget all the flaws. \n\n\n\n*Story and World*\n\n\n\n - Story density felt cut down from my other experiences. Playing BG2 or PoE made me used to a lot of story. I also had nothing against a compact straight story, I for exemple loved Bioshock. But Mass Effect felt as if they would take that old CRPG style, cut it down with a chainsaw to be able to voice it and... well... left no compensation in form of something else which leads to another point:\n\n\n\n - The story itself felt.. cliché. Yes, cliché. This is probably the thing that infuriated me the most and made me question my own taste. I was thinking, how is this considered great? It is microwaved food, we are dragging the same world saving clichés as we always did. I could swallow it in KOTOR 1 because it was Star Wars and I was just into the new Star Wars movie watching other Star Wars movies before so I expected light, cliché, easy stuff. But here again, my expectations clashed with the reality. i expected something original and great, something unique. And I got another tale that was also so similar in themes to Dragon Age: Origins (especially the main threat) that I was completly caught off guard. \n\n\n\n\n - The dialogues and the choice. The dialogue just made the clichés stronger. They are always screaming that they will stop the reapers and save the world etc... My choices felt ridiculous. I either had choices that made no difference whatsoever or that made me go into one of the two directions, paragon or renegade. This should go into the trashbin of RPGs. This is fine in Star Wars because of the lore being already focused on this and the easy nature of it, but Mass Effect 1 took itself seriously. The dialogues also felt like the sam thing as in other CRPGs but chainsawed to be able to voice them. \n\n\n\n\n - Side Quests. The unacharted worlds were horrible. I did one or two and never again did that. They were all the same tedious things gameplay wise to reward you with some lore. The lore was probably the depth that I needed to enjoy, but the trade off of hours of tedious gameplay to get some bits of text scared me off. The citadel on the other hand, was actually fun. But on that in the small section of what I liked,\n\n\n\n**I liked**\n\n\n - Characters. Nothing to say more, they were inventive and interesting.\n\n\n - The citadel section. Interesting side quests, not much busywork. Not extremly unique, but I liked it.\n\n\n\n**Why I think people love it**\n\n\n\n - It did something where the demand was high and the supply low. Apparently, there was a desperate need for a RPG, story heavy, world building rich space opera that nothing could do until Mass Effect. It is like Pillars of Eternity, it hits a certain demand in the perfect moment.\n\n\n\n - I am not fascinated with science fiction, other people defintly are much more passionate about this. And therefore they loved a science fiction RPG that, again, was not an usual thing in 2007. \n\n\n\n - The bringing of Bioware style RPGs into the \"modern\" cinematic age which was, at the time, very impressive.\n\n\n\n - The characters taken directly of the CRPG genre with the depth and development along the voyage that was not the norm in that generation of AAA games and impressed a lot of people.\n\n\n\n - Later games that, from what i have been told, improved the gameplay massivly thus making people remember Mass Effect as trilogy and not a single game, which is not my case. mass Effect for me are these miserable 17 hours.\n\n\n\n\nBut this post is not supposed to be a vent, it is supposed to start a discussion. i would love to hear the thoughts of people who loved this game, Why did you love Mass Effect 1, what made you so fascinated with this? \n\n\n\nAlso, sorry for the eventual bad writing, wnglish is not my native language.",

        "text": "I prefer to play games with subtitles on, and it is incredibly annoying when their font size is too small, which is happening with many games today, even though the subtitles have been a solved problem for half a century - there are clear guidelines regarding the most optimal size, color, background, etc. \n\nYet most of the games do not adhere to those, for some reason. Some of the worst examples are Sleeping Dogs and The Order: 1886, for example, the subtitle text in those games is laughably small. The optimal subtitle letter height should be around 3-4% of the screen height, and their height in Sleeping Dogs is only 1% - 3x smaller than they should be.\n\nHere is a very good article explaining the best practices for subtitles in games: https://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/IanHamilton/20150715/248571/How_to_do_subtitles_well__basics_and_good_practices.php\n\nThe game developers probably think that big subtitles would be distracting, but the truth is exactly the opposite - small text requires more concentration and time spent on reading and less on looking at the game itself.\n\nCan anyone shed some light why is this still happening frequently? Crappy testing by developers or a conscious design decision?\n",

        "text": "Games are fundamentally a collection of separate mechanics that connect in particular ways. Every game requires its players to interact with those mechanics in some way to progress and eventually win. \n\nAt the best of times, specific mechanics are communicated through direct tutorials. Click (B) to crouch. This communicates to players that the game expects them to crouch some number of times during the game. \n\nThese tutorials do not communicate the game's systems very clearly. Do I only crouch to get past the three obstacles in the 8 hour campaign? Do I use crouching to improve my gun accuracy? Does the gun accuracy boost really offset the cost of crouching that often? Does crouching suddenly become viable after a specific upgrade is acquired?\n\nIdeally, over the course of the game, players identify the most important mechanics and use them together to really make the best use of the game system. It is very possible that users will give up before they really understand, though. So I'm very interested in your experiences. What caused a game to suddenly \"click?\" Was it an upgrade? An event? A cutscene? A testimonial online? \n\n**TL;DR I'd love to hear when a game seemed obtuse until you understood that one element that made the rest fall in place.**\n\n*(Do note, it does not have to be when you mastered your reflexes to pull off the move, just once you realized the game needed you to do that.)*\n\n*Example: I was getting destroyed in Shadow of Mordor and could not understand why everyone said the game was so easy. (I was try power struggles at low levels, because I'm used to side quests that buff you for story quests.) The game expects you (at least for the first half) to disengage from fights occasionally. The system features One hit stealth kills, health-replenishing herbs that are away from major combat zones, chiefs that spawn when you are at low health, and a major strengthening of your opponents when you die. It clicked after a few story missions when I had to use the stealth system regularly, and obtained a few stun upgrades. I didn't have the best reflexes for properly timing hits, but I knew how to engage with the enemy in a major way.* \n",

        "text": "I've been an RPG Fan all my life. Action, Strategy, JRPG, you name it, I played it. I love all RPG sub-Genres.\n\nAfter hearing about the game and hearing some of the praise, I decided to give it a go.\n\nI hated my time playing the game. It wasn't fun what-so-ever. The game told me beforehand that it was about \"making the best out of a bad situation\", but I think they went about it wrong.\nI love turn based RPGs, and I believe they gave us a lot of Historical gaming monuments like Final Fantasy and Pokemon. That's why I didn't mind the combat itself, it was fine, nothing special. What really ticked me off though, is the aspect of stress, Player stress. Going through Dungeons, Getting afflicted, Battling you way through and winning, that should be fun isn't it? \"You made the best out of a bad situation\"! \n\n\nBut the truth is, Winning wasn't fun for me. All I ever thought about while playing is the chore I had to do next. Winning wasn't fun because your teammates would need therapy, AND they needed their negative quirks removed. All of this took money. Which in turn means that your next dungeon run will be low on supplies and more stressful.\n\n\nLosing wasn't fun, Because you lose your characters, but that's a given. Who likes losing?  \n\nBut the worst offender is, I hated starting dungeons. It meant that I have to worry about all the chores after I get out of the Dungeon, plus worrying about the dungeon itself. Why play when winning and losing are both Punished? Why do I want to make the most out of a bad situation? My payoff is having to do more work. Having stress build up by enemy attacks, then getting afflicted which caused more stress, etc. It caused for a loop that made the game feel like a chore where you always feel like you're not benefiting out of anything.\n\n The game made me as a person not want to play it due to wins being actual losses of my own personal time and enjoyment. I don't feel that special triumphant enjoyment in a Turn-based RPG after winning a tough boss battle. All I feel is that I want the fight to end as quickly as possible so I don't have to do more work after. It forces you to hate playing it since playing it meant more work later on.\n\nEDIT: I forgot to add something that I think made everything extremely less fun. The whole Randomness of it all. It's RNG Galore. You can get a party member afflicted within a very short time from the start of the dungeon while the rest are fine. You can finish an entire dungeon without getting a single member afflicted. It was all up to the game to decided who to inflict to the most stress damage. It felt like a roll of the dice decided if I'd be doing more work at the end of the dungeon, or even made me escape from a dungeon all together after Piling all stress on a single character. \n\nWhat are your thoughts?\n\n(English isn't my Native tongue, so forgive any gramatical or spelling errors.)",

        "text": "And why?\n\nMegaman X was the best example of a great tutorial level, because it conveys a lot of mechanics without ever stopping the flow of the game for textual \"hints\" or locking buttons until the correct situation comes up. It was also quite forgiving because it was short enough not to matter much if you failed. Jak &amp; Daxter was also pretty good because it left you pretty much open to explore the mechanics by yourself. \n\nMy personal worst tutorial was Nier : Automata, simply because it was way too long. It took 45 minutes the first time (if you wanted to explore), but it peaked the difficulty at the end of the tutorial too much. Dying put you back at the start of it, zero checkpoints, all the while reminding you that you can not save. Putting a save point at the boss would have been perfectly acceptable. It took me two hours to get out of the tutorial, which didn't even teach me how to save... Worst part is, there was nothing mechanically wrong with the tutorial and with a checkpoint in the middle it would have been one of my top tutorials.\n\nEVE Online was also really bad because it teaches you less than 1% of the game mechanics before dropping you into the game world, with no clue what to do or where to go. \n\nAlso a mention to games that lock buttons until you get a hint on using said buttons, or even worse when the game locks your entire control scheme until you press the button it wants you to. I stopped playing metal gear V because of this. \"You can target locations with your binoculars\" = you can't move, enter the menu, do anything else until you take out your binoculars and look at the thing. \n ",

I'll then feel tingling sensations on my body for a while and be looking around all the over the room checking for spiders. It sucks. I was one of the people who played Skyrim with the mod that turns them into bears, and I simply wouldn't have been able to play the game otherwise. More recently this problem has prevented me from playing the new Prey. I tried, but the mimic enemies are just too spider-like. I couldn't face it.\n\nOn the internet I've seen a few people mention that they have a fear of swimming, and that it also translates into being scared of swimming in games. I imagine this being a much bigger issue than my spider problem, because water you can swim in is much more common in games than spiders.",

I haven't gotten too far into the game, but up to the point I'm at, discovering the lore and the backstory is part of the actual gameplay - the mystery of what happened here is the story.\n\nThen I thought about a game like Skyrim, a first person RPG, that also utilises environmental clues, but also leans heavily on books being left behind, NPCs explaining lore, and flavour text on items to tell you about where they came from. When you plumb a dungeon, you can learn about its place in the world through text.\n\nOn the other hand, there are games like [Inside](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inside_\\(video_game\\)), a 2.5D sidescroller, that has no text or dialogue at all. There's a rich world, but it only provides you the visuals and relies on the player to fill in the blanks about what's actually happening.\n\nPersonally, I've found myself drawn more to the kind of worldbuilding and lore in games like Inside, where things are presented but not necessarily explained, so I get to participate in the storytelling. While it can also be cool to find a book that gives context to the environmental storytelling, there is also a bit of a downside - once you know the 'truth,' that's it. You can form your own theories outside of that, but it's already been 'answered.'\n\nBut there are challenges, of course, with the kind of open ended lore that Inside and to a lesser extend a game like Breath of the Wild presents. It can be too obscure to the point where it's hard to draw any kind of theories because what you're looking at is so abstract or seemingly indecipherable.\n\nQuestions:\n\n- What are some clever ways that games have presented lore and backstory?\n\n- Is there a balance between explanation and open-endedness in lore storytelling?\n\n- How do Western and Asian devs approach lore differently? Is there a difference?",

        "text": "[Contains spoilers for To The Moon and Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons. If you haven't played either, do so and eventually come back]\n\nOkay since I'm going to talk mostly about what I *didn't* like about To The Moon, let me preface by saying this: I really liked Johnny and River's story. It's sad, tragic despite the good ending, and it deserves the praise it received. The music is also spot on, which makes the experience all the more satisfying.\n\nBut. There were two things that were clear to me as the credits were rolling, and whenever I saw it recommended, no one mentioned anything of the sort, so I was a bit surprised by them.\n\nThe first is that To The Moon is a game where the \"game\" parts don't add anything to the experience. Having to wander through the memories looking for stuff to click on isn't just annoying, it feels like an obstacle slowing down your access to the juicy parts of the story. It doesn't even provide any real sense of exploration and discovery, since any detail contextual to the story is necessary to progress in it. I wasn't the biggest fan of Gone Home, but at least there discovering who Kaitlin and her family are and what they went through over the years is left mostly to yourself. There's no arbitrary limit forcing you to click this and read that before progressing to the next room. Or an even better example would be Brothers, another story-focused game, but one where the gameplay is integral to the narration - it just wouldn't be the same thing to be told or shown the story; the game actually makes a point of making you experience how fundamental cooperation between the two brothers is, and this in turn makes the older brother's death much more impactful. There's nothing even remotely close to that in To The Moon, a game where whatever gameplay is there feels a lot like a forced addition or an afterthought, and as a result the experience suffers for it. \n\nTo The Moon is a game with a beautiful story, but a story I can't help but feel would have been better served if it was a book or an animated movie. And I want to make it clear that I'm not putting the blame on Freebird for making it a game; games are relatively cheap to make and have the potential to reach a much wider audience more easily, so given the limited resources I assume they had, it was the best choice they could make. But I still stand by my point: To The Moon's story gets no value added for being part of a game.\n\nThe second is the rift in writing quality between Johnny &amp; Rivers and the two doctors, Rosalene &amp; Watts. The former manage to be meaningful, emotional, to make you long for the next part in their story despite the brevity of their dialogues.The latter, on the other hand, are often inane, pointless, unnecessary, if not outright cringeworthy; I have no idea who thought it would have been nice to have Watts be such a fan of pop culture references, but it clashes hard with what the game is trying to express. And it's not just that, obviously; their incessant bickering and sarcastic remarks quickly turned them into two of the characters I found most annoying in any work of fiction, and as a result their \"growth\" and dramatic moments when Rosalene decides to \"erase\" River (couldn't she just explain her plan to Watts and save me that horrible obstacle runner part...?) didn't work at all for me. How can I feel immersed when the characters I'm supposed to be playing as are two unlikable jerks?\n\nAnd in this case, the issue is not even the fact that they tried to add some levity to what is a sad story. I don't think there's anything wrong with that, but it needs to be done well. Your Name is a movie I watched recently where the fun and entertaining part are excellently balanced and don't clash in the least with its more dramatic and melancholic moments. To The Moon, on the other hand, thinks throwing a \"Kamehameha\" line in the middle of a story about illness and personal tragedy is a good way to keep the reader entertained. Comedy is hard, and as a result it sometimes requires a bit more effort than just spitting random one-liners.\n\nNow despite all this, I enjoyed To The Moon, and would recommend it to anyone that asked me. But I was also disappointed by how, despite its undeniable virtues, it feels like a game that sorely lacks cohesiveness, and suffers greatly for it. \n\n\n\n",

Nintendo also subscribes to this camp for the most part.\n\nAnd finally, we have all the casual games that dominate the smartphone scene, which claim to be free to play but inevitably demands your money if you want to advance in the game. The examples are endless, from puzzle games to strategic guild-based online games, you need to pay to stand half a chance of being useful. Lords Mobile and Vikings, I'm looking at you.\n\nSo, are microtransactions, paid DLCs and loot boxes the future, or is gaming going back to the model of making you have to play, not pay, in order to progress with the story?",

        "text": "Lately, I've been seeing a lot of backlash towards open world games that it's hard to imagine that there was a time starting in the late Seventh Generation where it seemed like open world was the future for everything, and everyone wanted everything to be open world. Linearity seemed like a thing of the past that everyone had to avoid like the plague.\n\nI remember when I was caught up in it during the early part of that period. Zelda's push for tighter storytelling seemed like backwards thinking, and it didn't help that big names like Final Fantasy 13 and later Call of Duty games received backlash for similar reasons.\n\nI got out of it by remembering that the Super Mario Galaxy duology, two of the most well-crafted platformers of this time (not that there were many notable ones) didn't go for open world and decided to make straight, focused, series of obstacles like all Mario games.\n\n(Of course, I will still agree that the Wii years were the some of the worst for Zelda, but for different reasons only somewhat related to linearity)\n\nDid anyone here go through something similar?",
