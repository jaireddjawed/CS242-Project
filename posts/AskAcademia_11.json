        "text": "Hi, everyone.\n\nHoping that you may shine a light on my issue right here.\n\nI want to develop a very simple index that may reflect some alignment between two different players.\n\nLet's say, in 100 subjects, players A and B may be favorable or against the approval of an x subject. In some of these cases, it is not disclosed how players may have voted or positioned themselves. I'd like to condense some of these possibilities below.\n\nI've thought about a scale between -2 and +2, when pro-votes would be +1, and negatives, -1. But even then, -2 is still an alignment, right?\n\nA and B approves, there's a perfect alignment between their interests (+2).  \nA rejects, but B approves, there's a conflict right here (0).  \nWe don't know what A thinks, but B rejects: there's a null case, right?\n\nSo, I'd like some help in the design of this index. Thanks in advance, anyone.",

Is it more or less weird if I am taking another class with her in a couple semesters?  \n\n\nAlso, I would very much like to meet this professor. She's indicated openness to this in the past, and has offered to write a letter of recommendation, but I'm not certain if meeting still applies since I am taking nearly a year between the last class and the next class (just life circumstances). Is it awkward to send an e-mail that basically says, \"Hey, do you have in-person office hours so I can meet you?\"  \n\n\nAny help is appreciated.",

Super small class sizes. Less than 40 students in all 9-12. It's an accelerated school. More info on me. Im not a bad student at all. I participated in class and show teachers I know the material as much as possible. I have a great relationship with all my instructors, they all like me a lot and know I am intelligent. I am know im smart as well. I'm a talented writer and have a good ethic most of the time.  I work well with others. Have plenty volunteer hours. Have impressive hobbies. I'm in multiple clubs, and am a member of our school's ASB. Along with these I have good manners and a very charming personality. Not trying to sound stuck up, I am trying my best to identify my strengths. \n  Not to the problem. From late September to ealry January I fell into a massive depressive episode and was trying very hard not to off myself for lack of a better term. This made completely homework for homework heavy classes very difficult. I have a 504 in place if that makes a difference. Anywayz official grades haven't been released yet, but i know i have 2 As and 3 Bs. But I know fs i failed English. and i got a D in math(BOTH HOMEWORK HEAVY CLASSES). a D is the best i can get in math just because of low test score. im not as worried about that tho. What I'm really worried about is the F in English. I still need to work this out with my instructors. But the f is because of many missing or late assignments. I'm unaware if I can retake the course over the summer. Hopefully I can. \n  My question is how much will these two low grades affect my chance of getting into a great college. My dream was potentially an Ivy league (Princeton preferably) but i don't think that's possible anymore. I don't know what my chances are at a school like Stanford. \nThis was just freshman year SM1. I know I am a highly capable student. If I work my ass off i can maintain As and the occasional B. But how badly will these two grade effect my chance of getting into a stellar collage? \n\nAnother other advice or personal experiences would be great too! \n\nPLEASE &amp; THANK THANK YOU!!",

I left college placed jobs for UPSC ,tried UPSC for nearly 2 years with 1 attempt. Couldn't handle the loneliness involved in the preperation,hence spoke to my dad and joined his own company. Here comes the dilemma,i joined because I wanted to keep my career clock/work ex ticking. Reason i gave my dad as to why i want to join was \"I'll do an MBA and come back to your company\" which was the only logical explanation i could give him since convincing him my decision was a task in itself. \nOnce i came out of the UPSC bubble i re-connected with my old friends and found that few are done with their GRE's/GMAT and are getting ready to fly abroad,few are giving those exams and few have finished their MS and moved on to the phase of marriage. \nThe field I'm currently working in is HVAC and it requires a lot of travelling and standing for hours which is tiresome. Working on softwares is just 5 percent of a project and the rest is done on field below the sun.With all the dust,physical pain currently i feel exausted with my work and feel if i had gone back to an IT job i could have avoided all this. \nBy research i found that having a non IT job background helps in CAT because of diversity of field and that was also one of the reason i gave my dad before joining. \nSo,what is it that gives clarity in one's life? How do you know this is the path i need to take and nothing else? I feel like Hritik Roshan at the beginning of movie \"Lakshya\" right now. \nNow that from past 2 months  things are stable career wise ,my mind tells me to restart UPSC but on the other hand i just couldn't make myself sit and study those same books again and those NCERT's/Text Books which used to feel like a journey now has become a burden. \nMy heart tells me to move on ,get an MBA. Here too there is a dilemma between abroad vs CAT since I believe doing an MBA from anything other than a tier 1 college in india isn't worth it. \nThere is a 3rd option which occasionally comes to my mind which is to \"restart coding\" . I used to like coding and see my brain put to test and finally get the desired outputs but things faded away in this journey. \n\nSo in conclusion i am in a dilemma between coding,an MBA either in India or go abroad or restart UPSC. \nPlease let me know how one makes these tough choices since it is about how we want to see our life progress and i believe there is a no point of return after these choice are made.",

They are in pretty much the same location so that is a non-factor.\n\nFor academic factors, while both universities have strong names, A has a stronger name in engineering. However, B is slightly stronger in my particular sub field. School A probably had the best advisor fit. However, school B comes very close and has more faculty in this sub area. They also collaborate on some projects, so I would get to interact with many professors. Thus, for academic factors, I would probably lean slightly towards B.\n\nHowever, factoring non-academic factors, I’m not as sure. School A has a roughly $5k higher stipend. It also has a much better housing situation and is likely be able to get housing that is some combination of cheaper, closer, and better. From a lifestyle standpoint A wins hands down.\n\nI have no idea which to choose. On one hand, I think school A has the best advisor fit, the better allowed lifestyle, and the stronger name in EE (not sure how much that last point actually matters, but I’ve seen the “prestige hierarchies” for CS in faculty hiring). With school B, however, I’d get to interact with more professors and cover a slightly broader range of my academic interests.\n\nFor others who have had similar considerations, how did you weigh them and what did you find ultimately ended up mattering?",

The post-doc decisions will only come in by the end of March. What do you advise? I doubt it's reasonable to ask either the admin or lecturership potential jobs to wait 3 months for me. Say I accept verbally (admin or lec), and ask to see the offer in writing. Now Say that takes a few days, and say miraculously the post-doc decision becomes a job offer sooner than expected. Can I get in trouble by giving an oral \"yes\" and not signing the contract?\n\nOther scenario: Say I have no choice and after seeing the offer in writing (lec or admin), end up signing a contract and then get a post-doc offer. Am I just out of luck? Would I risk a lawsuit if I accept then quit (lec/admin)? \n\nAny advice is welcome.",

        "text": "To the PhD supervisors out there: you spend 3-4 years supervising someone, you kind of get to know them, even if mostly professionally, you get to see how they work, perhaps what they like, maybe you get along super well.. Then you see them go, then you recruit for a new PhD vacancy and the process starts all over again.. Does that get difficult or easier with time? Do you sometimes wish you'd work with the same student for a longer period of time? Is it not tricky to always have to be willing to take on new people, supervise them, etc., as it can be a bit of a gamble at the end of the day? Does it consume a lot of your energy or not really? And do you keep in touch with your previous students?\n\nWell, these are many questions, so apologies :), would love to hear what you have to say!",

        "text": "Hi PhD \"student\" here. The gist of what happened was that my advisor left right as I was about to sit for candidacy to go work in industry. She told me the institution would rally around me and support me. The opposite happened. I'll spare you the details but essentially the institution just abandoned me. I did everything I could to advocate for myself and try to get assistance but no one wanted to help. No one wanted to teach. And I'll add that I'm not an unpleasant person to work with. Everyone at my job loves me. My boss just offered me a promotion because of \"how hard working I am\" his words not mine. Plus faculty in other departments in this institution and others seem to really like working with me. I have good relationships with a lot of people (all outside this department). And I didn't do anything crazy. I didn't throw a chair through a window or yell at anyone. The entire department just ghosted me overnight. I'm still trying to wrap my head around the whole thing. I've never been thrown out of school before so I'm not really sure what to do next. The other faculty have given me some advice, but I'm looking to see if any of you have advice. I was informed that despite passing all of my classes with straight As and a basically perfect GPA I don't even have the option for a master's degree. All of my hard work was for nothing. Any thoughts why I might be in this predicament at all? No one at my institution has really provided me any kind of explanation besides my candidacy exam was not good enough so I'm out. Even the feedback on it was all focused around APA errors. Can you fail candidacy because of APA errors?",

        "text": "Hi everyone, \n\nI have no academic background but I enjoy reading and writing articles in my spare time, so far mostly in art history and literature. I've published a couple, but ofc I don't have all the time in the world and it usually take me a year or two to write one. Being an amateur with little to gain from publishing, I have little understanding of metrics, unspoken conventions or etiquette in your field. \n\nLast spring I finished a new paper (on the history of photography) and submitted it to one journal I read with particular enthusiasm. I got a swift reply 'thank you for submitting etc.' and was informed it was sent for peer review. I was also instructed to email them again if I had not received a message within six months.\n\nIn early December, not having heard back from them, I sent them a friendly email enquiring about the fate of my submission. I never got an answer, waited a month and sent a second one in early January. I still did not get an answer, so I assumed it had been rejected and forgot all about it. I just received an answer which reads as follows: \n\n'*While each submission to* \\[journal name\\] *receives careful scrutiny and readings by several reviewers, we regret that it is not possible, due to lack of adequate staffing and support, to prepare and provide formal comments for the number of submissions received.*'\n\n**My question: is that common practice, to conduct peer review without comments? Or does it mean my article is 'not worth a review'?**   \nThere is no one around me with the background (or the taste) to read what I write, so I have basically no idea what it is worth. I can cope with the rejection, but I must say that I was counting on the peer reviews for an objective opinion, or at least for pointers on how I might improve.   \nEvery other paper I submitted before was either accepted, or rejected with comments. I don't think the journal's website indicate they do not 'provide formal comments', and had I known I'd probably have submitted it elsewhere. \n\n**So my other question is: in the academic equivalent of the secret hobo signs, is there one to indicate a journal does not provide comments after review?** \n\nThat's it!

It has been a disaster so far. \n\nMy undergraduate was in History and Archaeology and apart from a couple of Ancient Greek Philosophy courses I have had no experience in philosophy so far. My Master offers three different certificates based on the courses you have taken during the program : History of Science , Philosophy of Science , History and Philosophy of Science . \n\nDespite my background as a historian , both courses I took in the first semester were in philosophy since it would be a novel experience for me and novelty excites me . However , I did poorly . The main issue , as my professors have pointed out , is jumping to conclusions . I do this outside university as well . I could intuitively find resemblances between a can of coke and a crossbow . When asked to comment and explain a text written by Francis Bacon , part of my professor's comments were along the line of  ''Well , how did you come up with this ? This is not explicitly stated anywhere , this is your assumption about the meaning of the text , not the meaning of the actual text'' .  I start writing in topic and a couple of paragraphs afterwards , I am out of topic .   \n\n\nI didn't struggle during my undergraduate at all. I got 80% on most history courses without even studying half of the recommended material . By studying , I mean I just read the recommended material a couple of times without even taking notes and not attending most classes (most classes did not have compulsory attendance and the university was 2 hours commute away and I couldn't handle it) .  \n\nI asked my professors if it is  bad idea to start taking philosophy courses out of interest but they basically told me that they refuse to give me an opinion and I should probably decide on my own whether or not to do this . I can't contact my supervisor . We are severely understaffed , my supervisor does not regularly teach at our university , he doesn't have an e-mail address I can find , not even his own office . He mainly teaches at another country AND is currently on educational leave , although he will be returning in two weeks and I will probably be able to contact him , since I will be picking a course that he will teach the next semester . \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI enjoy researching and would like to get into a PhD , so I do not want to mess this up . \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo , my main questions are the following : \n\n1)Are there any recommendations on how to properly study?\n\n2)Should I stop taking philosophy courses and stick to history? \n\n3)How can I stop jumping to conclusions?",

I'm also interested in understanding intelligence not just in humans but also non-human animals and machines like Artificial Intelligence systems.\n\nI had decided that I want to study Neuroscience or Psychology at the undergraduate level, but then someone told me that biology and psychology require mathematical tools to make them more rigorous, objective and exact, and at the present moment on their own they're too messy, \n\nThey say that I won't get anywhere by training myself in the biosciences or psychology, as they don't have the level of rigor and generalized principles at present like physics has, but that by applying the tools of physics and mathematics, they could be developed in a more general form and enable us to extract principles that are universally true. \n\nI also talked to some other graduate students who then told me that it might be better to study a bioscience at the undergraduate level because 1) credentials are more valued in the bioscience than in the tech sector, where it's more about your skills and online courses are acceptable ways to demonstrate your interest, \n\n2) Biosciences involve lots of theory and lab work that you could only learn under the guidance of professors and mentors, 3) It's easier to pick up the relevant mathematical and programming skills on the side than doing it the other way around because biosciences involves a lot of theory that you'd have to cover anyway if you wish to conduct research in it later in your career, and \n\n4) If you study a mathematical science or mathematics at the undergrad level, you'd be required to study a lot of topics irrelevant to the techniques that are used to study the brain and the biosciences more broadly, but you can easily pick up the relevant topics on the side and \n\n5) It'd be easier, more interesting and more intuitive when you learn those mathematical and programming topics by applying it to the neuroscience or bioscience projects you're interested in than if you just learn the theory. \n\nI have no idea what to make of this conflicting advice. I find neuroscience and psychology more interesting, but I am open to the idea of studying a mathematical science if that would be more helpful for me in the future. But I’m not sure how to reconcile both the sides and if training in neuroscience and psychology is really that useless, and which one is easier to pick up on it’s own and which one is a better major considering my interests. \n\nI would greatly appreciate it if anyone could guide me in the right direction, so please feel free to share any comments you have. Also please let me know if you're a researcher in any of the fields I have mentioned. Thank you.",

There are about 15 participants who make it through to the final round, and the top 4 get a cash prize and their work gets additional publicity, plus they move on to further competitions.\n\nThe finals were today, and the results were very surprising. We'd all watched each other perform a lot, and we all had our own ideas of roughly top 5. Well, the person who won was surprising to all of us. Not because they didn't do well (they were fine, a little rough around the edges) but because they were lower middle-of-the-pack. There were some seriously fantastic presentations who didn't even place. So that alone would be odd, but more just an upset where you say \"that's surprising! I'm happy for them!\" and move on. But here is where the shenanigans come in.\n\nYesterday (so one day before the finals) my University, from their MAIN Twitter account (i.e. @ School'sName) tweeted out roughly the following:\n\n\"Congrats to our competition finalists, including {{eventual winner's name}}, a graduate student in {{eventual winner's department}} who studies {{pretty long &amp; detailed discussion about their topic &amp; organizations they're linked to.}}\"\n\nBeneath this write-up was a HUGE, PROFESSIONALLY DONE picture of this student in full HD.\n\nThis was then retweeted by that student's department, an 'sister' department, and they had tagged several other of our graduate Twitter handles.\n\nObviously this is a pretty bad look for the University—why shout out a single student out of 15? This person was not a returning winner, they were just one of the pack. Now, their research is on what could be considered a hot-button political/cultural topic. Whether this factors into it, who knows, but it certainly looks very fishy.\n\nI'm trying to figure out what course of action to take. I know the decisions are final, so that is what it is, but I would like the University to just answer the question of why they chose to highlight only one student, and how they chose this student. This seems like a reasonable question to me, but I don't want to come across like a sore loser. I'm just at a loss of where to go from here, I'm grumpy, and so am seeking advice while the frustration dies down. Would love to hear your take on how you'd broach this subject.",

Currently it's not funded but it aligns really well with my research interests and I find it intellectually stimulating. I also received an offer from professor B to work on project B over the summer; project B is funded and also aligns with my research interests but not as much as project A. So my plan was to work on project A until the summer, focus on project B during the summer and then return to project A when the next school year starts. I notified professor A of this plan and he offered to match the funding offer from project B in case I wanted to focus on project A during the summer. \n\nI'm not willing to drop project A so my current options are to:\n\n1. work on A until the summer, work on B over the summer, then return to A\n2. work on A entirely with funding over the summer\n\nThe reason this decision is not so easy for me is because I wasn't expecting the funding offer from professor A, so I had already met with professor B a few times to discuss project B. He even added me to his group, introduced me to his other group members, gave me access to his lab and shared confidential work-in-progress papers in the area of project B. I also think it would be valuable to get experience in both areas, and having LORs from both professors would be really helpful for PhD applications. They both happened to do their postdocs at one of my top choice schools which is a plus. I am pretty confident that if I pick option 1 I can make great progress on both projects (at least one publication for each), but the progress on project A wouldn't be as awesome as it could've been. Furthermore, there is also the possibility that going with option 1 could negatively impact professor A's opinion of me. Also, if I go with option 1 I would just keep working on an unfunded project with professor A; with option 2 he would give me funding which, in some sense, would make our working relationship \"official\".\n\nIf anyone has advice on how to proceed with my current situation, I would really appreciate it.

For instance, a technology may have more contrast or is more sensitive than current technology. But where the old tech takes data in less than a second, the new method requires an hour or a day. This work will be published. We see it all the time. The practical impact is 0, because in practice nobody has an hour or a day to take the data, but this is not a reason to block a paper.\n\nClinical journals are about methodology. If the work is done one a sample size that is sufficiently large, with a methodology that we all can agree on, the work will be published. For instance, a method is introduced for a new application and it has a sensitivity and specificity of 60% (which is just a bit better than a coin toss). This work will be published. All the boxes are ticked and there is no reason to block the paper. But looking at these numbers, this work will probably never be of any practical value.\n\nNow imagine a manuscript about a method that is based on old technology, applied to a new field where it reaches 99% sensitivity and specificity. Add having a small sample size in the mix, because who in their right mind would do a risky study on a large population? However, these numbers promise to have a serious impact on society. You will find that both clinical and engineering journals with a high impact factor avoid the manuscript like the plague. There is nothing new about the technology, and the methodology is flawed.\n\nWhy don't we review based on impact? Would it not be in the advantage of the tax payer who pays for the research that value for money is acknowledged, instead of rules that make academics happy?\n\nWhy is there no journal on impact? A journal where editors accept flaws in the methodology as long as these do not significantly impact the results, without caring about the novelty of the technology.

Is this true? I just imagine that if they're going to hire you to teach communications courses, they'd want you to have some actual experience in communications. Or am I thinking of it too rigidly? Perhaps a related area of research can be sufficient? \n\n2) I'm unsure but, I have heard that even when a job listing specifies that they're looking for an area of research/teaching that is not yours, you still can apply and there is *some* chance of being a candidate of interest. The logic being that listings are 'designed by committee', and the department doesn't always get to write what they want in the listing. In your experience, is this accurate? If it is accurate, I guess there's various caveats, like when the listing says something about \"this is part of a 5-hire thing to improve X across the university\" or if they need someone to teach quantitative methods.",

My grades in my first semester were good, so that is not why I am leaving. Mentally that’s just the best thing for me right now. I just don’t know if I should wait until the semester ends or leave as soon as possible? I am a graduate student instructor (teach undergrad students), so that’s why I am thinking about leaving once the semester ends, but my mental health has gotten so bad that I don’t even think I can wait until the semester ends. I have gotten so low mentally that I really want to just walk away and focus on getting my health right, regardless of my teaching duties. Also, the classes are extremely draining for me. I know I do not want to be here, so it’s hard for me to go to classes and do HW. Any effort I have right now I want to be putting into my health, not forcing myself to sit through 3 hr classes or extremely hard HW. I have cried so much because of how overwhelmed I am and just feel trapped. The semester ends in May but the thought of being in this program and doing everything that I am doing until May truly saddens me and causes me anxiety. I’m in this thread because I need advice. Should I finish the semester out since I have teaching duties, or should I just accept my losses and leave as soon as I am able to? If anyone wants me to further elaborate, I may be able to.

I was wondering if I could connect with you all to understand what challenges you might have faced during your pregnancy. What would have helped you manage things better? What kind of gaps you think have not been addressed yet?\n\nI would be happy to connect over chat. Thank you so much.",

        "text": "Context: I'm a foreign student studying a economics-related 1yr Masters degree in the Netherlands. I've had this plan to do another 1yr Masters in a something tourism related as it would give me a well-rounded background for the niché industry I'm aiming to work in. However, after detailed examination, I'm starting to really question the added value of the 1yr Master degrees I've screened, especially after they say that \"meeting new cultures is one of their assets\" (reminds me of not so marketable humanities degrees).\n\nAnyways, it seems to me that I'm late for the Erasmus and Work&amp;Travel train as I'm prolly ending my student life before than I planned. Hence, I'm wondering if there.are anyother ways I can do an exchange/uni internship somewhere in the US or in the EU?\n\nMany thanks in advance",
