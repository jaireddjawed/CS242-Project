        "text": "My BF (26M) and I (25F) have been dating for about a year. It's my first serious relationship so it's been a little rocky at some parts (me overcoming insecurities, anxious-avoidant attachment style, us figuring out our communication styles, etc.) but overall we have a pretty healthy and caring relationship. Whenever there's an issue, it very much feels like we're working together to solve the issue and it's not us fighting against each other.\n\nRecently, I've been feeling upset about the frequency that we see each other. We live in the same city but about 45 min away from each other by bus. We usually see each other 2x a week, once during the weekend where we'll usually spend the whole Saturday or Sunday together, and then once during the week where we'll eat dinner and watch a movie and sleep over and then separate to go to work. But other times during the week I know we're both free but he doesn't initiate hanging out. \n\nIt really bothers me because I feel like I miss him all the time when we're not together and want to spend all of my time with him but I don't feel like he feels the same way. Otherwise he would make an effort to try and see me more. It's not like we're in a long distance relationship, we're in the same city FFS. \n\nHis job has been pretty busy lately and he's said he's not always in the best mood after work, and he's also an introvert and values his alone time, but if we're in love, shouldn't we want to spend 24/7 together?\n\nI also am introverted and like spending time with myself but I also just want to be with him all the time. This makes me feel like I love him more than he loves me.\n\nDoes this mean we're incompatible?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: My boyfriend doesn't want to spend 24/7 with me. Are we incompatible?",

        "text": "When I was 13 I met this girl, Kaylee, when she moved in next door. I knew Kaylee as this very sweet but painfully shy girl. We hit it off and we started dating from when I was 15 and she was 14 for almost two years. We were very into each other, very passionate, but only when we were alone. If we were around people, she wanted them all to think we were just friends. I was a secret. \n\nShe said she loved me, but when I would ask if we could date openly, Kaylee would have panic attacks. She acted like she was genuinely scared for this to happen. I don’t know why, and she could only say she would be too embarrassed. She insisted she wasn’t embarrassed that people would know I was her boyfriend, but said she was embarrassed that people would know she had a boyfriend at all.\n\nI don’t know why and she couldn’t explain it. I know she had an abusive home life but I don’t know if that has anything to do with it because when I asked her if her dad would beat her or yell at her for dating (I heard them at it sometimes but she always made me promise not to call anyone because he would get worse) and she said no.\n\nOne day I got tired of being a secret and when I was with some mutual friends without Kaylee I told them we were dating. When they asked her if it was true, she said it wasn’t. That I was making things up. That she just wanted to be friends and she didn’t know why I would think we were dating. They believed her. \n\nAfter that, our mutual friends thought I was being a creep. Kaylee talked to me only once afterward, when I caught her crying in her backyard, and all she would say was “I told you I wasn’t comfortable with that!” She was crying so hard that she was hiccuping every other word. I wished I’d recorded it so I could have showed my friends. \n\nKaylee wouldn’t talk to me or even acknowledge me again. It was like I didn’t exist. She would look right through me. It was eerie. \n\nI made some new friends but it took a long time. The injustice of it all burned me. I lost my friends for telling the truth. And why should I be a secret anyway?\n\nFast forward to now, I just landed a new office job. Guess who works there too? That’s right, Kaylee. I didn’t know she worked here when I hired on. She treats me professionally but coldly, I can 100% tell she knows who I am but she refuses to talk to me beyond what workplace norms require. \n\nI hate her for it. I don’t deserve to be treated like this. I never did. My best friend these days, Alan (30M) says it’s immature to hold a grudge and that we were kids, but I think it’s even more immature for her not to acknowledge what she did. \n\nI’m thinking about just straight up telling her she ruined the latter half of my childhood denying what we had ever happened. Would that be a bad idea?\n\n---\n**tl;dr**: Girl who said she loved me denied we were dating when we were teenagers. Now we work together. She knows who I am but treats me in a very distant way. I hate her for it and don’t know if I should tell her.",

        "text": "On Boxing Day 2020, my mother sat with my father and told him something straightforward: she does not love him anymore, and that she's going to move out and live on her own.\n\nMy parents had been married for approximately 23 years at this point, had two children, and I had thought that things were going relatively well between them until I got this news myself. Mom left the home (conditions were horrible), moved in with a friend before moving into her own apartment, and I joined her due to the rotting conditions of the house I was living in and because I felt like I could be in a more productive, more peaceful atmosphere with her around.\n\nWe made it to our new apartment in April of 2021, and we lived there relatively eventlessly for about a year. My father had to keep living where he was on his own, because he didn't have the money to be able to either fix the place up or find a new place to live, at least not until the tail end of 2021, where he moved his most important stuff to storage, and went out of town to live in an extended stay motel for as long as he could. I was the only one who kept in regular contact with him and held generally casual conversation with him. My sister had cut off contact and my mother didn't want to talk to him anymore than she had to.\n\nDespite his attempts at finding employment, he couldn't afford to stay there either, and the final option for him was to move into the apartment where my mother and I moved to so that he wouldn't be out homeless in the street. I suppose this shouldn't come as a surprise, but things quickly got tense between them.\n\nMy father cooks the meals and usually washes the dishes, and he also goes out to get groceries. He's employed now, and while he's trying to find a place of his own, the process is going very difficultly for him.\n\nFor reasons explained below, both of them have constantly been getting into verbal shouting matches, and by November, my mother couldn't take it anymore and she left the apartment (that she pays the rent for, mind you) for three months to board with a friend of hers, before returning a couple weeks ago. I would've thought that this was all said and done with, but the arguing has once again flared back up, and I am caught in the middle of it.\n\nI will explain both sides of the story in the manner that I know it, and if anyone here has any further questions, I can try and talk with them to get a clearer, more straightforward answer. And if I am wrong with anything that I am saying, I will provide corrections in later edits of this post.\n\nIn support of my father:\n\nMy mother struck him with the news right away. It had been an issue building up inside her for an extended period if time, and she had been discussing it with my sister, but she never mentioned it to me (probably because I'm bad at keeping secrets) or my father until right after Christmas, where she broke the news all at once.\n\nHe still loves her, and he is still legally married to her. He has a religious viewpoint on this: 25 years ago, they were wed, and their had their vows, and they said that until death do they part, and he feels betrayed because she broke that vow with him. The fact that they're still technically married makes him feel betrayed by the idea and makes him believe she's committing a cardinal sin. He said he'd feel better with it if they were properly divorced.\n\nHe's also angry at the fact that my mother spends a lot of time with her friend as well, and he is under the belief that she is having sex with him. That, alongside the fact that she left him so suddenly, makes him believe that she thinks that the 23 years that they were together were all wasted, and that she's carelessly dropping everything without him in mind.\n\nHe is very angry with her friend about this, but he has said multiple times (and I personally agree with the idea, if he's monitored appropriately) that he would like to go over to his house and have a conversation with him, so that they could meet face-to-face and try to make things more clear with each other, but my mother has adamantly denied his request.\n\nOne time in the summer of 2022, my mother went out of town to have some time away from the chaos of her normal life. She had told both me and my father that she was going alone, but my father looked through her friend's Facebook gallery and discovered that he had joined her on her trip. This around the point where she had left for three months, and he believes that she's not willing to take up arguments.\n\nAll my father wants is to be treated as an equal and to be given an appropriate amount of respect by someone that he had been married to for so long, but he has lost the support of everyone except for me, he is having great difficulty finding a place of his own, and he has been lied to so much at this point that he has no idea what to believe anymore.\n\nIn support of my mother:\n\nMy mother was living in a situation she couldn't handle anymore. My father had gotten really sick with meningitis and a spinal abscess, and as a result couldn't be able to do a lot around the house. That, combined with the fact that we couldn't keep living in a place where we weren't able to shower, that dad wasn't able to put in his collective side of the bargain, and for the sake of her own mental health, she had decided to move out and try to start a new life of her own.\n\nShe brought my father in because she still cares about him, and she doesn't want to see him out on the street. To her, this is right back to square one of how everything used to be.\n\nMy mother's friend is both starting up his own business, and he has prostate cancer. He lives alone, so my mother often goes to his house to hang with him, help him with his business, and provide support in times of trouble. I think he's a really great guy.\n\nDad does not, though, and he often gets mad when she returns home at a time later than expected. She has a habit of intentionally hiding these things, because she probably believes that if he was told, the arguments would start sooner and last longer, and that it would save the both of them energy just keeping it to herself. She's exhausted with these arguments and doesn't want to deal with them anymore.\n\nShe doesn't like this because it makes her feel like she is being forced to come home at a certain time, despite the fact that the two of them are technically separated. She also doesn't like him bringing her friend into the arguments, because to her, none of it has anything to do with him, and that this is something that's completely between the two of them. She feels like he threatens her friend, and that if the two of them met, he might do something that could potentially hurt him.\n\nShe works hard, she pays the bills, and she technically has control of the apartment, but she can't kick him out, not just because that would leave him with no place to go (she's far too moralistic for that), but because she legally can't because he is still contributing to the house by buying groceries and cleaning.\n\nMy father is regularly sending her long-winded, multi-paged texts stating how he feels, even when she doesn't want to hear about it anymore. She needed some time to herself because she knew he was gonna get mad when he found out about her vacation, and couldn't mentally handle it anymore. She admits that she had made a mistake leaving him so abruptly and without attempting couple's therapy or any serious discussions, but I believe she had reached a point where she thinks that no amount of these sorts of things could truly help.\n\nAll she wanted was to move on and try to help herself in finding a life that is closer to what she really wants, but she feels like she can't do that with her technically-still-husband holding her back.\n\nIn conclusion, I am lost and confused. I don't know what to do anymore, and I don't know what to think. Both of my parents are insistent that I shouldn't be taking sides, and that I should be using my own judgment, and that they love me more than anything, and that I have nothing to do with this, but until they are able to legally divorce each other, or until my father is able to move out and find a place of his own, I know that these fights are going to continue, and I myself, with no place to go of my own, don't think I am able to handle it for much longer.\n\nThat's why I'm turning to the relationship experts here. Who's in the right, if either of them are? Is there anything that I can do or say to try and make either side understand the situation better? I love both of my parents, and I hate to see them so upset at each other like this, and I want to hear what the general public thinks about the problem that we're having.\n---\n**tl;dr**: Mom split up with dad to live her own life, dad had to return due to money issues, lots of verbal fighting ensued. It's really too long and complicated to sum up really well, in my opinion.",

I don’t want to self-sabotage and ruin a good thing just on the chance that there might be something out there that makes me feel differently, because this could just be me and something that I need to work through.

I know that she had been with guys before me but don’t know why 13 bothers me.  I guess it’s because since I’ve only been with her it seems like alot.  She told me that most of them were hookups that didn’t mean anything.  Every time I think about it, it’s just a reminder of what I failed at in life and how she got to have these fun experiences that I didn’t.

        "text": "Hi everybody!\n\nA little context: my last relationship (ended about 1 year ago) was very toxic in the beginning (as in she didn't want me to look at other girls because it made her insecure) but we worked that out and in the end she was even pointing out other attractive girls. We ended up breaking up for other reasons.\n\nNow, I met my current girlfriend about 6 months ago and made it official about one month ago. On women's day (march 8) one of the bars we usually go to held a male and female str\\*p show. We arrived late and only the guy was performing. All girls', including my girlfriend, eyes were glowing as the guy spanked random girls (which also happened to be friends of mine) from the crowd. I started feeling sick because I felt like my girlfriend was lusting for another guy in front of me and was even afraid she wouldn't refuse if he pulled her in to be spanked. \n\nShe had recently said that she didn't watch p\\*rn anymore because she didn't feel the urge/need to and I guess I thought she didn't even find other people attractive since I have felt that way before. As I was watching I felt that if it was a girl str\\*pping  I wouldn't even want to look. Neither of us had ever been to a show like that and I didn't think that I would feel the way I did. I don't think I was jealous of the guys looks and my girlfriend even described the guy as ugly but with a nice body to some friends who asked us about the event (I don't want to sound douchey but personally I think I am more attractive than the guy who was performing so I really don't think it comes down to looks). \n\nWe talked about it and she said that she wouldn't let the guy pull her in even if she was single because she is shy and everybody was watching. That didn't really settle my mind because it feels like it is only because she is shy and not out of respect for me. \n\nSo yesterday we were watching a movie and she said that some actor was really hot and it made me feel bad. Now I feel like I am the one in the place of my exgirlfriend in my previous relationship and being toxic. \n\nI don't think she did anything wrong nor do I think this justifies breaking up. Do you have any tips to cope?\n\nTLDR: Me and my girlfriend went to a str\\*p show for the first time but arrived late and only saw the guy undressing. I wasn't expecting it but I felt sick from seeing her enjoying watching it and now I even feel insecure when she compliments actors in movies.",

On the off chance that I did gather up the courage to ask a girl out, I would get rejected.  I slowly came to the realization that nobody wanted me and became content with being a virgin and alone.  My girlfriend and I have been dating for five months now.  We get along rather well and share common interests.  Despite that, I’ve learned something that has caused me alot of trouble the past few weeks.  She told me that before me she had been with 13 guys.  I know that she had been with guys before me but don’t know why 13 bothers me.  I guess it’s because since I’ve only been with her it seems like alot.  She told me that most of them were hookups that didn’t mean anything.  Every time I think about it, it’s just a reminder of what I failed at in life and how she got to have these fun experiences that I didn’t.  I also feel like my first time wasn’t special since it wasn’t hers. I’m honestly experiencing a lot of pain over this and I’m tired of living. I turned 25 two weeks ago and told myself if I didn’t feel any better, I’d just end it. I stole some morphine from a friend and drunk the whole bottle. Now it’s just a waiting game…\n\nTL;DR - I’m considering committing suicide over my relationship.",

        "text": " So I’ve been dating this guy casually for 1.5 months. On date #4, we made out nude and there was some mutual masturbation involved. As things were getting hot and heavy he just about almost penetrated me without protection. I quickly jolted away from him when I noticed this. His response? “Sorry, it’s like second nature to me.” This was before he even knew that I was not on birth control; before we even had an STD discussion. I told him that I didn’t feel comfortable having sex outside of a relationship, but I am more than fine continuing making out, and touching eachother. He agreed, respected my boundaries and I thought nothing of it. Following our STD talk, he decided to go get an STD test for my peace of mind (in case things progressed to oral sex in the future), but now I realize that he never did share the results with me.\n\nOn date #5, we watched a movie, which then progressed to a makeout session. We got naked, and talked dirty to eachother. And just as a preface, when I talk dirty, I tend to say things like “I wish you could fuck me,” but this is usually fantasy talk and not something I wanted to do in the moment. Anyway, he responded positively and asked “would you like me to fuck you?” I stopped at that moment to have the same discussion I had with him on the previous date, which was “I don’t feel comfortable having sex yet, but I’d love to continue making out with you.” He said ok, and so we continued just making out, up until he asked me at one point “would you fuck me if I put a condom on?” I didn’t want to ruin the mood, so I said “idk, maybe.” After a few mins, he went to go grab a condom and said he’s putting it on “just in case” which was understandable because when we were kissing nude and I didn’t want fluids like precum to come in direct contact with my crotch. I didn’t think this meant that he was going straight for penetration. Turns out I was wrong. A minute after putting on the condom, we continue making out, and then he subtly, but quickly slides his penis inside me. I froze and was in complete shock for a few minutes, but then I accepted it and played along with it since it was happening anyway. Immediately after it ended, I was met with immense amounts of guilt and feelings of being violated so I cried for a good 20 minutes in front of him. I was hoping he would’ve at least asked me “can I do this/are you sure” before jamming his dick inside me, especially considering the reservations I had and talked to him about. Despite this, my body responded to the sex in a positive manner which to him made it seem like I enjoyed it, but I was freaking out on the inside the whole time. Ever since this incident, which happened 3 weeks ago at this point, I’m questioning whether it was consensual, or me just not communicating things more clearly, and not sticking to my guns. I have deep feelings of regret, guilt and still feel somewhat violated.\n\nI talked to him about this, and he thinks it was 100% consensual. In a text convo, he even told me that he got my verbal consent and double checked with me. I can say with certainty that he didn’t. I never said yes, but I also never said a clear no. I’m assuming his idea of verbal consent was what I said during dirty/fantasy talk. \n\ntl;dr: Guy proceeded to have sex with me despite my reservations and lack of enthusiastic verbal consent. I didn't say anything when he went to put on a condom because I assumed it was just as a precaution in case fluids like precum got in contact with the genitals.",

We both have a few issues we need to work through and are just too emotionally/mentally burnt out to be in a place to support each other like the other deserves without burning ourselves out more. He says that he is open to getting back together in the future and that I’m someone he would marry.

        "text": "\n\n\nHi guys, \n\nI have a bit of a situation here and I’m unsure how to go about it logically, putting my feelings to the side. \n\nSome back history, I am 23 years old. My grandmother is 76. My mother is 56. I am married and have 4 year old son. \n\nMy mother and I have had issues since I was a child. I remember her being very sweet at times, attentive, always made sure I didn’t have drugs, alcohol, or random men around. \n\nI also remember some disturbing things, things that now as a parent myself, I can fathom doing or saying. I remember her getting very angry, saying she hated being a mother, should’ve had an abortion of me, I was a little b***h, wouldn’t amount to anything, I’m the reason her ex didn’t want her back, wishes she never had kids and did her life different. \n\nI was about 7-10 years old when she said these things. I remember going to *elementary school* in tears sometimes in the morning when she would drop me off. I remember asking her why she was nice to other people minutes after belittling me to the point I was crying my eyes out. \n\nWe lived with my grandma some growing up because my mother never made enough money to pay all the bills. I remember huge fights breaking out constantly. My grandma and mom would sometimes get into physical altercations. Mom would throw something or grandma would throw something down the stairs. \n\nOnce on vacation, everyone got so upset (I was about 9) my grandma wanted to jump out of a moving car. \n\n\nI believe my mother had some issues. I got pregnant at 18, moved out at 19. My husband and her have a non existent relationship.\n\nMy husband and I also have terrible marriage issues (I went from one bad situation to another). \n\nMy mom started asking for money constantly. She doesn’t work, and hasn’t in about 5 years. She claims it’s because she’s too sick to work but then at other times says “well I can get a job, maybe 25 hours a week with no problem”. She was denied her disability when she applied. \n\nSo right now, my grandma pays every single bill. My mom was asking me for extra money for food. Then I was buying laundry detergent, gas, extra bills. I caught her in lies about the bills. A bill my grandma already paid, my mom would ask me money for. \n\nI remember once I bought her a toothbrush and she complained it was the wrong brand. I got her orgel for her tooth and she complained it was bad because it wasn’t “name brand”. \n\nWhen my mom was upset the last time, It was because she randomly showed up to my house and I didn’t come to the door because I was dressing my son. So she went home and sent me a long text stating I should’ve let her in. She doesn’t respect any boundaries. \n\nThat was the final time I talked to my mother. Maybe 6 months ago? \n\nShe bagged up everything I ever gave her and randomly dropped it off outside my apartment on my front porch. Didn’t even know she was coming. \n\nI’ve ask one simple thing from my grandma- I want no contact with my mother and I don’t want my son having any contact with her. And if she talks trash about me, tell her to stop.\n\nI still ask occasionally how she is to make sure she’s alive and well. \n\nMy problem is- my mom still continues to text and call my grandma bad things about me. Then, she gets upset when my son is over there, and we won’t allow her to talk to him. He is 4 and doesn’t know what’s good for him. \n\nI have stayed inside for the last 7 days so I could go over to my grandmas house. She is very high risk, and we don’t want to risk giving her Covid. So every time we go over there, we quarantine and test. Which is very hard to do considering I have a son who wants to go out. \n\nMy mom knows I was spending time with my grandma, and so she made plans to come stay with my grandma for 3 days. I had plans to go over there Monday, but guess not now. \n\nI feel betrayed if I’m being honest. I never had an issue with my mother having a relationship with my grandma, but I’m tired of the constant disrespect. My grandma and I never had a normal relationship, she was *like a mom to me*. \n\nI don’t know how to go about this, but at this point, it’s crossed my mind cutting everybody off to get some peace. I know if my mother was continually talking badly about my grandmother, I would’ve said something. \n\nAll of this really makes my POTS horrible and my chronic health conditions. I deal with really bad panic attacks, currently getting over agoraphobia with exposure therapy. The stress is sending me through the roof. \n\nI feel like this is beyond just a mom and daughter having a fight. I’m not sure if it was abuse growing up, but I know it’s not normal. And it almost hurts my grandma chose to have contact with her after knowing how badly it has been. \n\nThe stress only continues because it goes “through” my grandmother. My grandma tells me what my mom says about me or the texts. \n\nJust a few minutes ago my grandma said my mom “broke everything in her apartment and cut her foot” because she thinks I purposely planned on spending time with my grandma during “her days” when we had this planned for weeks. \n\nI just can’t take anymore.\n\nHow should I handle this? It’s really negatively affecting my health?\n\nTLDR; I went no contact with my mother. She continues to talk badly about my to my grandmother. My grandma tells me about it and it upsets me and gets me very anxious. My mother continues to start drama and issues. My grandmother continues a relationship with her even though she says she “can’t stand her, doesn’t trust her, and is fed up”. It feels very two faced to me",

        "text": "So my boyfriend (M35) and I (F23) have been together for almost three years. We're both very adventurous and spoke early about opening things up. However we have only just begun adding in partners.  \nI have had one experience with him watching, and one other failed attempt. He was supposed to meet a girl alone before this, but we got into a fight (I was just starting my period and it ended up being really bad timing, I was too emotional in general), and the second girl was for a threesome. She ticked all the physical boxes, but we had a ft and I didn't gravitate to her, although I was still open to doing it.  \nI don't know if this is an issue though? Do i need to like the girl particulary? I don't always need to like the man im playing with...  \nI spoke to my boyfriend about this, but he was really ready to shut it down. He is worried I will feel bad etc. which I totally understand, but I think on some level I just need a bit of a push to get going (I had some concerns before we did things the other way around too).  \nI also feel like maybe he's not saying how he feels incase he hurts me, he's very sensitive to my feelings, but I also want to make sure he's happy!  \nHis conclusion that night was that we wasn't being open anymore, and he said he wanted to close the relationship. Since, we have discussed that we could do things in a more organic manor, and sort of not put much emphasis on it for now...  \nThis was good for me, and a few days later I deleted the chat messages I had with the other guy wee successfully saw.  \nIm very curious about playing with other girls, and open to anything my partner wants to indulge in. However I feel really bad that I have not been into the most recent girl and the timing issue with the girl before. I feel like im letting him down and not being a good partner. I want him to be happy and enjoy himself, that gives me joy (and turns me on)! And we haven't had any of these kinds of issues with him, although he did say with some of the male options I had that he wasn't interested in them, but it was before a ft call etc.\n\nToday he asked me if I still had the guys number and if I wanted to message him. I said I didn't, but I could find it if he wanted to still do this. He said he would like to if I would. I did enjoy what we did together, but it wasn't a massively significant point in my life. My conclusion was that it was just a different sexual experience, I thought it would feel more... naughty/ bad? I'm happy in my relationship, and I enjoy that my partner gets something out of this dynamic. I do too, I mean its just sex for me, that my partner gets a lot out of. But I'm not sure why he wants to keep doing this when he was quite adamant about closing the relationship up (I never said it). I think nows a good time to mention that the focus was on me sleeping with other men in the first place. He was interested in that and I was too, however he felt that it would be unbalanced if he wasn't able to too (which I was totally fine with and curious about). It was all a very exciting fantasy at first.  \nSo is it fair to conclude he enjoys this mostly?\n\nSO heres a few summary questions\n\n\\- Do I need to really like the girl?  \nWhat I've learnt from this is that its a different game for men and women.  \nIm a girl that doesn't need connection for sex and some men dont either (i dont want to generalise), so the process of hooking up is quite straight forward.  \nIm not huge into texting these men, so again it's not massively a thing in regards to connecting.  \nA little bit of sexting and photos sporadically. My boyfriend LOVES this btw... It turns him on a lot!\n\nFor him it seems to have been quite different.  \nHe likes to connect (in general), and it seems that most girls like to have a bit of connection too. So he has been building up these connections, chatting more regularly.  \nThe girl we FT he wanted to pick up and have drinks first... but in some ways i see this being part of his communication style? And this girl seemed to be like that herself. She was also very into me and exploring her bi side.  \nI saw their messages and was totally fine with this, but I just didn't gravitate to her on the call. I don't think we'd be friends in real life, but that would be the same with some men ive been with, so does it really matter? Plus I was happy to go forward, he wasn't.  \nI think he wanted me to be more friendly with the girl, which made sense, but I didn't expect it from him. Again different dynamic though, right?\n\n\\- Should I push him to explore with girls a little more?  \nI really discussed with him after that I still want to do it, im really curious, but he seemed to have made his decision.  \nIt's almost as though, because I don't get the same thing out of it he isnt happy. I think thats a little unreasonable, as its not exactly the same thing. Do I just need to be a little more accommodating and encouraging, so he feels good about doing it? I dont want it to be the things im doing/ saying thats making him feel bad.  \nIm super curious about doing it and I think it could be a lot of fun.  \nOr do you think that maybe he's much more into the other stuff and not really into this as much, but just wants to keep it even. He said himself it's a lot of work with girls. He feels he has to host and keep everyone happy. That is feeling a little stressful for him.\n\nOpen relationships are hard... they require a lot of communication lol! Any insight would be great x  \n\n\nTL;DR! - Boyfriend wants to close the relationship he opened.",

        "text": "\nI hadn’t dated anybody before her.  I was bullied alot during my childhood and developed social anxiety.  I started staying home alot more out of fear.  On the off chance that I did gather up the courage to ask a girl out, I would get rejected.  I slowly came to the realization that nobody wanted me and became content with being a virgin and alone.  My girlfriend and I have been dating for five months now.  We get along rather well and share common interests.  Despite that, I’ve learned something that has caused me alot of trouble the past few weeks.  She told me that before me she had been with 13 guys.  I know that she had been with guys before me but don’t know why 13 bothers me.  I guess it’s because since I’ve only been with her it seems like alot.  She told me that most of them were hookups that didn’t mean anything.  Every time I think about it, it’s just a reminder of what I failed at in life and how she got to have these fun experiences that I didn’t.  I also feel like my first time wasn’t special since it wasn’t hers. I’m honestly experiencing a lot of pain over this and I’m tired of living.\n\nTL;DR - I’m considering committing suicide over my relationship.",

We love each other very much and have a good relationship. \n\nThe last three years almost every month my GFs dad has asked her to join his transportation company that he owns. Much better benefits, better pay, etc. Good ol’ nepotism (although she is very qualified). \n\nThe only problem is that the job is mostly half the country away. The hours are 10 on 4 off. It can be up to a two day drive home too so there will be times she may not make it home. There is no consistent location to me relocating to a different area is not an option. There is no set schedule on places so planning flying out is also off the table for the most part. \n\nAfter being asked so many times over and over by my GF I finally cracked and I agreed. I know I could have said no but eventually I got tired of it. Her parents have also put the pressure on me too. My girlfriend has complained for the last year especially about her dead end job. I didn’t want her to resent me for holding her back.\n\nI will miss her terribly. I also had major stomach surgery a few weeks ago so this comes at a bad time. I can’t even lift anything heavy for another month. I will need my friends to carry my groceries when I go shopping. I cannot shovel the snow because I cannot strain either. \n\nI also did not ask to take care of her two cats. I am a cat lover but if I were single and living alone, I would not have animals. I have OCD that causes me to be afraid of germs and have a hard time cleaning the litter box or cleaning vomit (moderate emetophia). The one cat has a habitually poopy butt which makes me GAG. I did a lot of chores and we split these evenly previously, now I am left with doing everything.\n\nI know I “agreed” but I felt kind of pressured by her and guilt from her family too. I feel like this is a lose lose situation. I want her to follow her “dreams”. I just feel like the relationship will not survive this. I don’t know what to do, think and I don’t know how to cope. \n\nIf this happened in your relationship: would you break up, would you stay? Would you be hurt? What would you do? \n\nTLDR: My girlfriend is taking a job on the road working halfway across the country from me. There is no way for me to relocate. Ten days on four days off (she might not be able to make it home each time). I am heartbroken and upset and felt guilted and pressured into it. What would you do? How would you feel? Do I have a right to be upset? I feel like I’m going insane",

        "text": "Backstory:\n\n4 years ago I was back at my home country after working abroad for 3 years as a software dev.\n\nI remember feeling very lonely throughout my time living abroad. So when I came back to my home country I chose the capital to live in where I didn't know anyone so I downloaded tinder.  \n\nStarted swiping left and right until after a few weeks I met my current gf. I liked that she was humble, seemed to have decent values, there was some attraction, sex was decent. We didn't have much in common though, but I decided that I want to proceed to get serious with her and build a future on the fact that she has good values and maybe I will help her to grow, so we started dating.\n\nWe were dating for around 2-3 months and I liked that she showed me around the city and also was constantly offering lots of activities, sex was also like I said decent and after around 3-4 months of relationship I offered to move in together.\n\nFast forward 4 years:\n\nI don't like so many things about her, for example:\n\n1. She doesn't have any close friends to hang out or to talk about her life and do girl things together\n2. She doesn't have any hobbies\n3. She can't cook. I mean she tries but food basically has no taste. Even after watching hundreds of episodes about cooking.\n4. She gained like 25kg\n5. She nags me constantly about lack of attention, affection and about lack of sex\n6. She began pressuring me for us to get married and have kids. Pressure is coming from her two married sisters, from her mother and also she scrolls insta daily where all her uni friends are getting married and have babies.\n\nSo basically we are at this point where we either get serious, postpone the decision for a year at maximum or breakup now. And I'm not sure what I should do.\n\nI'm not exactly a golden boyfriend myself, things that I don't like about myself:\n\n1. I have ADHD\n2. I'm a stressed out workaholic\n3. Im at least 30kg overweight\n4. I Have zero libido, we have a dead bedroom (my girlfriend likes having sex but for me it's been a chore lately, we do it max once a week). That is impacting our relationship but I can't change much about this at the moment. Since I'm constantly stressed out, I could barely get it up even if she was 10 out of 10 (and I had that experience in the past already). But she takes it very personally and started to get resentful about that.\n5. I'm not romantic or very affectionate at all, only doing boyfriend things like flowers or movies on national holidays\n6. I never plan any activities for me and my gf to do together. I never surprise her. I simply don't have the energy for that. I do the boyfriend stuff like flowers and movies on national holidays but that feel like a chore, not like something I really look forward to.\n\nSo what I think happened is those 3 years abroad messed me up and I came back to my country very lonely and with really low standards. \n\nI knew from the start that we barely had anything in common with this girl, but I've liked that she felt like a safe choice because I could trust her and she would never betray me. I hoped that she will become more like me and we'l have more interesting things to do or talk about, but lately we barely have anything in common. \n\nNowadays all I feel is that I'm shouldering all of the responsibility myself:\n\n1. 2 years ago I saved up enough to get a mortgage and I felt serious about her so I put her name on papers even though I financed the whole thing. Moving in required taking up additional debt that I'm working hard to pay off I'm stressed because of that ever since.\n2. Since I make good money, for the past 4 years 85% of the time what we eat is takeaway that I order\n3. I finance all vacations and trips abroad\n4. 2 years ago we got a dog that she wanted but I'm the one who's taking care of the dog 90% of the time.\n\nWhat doesn't help is that she broke her leg 4 weeks ago and since then we are stuck together in home working from home together. I feel like I'm loosing my mind. I was able to cope with this relationship when I had 10-11 hours to myself everyday of working/alone time, but now I don't have that anymore.\n\nMy only alone time right now staying up late until 3-4am, binge eating, binge watching tv shows, drinking alcohol and knocking myself out with a xanax so I could sleep. I like going to sleep when she's asleep because I know she won't force me to have sex with her. During the day I rely on caffeine and cigarettes to numb my emotions so that I wouldn't be suffocated emotionally with constant emotional/household needs during the day and I could enter workmode where I'm able to do some actual work. That's how I live now.\n\nRight now my dream is that in 2-3 weeks her leg heals completely and she goes back to working in the office, then I will retain my alone time and hopefully will be able to drop the bad habits that I'm using to cope now and hopefully I will feel better. \n\nBut lately Ive been thinking, how we are going to live together in the future if he get married and have babies, If I'm loosing my mind by just staying with her together stuck in home for few weeks? I'm bored of her. I feel like her father, not like her potential husband. I know partially it's my fault, because I got myself into this state,  maybe if I learn how to relax, fix my habits, regain my alone time for recovery, maybe then I will be able to look at this situation from a better perspective when I will have more clarity. But right now, everything added up. I feel totally hopeless and not ready for getting married or having kids because that just means more extra work, with more extra nagging. I don't know what to do. Any opinions or advices welcome.\n\n---\n**tl;dr**: I'm struggling with my relationship of 4 years with my girlfriend who I no longer feel connected to. Maybe it's because I've been very stressed and overwhelmed lately since I've been taking care of her because she broke her leg few weeks ago and now we spend all of our time working and living from home. \n\nHowever I feel that we have different values and interests, we have a dead bedroom mainly because I have zero libido due to stress and probably due to the fact that both of us gained a lot of weight in the past 4 years, I don't know. Also she constantly nags me about attention and sex while also pressuring me to get married and have kids. \n\nI have my own issues to deal with and feel like I'm shouldering all the responsibilities in the relationship. How should I proceed?",

What do I do?\n\nI married a rich man when I was young and stupid, ditching my boyfriend from highschool for him. Only to hook up with him and spend time with him. During that time we had our son and then our daughter. Our son is the spitting image of his father and eventually my ex husband realised the truth and did a dna test on both of them before divorcing me. Neither were his.\n\nAfter that I moved in with my boyfriend and we had 2 more kids and we had a happy little family but a lot poorer than id originally planned to be but we were happy.\n\nWe didn’t tell our kids about their past, our eldest remembered a little bit of it but we told him that was my ex boyfriend and I was only dating him for a little bit.\n\nMy sister has never approved of me and my current husbands actions and was very passive aggressive at our wedding. She’s now decided that our son deserves to know the truth and told him the whole story. I came in to the room and sat down and my sister was sitting there looking all sympathetic and my beautiful boy was looking at me with the hate she’d given him. I was like looking between them like “what’s just happened” then my son says “we’re u ever going to tell me the truth about how you cheated on your first husband and that’s why I’m here?”\n\nI went over to hug him but he pushed me away told me I was disgusting. I tried to hug him so many times but he just kept pushing me away. He ended up walking out to his room and I was chasing him begging him to listen to me but he ignored me and slammed and locked his door. I found my husband and cuddled him while crying and told him what happened. He told me to give it time.\n\nNow my son as told all our kids and they are all ganging up and seeming to hate me and their dad now and it’s upsetting me so much. I just want things to go back to normal how do I do this and how do I fix my relationship with my son?",

        "text": " I became exlusive with my gf (25F) about 4 years ago. We had a great start and quickly moved into a very small flat which was hard to live shared in. It was also my first real relationship and I wasn't used or had learned to communicate maturely in an adult relationship by that age.\n\nSo needless to say, after the first 6 months or something we started to get on each other's nerves, and the pandemic didn't help, especially in that small space. I've always loved having my own space, and not even having a room I could be in by myself anymore really made it worse. One thing led to another and our relationship became mutually abusive in my opinion.\n\nAt its worst I have:\n\n* Grabbed her shoulders and shook and yelled to her face to \"FUCKING LISTEN\" (on 2 or 3 spearate ocassions, can't remember)\n* Called extremely harsh words that I can't type because posts are filtered on those words\n\nShe has:\n\n* Called me things I don't remember (Similar degree to what I said but not as often, and I still feel to this day that I said often instigated saying those stuff)\n* Hit me on 3 separate ocassions\n\nI've fully forgiven her and she says she has fully forgiven me and the she never even thinks of that past anymore and that she really loves our relationship and she wants to marry me. Now it has been over 2 years since we last had any of those fights. We both went to therapy and learned to communicate. We used to have serious discussions when we were tired and hungry but now we save those for when we are rested etc.\n\nI used to feel extremely ashamed of my actions, so I called my dad crying and told him everything and that he would probably not be proud over me if he knew the real me. He listened to what I've done and told me he loved me the same. I told my brother too, and he told me that it could be way worse and that he sincerely thinks I am a good person and that I will take care of my gf.\n\nThe thing is, my gf loves me so much and I love her the same, if not more. I think that's why we got some codependency thing that turned ugly and since neither of us had any real experience we were so bad at communicating. I can recognize that I was ashamed of this and immediately tried to take actions to change this behaviour and successfully did. For that I am somewhat proud.\n\nBut the thoughts still haunt me to this day. If my MIL knew all the words I've said to her daughter, would she still love me the same? My therapist told me I'm worthy of love, but honestly after what I've said and screamed at my gf I don't believe so. I believe that no matter what I do I will always be a person that has, at the very least, to some degree abused the person I love the most. I also understand how it happened but I still can't understand that I LET it happen. It still makes me feel pathetic to this day.\n\nDoes anyone have any tips for me? Do you also believe I am a bad person for what I have done?\n\nAny advice is helpful at this point. I asked my gf about this and she said that people may judge us but we make each other happy and people on the internet always advocate breakups because they aren't invested or in love with that person themselves. But I still thought it might be worth a try to reach out here since therapy hasn't helped me get rid of these thoughts.\n\n \\---\n\n\\*\\*TL;DR;\\*\\* : I abused my partner and I can't overcome the feeling that I will always be a bad person in everyone's eyes if they knew everything I've done",

        "text": "Backstory:\n\n4 years ago I was back at my home country after working abroad for 3 years as a software dev.\n\nI remember feeling very lonely throughout my time living abroad. So when I came back to my home country I chose the capital to live in where I didn't know anyone and I downloaded tinder.  Started swiping and after a few weeks I met my current gf. I liked that she was humble, seemed to have decent values and I decided that I want to proceed to get serious with her and build a future on that, so we started dating.\n\nWe were dating for around 2-3 months and I liked that she showed me around the city and also was constantly offering lots of activities, sex was also decent and after around 3-4 months of relationship I offered to move in together.\n\nFast forward 4 years:\n\nI don't like so many things about her, for example:\n\n1. She doesn't have any close friends to hang out or to talk about her life and do girl things together\n2. She doesn't have any hobbies\n3. She can't cook. I mean she tries but food basically has no taste.\n4. She gained like 25kg\n5. She began pressuring me for us to get married and have kids. Pressure is coming from her two married sisters, from her mother and also she scrolls insta daily where all her uni friends are getting married and have babies.\n\nSo basically we are at this point where we either get serious, postpone the decision for a year or two or breakup now. And I'm not sure what I should do.\n\nI'm not exactly a golden boyfriend myself, things that I don't like about myself:\n\n1. I have ADHD\n2. I'm a stressed out workaholic\n3. Im at least 30kg overweight\n4. I Have zero libido (my girlfriend likes having sex but for me it's been a chore lately, we do it max once a week)\n5. I Don't have any real friends to hangout with and prefer staying in home\n6. I'm not romantic at all, only doing boyfriend things like flowers or movies on national holidays\n7. I never plan any activities for me and my gf to do together. I never surprise her. I simply don't have the energy for that.\n\nSo what I think happened is those 3 years abroad messed me up and I came back to my country with really low standards. \n\nI knew from the start that we barely had anything in common with this girl, but I've liked that she felt like a safe choice because I can trust her to do the right thing and she would never betray me. \n\nHowever nowadays all I feel is that I'm shouldering all of the responsibility myself:\n\n1. 2 years ago I saved up enough to get a mortgage and I felt serious about her so I put her name on papers even though I financed the whole thing. Moving in required taking up additional debt that I'm working hard to pay off I'm stressed because of that ever since.\n2. Since I make good money, for the past 4 years 85% of the time what we eat is takeaway that I order\n3. I finance all vacations and trips abroad\n4. 2 years ago we got a dog that she wanted but I'm the one who's taking care of the dog 90% of the time.\n\nWhat doesn't help is that she broke her leg 4 weeks ago and ever since we were stuck together in home working from home together. I feel like I'm loosing my mind. I was able to cope with this relationship when I had 10-11 hours to myself everyday of working/alone time, but now I don't have that anymore.\n\nMy only alone time is staying up late until 3-4am, binge eating, binge watching tv shows, drinking alcohol and knocking myself out with a xanax so I could sleep. I like going to sleep when she's asleep because I know she won't force me to have sex with her. During the day I rely on caffeine and cigarettes to numb my emotions so that I wouldn't be suffocated with constant needs and attention during the day and I could enter workmode where I'm able to do actual work in order to make more money. That's how I life now.\n\nRight now my dream is that in 2-3 weeks her leg heals completely and she goes back to working in the office, then I will retain my alone time and hopefully will be able to drop the bad habits that I'm using to cope now and hopefully I will feel better. \n\nBut lately Ive been thinking, how we are going to live together in the future if he get married and have babies, If I'm loosing my mind by just staying with her together stuck in home for few weeks? I don't know to be honest.\n\n---\n**tl;dr**: To sum it up, I'm in a 4 years relationship with a nice and decent girl with reasonable needs that just wants to spend time together and have sex. Also she wants to get married and have babies soon. I'm a workaholic guy who's only purpose of existing is to work(which I really love), get paid, pay off debts and hopefully have a nice life in the future. I cope right now with stimulants and I am so numb that my libido is zero. That has been going on for a few years and my ADHD doesn't help. I don't feel like I have anything in common with this girl. We have different tastes in music, different tastes in tvshows, I'm influenced heavily by western tv shows while she barely speaks english and relies on local content. I also took up all of the responsibility in our home, all she does is clean our home sometimes and then naggs me for attention and going out activities. I feel like I'm with a child, not with a strong partner that I can rely on. \n\nI started to think that we are not actually compatible and she would be better off without me. What should I do?",

        "text": "I (f21) have been living with my boyfriend (m27) for almost a year and overall it’s been great. The only thing that’s been bothering me is the house management. A few months ago, my bf got laid off and hasn’t been working since. He will be working in a few weeks but these past months have been making me feel some kind of way. I clean every week as much as I can with all the tiredness I have except for last week. I’ve realized I’ve been cooking a little more than him. And when I’m working the 4 days out of the week, the house is messy. Especially the kitchen. I know I’ve been messy after I cook but I still clean my messes after a day or so. All my bf does is load dishes in the dishwasher and take out trash. He cooks every now and then and last week he cooked for those 4 days I’ve been working. But that’s it. The other day we were talking about random things until I brought up how sometimes I wished I was a house girlfriend (though I really don’t and it’s because I’ve been exhausted) he immediately says he likes independent women and I’m not gonna lie, I felt like crap and didn’t really say much until the next day after I came home from work. I asked him what he meant by “I prefer independent women” and he said the generic thing like he likes women who have their own money etc. I told him I felt offended because I thought he said that because of what I said about being a house girlfriend. And I asked him why he said that. He said just to make conversation. Honestly I didn’t believe him so I continued on saying I don’t feel secure with him if I were to lose job and would be afraid to leave him. He said he wouldn’t and would take care of the bills\nMore to this I’m exhausted after work and I’ve been cooking for him after I get home. All he does is play video games, studies, and takes naps. I feel he doesn’t prioritize cleaning the house. I too go to school and sometimes I don’t want to work on assignments because the house is messy. Is there any way I can talk to him about this clearly? This isn’t the first time by the way. I want to be firm and direct but not rude and hormonal (I take birth control so my mood swings are over the roof)\n\ntldr; I resent my boyfriend for not helping with chores and not cooking for me on my days off.",

        "text": "My boyfriend [25M] and I [23F] have been together for almost 8 months now. The first 4 months of our relationship was long distance, and now that we've been in the same place for a while, I'm noticing some things that are raising flags for me.\n\nMy boyfriend has admitted that he doesn't express affection easily. He said that his past relationships ended because of this. The main things that I have hangups with doesn't give words of affection and I initiate sex most of the time. These are two hangups for me that I've communicated with him about a few times. But each time I've brought it up, he first gets extremely irritated, then says he'll \"do better.\" I've also pointed out that I do small things for him all the time, ex. bake his favorite cake, pick him up a candy bar when he's having a bad day, etc., and that I don't need stuff like that all the time, but it would be nice if he could do those small gestures now and then. I specifically brought up buying flowers as an example, and he basically said, \"I was planning on buying you flowers this weekend, but if I give them to you now it makes it seem like I only did it because you asked!\" It's been two months since that conversation, and neither those flowers nor any other gesture has materialized. Meanwhile, I am always anticipating and fulfilling his needs, as well as accepting and working on the things he thinks I could do to make our relationship better.\n\nI also told him that I want him to plan dates every once in a while. We do stuff together like hiking and rock climbing, which are both our favorite hobbies, but I want to do different stuff now and again. I've planned romantic dates for us before, and asked if he could put in effort to do the same. I was met by him telling me that he doesn't see the point because the outdoors-y stuff we do together is \"so much more interesting than going to dinner or going mini-golfing\" (his examples, not mine). So we always end up doing what he wants.\n\nThe one emotion he definitely has is anger. He gets frustrated extremely easily by little things. For example, when we were eating dinner, I accidentally got food on one of his blankets. He got angry and told me I don't respect his things. I told him afterwards that if he had done the same thing to a possession of mine, I would've just laughed it off and thrown it in the wash. Just this morning, he couldn't get a container to open and he was cursing for five straight minutes. This really triggers me because my dad was exactly the same way: irritated and ranting all the time over anything. However, I just stay quiet when he's venting and let it pass. He doesn't do the same for me when I get annoyed. He gets irritated when I am and tells me to \"calm down\" and says he \"doesn't know why I'm being like this.\"\n\nThe worst way in which his anger manifests is when I'm expressing my feelings. I am an admittedly insecure person, and I've been in therapy to work on that and my anxiety (I'm putting the work in, and I'm proud of myself for getting better!). This week, when I was telling him that I felt like I was putting more effort into the relationship than he was and that I felt unappreciated, he blew up, saying he \"can't believe you're bringing this up again.\" I started crying and told him that maybe I shouldn't stay the night because we obviously can't have a productive conversation right now. He said that if I was going to leave, I should also leave the key to his apartment behind. This isn't the first time he's said something along these lines. Whenever we argue, he blows it up and tells me to not come back. I told him he needs to stop doing that because I believe it's manipulative. I have always forgiven him for it, and he begs me to.\n\nWhen I get mad or express my feelings, it's the end of the world for him. But when he does it, he's asking me for forgiveness and that he'll try harder. I haven't seen that progress from him whatsoever, and I'm almost at the end of my rope. I also feel like I might be asking for too much from him and that maybe the problem is me for being too needy. Is there any way I can do better in communicating with him to try and make this work?\n\nTLDR; My boyfriend gets annoyed or angry when I express my needs and emotions. I feel like I might be asking for too much.",

The best friend(Who he is no longer in contact with due to just general pos behavior) lived across the country from us as he moved away from his son and also Jessica(they were broken up for a while at that point.) \n\nBy the time James had moved away, my boyfriend had become kind of an uncle figure to his son. My boyfriend loves children and he is incredibly close to the little boy(we’ll call him Gus), so after James moved away, he continued to make an effort to spend time with Gus and eventually became friends with Jessica. They hung out a lot, a lot of it due to my boyfriend trying to ensure that this kid that he cares about has consistent figures in his life. Jessica has a lot of issues, and one of the main ones is the revolving door of people(particularly men) that come in and out of her life, and as a consequence, her son’s life.\n\nWhen my boyfriend and I met, he was very open about his relationship to this child and his mother and I was okay with it. I also love children and it did not take very long for me to love Gus too. I also got along with his mother in the beginning, we have some things in common and she can be fun at times. \n\nBut as time has gone on, it has become more and more clear that Jessica is an energy vampire. This woman has an absolute crisis and needs to be rescued like once every 6 months. And she just Can’t. Be. Single. She is fairly good at being a parent most of the time, but the part that she just can’t manage is consistency in her relationships. Which wouldn’t be as much of an issue if it didnt affect her son, but it does because she just brings these men around before truly taking the time to screen them as decent partners. Not in a way where I am worried about Gus’s safety, but in a way of she starts dating someone and then all the sudden they’re moving in together or they’re always around and there’s no adjustment period for Gus. \n\nThe amount of times we have helped her move under duress because all the sudden she and the person she’s dating break up suddenly(even though we tell her that things are not looking great and she should consider looking into breaking it off) is getting ridiculous. Honestly, we don’t do it for her, we do it because we don’t want Gus to suffer from her behavior. We’ve picked her up, we’ve taken Gus whenever we can, watched her cat, helped her with her business, we’ve done a lot. We are always the one’s who are there to help because we can‘t bring ourselves to not answer the call.\n\nAnd she doesn’t even seem to care what’s going on in our lives. It is pretty clear overall that she doesnt actually value us as friends.\n\nIt is so frustrating to watch her keep doing the same thing over and over again. She is immature. And after the last time(another time she had to move out of her boyfriends house who we told her she should not be with, and most DEFINITELY not move in with), my boyfriend and I knew that we needed to set a boundary with her because the stress of her puts a lot of strain on both of our mental health. \n\nSo we talked about what we needed to say and we planned to have dinner at her house and after her son went to bed, we told her we needed to have a serious conversation. We told her that we care about her and her son, but we can’t watch them keep going through this same song and dance. Basically made it clear that if this happens again, we will always be a safe place for Gus to land, he will always have a safe place to stay with us and that if she needs more help with him to be able to vet people by going out with them away from her son, we can do that, but we can’t keep helping her the way we have because it doesn’t seem to actually be helping. Essentially outlining that we are not coming to her rescue next time. At this point, it feels like enabling. We wrote a letter to leave with her about things that we are not saying to make sure she doesnt think we think she’s a bad person, because we don’t. Immature, yes, but not a bad person. \n\nObviously she didnt take it well, pretty much just shut down and wouldnt respond. So we said our piece, left the letter and went home.\n\nPersonally, I felt like we really tried to approach the situation in a kind and respectful way, but I could be wrong. But ever since then, she’s definitely been mad at us and accused my boyfriend of ”being combative” towards her lately. Which to me just feels like she’s upset that we’re not just doing whatever she wants us to do or agreeing with everything she says. \n\nI’m so at a loss at this point. My boyfriend and I are on the same page of just being so done with her behavior. But we love this kid as if he were our own and we just want him to have a safe and healthy childhood, and it’s hard when she’s doing things in direct opposition of that. What can we even do? Are we making it worse? She is a big stressor in our lives and if it were just her, I would not still be friends with her. But she and Gus are a package deal. How can we keep reasonable boundaries while still having access to the child care about? I fear that she will grow frustrated with us not doing/saying what she wants and then we will not be a part of his life as much as we would like to be.\n\nAny advice or constructive criticism is appreciated. Thank you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR- My boyfriend and I(29m and 26f) love a child(8m) whose mother(29f) is a difficult person to be around and it’s causing us a lot of stress. How can we keep reasonable boundaries while also continuing to have access to the child we love?",

        "text": "This is kind of a long story, please feel free to ask if I need to clarify anything. \n\nI am originally from Boston, MA. I left about seven years ago to jump around and explore different places to live. I've lived in a few different places, but wound up more or less settling in Kansas City. I say I settled here because of a good job and cost-of-living and all the normal reasons, but I think the real truth is I settled down because I fell in love. I met my husband here four years ago, and we married six months ago. I can't say for certain if I would have stayed otherwise or not, but at least at the time I met him I was convinced I was happy and would be down to stay here forever. \n\nAs for my husband, he is originally from here, but moved around a lot as well before coming back shortly before I met him, and he is happy here. He's got a good job, friends, family, and a long history here. He has also been a really great partner to me. \n\nBut, apparently out of nowhere I am starting to have doubts about staying here forever. We have started talking about buying a home at some point in the near future, so I don't know if that is what is triggering it, but it has definitely brought these feelings to the front of my mind. \n\nJust over the last month or two I have started to have a longing feeling to return to Boston. I know it is dumb and irrational, but I've just suddenly really started to miss where I am from. Now I can't manage to make myself happy about the prospects of buying a home here or staying here permanently. \n\nSo I really want to move back, but can't really even articulate a specific reason.   \n\nBut I also feel like asking to move back is really unfair to my husband. He has worked really hard to help build a life for us here in Kansas City, plus he has professional licenses that may be difficult to move states (I'm not really sure how hard). I've always told him I was happy here (because I thought I was), but did not expect to suddenly get this really powerful feeling of homesickness for some reason. \n\nWould it be totally spoiled of me to ask my husband to uproot himself to go back to the East Coast with me?\n\nI feel like some spoiled brat to expect him to do that kind of thing for me, but it is what I want right this moment and I am worried I'll have a hard time being happy here if I let him go forward on buying a house when I am feeling this way. \n\n**TL;DR:** I am building a life with my husband in Kansas City, but have developed a powerful longing to return home. Is it ridiculous for me to ask my husband to uproot and move with me back to the East Coast.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/11o40nu/i_mtf21_have_struggles_communicating_my_problems/",
        "text": "Firstly, let me preface this post with the fact that I absolutely adore my boyfriend. He is nothing but uplifting and supportive to me and he's the love of my life. Any time I get to spend hearing his voice or even just texting him I feel the happiest I can be. Heck, I can't even remember the last time, or any times at all, that we've ever argued. Even though we're long distance, we've been together for three years, friends for... around six or seven years before that, and I only want to go forward.  \n\n\nAs to our actual conflict, I'm an insecure emotional wreck. This is the first (consensual/genuine) relationship I've been in, and even if it doesn't end up lasting forever I still want it to be fruitful. There's a lot of things I struggle with, and I frequently just end up bottling it up and trying to stomach it, but it keeps leading to nights where I just end up breaking down.   \n\n\nI know I should just share it with him, after all we're a couple, we're supposed to share each others burdens and he's always able to communicate when something bothers him, but I just can't bring myself to. Every time I try, I get into a mental state where I just convince myself that I'm shoveling my problems onto him, that he doesn't deserve to have to put up with my baggage and that I'm just an unnecessary burden. I'm sure it sounds stupid to think like that, but with how he's always so frequently drained from the job he's had from the past year, I don't want to add onto his exhaustion or muddy his better/free days with my emotional problems.  \n\n\nOn top of that, I always have this creeping feeling that I'm just holding him down from pursuing a more fulfilling relationship. Every time he tells me that I'm everything he could ever ask for, I can never take it at face value. There's nothing about him that would lead him to think cruelly of me, and even though I'm certain that he does genuinely mean it, I still end up convinced it's all a lie just to make me feel better. My brain keeps telling me that because I'm not a 'real woman', I'll never satisfy him and I'll always have parts of me that make me repulsive and unfulfilling (this is NOT something I genuinely or would ever believe/say of other trans folk, this is entirely my own crippling lack of self esteem from things I've been told of myself in the past).   \n\n\nI feel like I'm just not hearing the right specific thing I need to cement his words for me. At the same time, I also wonder if maybe he's just too worried about saying something that'll tick off something I'm sensitive or uncomfortable about. In particular, I worry that I might have instilled that myself by accident.   \n\n\nFor context, he knows I'm somewhere on the asexual spectrum and understands I have my own troubles standing up for myself—and there have been times in the past where I had showed that I was intimidated or sounded as if I felt pressured into indulging him sexually—but I really do trust him a lot and feel comfortable with him, I have not once allowed him to make me do anything that I didn't decide I also wanted to do.   \n\n\nAdditionally, I don't know if I'm supposed to divulge into why I'm so sensitive and averse to sex? I wonder if telling him what it is specifically that triggers my discomforts and bad memories would help him understand me better so that we could work together. Considering that he's someone with a higher libido, I don't want him to be left unsatisfied just because of my own struggles and traumas. Hell, even worse, I'd hate it if we ever did end up splitting up and he'd be left with his own kind of intimidation toward approaching intimacy.   \n\n\nI worry that this is all long winded, but I just sincerely want to know. I don't know how to communicate any of this to my boyfriend.   \n\n\nWhat I'm specifically asking for is, how do I approach telling him that despite his praise and affection I still ultimately end up feeling like I'm not worth it for him and I want to hear his most wholehearted and earnest words?   \n\n\nAm I even supposed to share the trauma that's left me scarred since it's already so distant in the past and out of place?   \n\n\nHow do I begin a conversation like this without it coming out of left field or sounding overwhelming?  \n\n\nShould I even bite the bullet and burden him with all this in the first place?  \n\n\nI don't know, but it all just really bothers me and when it festers in my head for too long I end up feeling as alone and pained as I would without a partner. He wouldn't want that for me, and I want to be better for him.  \n\n\nTL;DR: I'm constantly worried about sharing my problems with my boyfriend because I don't want to further contribute to any of his stress because of his job, but I also think I understand that regardless a relationship works best when both sides are able to communicate with each other and that we'll be better off if that is the case. How do I approach sensitive topics, or should I just avoid it altogether if he's stressed?",

        "text": "I feel so broken. My husband of 15 years, been together 25 did something that really upset me a month and a half ago, and instead of apologizing, he has been acting like I don't exist..(which is the cycle in our marriage, it happens almost every month) not talking to me, acknowledging me..just spending all of his time with our kids until there a huge blow up and we rencile after months and months of this treatment.\n\nWell, one of our daughter's friends mom is a widow. My husband has jokingly said in the past that if anything happens to me that she can be his sugar mama as she has a full time job and a house and I'm a stay at home mom with no income coming in.\n\nWell, we're at a soccer game the other day and our daughters (mine and the daughter of widow )are playing in the gym. I'm sitting next to my husband on the bleachers and we're not talking. I look over and he's texting the mom asking if she was able to make it (she wasn't there yet). I flipped out, demanded to see the phone and its a bunch of texts.\n\nSome background..our daughter went over for a playdate a couple weeks ago and my husband picked her up. They didn't come home for an hour, even though they live 10 minutes away. When I asked my daughter why it took so long, she said that the girls didn't want to stop playing and that my husband and the mom were in the kitchen talking.\n\nA week after that, we had her daughter here for a playdate. That night, husband texted a picture of our dog in the snow as he was taking her for a walk saying \" See, this is what you have to deal with when you have a dog lolol\" and then they were texting about that.\n\nThere were like 15 texts back and forth that I could see and a smiley a face from her that seemed to be in response to something he said that I think he quickly deleted before handing me the phone. I was SO upset and in the middle of a crowded gym so I really couldn't absorb everything. I know there was nothing sexual.\n\nI am so upset about this as I consider it cheating, but he is saying I'm crazy. He hasn't spoken to me in months, he's sitting next to me on the bleachers texting this woman as I'm sitting there. I feel so hurt, emotionally violated and disrespected.\n\nTl; dr: Am I being crazy or is this completely unacceptable behavior?\n\nEdit - she's been a widow for 2 years",

        "text": "Me and my partner have been together for 8 years. When we first started dating he was always telling me how beautiful I was, and how much he loved me and my body. That stopped after a year or two. I have gained some weight since then and would be considered more so on the chubby side now, but not a drastic difference from before. I think he is the most handsome guy and I say this to him and I tell him every day. \n\nA conversation we have had multiple times on our relationship is that I am a person who needs reassurance. Whenever I say this to him and say sometimes I just need to hear that you're still attracted to me, I am met with comments like \"stop fishing for compliments\" or \"I don't like being told what to say\". He thinks that my insecurities are the reason I need reassurance and that my insecurities are not his problem and so he won't feed them. \n\nThis would be fine if I didn't see the way he reacts when he sees a pretty girl on Instagram or sees a girl around. He will turn to me and so readily say \"oh she's cute\" or \"she's so pretty\". I can't help but wonder why he won't say that stuff to me about me? He will say I look cute, but only if I get dolled up and ask him \"do I look cute?\" And even then his reply is normally through a sigh and he sounds annoyed. I don't think he has called me beautiful or pretty in the last 7 years, it's always a reluctant \"cute\". There have been a few instances where he has told me I looked good days after the fact \"you looked so cute in that dress last week\", and I can't help think why won't he say that at the time? He sometimes jokes that he has to keep my self esteem low so I don't leave him, but sometimes I wonder how much truth is in that. \n\nI'm starting to think he just doesn't find me attractive anymore, and if I bring it up he will get mad again saying I'm \"fishing\". Am I being over dramatic? Is it just my insecurities? I know I'm not super good looking but it's important my partner finds me attractive. \n\nTLDR: my partner is very reluctant to compliment my looks even when I told him I'm someone that needs reassurance. I'm starting to wonder if he's not attracted to me anymore.",

        "text": "It's been 9 months since my ex broke up with me; it was my first relationship, we were together for almost 3 years, and I still feel incredibly hurt with what she did 5 months ago the last time we probably will ever talk. I just feel like I got done dirty.\n\nFor context, said ex wasn't/isn't a very confrontational person. I don't know if its because she's avoidant or anything but she really doesn't like calling things out until it's too late? Essentially I still had contact with my ex for a few months talking about my grievances. We both became pen pals, and just talked of the things we grieved about. I knew deep down we shouldn't have kept in contact but it just felt nice being heard; I did ask for her to just straight up block me before, and all she said was \"I'll always be here if you need it\", and I somewhat trusted her for it.\n\nOf course, I didn't take it at face value, and made sure to unadd her and add her to make sure she's okay with it since that was the deal between us, but I still messaged her every 1-2 months about just something specific to just try move on, and eventually I became confident I did after 4 months, and wanted to message her one last time in a way? It's kind of stupid but I just wanted a last word with her. I thought we were actually in friendly terms so I sent her a friend request, she accepted it again, and texted with her for a few days.\n\nEventually, our talk reached the peak and I sent a really long rant about how \"we both deserve better and no one was really to blame\" and at that point she questioned me, and what my \"true objective\" was messaging me this much and suddenly became dismissive once I tried to explain things, screenshotted our texts, and just got blocked with her last words being \"I got nothing else to say to you\". It was honestly a bit sad but..\n\n...like a few hours later, after being sad about it her best friend adds me, and messages me? And it was one of the most vile things I've read and it genuinely affected me for awhile :( Like I get the blocking but the words after was unnecessarily cruel, and clued in a lot of things my ex did wasn't particularly genuine post break-up.\n\nTo summarize the text her best friend sent, I essentially get called out for why I kept messaging my ex the last few months, and that the reason why she's here instead of my ex because said ex has better things to do, that I'm already an adult, I should've used my brain power to fix the relationship before we broke up, to move on and get called creepy at least more than I should've been in a row.\n\nAlso gone on a long tirade about how much of a \"queen\" my ex is, how delusional I am thinking that I'd ever be in a friendship/relationship with her again, that she'd rather kill herself than that ever happening, and that she's in a healthier/better relationship with someone else already. She went for the kill bruhh 😭 I didn't know, I deleted her off everywhere and our universities aren't the same.\n\nNot going to lie what hurt the most wasn't about her being in the new relationship or anything, it's the fact they thought I still wanted to be with her again. It held my progress a bit since it made me question like did I actually miss her? It almost felt like I got gaslighted. It was a weird feeling and I just felt embarrassed.\n\nOf course now I know, I definitely didn't, but I thought she was going on some psychology thing where you're attracted back to your ex subconsciously? Like I'm actually just lying to myself, and questioned that. I honestly can't get it. I don't really know who to blame; even though I could blame my ex, I mostly blame myself like I should've honestly known better, but I still didn't deserve that. The worse thing is it held me back for a few more months and only recently did I start dating(trying) again. I'm still hurt by it but I still can't bring to hate my ex for it since it's clear it would've made anyone uncomfortable. She should've at least communicated well than growing resentment again or I guess it's always been a problem :( Made me learn the hard way why r/UnsentLetters exists.\n\nTL;DR - got ousted as a weirdo by messaging my ex infrequently every couple months since I felt hurt, and then getting verbally abused by her best friend instead which affects me to this day. I don't know how to take the L properly but don't want to associate with my ex ever again. How do I properly take care of the hurt and embarrassment so I don't have additional luggage when in a new relationship?",

        "text": "This is a throwaway account, but I really appreciate any input. I feel like I'm at a weird stage of my life where I'm kinda jaded and broken, so I don't always trust my judgment...\n\nSome background: I \\[34F\\] am at a place where I have actively chosen to be single and stop dating. I truly have no desire to be in a relationship , and I don't want kids so nothing to worry about there. I'm not against something casual, or even a relationship if the right man came into my life, but I am SO much happier on my own, doing my own thing and not being accountable to anyone.\n\nSo, now: I met a guy \\[39M\\] through Instagram (we both run similar creator accounts), and he caught my eye as someone I was VERY attracted to. I'm really picky, so this is rare for me. He and I live in different states, but we started flirting more and more until I finally gave him my phone number and snapchat a few weeks ago. I was excited to have a little fun but since then, things have gotten... confusing.\n\nWe both were VERY clear that neither of us is looking for a relationship, just something casual and to have a little fun. But I feel like it's not playing out that way at all. The problem is that I don't know if I'm just a stick in the mud/too protective of my time, or if he's crossing the line.\n\nIn the beginning, it was really fun to snapchat and get a little more than PG rated. Turns out he is coming to my city next month, which I was really excited about, and we talked about how I could be his tour guide and we even discussed whether he could stay with me if things were going well.\n\nBut lately I've been getting the major ICK. It's three main things, I guess:\n\nFirst, his communication screams \"relationship.\" I literally even called him out and said that I feel like he's trying to fill a void in his life with how much he wants to talk. This man snapchats me ALL. DAY. LONG. EVERY. SINGLE. DAY. Long ass videos telling me stories about his day. Plus texts. And DMs. All of it. Non stop. Even when I don't respond for hours! There's always a good morning, always a good night. Always asking what I'm up to. Always telling me details about his day, like what he's doing and eating.\n\nHe has also started operating under the assumption that we should talk daily. Every night, it's \"let me know if you're free to talk.\" During the day it's, \"we can talk more about this tonight.\" I feel SO SMOTHERED that now I'm just annoyed every time I get a notification, and the last thing I want to do is talk to this man. I'm so turned off by it!! It also doesn't help that I feel like he's always just lying shirtless in his bed. At first I was like okayyyy hottie, but now I'm like dude can you not sit upright and get some hobbies? He DOES go to the gym daily and does blogging and stuff, but other than that he's always seemingly in bed just waiting for me.\n\nWhich brings me to point #2, which is something that ebbs and flows by the day. Some days, I am incredibly impressed by this guy's emotional openness and ability to be vulnerable and thoughtful. He sent me a handwritten card in the mail that was incredible touching. And he asked about my flower preferences, which like, no man has done ever lol.\n\nBut other days, I feel like we live on two different planets. I work at a prestigious company in corporate America (I'm a former biglaw attorney), and he works in a warehouse managerial-type role in a southern state. I am absolutely NOT snooty about education and careers, but I'm starting to wonder if there is a genuine IQ gap that I can't see past. honestly feel like I'm talking past this man sometimes. When the conversation turns to anything but sex and food, I find it incredibly unfulfilling, and I'm REALLY confused by what he gets out of it. He has made comments that he really admires my intellect and vocabulary and loves listening to me speak, which is flattering, but it's EXHAUSTING. Like, not only does he want to talk all the time, but the burden is totally on me to entertain him, it seems.\n\nThat brings me to #3, which I definitely think I have some fault in. Since our \"relationship\" started off based on physical attraction, I was very open to the aforementioned not-PG snapchats at first. But it has begun to feel like that is all this man wants to talk about. I'll be talking about something serious or something stressing me out, and his solution is a sexual gesture. He sends me sexual things throughout the day because he thinks it'll bring a smile to my face. And every live conversation turns to how he's so turned on by me and he can't wait to get physical. It's sex, sex, sex ALL THE TIME.\n\nI guess I'm just trying to figure out what the hell is going on here. When this started, I was TOTALLY down for casual and physical only. However, I thought that would mean some flirty texts here and there and talking MAYBE once a week. Now, it has become this thing where I feel like I am dating him and accountable to him at all times.\n\nI really don't want to be a jerk to this guy, because I do think he means well and he is REALLY sweet, sex talk aside. I just don't know how to get my feelings across in a way that make sense and aren't hurtful to him. He can be really sweet and encouraging, and he always says he \"gets it\" and \"no worries\" when I tell him I'm busy. But then he goes right back into puppy mode and keeps me up every day.\n\nIs there a way I can clearly and kindly set boundaries? I don't want to like, stomp on a puppy, but is there any way to get the point across or is it a pointless endeavor? The fact that he's coming to my city is also looming... I definitely think we could have a good time together for a weekend, but I really don't want to put this much effort into this every day.\n\nI also would love validation that I'm not just an asshole or there's something wrong with me. I'm sure a lot of women who would LOVE a no-string-attached situationship where the guy is sweet and doting and hot. It makes me feel like there is just something wrong with me that I am this frustrated...\n\nThoughts, advice, insights?!\n\nTL;DR: Am I prickly pear who just shouldn't date at all, or is this guy crossing the line?",

        "text": "I (19F) have been dating (19M) for 9 months. We live\ntogether at his parent's house.\n\nI freelance act and model when I have free time outside\nof college. For fun, I do stand-up comedy at a few\nvenues throughout our region/county.\n\nThrough stand-up, I've made a lot of friends. I'm not\ntight-knit with them or anything, but we bond over it a lot\nand sometimes go out for pizza after shows.\n\nOne guy in particular (M41) hosts his own comedy show\nthat I perform at every two weeks. He gives me a lot of\nfeedback on my material and has helped me learn how to\nhost my own show. He also films short skits online for\nfun. He has a great camera setup too. He is single and\nhas no children.\n\nMy boyfriend (19M) is incredibly jealous whenever he\n(M41) communicates with me. My boyfriend hardly\nwants him around me and I've had to practically beg him\nnot to make a scene or be disrespectful to him at our\nshows. I've explained many times that I'm not interested\nin him, and that I love the man I chose. My boyfriend\nthinks he is flirting with me or wants to be intimate, but\n(M41) has this excited flirty jokey personality and acts\nthe same way with everyone. I've tried explaining this to\nmy boyfriend, but he still doesn't like it.\n\nI've booked two auditions for short films. They have to be\nself-taped at home. (M41) lives alone and has many\nspaces to film these tapes. He has acting experience and\ncould be the reader (Other person I need to interact with in the script) for the scenes.\n\nBefore even contacting (M41) to ask for his help, I told\nmy boyfriend that I was going to ask for his help, and I\ntold him that he could come watch because he doesn't\nwant me alone with this other guy. My boyfriend offered\nto be the reader for me, but I explained to him that he\nisn't a strong public speaker (I often have difficulty\nhearing him), and that he doesn't have acting experience.\nI also explained that (M41) knows how to film properly,\nand that there are clips that would need one of his tripods or something. He was still upset and tried to make any possible alternative to asking him; promising\nto perfectly memorize the lines, speaking clearly, etc. I\ntold him that these auditions are important to me, and\nthey need to be the best quality they can be. I promised\nhim that he can be there to supervise. He felt better, and\ntold me I have to let him know as soon as I find out schedules and that it has to work out so that he can be there.\n\nToday, I got a response from (M41). He is going to help\nme with the scenes. Unfortunately, I found out that the\naudition tapes are due on March 12th. (M41) is still able\nto help, but after talking to my boyfriend, there isn't a\ntime that works to film that would allow my boyfriend to\nbe there. I asked (M41) if tonight would work, so that I\ncould have my boyfriend there (I didn't mention that it\nwas because of my boyfriend). Unfortunately it didn't\nwork for (M41). I explained to my boyfriend that we will\nhave to film tomorrow. He said \"I don't care what the\ncircumstances are, I don't want you hanging out with ___ alone\". I keep trying to reassure him that everything is going to be strictly platonic, and that this is important for my acting career. He just keeps saying \"You're not going\" and that I messed up and that I'm making him worry which is affecting him at work.\n\nI personally feel like I shouldn't allow his jealousy make\nme miss opportunities in my acting career.\n\nTLDR: I have to film audition tapes and I seeked out a\nmale friend to help me with it. My boyfriend is extremely\nupset, and is demanding that I don't do it. I'm still\nplanning on going anyway.",

        "text": "\nMy brother is on the low functioning end of the autism. This causes a lot of problems in terms of building friendships.\nIt’s painful to watch him get hurt again and again. Time and time again he makes friends online and the friendships fall apart because of his inability to understand boundaries or peoples intentions. People get frustrated of his inability to understand and thus respect their boundaries. And he often misunderstands peoples intents and becomes hostile in the moment (he had a bad friend as a kid that makes him paranoid and causes outbursts by certain triggers as he assumes people who set off those triggers are hostile). He’s taken medication which reduces the problem, but it doesn’t eliminate it entirely. \n\nI don’t blame them for not wanting to be friends with him. He can be a lot at times. \n\nBut one former friend went way too far recently and tried to coax him into committing suicide as a form of “payback” for when he yelled at her a few weeks ago after she accidentally set off a trigger. Told him the only way he could redeem himself and not hurt anyone ever again is by dying. I learned about this when I saw him holding and staring at a knife and he told me what happened and how he was thinking about cutting his throat. \n\nHe’s thought about suicide many times before because of his frustration with his condition and inability to maintain friendships. Often referred to himself as a “living error”. So it pisses me off to no end she would suggest that. I want to fucking beat the shit out of her. Worst part is this was a friend he thought highly of and was on good terms with for over a year. So I think he may genuinely be considering ending his life because of what she said. Now I don’t know what to do.\n\n\nTLDR: former friend of my brother tried to coax him into suicide. I think he may be considering it.",

        "text": "I've always been incredibly slow to make friends. The only person I've ever really connected with long-term was \"Anna\" \\[19 f\\]. We've been close friends for about three years, and although I know we're growing together as adults, sometimes I feel like she doesn't really respect me. \n\nFor context, she's white, upperclass, and conservative and I'm Black, lower-middle class, and left-leaning. She identifies as an independent, but I say she leans conservative because she only supports republicans and conservative policy (she was a big Trump supporter back then, but doesn't really speak on him as much anymore lol). Obviously I'm not one to care much about politics. If it was a problem, I would've avoided her those years ago. But earlier in out relationship, she'd say things that just didn't sit right with me. \n\nFor example: when she was applying to college, she was rejected from her first choice uni while a Black student (this student was also my friend) was accepted. Anna complained to me that this student only got in because she was Black, that she didn't deserve the school, that she had awful grades, etc, etc. I just sort of listened awkwardly because I wasn't sure what to say. Then, Anna said that I should just apply to any top school because they'd accept me. This really struck a chord with me. I've been in academic programs all my life, programs which were the only reason I was attending the same private high school as her. It just felt like a slap in the face for all the sacrifices I made and continue to make for my education. I go to a top school now, but sometimes I wonder if she thinks my race is the only reason I'm here. \n\nExample 2: There was a time we were just casually talking about dating, preferences, etc. She told me that she would never date a Black man, and that she'd only finds white and asian men attractive. I completely understand that everyone has their preferences, but the way she said this kind of got to me. Maybe it's just me, but I get a bit uncomfortable when people describe their \"type\" using only racial markers. I.e., \"I only like asian women,\" \"I don't like people with big lips,\" \"I don't like big noses\", \"I only date Black men.\" It's just a bit strange to me and her telling me that made me feel weird. Side note: She was dating an asian guy but after they broke up, she confuses her ex with every other asian guy at her school. \n\nI know this makes her sound pretty bad, and I agree that she can be a bit racially insensitive. However, I feel she is a good person, and she's the only one outside of my family I feel I can be myself around. Sometimes I feel like most of the blame is on me because I don't say anything, so much so that she feels comfortable saying these things to me despite my very obvious racial identity. It's just that I've struggled with anxiety for the last 7 or so years (high school was rlly horrible), so I walk on eggshells around her so that she doensn't stop being my friend. Another note: she has been known to cut people off for doing similar things. We do have a VERY good relationship - just when these issues aren't brought up lol.\n\n**I guess my question is: how should I approach this? I feel like I'm looking for problems when she doesn't say stuff like that around me as much anymore. Should I just leave it alone and hope that part of her changes?** \n\nTLDR: My only friend can be racially insensitive which makes me, a Black woman, uncomfortable sometimes. I'm not sure if I should just carry on as is and hope it subsides, or if I should muster the courage to talk about it at the risk of losing her as a friend. \n\nThis was *really* long - Sorry!",

The doctors are almost certain that I have cancer. Yes. Cancer. I'm absolutely terrified.
