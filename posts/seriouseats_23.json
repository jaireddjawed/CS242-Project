Should I take the shoulder out of the oven or score the skin or will it be okay?\n\nAlso at the end of the recipe it says that you have to rotate the shoulder every five minutes, does that mean spin the baking tray or flip the shoulder (from top to bottom to side etc)?",

        "text": "So let me stipulate right front, I completely spaced out on taking a picture. Total fail on my part, so very sorry for that. \n\nHaving said that, I just tried making [Kenji's Toaster Oven Salmon](http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2012/06/miso-glazed-salmon-in-the-toaster-oven-recipe.html) and wanted to offer a few thoughts. \n\nFirst, it was absolutely delicious, and cooking it could not have been simpler. I've always found salmon to be a little fussy to cook in a pan. Sometimes it comes out perfect, and sometimes (likely owing to a combination of lack of skill/experience on my part, and the general difficulty of perfectly cooking fish) it's just way off. \n\nSo when I found this recipe, it was definitely something I was willing to try, and was really pleased with the results. The fish developed a nice caramelized crust, and was a perfect temp all the way through and cooked evenly to boot. \n\nA couple of notes on the recipe: \n\n1. I made a few substitutions to the marinade out of necessity/laziness. I'm in Chicago, and although high quality asian ingredients are certainly available if you're willing to go to the right place, I didn't really feel like doing that after work, and just swung by the mexican grocery store across the street. So instead of sake, I used shao hsing rice wine, and instead of miso paste I substituted green curry paste. I also more or less eyeballed all the marinade ingredients, since I was only preparing a single portion. \n\n2. Kenji's recipe specifies 5 minutes in the oven, but acknowledged a lot of variance from toaster to toaster. It took me more like 8-9. I pulled it out at 112F, and after resting it was a perfect med-rare. \n\n3. My salmon came with skin on, and I cooked it skin side down. And predictably, sitting on the aluminum foil and moist from the marinade, the skin just turned to mush and I didn't end up serving it. If I were to do it again, I would definitely remove the skin in advance and crisp it in the oven separately. \n\n4. I served the fish with some simple asparagus with garlic and lemon. Simple but classic. \n\nDefinitely a recipe I plan to cook again, and recommend for anyone looking for a simple and reliable method!\n\n",

I am currently dry aging some ducks in my walk in at work and I want to roast the whole things...  the rest of the dish will evolve, as I am only on week 1 of hopefully a 2 week dry aging process.\n\nI am here to ask suggestions on how to cook the duck.  Do I need to score and render the breast first before roasting?  Or just pop the whole thing right in a hot oven? Would the legs be edible or too tough? I think I have only ever braised or confited duck legs in the past.\n\nI have also done this with just the breast on the cage a long time ago at another restaurant, but to be honest I didn't have much to do with the process and was not entirely familiar with it.  I just know we did it.  It was funky, and fatty and delicious, but don't remember anything on the actual process.\n\nAny suggestions? Anyone do this before? I am posting here because a) I just stumbled upon this subreddit and b) I absolutely love kenji and serious eats. My go to on recipes and the reasons they work.",

It's one of your worst, and it calls for an egregious egg enquiry! \n\nI took it upon myself to complete the recipe using a 3, 4, and 5 minute time in the boiling water, and documented the results. \n\n[Here are my photos.](https://photos.app.goo.gl/amMEKZ58DczXzHVU2)\n\nNotes:\n\n- 3 Minutes - only half the whites are set, the rest are \"soupy clouds\" and not particularly appetizing.\n- 4 minutes - unset whites almost gone but still detectable.\n- 5 minutes - whites fully set, but still very flexible (very different texture from a hard boiled egg)\n\nPersonally I wouldn't eat the 3 minute egg, the 4s were borderline, and the 5s were great. The magic number at least for me is between 4 and 5 minutes.",

I would prefer not to have a cloud of cornbread resting over a small pool of chili.\n\nI also do not have a cast-iron skillet large enough to cook this in. Would replacing it with a dutch oven or baking dish yield similar results? I suspect that the crust wouldn't get *as* crisp around the edges but I don't mind as long as it cooks and rises evenly. \n\nLastly, for those who have made the cornbread before, do you find it to be rather sweet or more savory? I'm curious because I'd like to have a contrasting flavor to compliment the spicy and smokey nature of the chorizo without it being cloyingly sweet. If it's on the sweeter side I thought about offsetting that with a jalapeno or serrano diced into the batter. \n\nThanks in advance, happy cooking! :)",

But most of the Internet is obsessed with the Instant Pot and those recipes (like [this one](http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2014/01/quick-easy-pressure-cooker-chicken-and-chickpea-masala.html#comments-32353)) just say \"high pressure\" or \"low pressure.\"  What PSI do you use for high and low pressure?  \n\n(Also, the instruction book says to use 12.0 for meats but 9.0 for chicken...)",
