I struggled to connect with them because I never really connected with them back then. Of course, I was interacting with a lot of them, asking about their life, jumping in on conversations, etc. But the longer the night went on, the harder it was getting for me to be social (drinks + my social battery running out). \n\nEventually, I was just kind of standing around while everyone around me laughed and drank. I didn't feel awkward about it, so I didn't seek anyone out to connect with--I was just very tired and wanted to be still (or sleep - but my partner was having a good time connecting with everyone). \n\nAt a certain point, this friend of my friend came up to me and kind of made a \"stink face\" at me playfully. I like this person and always want to connect with them more, but they are very extroverted and always running around talking to people, and I'm just not usually that type. So I questioned why they made that face at me and he said \"that's you.\" I laughed and apologized, saying sorry if I have RBF because that's not how I feel at all. \n\nHe tried to banter with me a bit and made a comment about me being aggressive. It was kind of playful, and I was playful back, so I think it was just a silly way for him to try to break the ice with me, but it kind of snapped me into reality. \n\nI've been told I come off as intimidating in the past - but then people get to know me and they realize I'm soft as hell. I just feel bad about how many people I might've turned off by my general aura and outward projections (whether it be what I say, how I say it, how I look, etc.) \n\nI genuinely LOVE building close connections with others, it's just hard for me to feel comfortable with people. \n\nAny advice?",

I didn’t want my social awkwardness to hold me back from being around people, so I squeezed myself into a group that I’d hope would at least deal with me. And it just feels so much worst. It’s honestly draining that I put in so much effort to fit into a friend group. Just to be accepted, just to have a bit of that validation I crave all the time. \n\nIs it my energy? I feel like I drive people away with my bubbly personality. Not to mention I’m an absolute chatter box when I’m comfortable around people, but I’m self aware enough not to talk over others or rudely cut them off. I like to make sure everyones included since I don’t get the same treatment.\n\nI have a fear of being excluded (also known as FOMO). Whenever i hear about an event that I wasn’t present in, it feels like I missed out on a good bonding experience with friends, and that forms anxiety overtime for me. \n\nI tend to catch myself over-engaging in conversation because I have this assumption in my head that if I’m not speaking, I’m not visible or acknowledged. \n\nIt seems like everyone has found themselves. Since I’ve been in the group, I’ve notice that most of them are very…advanced? Everyone seems to have deep interests involving art, historic novels, psychology, etc. And I’m just there, fixated on simple things like Nintendo. I love learning the new things they talk about and I force myself to get into it, but those type of interests has layers. And my adhd brain just doesn’t have that attention span. I just don’t feel interesting enough to keep a conversation with.\n\nI keep draining myself to be a people pleaser and it’s really putting a mental affect on me. The best decision is to leave, but I’m scared of starting over the progress I have with them.",

But I’ve noticed there’s definitely a selection process that goes into it for most. Here’s the situation: I’m engaged and was out getting drinks with my fiancé and some work acquaintances. My fiancé was there beside me. A female work acquaintance who I chat with in passing every blue moon, but don’t know much about, was across from us. My fiancé doesn’t know her at all. The acquaintance mentioned she had never tried a Manhattan before but she got the restaurant’s version of it, which was not the real deal (unnecessary additives). I told her that’s my favorite drink, I used to bartend, and the one on their menu wasn’t the traditional, best version. Normal chit chat. Then I ordered a custom Manhattan in the traditional style. I know my fiancé doesn’t like manhattans, so I didn’t offer her a sip. I wanted to offer the acquaintance a sip of my drink, to show her what a real Manhattan tastes like. Is that weird? Does that involve showing too much interest in this female acquaintance? Is there a specific criteria you use to discern who to share a drink with, especially when it’s a member of the opposite sex? \n\nThanks for any insight!",

        "text": "**I'm 25 right now and I'm honestly stuck on which path to take within \\~2 years.**\n\nI'm working full-time entry-level at \\~70k/year right now, but I should be able to move to six figures fast within two years' time. Ideally, even way higher as I job hop, negotiate, and work in a US job remotely.\n\nI've been sheltered and lived with my religious family (I'm an agnostic atheist) my whole life. I lived for maybe like 8 months with a sibling close to my university just to try it out and that's it. I just isolated myself though for most of it.\n\nBasically, if my life was a stock, career and finances are booming, and social stock has crashed. Zero friends besides a once in a blue moon hang-out.\n\nIn terms of friends, it MAY or may not lead anywhere even if I live alone. In fact, while I will make the effort &amp; work towards curating my social life, I'm being realistic and not expecting anything.\n\n**So here are my options by the time I'm 27. Either:**\n\n**(1) Choose to stay home &amp; Rent out a Condo:** Save up for another year of work (by 28) then buy a cheaper condo (150-200k) as real estate &amp; rent it out while continuing to live with family &amp; saving up. Focus on work, finances, staying social with family &amp; that's it. I've lived like this my whole life anyways.\n\n**Pros:** Likely more money faster (condo plus money saved on rent).\n\n**Cons:** Stunted growth, Less chances with social life, Staying in my bubble.\n\n**(2) Move out and rent a place:** Moving to the US for potentially better pay by being there \"in-person\", renting a place, and aiming to move somewhere that gives me the best chances of curating a good social life with people who match my personality and with less family influence (religious).\n\n**Pros:** Potentially better chances with social life, room for growth &amp; being fully responsible for myself (and would still have that family social net if shit hits the fan for whatever reason).\n\n**Cons:** Money lost on rent costs  (unless working in-person in the US can offset those costs), Less money and/or energy to invest (since I'd be focused on surviving), and Family social net lessened.\n\n**(3) Buy a Condo, Live in it &amp; Maybe Rent it out Later:** Save up for another year of work (by 28) then buy a cheaper condo (150-200k) as real estate &amp; choosing to live in it for however long I want. I can then decide to continue staying, move back home, or live somewhere else while renting it out.\n\n**Pros:** Good money made potentially but less than choosing to stay home, Family is close by (parents, and married siblings who live maybe 1-2 hours away), Slightly better chances with social life (but it's an hour away from home at most so still many considerations).\n\n**Cons:** It's a middle ground of everything (which could be a good thing but also means it's not as much of a fresh start and there are still limitations and less odds of social success but it does give more breathing room), Money lost on utilities &amp; Wouldn't be getting like $500 profit per month from rent.\n\n**I'm totally lost on which path to take and feel like outside advice could be helpful.** I feel more mature and now I'm getting my shit together more as well (consistent job with better pay, eating healthier and portioning, managing my finances better, taking charge of certain issues or things that need to be fixed at the home, and getting my last license since I can drive but just not in highways).\n\nBut, like I mentioned, I feel like my growth has been stunted from living at home and I'm concerned about the long-term impact of doing so. Additionally, I feel that curating a long-term community, and social life will be constrained as well. Not to say that my family isn't great and I haven't met people through them, but it's mainly putting on that \"religious son\" mask, rather than being true to myself.\n\nI feel like I lack the experience to decide whether it's worthwhile to seriously pursue marriage or certain types of social circles. I don't know how far my introvertedness goes and I also want to test my own sanity and groundedness without the ability to have family and everything read for me most of the time without working for it. Like a social life, house responsibilities dealt with etc.\n\n**TLDR; I'm 25, been sheltered and at a cross-road of three options to take within the next two years or so. Choose to stay home while renting out a condo, Moving out and renting a place, or buying a Condo &amp; living in it then Renting it out later maybe.**",

        "text": "TLDR; I’ve been working on my social skills by challenging myself to stop and talk to everyone in the office and getting too know people more and have started to form new friendships. Just wanted to share the progress I’ve made and encourage others to start with a simple hello.\n\nI’m going to start this by saying I’ve always been more introverted and a very awkward person and graduating during the pandemic(2021) definitely made me miss many big high school social events like prom so I felt like my social skills had stunted.\n\nFast forward to now I work in an office but we are piloting a mostly wfh schedule and we are only in office one day a week. I’ve been there for about 8 months but have been struggling to talk to the older people there (I’m the youngest there and the closest person in age to me is a few years older) and mainly stuck to only talking to the people in my cubicle. So to challenge myself I have been going around the office on my breaks and greeting everyone and now that has moved to asking how their week has been and what has been going on in the past week. If they are busy I’ll smile and wave. Some things I try to remember is if they have a spouse and if they have kids. (I will ask after their well-being as well as a few coworkers have had to leave work to care for a sick child a few times) We are also allowed to decorate our desks so I ask about things they seem interested in that is displayed such as a fav sport and/or sports team. \n\nNow I have met everyone except 3 people in the office and am welcome to stop and chat in all of the departments. A couple people will even stop by my desk now to chat as well. These are the relationships I’ve been working on developing further. I still have a lot of room to grow but it’s a good start.\n\n If you are struggling socially and made it this far I encourage you to start small with simple smile and say hello or good morning/afternoon to an acquaintance or someone new the next time you are out and about :)",

It all changed during the school holidays when I was diagnosed with a heart condition that meant I couldnt leave the house that much when they stopped inviting me to stuff, made group chats without me and whatnot, and ever since, I feel like I've been on the outskirts. It's really killed my self confidence, making me even more nervous, to the point where I have panic attacks fairly regularly.  \n\n\nI always seem to start all the conversations with people, they pretty much always feel disengaged or bored around me, and I'm only ever invited to do stuff with them the day of, and it makes me feel so worthless and unwanted.

You don’t need to share anything about yourself. In fact, it’s preferable that you don’t since they don’t really have much interest. Even when they bare their soul and deep seated trauma, it’s best to share only surface level frou-frou bullshit like your hobbies or fav shows. \n\nStick to the script during bullshit small talk.

It's just that I have some more things in common with my dad than I do with my mom which is that we're both male and we both have similar interests around science &amp; technology.

I feel bad when this happens, but at the same time very frustrated. I’m on the autism spectrum. I can respond logically under pressure, but I’m incorrigibly emotionally intense. From my point of view, it’s all I can do to civilly answer someone’s question when I’m just not in the mood to be social at all. And when all I’ve got to give is not enough for the other person, I give up.\n\nIs there a better way to warn people that I’d really like to be left alone, and am really going out of my way to oblige a reasonable answer to a reasonable question? Because from others’ point of view, not hearing or understanding someone clearly and asking thrm to repeat themselves or clarify is a perfectly reasonable thing, and I’d rather not bite their head off over it.",

I wanted to share this experience because interacting with new people, heck even posting this, gives me anxiety and I hope this helps someone.",

        "text": "I’ve reached a place in my life where almost all of the hangouts I have are just me going out to eat with people, and I have been struggling with it. I do understand that the tradition of bonding over eating shared food together is a practice that is as old as time, but I feel like I’m tired of it.\n\nLike, I used to eat together with my family and I get that there was a certain bonding that was happening, but over the years it kind of faded away as I distanced myself. I started closing myself off and eating by myself more, and I think I prefer it that way. I think that when I go out to eat with others, it is pretty similar in that regard. I feel like there’s not much talking, so it’s kinda weird since it’s meant to be a social activity. Like for one thing, since you are eating, talking is already limited by default. But also, since we usually go eat at a public place, there are some things that I don’t feel comfortable talking about, so I’m just quiet and awkwardly eating. \n\n\nI guess I just wish there were more viable options for hanging out with people. Like I would be fine if we just sat somewhere and talked, or if we did some other activity, although I do understand the limitations. It’s very convenient to just grab a bite while connecting with others, since everyone needs to eat. It’s also not very easy to get a private space to hang out at or have everyone agree on a shared activity to do.",

There are a lot of guys in my environment, but everytime a friendship starts it quickly falls apart, since I'm constantly tense and awkward. I'm not inclined to reach out, since the interactions are unpleasant for me and guys stop talking to me probably because I always seem uninterested and tense.\n\nWith girls it is much easier, as I'm usually not bothered by a fight or flight response.\n\nI wasn't always like this. I could talk and play with boys in elementary just fine. I developed this fear in middle to high school when I stopped talking to them.\n\nDid someone had a similar problem and maybe could share some advice?

She watches who comes through the door so she can try tell people what to do or check who's in, watches what everyone else is doing so she and her mouth breather friend can criticise them in the back, yet the creepy aspect is I always find her staring at me (I blocked her when she kept trying to get assignment answers off me) I will essentially be sitting in class and I can feel someone staring at me; it is always her. I can change locations and she will still stare at me. Sometimes I ask her if she wants something then she'll roll her eyes while looking away then get back to staring 10 minutes later. Other times during something like debriefing and she's sitting at the front and I'm in the back, she will turn around and stare at me the whole.\n\nI can visibly see her in the corner or my eye or directly in front of me staring at me, while our coordinator is talking. It isn't little glances but unbashful staring for several minutes straight. It's really weird and idk what it's meant to be.\n\nI feeling like telling her constant staring is a sign of sexual attraction or getting to class early so I can take her creep corner spot.",

She’s not full time but close like me however different work loads affect different people so I can’t fault her on that.\n\nI asked her many times to get together. And of course it’s me always initiating. She used the reason that I’m far (our school is not near her home) as a reason. Again I don’t hold that against her I’ve offered to drive down since I live in her area as well. But she never followed up. \n\nFurthermore, I see her partying or hanging out with SOMEONE almost all the time etc and she only initiates if there’s more or less something to complain about or ask advice about. I can admit we both complained but more or less I stopped bc I didn’t want this friendship to be based on something like complaining so I would only reach out to ask if she’s free or congratulatory reasons etc\n\nI agonized over bringing this up to her bc there really isn’t a good time? Also people recommended I ghost her. I didn’t want to do that since I feel like that would also just be causing a lot more problems rather than discussing it.\n\nI made clear that I wasn’t blaming her but if she isn’t interested in being friends or from her behavior it seems she’s uninterested it’s fine but I’m going to walk away. She got pretty upset saying I’m taking it personally etc which honestly I considered too bc that’s a valid concern and she mentioned how she felt bombarded by my concern out of nowhere I also told her that’s valid.\n\nShe went so far to say it was not good of me to share this despite her sharing intimate details of her health with me in the past (I think this was her way of invalidating my concerns but yeah it’s fine) I told her that was unnecessary since I’m just being open and honest without blame as she is about refuting my concerns.\n\nAnyhow,’I don’t care to be her friend because again I felt there’s this unequal dynamic overall. It was an instinctual feeling that something wasn’t right which is corny but yeah.\n\nHowever I come back to it wondering should I have just let it go? Like where do you draw the line of simply being “busy” or it being one sided?? Cause a lot of my other friends are the same. Many times plans go unfollowed up but I’ve never felt like they were fake friends compared to this person.\n\nIn the end I told her I definitely don’t blame her in any way shape or form honeslty the only thing I would be mad about is her attempt to invalidate me but if someone doesn’t want to be friends I’m not gonna blame them however I’d rather not have this take take take dynamic",

Your eyesight may get slightly blurry and you won't be able to see people's facial expressions as clearly.\n\nThis has been especially useful for me because I frequently feel overwhelmed by other people's body language and facial expressions, but with the slightly blurry vision, I feel like I'm in my own little bubble and can focus on the conversation without getting too caught up in my own head.\n\nI know this trick may not work for everyone, but I wanted to share it in case it might help someone else struggling with social anxiety.\n\nHave any of you tried similar tricks to help with social anxiety?

Can't really put my finger on it, but i was... you know, an outcast. As a result i got bullied a lot, and the consequences started to outline in high school, and later in college. Though i finally got into really supportive comnunities, social anxiety and panic attacks made it impossible to fit in. It got especially worse in crowded places like parties and social events so i started to avoid them. \n2 years ago, i was at my worst thanks to a really toxic friend who acted like she understood me, and forced me into situations I wasn't comfortable with. It made my anxiety worse, and since than it is harder to live with than ever. \n\nIn september I started Masters at another, smaller uni. Maybe not so respected professionally, but from the start it had a really calming and inviting atmosphere. It started with small things: people smile at me, make small but kind gestures, and don't force me into situations that trigger me. And they actually just let me be, with all my fears and insecurities. They push me out of my comfort zone but with support and care. And another thing: they are so happy when i make small steps, which is not a big deal, but for me it is. \n\nYesterday we had an annual social event, and i was invited as a performer to the opening ceremony. First i didn't want to stay after the performance, but something switched on a few hours before and i decided: f*ck you anxiety, i will stay. \nI didn't even have a fancy dress so with a friend we went to a thrift store to quickly get one. I got dressed, went there, bought the ticket, and... stayed. \n\nI didn't push myself to dance and party, or drink alcohol, and didn't stay for too long (from 6:30 pm to 9 pm), but it was a huge step for me, and a really good time. I had fun, and could actually have a great chat with some other introverted people who were as anxious as i was! Turned out others had the same problems!\n\nI thought i would share this story with you. It is possible to make these small steps, with the right people around. A supportive envitoment makes that much difference.",

        "text": "I am cripplingly socially inept. My signs of autism were apparent as a young kid - flapping my hands, rocking, no eye contact, no verbal filter, could not stand touching, etc. and have only spiraled as I've hit teenage years, soon adulthood. I don't like labeling myself with \"because of autism,\" but I know it contributes to most of my issues.\n\nTo preface, I function normally online and in my own head. I can speak eloquently and maintain a conversation online, I don't have to think about it too hard. The only exception of real life is that I know I can present well, but that doesn't necessarily require a two-way discussion.\n\n But I'm not \"empty.\" I don't feel loneliness or boredom from isolation, and down to my core, I don't think I truly like people. But I need to function. I know that I need to be able to operate socially and normally and that's just what it is. I don't.\n\nWhen it comes to talking to another human being, face to face, I physically cannot do it. I can't hold a conversation if it's not a heavy word-vomit exchange of information. It's excruciating. I can't understand what the fuck is going on. I can see the facial expressions change to judgement, or offense, but I don't know why. I don't even know how to start or continue a conversation. I keep being told I sound like I'm being abused. My voice is too soft, cracks, and nobody can make out what I'm saying. That I don't sound confident or like I don't have any self respect. That I sound like I'm in pain. I speak no more than a few words per day. So I try to correct this --- then, I'm far too loud, obnoxious, angry, threatening, scary, rude. I can't modulate my voice correctly. I can't convey how I'm actually feeling. So every conversation I can actually hold, and I mean damn-near every single one, I do something wildly offensive and I never find out what it is I did wrong or how I got there.\n\nSo I guess what I'm asking is what I can do. I'm not trying to necessarily speak like a car-dealer with a bag of cocaine up his ass. I'm just looking to function, and blend in when I need to. But any advice or recommendation is greatly appreciated, so thank you for reading all of this.",
