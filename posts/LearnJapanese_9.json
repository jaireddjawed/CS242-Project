Im still fairly new at learning Japanese, and both these schools offer to teach starting at my low level. Im planning on studying on my own for the next 6 months before I move. I also understand that these are two different focuses, so Id like to focus my question on those who are currently working in Japan for this post.  \n\n\nNamely, what would you say is more helpful, being able to understand small day to day interactions or being able to support yourself economically with a job? Im going to be taking classes while living off of savings most likely, so being able to get a job asap is something I would want, but id also like to read Manga and watch Anime and be able to read the filling in my kombini onigiri as well. So for someone who is looking to move full time to Japan, which is the better option?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, I'd love to hear opinions of those who have gone to either of these schools. Id like to find my own apartment and live on my own (im in my late 20s) but that also sounds like a lot of work and might cost me a bit as well.",

        "text": "So I did not expect this at all... I suddenly need to be conversational in about a month. I can read pretty much anything I want (my vocab is 13k+ right now), but I struggle to do any output and now I need to be able to at least hold a conversation with natives. I am so screwed. My listening skill is non-existent to start with because I was content to just read. I've not made a topic before, but at this point I am dropping my Anki SRS new cards and going to be focusing on getting to be at least able to communicate. For lack of another speaker - I am the go-between because I \"know\" Japanese. I am not prepared... it is a unique opportunity that I should not pass up though no one else can fill the role either. So I have a vested interest in coming across well.\n\nI've never outputted before - stringing together even basic sentences without ruining the grammar racks my brain. I at least know the subject I have to discuss with natives. So the vocab is not a problem, the subject matter I am familiar with - to a point. \n\nI am up the creek without a paddle on this one. Because I am completely lopsided on learning I will even do shadowing if possible. Is there anything like an old ipod system that I can use to dump audio to a system where I can auto-cycle through chunks with an old-school headphone jack? This sounds odd - but I need whatever it is to not have any camera or audio recording capabilities of its own. Bluetooth devices are not allowed, but I can one-ear if its tethered. At work I cannot use Japanese IME, but I can write on scrap paper for production. Since there is no point ever trying to write at the speed of speech, I am not sure how to use my idle time productively. All suggestions appreciated because as I mentioned - I'm pretty much toast otherwise.\n\nGoals:\n\nBe able to at least understand spoken Japanese at a slow pace. (Bare minimum)\n\nBe able to hold a thirty-minute conversation at N2 level - mostly just listening with some premade questions on my part. Being able to understand the responses and translating follow-up questions is about the minimum, being able to respond on the spot is ideal. (What is expected.)\n\nSide note: What person pronoun should I use if I am going to be talking to a bunch of younger people? I am not the senpai, but its \"casual\" business atmosphere. They are likely in their 20s, but I guess someone in their 50s might be the rep too... Thanks in advance.",

It seems like it's very possible that if you have an intimate relationship with someone that are you devoted to or who has higher rank than you, but that you know very well, you might opt for plain humble instead of polite humble.\n\nIf this is true, it is interesting if this applies to the sonkeigo (honorific) forms though, because when talking about the actions of other people you may always want to use polite speech. But if it is of yourself and your own actions and you're speaking humbly to someone you're very close with (i.e., a butler to a child who he raised, an assistant to a boss who they have known for 5 years), you might want to use humble familiar.",

        "text": "Hi all,\n\nI shared this survey several weeks ago but it got removed since I didn't ask for approval from the mods in advance (totally my fault). I got approval this time around and I'm hoping to get at least 100 respondents (currently around 80) before I close the survey later this week. Details on the survey are listed below. \n\nI’m a language teacher-researcher at Himeji Dokkyo University in Japan and I’m doing research on the use of ChatGPT to learn a foreign language. Understandably, the use of ChatGPT for foreign language learning is a controversial topic, and I'd like to hear learners' opinions on the issue.\n\nOne of the main reasons why I'm requesting participants from Reddit is due to the fact that self-directed/informal language learners often get overlooked in foreign language research compared to those learning a target language (TL) at a formal school or institution. I know that this doesn't reflect all the learners in this sub, but I suspect many of you are studying a TL independently without the guidance of a formal language instructor. To be clear, both independent language learners and those who are taking formal language classes are eligible to participate. The only requirements are that participants must be at least 18 years of age and must have experience using ChatGPT to learn a foreign language. Experience using ChatGPT in this context is fairly broad. I'd be happy to hear your responses even if you've only used it a few times to evaluate its potential as a language learning resource.\n\nPlease click on the link below if you are interested in completing the survey. Based on previous responses, it should only take about 5 minutes to complete. Data will be collected anonymously and I will share the results with this sub when they are ready. Thanks for your time and help!!\n\n[https://iu.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\\_a3LmZMMD5aGEo86](https://iu.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_a3LmZMMD5aGEo86)\n\nNote: This post has been approved by the mods.",

I'm not even counting the time I spend on input like reading graded readers and watching anime/dramas. Also, Kanji is easy for me since I can read and speak Chinese. \n\nI've read through Tae Kim, finished Japanese the Manga Way, currently re-reading Genki I and doing the exercises methodically. At the same time I attend a physical japanese class for 2 hours a week. I'm much farther ahead than the class now, since they haven't gone into any verb conjugation, Te-form, plain form, etc. \n\nThe one thing that it provides is an opportunity to practice output. Also, I guess compared to just reading on my own, they spend a lot of time on a single topic to really cement it into memory. Like 4 hours on how to use より, or  どちら . On my own I would have probably read that chapter in 20 minutes and moved on. \n\nMy aim is not to take the JLPT but rather to understand Japanese media and communicate with locals  when I visit Japan. Do you guys think I should continue with the classes?",

        "text": "First of all, thanks all of you for that good welcome for the Anime Sentence list! I know that list it's not useful for everyone, I already knew this. But I also think most of you thought that it was nothing more than a simple list… but that's wrong. This list was the first step for something bigger (Hint: at first I was planning to do an Anki deck).\n\n**And this is where I need your help, guys!** I want to hear the opinion both advanced and newbies, all of you are meaningful for this and can give a different POV. I'll do my best to explain what this project is about so all of you can give your opinion.\n\n**Purpose**\n\nA lot of people prefer a reading approach while others are visual learners (like me), and there's no incorrect way. It's just that everyone learns differently. So… I though… Why not do both? This is where the Anime Sentence list enters.\n\nThe idea should include:\n\n1. The same approach as \"Learn to read in Japanese\" from Roger Lake or \"Kanji Learner's Course Graded Reading Sets\" from Conning, use a sentence and then offer the translation. This could be literal or not… I'm not sure which could be best (For me, I like the literal so I can really know how that language works).\n2. Anki SRS style, pretty similar to what Roger Lake did with his Japanese Audio Flashcards or what Pimsleur / Assimil does… Repeat time after time so you'll never forget it.\n3. Story-driven approach in a really meaningful and enjoyable storytelling.\n4. For intermediate-advanced learners, usage of the interlinear method.\n5. **It MUST be engaging like video games do!**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Games are **pleasurable learning engines that deliver an experience that's deeply, intrinsically motivating**. Over time you absorb the rules, build your skills, tackle ever-greater challenges — and in the process, you're transformed in some way that's meaningful to YOU.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Amy Jo Kim ([Medium](https://amyjokim.medium.com/what-makes-games-so-engaging-2a06ca3eadf1))\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The \"engage like a game\" project**\n\nA interactive story-driven, chapter by chapter, which were divided by difficulty (the same way a game works). In this story, you'll learn words with the SRS-approach like Assimil or Pimsleur does. After each story, you'll get tested with questions or, if you prefer, a cloze test. This cloze test could be reading or listening (the same way SuperNative does).\n\n**Giving feedback**\n\n1. Do you think it would be useless? Please, let me know why. What would you change to make it useful to you?\n2. On the opposite, it would be useful? I also want to know why. What makes you feel like \"this is going to be useful for me\"?\n3. Do you prefer a direct translation or do you want to read a literal one?\n4. Do you think a question-answer test is a good idea? Maybe Cloze is better? Or… There's a way that could be more enjoyable for you?\n5. And last… **Would you use it?** Well, remember that this was done using Anime and you'll see and listen the anime vids.\n\nMaybe my idea is wrong and I need to start again from zero or maybe… I took the wrong way.

        "text": "Hi. So after reading a lot of things from my last post about using anime for Japanese, I had a couple of questions. So I've done a bit of research into things like doing Refold, Matt vs Japan, Aussieman, and other sources.\n\nI had a couple of questions that I wanted to ask. \n\n1. Should I be immersing from day 1, provided that I also do things like read textbooks (I'm choosing tae kim) and doing vocab/kanji alongside it? (I have a good vocab and kanji deck in anki ready to go).\n2. So obviously, comprehensible input is how people learn languages, and immersion is just a way of getting comprehensible input, but does that mean I should be using comprehensible input all the time? I watched a video from Matt vs Japan on whether or not input has to be comprehensible, but I wanted other people's advice. Here is the video btw: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeOmc1nRGG4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeOmc1nRGG4)\n3. I'm confused on what I should actually be looking out for during immersion. My idea is that with comprehensible input, I should just aim to understand as much as possible, but also be on the look out for i+1 sentences as this is how people progress. \n\nWith that, I also have a routine developed that I wanted to ask if this is okay.\n\nI'm still a major beginner and haven't really touched grammar books all that much yet, but I have been grinding anki for vocab (about 500 words in now). I tried sitting through a VN session because I had a bunch of VNs downloaded and tried them out and I found that a lot of the ones that I had (being romance VNs) were pretty easy to digest and I could catch onto what they were saying if I looked up every unknown word or grammar structure in that sentence. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy routine:\n\n1. I guess read through tae kim and do anki (20 words)\n2. Reading my VN for however long I can. The VN is an easy romance one that I think I can digest since I've read it before in English.\n\nHow I read: \n\nOpen up my VN, yomichan, texthooker, etc. \n\nRead sentence by sentence. I then look up everything unknown to me. \n\nIf I understand it, I move on. \n\nIf I don't understand it even after a minute of trying to decipher it, I move on.\n\n3. Watch anime with Japanese subtitles and do as few look-ups as possible, only looking out for what I can understand. I also want to combine this with comprehensible input videos on YouTube. If any of you people have any good channel recommendations, that would be lovely, thanks. \n\nThat's pretty much my routine and all the questions I had. Thanks for reading.",

Life and such has gotten in the way, causing me to take long breaks and lose progress, but I'm planning to take JLPT N4 at the end of the year and am hopeful about passing. \n\nIn addition to Japanese-only 1:1 lessons with my instructor twice a week, I focus on listening practice on YouTube and WaniKani in my free time. I also use Quizlet for vocab but have been open to exploring other options. \n\nThat of course brought me to Anki, which I looked at ages ago but was too lazy at the time to really put in the work to understand its benefits. Now that I've done more research, I'm still really skeptical that this will work for my learning style. \n\nI rely solely on the \"write\" function in Quizlet, as I've always been what I will just call a \"writing\" learner. Throughout high school, college, grad school, etc., I would take lots of notes and re-write the content when studying ahead of exams. Writing out flashcards was more helpful than actually memorizing them. I seem to retain information really well this way. \n\nWhen it comes to Anki, using pure flashcards isn't very appealing to me, so I've been searching and searching for ways to edit existing decks (for instance, starting with the JLPT Tango N5 MIA Omega Deck) to allow me to type out the answer. But this doesn't seem to be an easy task? \n\nI've watched several YouTube videos/read Reddit threads and those suggestions either require messing with the templates (to which I've had no success) or don't fit my needs exactly (i.e. they are talking about creating a brand new deck). \n\nAm I missing something?

        "text": "Hey everyone\\~\n\n**So… I came back. I FINALLY FINISHED.**\n\nThis took tooooooo much time and a lot of work. It's not just to copy-paste a sentence, this was a one-by-one review to be sure that the selected sentence was the right meaning (cuz you know, words can have a lot of them). Also, I took around 6 months off of this, sorry.\n\nFor the ones that forgot what the title was about… Take a look at the [Anime freq list](https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/m8ti5d/2k_most_common_anime_words_anime_frequency_list_8/) (2k common words) that I already shared on here!\n\n**TL;DR:** [This is the url](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11HfrnLl5445itXiF2IZ4Nq-ThHm809ZUKmM_h1nesKA/edit?usp=sharing) for the people who don't want to read the post.\n\n**Words that have been removed**\n\nThere's a lot of words that were taken out, this could be due to…\n\n1. I coudn't find an example with THAT exact usage (like combined verbs as 掛ける)\n2. A lot of verbs happened to be \"to be able to…\" which also could be the potential form of the verb which made the work even harder. That's why I left out a few of them…\n3. There's some words that are almost never used alone (because they're always in a combined word with other kanji)\n\nBut this is not only sad… I've also added new words too!\n\n**What you'll find**\n\n1. **Order:** This was supposed to be the order for the story but… Yeah this took a lot of time so don't blame me plz 😭\n2. **Reuse:** You'll find the sentenced reused if this has any word added. This was for two reasons: faster work + you'll review the same a few times so, more possibilities to be reminded.\n3. **Word:** The word that you're going to learn.\n4. **Sentence:** Sentence used, word in bold.\n5. **Anime:** Which anime was taken from\n6. **Timing:** Correct timing for the sentence. This was a HARD work because a lot of them didn't had the same timing I had on my subs… Checking and checking, there was no choice.\n7. **Chapter:** Anime chapter + url source. This could be Zoro or some Spanish anime websites.\n8. **Meaning (EN + ES):** You'll find the meaning in Spanish and English. When I started, I tried to be the most precise as possible but after time… I switched and started to do them more literal so. Be aware.\n9. **Story (EN + ES):** If anyone reminds… This was pretended to be a story-driven in which your decisions will affect the course. Now that I've finished, I can start thinking on a good way to get on this…\n10. **Sentence dissection (EN + ES)**: Aww, I thought some people would find it useful. I'm a literal learner so I can really get a grasp about how the natives think. So… I've added this but, as you can see, I didn't finished. Yep, this list was too much time consuming.\n11. **Notes:** Some of them have a grammar, explanation or something attached here.\n\n**Other things you'll find**\n\nI've also added a Grammar tab where I've added explanations for the grammar points that were on the Anime list. Also, I've added a few that I've found interesting. You'll find the explanation and a few examples.\n\n**How to use it**\n\nWell, there's no easy way to get the audio from all of the anime's on this list. I've did this by hand, one by one, so… But I'm pretty sure there's addons to make Anki cards with just one click.\n\n**Some notes**\n\nI did all of this ALONE. So… Mistakes are possible. And also, maybe some of you found examples for words I left out. I revised using local subs and sorry but there's no way I would download all of the subs available in the world.\n\n**What to expect on a future**\n\nI've been thinking on \"what's the best way to approach this\" for months. For real. I'm no joking, I did my best using my free time after work to make this… Even my boyfriend told me that I'm glued to the sofa haha\n\nAt first I thought on using Twine (a story-driven interactive just with text) cuz I'm too busy to program a game. Some kind of mix that could make everyone happy (even myself)… Did you heard of Supernative? Well, that's another idea.\n\nAs I've said… I'm sure there'll be errors. Feel free to report them. Also, if you have any interesting and cool idea about how to make this a \"really interesting interactive story that could be interesting for anyone\"… I'm all ears!",
