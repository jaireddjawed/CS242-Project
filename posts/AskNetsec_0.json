One of my first tasks was to implement threat Intel feeds into our SIEM, however, I was told I was not allowed to do this since these feeds aren’t on a “fedramp high ato system” so now I’m confused as I’ve never had issues implementing a threat Intel platform or feed with any other compliance standard. \n\nWhat gives? Anyone else experience this in a FedRAMP environment?",

Few challenges around this type of solution.  This is a reactive solution that isn't easy to PoC, hard to know what  you get before you buy and experience it.\n\nEnd  goal would be to send logs from all of our important systems to the  vendor's SIEM. They monitor, alert, and do basic response as permissions  allow. We already have an EDR and don't want to use the EDR managed  product because it will only cover the endpoints and won't include other  logs we want to import into the SIEM.\n\nWe  would like access to the SIEM and be able to run reports and search for  things as needed but don't want to be setting up reports, tweaking  things, etc that all should be handled by the vendor.\n\nLooked at Rapid7, Arctic Wolf, DarkTrace, Blackpoint, , Exabeam, NetSurion among others.",

In your opinion, what are the benefits of using Microsoft Defender for Endpoint over other endpoint protection solutions?\n3. What are the potential drawbacks or limitations of using Microsoft Defender for Endpoint?\n4. How effective do you think Microsoft Defender for Endpoint is at detecting and mitigating threats?\n5. How does Microsoft Defender for Endpoint compare to other endpoint protection solutions in terms of ease of use and manageability?\n\nAlso, I'm not very well familiar with Microsoft licenses and products, but I'm not sure I understand what is Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.\n\nIt is an additional sensor/add-on that upgrade default Microsoft Defender Antivirus or is it a separate, self-contained product?\n\nWe have around 6000 endpoints (Windows 30%, Linux 69% and MacOS 1%). \n\nHow much would it cost and are there any discounts? Who has dealt with this?",

The documentation is geared toward educating folks and for public consumption. In this case, I'm using my labs, which, if compromised, can be powered off and reimaged. It will be a bummer since it does take time to set up.\n\nLooking at the screenshots, I noticed I'm volunteering information, like hostnames, IP addresses, and whatnot.  What isn't revealed are any secrets, like passwords or secrets; even if they are shown, they are being refreshed regularly. However, not disclosing it complicates documentation and automation.\n\nI'm curious about what kind of risks there are and how to mitigate them best.  I do have a site-to-site VPN to the lab, which allows me to access devices, and I should check whether a compromised host in the lab can access my home network.  The lab is internet accessible. \n\nOne example is creating \"golden images\" for applications using Packer. In this case, build nodes are running in a (mostly) isolated network, so the documentation includes the steps to configure firewalls and switches to support that network and hypervisor configuration to support ephemeral nodes.  Most folks would only document Packer and briefly discuss networking and hypervisor configuration, which I found needed improvement.",

The instructor stated that using Azure an attacker can make a subdomain under Microsoft.com\n\nI'm not talking about running a malware domain on azure or anything like that. The instructor was specifically saying that an adversary could run a malware domain and make it appear as baddomain[.]microsoft.con. \n\nWhen pushed for further details the instructor just said \"Well I haven't actually tried it but based off what I've read about what they're [Microsoft] doing with the ASN [Microsoft's default ASN] and Azure it should be possible.\"\n\nNow here's the thing, I'm not new to this field. I've been working in SOCs, doing incident response, threat hunting, and threat intelligence for 10 years. This bold statement struck me as simply off.\n\nIf someone had managed to figure out a way to use Azure to register a subdomain under Microsoft.com then I'm sure it'd be in reporting somewhere. Everyone and their mother would be chomping at the bit to figure out how they can use this to create fake domains that sound like they're from Microsoft. As such I haven't been able to actually find any reports (or even blog posts) talking about anyone actually doing is.\n\n\nSo my question is does anyone have either as technical explanation on how this is possible or any reporting saying that someone has done this (even as simply a proof of concept)?\n\nI'm happy to be wrong if someone's got specific verifiable proof that's not \"Well based on what I read.\" Without providing what you actually read.\n\nAnd before someone mentions DNS poisoning, I had thought about that.i asked the instructor if they meant compromising the Authoritative DNS server or poisoning a caching server or host file. The instructor reiterated that no, they're specifically talking using Azure to get a sub domain under microsoft.com",

This week, my main and only customer told me that they will no longer be requiring my services -- the (in)famous pink slip (or email, in this case).\n\nWon't get into too much detail in order to not breach the NDA, but it's one of the largest financial institutions in Europe. I was handling several DC's for them, and they decide they no longer need those DC/branch offices. They will be moving all their apps to the cloud, and all their personnel back to their HQ. They'll only have a skeleton crew at the locations which I manage, so that makes my role rather redundant.\n\nThe reason I opened this thread is not to complain ( I'm single, no obligations, no rent, and I have several certs, including CCNP Enterprise and JNCIS-SP), but I'm curious what is the status of remote work where you're currently at ?\n\nThis contract was 100% remote. Since I got the news this week, I think applied to some 200 jobs already, and while I found some very interesting ones which were a good fit, and which paid even better than my current contract. However all of them required either hybrid or on-site presence.\n\nSince the pandemic ended, what was the policy in your company in regards to remote/office hours ? And what do you think will be the future of remote work, especially for us ICT folks ?\n\nAlso, if you happen to know anyone looking for a 100% remote based network engineer, don't hesitate to reach out to me in private.",

After a few months, they just said “We’re not using this anymore, everyone just use Google drive.” without even giving me a heads up about that decision.
