        "text": "It can be argued that a telescope and a microscope are the same tool with opposite targets. One focusing on the small and the other large. They both work on magnification. General relativity addresses large objects and the fabric of spacetime. Spacetime gets distorted and even produces waves that travel across the universe. Quantum Mechanics addresses the very small and makes predictions using the wave function. Please note, there are waves in both areas of study which is where they are similar. As with sound, radio and light: they are waves and as such, are subject to interference, both destructive and constructive. Recently LIGO observatory has detected gravitational waves which warp space and time. Destructive waves are used in noise canceling headphones. With all of these wave types permeating the universe, there is bound to be such interference. These can potentially produce anomalies. When measuring the universe via massive telescopes we do see anomalies. They have been coined dark matter and dark energy. What if these anomalies are caused by interference? Space does seem empty, yet it is full of waves. Waves of light, gravitational waves, radio waves, microwaves and subatomic waves. There are many ways to learn physics. Some are visual, such as tree felling or use of Popsicle sticks and some are mathematical. I personally am a visual learner. In physics, the term entropy is used. It has been argued successfully that entropy, disorder or heat change will reach equilibrium eventually. AQUAL hypothesis has some ground. What I am proposing is dark matter is not real, nor is dark energy. People much smarter then I am are also challenging this assumption. I am an ignorant person, relatively speaking. But I am proposing, the very beginning of an idea, to take in consideration wave interference to address the discrepancies observed. I don't know the true shape of our universe. I am ignorant of so many things. I am asking for help.",
