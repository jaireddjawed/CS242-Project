In the evening, I tried to make another cup but the pressure was significantly lower and the machine was due it's maintenance so I ran a cleaning cycle, descaled the machine and changed the water filter. After doing this, despite the grind being at the finest possible level and fresh beans being used, I cannot get the pressure past the pre-infusion point. When I put the pressurised basket and run a shot of water, the pressure goes up.\n\nAny ideas what the problem may be and how to fix it?",

I never did finish so I'm not sure how long it would have really taken. I did a deep clean of my grinder and that seemed to help but I'm still no where close to the times in the article, or the times other people seem to be reaching when looking around online.\n\nIs there anything I can do? Does anyone have any idea why my grind time is so long?\n\nMore importantly can someone explain to me why I even care at all since it was working at the grind size I actually use just fine, but now that I know it has an issue at finer grind times I can't stop obsessing over why that may be. \n\nThanks!",

I want to keep the coffee really concentrated so that it doesn't dilute my milk, especially since i use soymilk which is already thinner than dairy milk.\n\nIs this ratio always based on measurement by weight or are some ratios based on volume as well?\n\nDoes the standard coffee-to-water ratio consider the amount of water that will be leftover in the bottom chamber? For example, if i use 1 gram coffee to 100 gms of water, how much of the water will remain at the bottom in a 6-cup pot?\n\nMany of the answers here about adjusting the serving size say that it's best to fill the pot and basket fully (i.e. not adjust the amount). I have a 6-cup moka pot. I don't want to buy multiple pots. Should i return this one and get a smaller one and when i have more people, just use the smaller one twice?\n\nIf i want to make concentrated coffee shots for milk coffee, as well as be able to adjust the serving size from one person to 6 people, should i ditch the moka pot altogether and go for a French press instead for more flexibility?\n\nSince other people here have suggested adjusting the coffee and water amounts to get a smaller serving size in a bigger moka pot. If i do go with that, will the coffee-water ratio change based on the minimum amount of water required to create pressure and the amount of water that needs to be leftover to avoid burning? Will using preheated water till the top but less amount of coffee help?",

Our company is looking to add coffee service as an offering to our clients and I am working out all the details and associated costs. I've been looking at brewers that drip into airpots and I'm curious if anyone has any input for what type is best for that kind of service.\n\nOur events are usually 150-250 people, oftentimes weddings. I've been reading a lot about the amount of products needed, I've got it all diagramed out and all hypothetic margins calculated. The one thing that I'm kind of stuck on (due to my unfamiliarity with them) is the brewers. We have some 2.2L airpots and I would imagine that we'd need to brew 50 cups per hour over 2-3 hours. I saw some that were \\~$250 from Bunn (their base model I believe) as well as, ya know, $4,000 ones that obviously I'm not interested in.\n\nSo my question is, what's the best kind of brewer to use in regards to cost effectiveness and longevity/ease of use? Should I just get a normal, large coffee pot and fill the airpots, or should I get a brewer that dispenses directly into the airpots? Looking for ease of use for my staff (they're grumpy bartenders), mobility (I don't want to tap into any water lines), ease of cleaning, etc. Is there anyone here that could maybe point me in the right direction? I'd appreciate any help as I've already scoured the internet and I heard you guys really like coffee around here. Please help me haha.\n\nThanks so much for reading and any helpful replies!",

Upon visiting their website, I was greeted with promotional pop-up windows and a deal for new customers that included a free gift. Intrigued, I ordered four bottles of the original flavor, which was their best deal, but still ended up spending over $50. When the order arrived, I opened one of the bottles and tried it, only to find that it had a chemically burnt aftertaste that was very unpleasant. My husband agreed and we tried it a few more times, but the flavor just wasn't up to par with Jot Coffee. Disappointed, I contacted Javy Coffee to return the order. This is their return policy:\n\n\"We offer a 30 Day Refund Guarantee from the date of your purchase on your first order.  Our policy lasts 30 days. If 30 days have gone by since your order has been delivered, we would not be able offer you a refund or exchange.  To further clarify this:  ‍If you've ordered 4 bottles and are not satisfied with the product. We would expect you to return 3 bottles in exchange for a refund for all 4 bottles. If you've used opened 2 out of those 4 bottles and are returning just 2 bottles, that would void the satisfaction guarantee.\"\n\nSince we only opened 1 bottle out of the 4, I asked them for a refund. However, they responded by directing me to their refund policy on sale items, which stated \"We do not offer refunds or replacements on sale items.\"\n\nI explained that I had only opened 1 bottle out of the 4 I had ordered, and that I believed the items were not sale items, but rather that promotional codes had been applied to the order. I disputed their response, pointing out that their policy did not specifically mention promotional codes.\n\nMy advice to others who want to try Javy Coffee for the first time is, DO NOT use any promotional codes or accept any free items they offer, as they do not accept returns in such cases. Despite calling and emailing multiple times, I received the same response.",
