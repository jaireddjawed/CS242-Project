One school that I handle is located in the middle of a bunch of farmland a few hours from where I live.\n\nAn account showed up on my route today with the borrower's name as Sugar Snaps. I scroll through the account thinking there's no way this can be real. Someone named their child Sugar Snaps. Sugar Snaps. No fucking way.\n\nI give the home phone number a call, and a woman picks up. The thing about debt collections is to basically assume whoever picks up is the borrower and assume that they have the money to pay the balance in full, even if they owe 50k. This helps cut back on them trying to worm out of the call by saying you have the wrong number. The woman answers, and I just go straight with, \"Hello, Sugar? How are you today?\"\n\n\"Uh... what?\" Okay, so probably a wrong number.\n\n\"I'm sorry, I'm trying to reach Sugar Snaps.\"\n\nThe woman on the other end *exploded*. Turns out, I was right about there not being a person named Sugar Snaps.\n\nThe school that contracted the debt has a veterinary school that will help out the local farms by providing vet services at a lower rate.\n\nSugar Snaps is a horse. A fucking horse.\n\nI'm trying to not let it show I'm dying on my end of this call while the woman is screaming at me that she's not paying. Turns out the vet students couldn't save Sugar Snaps, and the woman is going off about how they killed her horse.\n\nI guess it's fine that she doesn't pay, because the account is in a deceased horse's name, not hers, so it will be reported on Sugar Snap's credit.",

        "text": "I work for a large auto insurance company. My job is to investigate accidents, find out who is at fault, and break the news.\n\nFunny enough, this claim wasn't even mine, I just happened to take all of the statements for it (it's a call center so we have to answer each others' phones if they're away). \n\nThe accident was pretty straight forward. Our insured was making a left turn from a side road onto a boulevard and claimant was making a left turn from the boulevard onto the side road. Had everything gone smoothly, our insured would have waited until the car was out of her way before pulling from her stop sign, but she didn't and a crash happened. Liability was overwhelmingly clear. Except for one thing.\n\nI took the statement from claimant's wife first. She says she's a passenger and I ask the normal questions: when did the driver first notice the other car pull from the stop sign? Did he swerve or honk or slam on the breaks to avoid impact? The wife says the driver saw the car a second or so before impact and that he didn't swerve or honk because he didn't have to - he was well within his lane and she was the negligent one.\n\nYeah, that's not how this works. You have a duty to avoid an accident if you see one coming. To see another car on a course for impact and not do anything to avoid it? That's negligence and in this state that means you get your damages repaired on your own policy.\n\nBut to add another twist, our driver and a witness say that the wife wasnt in the car at all. Claimant had no passengers. And when we asked claimant if he had any passengers he said \"No. ... Oh wait, yeah my wife.\"\n\nSince claimant didn't put any negligence on himself, the negligence for our driver was overwhelming, and the only negligence for claimant was from someone who wasn't even there, we paid that claim in full - an outcome I'm happy with. But really? Don't lie about being in the accident if you werent. She's not even claiming injury, I'm still not entirely sure why they're insisting she was there.",

        "text": "My name is Jamesthegill. Nine years ago an invisible dome crashed down on me, cutting me off from the rest of the world. From 2006 to 2012 I worked for a UK telecommunications provider, selling telephone lines, broadband, TV (and, for a brief period, mobiles). I look back fondly on my time, partly because I was good enough not to get fired (though I came within a hair's breadth of it, escaping with an 18 month final written warning hanging over my head), partly because my colleagues were - by and large - fun to work with, and partly because we were guaranteed at least one entertaining customer per week.\n\n[Previously](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromcallcenters/search?q=jamesthegill&amp;restrict_sr=on)\n\nThe \"On This Day\" feature on Facebook has brought up a few of my exasperated comments about the customers I had to deal with, and it seems that six years ago was an \"interesting\" day for geographical knowledge. Maybe I was on the call queue for the international calling plan options, who knows. The calling plan itself cost (at the time) £5 a month and would give the customer free calls for up to an hour to 36 countries, so it was drummed into us to check which countries before selling this option.  \n\n\"We've covered your domestic calling options, are you likely to be making any calls abroad?\"  \n\"Oh, yes.\"  \n\"Ok, we have an option that might be able to give you free calls overseas. Which countries will you be calling?\"  \n\"Europe and Africa.\"  \n\nSwing and a miss. I decided that maybe my approach needed some work, so tried a different tack a few hours later.\n\n\"So do you have friends abroad that you might be calling?\"  \n\"Yes.\"  \n\"Oh really, whereabouts?\"  \n\"Bristol.\"  \n\nBristol was a city about 20 miles/32km from where this customer was based, in the same country. Finally, the most bizarre call I've *ever* had, quoted verbatim:\n\n\"Hi, you're through to James at &lt;company&gt;, how can I help?\"  \n“It’s not for me, it’s for my niece. She’s been trying to send me a letter but it’s not been getting here. Is that ok?”  \n“What, an email?”  \n“No, a normal postal letter. I’m just letting you know it’s not been getting here. Bye.”  ",

        "text": "I work for a large auto insurance company. My job is to investigate claims to find out who is at fault and break the news.\n\nI got a multiple car loss and our guy was the middle car of three. I have to find out if he rear ended the car in front and then was rear ended or if he was pushed into the car in front of him by the car behind him.\n\nI asked the guy and he says he thinks he stopped in time and then got hit, pushing his car into the car in front of him. But the final nail in the coffin was that the car in front felt 2 impacts: one from him and a second from the force of the car behind. We're negligent.\n\nI told the guy and he seemed chill. I let him know his policy and his options and we set up to get his car repaired. Since he has a Tesla, we had someone sent out to his house to do an estimate. But since he has a Tesla, they don't know how to price a Tesla. So the car gets towed to the only body shop it can go to which is in a different state and has appointments a month out. \n\nThe appointment date comes and goes but I still don't see a bill to the file so I can send it to the other responsible party to pay their portion. Maybe Teslas just take longer to repair. Maybe they need to order parts. Ok.\n\nEventually I get a voicemail from the guy asking why everything was taking so long and to call him back. That same day I get a call from the mostly responsible party asking for my liability decision. I told them the car in front felt 2 impacts so we're splitting liability and we're taking car of both car's damages so keep an eye out for the bill. \n\nThis was a sneaky (and disturbingly lazy) move on their part. It turns out they (after a freaking month) still hadn't finished their investigation and simply used my decision as their own. That's fine. It's protocol to share liability decisions. The only thing unusual that happened was that their investigation took so long.\n\nI go ahead and call the Tesla guy and ask him if he has heard from the body shop. Why are repairs taking so long?\n\n*He told the body shop to not start repair on his car.* It has been sitting there for nearly 2 months collecting storage fees. He didn't approve of my liability decision and was waiting for the other insurance company to do their own investigation. \n\nThat's not how this works. We're handling his damages. We'll bill the other guys. Their decision does not matter as we have already concluded he's negligent. The car in front felt two impacts. We have an ethical responsibility to pay the claims we owe. \"I understand how at your desk you think I'm negligent but I wanted the other insurance company to do their own investigation.\"\n\nHe blamed me for telling them my liability decision. I told him that's completely protocol. He whined about how now the other insurance company wont pay for his damages. They wouldn't have anyway! He's negligent! The entire time he was such a petulant child because he didn't get his way.\n\nNow he keeps calling in whining about how the car hasn't been repaired yet and it's been over two months. Why do you think it's been over two months. BECAUSE YOU TOLD THEM TO NOT REPAIR YOUR CAR! And those storage fees? We're not paying those.\n\nIt's month 3 now. The car is still in New York, not fixed. They're debating whether it's even repairable. I need to call the other responsible party and make sure their limits are even good for this. In the meantime, Tesla guy still calls in all dissatisfied with our service when the entire reason his car hasn't been repaired yet is because of his entitlement issues. And because that body shop is *notorious* for being impossible. Slow, charging obscene rates, and difficult to contact. If this doesn't turn into a complaint call, I'll be amazed.",

It was a pretty slow day, as summer is over so not as many people are travelling, and for a long time, there weren't any calls, so I was chatting to the guy, he was telling me about what it's like to work there, etc.\n\nFinally he gets a call through, so I listen in on the other headset, and it went like this (CCG is Call Centre Guy, AM is Angry Man. Also, apologies in advance if the formatting is weird, I haven't tried this before):\n\n&gt;CCG: Hello, you're through to ----, my name is ----, how can I help you today?\n\n&gt;AM: Yes, hello, well, it's nice to finally talk to someone, I was getting fed up of press 1 for this and press 2 for that, and listening to your bingly-bongly-music BULLSHIT\n\n&gt;CCG: Oh, I'm sorry about that sir. I'll make a note-\n\n&gt;AM: YES, well -unintelligle rambling, CCG looks confused- I want to speak to someone who knows what they're doing!\n\n&gt;CCG: Well sir, I'm happy to help you, if you could just tell me what your enquiry is-\n\n&gt;AM: YOU KNOW what my enquiry is! I just want to speak to someone who knows what they're doing!\n\n&gt;CCG: I'm sorry sir, but you haven't actually told me what it is yet. Before we can proceed I also need your name and -\n\n&gt;AM: -huffs loudly- I booked a holiday and now (another insurance provider in the same building) says that I'm not covered and can't get my money back, I want my money back!\n\n&gt;CCG: Ah, right sir, well it sounds like you need another department, you're actually through to the (this department) and we don't handle claims, so I'll need to transfer you-\n\n&gt;AM: No you bloody don't, you transfer me and I'll have to listen to your bingly BULLSHIT again, I just want YOU to fix this or find me someone who can actually do their job!\n\n&gt;CCG: Sir, I'm sorry, I am trying to help you, but I'm afraid you're through to the wrong department-\n\n&gt;AM: I don't give a shit! You can just take the reference number from (other provider) and do your job!\n\n&gt;CCG: Sir-\n\n&gt;AM: I AM A LAWYER! I AM A LAWYER! I can charge £400 an hour, unlike *you*, just some idiot in a call centre!\n\nAll through his \"I'm sorry sir\"s, CCG was looking over at me rolling his eyes. I was trying very hard not to giggle as I don't know whether AM would be able to hear me through the set I was listening through or not.\n\nSadly, I didn't get to hear how it ended - at that moment the people running the interview came and tapped me on the shoulder and said it was time to go. I really wanted to hear how it ended.\n\nBut what a call for me to hear on my very first listening in at an interview xD I still hope I get it, as it's still miles better than my retail job. At least in this if I end up getting abusive customers, it's only over the phone. They won't be able to throw things at me like has happened in my current job a few times :/",

I call over there.\n\nLA = Lazy Ass\nMe = Me\n\nLA = Thank you for calling OtherDepartment, this is Lazy Ass, how can I help you?\n\nMe = Hey LA, this is JacobN43 in MyDepartment, is there a Team Leader I can speak to?\n\nLA = Nope, there isn't one available.\n\nMe = Supervisor?\n\nLA = Nope.\n\nMe = Manager?\n\nLA = Nope.\n\nMe = Anybody at all?\n\nLA = Nope.\n\nMe = You're telling me that if I walk all the way over to your department to talk to one of them nobody will be there?\n\nLA = Nope.\n\nMe = Okay, thanks! *click*\n\nAt this point I know he's full of it because I can see who's logged in and who's not (perks of being a Supervisor).  So I get my butt up and walk all the way across the building to his department.  Sure enough, there's their Team Leader, Supervisor, and Manager all at their desks working.  I decide to go straight for the Manager (M).\n\nMe = Hey M, can I talk to you in the hall for a moment?\n\nWe walk into the hall and I give him a brief rundown of what is happening; including the snarky response from LA.  M quickly slams open the door to their department.\n\nM = LA! Get over here, now!\n\nFortunately LA wasn't on a call.\n\nLA = What's up, M?\n\nM = I believe you met JacobN43; at least over the phone?\n\nLA = Shit...\n\nM = Yeah, he's a Supervisor over in his department.  I promise you he knows more about what's going on than you do.  What's this I'm hearing about you refusing to help a customer?\n\nLA = It's not our order.\n\nMe = Yes, it is.  I double checked everything after you sent it back to us the first time just to be sure.  It's yours.  There's no way it can be mistaken.  *Turning to M* I still have it up on my computer if you want to direct transfer it.\n\nM = Let's bring it up first just so I can verify. *He brings it up*  LA, go home.  You're suspended the rest of today, and the next two days.  This is the second time this has happened in as many days.  Next Monday when you come back we're going to have a long talk about your future with the company.\n\nWith a huge shit eating grin on my face I slowly backed out of the office and strutted back to my own department where we actually like to do our jobs.",

And I’m not a ma’am.”\n\nI explain that its just a polite salutation, and she goes “Well I don’t know what you Americans are being taught in call centres but Australians dont like being called Ma’am.” \n\n“&lt;name&gt;, this is the first time I’d had a complaint about being called Ma’am, again, just operating procedure to use a polite title.” \n\nLady: “Well, Australians don’t like to complain.”\n\nI chuckle, and respond, “I work in resolutions, we receive a lot of complaints.” \n\nLady: “Well, I am not American, I am British Australian, and I don’t like Americanisms, I watch a lot of movies and don’t like how you Americans do things.” \n\nAt this point it was just getting ridiculous and I was pretty much verbally shoving the customer out the door because I’d explained her bloody bill.

        "text": "I actually didn't want to post this, but felt I needed to rage about it a bit.  This is the reason I will be quitting my job, very soon.  Keep in mind, I was forced to change to this department but I thought it would be a good change, since I liked what I would be talking on the phones about...how wrong I was.\n\nI have received my first low scoring survey.  I have several others from this exact month it was taken, that were all 100s.  This is my first EVER low survey in over 4 years of working for my company.  (I think this was mainly due to luck)  I normally wouldn't mind getting a low survey score if I actually did something wrong...but this one...this takes the cake for me.  It stinks all the way around, and it being my first EVER low one?  Yeah, it had massive repercussions.\n\nDuring my training period on my new account, I get a guy calling into my phone line.  As soon as the girl realizes I am a girl, she starts basically try to make out with him while on the phone with me.  (I could hear her saying she didn't like him talking to a girl, and him saying to get off his lap he's trying to use the phone)  Suddenly, she rips the phone out of his hand and says it's HER account that has a problem - not his.  She's pissed off about some perceived slight against her, and is basically a complete moron.  Talking in that horrific valley girl voice that makes me want to claw my eyes out.  I barley have her account pulled up, and when I am explaining that she actually needs to download the product from a certain place...she skips ahead and does it herself.  You heard me right, the customer fixed her idiotic user error issue herself...AFTER I was on the phone all of 4 minutes.  (Note:  Most calls are 16+ minutes-2 hours.)  Seriously, she was downloading it incorrectly and mid-sentence of explaining to her how to fix it - it finally \"clicked\" in her tiny brain how to do it.  Whatever, I continue on with my happy cheerful self and say \"Wow!  That's amazing, good job!  Tha-\"  She hangs up on me.  I don't have a call back number (barely had the account open).  She was not a nice person and was screaming at me the whole time about how terrible of a company we are (and how stupid I am, oh the irony).  I still have no idea why she was pissed I was a girl, but whatever she's off my phone, life goes on....\n\nOne month later, I get ripped off of the phones.  I got a low survey.  I'm confused as my QAs are ALL 100s and I've never received a low survey in my entire career here.  I'm basically the best agent we have on our team, and have been told this numerous times by my bosses.  What happened on this call?\n\nI read the survey...you will LOVE what was said, this is a direct quote (because IDGAF anymore):\n\"The worker that I spoke to, FrostWhyteAngel, did not seem to know what she was looking for to help me. I ended up solving the problem on my own. After I had told her I had figured out my issue she hung up on me after a little snarle. I thought that was very rude.\"\n\nOh, man, I was pissed.  I don't snarl at people, and what does she mean I was rude?  I'm NEVER rude, I don't want to get fired.  I'm always a happy cheerful person or complete deadpan when they are yelling at me.  Didn't know what I was doing?  Huh?  That doesn't sound like me at all...\n\nWe listened to the call.  There was no snarl.  We checked to see who hung up: she hung up on me.  So, then we checked to see if I was rude.  Nope, cheerful self (odd considering she was acting like a lunatic in the beginning of the call).  Did I know what I was doing?  Yup, I even told her in the call how to do it...  The only thing my supervisor could tell me to try to fix for the future was to maybe not ask how to spell their email address out - even if it's long and complicated spelling.  OH MY GOD!  The bitch flat out LIED on that survey.\n\nSo, here's the jist.  I am NOW (months later) losing my $400 bonus for the month and basically going back to minimum wage due to this.  I am also being coached/ripped off the phones with no pay for it (1 hr) every 2 days to make sure I am doing everything correctly.  I am no longer getting my raise that I worked for 6 months to achieve.  I am no longer considered a top tier agent, that took over 8 months to get acknowledged for, which in turn means I cannot go after swapping departments like I wanted to do.  Oh, I'm pissed.  This is ALL because of that ONE survey.  It had a trickle effect.\n\nI went petty with this, as I was super pissed about what she said and how she basically took money out of my kids' mouths.  I don't suggest doing this, and DO suggest blocking your facebook from the outside world.  I looked her up.  She is a 24 yr old who dropped out of college and lived with her parents until 3 months ago.  Her parents have funded multiple expensive holiday trips for her and her boyfriend to enjoy.  Her parents actually pay for her apartment rent.  Her first job ever is as a barista that she recently started working - all of 2 weeks ago. What a spoiled, entitled, lying brat.  People like this piss me off, completely.  I haven't done anything TO her, but I was sorely tempted to...I decided to take the high road.\n\nI asked my team supervisor if there was anyway to over turn the survey - nope.  It stays.  I have decided I hate people, and am going to be quitting very shortly.  I HATE this job.  I enjoy helping people a lot, but...this was it for me.  I'm done.  I hit the wall.\n\nAnd...let the downvotes/shaming start.  I just needed to vent about this.  That the customer has ALL of the power and they shouldn't.  Like I said, I'm quitting.  My husband is in full support of my never working in customer support ever again, mainly due to hearing (yes, he can hear them screaming through my headset) how they talk to me.  He said this was the final straw.\n\nEdit:  Before you ask, no this is not the first bad thing that has happened...just the most recent and the most painful money-wise.  I'm just really over how this job and the customers treat me.  Also...she really did misspell \"snarl\".  That ticked me off, too...considering how she was yelling at ME being an idiot on the phone... It also turns out she held onto that survey for OVER a month and THEN sent it in.  She got my name not off of our original phone call, but based off of the email that *I* sent her.  FFS...some people...\n\nUpdate:  Our services went down for an hour or so the other day.  Last day I worked.  I took over 127 calls from customers that wanted 1/2 a penny discount, I usually only take around 35ish a day.  This was the killer for me, it cost these people MORE to call us...than it did to just WAIT until the alert went away.  The entitled comments, yelling, and personal attacks against me were the last straw for my dealing with customers.  There is also official confirmation that the pay has dropped down to $8.75 (barely above min wage).  I called out yesterday - missed my team meeting, and during said meeting my supervisor was quoted (and recorded) saying some not so nice things about me and others that are quitting/suspected of leaving.  I'm not giving 2 weeks notice, and I'll be reporting them to the Labor Board on Monday.",

I have no background in call centers or technical support roles on a professional level/office environment.\n\nSo basically for the first week all the newbies who got 1 week of crash-course training (3 days teaching us how to be nice to customers/deal with situations) and 2 days teaching us how to actually work the support ticket system and the actual software itself.\n\nUs new guys are not given the ability to remote assist, nor view the customer's screen to offer help. We have to just verbally guide people. Which is fine, because our job is to greet them, listen to them, ask them questions to isolate the issue &amp; things they've tried, and solve simple/common issues. If it's outside our scope of (limited) training, we transfer them to L2+ for further support (fully trained staff)\n\nI was expecting the worst, but the overall first day was relatively decent. My first call was a nightmare though....Screaming lady, on hold for an hour, transferred 4 times, 3-day ticket. Had to read up on her ticket notes and familiarize myself with her issue in about 30 seconds while she was screaming at me, at her friend, and her friend screaming at me from across the room. Nerve wracking for the very first call.\n\nMany of the issues were easily resolved, and I had to transfer a bunch of people I couldn't remote assist, people to sales/customer service.\n\nIt was a pretty draining day though, I didn't expect it to be so intense.",

However, there are just some skills that I did not know, but I would transfer the customer to someone who could help. Most reps were friendly about it, but one time I got a girl who was not nice about it. This is a story of me getting fed up with her shit.\n\nWe'll start with the customer talking to me first. Me will be me, and GC will be Graceful Customer.\n\nMe: Thank you for calling major entertainment company customer support. My name is PussySharts. How can I help you today?\n\nGC: Hi, my device isn't working properly. I am turning it on, but it won't load. It halts and gives me an error code.\n\nMe: That is quite a pickle. Unfortunately, I am in the billing department, so I don't have the training for your issue, but I can get you to someone in our accessory division. I just need to get some basic information from you before I do so.\n\nGC: Oh, alright. What do you need?\n\nMe: I'm going to need your account alias (again from previous submission there is a word, but saying what it is actually called will give my company away.)\n\nGC: It's *suchandsuch.*\n\nMe: I have loaded it in my system. I see there is one email and one phone number where I can send a validation code. I will try the phone.\n\n(click send to phone. Customer tells me he got a text message)\n\nGC: I got a text message, and it shows me a 5 digit code.\n\nMe: That was me. Save that for the next agent. I will try to get you over to the accessory division now. Please bear with me.\n\n(Hit the transfer button to get to accessory division. We will now add a new person to the story: Complete Turd, or CT)\n\nCT: Thanks for calling major company customer support. My name is Complete Turd. How can I help:\n\nMe: Hi CT, this is PussySharts from billing and I have a customer who says when he powers on his device, it halts and gives him an error.\n\nCT: Did you get the customer's email address for his account?\n\nMe: No, but I got his account alias and phone number. He is able to receive security codes, so he should be able to get it when you talk to him.\n\nCT: Unfortunately, I need the email address for his account. Without it, I won't be able to continue.\n\nMe: Yes, like I said though, if you search his account alias, you will find his account. He has one email and one phone number on file for his account. I sent a test security code to his phone number and he is able to receive it. When he gives it to you, it will show you his email address, and you can confirm it with him.\n\nCT (starting to get a little attitude at this point): Without the email address, I won't be able to help him. Please get it from him and send him back again. \n\n(We did a few more seconds of back-and-forth. In all fairness, the accessory department was notorious for dodging phone calls, even if it was their issue to take. They were also notorious for finding ways to pawn their customers onto other departments. I was getting fed up with this woman's attitude, which is why I did what I did next.)\n\nMe: You know what?! The customer's issue is an accessory issue. I can't help him as I don't have the training. I didn't get his email from him, but I did get his account alias and a text capable phone that he can get security codes to. With that info, you should be able to get his email. It is an accessory issue. You are taking the call - end of story!\n\n(before she could dodge, I mashed the buttons on the phone to bring the customer into the conference)\n\nMe (cheery voice again): Hi GC, I have Complete Turd from the accessory division. She will be assisting you further.\n\n(stab mute button, listen to accessory rep start talking to customer [still with a little bit of attitude], hit release.)\n\nAgain, the interaction I had with the transfer rep was out there, but I got tired of her attitude. It wasn't the first time a rep from that department tried to get out of a call. They were notorious for it, and I wasn't the only person they did it to. I felt like a boss when I told her she was taking the call whether she wanted to or not.",

        "text": "And I'm the happiest I have ever been!  The company I currently work for are the exact opposite of customer service.  They are customer service \"from a certain point of view\", as Obi-Wan might say.  And that point of view is number of calls answered within 60 seconds.\n\nThat may sound great to the uninitiated, but the upshot is we were never given time to handle any complex queries or complaints.\n\nTo provide context, we are an outsourcing company working for a major energy supplier in the UK.  One of the things our regulator has a hard-on for is complaints management.  Yet there is one fucking cunt in the company, a weasel given too much power, who is responsible for maintaining our service level agreement with the client.\n\nWhat this means is that if you need time to do some work on a complaint, it is automatically rejected.  And when the customer goes to the ombudsman, you're in the shit.  It is literally a no-win situation.  A toxic environment where you either ignore the weasel and get taken to HR, or your complaints go to the ombudsman and you go to HR.\n\nSo I'm leaving.  I've been offered a new job at a new place where there are no fucking complaints, it is entirely customer-oriented, arranging the delivery of services the customer had already paid for.\n\nAnd I can't fucking wait to get the fuck out of this dump.",

Over a year later, I have applied for several jobs and have not gotten any responses. I went back to college in a new state and applied to a call center and was so close to getting the job. The only problem was availability and transportation. I'm thinking of going back home and back to the call center I got fired from (its a vendor site) and working a new campaign. Then eventually I would like to work from home. It was difficult, exhausting work. The day before I got fired I had stomach and back pain just thinking about going in there. I always wanted to cry just walking in the door. But I feel like I have no other options. School or no school, I feel like it's the only thing I'm even remotely good at since you get several weeks of training and they don't expect you to come in with any previous knowledge. My mom even works in a call center and she has a degree that wasn't even required for her job and has been there several years and seems to like it. But anyway, if I do go back, how can I make it a better experience than last time?",

        "text": "Bare with me with my formatting or spelling since I am doing this off of my smartphone. \n\nRecently I was hired onto a call center that has some questionable practices. I came from  as a Product support rep 1 to here as a PS2. I understand that practices will be different between companies but this has me a bit worried.\n\nThe company specializes in trucking loadboards(I'll leave out the company name for good reasons) and my job is to troubleshoot people/computers that can't access our product or aren't working right. During my training I felt that the call center was at least 15 years behind, using outdated phones that require lots of effort to work right, and half of the training material was wrong/not there. I guess I'm used to a company that has the right tools and training for their reps. During the initial interview I expressed that my previous job had no way of tracking breaks and lunch, and would constantly harass me when the system glitched and didn't take me out of break aux. I was assured in the interview that they have a system that will track it that I can use, but once I signed on, I found out that was a lie.\n\nThe unnerving part is that our main database isn't protected at all. Logins are lax and passwords are worse. One admin access is as easy as (you guessed it) 'admin:password' or '&lt;first letter of name&gt;&lt;last name&gt;. As someone who is studying network security, this sends red flags going off in my head. \n\nOn top of that, I noticed today that they print off, scan, and re-email out a list of everyone's login and logout times, in this list it clearly shows who is on time and not. Now, I don't have an issue with getting to work on time, and I understand schedule compliance, but putting everyone's login/out times on blast to the center, seems unethical. \n\nWhat do you guys feel? Am I just in shock from going from a relaxed center to a different one? Or should I actually be concerned? Also, post the most unethical thing you have seen in a call center.",

I was in the billing department, but I also had some basic tech skills.\n\nAnyway, I put in my notice and was getting ready to leave my job. I was working on a Tuesday and my last day was Thursday, so I only had 3 more days.\n\nI got this call on that Tuesday. In the call, the customer was trying to reset the password for his account, but the account wasn't set up with his information. Me will be me, and ID will be Idiot:\n\nMe: Thank you for calling *major company* customer support. My name is PussySharts. How can I help you tonight?\n\nID: Yes, I forgot the password for my account and I need to reset it. \n\nMe: Alright, let me see what I can do to help you with that. Can I start by getting the account alias? (We had a real term for it in-house, but saying it here would give away who I worked for, although I have a feeling the rest of the post will make it glaringly obvious anyway.)\n\nID: The alias is *(hell if I remember).*\n\nMe: I have punched in the alias, and the system has found it. Before I can proceed with assisting you in the password reset, it would be best to validate the account. The way I do that is by sending a security code to either the email or phone number on file for the account. The code would be read to me, and I would punch it in. Until then, I won't be able to see any info on the account. \n\nID: I didn't know that. That may be an issue, because the account was set up by my cousin, and he used his email and phone number. \n\nMe: When I look at the options here, I see that there is one email and one phone number that I can send the code to. Are you sure that neither of them are yours? \n\nID: I am sure that neither of them are mine. I was with my cousin when he made the account and I know what information he used. We made it years ago and the info never changed. \n\nMe: Are you sure you don't remember the password used? Are you sure you didn't write it down somewhere?\n\nID: We never wrote it down. Do you have to send the security code to the email on file? Can't I give you an email send it to?\n\nMe: Well, if it worked that way, that would defeat the purpose of the security threshold we put in place (it really would, btw). Is your cousin there right now to help you?\n\nID: No, he is an hour away. Look, we've been going on for a while now. Isn't there just a way that you can just reset the password for me and send me on my way?\n\nMe: Unfortunately, I don't have that ability, neither do my coworkers. Even if I did, I would still have to validate the account with the security code, which we have been unable to do thus far. I can try sending it to the phone on file if that would help.\n\n(I click send to phone and get a message in my help tool, \"Phone number incapable of receiving texts\".)\n\nMe: I just tried the phone, and it said that the number can't receive texts.\n\nID: We set it up before either of us had cells, so it was probably his house phone. \n\nMe: Tell you what, have you tried resetting it online? I can help you with that without having to validate the account in my system. Chances are you could use the email, phone number, or secret ? to regain access. The website can even give you a password reset code by phone call, something I am unable to do.\n\nID: We tried that earlier. The phone number is no longer valid, the email doesn't work, and we can't remember the secret question. \n\nMe: Have you tried going to the website of the email address and resetting the password there? If you can reset the password to the email and regain access, then you can get a password reset link for our site sent to that email.\n\nID: We tried that, and we were unable to reset the email password. \n\n(mute, choke self with headset cord for a few seconds.)\n\nID: Hello, are you still there?\n\nMe: Yes, I had to sneeze. Anyway, if the number is invalid, the secret question is forgotten, and the email password can't be reset, you can still click on \"these options don't work.\" You can fill out a form and our system, upon determination of you providing enough info, will send you a password reset link to an email of your choice. This will allow you to reset the password and update the account with **your info.** (Technically, I should've spoke to his cousin since it was set up with his information, but I was willing to try to help anyway.)\n\nID: This is getting frustrating. I don't see why you can't just change the password for me. I am paying for your service, and you won't do this simple thing for us. I don't see why you can't change the email and phone number on file.\n\nMe: As I explained earlier, none of us in this center are able to change the password. Neither are the agents at other *company* call centers. To be able to change the email and phone number, I would need to send you a security code via the *current* email or phone on the account. Neither of those options worked to validate you. Even if it did, and I did change the email and phone, it would only change where future security codes for phone support go if you call in the future, allowing the validation process to be faster. It wouldn't help you at all in changing your password. \n\nID: So is there nothing I can do? Am I screwed?\n\nMe: I explained that there are three options. You can get with your cousin and try to reset the password for the email address associated with this account. Once you get the email address password reset, you can send the password reset link there and reset your account password reset. Your second option is to go back to the password reset site, click on \"these options don't work\", fill out the form and have the reset link sent to an email of your choice, or call us back if that option failed and we would assist further. Your last option is to fill out the password reset form with me on the phone, and I can guide you through it and assist with whatever result you get from it. Which of those options sounds best for you? I am willing to help you with the form as that is looking like our best option at the moment.\n\nID: This is ridiculous. All I want is my password reset for my account that I am paying for. I don't see why you can't just have your stupid security code sent somewhere else. I don't see why you can't just change the password for me. I don't see why you can't just tell me the password on the account. **You aren't very helpful at all!! You are useless!!**\n\nMe: (I have been called useless before, and I would just calmly rebut with an apology, a final explanation of policy and how this is for their benefit. Since I was three days away from leaving and this call went past the time that quality would review it, I said, more like **barked**, back at ID): **Well, I'm sorry you feel that way!!**\n\nID: Whatever. *click*\n\nMe: (stab mute button with finger) Pinhead!\n\nI was just glad that my team manager didn't hear that, or she would've given me a talking to. I wasn't afraid of quality reviewing it and coaching me, because we went in circles for 25 minutes. Quality only reviewed calls &lt;20 minutes. I wasn't afraid of him giving me a nasty survey, because surveys were done by **email**. If there was only one email on the account and he couldn't access it, then I am safe. \n\nI will acknowledge that the way I acted at the end was unprofessional. I just consider it a slap in the face when I do what I can to help, and not only am I rejected, but I am verbally attacked. I even offered to stay on the phone and help him with a password reset form, even though it would've taken me off the phone and made me unavailable to help new customers calling in. I just got annoyed, and since I was leaving anyway, I didn't care. \n\nThat is my story. Just for anyone wondering, I don't feel bad about the way I acted toward the end, nor do I feel bad about barking at the customer. I didn't lose any sleep over it, and I still don't feel guilty. That's my two cents. I apologize for the long read, but reading the whole story adds depth to what I dealt with that night. ",

        "text": "I loved this call and thought I would share with you all.\n\nWe have the ability to ban our customers from using our services if they overstep their bounds of our \"rules\".  It's actually not my department that handles these calls, it's an entirely different department...but people call us to speak to someone to usually vent about what is happening to them.  I completely understand, and am more than willing to listen to their story.  This is one of those days where I was ecstatic that I had listened carefully to a story.\n\n80 year old man calls in and is telling me about how when he tried to access our service, it warned him that he was banned/suspended from our service.  I am immediately concerned that this might be an \"angry call\" due to people generally getting upset about it.  Surprisingly, it was not.  Here is the jist of what happened:\n\nHim:  \"I just tried to sign into your XYZ service and it is telling me I am banned/suspended!\"  (I can't remember which was the case, sorry)\n\nMe:  \"Oh that's terrible!  Did you happen to get one of the 3 emails that Other Section of Company sent to you, warning you of this?  In those emails, they actually detail your next steps to take to regain control of your account.\"\n\nHim:  \"I did!  I am so happy I read them too!  I know exactly what happened!\"\n\nMind you, I was actually being listened to live by two trainers, my team leader and close to 20 other \"new agents\" in training.  So, they ALL got to hear this awesome story.\n\nHim: \"I am absolutely sure it's because of that kid that told me to 'STFU Nerd!  I couldn't believe he called me a nerd!!!\" (Note: not upset about the STFU, at all...just the nerd part...and he spelled out all of the acronyms for me...I don't think he knew what they stood for)\n\nMe: \"Oh, I see, did you happen to report him?\"\n\nHim: \"Actually, I didn't.  I responded to his message and told him I am going to kill the little bastard.\"  (Well, that escalated quickly...)\n\nMe: \"Oh, well then you are probably right...that is most likely why you were banned/suspended.\"  (I am trying not to laugh, because he basically told a kid he'd kill him....)\n\nHim: \"Yeah, then he responded with IDGAF old man!  So, I responded with: 'I will borrow my neighbor's pen1s and skull f*ck you to death!\"  (By now, my other headset is lit up with people laughing SO hard, the old man was dead serious when he said this and truly upset...so I am trying valiantly not to laugh.)\n\nMe: \"Wow!  I understand completely now!  You would definitely need to speak to Other Section of Company to get this completely straightened out.\"\n\nHim: \"No, no.  I just want you to look up the little sh!t's account and make sure he was banned/suspended too!  It's not fair that I would get (whatever consequence) and he would get nothing!\"\n\nMe: \"Sir, I cannot look up another individual's account to see if they are reaping the consequences of your conversation.  I can only access the accounts that are in front of me and only with that exact customer on the phone.  We are required to verify every person we speak to for security purposes.\"\n\nHim: \"I understand.  I'm just upset that I might of been punished and he wasn't.\"\n\nThen...we had a nice chat about life, laughing about the situation and he hung up.\n\nSo there you have it.  An old man told a kid he'd kill him and skull f*ck him to death with his neighbor's pen!s.  There was also a mention of something to the kid about his mother too, but I forget exactly what he said.\n\nEveryone thought it was hysterical, and the guy on the phone took the news like a champ and thought it was funny too.",

May I have the mobile number you're calling in regards to? \n\nHim: You should have that information, just pull it up. \n\nMe: I'm sorry sir, since you didn't put it in to the automated system when you called in,  I don't have that information.\n\nThen he gave it to me way too fast, I could barely understand him. Of course it was my fault when I asked him to repeat himself. \n\nMe: Thank you, and may I ask who I'm speaking with today? \n\nHim: You already have my information! Just pull it up! \n\nMe: Sir, we only partner with [carrier]. We don't have access to their systems.\n\nDude! I'm trying to help you! Why are you being a dick? \n\nAfter verifying his name, I asked him for a good contact number. \n\nHim: Who am I calling right now? \n\nMe: Uhh... [company name]?

So I go into autopilot and just regurgitate my scripting for the rest of the call, although getting any information from him was like pulling teeth. \n\nUntil... \n\nMe: There will be a deductible of $175 and we do offer next business day shipping-\n\nHim: Wait, what?  That's bullshit.  Why the fuck do I have insurance?\n\nMe: Well without the insurance, you'd have to pay the full retail price to replace your phone. Since you do have coverage you only have to pay the deductible.\n\nHim: No, no, no. Listen here you little bitch,  I'm not paying 175 fucking dollars for a phone I already paid for. Cancel my account now. And get all my fucking information back from the lost phone. \n\nMe: Sir, once again we only partner with [carrier]. You'll have to contact them to cancel your service, and they may be able to assist you with recovering your information. \n\nHim: So what the fuck do you do? \n\nMe: I just handle the insurance claims.\n\nHim: No you little bitch, you're going to cancel it. Now. \n\nMe: Once again, I don't have access to their systems. \n\nHim: I want to talk to your fucking supervisor.\n\nI got him transferred to the escalations queue and the lady sitting across from me took it. When she answered it and it was me she peeked over the cubicle at me and started laughing. I'm glad she had a sense of humor about it because I was 500% done.",

        "text": "I have been reading this subreddit for a VERY long time, and am just starting to post some of my own stories.\n\nTwo weeks ago, I had a normal call with a normal issue.  It was a billing issue, of course.  Guy wanted to cancel his service and I was more than willing to do so.  Mid-cancelling his service, the guy hung up on me.  (I can tell when they hang up, on my phone it says \"inbound disconnected\". If it was an accident, it SOUNDS like an accident...not him saying something then a very quiet click.) I immediately called him back (as we are told to do if they are not angry).  He was strangly really calm and trying to sound completely professional all of a sudden...the tone of the entire call changed immediately.\n\nMid-sentence of attempting to explain how I had cancelled his service for him....THIS post reminded me of something:  https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromcallcenters/comments/2xvr69/i_found_a_grade_a_cunt_the_idea_is_to_scare_them/\n\nI remembered reading in the original thread that was linked, that people use google voice to record received calls.  In order to do so with tech support/call centers, they hang up mid call and make the person call them back.\n\nAfter stopping mid-sentence, I then asked if I was suddenly being recorded.  Bingo, yes I am...and it's ONLY so he knows for sure I am actually cancelling his service (why would I lie about that, is beyond me.  It's just a simple click and easy to do).  I disconnected the call as soon as he decided to 1) admit he was recording now and purposefully hanging up to do so, and 2) refused to stop the recording.\n\nIn my company, I do not EVER give my permission to be recorded.  Why would he even have bothered trying to record me over such a simple issue, too, is beyond me.  Yes, he did mention the original Comcast cancel call...and our call was actually nothing like that.  We don't TRY to keep you with our company.  We list our perks, ask why (for records really, it asks us to put something in there), and then do what the customer asks - we cancel it.  I cancelled, he can check to make sure I did on our website.  It was pointless...it was not like he was mad or anything.  We were having a nice, friendly little chat.\n\nSo, yes, it saved me.  Good thing I read that entire thread, as I completely forgot before then that people could use google voice to record incoming calls.\n\nAlso, in that original thread some of you mentioned that when someone immediately starts in asking for your name, agent id, where you live, etc, that it will be a difficult call.  That it is a red flag.  I had one of these.  Little boy called me and in the background the dad was coaching him on what to ask me for \"their recording\" (which I distinctly heard in the background!).  I had to disconnect that call too.  Also, another simple issue that was mostly fixed at the time within 3 minutes of the call...what is the point to recording such simple things?!  Yes, it was a hellish 3 minutes for me...and they argued with me about everything (why am I arguing with your kid to get to you?).  It immediately turned into a \"disaster call\" as soon as they started asking for MY information.\n\nDear customers, I cannot give you my personal information.  Even if I could, you would NEVER be able to figure out who I am.  My entire name is somewhat common, and my agent id is completely worthless.  Knowing where I live, does you nothing.  I work at home, and even if I did give you my address...I dare you to show up.  I have a shotgun sitting on top of my front door.\n\nAlso, please stop putting your 6 year old on the phone.  They aren't cute and take extra long to explain to them, and teaching them how to \"treat\" call center employees is not a valid excuse.  WHY is your 6 yr old on the phone with me about your MONEY issue?!  I don't want you coaching them in the background, I want to speak to YOU.  Not your kid.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromcallcenters/comments/3lnqzg/the_system_wont_let_me_refund_you/",
        "text": "That is my go-to response for when I feel like I would be breaking policy to refund you (thus putting my job on the line) or if I feel like you are straight up lying to me to get a refund (I DO listen to you when you speak to me, dear customer, and if your story changes...I will notice).\n\nI shall tell the two stories of my refund woes from this week.  They were both pretty bad.\n\n1 - The 19 yr old that tried to bully me into a refund, via lying.\n\nPeople call in all of the time wanting refunds, but if you use something for 28 days out of the allotted 30 days - I cannot refund you.  Repeat.  I cannot refund you.  I would get fired if I did, and my job is more important than the screaming.  Talking sh!t about me to other people in the room breaks my \"give a sh!t\" button immediately.  I am no longer cheery with you and immediately go into \"super serious mode\".\n\n19ish yr old calls me and claims that his bank account just today tried to charge him for something that has been trying to charge for over 3 weeks.  I tell him that this could be due to the \"pending status\" in his bank account, and depending on the bank...can take a long time to clear.  We started trying to charge him beginning of August.  I can see that he has been using our service.  So, he basically wants the service for free.\n\nAt first, of course, it was a sob story.\n\nHim:  \"Didn't know it would charge me!!!\"\n\nMe:  \"Sir, hasn't it been charging you every month for over 2 years now on the same exact date?\"\n\nHim:  \"Yes, but I am in college...and went on vacation for 3 weeks.\"\n\nMe:  \"Sir, you can always check your balances and transactions on our website.\"\n\nHim:  \"I don't feel like that should be my responsibility.\"\n\nMe:  \"Sir, this is completely up to our customers to monitor their spending habits and their bank accounts.\"\n\nThis is where the whole story starts to change, yet again.  He went from sob story in outright bullying because he wasn't getting his way.  Over the course of a maybe 35 minute conversation of explaining why he was being charged for a service he was using...he dropped the \"well, YOU personally should have to pay for my usage out of YOUR paycheck\".  Fat chance of that.  Good luck trying to get me to physically pay for you using our service.\n\nHim:  \"Well, I cancelled it so it wouldn't recharge me these past two months!!\"\n\nMe: \"Actually, I can see on here exactly when it has tried to charge and for how long it has been a recurring charge.  You actually cancelled it today, in fact.\"  (My way of calling him a liar without outright saying it)  \"And, since this month is almost over and you have used 28 days of our service out of 30 days, it is a legit charge...and the system won't let me refund it for you.\"  (I actually cannot see this, but he kept changing the story on it...he cancelled it, he didn't cancel it.  He did but it was 2 weeks before it should have charged.  He did but it was 2 weeks AFTER it was charged.  It changed a lot and he was looking for our policy on it.)\n\nHe asked for a supervisor when he realized I was stonewalling with him.  Asking for my supervisor does not help you either, as my supervisor has the same access and same policies that I have.  We even have a nice little giggle about the situation before I transfer you over to them.\n\nAlso, said guy decided to talk badly about me while I was attempting to transfer him and I had to remind him that I could still hear him.  He tried to cover the phone with his hand so I couldn't hear after that, but I could still hear.  I didn't even bother warning him again.\n\n2 - The pretend military guy with serious yelling and control issues.\n\nGet a call from a supposed active duty military family, turns out later after doing some quick checking...not military (no surprise there).  My husband is active duty military and has made a career out of it - so I can check this easily.  Dear Customers, I can see all of your information in my system - even your social.  Do not try to play mind games with me.  I KNOW if you are military or not - my system TELLS me.  Lying about it, makes me NOT want to refund you even more.  Stolen valor anyone?\n\nHis wife calls and speaks to me first.  This time they have used the service for 29 days out of 30.  They were once again miraculously charged that same day they were calling me.  (This is VERY rare - like so rare I should NEVER EVER hear about this - and if it happens, I can see it in my system. Shouldn't take an ENTIRE month for a charge to go through...it was not a declined charge either, and according to my system went through on day 3...so...I know when they are lying to me)  \n\nAnyways, I am explaining why the system cannot let me refund for her...and suddenly he grabs the phone from her and is screaming into my ear.  I *hate* that.  He starts ranting and raving about how he is military.  I should feel sympathy for him being military.  We are a military family.  I feel bad he is paying for it, if he didn't use it, but he did and he has ZERO right to treat me like garbage because of it.\n\nHim: \"Well, you can check and see how long I have been a user of XYZ company!  GO AHEAD AND LOOK! TELL ME WHAT YOU SEE!\"\n\nMe: \"I see that you have been a valuable member for 4 or more years.\"\n\nHim:  \"Exactly, I know that your company prorates services.  I know your policies better than you do!  I know how this works!  I will call back in and go up the chain of command to get to the highest of the high, and get my refund!  When I speak to them, I will refer them back to this call and tell them to listen to this call.  The way you have treated me is disrespectful and the reason I am leaving your company!  I want you to completely cancel everything on my account, NOW!\"  (Note: We don't prorate services EVER.  It's never even been an option to do.  So, I absolutely know he is completely full of it and has no idea what he is saying.  Plus, Idgaf how long you have been a member.  It has no bearing on my being able to refund you or not.  With how long our company has been in service, 4 years is a drop in the bucket.)\n\nMe:  \"In all of my years of working here, I have never once seen a prorate on an account, it is not physically possible to do so. It is also certainly within your rights to cancel your service with us today.  Did you want me to remove your service and any payment options on your account as well?\"  (I said this completely deadpan, and I was unfazed with his tactics)\n\nHim: \"You do that!  I will just call back in a couple of a days and GET my refund!\"\n\nCancels all of our services, which still had at least 3 more days on it before running out.  Removes all credit cards off of the account.  Little does he know, once you remove the payment method...no refund can be issued afterwards.  It will lock the system up completely.  So, while before he might of had a chance for a refund...not so anymore!\n\nMe:  \"Sir, I have removed all of your payment methods off of the account and have cancelled your service with us.  I can only suggest at this point forwards that you might be able to do a charge back with your bank.\"\n\nHim: \"Well, why should I have to do that?  This is YOUR responsibility!  I am going to speak to your supervisor and I will tell them what horrible customer service I have received today!\" (Ha, right.  Not my responsibility, at all.) \"YOU are the reason we are cancelling our service immediately!  I should not have to call up my bank just because some lowly little girl is telling me I can't have my deserved refund!\"  (I sometimes sound like I am 15....but way older than that)\n\nMe:  \"Sir, my supervisors have the same access to the system that I do.  The other agents will have the same issue processing your refund.  It will give them an error every single time.\"  (It won't, but they won't refund it if they are smart after reading my notes and checking their refund policies. After removing the payment methods, it will glitch on them.)  I also said this line with subtle sarcasm, because at that point it was getting harder to maintain my \"I'm here to help you\" attitude.\n\nHim: \"I know how this works!  I will keep calling in and going up the chain until I get my refund! ARGGHH!\" (Or something that sounded like a full yell...can't really describe it.)\n\nHe hung up after that in a rage and it actually took me a while to notice he hung up...\n\nSide note:  I have gotten QA'd a total of 12 times in the last 14 days.  All were 100%s...so...yeah....pretty sure this isn't me.\n\nAlso, here's a tip.  I use the electricity bill as a fantastic example for these calls.  \"Think of it this way...if you sign up for electricity to come to your house and you use it.  Do you still need to pay it?  The answer to that is yes.  Even if you only used it a little, or not so much...you still need to pay for what you used and what you signed up for.  If you are ever unsure about your cost or how much you will be charged, you can always sign into our website at any time to check it.\"\n\nGranted in our job, it doesn't matter if they used it or not.  If you have a 30 day service, we absolutely cannot refund you.  End of story.  If you sign up for a longer service, we *might* be able to if we are nice and catch it quickly - as in within a day of the original charge quickly.  Otherwise, you're outta luck.  Don't sign up for something and then expect to get it for free when you are completely done using it.\n\nBonus story:  Had a 14 year old wanting to get something fixed.  The shipping fee was a total of $3.  He wanted me to pay for this out of my own pocket, when I explained that is not possible or logical...he asked for a sup.  Mid-transfer, he hung up.  That wound up being a 2 hr 25 minute call, and involved a 3 way call to Fedex...I was not amused.  Especially when him and the Fedex guy are talking garbage about me to each other.  Not cool Fedex guy, not cool.",

        "text": "So, on Monday I started working in the head office of a major collections agent in Glasgow. \n\nThe experience have been superb compared to my last call centre job. \n\nMy training is 1 on 1. There are only around 20 agents in this particular team. Everyone is happy to be in their job and everyone has been so friendly. We get fruit baskets delivered daily to the office and there's a real warmth around the place. \n\nThere's no average handling time. No electronic scheduling system. And the pay/bonus regime is higher than my last role. No AHT basically means I can stay on the line to a customer for as long as I need to get things resolved. No scheduling means that I can fairly space my breaks out to accommodate sensible bathroom breaks and vaping with no 4 hour gap between breaks. \n\nMy debt recovery role is more customer orientated than my previous customer services role; it's all about the customer - there's no harassment for people to pay as long as they are willing to accept they have a problem and are willing to work with us to fix their finances, and the majority of it is attempting to find affordable solutions to people in serious debt with the energy company  and doing financial circumstance assessments before even asking for money. \n\nYeah, the role may require more stressful situations, but the actual stress is lower due to the happiness of the people in the office. There's no feeling of big brother company over our backs, and the effort the company puts in to our welfare (paying for social events/nights out/dinners).\n\nI can also safely leave items in the fridge without them being touched because of how office like the place and how high the employment criteria is. \n\nAlso, to note, we're in the UK where energy companies can't actually cut the power on domestic customers and where everything financial is regulated as to not cause any detriment to the customer. \n\nI'm based in the head office where HR/Payroll/Training/CEO are based, so I understand my experience may be different from the call centres owned by the company. \n\nRight now, though, I can say that this is how customer service should be and not the bullshit that my last outsourcing employer pushed as 'customer service' with a 5 minute call time.",

I'm the primary help desk coordinator for the conventions of a large company that makes graphic design and marketing software. Pretty much all questions related to attending their conferences- one in the fall and one in the spring- go through me. \n\nI've worked worse events, because most of these attendees are minimally computer literate at least, but sometimes I still get a bona fide derp. We will call her Belligerent Mac User (BMU). \n\n\n**BK**: Thank you for calling (Fall Event) Registration Support, my name is BaadKitteh, how may I help you?\n\n\n**BMU**: (a bunch of information I already know about my own conference) and when I go to my portal to check my schedule, it keeps trying to make me register again. \n\n\n**BK**: (takes her name and gets her account pulled up. She has created 2 accounts, and is signed in with the one she didn't register with. I explain that and walk her through clearing her cache and cookies in Safari so she can get to a sign in screen and enter the correct log in information.)\n\n\n**BMU**: It's still automatically taking me to the registration when I click to sign in! \n\n\nNow, for anyone who doesn't understand, a site simply cannot hold your login information to keep you signed in if you have completely cleared the cache and cookies from the browser. It just doesn't work that way, ever, not even in Safari. Even saving your form data will take you to a log in page where you have to actually sign in, not bypass it. \n\n\n**BK**: I'm sorry but we must not be getting  your cache cleared properly if you are still signed in. The browser cannot keep you signed in with a fully cleared cache and all cookies deleted. (Explain step by step how to clear again; trust me you don't want me to type this out).\n\n\n**BMU**: I already did this before I called you and I just did it again! I tried in IE (*groan*) at work yesterday! The website is messed up!\n\n\n**BK**: I apologize that you're having difficulty; do you have another browser you can try, such as Firefox or Chrome? (I just wanted something she'd never used to enter her login.)\n\n\n**BMU**: I don't want to put that virus crap on my Mac! I only use Safari! \n\n\n**BK**: OK, I have another solution. (I ended up just moving her registration information to the account under the email that she was signed in with because it was obvious she wasn't willing to do what it took to actually resolve the issue. It took a bunch of explanation but it worked.)\n\n\n**BMU**: OK, now I want to register for (peripheral activity that sold out the day it was announced, 2 days ago).\n\n\n**BK**: I'm sorry, that event sold out within an hour of the notifications being sent. \n\n\n**BMU**: BUT THE WEBSITE WAS MESSED UP! I TRIED TO REGISTER AND IT DIDN'T WORK! I EMAILED YOUR SUPPORT AND YOU DIDN'T HELP ME! \n\n\n**BK**: (quick search of email inbox) I'm afraid the only email we have received from you was an \"Out of Office\" autoresponse on the 10th.\n\n\n**BMU**: Well, I emailed (person I've never heard of), she sent me the invitation. I'm going to be really pissed off if I don't get to go to (peripheral event) because this was your guys' website and error that kept me from registering!\n\n\n**BK**: Actually the issue was your log in information. There was no problem with the website other than you being logged in under the wrong account. \n\n\n**BMU**: NO BECAUSE I CLEARED MY CACHE AND IT DIDN'T WORK! IT IS YOUR WEBSITE DATABASE NOT WORKING! (lolwut) YOU HAVE TO LET ME REGISTER!\n\n\n**BK**: Well there are no available seats as far as I have been informed, but please send an email request to our support box and I will ask project management if there's any way to fit you in. (This is how we handle anyone being a pain in the ass. The company I'm supporting is notoriously accommodating and people generally get what they want, no matter how much I'd like to tell them no when they are assholes. To be clear, I will bend over backwards for you if you don't yell, lie to me, and treat me like an idiot. I actually like helping people who are respectful.)\n\nShe then made me wait with her on the phone while she typed the email- took a long time for 2 lines- and sent it to verify I had received it. She said in the email \"There was a technical error which caused my registration not to go through.\" so I made sure to add my own commentary when I forwarded it. I'm just waiting to see now if I get to butt heads with her again, because I'm 100% positive she will call again to yell if we can't get her into the event. \n\n\n*sorry about the formatting; I tried putting in doublespaces and it didn't help at all.

        "text": "I used to work for a call center, started about ten years ago, got fired about five years ago.  This caller was about halfway into my stint there.  I worked with three different clients, tech support for a major computer peripherals company, billing and support for a major cell phone company, and tech support for a major gaming console company.  This call is for the cell phone company.\n\nI get this person who calls in, and is already upset from the get go.  I get her account up through verification, and ask what the issue is.  She's upset because she's expecting a credit because she thinks we messed something up.  On the account notes, the first thing that shows up is a supervisor saying that no more credits are to be applied, the customer has received all that she's going to get.  Since there is a ton of notes, I ask the customer what happened.\n\nAccording to her (my fuzzy memory, but I think it's about), she was supposed to have a text plan on her account, but no data usage.  In order for no data to be used, we have to block anything that uses data, including picture texting.  I do see that there are blocks in place to prevent all data charges, and I advise her that we have the blocks in effect.  However, she's upset because that wasn't always the case.  And this caused her to have data charges that she wasn't expecting.  And she was supposed to have credits applied to her account as a result.\n\nWell, like I mentioned, there are tons of notes in the system.  So I request the chance to review the account, and see what happened.  I'm very much aware that people generally tend to not go into an account and really do research, they'd rather just throw credits at the customer and get rid of them.  So I do review the account, making sure I note where there are credits, and for what.  And where there are charges, and for what.  All in all, this took me a little bit of time.  But the customer was patient, because I kept her apprised of what I was doing.  Eventually I got to the current bill (this was the third or fourth bill on her account I had to review, but there was a LOT of activity to go through).\n\nAfter all was said and done, it looked like the customer was indeed supposed to have certain charges waived/credited.  And they were.  It was confusing, but when I went through each charge and credit, I could see that we have actually given her a credit too many, and made sure that all of her charges were properly accounted for.  It looked like the previous supervisors and agents had just not gone over the credits with her, so it was confusing to her.\n\nI came back to her and advised her of the over-credit.  She wasn't buying it, and wanted me to send her copies of her bills.  However, that would have involved a charge to her, so I advised her that she could look online.  I also told her, if she could log in now, I could easily go over and explain every charge and credit involved in her situation.  She agreed, and logged into her online account.\n\nIt involved a lot of back and forth conversation between us.  I had to have her use pen and paper to put down each charge, and beside it, the credit associated.  It was still a bit confusing at first, but as time went on, I was able to show her how to read her bill and understand it.  With that, things got much easier, and she was better able to understand the charges.  I was also able to show her where each credit was located, whether on the bill with the charge, or on the next bill.  Over time, she was able to see where the charges were being neutralized by the credits, and acknowledged that we were making progress.\n\nBy the end of the whole process, she was able to see how we had given her the extra credit.  She wasn't thrilled to see that her balance wasn't going to be adjusted, but she was happy to see that we had given her all the credits owed.  And was very happy that I had spent the time with her educating her.  It also helped that I was able to show her how to view her bills online, and her current charges as well.  Due to my patience with her, I was able to educate her and help make her far more satisfied than anyone who had just thrown credits at her.  She had started the call, thinking we were just bullsh.tting her, and ended it thanking me for all the help I had provided.  Due to me, she said she was going to continue with the company, rather than cancel, like she had originally planned.\n\nTLDR: Customer called thinking she was owed credits on her bill.  Left understanding her bill, and understanding that we had actually over-credited her account.  Decided to not cancel her service like she originally planned on doing.  Patience is king, when the customer allows it.",

He opened with, \"yes, I'd like to make a complaint against your no good service, it's been AWFUL trying to deal with this\", and started going on a rant. I usually don't interrupt customers, but I hate wasting my time and their's by letting them list off complaints when I have no way to take them down or file them. So I butted in and said, \"I'm sorry you had that experience sir, let me transf....\" when he cut me off and said, \"NO, You're going to sit here and listen to what your company has done to ME and you're going to take this complaint\"\n\nSuper rude, am I right? Like who even talks to people that way? I tried to say once more, \"But sir, I don't have any means of...\" and I once again got cut off with, \"NO, Sit down and listen\". So I decide I'll listen. I lower the volume and sit back and relax for ten minutes while this guy rants and raves without a single interruption from me other than an occasional \"mhhhhm\". \n\nFinally, after ten minutes, he finishes and goes, \"Did you get all that down?

I had problems sending/receiving MMS, which isn't that good for needed group messages.\nI took it inside the Print store to see if they could fix it. They soft-reset it, and it worked! For a day.\nRepeat process, they hard-reset it. It worked.\nThen stopped four days later.\nSo I called Support after also realising that the rep had also changed my plan to the iPhone plan and I was getting a fee.\nThey tried fixing it, but I was so irritated that I ended up yelling some pretty vulgar things, because I wasn't being listened to.\nSo I just want to apologise that I was having a very very hard time with a new phone that I had bought barely two weeks before.\nAs an ex-call-center worker, I know how terrible it is to get someone that yells at you for something that isn't your fault.\nSo, I'm sorry! I don't remember your name but you didn't deserve that!",

        "text": "Alright, so I've been perusing this subreddit for quite some time now and I think it's finally time to post one of my good stories from my call center experience. \n\nI worked at a call-center in the U.S. for a major consumer tech company that happens to share a name with a fruit. I was basically front-line customer service. Now, it's good to mention that if people are having issues with one particular service from this company, we have to cold-transfer them over to a completely different department. We have absolutely no ability to service any of those calls. Now, this department is relatively small (considering the volume of calls they get) and they don't have their own number, so customers have to go through us first to get over to them. With that being said, here's the call that made me quit: \nPM = Me, C = (Cunt)stomer\n\nPM: Thank you for calling soandso, my name is PM_Me_Your_ToeHair, how can I help you? \n\nC: I *gasp* have tried *gasp* calling *gasp* three times now *gasp* and I have been *gasp* placed on hold *gasp* for over *gasp* a whole hour *gasp* and I want to get this *gasp* fixed *gasp* NOW!\n\nPM: *aww shit one of these*\n\nI'm so sorry about that m'am, what are you having issues with? \n\nC: **loudly tells me about some really simple problem that is dealt with the other department**\n\nPM: Okay, I understand what's going on. Let me outline a little bit of what's going to happen. Like you've probably experienced in the past, I don't have the ability to service any of those kinds...\n\nC: AAAAAAAAAGGGGGHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!\n(Yes, she literally screamed)\n\nPM: ....of calls. However, I know it's frustrating to wait, so what I can do is stay on the line with you until ____ picks up. That way, I can ensure you that you're not going to be hung-up on or anything. \n\n*Now, it's good to mention right here that this is usually against policy (warm-transferring to this department), but at this point, I don't give two shits.*\n\nC: Yeah, whatever, that's fine. But I want to let you know, I am so sick of how you guys have been treating me!\n\nPM: Well, I do know how you're feeling. However, this department is quite small so sometimes it can take a little bit of time to get through. \n\nC: What...the hell...do you mean? \n\nPM: One service they offer is that you can have them schedule a call back to you, that way you don't have to wait on the phone. \n\nC: I DON'T TRUST YOU CAPITALIST PIGS!\n\nPM: Oh, um, okay. Well, in that case, Let me put you on hold with them and I'll check back with you in a couple minutes if they don't pick up. \n\nCompany policy is to check up on them every couple of minutes if they're going to be on hold for an extended period of time. This is awful sometimes. I hated it so much. It was pretty awkward for the most part. This time, it bit me in the butt again. Every time I checked back with her, she would always come back with an insult about how I'm probably just a lazy-ass for not getting her through quicker. So finally, I kind of snapped: \n\nPM: Thanks again for holding m'am, I do appreciate you being patient with me (lol). I am still on hold with them, but I am going to stay on the line with you, per usual. \n\nC: This is ridiculous, PM, you don't know what I'm going through having to wait here with you. \n\nPM: M'am, I don't have any other customers I'm taking care of. I have to sit here on hold with them just like you do. It's not fun, I know.\n\nC: Excuse me? \n\nPM: I'm on hold with the department also.\n\nC: You...self-entitled...piece...of...fucking..shit. \n\nPM: Ex...excuse me? \n\nC: You worthless piece of shit! You're being salaried (bitch I'm being paid minimum wage) to sit on your ass and you're comparing your fucking experience with mine? \n\nPM: First off, m'am, I have to ask you to please mind your language or I will have to disconn....\n\nC: FUCK YOU! DO YOU KNOW WHERE I'M FROM. I'M FROM CHICAGO! CHI-CA-GO! YOU DUNNO NOTHIN' ABOUT MY LIFE AND WHERE I'M FROM. YOU'RE PROBABLY JUST SOME PRIVELIDGED WHITE BOY SITTING ON YOUR DADDY'S DICK LIVING THE GOOD LIFE WORKING FOR _____. \n\nPM: ....\n\nAt this point, I should've just hung up, but I was kind of curious about how far I could take this.\n\nC: YEAH THAT'S RIGHT, YOU DON'T KNOW NOTHING. I KNOW YOU'RE HOLDING ME FROM TALKING TO _____. IS IT BECAUSE I'M BLACK? (wait what? I didn't even realize she was black) YOU FUCKING WHITE PEOPLE...\n\nPM: M'am. I'm going to disconnect this call. I hope you are able to calm down enough to get this problem resolved. \n\nC: EXCUSE ME YOU LITTLE FAGGO...\n*click*\n\nI find that last line a bit funny because, yeah, my voice is a bit higher-pitched for a guy sometimes, but oh my god, even my worst customers NEVER even thought of using that word with me. \n\nBut yeah, I decided at that point that I can't handle a call-center job. I had been working there for a month and that pushed me over the edge. I didn't come in a day after that. ",

Got a ton of stories to share but I'll try and space them out, here's a recent gem...\n\n\n Me: Thank you for calling (Company name), how may I assist you today?\n\nClient: Yeah hi, I need to set up transportation to a dentist appointment.\n\nMe: Alright! I'd be more than happy to help you with that. (Cue verification and HIPAA stuff)\n\nMe: Ok Mr. Client! What is the physical address of the dentist you're going to see?\n\nClient: You already have that information, I don't have to tell you...\n\nMe: Actually sir I do not, and for liability I will have to confirm an address before arranging transportation. I will need that address please.\n\nClient: (screamed as loud as possible) No you fucking don't!\n\nMe: I'm sorry sir, please do not use profanity. I'm trying to help you.\n\nClient: (again, screamed at full volume) Fuck you! You fucking piece of shit! That's it! You just lost your job! Today! I want to speak to your supervisor! You are going to be fired right now!\n\nMe: Alright sir, I will get you a supervisor, please calm down. Bear with me one moment.\n\nClient: (screaming again) No! I will not calm down! You fucking think you can treat me like this? I'll find out where you are! You're fucking dead! I'm going to sue the shit out of you.\n\nMe: (mute the line and get a fellow floor walker, I explain the issue and she takes the call.) \n\nFW: Hi there! I understand you're having an issue scheduling your transportation today. (She's listening to him and I hear him getting louder and louder on the earpiece) Sir...please do not use profanity with me.(Screams coming through the headset now). Releasing the call due to belligerence. Have a nice day.\n\n\nSo afterwards we pull the call recording and send it to his insurance company. He got a lovely strike on his account for threatening C/S. Two more and he'll lose Medicare benefits. Moral of the story? Don't be a dick to the person helping you get free cab rides...asshole.",

        "text": "First post here and I wanted to try and recount a call I just had. For background info, I'm an order support agent for a major mobile device company and our exchange process is fairly easy to understand. You pay for the exchange phone to get it sent to you and then receive a refund of your original device when that phone comes back to us. Some people have trouble grasping this or are just uncomfortable with paying \"for something they already paid for!\" but this is how it works and I can't do anything about it. Additionally the iPhone 6 is less expensive than the iPhone 6 Plus, obviously, by about $100. Here's the conversation I had with EK (entitled kid).\n\nMe: Thank you for calling $CellPhoneCompany, my name is Kinetic, how can I help you?\n\nEK: Yeah, hi. I wanted to talk to someone about the problems on my order?\n\n*cue verification and general questions*\n\nEK: I got a 6 Plus when I ordered a 6 so you guys charged me more.\n\nMe: Oh, well I'm sorry about that, I can definitely set up and exchange for you to get out the right phone.\n\nEK: And wait another 3 or 4 days? Can't you just credit the difference?\n\nMe: Well you can return the phone and-\n\nEK: No, I want to keep it, but I want the difference credited because they lied to me.\n\nMe: Okay, well I'm sorry that there was some misinformation, but if you're keeping the phone then you need to pay for the phone.\n\nHe wasn't happy about it and hung up with his tail between his legs when I wouldn't just *give* him $100. Aw.\n\nShort but I was thinking of you guys during the whole call, so thanks for reading.",

        "text": "Working for customer service for a Canadian cellphone carrier DerpWireless, I took my first call as supervisor last night. I wasn't technically authorized, but since there was no actual supervisor on the floor, and I was doing floor support for the whole floor anyway, so I took it.\n\nThe agent dealing with the customer was a really mild older guy, and seldom asked for supervisor. This time, he told me that the customer absolutely couldn't be reasoned with and if I could do him a favor and take the call.\n\nSo apparently Mr. Crazy opened a new account back in May and went on holiday almost immediately afterwards. His son was supposed to take care of the bills but claimed that he'd never received the bills in the mail so there had been no payment made, so the account was canceled due to non-payment. A few days ago Mr. Crazy went and paid off the $180 past due. The current balance was ~$50. Now Mr. Crazy absolutely refused to pay the remaining balance and wanted the $180 back. \n\nOh, and he also wanted the service restored immediately so that he could transfer the account to his sister. How he worked out we could do both for him is beyond me.\n\nI looked at the clock. My shift was about to end in 10 minutes. So I better make this quick.\n\n\n\nParaphrasing here since I can't really repeat crazy rambles verbatim.\n\nMe: This is K0M, supervisor of DerpWireless customer service. How may I assist you today?\n\nCrazy: Give me your employee ID.\n\nWat.\n\nMe: Unfortunately Mr. Crazy, as per company policy, I won't be able to give you this information. How may I assist you today?\n\nCrazy: You can't?! Anyway I want my money back! I didn't even receive my bills and my son was taking care of everything and he didn't receive the bills either!\n\nMe: I do apologize for the inconvenience Mr. Crazy. However I see in our records here that our credit operations department has been calling you or your son since July. Did you guys not get any of the calls?\n\nCrazy: Oh no we don't answer those 1-800 calls! Who knows where they're calling from!\n\nMe: So you've never picked up the phone. Okay. But it seems they've also left you several voicemails.\n\nCrazy: No we don't check our voicemails either!\n\nMe: So Mr. Crazy, you're saying that you've never received the bills, or the phone calls, or the voicemails. Is that correct?\n\nCrazy: That's right!\n\nMe: But were you aware that you have a service active with DerpWireless?\n\nCrazy: Yes.\n\nMe: So how come you didn't pay the bills?\n\nMr. Crazy went off with the whole loop of madness again and kept repeating he wanted his money back and that he shouldn't have had to pay for a cancelled service, yadda yadda yadda. Eventually he got tired of screaming and passed the phone to his sister.\n\nSister: Bonjour, c'est (Sister) ici. Comment-allez vous? (Hi, this is Sister. How are you doing?)\n\nMe: Ça va très bien, merci. Mais madame, parlez-vous anglais? (I'm doing well, thank you. But ma'am, do you speak English?)\n\nSister: Oui, bien-sûr. (Yes, of course.)\n\nMe: Ma'am, this is English customer service. You don't need to speak French with me.\n\nSister: Oh I was just trying to be nice.\n\nI don't understand the logic (my French wasn't even really good to begin with), but okay, I digressed.\n\nMe: I appreciate that. Now, your brother's service has been cancelled due to non-payment, and the remaining balance needs to be cleared regardless. Especially since he'd like to transfer the service to you, we'll need to go through credit operations to restore the service before we can complete the transfer. \n\nSomehow Mr. Crazy got his hands on the phone again...\n\nCrazy: Well then what department are you?! Customer service or credit operations?!\n\nMe: This is the supervisor of CUSTOMER SERVICE whom you've asked to speak with.\n\nCrazy: Well then transfer me to credit operations now! I don't want to deal with you people I -\n\nHold. Cold transfer. Done.\n\nLog out time: 2 minutes after when my shift was supposed to end.\n\n",

        "text": "Background: I work in social housing in the UK.\n\nWe've had a repeat caller all week long, calling us to complain that his tap in his bath is not working properly.\n\nHe has called to make numerous complaints to us about this, about our operatives and our service.  By the time he’s called me (yesterday), he had already made numerous phone calls to complain to us. He was now saying that someone was meant to go to fix this issue and hadn’t turned up. I smelled something fishy, and opened our repair system to check the time. The system said he had an appointment for the afternoon, and he was adamant that he had told them to come out in the morning (which doesn’t matter if there’s no availability, you will get an afternoon appointment).\n\nI looked at the contact history and sure enough, he had called a colleague in the morning demanding someone attend immediately (not possible, not an emergency). I advised him of his appointment, and he said he would be “in and out” now. I advised if he missed the appointment it would have to be rearranged for a later date and he hung up on me. \n\nI called our controllers (who schedule appointments) and advised them he would be “in and out” and probably miss the appointment. A few hours later I called them back regarding a different repair, and the controller said \n\n&gt; “please tell me you’re not calling about [address] again, because they got carded.”\n\nOnce I got off the phone to her and sorted out the tenant on the line, I opened the repair system again and put in his address. Sure enough, they couldn’t get access to his property, and the operative had put in the notes that this was the 4th time he has been out and not got access.\n\nI called one of the controllers back, we’ll call her Brenda. Brenda laughed and advised me why it is he keeps complaining about his tap. It turns out there’s nothing wrong with it, he’s just not happy with how long his bath takes to fill up because he *likes to put his fish in there while he cleans out his fish tank*. \n\nI looked further into it, and it turns out he’s been carded SEVEN TIMES for this same job and then calls up to complain. Today, he called my colleague and requested a manager call back. I advised my manager of the situation, the 7 no access appointments, the fish, the constant calls. My manager has tried to call this guy 3 times now and every time he doesn’t pick up. The only reason my manager is calling is to advise him that every time he gets carded from now on he will have to pay a charge.\n\nI’ve heard a lot of crazy stuff in my time, but a tenant constantly complaining about his bath because he wants to put his fish in there is probably now top of my list. Especially one who keeps leaving his property during his appointment slot then calling to complain.\n",

        "text": "I made a post before about how I was just finishing training on yet another account.  I \"kind of\" met my new team leader for that account, before this we had never had a conversation at all.  Mind you: I've worked for this company for a few years now (and other call centers), and it's a really relaxed environment between staff and agents here.  We call each other by first names, we joke around, slang and stuff is used all the time...as long as we are not cursing or offensive, it's all good.\n\nIt was a really rough call.  Guy was screaming about how he should be reimbursed for \"frustration\" (ie: having to wait for a refund to clear his bank).  It was about 1 hr 45 minutes of every insult without a curse word, in the book...from my intelligence to everything else.  Yes, I can hang up on them if they get really completely outspoken.  But, I couldn't get him to go over the edge and OUTRIGHT insult me (a lot of subtle digs at me).  He was basically looking for a free-be, which is flagged on this account as a big nono and investigated.  The way he was going about the free-be sent up a lot of red flags, plus the way he was talking to me....\n\nAnyways, my new team leader got wind of it and I guess listened to some of it.  So, yay, my first interaction with new awesome team lead!  He asks me after the call if I'm okay.  This is the exact conversation (in typing) that occurred...\n\nTL:  You ok?\n\nMe:  Yeah, man. I'm good lol\n\nTL:  Don't call me man\n\nTL:  Call me Team Leader XYZNAME or Sir.\n\nMe:  Sorry.\n\n*Closes conversation and ignores for the rest of the shift*\n\nMind you, before now, everyone else has been super relaxed with talking to each other.  We had never had a conversation before this.  I had even sent out an email introducing myself, with no response from it or welcome (etc).  I had even personally sent him a message asking about OT opportunities, no response.  It has been drilled into our heads for years to be respectful and \"fun\".  Even my original trainer and the higher up prefer to be called by their first name, or nicknames (for fun and familiarity I guess?).  Obviously, I was mistaken all of these years.  I should have been more respectful, I guess, and not of used slang?  I'm not sure, I've said the same thing a thousand times with no issue.  (I'm actually a really laid back person)  I guess it was an insult to call him \"man\" (which is kind of like dude?).  I don't know.\n\nI looked into changing teams.  I cannot.  At all.  So, I am stuck with him and he with me.  I'm unsure now about how to go ahead while being on his team.  I mean, do I pretend that entire conversation didn't happen?  Do I just not talk to him?  Am I sickenly professional and nice all the time when I speak to him?  Gah, who knows.\n\nPS.  He's two years older than me.  I naturally don't even call my own father sir (where I am from, it is really disrespectful to demand someone to call you that) and my father is easily over 70 years (plus has EARNED my respect).  I think I might of put my foot in it this time....we definitely don't mesh well at all.\n\nUpdate:  Dickness confirmed today, called him Team Leader XYZ all day and acted like conversation never happened.  Had team meeting, was looking at a powerpoint presentation (screen too tiny for me to read unless full sized type of thing - so I was just listening to it instead of making it full screen, so I could also read the chat at the same time too).  I was called on to read said power point out, I was off by 1 line (1 sentence).  He called me out on it, made fun of me, and then expected me to go back and read the other line that I had missed (I just got really quiet and monotone, then sucked it up and read it - while people were making comments like \"oh she'll learn how we do things around here haahahaha\" and stuff like that)...all the while I was fighting not to get up and walk away from the job...  Others that have known me for a while were making comments to me privately like \"you just got thrown under the bus and that wasn't right at all\".  It was not enjoyable.\n\nThe chats are also gone.  They were deleted from the chat system.  The email I sent myself on my work email is also gone.  It's like it never happened...",

He was out about $300 from having a chargeback filed against him and not responding to it in time. He swears up and down that he submitted documents, he submitted them \"*three goddamn times*,\" and so on and so forth. There's already notes on the account about him calling in and being an asshat.\n\n**This guy's dialogue is cut down to be several times shorter and less wordy than it actually was.**\n\nMe: I'm sorry, we're well past the timeframe to submit documents and Visa's rules won't allow a reversal at this stage. You'll have to work out another form of payment with your client.\n\nCrazy guy: No, stop. That isn't what you say. This is the part where you say \"Mr. Crazy Guy, I'm going to do everything I can to get that money back for you.\" So what are you going to do?\n\nMe: I can't do anything else, the case is closed. These aren't our rules, these are Visa's rules, and they have the final say in this, but you can still collect from the client through different channels.\n\nCrazy guy: So you're telling me that because of YOUR mistake I have to spend MY money to collect on this guy???\n\n**[his not submitting documents is apparently our mistake; he thinks that we should have called him. No biggie, our team of 50 only handles thousands of these a month, we'll certainly single yours out and call you about it!]**\n\nMe: Unfortunately we needed to receive documents by [date] in order to send them to the bank. There were several deadlines on your notification letter and we always recommend calling in to make sure we received everything.\n\nCrazy guy: You should have called me and told me that!!!\n\nMe: I'm sorry, it's not feasible for us to call about every chargeback case we handle.\n\nCrazy guy: I'm a good customer! I spend a lot of money with you people! I should just take my business someplace else and tell everyone what assholes you are!\n\n**[He doesn't spend a lot of money with us. Surprise!]**\n\nMe: I personally believe you, but Visa needs it in writing by the deadline. There's nothing else I can do at this point.\n\nCrazy guy: Get me your supervisor!\n\n**[Inwardly rejoicing, I call escalations. The rep and I chat a little while she pulls up the account and I give her the short version of what's happened.]**\n\nEscalations: Oh, god, please tell me this isn't Crazy Guy.\n\nMe: Yep.\n\nEscalations: Yeah, we talked to him a couple of days ago. We can't do anything to help.\n\nMe: I told him that, apparently he's not letting go of it.\n\nEscalations: Yeah, he's nuts. He kept saying he was going to take out a gun and shoot himself if we couldn't give him his money.\n\nMe: Wow.\n\nEscalations: Yeah. So he's already heard what we're going to say, that we can't help at this point and he needs to get a different form of payment. Do you think you can get him off the phone?\n\nMe: Sure! I'll just keep telling him that.\n\nEscalations: Great! Let us know if it gets out of hand.\n\n**[I get back on the line with Crazy Guy and give him the news.]**\n\nMe: Sorry sir, I just got with Escalations and they've already told you what your options are at this point. This case is closed and there's nothing more we can do.\n\nCrazy guy: I said get your supervisor. Are they on the phone with us?\n\nMe: She's not, you already spoke with her the other day and she's giving us the same answer today. You'll need to work it out with the customer.\n\nCrazy guy: Not acceptable. Get your supervisor's supervisor.\n\nMe: Can't do that, I'm afraid.\n\nCrazy guy: GET HIM ON THE PHONE!\n\nMe: You've already spoken to escalations, and they have confirmed what I told you. You're past the timeframe--\n\nCrazy guy: WHEN I SAY I WANT A SUPERVISOR, I WANT A SUPERVISOR!\n\nMe: You've already spoken to her.\n\n**[This goes on for like 5 minutes, Crazy Guy ranting away and me cheerfully telling him the same thing over and over again.]**\n\nMe: We don't have any new information for you. If you want to receive funds for this sale, you'll need to work it out with the client.\n\nCrazy guy: DO YOU WANT TO FUCK WITH ME?\n\nMe: I... what?\n\nCrazy guy: DO YOU WANT ME TO SHOW UP WHERE YOU ARE? DO YOU WANT THAT?\n\nMe: Uuuhhh...\n\n**[Hindsight has gifted me with several, much better things I could have said, such as \"Are you aware this line is recorded?\" and \"Are you threatening me?\"]**\n\nCrazy guy: [one final, wordless snarl of rage before he disconnects]\n\nMe: ...damn.\n\nSo I sent off an email to the floor like \"Be aware that Crazy Guy from #### might call in about chargebacks. We can't help him. He's already talked to Escalations and threatened me. Ping me if you need help.\"\n\nAnd that's the last time I heard from him. After work I got online and Facebook stalked him and his business. His business blog was full of posts like \"What the Government isn't telling you about fluoridated water!!!!1\" and he had genuine crazy-person eyes.",

        "text": "Background: I work in social housing in the UK, so the people I deal with on a regular basis are quite...interesting (read: batshit crazy). \n\nToday I got a call that wasn't even one of our tenants, but a friend of theirs. She was quite riled up by the time the phone rang and put her through to me (we have auto answer) and began shouting almost immediately.\n\nThe gist of the conversation is that her friend's father had passed away some time ago, but she was still receiving letters with his name on. I had a look on the account and sure enough, his name was still on the tenancy, meaning they haven't reported this to their housing office.\n\nI tried to ask the lady on the phone if they had contacted the housing at all to report this and she immediately **lost her shit** at me. (TF = tenant's friend, ME = me)\n\n&gt; TF: \"SHE DOESN'T HAVE TO DO ANYTHING! THIS IS DISGUSTING! I'M GOING TO THE NEWSPAPER! \n\n&gt; ME: *tries to get a word in* \"Okay but -\"\n\n&gt; TF: \"NO! IT'S DISGUSTING! WHY IS SHE RECEIVING THEM?! SHE SHOULDN'T BE!\"\n\n&gt; Me : \"I'm trying to - \"\n\n&gt; TF: \"I'M GOING TO THE PAPERS YOU'RE ALL DISGUSTING! SHE SHOULDN'T DO ANYTHING THIS SHOULDN'T BE HAPPENING\" blah blah blah.\n\nNow, at this point I'd like to explain that I do completely understand why she is upset. If this were happening to me, I'd be mortified myself, especially if I were still grieving. But all I'm trying to do is tell this woman that she needs to take a copy of the death certificate to the housing office and this problem will be solved. She won't even let me get a word in and is at this point SCREAMING at me over the phone and to be honest I've stopped listening.\n\n&gt; ME: \"Ma'am, I can't help you if you're going to scream over me, if you continue to do this I will have to terminate the call\"\n\n&gt; TF: *continues screaming at me*\n\n&gt; ME: \"Okay, I'm going to terminate the call now.\" *hangs up*.\n\nShe called back to one of my colleagues and he sent  message to the housing officer for her, but it completely ruined the rest of my day and put me in a foul mood. A few hours later, my manager shouted me over and said that an email had come through with an apology for me. It wasn't much, it literally said:\n\n&gt; \"(friend) was phoning on (tenant) behalf, but was caught off guard, and wishes to apologise for the way she spoke to the advisor. Please could you pass this on to them\"\n\nLike I said, it's not a lot. But considering the bullshit I deal with for 40 hours a week, every week (tenants threatening to sue because we won't change lightbulbs/toilet seats, \"why won't you give me a house and prioritise me over the other 30,000 people on the waiting list?!\" etc) it made my day a little better.\n\n\nEDITED FOR BONUS STORY:\n\nOne of our tenants had a new gas meter fitted (prepaid meter) and so we had capped (cut off) his gas for safety. He had an appointment for today to get it turned back on and got carded, meaning they couldn't get access to carry out the work. He called me at 3.30pm and the operatives finish at 4pm. I called our controllers who do the scheduling and they said there is no way anyone is going back out today, and \"good luck rescheduling\".\n\nI look at the diary and sure enough, the earliest slot is Wednesday morning. I try to tell the tenant this and he goes ape shit, shouting that we're all liars and no one came out and he'd get his own operative to do the work. I advised he is in his rights to do this, but will be criminally liable if anything blows up afterwards. I offered him the next appointment but he refused. He has so far called back 5 times now and been hung up on 5 times for being abusive to staff and refusing appointments he is offered, even when people higher up than myself have tried to bring the appointment forward for him, as he is adamant he wants someone out today. \n\nHave fun having no gas!",

Especially new ones.\n\nWe just got a new one recently, and while the idea of it is great, the actual practice of it thus far has been *awful*.\n\nWhen they first hired us we asked them what *our* main objective was as their call center, and they told us they wanted tech support since it's an app-based program. We said, okay, let's get some scripting. Literally they sent us 20 different questions with the same exact answer: Take all of their info (name, number, email, location, etc) and tell them to restart the app. If that doesn't work, email their info and the staff will follow up. This seemed kinda silly, but we didn't anticipate high call volume, so we let it go.\n\nFor a while, everything seemed fine, but over the last few months some crazy stuff has happened. We've gotten calls about the app not working correctly, people getting charged *huge* fees (over $300), and other crazy stuff I'd rather not go into. *Literally* all we can do is try to connect the caller with someone from the company, and if we can't (99% of the time we can't) we have to send a message.\n\nToday I got over 5 calls from *different banks* calling on behalf of people who have yet to hear from the owner about their refunds. These people are getting overdraft fees like *crazy* and the owner refuses to do anything about it.\n\nOh, and while we're on the subject of the owner, he's a **complete asshole** to our boss. There were days on end where he'd call in **screaming** at my boss about *us* supposedly fucking up while in reality it's his shitty business practices.\n\nNow, I did some research about this guy, and he has videos of himself praising where he went to school and did his learning about business. He's a completely self-absorbed asshole. I found pictures on top of pictures of this guy at events where he has these girls in bikinis surrounding him like he's some sort of business *god* or something. He made one of my favorite coworkers quit because he yelled at her on the phone. He's completely short-tempered, self-centered, misogynistic, and all around rude. I will *celebrate* the day he stops using our service (and hopefully goes out of business).\n\n**TL;DR** crazy asshole \"businessman\" thinks he's better than everyone else even though he owes people a buttload of money. Curse at me one more time buddy I'll ream you a new asshole.",

        "text": "Hello fellow TFCC folks, I have a tale to share, happened last week.\n\nSo, I do all your banking via phone, that is credit cards, personal accounts and so forth, good gig from students in Finance/Business streams or even without, plenty of opportunities to move up the bank, as long as your metrics are decent at least.\n\nToday I tell you about this entitled customer known as C.\n\n&lt;after the usual greeting and verification&gt;\n\nC: I was with another bank before, and even though I had a premium credit card, they waived its annual fee every year.\n\nMe: I see, did you maintain other specific products with them which gave you a rebate for your credit card?\n\nC: No, they just liked me as I spent 100,000$ or so on their credit card, therefore, they got happy and waived it. \n\n[This right there is BS, every bank has a few premium products that if you maintain those, you get your premium credit card for free, other than that, no one ever waives any fees, the 'just because they are happy' - no matter how much you spend]\n\nMe: Well, I see you spend upward of $100,000 on this card, which means you get so much more rewards (this is a high rewards credit card, the fee is around ~ $100) so even if you pay the fee, you still get so much more, you are getting ten times more of a return (he is really getting ~$1500+ out of it) just by paying this AND you get insurance on many things as well.\n\nC: *starts screaming* - No, you will waive the fee and give me everything free right damn now, I am a high paying customer, do it now or I cancel.\n\nMe: Ok, let me see what I can do, I'll put you on hold.\n\n[When people start screaming, no point of challenging them, my mind is already made up, I'll put 'em on a 10-minute hold, and go on Reddit or starting chatting with a co-worker, a nice lil break]\n\nMe: I looked into everything, I won't be able to do much I am afraid, but as I see the rewards worth over 1.5k aren't much but its the annual fee is the problem right?\n\nC: Yes! Waive it now, or I cancel!\n\nMe: Sure thing, I'll transfer this card to a very basic no annual fee card, so you don't get any rewards, no fee as well, want this? [lol]\n\nC: No, never, I *want* the rewards, just waive it or I cancel every single thing, I'll take my high spending elsewhere. (In a very smug tone) \n\nMe: Ok sure, I'll just read a few things to close this.\n\nC: ... ... ... I see, is there anyone else I can talk to? (very shocked)\n\nMe: Hm, Sure thing, wait a sec:\n\n&lt;Transfer to a retention tier 2 specialist&gt;\n\nMe: Hey man, explains the story and emphasized to cancel.\n\nTier2: Sure thing, send 'em over.\n\nNow here is where I end, but after two hours I check the call history, he called us 4 more times, and everyone who conversed did the same thing based on notes, did not give into his bluffs, and agreed to cancel everything right away.\n\nAfter the 4th call, he finally cancelled, so much for his rewards.\n\nAt times if you are very nice as a one time exception, we give you a half off, but the fact that me and four other people did the same thing explains what he really deserved it. \n\nLesson to be learnt: He gets $1500+ out of this card only because he spends $100k yearly, some people spend a million$, so its not that if he is the next big thing. \n\nIt is just he thinks he is somehow entitled, and every bank (or service) should bow down and waive everything for him.\n\nAs a result, he lost 2 hours of his time frustrated, got very shocked when no one gave to his bluffs 5 separate times, as if we are to come down begging for him, lost 5 years worth of account history, and all the rewards he was getting, all because we didn't beg him.\n\nHave fun applying for a giant credit limit through another bank then via a hard enquiry on your credit score, more time waste, just cause of that damn fee.",
