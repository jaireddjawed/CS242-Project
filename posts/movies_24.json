I don't really know.\n\n[https://wabcradio.com/2023/03/08/cinema-in-60-seconds-oscar-nominations/](https://wabcradio.com/2023/03/08/cinema-in-60-seconds-oscar-nominations/)\n\nWhile EEAAO was an amazing story, Banshees of Inisherin made me bawl like a baby. The characters, plot, and simple struggles were something that just hits the feels. I feel likle EEAAO has a store in therer somewhere that could've been amazing, but was buried under too much comedy and goofiness.\n\n Anyone else agree? TLDR: Banshees is a better film IMO.",

        "text": "Hello, over the past couple of years my love for movies has grown exponentially. Through high school and college i purely watched movies for a couple hours of entertainment. Now, it is a completely different story. I have seen I would say ma good amount of the ‚Äúmain stream‚Äù films that have come out since the 80s, (googling ‚Äútop movies since the 80s‚Äù and scrolling through various articles haha) and I‚Äôd like to branch out to films that are considered more ‚Äòart‚Äô rather than entertainment. \n\nI‚Äôve recently watched Tokyo Story (Ozu), followed by Taxi Driver (Scorsese) and loved both stories. I am from Michigan so seeing Japanese cultures, traditions and differences between generations captured my attention like a film hasn‚Äôt in a while. As for Taxi Driver, probably my favorite Scorsese film that I didn‚Äôt know existed until yesterday. \n\nWith that being said, I know there are some great films that flew completely under my radar throughout recent years, and some from before I was even born (‚Äò98) and was wondering if anyone had any recommendations? Or would even like to PM me and talk about films a little more in depth? No one I know appreciates films the way I do. Setting to me is one of the most important parts of a film. Ergo why I liked Tokyo Story and Taxi Driver so much. Great depiction of Japanese city traditions and customs, and loud noisy chaotic New York. \n\nA couple more of my favorites, in no particular order would be..\n\nInterstellar \n\nFargo \n\nSchindler‚Äôs List\n\nDjango Unchained\n\nPrisoners\n\nBack to the future\n\nInglorious Basterds\n\nGood Time\n\nTenet\n\nAs I wrote out this list it‚Äôs definitely a wild mix but it is what it is üòÖ I don‚Äôt necessarily consider myself a movie buff or anything but I‚Äôm more than likely headed that direction. Any recommendations are welcomed and appreciated!! Thank you!",

        "text": "I used to work as a media editor for a marketing company a few years back and as a result I have picked up an annoying habit of paying closer attention to the editing style of movies I go and see. Now that I got my pretentious backstory out of the way, allow me to explain what I feel a lot of movies are doing now in the editing room.\n\nThere's a new editing trend where movies are cutting narratives to fit into social media viewing habits (which is now 6 seconds, oy vey). I think this movie tried to edit together too many quick moments at once and it felt messy. At times it felt like an SNL skit and others it felt way too overly dramatic. But like, isolate those moments on social media and you might get some attention. In Cocaine Bear, there are so many individual scenes in this movie that are great or funny but when you line them up next to each other in a 90 minute movie the pacing and tone just don't make any logical sense, but they are made perfect for a short clip on tiktok or Instagram reels or a ad to play before your YouTube video. There were characters introduced with a large dedication to screen time, to just die shortly after. |The EMT characters for example, they spent a good amount of time building up their characters only to die very quickly and their almost entire scene was used in \nthe trailers|\n\nI might be totally over analyzing this, but not sure if anyone else has started to pick up on trends like this.",

Watching him collapse under it was emotionally devastating yet so powerful.\n\nYou knew he wasn't going to get help. The tragic ending was always coming, like a train wreck you couldn't look away from. I cried so hard and yelled at the screen when he wouldn't go to the hospital.
