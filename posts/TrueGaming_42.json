        "text": "It's no secret; the 2006-2016 timeframe wasn't the brightest for Zelda. Four contentious titles in the Wii/DS era (Twilight Princess, Phantom Hourglass, Skyward Sword, and Spirit Tracks), followed by a lull through the Wii U era with a mixed bag on the 3DS (decent return to form for A Link Between Worlds, TriForce Heroes being Four Swords without any ingenuity or charm). Sure, there are people who really like this era, really dislike this era, or have an average opinion of this era, but it is still a far cry from the universal acclaim the SNES-N64 games still get to this day.\n\nFor a long time, Dark Souls was called \"Zelda for adults\" or \"what Zelda should be\", all because it provided a balance of combat and exploration missing from Zelda. But I didn't get that; a LOT of Action-Adventure/Action RPGs tackled the exploration/combat mix in their own way. Just because Dark Souls had exploration and combat didn't mean it was following the Zelda formula.\n\nReally, it was Okami that executed the traditional Zelda formula, and executed it far better than the mediocrity of the TP-SS era. Soulsborne may have taken elements from it, but Okami went the extra mile to take the Zelda formula where it needed to go.\n\nWhen it came to world design Okami went for a more segmented, linear approach, consisting of connected several open fields in an overall linear setup. This is what Zelda went for from the N64 to the Wii era, but while Wii era Zelda felt bland, constrictive, and empty, Okami felt alive and packed with things to do. Okami's overworld was full of things to find like Stray Beads, clovers and trees to bloom, Sun Fragments to increase your health, and antiques with their own descriptions that you could sell for money. Souls takes a more similar approach to Metroid or the Metroid-Castlevania games where there's no distinction between overworld and dungeon, but Okami included this distinction important to Zelda, and did it marvelously.\n\nWhen it comes to puzzles and environmental interaction, Okami captured this aspect of Zelda better than all other games. Sure, DS2 had Shulva which did emphasize environmental puzzles to an extent, but it was hardly indicative of the whole series. Okami did everything to make Zelda-style environmental interaction as fun as possible. You could draw from fire, water, lightning, and ice and do things such as light torches, put out fire, use tapestries as platforms, and create platforms out of moist air. You could also use Power Slash multiple chests/pots at once and use Veil of Mist to slow spinning platforms or \"Blocking Spiders\". What's more, while Wii-era Zelda games couldn't be bothered to make items useful outside of their introduced dungeon nor a variety of uses for each item, you're constantly using each brush technique for progressively creative applications throughout the game. A good example would be the weighing scale puzzle in Wawku Shrine, where you need to use a combination of Bloom and Power Slash to get a group of bonsai to weigh a certain amount to unlock the next room. It certainly helped that Okami tried their damndest to make all of its abilities useful in combat, giving enemies various elemental weaknesses and using wind or mist to stun/slow enemies for example.\n\nWhile some may not like the traditional Zelda formula, I think Okami on its own proves that there is still life left in that formula even if BotW went out of its way to get away from it and its immediate predecessors were far from stellar. The Soulsborne may have done some things like Zelda did, but executed them with a much different focus and was missing several elements. Okami actually did everything that Zelda was trying to do at the time, and succeeded where the TP-SS era fell short.\n\nThat said, I wouldn't be opposed to a Soulsborne or Soulslike that focuses heavily on environmental interaction and puzzle solving. I'm pretty damn sure that From has it in them to have Alundra-level puzzles in a Soulslike game.",

        "title": "Innovation on failure and loss states: the case of Pyre",
        "author": "shisyastawuman",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/7xk65s/innovation_on_failure_and_loss_states_the_case_of/",
        "text": "Before I start my argument: even though I'll try to avoid them, I warn you that mild spoilers for Pyre will follow.\n\nLet me start by summarizing the example I want to talk about. The latest Supergiant game, Pyre, is a combination of visual novel and fantasy basketball. You lead a team of exiles in some kind of purgatory. To break free and go back to the real world, you have to win matches of a sport similar to basketball against AI teams. After a number of encounters, you play for the liberation of one of your teammates and so does the enemy team. Whoever wins gets to free one of their own. This cycle repeats, each time with fewer matches in between the important ones, until it stops and the game finishes.\n\nWhat's interesting about Pyre is that, despite having clear win and lose states for each match, **losing never stops you from playing the game**. I haven't tried it but I'm fairly sure you always play the same amount of encounters even if you win or lose all of them (or a combination of these outcomes). Since win and loss states are integral to games, new takes on them are always interesting to dissect. So what I'd like to discuss here is the effects of Pyre's twist on failure and loss states.\n\nWhen I found out this (by losing a match), I was happily surprised. I was sure the game would make me redo the encounter until I'd win it so this twist was unexpected and inmediately felt new to me, it sparked my curiosity for what would happen next. I don't want to make too much generalisations about \"dying\" in videogames. I wouldn't want to state that having to redo a portion of a game (a dungeon, a boss fight, etc.) or having to start over is plain wrong, because it's actually essential for whole genres of games (like plataformers and roguelikes). However, I think there's one universal truth about game design which applies in this case: **a game should never keep you from playing it**. One of the worst offenders are checkpoints that make you rewatch an unavoidable cutscene before retrying a fight, thus impeding you to keep playing for a couple of minutes. In this sense, Pyre's failure system feels great because it doesn't break the flow or immersion of the game, at all.\n\nFurthermore, **the world reacts to your defeat**, as I experienced right after it. Your teammates will encourage you to keep going, your opponents will tease you and trashtalk you and so on. This is also great because games usually act like you never failed and also breaks immersion. For example, maybe you passed a boss fight after the hundredth try, but the following cutscene shows you breezing through it, which ultimately feels fake. Some games let you retry without forgetting about your failures: the best example is the recap that Super Meat Boy plays for you when you pass a level, showing how all your previous attempts went wrong. This actually feels fantastic because it's a graphic depiction of how you got better. Pyre takes it in a different direction (and I will return to this difference in my following point): **it builds its world and its themes upon your failure**. Enemies are more personal, because these are the guys that beated you countless time and you really want to turn the tables on them. Defeat is also a main theme of the game: there are plenty of main characters weighed down by past failures or obsessed with victory, and there are also characters (and to me this is fairly uncommon) which embrace or desire defeat, either for personal reasons or as a sacrifice for others (remember that freedom is the reward). This is really interesting because it sparks moral dilemmas where you wouldn't expect them. Usually wining is a good thing, but in Pyre characters can get angry at you because you didn't listen when they asked you to not free them or to let the oponents win.\n\nYet Pyre's failure system has two big flaws. On one hand, by pushing you to move on, **the game somewhat impairs your ability to learn from your mistakes and get better**. Each enemy has its own abilities and strategies, so each time you're facing a new challenge which requires you to develop new skills. But the matches can be so fast that you don't really have enough time to adjust your gameplay and overcome your weaknesses. You lose and then the game throws you a different challenge to you, so you're back to square one. There's always progression, so the game is always getting harder and even though eventually the enemies start repeating, now they have better gear and skills. Of course, these are all good game design choices on their own, but when mixed with the inability to try and learn how many times you want, they end up having a negative effect. This is heightened by the fact that much of the game passes in the visual novel format, while the sport sections are few are far between, so it can feel pretty bad when you waited so much for a match and then you lose it in a spell. Note that there is a training area, but in my experience the AI there differs vastly from the real challenges you'll face.\n\nOn the other hand, while individual characters have complex reactions to losing a match, the overarching plot is far more binary (**heavy spoilers ahead**): each teammate you free will help you stir a revolution against the government back in the real world. If you liberate enough people, the revolution triumphs in a pacifist fashion; otherwise, it sparks a bloodshed or it outright fails. Since the character who comes up with this plan is a bit shady, I was hoping for a plot twist where the revolution was a farse to put him in power. Although this would've been predictable, **the actual plot creates a black and white outcome, which goes against the whole innovative take on failure as a theme integral to the story**.\n\nIn conclusion, Pyre uses narrative feedback as the main outcome of defeat, therefore enacting an emotional response in the player without breaking the flow of gameplay, instead of punishing him and making him feel frustrated. As a downside, this system allows fewer opportunities for the player to improve. Also, while the integration of defeat as a theme enrichens the world and the characters, the ending works against this.\n\nWhat do you think? Have you played the game? Did you like how it handled failure?\n\nSorry for any grammar mistakes, English is not my first language.",

Personally,  I discovered the game I was in my late twenties and personally have no association with that game and being a child. \n\nI similar phenomenom can be seen with adolscent kids obsession with first person shooters, a genre that arguably most were not allowed to play when they were \"little\", but now it proves, probably mostly to themselves, that they are no longer a child. \n\nDiscuss :)\n",

Examples are Elizabeth from 'Bioshock Infinite', dogs like Dogmeat (Fallout) or the dog from the 'Fable' -series, or Trico from 'The Last Guardian'.  \n  \nFor my thesis, I conduct a survey to find out how Social Companions are perceived, which qualities are judged positively or negatively, and whether/how you establish an emotional bound to them.  \nIt would be super helpful and I'd be grateful forever, if you had 15 minutes to spare to click through my survey. :) (In order to be able to answer the questions, you should have played at least one game in which you were accompanied by a companion.)  \n  \nThe survey is purely for scientific purposes, i.e. it is not related to any businesses, is completely anonymous and takes maximally 15 minutes. If you have played BioShock Infinite, The Last Of Us, Fallout 3, Fallout 4, Fable 2, Fable 3, or The Elder Scrolls: Skyrim (with Meeko as a companion), you have the option to answer additional questions about these games (this takes about 3 additional minutes).  \n  \nHere's the [questionnaire](http://survey.ecg.uni-due.de/index.php/115792?lang=en).  \n  \nIf you have any question, feel free to pm me!  \n  \nThanks a lot!",

        "text": "The recent release of Kingdom Come: Deliverance has reinvigorated my interest in this subject and made me question why video games aren't used to seriously explore history more often.  \n\nAssassin's Creed is the only AAA title I can think of that attempts to tackle history in this way.  Unfortunately it is wrapped in a sci-fi story and various narrative trappings that take away from any real historical accuracy.  \n\nTo my knowledge, KC:D is the only action/rpg game with this level of fidelity that attempts to accurately portray an era of history.  I do think video games as a medium should tap into this \"genre\" more often.  Not only can games serve as an educational tool, but I believe they can engage and inspire us to take interest in our past more than film or literature.\n\nI would love for more games to explore eras/locations/events in history with the authenticity and respect that KC:D does.\n\nThe only other game on the horizon that is doing this is Titanic: Honor and Glory.  It is still a LONG ways off but if you are interested in this sort of thing I highly recommend you check it out.\n\nWhat eras/places/events in history do you guys want to explore?  Do you think games can be used as a learning tool for history?  Does VR fit into any of this?",

Spybotics: the Nightfall Incident was a stylized, turn-based strategy game on Lego.com where you would \"hack\" into other computers. You took turns moving the pieces you chose at the beginning of the level and deploying their unique attacks or abilities until you had eliminated all the enemy pieces on the board or reached the objective. Plus, with all the different programs you could buy and deploy, you never felt forced to go with a specific strategy or approach. It's one of the most enjoyable games I've ever played, and I've never found anything I consider similar.\n\nThe reason this is tricky for me, personally, is I would say that I strongly dislike turn-based games and / or strategy games. I guess they either look too \"simulator-y\" or resource managing like the Civ games, or when you get far enough in Spore. Or I see games like X-Com and Shadow run, where I feel like the graphics take away from it, and I just wish I was playing an action shooter. \n\nSo here are my questions for you guys: What do you guys think make this game what it is? And do we have any games today like it? I feel like I would really enjoy having a turn-based strategy game to relax and play, as opposed to all the fast paced games in my library. But everything I've seen looks unappealing to me. Maybe I need to find something more minimalist? What do you guys think?",

I have to admit that the concept is intriguing, to say the least. A medieval simulator, I can dig that.  On paper it seems like everything I would like, open-world, free form exploration, the ability to go-your-own-way and make you own path. But there are things that bug me.\n\nOne of the things that bug me is the \nPrespective. IMO it would be better if it was 3rd person. If was, I'd buy it in a heartbeat. Honestly, I don't have anything against first person games, I've played my share of FPS's and loved Dying Light, but Kingdom Come seems it like it will be much harder to play from a first person perspective. To me it seems like it would be harder taking on a gang of bandits. I think that's one of the reasons that a games like Uncharted or even The Witcher is 3rd person, it gives you kind a situational awareness. I get that the game is going for realism, but does that it's sacrificing fun for realism.\n\nAnother question is: How free form is it? Is it like The Long Dark where it completely open and you can do you own thing or are you always tied to the story? What about the end game, am I then free do do whatever I wish or does it end? Personally I would prefer to carve my own path, that's the fun of Skyrim, I mostly ignore the story and do things my own way. But am I asking too much from this?",

        "text": "From my perspective, Xenogears gets treated like the ugly stepchild of the 16-32bit era jRPGs. It's vastly overshadowed by the Final Fantasy series in the west, and since Squaresoft never let go of the IP, the Xenosaga series could only be a successor in spirit. It still was critically praised in its day and doesn't deserve to be forgotten.\n\nFor those that don't know the game, a few cornerstones that set it apart:\n\n* Mixed sprite/3d graphics. All characters are animated 2d sprites with 8 orientations that are drawn into a freely rotatable 3d world which gives the game a pretty unique look in a time when other games used prerendered backgrounds and fixed camera angles.\n\n* One of the core gameplay elements are mechs called gears. Characters in mechs have massively inflated stats and can easily take out groups of foot soldiers. Unexpectedly though the game doesn't only pit mechs against mechs and plain troups against enemies, there will be times when you are allowed to mow down stuff in a mech, and also times where you are in danger of fighting enemy mechs on foot. Also the gears have limited fuel so all fights inside them are a constant battle against time until your fuel runs out.\n\n* Overambitious everything. A story that goes from war to mech power fantasy to religious zealotry to a creation myth to space travel with a deep dive into Jungian and Freudian psychology along the way. Unfortunately all of that had to be developed in a two year span and so the second half of the game is made in a radically different style so that the team could complete the game on time and still tell the whole story. Still, even disc one is larger and longer than many of its contemporary games.\n\nPeople who did not play it on the PSX will have a hard time stumbling upon it though, because unlike the Final Fantasy series it has not been graced with remakes on newer consoles.",

        "title": "Two Major Types of Boss Fight Design",
        "author": "mithrillion",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/7x14ji/two_major_types_of_boss_fight_design/",
        "text": "Boss fights are supposed to be some of the most challenging portions of a game, and in order to do so, different games adopted different strategies. I have found that most boss fights are made according to one of two design philosophies, sometimes with different degrees of blending but usually leaning towards one side.\n\nType 1. Key words: Reactive / Generalisable Skills / Reflex / Situational Awareness\n\nThis is the type of fights where you have to draw upon your knowledge of fighting previous enemies and your character's combat skills in general, and react to the boss's moves appropriately, but do not usually require you to memorise the boss's whole moveset, phase order etc. You need to be good at playing your character, but not necessarily good at fighting this boss. A good example of this are fights in Witcher series. You defeat your enemies by being a good witcher, which means use your light attack to wear down your enemies, use your heavy to break defense, dodge/roll when being attacked and parry/counter whenever convenient. Most enemies, even bosses have similar cues as to when they are going to attack and whether it is going to be a blockable attack, and some common monster knowledge can help you identify weaknesses of enemies in general. Your skills are usually widely applicable to most situations, e.g. Quen can be used to block some of the seemingly unstoppable boss moves, and many bosses can be set on fire. Fights can become very unforgiving, but being a good player with decent sitiuational awareness can help you bring down difficult, unfamiliar bosses even on your first try. On the other hand, it does make some fights feel repetitive/samey, as you are not required to do unique things for each boss (although the fight preparation part sort of remedies that in the Witcher games)\n\nType 2. Key words: Predictive / Fight-specific mechanics / Memorisation / Rhythm\n\nThis is the type of fights where you often simply cannot win no matter what on your first try. You must observe, figure out and deal with the mechanics of each specific boss. Knowing what types of moves a boss has is crucial, so is the order in which they come or the condition to trigger each move. Bosses can have multiple phases requiring drastically different strategies to throw you off guard, and you must be aware of that and prepare for it. This is your typical WoW boss and is widely used in many MMOs (e.g. FFXIV uses this extensively, especially in the \"Primal\" fights. However, in other MMOs like ESO, Type 1 is used more often). It can also be found in many JRPGs. The biggest difference between this and Type 1 fights is that it is less about what you know about your character and more about what you know about the boss. You have to be able to predict what is to come, and reflex alone typically will not carry you very far. Bosses can be more predictable / scripted than Type 1, but also usually more unforgiving in that there will be mechanics where there exists only one solution. For example, your character might have skills like Quen, but it either will not block that team-wiping spell or is on an extremely long cooldown; instead, you have to break a specific column to interrupt the casting. Many players call this type of boss fights \"choreography\".\n\nPersonally I think a well-done Type 1 (reactive) boss fight can potentially give you the best experience, as it is closest to how a real in-game character would defeat their enemies - drawing inspirations from their generic skills and previous experiences. However, many skilled players, especially MMO players and \"git gud\" game (Dark Souls etc.) players consider Type 1 to be \"shallower\", and I agree that learning and solving mechanics can sometimes be quite fun. What is your preferred type of boss fight (including mixtures) and maybe a few good examples of it?",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/7wx5jt/will_the_lord_of_the_rings_living_card_game/",
        "text": "Hello all, I'm a big fan of digital collectible card games (CCGs), but I'm not a huge fan of PvP. Since most digital CCGs are centered around PvP, I am very intrigued by the upcoming Lord of the Rings Living Card Game coming to Steam, which is based on a tabletop collectible card game with a similar name. \n\nA distinguishing feature of this game, it seems, is that it will be focused on relatively short PvE missions. The player plays against Sauron, an AI that has its own deck of cards customized for each mission. The player can carefully construct his or her deck specifically for the mission in order to overcome the specific challenges it presents.\n\nNow here is my question for you: does this type of game have the potential of thriving, and if so, does it have the potential to popularize a new genre of digital CCGs?\n\nNow, current digital CCGs usually do have a PvE mode, but it is rarely the game's focus, content is often limited, and deck-building, surprisingly, is not always a central feature. For an example of the last point, Magic Duels has quite a few story-mode campaigns, but the player must defeat the various scenarios using pre-constructed decks. Now, some games, such as Hearthstone, do have PvE modes in which the player is invited to construct his or her own deck. But there are only so many missions, and the only way to acquire the cards needed to beat some of the challenges is to play the PvP side of the game, or to buy booster packs for real money (the price tag, in which case, is far too great if one's primary interest is the PvE missions). \n\nBy contrast, the structure of the Lord of the Rings Living Cards Game seems to open the door for a distinctive experience: 1) The game will be focused on PvE, 2) players can grow their card collections through PvE, and 3) deck construction, aimed at overcoming specific challenges, will be a central feature. Consider this last point for a moment. Instead of trying to construct a generalist deck that can defeat a variety of PvP opponents, as is typical for digital CCGs, the player is invited to construct a deck specifically for the mission at hand. With a sufficiently great diversity of missions, this could provide a unique experience among digital CCGs. The player will be actively encouraged to constantly try out new, interesting strategies in order to beat different missions, rather than to perfect a single, ladder-climbing generalist deck. The developers can enhance this effect by utilizing daily quests to present more specific challenges - for example, \"Beat Quest X with Aragorn\" or \"Beat Quest Y with 2 Lore heroes.\"\n\nOf course, another distinctive feature of the game is the \"Living Card Game\" distribution model. Rather than rely on randomized booster packs for growing your collection, which can be frustrating, the developers promise to create a system that allows players to acquire specifically the cards that they want, through booster packs with set cards, and through a \"valor\" system which allows players to purchase specific cards (these features are all still under development, though, and a more randomized card acquisition system is available for those who wish to use it, called the \"Palantir\").\n\nWhat do you all think? Could such a gameplay model thrive? Will PvE-centric, deck-building puzzle scenarios engage players? And if so, could this game popularize a new genre of digital CCGs that mimic this style? I look forward to hearing your thoughts!\n\nFor more information, see the [Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/app/509580/The_Lord_of_the_Rings_Living_Card_Game/) page or the [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/ffigames/videos/all?no-mobile-redirect=true) channel, which has some alpha gameplay footage.",

        "text": "Hi all,\n\nI was playing Assassins Creed Origins lately.   \nIt is not bad :  \n- It is a pretty game  \n- with interesting setting  \n- original NPC faces, they are good looking people but not perfect looking, i gotta give to ubisoft for creating \"realistic\" heroes.  \n- and the game acts as a good way to brush up history and such  \n\n(but very boring repetitive gameplay, as usual with ubisofts and open world games in general).\n\nI. \n\nOne thing that came up to me why playing and that was kind of a ridiculous feeling : **My character is a mad man running around all the time**.\n\nEveryone is walking, minding his own business, like a calm person, and I am running around insanely. From icon to icon, from map marker to map marker, from NPCs to NPCs.... it makes no sense. And I remember feeling the same way while playing Witcher 3 and Zelda BTOW.   \n\nThe game world ceases to be a game world is a more like a Theme Park and you are the only \"intelligent\" person running from machines to machines. Everything becomes so fake because everything is waiting for you to make it happen and you are running towards it.\n\nI understand that if you were walking it would take too much time to do stuff. But why ? ... because...the \"Points of Interests\" (NPC, quests marker)... are....too.... far from each other? So the potential walking is not the problem, it is the layout of the quests markers?\n\n**So, question, is it possible to have the player character act like he belongs to the wold ?** because right now, in open world game you dont belong, you run around, your actions have few consequences, and NPCs are just a backfrop.\n\nII. \n\nAslo, about the Fast Travel.\n\nIt is often discussed and criticized. But let see why is there fast travel. In Assassins Creed Origins I saw that MANY quests makes you actually go back and forth from A to B and back to A. Of course, without Fast Travel it would be cumbersome.\n\nSo instead of saying \"we need fast travel\", how about we change the quests structures so we don't need it.\n\nThere are 2 choices I see:  \n- quests become very local, you stay in a very local area (accessible on foot) to complete the quest. no need to fast travel back and forth.  \n- quests are directional, the start at A, then B, then C (points which are in line). The \"another\" quests, around area C, would maybe encourage you to go back to A (passing by a D point in between). No fast travel, and the motivation to move is there.\n\n\nI hope this will stir up some discussions.\n\n\n",

        "text": "   This is something I've struggled with for a long time. While playing RPGs and other games that present the player with moral choices and ultimata, I often find it very difficult to put myself in the player character's shoes.\n\n   Typically the way I play these games is going from point A to point B killing mobs and collecting loot without much consideration for what I'm doing and why I'm doing it. While I do typically enjoy these sorts of experiences for their mechanics and sense of progression, I can't help but feel there's another layer of fun that I've missed out on playing these games throughout the years because of an inability to pretend that I actually *am* my player character. Normally all that's on my mind is how to maximize my rewards and increase my stats.\n\nFor example, I've tried many times to start a new playthrough of Skyrim whilst making a conscious effort to explore the world and treat every conversation as though I'm physically embodying my character, but it's never much longer than an hour before I realize I'm once again just going through the motions, completing objectives and clearing dungeons with a total lack of imagination. I really want to be able to immerse myself the way others seem able to, but there is a perpetual disconnect between myself and the screen.\n\nSo for those of you with more colorful senses of imagination than myself, how do you self-insert into the game instead of just engaging a cycle of feedback and input? What are some features in games past that have helped you immerse yourself? If one does not roleplay as their character, are they missing a fundamental (or at least significant) facet of the experience? Do you give characters backstories, complexes, etc. to make them feel a bit more real? What can game developers do to help invest the player in their character's actions and experiences rather than playing it by the numbers?",

The main plot of the story would involve a conflict between two opposing factions, and during an early game encounter the player would be able to choose to side with one of the two factions. The first act of the story would allow players to learn about one of the two factions in detail by going to their respective base of operations, and players would have the freedom to switch sides prior to the start of the second act, but after that point they would be locked in as an ally to that faction. \n\nLet's say that there are 10 key locations in the world of this JRPG and players would visit 8 of these locations on a full playthrough. 6 of the locations would be visited in both of the two story branches, while 4 of the locations are exclusive to one branch (2 for each branch). Some locations would be heavily recontexualized depending on which branch a player is on, while others would involve a direct conflict between the two factions in the story and the player would experience the conflict from one of the two sides. \n\nEach of the story branches would be fairly short, but they would have distinct tones, have some distinct gameplay mechanics, have a distinct set of bosses and mostly distinct enemies, and two party members exclusive to each story branch. The story branches would have mostly the same cast, but many characters who are your allies on once branch would be enemies on the other branch. The double-sided nature of the story would be used to show the perspective of the two factions involved in the conflict and to explore various characters from multiple angles. \n\n",

More over, there are consequences as a result of the faster vehicle turn rate, making a lot of the top tier cars uncontrollable at high speed, as it \"over reacts\" to my inputs.\n\nSo I wondered if the skill is of any mechanical benefit to the game at all.

Thats not including the fact that they are also doing the Wii U version of smash as well. Melee came out 17 years ago and it still has a giant spot in a big gaming tournament. \nI am not throwing any shade at it, but i find it extremely weird. With a game that old, its odd that they are catering for the newest version with the oldest (by far the best version of the game). With that kind of logic. Games like MvC2 or CvS2 should still be very active right? Would love yalls thoughts. ",

        "text": "Having not played Shadow of the Colossus in years, the PS4 remake has reminded me of just how stunning and beautiful the game is. It's a rare thing to find a game with a great narrative, and SotC has one of the most thoughtful and powerful stories in gaming. But holy crap - I had forgotten how wince-inducingly dreadful Dormin's dialogue is. It's not that it ruins the entire game for me or anything like that, but - put it this way - it's like listening to a beautiful orchestral concert where every so often the clarinettist inexplicably drags his chair across the floor in a horrible screeching sound.\n\nIt's not that the made-up language or soundwork is a problem: I actually find both those aspects pretty good. It's the writing itself, which is trying to make Dormin sound \"olde wolde\". Whoever wrote it probably had some vague memory of Chaucer or some other poet from the Middle-ages from their school days and thought that making Dormin say \"thou art\", \"thee\", \"thy\" and the \"est\"/\"eth\" suffix would portray him as a sufficiently ancient being.\n\nIt just doesn't work when you try to slap these archaisms into rather plain modern dialogue. Either write in a convincing medieval style or write in modern language: one or the other. This half-cocked approach of awkwardly shoehorning in a \"thou\" here and an \"est\" there just comes across as either laziness or ineptitude on the part of the writers. It's so distracting to have such a wonderful story with such mythic resonance that has such an amateurish aspect to it.\n\nIf you ask me, the dialogue should have been \"remade\" along with the graphics engine. Not that it's medieval in setting, but Bluepoint should have watched The Witch to learn how to write convincing archaic period dialogue.\n\nDoes this grate on anyone else?",

The lack of an in-game map, the lack of configurable difficulty, the precise and \"weighted\" combat, the incredibly deep RPG mechanics that drive the whole thing, the fact that you can make a character and start the damned game without having to sit through 30 minutes of cutscenes and dialogue. The whole thing is fucking brilliant and in my opinion, this aesthetic should take center stage as the future of console RPG's. \n\nThe combat in Dark Souls is so good, so strategically sensitive, that it not only blows away most action games, but also most other RPG combat systems, turn-based or otherwise. It's the finest superimposition of an RPG ruleset to an action-oriented environment that I've ever experienced.\n\nThere is one thing I'm on the fence about: the lack of an in-game map. Looking back, I know it would have probably resulted in a completely different experience, one that wouldn't have been as cathartic or relentless. \n\n",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/7vwxss/an_attempt_to_debunk_the_why_is_denuvo_bad/",
        "text": "[This article](https://whyisdenuvobad.github.io/) seems to get used as a talking points list by people trying to popularize a boycott of Denuvo enabled titles. \n\nI find parts of it honestly very out there and some points just plain wrong.\n\n. \n\n&gt; If you have a problem with your payment method on a later game purchase, your account will be disabled blocking all your Denuvo games from working. Steam support is notoriously slow to respond so your account may be disabled for weeks or months. Supporting the ability of platforms to disable your entire game library is anti-consumer.\n\nYou will also loose the ability to download any Steam game (Denuvo or not) that you have not installed momentarily and all online functionality stops working. And yet, you are still buying games that rely on Steam or other services I assume?!\n\n&gt; Denuvo stops games from supporting Linux or OS X. \n\nUnless you are a hardcore Linux fanatic I bet my left ball that you own Windows only titles or console only titles. Some of the Windows only titles will not run well enough under Wine and (nearly) none of the console exclusive titles can be played under Linux or MacOS. \n\nHonestly by this point, if anybody wants to play core games on PC they should just have Windows installed (at least as a second boot).\n\n&gt; Denuvo games require reactivation if you haven't played them in a while or if you change any of your computer's hardware, and you must authenticate with Denuvo servers every time you receive an update (Simply allowing Steam to update is not enough. You must also open the game once while connected to the internet after each update). They don't require always online, but they do require sometimes online. Some people don't believe this, so here's proof:\nhttp://i.imgur.com/hm32xle.png\n\n&gt; This is from a user that left it in offline mode for a week or so and didn't play it. This wasn't their first launch.\n\nFirst off, don't leave Steam offline for a week for no reason if you want to play Steam games. Secondly, this really only affects people that want to play certain games on their laptop, and in that case only those games. \n\nBut even than, you can just use your phone as a hotspot for a minute. Verification should neither take long, require the best connection nor use more than a few kilobyte of data volume. IMO a none issue in 2018. \n\n&gt; Denuvo makes it difficult or impossible to play games without some form of internet connection. Sure lots of people have internet connections, but not everyone does. Requiring an internet connection for offline single-player games is anti-consumer.\n\nThis is the same complaint as before, why are you repeating them? In general people that downloads games (many of them by now 50 GB or more per title + multiple GB big patches) have internet connection. If not (for example bought a game on retail that needs Steam) they can't even register the game, Denuvo or not. Verification should neither take long, require the best connection nor use more than a few kilobyte of data volume. IMO a none issue in 2018 (nice, now I am repeating myself as well)! If you have completely shitty internet, the 10 GB Day-One patch will surely be a bigger problem than Denuvo.\n\n&gt; If your internet drops without preparing for offline beforehand you can't play your Denuvo crapware.\n\nOr watch Netflix, Amazon Video, HBO Go, Youtube, Vimeo, PornHub, TubeGalore..., listening to Spotify, Pandora, Google Play Music..., you might as well just shoot yourself in if this happens. At the very least I assume you are not paying for any of the above services, am I right?!\n\n&gt; If at some point in the future any part of their DRM service chain is shut down due to internet outage or a company going bankrupt, games will be inaccessible. Some people reply \"but surely these companies will provide a method access if they are shutting down servers!\" If a company is in bankruptcy and there's an outcry to get patches out for 15 year old games, I doubt they're going to make it a priority to devote resources and development time to creating patches. It wouldn't be the first time a library of DRM-encumbered crapware went poof. Remember the single-player game Darkspore? It is impossible for anyone to play it anymore. Neither pirates nor customers can play it. They didn't release a patch to make it work offline. Here's what it shows up as on Origin:\nSupporting an ecosystem which could disappear your games is anti-consumer.\n\nFirst off all, Denuvo will not shut down because of an internet outtage?! Unless you assume that the internet will at some point world wide shut down for months or years...? \n\nOther than that, this is actually a very good and reasonable reason to not buy a Denuvo supported title. But at the same time, online MP services for games that many people only die because of the online MP are shutting down all the time. By that logic, you shouldn't buy any games for their MP portion at all. You certainly shouldn't spend money on F2P titles (which are mostly online) either, so no buying packs for Hearthstone, Elder Scrolls Legends etc. \n\nAnd you also shouldn't be spending any money on other services that rely on an online backend, like Netflix, Amazon Video, HBO Go, Vimeo, Spotify, Pandora or anything from Google that isn't a phone, tablet or speaker. Actually forget about the last one, all digital assistant boxes also need a backend, so no Amazon Echo either. \n\n&gt; In many cases after an online game has their servers shut down, modders can get the online portion working again by modifying the executable to work with a new master server list. With Denuvo, when EA says the online fun is over that's the end of it because modders won't be able to fix the game. That's anti-consumer.\n\nThe cases in which I can years after a game got released just download a crack to get rid of a copy protection / DRM / anti temper algorithm that isn't getting supported anymore far outnumber the amount of shut down MP titles that I can reasonably (meaning more than two persons online per day) play by a preposterous amount.\n\n&gt; Having Denuvo on your games means that if a game comes out that's Oculus Rift only and has strong anti-tamper protections, you'll have no way to ever get it working on other VR platforms. Anti-consumer vendor lock-in.\n\nCompletely wrong, I am a Rift owner for over a year but also very active under /r/Vive. All the Rift exclusive games released by Oculus (of which some actually use Denuvo) can be played via with the Vive or other headsets supporting Open VR / Steam VR via a wrapper called Revive (of course with issues like horrible controls or bugs in some cases). Hacking the exe is not necessary at all. \n\n&gt; Denuvo locks you into your purchase platform for now to eternity. If you purchase a Denuvo game on Steam, you must use Steam forever or abandon your purchases to the wind. If your Steam account gets hacked or locked, your games are gone, because they were never really yours, and you never really even had a copy of them.\n\nTrue, but the same is true for any game with an online component that you are interested in. \n\n&gt; You can't make playable back-ups of your games. This isn't helping the consumer.\n\nFirst off, backups of games are not needed anymore. You can just redownload them. Other than that, you can still backup your Steam folder like you always could. This will free you from having to redownload the game after you for example reinstalled Windows or moved to a new PC.\n\nEither this is a completely made up reason or I don't understand the author.\n\n&gt; A large point of Denuvo is to enable vendors and publishers to lock down the functionality of their games and provide them with a simplified means of doing all the bad anti-consumer things they've always wanted to do. While Denuvo copy protection may not in and of itself do the something bad (\"see Denuvo does nothing wrong!\") it enables the publishers to do it.\n\nThis argument makes only sense if the author wants to tell us that its ok to pirate games that include \"some bad anti-consumer thing by the publisher\". Its not really ok. Also Star Wars Battle Front 2 shows that publishers don't need Denuvo to be cunts and that we as consumers don't need to steal games to successfully fight them. \n\nBuying a game on Steam, Origin and Co; leaving a bad rating that informs people about the issue and then refunding makes a way bigger impact than sitting silently at home while playing a pirated copy. \n\n",

        "text": "I'm a fanboy of Super Mario World for a variety of reasons, and one of the biggest is its progression structure. [I already made a post about that before](https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/71clnj/super_mario_worlds_world_design/), but this time, I would like to like to ask a related question:\n\nWould it be feasible for games of any genre to adopt Super Mario World's overall structure in these times? Considering there's this present duality between open world and linearity and there have been backlashes to either side, if not towards the duality as a whole, I feel that doing what Super Mario World did with overall structure would do wonders in combining the best of both worlds.\n\nWhen I mean \"Super Mario World structure\", there are six core criteria that I am looking for:\n\n* There is a definite beginning and end to the overall world.\n\n* You have to clear an individual area/level's goal to move to the next area on the path.\n\n* There are multiple paths in the overall world from the beginning to the end, branching and recombining at certain points.\n\n* You have to actively *search* for these alternate routes; it shouldn't be as simple as being presented with a fork in the road and choosing left or right.\n\n* You don't strictly have to complete every area/level just to beat the game.\n\n* You're free to go back to earlier areas to search for paths to different areas and/or other secrets.\n\nIf I recall, the closest things to this sort of progression (if not fitting it completely) in the current and past gen would be BioWare's seventh-gen output (Mass Effect OT and Dragon Age: Origins) and the Soulsborne series.\n\nStill, with all of the complaints of both linear and open world games, I think those six criteria would be a nice alternative to either extreme. You have a clear focused goal, you're allowed to explore and find secrets, and many of those secrets are sets of environments with their own unique combinations of obstacles and enemies (as opposed to, say, 50 money or 20 exp or something).\n\nHowever, I recognize that there are some limitations on implementing this kind of structure with any budget. For example, making a wide variety of focused, well-crafted levels wouldn't be too conducive to \"filler\", something of a necessary evil with big budgets and the desire to make games long as possible. Also, graphics and advertising considered, a game with SMW structure could seem too short unless a potentially unrealistic amount of money is poured into design.\n\nSo with all of these benefits and drawbacks, could any modern game, from indie to AAA and of any genre, implement a \"Super Mario World structure\" for the overall game? I feel it would be very nice to see but would understand if it isn't ideal in the current climate.",
