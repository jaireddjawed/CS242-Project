Later on I logged on to chrome only to notice that it had no logo and had been using Yahoo to search. I found this really frustrating but I got over it. When I googled why it was happening I learned about hijacking and others and I really got scared (I am very easily scared when it comes to computer things). I didn't have any antivirus at the time so I quickly downloaded AVG and scanned a bunch of times but it didn't find anything. I left my PC open and untouched and nothing changed back neither there were pop ups. Later a friend recommended me to download Malwarebytes which I did and after scanning it found 13 suspicious files which I quarantined and deleted immediately. I didn't check where most of them came from but most of them where from uTorrent which I had downloaded since December. Nothing else has happened since and there have been 4 hours since the initial notice of strange behaviour. It feels like my PC is ok but only time will tell.\n\nNote: the last thing I downloaded was 5 days ago and it was supposedly a game but couldn't open but until today nothing bad happened + the site had positive recommendation in trust pilot and reddit.\n\nAlso a relative of me used my computer this weekend and he could have made the changes himself.

The day-to-day work is ok, for the most part my work has been with tools/tech that is proprietary so not much I can put on my resume if I wanted to jump ships. I did however work on a big cool project that had a lot of good tech like Java, Kafka, REST, but that was once. I feel like I am growing there technically but not as much as I'd like to. I do the technical learning by actively reading blog posts on medium.\n\nRecently I've got an offer from JP Morgan Chase for a level 3 SWE role in the same area. The pay offered is 60% more than what I am getting at Goldman. Is it worth making the jump? How is engineering there vs. GS? I am afraid that with this big of a pay, there will be a big responsibility that I am not up to. GS has really been good to me but the pay there isn't great and technical development isn't where I'd like it to be. However we just got our projects for the year and that involves a lot of migrating things to the cloud and stuff maybe it would be good technical exposure?\n\nFor JPMC offer, in order to be matched with a team, I'd have to first accept the offer and this puts me in a position where I can be matched with a team I do not want. I wanted to also let my current manager know at GS before I proceed with any action with JPMC. I'd stay at GS if the pay was better because this new project looks fun. Btw JPMC is giving me 2 days to accept when they send out official offer Monday.\n\nWhat do you think? What should I do?",

This is my current situation:\n\n* I own a decent desktop PC (Windows) and plan to do the majority of my work on it.\n* I recently was gifted a Galaxy Tab S8+ for taking notes, but I can also use it as a second screen or even use Remote Desktop if I feel like it so I could use it as a \"proper\" computer.\n* I also have a old HP Pro Book Laptop (i5, 4GB RAM, HDD &amp; Windows) which is \"good enough\" for doing basic tasks . Upgrading the laptop (SSD + at least 8GB RAM) wouldn't be worth it since the parts are too expensive.\n\nHere are some of my questions:\n\n* Does it even make sense for me to upgrade my laptop within the next few years? I don't think so but I may be missing out on something.\n* Should I try to install Linux on the laptop to gain some experience with it since it's so widely used within the CS community? \n* Should I try to sell the laptop before it loses all its value for maybe \\~100€ and cough up 200 more so I can buy a somewhat decent working laptop (Thinkpad T450/470 or something) over the next few months? \n\nI'm asking because I will probably be broke for around 2 months because I need to move and be really careful with my (barely existant) savings for a while after moving to a different city. I live in Europe so tech stuff is a bit more expensive here.",

As an international student, I have been taking care of myself since 2019 and have had to work part-time as a server to pay for college and living expenses. While this job may not be relevant experience, it has taught me a lot as a person. Despite the constricted time between work and classes, I have maintained a GPA of 3.95, which may drop a few points by the time I am done.\n\nI am looking to continue my education by pursuing a Master's in Computer Science at a top-tier university like UT Austin, Georgia Tech, University of Washington, among others. However, I have been rejected in more than 100 applications for SWE internships due to a lack of side projects, and research opportunities with CS faculty at FSU have also been difficult to come by.\n\nRecently, I was offered an opportunity to work with chemistry scientists at the MagLab in Tallahassee, a prestigious laboratory worldwide. While the work is basic data handling in Python, they offer many benefits, including good hourly pay, which will allow me to quit my job as a server and tutor, and a lot of support for my education. However, I am unsure if this research will be relevant to improve my resume and help me get into a top-tier grad school. While it may be better than serving experience, it is not a CS research, and I won't be doing much. On the other hand, I could apply again for some research with the CS faculty, and I am confident that I could get something, but I wouldn't get many benefits.\n\nI am torn between taking the MagLab opportunity or looking for CS research. While I am pretty sure I could get a research position with the CS faculty, I won't get much help from them, and they are known for just changing the name on a recommendation letter template they have. The MagLab, on the other hand, makes a lot of emphasis on wanting me to thrive and help me with my education. They are willing to help me a lot, and I see they care about me as a human being.\n\nI am seeking advice on what to do. Should I look for a CS research position, or should I take the MagLab opportunity? Which one will give me better chances of getting into a top-tier school? I apologize for the long post, but I wanted to provide as much information as possible to help you understand the situation. Thank you in advance for your help\n\nPD: I want to focus my MS in ML, so thats why i think data handling in python could be somewhat relevant, since I have been trying to train myself on Data Science (From what I understand, it is a good way to start my path in ML)",

        "text": "Hi guys,\n\nFor context - I live in Vancouver and currently work on an IT helpdesk. I am lukewarm on the idea of becoming a data analyst. Don't think I'd hate it but don't think I'd LOVE it.\n\nI am currently one year into a three year bachelor of Data Analytics degree. After further thought and looking into the Data Analytics job market, I thought it would be better to study a three year bachelor of Information Technology degree. I figured it would be easier to have a IT degree and get a data analytics job (if I wanted to after graduating), rather than get into an non data job with a data analytics degree. If chose to swap degrees, all my courses would carry over to the new IT degree and I would not lose any 'progress' thus the IT degree would only be two years.\n\nI believe I would like to go into the software side of things. Not sure exactly what in software (maybe programming and development), but working with hardware doesn't excite me. I know that if I am wanting to go down this path, a bachelor of computer science degree is probably more fitting and would open up a lot more doors than the other two degrees. However, if I transferred into a CS degree, I would lose my completed Uni courses 'progress' and have to start from scratch.\n\nIf I went down the IT degree route, finished the degree, and then decided I wanted to go into software, do you think it would be hard to find a job assuming I do a lot of self lead online study and online courses in the field (at this stage likely programming and development)?\n\nWhat would you recommend, go down the IT route supplementing with online courses/self lead education my desired field (when I fully decide) or lose the 'progress' start from scratch and start the CS degree?\n\nThanks!",

In particular, I feel that my current level of understanding is that the one-way hash function produces a hash of some data in such a way that it's virtually impossible to predict what the original data was, and also that they're uniquely determined (i.e. collision-free, either completely or almost?).\n\nI'm something of a math person (original B.S. is in math, and kept math up as kind of a hobby?) so I would hope to be able to answer the question of how it can be known that the values coming from the hash function are unique and also irreversible.\n\nI understand the best explanation is likely very technical but I hope to at least be able to be convinced in an \"overview\" kind of sense that I understand it better. Are there resources around that cover this topic, but somewhere in between \"vague description\" and \"here are the proofs of all of these theorems etc. etc.\"?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks in advance!",

The proportion of content generated by AI is only going to increase as it becomes more mainstream.\n\nHow will training datasets account for this?

        "text": "* [Towards Distributed Logic Programming based on Computability Logic](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.07036.pdf)\n\nI'm interested in LP like Prolog so this seems interesting to me, but hoping to be clearer on how such a lang would work. They seem to be proposing an LP lang based on [Computability logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computability_logic) as opposed to \"classical logic\" like FOL. Here's a nice [overview of complog](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.04513.pdf) but from the wiki, one thing I was curious about was\n\n&gt;**In classical logic, formulas represent true/false statements. In CoL, formulas represent computational problems**. In classical logic, the validity of a formula depends only on its form, not on its meaning. In CoL, validity means being always computable. More generally, classical logic tells us when the truth of a given statement always follows from the truth of a given set of other statements. Similarly, CoL tells us when the computability of a given problem A always follows from the computability of other given problems B1,...,Bn. Moreover, it provides a uniform way to actually construct a solution (algorithm) for such an A from any known solutions of B1,...,Bn.\n\nWhat would this look like implemented as a programming language? I'm trying to imagine it compared to know I know from prolog. So in prolog\n\n    foo(X) :- bar(X), baz(X). \n\nhead is true if body is true, right? So this is that boolean logic they mention, but how would this be different? I tried looking at section 6 Examples but got kinda lost, however from what I can understand, it does seem very similar to regular FOL. Also how would the \"games\" between agents they mention come into play?",

We are building a web app for a small startup to give quotes for a 3dpriting business. \n\nWe want users to upload files, view the file they uploaded, change different options like material for the print, colour etc, and then they can be shown a quote or emailed the quote essentially \n\nWe are trying to decide what technologies for this and have a. Few questions\n\n1. Thinking of a react front end but not sure if this is needed really, we dont have too much react experience and apparently we could just do this with html css and JS. It will have to look slick \n\n2. For the backend we were thinking of connecting this with a flask backend but not sure if that will be a problem and we should use nodejs\n\n3. We are also using some libraries to read these files (.stl, .step, .obj, .3mf) like three js or pyvista, so if we do three js then we have to basically render this client side and if we use pyvista we would use flask and render server-sider. Our website gets like 300-500 hits month so not too sure what we should go with\n\n4. Thinking a deployment service and wondering if we can get away with the basic plan on herouku or we have to go for the production standard 1X. Honestly just a bit lost with deployment in general so any resources would be good\n\nJust been a bit lost designing this web App and trying to connect everything and we are all bit inexperienced, one of us has some JS experience and the rest is python and 1 go lang",

However, as academia is very tough, I want to keep my options open for industry as well.\n\n1. Do you know what the industry job prospects are for HCI after phd?\n\n2. A lot of HCI research focuses on surveying and does not involve programming. Do you think this might cause me to lose programming skills and cause me problems during job search?\n\n3. How difficult would be to get a job in another topic e.g. ML, Networking or software development if my phd is on a HCI topic? I guess I will be doing courses on these extra topics during the 5 years. Will the coursework be enough to get jobs?   \nOr, will I be rejected in favor of other people with Phd/publications in these topics?",
