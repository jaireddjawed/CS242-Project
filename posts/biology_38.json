Do genes make the brain know that breasts = food somehow? And I'm not just talking about breastfeeding; how do all animals know to do some things by default/know things they were not trained to do or gained through knowledge/trial and error? Like apparently male giraffes nudge female giraffes' butts when they want to mate, which leads to the female peeing and the male tasting the pee to know if the female is ovulating or not. I have so many questions: how do the females know to pee if a male nudges their butts if this was the first time that this happens to them? How do the males know that tasting the pee will lead them to know if the female is ovulating or not if no one has taught them? How do the males know what pee tastes like when females are ovulating and when they're not? And biggest question: why do the males care if the female is ovulating or not? It's not like they understand the concept of having kids and want to have kids, right? They just want to release dopamine from having sex, no?",

I applied to a six-year Ph.D. program at a dream school and to the MS program at the university I am still at. I just got my rejection letter from the Ph.D. program, which makes me anxious about my MS program. I'm a pretty good student overall, I have a 3.5 GPA which, while I know isn't perfect, I'm highly involved in greek life, in charge of multiple clubs, and do a lot of volunteer work in my community. I also worked as an RA for 3 years, which takes up a significant portion of my time. \n\nIt isn't as though I really want to go to graduate school, I just don't know what to do after college. All of the lab jobs that take plain old bachelor's degrees require 2+ years of experience in highly specialized fields that don't have any entry-level positions, and none of the university lab jobs are full-time, but still require enough time that I couldn't take a second job, and so I would be unable to support myself financially.\n\nThe feedback I received from my application stemmed from a lack of real lab experience, despite being a decently qualified candidate, other candidates were also qualified AND had lab experience. I feel like it's a catch-22. How can you get lab experience if you don't have enough experience to get a lab job?\n\nIf anyone currently working with biology degrees has any advice, I would really appreciate it. I love genetics, I love microbiology! Some of the most rewarding college experiences were in class labs. I feel like I wasted 4 years getting a degree I can't use.",

I have searched online for some things that clash the 2 subjects together, and I have come up with bioinformatics, pharmacoinformatics and biomaths. \n\nI was wondering if any biology students who are in a math heavy field would be able to provide some kind of insight into any of these:\n\n* What do bioinformaticians/biomathematicians/pharmacoinformaticians actually do?\n* Does biotechnology (or can biotechnology) involve a lot of maths?\n* What are the real world consequences of biomathematical/bioinformatics/pharmacoinformatics research?\n* If you're in bioinformatics or biomaths or biotech or pharmacoinformatics, what do you do day-to-day?\n* Are there any careers I'm missing in my list of 3 subjects I'm looking at that might be useful for me to look into?\n* Are there any math/bio combo subjects that would still allow at least some wet lab time (bc i just love doing sometime with a test tube no matter what it is lmao)?\n\nI understand that there's like 90 questions there, but if anyone could answer 1 or 2 I would be really grateful as I don't wanna waste my student loan on a degree that gets me into the wrong job.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks! :)",

I thought about taking just chemistry but decided against it,so now I'm kinda between biology and biochemistry. I do somewhat of an idea as to what I can expect with biology but I'm really not sure. So what I'm asking is really what can I generaly expect to be doing if I decide to choose biology i.e. what I can expect to be doing (as in academically) and what kind of job opportunities will I have.  \nJust as a ps personally I'm really interested in diseases and viruses and that sort of stuff and I'm usure as to what lenght is that sort of stuff taught when it comes to biology vs biochemistry.  \nThank you all in advance",

It is a very different cactus from those we know from arid and semi-arid regions. This cactus is an obligate epiphyte, as its seeds only germinate on trees, endemic to the Americas, occurring in humid tropical and subtropical forests, in Brazil it occurs in the Atlantic Forest. Its xeromorphic characteristics, which adapt it to dry environments, are maintained in the epiphytic environment of trees, due to limited water. It is popularly called \"cacto-macarrão\" and \"ripsales\" and the most frequent in the trees is the species scientifically called Rhipsalis baccifera. It has scenic and ecological importance, providing food for birds and forming plant communities in trees. Ripsalis, from the \"Cactaceae\" family, is very similar to the aveloz from the \"Euphorbiaceae\" family, due to its cylindrical and green stem, but the aveloz has an irritating and caustic latex",

        "text": "Copy and pasted from Wikipedia\n\nPrions in plants In 2015, researchers at The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston found that plants can be a vector for prions. When researchers fed hamsters grass that grew on ground where a deer that died with chronic wasting disease (CWD) was buried, the hamsters became ill with CWD, suggesting that prions can bind to plants, which then take them up into the leaf and stem structure, where they can be eaten by herbivores, thus completing the cycle. It is thus possible that there is a progressively accumulating number of prions in the environment.[83][84]\n\nCompanies such as Recompose say ''we will exclude people who have died from diagnosed prion disease''\n\nHow is the logic of ''if they haven't had symptomatic prion disease you're safe'' any different to: ''if you don't have any symptoms, you cannot transmit COVID''?\n\nThe asymptomatic incubation period for prion disease can last for decades. They will have infectious prions growing inside of them for years, while not displaying any symptoms. A diagnosis is made once symptoms show. If a person were to die of unrelated causes during the incubation period, they would slip through the cracks.",
