        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SoftwareEngineering/comments/6t4slz/an_horrific_testing_strategy/",
        "text": "Dear developers,\n\nLet's say you are working on a drawing software and that you want to develop a function drawTurtle() that draw a (perhaps parameterized) turtle. The implementation of this function uses a lot of the tools your drawing API provides, like pen, color, shapes, brushes, etc. \n\nThe most naive way to test this function is manual testing. You just print the turtle and you verify that it looks like what you expected. You can improve this naive solution by saving the printed turtle to a file, let's say a PNG. Then, an automated tests can load the reference PNG (that you'll need to commit) and compare it against the PNG that toPNG(drawTurtle()) returns. A problem with this strategy is that if you change any parameter that describe the turtle drawing, like the resolution, you'll likely need to also change the reference PNG. Another problem with this strategy is that it interacts with the file system, so you probably shouldn't include this test in your unit test suite. Hence, the test won't be run very often and it might take you a while to learn if you broke drawTurtle() with some modifications.\n\nYou can also test the function drawTurtle() by using a mock tool. This will allow you to make sure that each of the methods in your API are called as you expect. The advantage of this test is speed. You'll likely be able to include this test into your unit test suite, therefor getting direct feedback if you break drawTurtle(). However, if the turtle that you are drawing if very complicated, the test will either be also very complicated (you'll more or less need to hardcode the turtle), or it will only test a few characteristic of the drawTurtle() method.\n\nThis lead my colleague to this new strategy. He wrote the function drawTurtle() once, manually inspected that the result was good, then, he copy-pasted the drawTurtle() implementation in a drawExpectedTurtle() method of the test fixture! I was horrified when I saw this while doing the code review. Then, he explained his rational to me, which is basically the 3 previous paragraphs I wrote here. He assured me that he would never refactor drawTurtle() and drawExpectedTurtle() at the same time. He told me that the tests where fast and allowed him to be confident while doing some refactoring.\n\nI feel that we are doing something very wrong, but I can't find any better way to achieve our goal. What are you thoughts on the matter?",

        "text": "Hi, I'm 18 years old and about to start my university path to take a degree in software engineering (here in Italy it's called something like Engineering of Computer Science). I'm really happy about my decision knowing this will lead to get a job I love. In italy if you succeed to obtain an engineering degree you will find a work quite easily, but the reward is really poor if you consider the skills you collected at university and the late nights you spent studying (2500 Euros if you are experienced vs 1500 if you are high school teacher). I can also add that works are totally different in Italy both from the rest of the Europe and from United States too, people here got another kind of mentality (quick examples: you are treated mostly like a number, they don't care if you helped and how much you helped, people here get promotions not for the skills but mostly because they know someone in the ownership that can help to get the promotion; you probably won't believe these but it works like this, exceptions are really rare to find). During the last year I read lots of articles about how good is the Silicon Valley for our kind of degree, how much creativity is present there, and how many work possibilities can this area offer to you (even read articles from Italian people that said their life completely changed when they moved there)\nbut it's really that easy to get a job there if you are from another country but enough experienced? \nIf you have good potentials and skills are they going to assume you? \nI read a lot also about networking, which should be an important lack for foreign students that want to come there to work, is it really necessary? \nAnd last but not least, my English is not perfect, I think they can understand me but it really matters that point during the interview if you have the skills they need?\n\nAnother question, how long does it take to get a software engineering degree in USA? Here in Italy we have 3 years (first one is in common with every kind of engineering course) and then we can choose to keep studying for 2 more years to get the highest kind of degree, and I think I'm going to since if you have more skills you will have more opportunities. So it's 3 years basic degree and 2 more years for the master degree\n\nThanks a lot for clarifying me these topics",

Afterwards, there will be a (optional) set of profiling questions -- you may leave them all unanswered if you like, but your answers would be of a great help in order to better characterize all the data.\n\nYour privacy will be respected -- even if you provide us your name and e-mail (which, again, are optional), such data are not going to be on the results database that we plan to make public after the end of the study.\n\nThe survey can be found here [http://codereadability.ime.usp.br] and will stay open until September, 8th, 2017.

However, I have always loved software development and CS, so I decided to enroll in Arizona State University's Software Engineering program.

I have been working on some basic projects on my own and I am actually developing a mobile app with a friend of mine as well. \n\nWhat I'm wondering is should I still start to apply this year for summer internships? I'm really not enjoying the company I work for right now (been there 4 years) and I don't know if I can really wait another whole year to start applying. Any advice? I just want to make sure I'll be prepared for these internships. Is there any way to prepare for them before I take my Discrete Math and Advanced Data Structures / Algorithms class? ",

I'm 1 class away from graduating with a degree in psychology because I was young and made stupid choices. I'm 25 and I want better . I want to learn to code and I want a career in it. Yes I am aware that it wont be easy.\nAnyways, is revature worth it ? Has anyone done it ? What worries me the most is the 2 year commitment . Basically you must work for them for 2 years or else something happens? Not sure what . They also expect you to relocate anywhere they want to send you. That worries me a bit as a woman whose never even lived alone. They are a for profit company so their best interest is themselves, not my own. Im worried about getting placed in a crap job with a crap salary and being forced to work there... or worse, not getting placed and being stuck in limbo where I cant get a job.\nSo if anyone has had experience with this , please share. Is it worth it to just take the dip and go into debt for a coding bootcamp else where? Or going into debt to go back to school for a degree in computer science?",
