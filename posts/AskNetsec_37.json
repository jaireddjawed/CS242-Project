(Weirdly, the invoice included the shipping address, which I passed along to the police in the town where the address was).\n\n* Immediately afterward, my GMail was flooded with activation emails from 55 different vendors, most of them non-US but they appeared random.\n\n* My Facebook account had also been pwned.\n\n* However, there was no evidence my GMail account itself was accessed. The account history was all in order and none of the weird store activation emails appeared to have been clicked on or read.\n\n* I've changed all passwords to unique, long passwords, which I should have done a long time ago. Every account I could remember. Wife's accounts, too.\n\nCredit card is deactivated and company is sending a new one. All credit bureau reports are frozen.\n\nI really, really don't want to have to mothball my Gmail account. Changed the password, did 2-factor, etc. Should it be good to go? Do I need to do anything about those weird vendors?",

        "text": "Hi, I'm a second year college student working towards an information security degree. I've been having some second thoughts about my major recently and I thought it would be a good idea to get some perspective here.\n\n\nI've been looking for ways to beef up my resume (A lot of people in my college tend to take internships around this time) and I hear a lot that doing things like personal projects, CTFs, etc in your spare time is really important. I have been interested in doing infosec projects in my spare time since I still have a lot of prerequisite classes to complete before I start any infosec classes, but when I tried doing these side projects, I didn't feel motivated to continue doing them. The area that sounded most interesting to me was malware reverse engineering, so I gave malware unicorn's RE101 tutorial a try, finished it, and didn't really know where to go from there. After that, I started reading [re4b](beginners.re), found it really daunting and lost interest after a few days.\n\n\nI haven't felt interested in any other areas of infosec (admittedly I haven't spent a lot of time looking, my coursework eats up a lot of my time and motivation) so I'm thinking there's a decent chance I'm not cut out for this field. Should I start looking at other majors or should I try some other infosec stuff even if it doesn't sound like it'd be my sort of thing?\n\n\nThe second question I have regards work/life balance with infosec careers. I read a lot that people in this field need to spend  time outside of work doing research, reading up on articles, doing personal infosec projects, etc. On average, what percentage of your free time do you spend doing infosec related things?",

I do visit China almost annually, and do nothing else besides visit family and relax.\n\n3.) I maintain contact with my father and grandparents there, none of which hold any ties with the government and government related jobs\n\nEven just looking back on these make me skeptical of my eligibility.

        "text": "UPDATE: Too much to reply to ... so I will do it up here. The phone number I found through copious googling was clearly a scam. It turns out the video’s title yielded about 6 solid pages of the video on other websites. I contacted the major websites thru email and support tickets and luckily, 90% of the other links depended on the original source of major porn sites. I effectively got most of it taken down myself. I just claimed copyright infringement. I am not and was never underage in this video - I panicked. I’m not perfect. I thought it would help me out. I am so deeply disturbed I was finally “recognized.” I wanted to go into a competitive field that will blacklist me from every grad school and cost me my career if I am ever “outed.” I am now wondering if I should even bother. The worst part ... I have the rarest hair color of them all. And I have some very distinct tattoos. Yes, I used to be less of an idiot and wear a wig and cover my tattoos, but of course it was uncomfortable and time consuming. I truly hate myself right now, so thanks for the comments about “these are my consequences for being a whore.” Fuck those of you who thought/sent me that, you don’t know what it’s like to have so many things go wrong that you’re drowning. I won’t bore anyone with the details. I am a good person who was in a tight spot. To those of you who commented nice/constructive things, thank you so much. I did about as much as I can do until another video surfaces and I (or someone else) finds it. If it comes up again and I go through with my career, I will probably chop off most of my ass-length hair and dye it. Yay me. I will leave this up since it is my throwaway and I hope it may help others someday. \n\nAgain, I contacted the main offending websites that were most popular and searched for their support emails, support ticket forms, video takedown forms, etc. I only claimed copyright infringement and it was down within hours. I would try this before shelling out the $200+ DCMA and similar services want. I am also aware there are/will be more content of me somewhere ... I am going to regularly search the original video title to try to stay on top of it. I also tried to reverse image search the thumbnail of the video to no avail. I will never wipe it off the Internet entirely. Mistakes were made. Here’s to hoping I can continue my life normally without my friends, family or colleagues finding it. Cheers. \n\nOh, and why this sub? I wanted info on how to take the video down. I appreciate the comments about lawyering up, but that’s exactly why I bypassed r/legaladvice. Ultimately, someone has to send a cease &amp; desist notice so I figured I could get it done faster on my own. I don’t think the $200 services are necessary. I also now realize my computer is probably compromised, mostly because my dumb ass downloaded and screen shared with scam artists. So yeah, don’t do that either, folks. \n\n—————————————————\n\nAn acquaintance randomly texts me they’ve been forwarded porn of me. \n\nIt is me. It’s on a popular website. It’s from my cam girl days when I was barely scraping by. I thought I had deleted it all - someone recorded a session and posted it six months ago. Already has 50k+ views. \n\nI’m screaming inside. I called the website. I lie and tell them I *was* underage to expedite the process. They insist I do a screen share thing. They show me multiple IPs from Mexico have turned off my firewall and used MY IP ADDRESS to upload. They say if they remove it, it will only be uploaded again. \n\nThey demand I pay either $400 for a 3-year plan or $700 for lifetime protection. They will remove all videos off anywhere on the Internet. They tried to rush me into a decision, but I got off the phone and said I’d call back. \n\nI can barely afford that. Idk if it will even work. All the other takedown services have yet to get back to me - and most of them charge per website, but supposedly it will only resurface again???\n\nPlease help.

I see it listed in many offense related job postings.\n\nFYI, I have been Pen Testing (mainly Web Apps) for a little over a year now but was in various IT/InfoSec roles for 10 years prior to that. Have the CISSP, CEH, Sec+ (to cover 8570) and the GWAPT. By mid-summer I plan to obtain the eCPPT (for learning purposes/fun) and then the OSCP.\n\nI am tired of certs but at least the eCPPT and OSCP are more real world focused and that excites me. Just wondering if there is any benefit with the GPEN down the road for me, since I can get my employer to pay for most of it in Fall 2018 or Q1 2019. I have a feeling it is not worth it in terms of ROI, but may be for just the knowledge itself.\n\nAppreciate any input! ",

So far we haven't even touched anything related to security in those two years, the last year is strictly security though (pentesting, malware and vuln analysis, ethical hacking, crypto, wireless security, etc).\n\nHowever, last September (2017) I landed a job at the Federal Govt in Canada, and I work in SOC. I'm only a Jr Security Analyst because of my student status. I was so hyped at first because it would give me a lot of experience before actually graduating.. but holy fucking shit is it boring. I don't hate it but... I'm not far from hating it. All I do is look at our logs to see if anything bad happened, do writeups about the newest vulns and exploits, and TRA's (threats and risk assessments). Which btw, TRA's are actually the worst thing I've ever done, absolutely hate it. \n\nLast semester I had a teacher who was younger than I am (I'm pushing 31) and he was 23. He graduated from the same college I'm going to, but instead of taking the course I took, he went with software engineering. He is 24 I think, and makes about 140k a year at 24. My mind was blown. He also made me REALLY enjoy coding in Python, I thought the labs and homework/exams he gave us were actually really cool because with some fine-tuning, it's something that could be used in the real world. \n\nSo, /r/AskNetSec I guess I would like to hear your advice about this. \n\nMy plan after school was to get the CEH cert and OSCP and then apply at the Canadian intelligence agencies.. but I don't know if I'll hold out that long with how things are going. \n\nDisclaimer: I know next to nothing about infosec and pentesting, so because I've only been exposed to blue-teaming, I don't have anything to compare it to.\n\nThanks for the read",

Let's say someone stole my TLS cert private key, how exactly do they then impersonate my webserver? Let's say the attacker had a MITM position between me and the real webserver. What specifically do they do next?\n\nMy guess is they poison the dns response and say \"I'm example.com\" Simple enough to understand, but why bother stealing the cert if at this point you could just send your own x509 cert, let's say one from let's encrypt, and now you're in business.",

        "text": "Hi.\n\nI just realized a couple of hours ago that some of my accounts have been hacked. Luckily they weren't anything necessary, or personally identifying (I hope). While I wasn't doing what I should have been doing, having a different password for every single account I own, I was using a sort of password grouping system. I had six (strong) passwords for various types of accounts. That's how I know that nothing serious was compromised (I hope).\n\nAs soon as I realized that I'd been hacked (two of my accounts that I was sure of the password for weren't accepting my password), I quickly moved to change the password of all the sites I could think of / still had access to. My biggest downfall, I think, was that I logged into a site that didn't have a properly configured HTTPS connection with a password that I used on other accounts. Won't happen again. I've also since installed HTTPS Everywhere. I hope that'll help with general security.\n\nI always took pride in my general security common sense. I always used passwords that were far stronger than my peers, I had more passwords than my peers, and I changed them more regularly than my peers. Turns out that that doesn't make much of a difference when you make a stupid mistake.\n\nMy questions are:\n\n* Will HTTPS Everywhere help with this kind of stuff?\n* Will a VPN help with this kind of stuff / suggestions on good VPNs?\n* How frequently should passwords be changed?\n* Any tips to help prevent this from happening again?\n* Anything else you think might be helpful to tell me?",
