Most of them basically read from slides. \n\nAs a students we usually tasked with make presentation on some topic, which usually require just copy last text from legislation. Or copy past after some Googling. \n\nWe were never recommended to read any scientific paper and if not for my interest and knowledge of English, I wouldn't have known they even exist. \n\nIs it normal for bachelor degree and all scientific staff just starts at master level?

        "text": "Hey y'all\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the past year or two my ADHD has been acting up, making it even harder for me to read/concentrate on anything. This has certainly made it harder for me to complete my schoolwork, but I've powered through the past few years and even strengthened my test scores\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, I've found that I've been developing headaches from using too much willpower to concentrate on my reading. My mind likes to wander around *a lot* so I pretty much have to expend all my energy on keeping it focused. Within ten minutes of working I already have a slight migraine and I'm forced to take a thirty minute break if I want it to go away. I've looked this up and no, I'm pretty sure that it isn't eye strain because the pain has nothing to do with my eyes. Because of this my work has been taking wayyyy longer than it should be. A one hour assignment will take me three hours on average. Just now, for example, I attempted to read through another section of my Calc textbook (I'm in quarantine for the next week and decided to get ahead), and after ten minutes I developed a really bad headache and couldn't continue. If I try to focus any less then I don't retain anything I read, so using less energy isn't exactly an option.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyone else struggled with this? This is really frustrating me",

Since i am applying for quite a few universities, I have approached 3 professors. The teachers i approached have requested me to draft the crux of the LOR and they will then have a look and do the necessary changes and then upload to the universities. I couldn't draft 3 different LORs, so i decided to keep the draft content same and have each teacher submit to their set of unique universities, so no university gets the SAME LOR TEMPLATE FROM 2 DIFFERENT TEACHERS. Unfortunately, my consultant screwed up and has uploaded to a UK university 2 academic LOR. Even though the academic LOR is from 2 different people from the same university the CONTENT is the same. ( The only thing different is the name of the professors, the subject that the professor taught me and of courses their respective department and signature)  \nWill this mistake cost me? Can I rectify it, as the application has already been submitted? Any advice/thoughts or suggestions?  \nThank you in advance :)",

But here I go…\n\nI was recently recommended for dismissal from my grad PA Program due to academic dishonesty. It was my first offense due to a  mental health crisis, but the facility believed otherwise. I didn’t want to blame my mental health so I was forthcoming with what happened and attempted to appeal, which I lost.\n\nBeing a PA and working in healthcare is my life’s dream. I worked incredibly hard to get into my program, held a leadership position and even was awarded a national scholarship. I was desperate and in a lot of distress. I had a lapse of judgement and made a horrible irreversible decision. Despite getting therapy and medication through it, I still had a a major depressive episode and a manic episode. I really made a huge mistake and was remorseful and ashamed of myself.\n\nI don’t know what to do next. An academic integrity mark on my records feels like it would bar me from any other medical/healthcare related programs. I feel lost and hopeless that I killed my own dreams and really f*cked my life up. I had everything going for me and here I am, getting kicked out of school.\n\nCan one even recover from this? How? How can I move forward when my dreams are crushed. And my chances for other opportunities may be diminished by one mistake I made.\n\nI’m trying so hard not to give up because again, healthcare is everything to me. I would appreciate any guidance or help.",

I had too many failed short-term relationships throughout my college life, and I am tired of it since I want a long-term healthy relationship leading up to marriage.\n\nMy parents kept telling me to be practical about my goals, and I still struggled with making difficult decisions. However, I have read stories by Ph.D. people who got married during their Ph.D. program and graduated with flying colors, which is something I am willing to go through in that scenario.\n\nSome people have recommended pursuing a Master's degree before going for a Ph.D., which I am also willing to go through. However, I am concerned about losing my opportunity to pursue a Ph.D. when I start a family. I want to avoid ending up like my parents, who regretfully lost their chance to pursue a Ph.D.\n\nAny actual astrophysicist who had that experience as I am currently going through, please suggest what steps have worked for you and, hopefully, could help me make the right decision for all the things I want in life to meet my goals.",

It is a very appealing job to me because I am not interested in teaching at all, so a standard tenure-track job does not suit me. However, the institute does not grant PhD degrees and does not have students except for visiting PhDs from other institutions.\n\nDoes anyone have any experience with this kind of a job? I am particularly curious about:\n\n1. How difficult is it to actually run a research group without students? My research is theoretical (math) so the lack of students to run experiments is not an issue, but I'm just not sure if it's really possible to have a proper \"group\" like this. I would receive generous funding to hire postdocs, but I can't imagine high-level postdocs being attracted to a group led by a fresh PI who doesn't even have students.\n2. The position is not tenured, and the upper limit of the length of employment is 8 years. I expect that not having PhD students of my own would make it difficult to move to a senior position at a university after this job. Would my academic career prospects be essentially limited to similar research institutes? (I could try to work with external PhDs to mitigate this.)\n\nAny other thoughts and experiences are appreciated.",

Quite a lot of the feedback was sound. \n\nImmediately on the feedback there were serious issues. \n\n-one marker stated my abstract was missing from the paper. It wasn’t. I got confirmation later that the diss had an abstract because my first instinct was that some upload error occurred and the abstract had been deleted\n\n-Stated an image that would be useful was not in the paper. It was \n\n-The feedback stated I should have used smaller image sizes to address a problem and that I didn’t address why. I did use smaller images, and stated why.I did in detail, like a lot of detail. It was not a statement of opinion but stated that something was not in my paper when it was.  The reader had missed the paragraphs completely. \n\n-Feedback stated factually that a certain coding language was not used for data science, which is completely wrong. The language was Python. \n\n- What bothered me most was feedback stating that I needed to thank my advisors and “those who have helped you” I chose not to thank anyone but my family, and that was intentional. My advising team were physically gone the last month of my dissertation. They were gone periodically throughout the summer writing period. I had one meeting with one of them to discuss and pick up some material. I have not physically seen my other advisor or emailed them in probably 6+ months. Regardless if I did or did not thank them, the feedback to me implied that if I had written a thank you I would have received a higher mark, that the lack of a thank you was a negative. \n\nBasically does anyone have any advice on a grade appeal? Obviously them stating the abstract was missing along with the image and paragraph overlook were pretty obvious for an appeal, but the comment on my acknowledgements really really irked me. It’s technically an opinion so I can’t appeal it but there is just no way that I should be marked down for thanking my family and not my advisors.",

The deadline for the internship application is now around the corner, so I emailed one of the postdocs in his lab that mentored me and asked if he could perhaps mention in person to him that I emailed him about something important.  \n\nWell, now I just learned that, for whatever reason, my PI has simply been ignoring my request, despite me outlining in the email that the due date is near and I need to at least know if he is unable to write it in time so that I have time to ask someone else instead.\n\nThankfully, the grad students and postdocs at my lab were incredibly helpful and supportive, so some of the postdocs who mentored me offered to write me a letter of recommendation instead. I am immensely appreciative of this offer, but my only concern is it is possible that it may reflect poorly on me if the postdocs are writing letters of recommendation on my behalf rather than the PI himself?

Unfortunately, all the guidelines are very brief and leave me with a lot of questions.\n\nMore specifically, for the essay part, the submission site states only the following: \"Essay (max 5 pages)\". This is very different from all European applications that I've submitted, where we have very specific style guidelines and templates. And hence my concern is about the expected formatting of the essay. \n\nFrom brief searching and general experience, it seems that the American style prefers larger line spacings (*e.g.* 1.5 or 2 line instead of single spacing) and a specific font (Times New Roman 12pt?). Of course, this significantly affects the amount of information that I can provide in the essay, and I am sure that there is a clear implicit expectation of the style so that all applicants provide a similar amount of details. Therefore comes my question - should I specifically aim to make the text with larger spacings, and hence less content, or would it be alright to use single spacing with not necessarily Times New Roman as a font?\n\nAny other recommendations that might not be obvious from a European perspective are also welcome.\n\nThanks",

        "text": " \n\nI've been finishing up my graduate applications for Fall 2023 and I was lucky enough to have a few professors offer to meet with me over Zoom. This university in particular recommends that prospective students reach out to potential advisors to talk about doing research and supporting applications.\n\nI've done undergraduate research for a majority of the time that I was in undergrad, roughly 3 years out of 4. While I'm not 100% sure of the exact projects that I would to do research on, I still have a good grasp and one of my top lab choices does very similar research to what I am interested in.\n\nEven with all of that in mind, I am still feeling very intimidated and nervous. What are professors usually looking for in these meetings and what should I expect? To what degree should I come prepared? For most of these meetings, especially the one with the professor whose research interests align fairly well with mine, I've prepared to discuss their recent publications, as well as ask questions related to them and their lab.\n\nOverall I'm fairly nervous, but I would like to present myself as a potential student who is eager to learn and do research in the lab. I'm just unsure of how to go about these meetings and what to expect, such as what questions that I'll be asked, and what questions that I should ask them.",

But more often than not when there's a few seconds of silence the it always ends up with them leaving.\n\nI only get along quite well with others if we share not only the field we're working on, but also sites where we do fieldwork/collect our data because the conversation tends to be about our informants, our fieldwork sites, etc.\n\nWould a more experienced scholar share their advice on this aspect?
