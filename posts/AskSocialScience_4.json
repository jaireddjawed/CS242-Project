        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskSocialScience/comments/z5cp3y/what_named_organizational_and_sociological/",
        "text": "* In *The Castle*, a man tries to enter a village, but finds that he needs to get a residence permit -  he diligently follows the required Byzantine procedures to do so, finding one dead end after another. By the time he does end up being granted the permit, the person delivering it finds him dead of exposure.\n* In *The Trial,* a man is accused of *something,* it's not clear *what.* The charges and evidence are kept secret from him. The judicial process subjects him to a lengthy period of extreme uncertainty and stress - as well as ruinous expense. He is treated by all as if presumed guilty. His reputation is shot, he loses his job and his support network. He is eventually condemned and swiftly executed with no chance for appeal.\n\nThe story's fantastical transformation into \"a massive vermin\" is not treated literally. A man turning into a \"monster\" overnight, while demonstrably retaining identity and intelligence, would be a scientific and medical wonder, garner immense public attention, and present plenty of income opportunities - if only as a circus \"freak\". \n\nFor all practical purposes, it's treated like a *health crisis* - either a physical, disfiguring disability or a sudden manifestation of acute depression/burnout. The most important problem it causes is, it makes Gregor Samsa unfit for work. The family act extremely resentful, contemptuous, and disrespectful to him because he is the only breadwinner in the household - the parents are too old to work, the sister is too young to marry. Gregor can no longer make money to support them - starting with making rent! Eventually, the father fatally injures Gregor and none of them gives him any healthcare (not that they'd know how), leading to a protracted but inevitable death.\n\nThe story ends with them being hopeful for the future upon his death, because now that he's gone, along with the stigma of his existence, it also happens that the sister is now old enough to marry. As such, they can find a new breadwinner to support them.\n\nThis seems to suggest that the parents don't have a pension to rely on, and Gregor doesn't have any \"unemployment insurance\" or any other sort of safety net in case he gets sick - and, simultaneously, they don't have a community support system either. I'm curious about how societies such as turn-of-the-century Austro-Hungarian empire handled such failure states of the \"single breadwinner\" model.",

        "text": "Ok so basically some friends and me are arguing over this philosophy topic everytime we see each other and we can't get up with an agreement.\n\nSo the topic is about our consciousness and our subconscio. I will refer consciouness as CN and SC for subconscio for the remaining threat. \n\nSo the example we can't figure our head around is pretty simple and stupid but in my opinion has a deeper/wider meaning behind it. \nI recently read Martin heidegger's book about his take on CN and SC and kind of agree with most of his points.\n\nBut enough talking around here is the example. Imagining a person is totally straight. Can this same person decide for himself that he wants to be homosexuel all of a sudden without having any interest in such a relation before? \n\nI know I know stupid example but I think it's kind of interesting on a wider scale. The question that brings up is can you willingly by thinking about it put a thought from your CN in your SC. Can you trick yourself by persuading your own SC willingly?\n\nThe definition about our CN and SC and there range is a hard topic to discuss as every philisopher in history has their own thesis about it. \n\nWe can put this example into a simpler relation. If I willingly want to get to sleep earlier and proceed doing so every night my body will earlier or later adept to that circle and I will get sleepier earlier. So I willingly changed my SC into putting a thought in my CN over and over again. \n\nIf that works on a small scale like that. Does it work on a larger scale aswell? \n\nTo get back to my first example. It's not the biggest thought in human history I just think it interesting thinking about being able to trick our SC to want something even though we didn't want it in the first place - manipulating our own thinking of life on our own. \n\nClosing words:\nWe get manipulated by the media or other people everyday. Either on a big or small topic about our life. But that all happens unwillingly. So to sum up this threat:\nCan you willingly change your subconscio? \n\nMaybe I am totally wrong in this topic and stupid. I didn't study philosophy - just enjoy reading old philosophers and discussing about topics like this. \nLooking forward to hear your opions on this or to make me look like a coward ;) \n\nCheers,",

We can even see such concerns in mythology, ie Achilles om Skyros.\n\nAre these examples reflective of moments in time, or is this a near constant concern? My own hypothesis is that since maleness is often tied to status, then there is a preoccupation with the definitions of it. As such, accusations of feminity or homosexuality are ready insults in these cultures, and become self-reinforcing. \n\n\n\nUSA in the 1950s:  https://muse.jhu.edu/article/197476\n\nJapan in the 1800-1900s: https://www.jstor.org/stable/4126775\n\n USA in the 1800s:   Changing ideal  of manhood in  late-nineteenth  century America Changing ideal  of manhood in  late-nineteenth  century America John Robert Van Slyke The University of Montana :\n\n\"Perhaps no one embodied this turn toward masculinity better than Teddy Roosevelt.

A fair amount of people online are describing how this is low compared to the murder rates of the general public and thus proves that trans people are one of the safest demographics in terms of murder rates. I’m assuming this is an misleading interpretation of the article’s info, but I’d like to hear from you all. Are trans people relatively safer when it comes to murder rates and are the conclusions people are drawing from this article accurate?",

        "text": "Obviously different people get into relationships for different reasons. For some people I've met I know that they get into a relationship or become interested in someone because they match well with eachother. Be it common interests, similar world view, compatible (but not necessarily similar) personalities or usually a mix of those reasons and more. This is a pretty common to what I can see.\n\nHowever, I've started noticing more and more that another common thing is people do is developed feelings or getting into relationships for \"social reasons\". If someone has a better term, feel free to suggest it.\n\nI put social reasons in quotation marks because I'm not sure if that's the right way to put it. What I mean is people who's romantic ideas seem to be influenced by things around them like things people around them do, popular trends, current celebrities, mostly current topics in pop culture. Most of this has to do with social stuff. The words \"social reasons\" might not be the best way to put it, but I can't think of better terminology so I'll use that.\n\n\nI don't really understand why someone would do this, I'll go by each thing.\n\n\nThings people around them do:\nWhy base your decisions off of someone else? You could take inspiration or advice/wisdom from someone else. It's a very good idea to do so, leaning from others is great. But the people I'm talking about just do the same thing as another person. Instead of learning from them. It's like \"person x dates that type, so will I\" instead of \"person x choses partners based off categories 1,2 &amp; 3, I like that but I'll change category 2 for me\".\n\n\nPopular trends:\nThis one isn't as common as the above one, and makes a little more sense. An example is \"person y doesn't like thing, therefore don't socialise with them or date them\". I remember that from being a teenager, and I certainly don't see nearly as much of it with people my age now, but I still do a bit. But it's less strict, more like\"having a preference for people with similar interests\" rather than \"not socialising with people who have different interests\". So I mostly of get this one, but sometimes it's still weird. Like a person who didn't want to date someone because they didn't like a certain film/tv thing, or a person who doesn't like a aport, or a person who dates based off of clothing style. I can perhaps understand the clothing and sports ones as fashion and sport are hobbies of these person, but it still seems strict. I get wanting a partner with similar interests, but some people seem too strict with it.\n\n\nCurrent celebrities:\nWhy do people want to or not want to date someone based off of their similarity to \"the Sherlock/Dr. Strange actor\" or \" Ariana Grande\" or whomever? You don't know the celeb, only what you see. Why compare people to that? It makes no sense that when \"X\" celeb becomes popular, that's what you become interested in. Why are some people's romantic ideas influenced by a celeb or the character they play.\n\n\nI don't really get this, could someone please explain it to me? Why let socially popular things, either in your social circle or in popculture, influence something like relationship wants/requirements? Relationships are different depending on the individuals in it, why be influenced by \"social reasons\"?",

This question occured to me while I was looking at Buddhism which is generally considered one of the major religions but does not seem to fit the theme of other major religions about god/s and stuff. And this opened a whole new question because philosphies also try to explain our relationship with reality without using god motive, yet they are something completely different, so where do we draw the line between Philosophy and religion?",

This is even more true when thinking about traveling to countries like China or Japan or India, where you'd need to learn a bit before even traveling there to make sure you're not being offensive and respecting their culture.\n\nSo this got me wondering: what culture or society uses up the most mental space to just go by in a day? Out of all the thoughts one has in a day, what culture or society uses up most of those thoughts when making decisions, and why or what makes that culture unique?",

        "text": "Hi all! I'm in my first semester of an Applied Anthropology MA program, giving my final seminar facilitation of the semester this coming Monday. In true \"boss fight\" fashion, this last one includes Bourdieu. I'll have to teach the class with my very limited understanding, so I'm hoping to get some other perspectives. I'm familiar with his more frequently cited concepts like Practice and Habitus, but we've been assigned this chapter, \"Objectification Objectified,\" which has very few outside resources available to help give context and explain.\n\nAll I really know about structuralism and structural linguistics is it's based on the idea of finding the \"source code\" structure underlying human systems of thought and behavior, focusing on this structure rather than the particulars of certain instances. I think my main issues are difficulty with the language/translation of the work of course, but also limited context on Saussure and structuralism. \n\nHere is my rough understanding of this chapter so far:\n\nBourdieu is critiquing objectivism, a perspective that vies language as a system removed from individual instances of speech and communication—a structure that exists in a snapshot in time (viewed synchronically) with no regard for the fact the speech is a prerequisite for the development of language systems, and no regard for the individuals using actual speech. Bourdieu critiques the formal, academic \"scholastic\" stance required to take this perspective, saying it places the observer in an outsider position that removes them from the actual use of speech, in an attempt to create an \"ahistorical essence.\" Anthropology and particularly structuralist anthropology engages in a similarly problematic practice in observing social practices, removing the observer from everyday ways of knowing and acting. In this focus on cognitive structure, it misses the practical purposes and everyday reality of social life. In other words, it fails to acknowledge the role of the observer in turning real social practices into an object of academic study. \n\nThis feels vague. I'd like to have more, and to be able to explain it in more detail, maybe applying it to some examples. Am I on the right track at all? Can anyone explain objectivism in this context? \n\nThank you!!!",
