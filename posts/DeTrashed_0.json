        "text": "The reason why people throw away perfectly good clothes is simply because it's the easy thing to do. I had a chat with a big shot at Waste Management who confirmed this. It's too much of a hassle for folks to spend hours listing their clothes on resale platforms, lugging heavy bags to the post office, or heading to thrift stores and waiting in line. They just want the clothes gone from their homes ASAP.\n\nThat's where my startup, Brie, comes in. We're launching soon and folks can select a charity they care about and schedule a pick-up. Once the items sell, the charity they chose gets paid and they also receive a tax deduction. Pretty sweet, huh?\n\nIf you're interested, you can join the waitlist at http://brie-waitlist.carrd.co.\n\nThat's where my startup, Brie, comes in.
