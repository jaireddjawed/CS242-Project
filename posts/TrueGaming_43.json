        "author": "DirtySyko",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/7vlqkc/thoughts_on_limited_timed_content_in_games/",
        "text": "I've seen numerous topics involving loot crates, micro transactions, season passes, and early access games, but I don't often see the topic of limited timed content brought up and discussed. Content like this primarily revolves around online games, but it has started appearing in single player games as well, (Correct me if I'm wrong, I haven't played the game, but from my understanding the latest Hitman game has featured content that is no longer accessible and will not return in the future.) What are your thoughts on content in games that is only available for a limited time and once it's gone there's a high possibility it won't return?\n\nI play a lot of Blizzard games and they are notorious for this tactic. Each month Hearthstone has a card back to earn, if you miss out you'll never receive it. Heroes of the Storm, Overwatch, and Diablo 3 all have seasons with exclusive rewards, get them now or never. WoW, the guiltiest of them all to do this, has had *thousands* of things removed from the game. An MMO is supposed to be ever evolving, so sometimes it makes sense, but there is still plenty of content featured for only a limited time and then removed.\n\nPersonally, systems like this have turned me off from playing some games. It feels like a tactic developers use to create that FOMO sensation and keep players from taking breaks from playing their games. I love it when developers continue to create new content for their games, but I want to feel rewarded for my time invested, I don't want to feel like a hostage to the game and that if I don't play it I will regret it later. It might seem like a silly prospect to some people, but I believe there's a lot of gamers who are negatively affected by systems like this. I also think it can be daunting and turn off new players from a game. \n\nI love collecting things, achievement hunting, and grinding out rewards in games, but anytime I'm curious about trying a new game that has been out for a while and come to find out it is full of content no longer available, I'm immediately turned away from it. I like the idea of being new to a game and seeing a veteran who has something that looks awesome, and I want it, so I look up online on how to achieve it and find this instead: \"This item has been removed from game.\" That was one of my great experiences first playing WoW. I started playing WoW a year after release, so I've experienced a great deal of content, but one of fondest earliest memories was seeing high level people with cool gear or mounts I hadn't obtained yet. I still had every opportunity to get them myself, and it gave me the motivation to keep playing and earn them. Now when you log on WoW you see so many mounts, armor sets, weapons, titles, etc. that it's overwhelming, and if you want to hunt them down and earn them yourself there's a good chance it's no longer obtainable.\n\nContent like this also brings about a sense of entitlement and superiority. When this subject is brought up about some specific item in a game I've seen the discussion unravel into toxicity where a player feels like they deserve something and nobody else should have it. It hurts the community of the game and, once again, creates a daunting and overwhelming feeling for new players.\n\nLimited timed content has it's place in gaming. It brings incentive to players and gives them a reward they can be proud of. But, I think games are completely over doing it right now and taking the fun away from getting those rewards. Earning a card back in Hearthstone each month isn't rewarding, it's exceptionally easy to do, so it ends up just feeling like you are forced to get on and play even when you aren't in the mood. On the other hand WoW had a 10th anniversary event where they brought back a raid and let players go through and experience content a lot of people probably never had, as well as earning yourself an extremely cool mount for doing so. If you weren't playing WoW at the time and missed the event, you missed the mount, but they still allow you to receive it another way, albeit a fairly expensive way using a system called the Black Auction House which has players bid on items for a lot of gold. I'm OK with a system like this, I think it's fair and rewarding. I don't feel entitled to my mount, or any of my other items I own in WoW that have been removed, and I think others should have a chance to earn them. It might not be the same way I did, it might even be more difficult, but at least they have the chance. Ultimately, I want more systems like that. I think removing content from games is a negative experience for everyone, and developers should allow rewards to be earned in different ways if the content is no longer relevant. What are your thoughts?",

        "text": "I finally got around to playing Witcher 3 these past couple weeks. Nearly done with the epilogue. While I have definitely enjoyed the game, I'm trying to figure out why it didn't quite click with me, the way it has with so many.\n\nOne element of W3 I want to discuss, is the way the plot is revealed. Geralt is essentially playing a detective throughout the story, retracing Ciri's steps, cutting to flashbacks, etc. A medieval film-noir almost. **The game's main events are being revealed to you, rather than created by you.** This has the effect of a netflix-binge, more than what I expect from a game. Compare this to Dragon Age Inquisition, while still mostly linear, the choices the player makes change and actively create the world you are playing e.g. choosing templars vs mages, companions flirting with or leaving your party.\n\nNow you might say the W3 is not intended to be malleable, Geralt is Geralt, has his own backstory and ways. I actually enjoyed this; It's fun to see beyond the gruff exterior with certain character interactions. But none of the important characters really do anything to make me care about them. Everyone in Novigrad basically: Dandelion, Zoltan, Triss. Everything is told from this cliffhanger angle of \"wait, come help me out and then I'll tell you about Ciri, just one more thing, okay so Ciri...\" which I feel is kind of cheap storytelling, and mostly depends on associations from the previous games.\n\nEssentially, I want to ask fans of the game, open world aside, **do you feel that the passive nature of the story-telling in W3 takes away player-agency? Does this matter to you?**\n\n**What characters were you invested in &amp; who seemed mostly obligatory? Was the development of Geralt / Ciri the main priority?**\n\n\n\n\n ",

        "text": "Disclaimer: Ok I know that's a very controversial topic and I'm not going to tell that there should be more male video game characters than female, I just wish that there would be more often a choice to choose from, especially because many of these games I will list are featuring silent protagonists with no real excuse why they should be exclusively female. I hope you are open to discussion I don't want to forbid anything to anyone or something you might think.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI miss that feeling, where I can identify with my game character, which is something I get from playing many retro games from before. \nI know you play just an avatar, a bunch of pixels (or polygons) which tries to resemble something like a human. But I'm much more deeply involved when the character is as close as possible from its traits to me, especially when he/she's silent. \nSomeone like \"Volgarr\" from \"Volgarr the Viking\", may not look like me (not even closest) but he portrays somehing I wish I could be, its a male power fantasy. \nMany games from the 90s were featuring such characters and you know what? I think it was great.\n\nMany people do play videogames to play as someone they can't be in real life or try to relate to their favorite characters. I am someone who gets fast immersed by playing video games I have fun imagining to be the same character I do play for the time, even when he has dialouges I can't agree sometimes.\n\nWell... when I play a female character it's a little bit different, because I'm a male myself I can't really get into my character without getting an uncanny feeling I guess it sounds weird, but I don't get that 'click' when my character is female. I'm feeling like a creep I'm not into at imagining how I would be and act as a woman. (believe me it would be frightening)\n\nSo I understand that there were to many games in the past, where you could only play as a male character, I'm sure many of the few women who were playing videogames back in the days were pretty much turned off by the lack of a female figure of identification. It's ok sometimes, I'm no sexist If the game is good I play also as a female character, diversity is fine.\n\nBut lately I got the feeling that the Balance is now flipping to the other side, more and more game feature only female characters, especially on the indie sector. \nAAA games are not of my interest anymore, but even there, female character are going to get the upper hand. \nOn the indie game sector it's a whole other level, all the games I played lately and I'm looking forward featuring only female characters, the amount is getting pretty out of hand. \n\nI don't know if I have just \"bad luck\" and the games I do interest for are all an exception but I'm at a point where I think that a one sided trend is evolving.\n\nHere is a list of games I have played shortly and I'm about to look forward:\n\nI played:\n\n- Celeste,\n- Iconoclasts,\n- A Hat in Time,\n- The Next Penelope,\n- Jotun,\n- Sundered,\n- Heroines Quest\n- Steamworld Dig 2\n- 20xx\n- CrossCode\n- Blossom Tales\n- Cally's Cave\n\nI look forward to:\n\n- Bloodstained,\n- Dandara,\n- Eitr,\n- Yandere Simulator (ok I can understand why you can only play a female in this game BUT, the focus on the side characters is also to much on the female side)\n- Battle Princess Madelyn\n- Catmaze\n- Some Cyberpunk Rouglike Game where you play an Angel (I don't know the name anymore)\n- probably more I forgot\n\nThey are almost all fairly new games, which I choose to exemplify my tiny complaint. \n\nI know there are games where its important to play as female character, like Bayonetta, if it goes with the artistic vision, then I have no problem, but I wouldn't count that, to these games on the list. \n\nI feel left off a bit. It's nothing I'm frightend of, boldly spoken, it's just a little nuisance, but I wish that much more of these games would let me a choice, which gender I would like to play. \n\nJust for more immersion and possibilites to identify with. Especially because most of these games are still played mainly by men, I know it's pitty, but that's how it is. \nSo it's a lot more unreasonable for me why the trend is going more and more to (only) female main characters while the general audience is still male.\n\nAt last two good examples of games who handled the identification problem masterly: Undertale and Hyperlight Drifter, where the sex of your character was intentionally keeped in vain, so they can be anything you think of yourself. It's a win-win for both sides. (and evertyhing besides)\n\nSo I hope some of you can understand my viewpoint, I'm a little bit worried that some people may feel offended, but that's really not my intention I just think that's a topic which is worth discussing, especially with a view on the retrospective.\n\nSo please, be nice.\n\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "First of all, let me qualify that I have no issue with easier difficulty modes in games, and they address many player's desires and needs.\n\nRecently I replayed three games on their hardest difficulty settings: Dragon Age: Inquisition, Thief (2014) and The Witcher 3. One of the things I immediately noticed with DAI and TW is that the core combat became much more \"alive\" - skills I had once ignored became vital, and the use of items, positioning and planning became necessary for success. In particular with TW, I began to see how the oft-maligned combat system was designed around preparation and use of diverse items and skills- the hack and slash button mashing stopped working at this level.\n\nLikewise with Thief, setting the game to Master and disabling focus mode brought it more in line with the originals, requiring constant problem solving as integral to the main gameplay loop. I still think this game is better than the panning it received (life long Looking Glass fan).\n\nAs a result I find myself having the courage to start games at more challenging difficulties because it's the challenge that interests me most.\n\nHow do we solve this problem? Many games are quite 'gimped' on standard difficulty, because the lack of challenge means the player occupies a passive, backseat role and in my opinion, alienates them from the game and causes them to not only overlook gameplay mechanics but also disengage from the narrative. You pay way more attention to, and savor, a cutscene that took time and effort to reach. Yet on the other hand, we should support gamers who are more interested in the narrative, or who might be disabled or new to a genre as well.\n\nDark Souls solved this problem in a somewhat elegant fashion: summoning. Rather than present users with a difficulty option at the start (before they even know how hard the game is), it makes available the ability to navigate challenging parts of the game by introducing, gradually, the ability to seek assistance. The difficulty scaling is weaved into the game and even its narrative, and the player can choose when they need to 'tap out' *after* the full extent of the challenge is revealed.\n\nAs for professional critics - they have deadlines. I can't imagine myself wanting to jump into the hardest difficulty of a 100 hr plus adventure with an editor tapping her watch at me either. But fundamentally, I think we miss out on so much of the potential of many games by not accepting the challenge.",

        "text": "With the advent of the Nintendo Switch and open world releases of Zelda breath of the wild and Super mario odyssey, gamers have been treated to large worlds with grand multitudes of samey goals and challenges.\n\nBethesda's Elder scrolls Daggerfall had a similar approach back in 1996 utilizing a procedural generation technique in order to spawn generally fleshed out templates throughout perhaps the largest game world to this day.\n\nAn effort has been underway to bring the [freeware release](https://elderscrolls.bethesda.net/en/daggerfall?) of daggerfall into the [unity game engine](https://youtu.be/_53ewC7wsz8?t=37s) by a [group of talented modders](http://www.dfworkshop.net). That had me thinking about the large expanse of potential activities these games share in common, and how the style seems to suit the switches' on the go aspect that players really adore it for.\n\nBethesda could stand to really capitalize on a modern portable version of the second elder scrolls game, and perhaps even looking into hiring the talent responsible for this already more enticing version of the game. I'm sure players would really enjoy a seemingly never ending roleplaying adventure game on the go and perhaps with some motion controls that complement the original's swinging the weapon gameplay mechanic.\n\nTurning my attention back on Nintendo I see real opportunity in the crossover of their gaming franchises. We've already gotten to experience a unique brawler and kart racing games, in addition to a myriad of sports games. I would be interested in seeing the company take their Super mario series and combining it with Zelda.\n\nThe floatiness in their newest releases really makes me wonder about what it would be like to play Zelda with the spectacularly reactive movement demonstrated in Mario. I dug up an old post of mine on this idea and switched it up a bit for you to read below if you're interested.\n\n&gt;[The Legend of Peach: Super Mario Adventure](https://www.reddit.com/r/nintendo/comments/5ucl7h/if_you_were_in_charge_of_the_design_the_next/)\n\n&gt;Peach is kidnapped by Bowser once again, there's a Grandstar that preserves the land keeping it safe. That macguffin is split into pieces and spread across the Mushroom kingdom causing the world to stretch apart, with temple worlds gating further progress.\n\n&gt;Grandstar fragments can be retrieved from within temple worlds lying on the border of the land aberrations, each one recovered will repair the corresponding portion of land in the surrounding location. Every temple world will resemble levels akin to Super mario 64, complete with various stars and a boss key to be rewarded for various challenges .\n\n&gt;Each boss is a multi-stage set of challenges for the player's combat and maneuverment abilities developed as you play the game. Mario starts with a red colored tunic and red hood, his punch and crouch are replaced with sword swings and brandishing of a shield. Mario can show his stars to Sages scattered about the world to learn new combat and platforming skills, and even obtain new equipment.\n\n&gt;Faeries are now 1up mushrooms providing extra lives, shops can sell Mario an upgraded blue armored tunic with limited durability that halves damage and temporary sword upgrades. After completing a few levels Mario is then able to enlarge himself with regular mushrooms and shortly after that he's then able to shrink with poison mushrooms.\n\n&gt;The tanooki tunic allows Mario to glide through the air like the deku leaf, the fireflower tunic gives him the ability to fling fireballs at will and the cat tunic allows Mario to climb up short stints of wall or to follow places marked by claw marks all the way upward. These tunics open up new routes and possible collectibles if you were to backtrack to previous areas and levels.\n\n&gt;A secret trading sequence ends with Mario having acquired all parts and pieces of Toad's Starship or Mario's Odyssey, and Captain Toad fully repairing it. With the ship Mario can swiftly move across the Mushroom Kingdom and reach out of the way areas such as the tops of mountains, islands, and a bonus level in the clouds.\n\n&gt;The Mushroom Kingdom reforms after fully acquiring the pieces of the Grandstar forging the path to Bowser. This final boss battle revolves around enlarging to swat Bowser and his kin out of the sky and proceeding to shrink down and enter their vehicles. Inside are difficult challenges that are overcame in order to disable them.\n\n&gt;Bowser makes a final gambit of enlarging himself and heading off to destroy the Mushroom Kingdom, Godzilla style. This climatic battle occurs with the inhabitants of the Mushroom kingdom cheering on Mario whilst hauling powerful explosives into place for the surreal reenactment of Super Mario 64's Bowser boss battles, with the entirety of the Kingdom underfoot.\n\n&gt;Stopping Bowser the first time unlocks a second quest playable as Luigi with more difficultly designed levels on top of the game world being completely reversed and Dry Bowser serving in the final faceoff with Luigi.\n\nNot as elaborate but neat none the less I found an old post on ask reddit asking what [Pokemon Stop would be about](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/4sjova/what_would_pokemon_stop_be_about/) (as opposed to Pokemon Go of course):\n\n&gt;You arrange protests and sabotage pokeball factories. You beat up trainers and set poke'man free. You lead a revolt to free pokemon all over the world. Then they promptly enslave humanity and build hand thrown cubes that capture humans. They breed humans and cock fight them in exchange for... ~~whatever that gameboy game currency is.~~ reddit karma\n\nBetween the big names of Nintendo and Bethesda and their much beloved gaming series, there's tons of possibilities in remaking old games for a portable outing or mashing together gaming staples into brand new spin off series.\n\nI was inspired to make this anomalous post by one in here about how Skate and the old Tony Hawk video games were really immersive games to just chill around in with friends. I would link to it but I cannot find it within several pages back which is when I remembered to have seen it.\n\nCertain gaming genres are just awaiting their opportunities to be reinvigorated and brought to the portable market afforded by the Nintendo Switch. Not just skating games that gamers have been craving, there's also desire for cooperative wave defense games that niche Call of duty gameplay mode Zombies might just fill before too long.\n\nMaybe even a reemergence of song rhythm games is in order as it matches up quite well with the casual nature of the Switches' portability and dare I say Lambo. Perhaps gamers might think constructing various limited supply cardboard guitars or even other instruments and personalizing them is right up their ally.\n\nThe possibilities of where the gaming industry can go next are endless and exciting, but I've grown really tired of seasonal rehashes of different series. I want to see certain gaming trends subverted and a resurgence in creative original designs.\n\nMostly I specifically want to see design improvements built upon instead of seemingly being lost every generation of consoles. The original Thief had an assortment of various arrow types not too unlike Zelda, however they were beyond a fire, ice or light, it had rope arrows that allowed you to climb up toward the rafters sometimes.\n\nI can imagine with a very reactive physics engine like the one found in breath of the wild that zip lining and grappling hooks would be an absolute joy in experimenting with in achieving goals. That's one thing that declined in Elder scrolls releases that shined out in many of Nintendos'.\n\nNintendo made goofing off and toying around with their tools in their worlds a blast in itself. Arena and Daggerfall had that going on in spades, even Morrowind one of my favorite games of all time had ridiculous freedom in the spell creation systems and the free roaming open world with zilch for hand holding.\n\nPerhaps the hand holding is much more inviting these days, turning the hardcore rpg experience into something more casually enjoyable would benefit everyone now. Fallout 4 is accredited as a great game but an awful Fallout game due to its focus on fresh gameplay mechanics in lieu of attending to the lore of that unique universe and setting.\n\nButchering the lore of each gaming series doesn't amount to much more than splitting and alienating the fan bases. A proper synthesis of gameplay mechanics and narrative can be incredibly immersive and incentivise players to continue.\n\nSuspense can be maintained by setting up questions that the audience hopes to get an answer to while delaying the answers, maintaining their interest and keeping them guessing. It seems to me that newer AAA titles only seem to do one or the other, either having a good story or having enjoyable cycles for the players.\n\nSuch gameplay mechanics could be fleshed out within new ip where even more fresh mechanics could service that style. Imagine if settlements you construct and multiple player's game worlds could synchronize between Switches and sieges could be thwarted cooperatively. How about quest lines refencing each player's friends and acquaintances and they could be sought after in finishing them.\n\nBeyond all those interesting possibilities in each series, this all converges in on Nintendo's position in online infrastructure, their most heavily criticized subject matter. They have the habit of demonstrating crazy unique styles of game only to abandon them immediately after.\n\nThey've tried out what asymmetrical multiplayer could amount to however their online service has been at an impasse for as long as they've been around. My dreams of the Wii U's Nintendo land being a massive online party game are presently dashed, any of their niche experiences are all awaiting online interconnectivity.\n\nWho just wants to see a kart racer with an adventure mode? Diddy Kong Racing 2, Nintendo kart or even just Mario kart 9, the title matters the least there's simply no video games that fill the void left in the original Diddy kong racing's absence.\n\nThe ultimate potential of the switch is that beloved styles of game play can now be brought about anywhere easily, and shared amongst those more casual players in the gaming crowd. It's the hardcore casual console created to appeal to any kind of gamer in the long run.",

In our first classes we were talking and chatting, just to know each other in the beggining of the school year. (I'm from Brazil, the classes are starting now).\n\nDuring the chat, almost all students with ages between 10 (and sometimes even 9) and 14 years said that they used to play videogames all the time, and loved to play GTA, Rainbow6 Siege, GTA, Fortnite, CS:GO and other said \"violent\" games. Note that by \"violent\" I mean games that were classified as recommended to an older age than theirs (or actually have violent elements).\n\nI grew up playing games similar and/or from these franchises, and was bombarded by the same kind of news you guys probably were too: *\"these games induce violence\", \"this kind of games will make you a sociopath\"*, etc, and we all know too that these kind of claims are false. They are indeed false, but it doesn't change the fact that *some kind* of content may be too graphical/impressive **(I don't know if that is the right word in english in this context)** for these ages, and impact their psychological development, not in a way that they'll play Just Cause and throw themselves of a flying plane, but in a way that they may be traumatized by the content itself, will have nightmares, that kind of thing (i'm not a psychologist, I don't know).\n\nAll the time during that conversation, I said to them that in no way I would tell them that these medias were forbidden, but I would like them to know **why** they were recommended to older ages. I've talked to the school psychologist and we're thinking in bringing some discussions to classroom about this.\n\nOnce again, I don't want to be a hypocrite with them, but I think it is my job as a teacher (specially teaching this subject) to talk about this with them.",

I love the way it's implemented in Black Ops 3 where you can pick a specific mission or a random mission and join people who are doing that mission even if the mission is in progress, and to host you just set your game to public. What are your opinions on matchmaking for coop games or the lack thereof?\n\nEdit: Guys in video gaming lingo co-op means PvE or players vs environment(monsters, AI, Computer enemies, ect.)

        "text": "Growing up as a gamer, I must have had the feeling of losing interest in a game halfway through one too many times, and the best way I've found to keep that feeling at bay and actually stand a decent chance of finishing a game is to tie up playing it into some kind of creative project that takes what I do in-game and adds something of my own to it.  This can range from making a map (as I'm doing with my Underrail run, which is well-suited for this), to doing a 'twice-told tale' playthrough where I explore the impact of making diametrically opposed gameplay choices (e.g. playing the Mass Effect games with a 100% Paragon and 100% Renegade at the same time and, for good measure, writing news headlines and abstracts that explore how those different actions are perceived), to head-to-head 'tournaments' between games of the same franchise, like when I broke the first 5 generations of the Pokemon games into stages (routes, caves, gyms) and kept track of the number of Pokemon catchable by each stage in each game, to in-character logs and diaries (sometimes as blog posts or just as a text file, but [in the case of Baldur's Gate](https://imgur.com/Yu1HkBC) I decided to do it with pen and paper, just as my character would).  Perhaps my most ambitious one, which is on ice currently and may remain so for years but which I intend to do at some point even if it's in the 2050s, involves writing a complete history of the Dragon Age from an in-universe PoV based on all the lore I discover while playing that's fit to print. I've made a very modest start on it, writing up the Noble Human origin story from Origins, but that's just the clod of snow at the very tip of the iceberg.  A few previews: [Foreword](https://imgur.com/f8CaZWX) [Part of Human origin](https://imgur.com/7qEY6Pa).\n\nSo... I know I'm weird.  What I'm interested in discovering is whether 'weird' in this case means 'in a minority of one' or 'There are dozens of us!  Dozens!'.",

But since one of my fans on my YouTube channel wanted to see me play it, I figured... ah, what the heck. For him, I'll give it a go.\n\nIt was one of the most charming games I've played in a very long while. Not kidding when I say I was enchanted by what I was playing. There were some bumps when it came to learning better the controls, but I absolutely ADORED the variety of portrait ghosts, especially Madame Clairvoya and Melody, and it felt... different. I'm generally used to platformers and party games and to a lesser extent, RPGs i.e Paper Mario. Granted, I wish Bowser wasn't the final boss for the umpteenth time, but I guess fighting him as a ghost was pretty cool. I feel like the point where I went from liking the game to loving it though was when I found this bud and kept coming back to water it. It really had me curious what would happen if I were to make sure it was okay. And the Blackout... HOO BOY that was terrifying. But it was also a real rush! Kinda like Star Fox Assault... anyone else have any experiences with Luigi's Mansion? Kinda curious.",

Where did she go?\"\n\nNow I think I can remember vaguely when I as a kid playing a version of Mortal Kombat with that kind of sword and Then it hit me SINDEL yes, I am aware that this is incorrect and I have no idea why she was the name that popped up in my head but she did. So fast forward I'm finally home and i get on the computer to do research only to find out that it wasn't Sindel from mortal combat but actually Ivy Valentine from Soul Caliber. So not only was my guess in correct but I also got the name of the game wrong too..SMH. And I'm a gamer this is sad af. But the main question that I wanted to ask you all was...\n\nDo you think that Ivy Valentine can somehow be added as aa main character in Mortal Kombat?\nIf So what would most likely be her purpose there? And what other details could you add that would probably be a valid reason at to why ? And if You DONT think she can be added in... I still wanna hear you guy's opinions though :) \n\n-From a very awkward 12th grader ;)\n",

I feel like if you want to make a sick game then that is all you need to do, and it doesnt always mean it need a story behind it. If you put enough lore content within a game it will help build that narrative. Other than the need to make a story, publishers seem to now feel the need to force the story in some games, making long drawnout, boring, and sometime awkard cutscenes unskippable. I think it sucks that as a consumer you buy a game and your somewhat force to partake in this part of the game that does s horrible job at making you want to play more.",

        "text": "I may be suffering from selection bias here, and I admittedly play far more Western RPGs/action/adventure/etc than JRPGs, but I don’t feel it’s unreasonable to say that I’ve noticed a definite pattern.\n\n\nBloodborne: Play this game co-operatively! Provided that you’ve acquired the hunter’s bell. And that you have adequate currency (Insight). And that you haven’t lost all your insight by dying while summoned or by summoning repeatedly, or by brainsucker. And that you’re within a few levels of one another, otherwise it won’t work. You’ll also get kicked after you kill a boss. Oh, you wanted to play with a specific person, like the friend in your party? Better set up a password before you go through the rigamarole. And you won’t progress through the game together, you’ll be dropped back into your own progression once you finish up in your friend’s game.\n\n\nDark Souls (I’ve only beaten the first and part of the second, please don’t eat me if 3 changes things up): Similarly obtuse, requiring arcane knowledge of esoteric, poorly explained items with limited range of use (e.g. boss battles).\n\n\nMonster Hunter World: Yep, there’s co-op! But you can’t play anything with a cutscene together unless you’ve played it before. Also, no free roam without a weird work-around. And you have to be close together in level.\n\n\nI’m sorry, I know my details on some of these are fuzzy, but honestly that’s because these systems are so obtuse as to be prohibitive. My best friend and I love co-op gaming together. Sometimes we live close geographically, sometimes we don’t, but we like to stay in touch by playing together. We at least *try* damn near every cooperative game that comes out. We had a fun stint with The Division when it released, played Destiny a lot, played D2 for like two weeks. Forza Horizon 3. Gears of War. Halo. Divinity: Original Sin. Diablo III. But we’re both grown adults with busy lives and we don’t always have time to play together. So when I picked up Bloodborne for a few hours a couple of times between our play sessions, I outleveled him and we couldn’t play that together anymore. I mean, Ghost Recon Wildlands, while not being particularly groundbreaking (and honestly one of the most tonally/morally repulsive games I’ve ever played) gets a fair bit of play from us because we can just load in and jam for a while with minimal fuss or having to worry about one of us being OP.\n\n\nI understand that BB, DS, and MH have delicate difficulty balancing and that some aspects of these systems are intended to maintain that balance. But I know I’ve played cooperative games that figured that out and kept things balanced. Even beyond that: if you want to keep a level range limit in place, that’s fine. But would it really be so hard/immersion breaking/whatever to add an ‘invite hunter’ menu item to Bloodborne and just let us co-op the game without all the hassle? Double the enemy health pools, do whatever you need to do to keep the game difficult.\n\n\n\nAm I right in seeing a trend here? Is this a cultural thing? Is it an immersion aspect that’s just lost on my overly pragmatic mindset? I’m interested to hear your thoughts!",

        "text": "I feel like I'm on crazy pills. Nothing I have seen has convinced me this is a game that is worth more than your average click through title on your steam queue, and yet you'd think with all the coverage that it's the second coming or something. It's a solid, retro style hard-as-balls indie platformer. Congratulations, now go stand in the room with the hundreds of other games that meet that description. Like, it's just so overdone and boring at this point. And it isn't even particularly fantastic retro art from the various videos I've seen. It's just... retro. Yay. Back in the early days of mainstream indie like Braid and Super Meat Boy having a retro indie platformer was a revelation. Now it's a tired, broken record that won't just stop fucking playing. And I get it, some people really like the aesthetic. I really enjoyed Luckslinger, with its retro aesthetic and soundtrack. And many other games pull off retro really well in my opinion. I see retro art in the form of Owlboy, Dead Cells, or even Terraria that I personally think is pretty okay in the scheme of things and works to advance itself further than simple \"retro\". And then I look at this in disdain and mild nausea as I try to understand why my main character doesn't have enough pixels to fill her smoothskin face with some eyes or something. It's got good color variance, I'll give it that at least I guess.\n\nOr maybe people like the gameplay of super hard platformers, okay fair enough. What about this game in particular is so fantastic? What differentiates it from This is The End, Super Meat Boy, VVVVVV, N++, (insert one of many \"I wanna be the guy\" clones here), and so on? What makes this a 10 on 10 game as compared to all the other games that came out last year. I can't say it's cause we've had a slow start for games in 2018 with Monster Hunter, Dragon Ball, and Iconoclasts. Is it cause we haven't had a hard indie platformer release in a while or even at least recently? I doubt that's the case but what do I know? I haven't paid much attention to the retro platformer indie scene in forever because again, the moment I want to I will have a wealth of options upon which to gorge myself. If that's the case then let me know.\n\nOk, it's got good controls, a (subjectively) good ost, and a relatable story of depression and sadness. Got it, but what makes it different? Why is it this game's controls are so praised but then games like Super Fancy Pants Adventure get ignored even though it has some of the smoothest platforming I've seen in a game? Or any other game that has tight controls? And do we really need to praise that? A game with bad controls is a bad game, seeing as how controls are THE SINGULAR INPUT METHOD a player has in order to play a game. A game that is not able to be interacted with is a poor example of a game (that sound you just heard was a Walking Simulator dying somewhere). How is it's (subjectively) good ost so good? Does it span a wide array of genres effectively, or does it embrace a few genres so lovingly that you can hear the music when you just think of the game? Is the soundtrack on the level of Hotline Miami(another good retro aesthetic btw) or Persona 5 or something? The story is relatable? As opposed to every other game that has a story of depression and sadness, somehow this one connects even deeper with everyone. In a primarily gameplay focused video game. Right. But fine, if it does it well then good for it and the devs on making yet another story about sad people doing things to be less sad and either becoming more or less sad in the process.\n\nWhy is it getting such good coverage? I mean fine, an indie darling is going to be an indie darling. But this is ridiculous. This game was on no radar that I know of and I like to think I have a good knowledge of notable releases coming out. But I'll assume it's because it's an \"undiscovered gem or something\" and just leave it at that. Or maybe I just happened to miss the memo, fine whatever. This level of praise however is usually reserved for games like, ohIdunno, Breath of the Wild? Or maybe PUBG? Let's get a little older, how about Mario 64 or Ocarina of Time. Really, everyone is telling me this game stands next to the greats like these games? It's so great and revolutionary that it deserves this level coverage and praise? Really?\n\nBut let's bring it all together. All of these things come together and we assume that everything is perfect and then yeah, for sure we have a 10/10, 5 fedoras out of 5, 2 big ole thumbs up video game. But nothing shows that. The art is boring, the OST is functional, the gameplay is barely different from any other 2d platformer, the controls make it playable, and the story is functional but samey when compared to any other sad person overcoming adversity story. Yet all of this mediocrity somehow combines itself into a damned chimera that is not only better than the sum of its parts, but is also a game upon which games should aspire to? And suddenly it's the best game ever (hyperbolic I know, but the 9/10s and 10/10s are essentially saying that their opinion is that this is one of the best games ever made)? I'm sorry, I just really do not understand this praise whatsoever and maybe this shows how disconnected I am from modern gaming culture as a whole. But nothing anywhere has convinced me that a game like this deserves anything more than some light praise and appreciation.\n\nAnd all this to say that the game seems fine. And that's what kinda gets me, it's a perfectly fine game. But hyperbole seems to have turned an okay indie game into a sudden masterpiece. You can call a rose beautiful, but when you're in a field of fucking flowers it's kinda hard to tell someone that this single rose is the most beautiful one you'll find. Especially when said rose looks exactly like all the other ones next to you. But please refute my points, I enjoy people taking apart arguments piecemeal just as I like doing so to others arguments. And I do understand at the end of the day this is all rather subjective but for the life of me I just don't get it and would appreciate a well thought out opinion that could at least show me a viewpoint that would see this game as so fantastic.\n\nEdit - Not even half an hour and this is already getting downvoted to hell and back again. So much for this place being a place for quality discussion of gaming. Attack my arguments, please. I want a discussion and I want to understand but keyboard warriors getting their jollies clicking the down arrow does nothing to help foster understanding or discussion. If you want to downvote then go for it, all the power to you but please at least respond with something that I can work with so I can understand why this game deserves so much praise.\n\nEdit 2: Why is it so bad to ask a person, on a subreddit that is fucking dedicated to analyzing and breaking down video games, to back up their claims of a game being good? Especially when this game in particular shares so many facets with other games that have done those things better and years before it? It is samey, and it shows none of the advancement of game design, graphics, or anything that we have seen since the beginning of the indie game scene. Gamers want games to be classified as art? Well start using your damn brain for once and be willing to discuss and back up why a game is good or great, why a game deserves to be considered a masterpiece, and why a game deserves to be remembered alongside the greats of other mediums. Or continue to use infantile language, insults, and barebones descriptions as the rest of \"art\" continues without you. When the majority of posts by people here were not willing to actually discuss the points I raise, it becomes clearer that gamers want the medium classified as art without the criticism and analysis that entails. Or maybe just the majority of people here don't have the level of critical thought required to look at something they love and be able to say \"I'm looking at this with a bias\" and actually see what people may see wrong with a game. And that's fine, but then gamers seem to be surprised when the majority of people still consider games to be fun distractions and toys when compared to other mediums. And I think they're wrong, but until the level of discussion and conversation around games changes to a level rivalling that of books, movies, or music it will continue to be seen as an immature and worthless medium. And hell, maybe they're right and games will continue to be a worthless medium that has nothing of value to give that can't already be obtained through other mediums. Whatever, fuck this sub, fuck these users, and most of all fuck me. I'm done.",

So I ultimately fail to see why console-exclusives would be anti-consumer since that's just the nature of consoles.  ",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/7thff7/sin_1998_a_review_and_some_thoughts/",
        "text": "Does anyone remember [SiN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SiN)? I first played it shortly after it came out, and I have fond memories of the singleplayer, and of playing LAN multiplayer with family. I played through the singleplayer all over again late last year, and it was a bit surreal to be honest, because it's the first time I've done so in almost 20 years.\n\nSiN was quite a unique game, and advanced for an FPS of the era. It has locational hit-detection (on both enemies and yourself), moments of downtime with stealth and puzzle solving, optional objectives with rewards for completing them (such as changes to subsequent levels, or new levels entirely), and plenty of destructible objects. It even has driveable vehicles! (Thankfully only for brief moments, because they control about as horribly as you'd expect.) The game also features fully interactive security consoles, which you mainly use for puzzle solving, deactivating turrets and opening doors. For an almost-linear FPS from 1998, the game had a surprising number of features and was really quite ambitious.\n\nReleased less than a month before Half-Life came along and revolutionised the genre, the game doesn't really have a lot in common with Half-Life, because SiN was the last of its kind, which is part of what I find so interesting about it. It's still firmly stuck in the era of collecting coloured keycards for doors, bulletsponge enemies, and AI that basically has two modes: running around in circles, or standing perfectly still while they shoot you with pinpoint accuracy. In spite of that, the game tries *really* hard to tell a story, has a big focus on immersion, and gives you a lot of stuff to do. It feels like it *wants* to be something more than it can be. It's campy though, and totally embraces that fact, being gloriously late-nineties, cheesy and over-the-top. Unfortunately, it's a fact that the game was rushed out in order to compete with Half-Life... and it shows.\n\nThe first thing I noticed upon playing the game again is how unresponsive it is. Movement feels very loose and floaty, and doesn't have the tight controls that many other FPS games of the same era do, which is a little perplexing. Despite this problem, the game forces you to engage in awkward platforming puzzles, mostly in the first quarter of the game, and it's really irritating. Once you've got past that, the level design becomes less lateral and more closed-off, so traversing the environment is less of a problem, but movement itself never \"feels right\" at all. It's hard to describe, but I'd consider it my main issue with the game. I found it a constant annoyance in combat, and even just when moving around in general, as I'd occasionally get stuck on the level geometry or find it overly difficult to make a simple jump. There's just nothing refined about the controls in this game, it all feels very archaic, and broken in its own unique way.\n\nTo expand on the changes to the level design I mentioned; as you get further into the game the levels become a lot less complex and more... Well, dull. I found the changes very noticeable, and its painfully obvious that most of the second half of the game was rushed. As the environments became less interesting, I started to wish the game would hurry up, and there were sections where I got bored enough that I started noclipping just to get through certain levels quicker, which isn't exactly a great sign. Lastly, the general difficulty of the game, if we were to normalise it, would be about average; but when SiN does decide to get hard, it gets infuriatingly hard. The game is plagued by short but ridiculous difficulty spikes. Cheap ones, caused by bulletsponge enemies, indestructible turrets, and snipers that can kill you with one or two shots, but are placed in positions that make them very hard to see and even harder to hit.\n\nThis isn't to mention the fact that on release, the game was incredibly buggy. Subsequent patches, both official and made by fans, have fixed it up enough that you're unlikely to encounter anything game-breaking these days. At the time though it played a big part in this game getting a lukewarm reception.\n\nSiN did some interesting things, and I find even its existence to be interesting, to be honest. I think it's a piece of gaming history that's been completely forgotten. In the modern day, I struggled getting through it at times, because it has aged quite poorly. But have a soft spot for it, and I think it deserved much more attention back when it came out. I really feel like if Half-Life had never existed, and SiN had gotten 6 more months worth of polish, people would still be talking about it today.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/7tgltf/xbox_game_pass_concerns_me_for_the_future_of/",
        "text": "As you probably all know, Microsoft has announced a big push for their Game Pass subscription service. They will be releasing their big first party exclusives day and date with full access to Xbox Game Pass. Considering that this means you can theoretically skip out on the 60 USD price tag for something like Crackdown, it's a pretty big thing, and a possible sign of things to come.\n\nNow, to be clear, this might not pan out the way MS is saying it will. *If* Sea Of Thieves, Crackdown 3 and State Of Decay 2 disappoint as many believe they will, then the stigma against the nature of the Game Pass I'll be talking about will be partially solidified already. And they've gone back on similar \"industry changing\" ideas before. Remember the \"end of console generations\" rhetoric they were spouting around 18 months ago?  \nThis might not take off. This post details my fears *if* it takes off, because I don't think a lot of people realize what we might be getting into. \n\nAny time a game company talks about \"changing the way games are made and bought\" it just sounds, to me, like corporate speak for *\"We're gonna figure out ways to generate more revenue for less work, and (in terms of digital distribution) assume more control of our products post-transaction\".* \n\nThis feels like a more on-the-surface-friendly, insidious and long-con form of Microsoft's DRM filled dream that they did the disservice of revealing to us in 2013. Problem is that people are eating it up in the early days because it's \"great value for money\" and because Microsoft is \"looking out for the consumer\".  \nIrrespective of the validity of the notion that there's a great value in spending 10 USD a month to play decade+ old games (and 2-3 year old games that were mediocre and performed as such) and some maybe okay MS exclusives without actually owning any of it, I feel like the value and quality of MS' first party games, and in the future, that of third party stuff and the industry as a whole will decrease.\n\nGames-As-Services became **the** industry buzzword last year, and for good reason. Ubisoft, WB, Activision, EA and Take Two were boasting about how much revenue \"recurrent consumer spending\" was pumping into there balance sheets, and projected that it's only gonna get more aggressive in the future.\n\nStrauss Zelnick not only said that Take Two is planning for every major game to have revenue tails, but he said that they're not monetising enough, implying that their microtransaction models are going to get more aggressive than GTA5.\n\nThe revenue Ubisoft gets from their digital game sales has now been exceeded by microtransaction revenue. And this was before the recent tweaks to their games like Ghost Recon and Rainbow Six.\n\nWhile there's no actual definition of GAS, when ever execs or marketing departments use the term, it often refers to multiplayer games that have continued support in the form of sporadic content updates and constant patches and adjustments. The amount of content they launch with is generally pretty meager, and they aren't received as the most robust experiences. They usually entail some sort of focus around microtransactions and/or lootboxes.\n\nThis emphasis on heavy monetisation and in some cases, seemingly low cost of initial development, doesn't stop publishers from charging 60 USD, whilst selling 10s of millions of copies. Yes, I know PUBG is 30 USD.\n\nAll of these factors culminate in publishers being incentivized to make most of their games in this vein, as at this current moment in time, it makes them more money. That's part of the reason why the \"death of AAA single player games\" rhetoric skyrocketed last year.\n\nAnd the best part is that it works. Despite initially poor critical reception games like Ghost Recon Wildlands, Battlefront 2 and others, the games are still at the top of the charts.\n\nSo the problem with a shift in consumption via a subscription service: These third parties would not get to charge that initial 60 USD. They would get some sort of lump sum and then residual payment from the platform holder (Microsoft), but they generally don't benefit from those 10 dollar subscriptions.\n\nMy concern then is that we'll see even more low effort, non-cutting edge multiplayer GAS, the core design of which being based on how much microtransaction revenue they can milk for players. Hence, worse games.\n\nSome people seem to think that this allows for an increase in single player games, using the Netflix comparison as a justification.\n\nThe problem is that movies and television are very different to games. Yes, Netflix spends a lot of money on original content now, but that wasn't always the case. It's happened now because of the fact that they have almost 110 million subscribers and are threatened by the competition of other streaming services such as Amazon Prime, Hulu, HBO Go, CBS Access, Disney's upcoming service and more. For Xbox, it's a completely separate thing. The Xbox is a closed ecosystem that Microsoft would have a complete monopsony and monopoly over. You want your game on their platform, you gave to go through them, and if you want to play a game on their platform, they own the only storefront.\n\nMicrosoft is not going to be pumping out a bunch of single player games all of a sudden either. Spencer may say that they \"might\" do it, but he's said a lot of things to sweeten up PR and he has rarely delivered. The emphasis on Gears, Forza and Halo in the latest press release also indicated to me that they're not actually going to be investing in first party stuff as much as they make it out they will be. It's to sell people on the idea of this, and some have bought it, hook line and sinker.\n\nWe also have to remember that not every Netflix original movie and TV show costs 100 million and that publishers aren't going to invest in single player games with similar budgets if they can't charge 60 USD. There's also no such thing as \"movies as a service\" or \"television as a service\". Once you pay for a Netflix subscription, that's it. No more money out of your pocket. They can't charge you to watch the last half of a movie or TV series, like they do in games. \n\nSingle player experiences require more thoughtful design that doesn't live or die on the novelty of playing with friends, and don't offer the same ease of implementation of microtransactions and loot boxes. These types of games are almost like consumables: They have a definitive beginning, middle and end. And there's not much potential for \"audience retention\" in that.\n\nThat's not even including all of the ownership nonsense as well. 5 years ago no one was okay with Microsoft taking away ownership for games from the consumer, so what's the difference now?\n\nNow this is all assuming multiple things that might not pan out.\n\n1. The quality and reception of Microsoft's exclusives this year will be a huge factor in the long term viability and consumer faith in such a business model.\n\n2. People might not be attracted simply because of the lack of ownership and lack of consumer durables. According to Take Two and apparently Ubisoft, physical discs are still the majority of the revenue they get from game sales, and it is probably true for other major publishers in the industry. The vote on net neutrality may also deter people from trusting online storefronts as quickly and easily too.\n\n3. Sony and Nintendo don't really benefit from trying to jump in on the semi-post console market. Microsoft is mostly profitable because of the amount of power they have on the PC market with Windows, Sony and Nintendo don't have any chips on that table. We already saw this with Sony rejecting the idea of a lack of traditional console generations in stark comparison with Microsoft. We see this with Sony's dedication to single player AAA titles. We see this with Nintendo's innovation, but staunch support of traditional console gaming at it's core.\n\n4. The GAS trend, as I suggested in a previous post, may come crashing down. It's already shown a significant level  of saturation with the failure of Lawbreakers and Paragon, and is seemingly showing some level of stagnation. This is anecdotal, but there seems to be this idea that the likes of Overwatch and PUBG have stopped growing, but I don't have any data on that. We do know for sure that Destiny is declining; it lost 2 million players a month after launch. The rot and stigma may have already set in, and now it's just a matter of waiting for the visible effects to show themselves. If I'm wrong or right about that Overwatch and PUBG stuff, please bring it up down below. This is before thinking about the looming government intervention that could absolutely kneecap the money made from these things. I don't think publishers are gonna pull back either. I fully expect them to act like Battlefront 2 didn't happen, or at least forget it by this holiday season. Blake Jorgensen's comments on the matter, and the EA and Activision patents for audience retention and recurrent consumer spending indicate that publishers are simply going to be more subtle and crafty when it comes to MTX.\n\nIt may seem like I'm jumping the  gun, but too many times in the games industry have people looked at  something, and thought it was harmless without recognising the *possible*  long term effects. We started with Horse Armor, now look where we are.

        "text": "It's not uncommon for a large portion of gamers to find challenging games more frustrating then fun. However unless I'm mistaken, this is usually referring to single player games. Rarely do I hear people attacking multiplayer games with the same argument, which is strange as they are potentially the most challenging games you can play because of the ever evolving player base and their skills. \n\nI'm possibly wrong, but it seems like players are much more willing to put up with challenges and are more willing to sink time into learning the mechanics of the games in these environments. \n\n",

        "text": "I live in Finland (I'm interested in hearing about the situation from people who reside in other countries) and received a Nintendo GameCube as a gift from my parents in 2004. The console was selected due to its \"better selection of games suitable for children\" as suggested by the electronics store employee, but of course GameCube in reality only had less mature-rated titles. Three games purchased with the system provided fun, but weren't optimal choices as I wasn't allowed to purchase any new games for a long time even with my own money.  \nPokémon Colosseum seemed very interesting, but was a disappointment as I expected a real-time fighting game and for some reason got stuck on Pyrite Town — believe me, how hard I tried to progress when I only had a couple of video games for a year or more. Multiplayer required Game Boy Advance with a link cable. Because school English education was at a very early stage I wasn't able to understand any full sentences, mainly only single words  and  even core gameplay mechanics such as passive abilities were missed. Please note that at this time I had no access to the internet.   \n[Disney's Tarzan: Untamed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney%27s_Tarzan:_Untamed) was fascinating, especially the \"surf\" segments, but was relatively easy to finish. We mainly played played Mario Kart: Double Dash with my siblings, but the game eventually turned repetitive, as a result of hundreds of hours gameplay. Additionally, as with all releases in the series, because the items aren't in balance the competitive appeal is limited even for children.\n\nThe availability of GC games in retail stores was poor and to my knowledge first-party Nintendo titles don't generally drop in price. GameCube selection seemed to always be under 5% of the PlayStation 2 library (I remember seeing only few GameCube games on the gaming department of a large department store), the games were overpriced (full-priced games cost more than 60€, I've confirmed this by looking at older magazine advertisements) and the stores commonly stocked the games I owned. We lived in a rural area and as stated above had no internet access, the games had to be bought during our infrequent visits to a city. [First-party games dominated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_GameCube_video_games), popular multiplatform series such as Need for Speed, Harry Potter and EA sports games were nowhere to be found.\n\nI eventually discovered specialized gaming stores, but at the time GameCube had reached the end of its lifecycle as the final games for the system were being released. I believe that my childhood would have been more enjoyable, to a certain degree, if I would have had a PS2 instead. I don't know how the original Xbox compares, at least third-party support was significantly better.",

I quit playing games shortly after my 20th birthday, was more into making music and other shit, and didn't pick back up until I was 26, when I bought a PS3 and played Fallout 3 roughly 6 years from its original release. That's the 2nd and last title I've experienced that made other games seem incredibly trivial. So what are some games that you've played that profoundly affected you and ruined other gaming experiences for the short-term?",
