The sample sizes would likely fluctuate between sample sites, whilst using the exact same collection pattern, so ideally I'd like to have the minimum fairly low (around 20 at the absolute floor) to avoid ridiculously high samples at other sites. Does 20 sound feasible? Also, if there's another sub this would be more suited to then by all means let me know.\n\nTIA",

For many, it’s obvious that rocks, water, and the like, are not teleological, nor could they possibly have stand-alone functions. This idea - that teleology and function are unique to life - is the target of this paper\n\nI suspect some biologists would deny there's \"teleology\" in either? \n\nI suspect it's particularly interesting how biologists may approach it from two sides - the natural science of how things can appear goal-directed (whether through internal structure and/or environmental forces), and ideas about computation and even our own phenomenal conscious experience of intentionality.",

If a creature had its pigments changed, what would happen? If a human had violacein as their eye pigmentation, would that affect how they perceive the world or would their eyes function the exact same? And what if eumelanin was replaced by pyomelanin? Would that be more susceptible to solar radiation? Or what about plant pigments being used in the skin of an animal, such as having a skin pigment be chlorophyll instead? How would that affect a creature?\n\nLet's assume this all to be the result of instantaneous and highly precise genetic engineering.\n\nI'll leave this open to more than just my inquiry on biological pigmentation because I'm very much fascinated in finding what the limitations of nature are and how I can use it to make a more believable fantasy world for my game publications!",

        "text": "I'll keep it short—I'm a 10th grader who is really interested in doing an internship with a biology professor over the summer, and I live in the United States. But I am currently undecided as to what field of research I should do for that internship.\n\nFor some context, I took AP Biology last year and did super well in the class (97 unweighted) and the national exam (4). The class really sparked my interest in biology and the study of life. Since then, I've been thinking about doing a summer research internship (unpaid, of course—I AM in high school) concerning some field of biology. \n\nI've been looking into some biology professors who I could cold-email asking for an internship. More specifically, I've been reading some research papers from various professors to decide whether or not their area of expertise in biology would interest me. However, upon reading their papers, I quickly realized that I had no idea what the heck I was reading. The research papers were far too complicated and in-depth for an aspiring researcher like me. Bear in mind that I am fresh out of AP Biology, so all my knowledge of biology comes from that course alone. \n\nTo clarify, I think I am interested in researching about cell biology, biochemistry, molecular biology, structural biology, or anything of that sort. So, I create this post to ask two things:\n\n1) Where should I start? Like, is there any place where I could do research at my level of understanding? I really want to do something like this, but I don't want to show up at the internship not knowing anything about the field I would be participating in. \n\n2) What exactly should I study? I understand that all the fields I mentioned just now aren't very specific. I just need a personal opinion, really: what, specifically, did you find interesting in the fields I mentioned that you think I also could do research on?\n\n3) Is doing this reasonable at all? People always tell me that I shouldn't do research simply because I'm not \"advanced enough\" or something along those lines. But I also see countless blogs, articles and videos that tell me that I can and should do it.",

Why can't secondary hyperalgesia be suppressed with NSAIDs?\n\nI know of two mechanisms that cause hyperalgesia.\n\nFirst, I learned that NMDA receptors open Ca2+ channels to increase excitability.\n\nSecond, I learned that prostaglandin increases excitability.\n\nAnd I learned that NSAID suppresses hyperalgesia, not pain itself, by suppressing the production of prostaglandin. But why can't secondary hyperalgesia be suppressed with NSAIDs?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2. I was taught that opiates must be used to suppress secondary hyperalgesia. And I know that the mechanism is to inhibit the action of substance p. Then, unlike NSAID, does it not only eliminate hyperalgesia, but also the pain itself?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm just learning physiology, so I have a lot of lacking knowledge.

        "text": "[Teleology and function in nonliving nature](https://philarchive.org/rec/BABTAF) in Synthese (forthcoming 2023)   \n\nGunnar Babcock, philosopher of biology, Duke university USA\n\n\n\n&gt;Throughout biology, it is generally taken as granted that teleology (or teleonomy) and functions are not only unique to life, but perhaps even a defining quality of life. For many, it’s obvious that rocks, water, and the like, are not teleological, nor could they possibly have stand-alone functions. This idea - that teleology and function are unique to life - is the target of this paper. \n\n....\n\n\n&gt;A torpedo that targets a ship regardless of where it was launched from exhibits plasticity. A torpedo also exhibits persistence when it reorients its trajectory back at the ship after having been pushed sideways by a current. \n\n&gt;Nagel, McShea, and others suggest that otherwise seemingly disparate teleological systems tend to share these two features. However, to understand field theory it is key to see that external, upper level fields are what generate persistence and plasticity. \n\n&gt;To see why, consider [the] example of a bacterium’s food seeking behavior. When a bacterium is swimming in a chemical gradient emitted from some food it’s seeking, it behaves with persistence and plasticity. No matter where the bacterium begins within the gradient, nor how it might get knocked off course once in the gradient, it continues on its trajectory towards the food. Why? The spatial field of the gradient. It is responsible for the bacterium’s end-seeking behavior. Absent the gradient the bacterium would not present anything akin to teleological behavior. And while there are many more details, this is the core of field theory.\n\n....\n\n&gt;When it comes to falling rocks, balls in bowls, and even the evolution of minerals, various upper level fields have been identified. That’s why these systems are less mysterious. The identification of these fields provides amazing explanatory value that allows us to understand these teleological systems. Locating the other external fields that direct more complex teleological systems is the best path forward in understanding these systems as well. \n\n&gt;Admittedly, one might worry that this robs life of some of its uniqueness. For example, that it robs the teleological capacities from something like the agency exhibited in human decision making. But accurately identifying fields doesn’t threaten life of its special status, nor does it diminish the freedom inherent to teleological entities if one adopts a compatibilist position \n\n\n&gt;Decoupling ideas about teleology from ideas about life is an important and necessary step in making progress in understanding both",

I'm interested in biology and science in general. The only thing that is that I don't quite know what I'm getting myself into. I often hear that it is really hard to get a research job, the pay is bad, and the work is boring. Is that true or did those people just say things? I would like to hear your stories.",

        "text": " I have this theory that stress in utero affects human brutishness, especially the tendency for promiscuity. Essentially, the hippie movement occurred in the 1960s and 1970s, and the same goes for the French \"It is Forbidden to Forbid\" (1968). Now, both of these were primarily driven by the young, by people who were born around 1945 (the end date of WWII). I don't know much about biology but it makes intuitive sense that stress in utero would affect development in such a way as to prioritize reproduction over the investment in offspring, with nature basically assuming that the former makes sense due to the likelihood that most will die. Presumably, a post-birth decrease in stress would also affect this, but probably to a far lesser extent: I'm basing it off the fact that I have displayed the same cognitive tendencies since at least age 6 (how my brain operates/the balance of chemicals).\n\nObviously, it's far-fetched, but I think considering it might make some sense. After Occupy Wallstreet, all the identity politics and stuff sprang up, and with the New Atheists, the religion of secular emotions (brutishness) has become completely mainstream (it's rare to find someone who cares about truth). I'm wondering whether you could somewhat consider all of it through the spectrum of biology or just economics",
