        "text": "As the title says, I was born and raised in the Hasidic community. For those of you that are unfamiliar what Hasidim are, the Hasidic community is a very religious and traditional community, with a lot of strict rules and customs. There’s a very big focus on staying isolated and not letting in any outside secular influences, which in result creates a very tight nit and family oriented community. \nAlmost everything in our lifestyle is completely different from regular society. From the biggest thing in life, like family, marriage, education, language etc, to the most little ones like, which shirt you’re allowed to wear, or which number blade you’re allowed to cut your hair. \nThere’s so much interesting experiences and observations that I can write about. It probably requires a whole book. But I’ll leave it up for your questions! \n\nThanks for reading!\n\nPs. I’m not in the position to put my face in public so the IAmA mods have verified my authenticity confidentiality. \n\nEdit 1: I thought I might get some questions but I wasn’t expecting sooo much so fast. I really thank you for your interest and asking questions!\nEnglish is not my first language and I’ve never formally learned to write English well. It takes me long to respond, but I’ll try to answer every question slowly. I’ll be back in a hour or two. \n\nEdit 2: I was out for a while and just checked back in, I’m speechless. I really do appreciate each and everyone that responds, I really want to answer every single comment. (I’m usually on the other end where I wait for the OP to respond) I feel like I want to grab a mic and scream shhhh, I’ll get to you all, just one at a time. But as of now I don’t see a mic button on the app. \n\nIt seems that if I answer the top question that already have hundreds of sub comments, my answer gets buried on the bottom. I think I’ll try for now to answer the newer ones and see how that works. Thank you guys!\n\nEdit 3: I’m still trying to answer your questions and I will try to continue in the next few days. \n\nThere has been a few people that had some interesting ideas and some even mentioned that they would want to meet. I don’t know if that can happen so fast but I would like stay in touch. I’m having a hard time finding a lot of people between thousands of messages. I figured I will create an email account and maybe it will be  easier to manage. Redditama2018@gmail.com\n\nHope this doesn’t violate any rules, if it does I will take it down. \n\nThanks you guys again!\n\n",

We just published an investigative report at [WATER.PENNLIVE.COM](http://water.pennlive.com) that digs into problems at the utilities and at the state agency charged with regulating them.\n\nIn December 2016, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency warned that Pennsylvania was risking public health by failing to properly inspect these systems. The state has been slow to address those deficiencies. Meanwhile, a number of large systems--such as Pittsburgh's--have seen repeated treatment and delivery problems.\n\nTo be sure, Pennsylvania is not alone. We've seen similar problems nationwide, including the ongoing public health crisis in Flint, Michigan.\n\nI'll be here from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m. EST to answer any questions you have. You can also follow my work on Twitter @wjmckelvey or at PENNLIVE.COM.\n\nEDIT at 2:30 p.m.: I'm heading out for now but if you have any more questions, please leave them in the comments and I'll return to answer them.

        "text": "## I’m Dr John Tregoning, Senior Lecturer at Imperial College London and Chair of an Imperial College animal Research ethics committee.\n\n## My research team and I study the body’s response to lung infections and use this information to develop better drugs and vaccines.\n\n## To achieve these aims, we have developed a range of cell culture and animal models of infection and vaccination. Ask Me Anything.\n\nGlobally, respiratory infection is the main cause of death and disease. Of particular concern is the rise of infections that are not treatable with antibiotics. My research aims to help us better understand how our body fights off infections, providing us with potential targets for new vaccines and new antibiotics.\n\nThe interactions in the human immune system following infection and vaccination are complex and not fully understood. This incomplete understanding means that experiments using either computer models or immune cells in isolation cannot fully reflect what is taking place in the human body. Therefore, animal models form an integral part of my studies, in particular they enable interventions to block or enhance different aspects of host defence.\n\nThe studies we perform closely reflect the work we do with samples from human patients. This overlap is critical in maximising our understanding. For example, our animal research demonstrated that when airway glucose is higher, there is more bacterial infection; which we have now shown in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. This work has led to a clinical trial of novel interventions targeting the airway glucose.\n\nBut, research involving animals is never undertaken lightly. We use literature review and *in silico* analysis to identify approaches of interest and validate these approaches using *in vitro* systems before ever moving into animal models.\n\nMy commitment to reduce, refine and replace animal usage is reflected in my role as Chair of the animal research ethics committee (Animal Welfare and Review Body, AWERB) which reviews Imperial researchers’ animal research to guarantee the combination of best science with the highest standards of animal welfare ([http://www.imperial.ac.uk/research-and-innovation/about-imperial-research/research-integrity/animal-research/regulation/](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/research-and-innovation/about-imperial-research/research-integrity/animal-research/regulation/)).\n\nProof: [https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/john.tregoning](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/john.tregoning)\n\nRespiratory infection research by me and my team:\n\n1.

Plus I've written for Law and Order, co-written a graphic novel (Cimarronin), and translated plays by the Nobel Prize-winning writer Dario Fo (a long time ago, but it was fun, so I mention it). This has taken me to 70 or so countries and allowed me to learn some cool stuff and share it with readers. My most recent book, The Wizard and the Prophet, is probably why Reddit contacted me. Some of its subjects include giant piles of bird poop, wars between India and Pakistan, the first U.S. oil-boom town, why photosynthesis is a couch potato, and how \"the environment\" was invented. Maybe it's shorter to say the book is about two dead guys nobody has ever heard of and the way we think about tomorrow. Or this: It's a book about the future that makes no predictions. Here is a sample sentence: \"Until I visited post-Katrina New Orleans I did not realize that rebuilding a flooded modern city would involve disposing of several hundred thousand refrigerators.\"\n\nhttp://www.charlesmann.org/\n\nProof: https://twitter.com/CharlesCMann/status/1013854837832863747",

        "text": "I have had multiple sleeps studies over the past 3 years all have given the same diagnosis of hyper-insomnia. At any given time I can go anywhere from 4 to 10 days without any sleep at all. For the most part I actually will go over a week before I feel tired. There are times of which I will get a migraine that will cause me to take something that will allow me a couple hours of sleep. Though normal medication does not help on a daily basis I do have sleeping medications that I can takeo. On a good day I am able to sleep for a couple of hours I wil normally falling asleep around 5 to 6 am waking up less than two hours later. I do not suffer from hallucinations. I have had this problem since I was a teenager so by this point it is normal.\n\nDuring the sleep studies they found that my Beta and Theta waves are both constantly running. This means that to my brain I am awake and asleep at all times. I do have times where I will physically wear myself down to sleep throughout the night. This takes hours of hard intense labor until my body cannot keep moving. Due to other medical issues it is not longer an option.\n\nBETA WAVES-These are known as high frequency low amplitude brain waves that are commonly observed while we are awake. They are involved in conscious thought, logical thinking, and tend to have a stimulating affect. Having the right amount of beta waves allows us to focus and complete school or work-based tasks easily. Having too much beta may lead to us experiencing excessive stress and/or anxiety. The higher beta frequencies are associated with high levels of arousal. When you drink caffeine or have another stimulant, your beta activity will naturally increase. Think of these as being very fast brain waves that most people exhibit throughout the day in order to complete conscious tasks such as: critical thinking, writing, reading, and socialization\n\nTHETA WAVES-This particular frequency range is involved in daydreaming and sleep. Theta waves are connected to us experiencing and feeling deep and raw emotions. Too much theta activity may make people prone to bouts of depression and may make them “highly suggestible” based on the fact that they are in a deeply relaxed, semi-hypnotic state. Theta has its benefits of helping improve our intuition, creativity, and makes us feel more natural. It is also involved in restorative sleep. As long as theta isn’t produced in excess during our waking hours, it is a very helpful brain wave range.\n\nAlong with this I suffer from other chronic illnesses which do not contribute to the condition. Including fibromyalgia, degenerative disc disease, seizures and migraines.\n\nEdit. Someone pointed out I had some major typos. Stupid laptop tiny hands big keyboard, lol. So I have hopefully fixed these if not I apologize.\n\nFor those that had questions already y thank you. For now I'm putting laptop up so any other questions I answer when am comes here. Time for me to read!\n\nI have sent in the needed proof and  this post has been verified by moderators.\n\n[https://wingsforthewind.wordpress.com](https://wingsforthewind.wordpress.com)  Some people asked if I would do a blog I have done some off and on post for harder times in my life here is the link for my blog that I will be doing day to day.
