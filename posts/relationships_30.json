        "text": "Backstory: My girlfriend and I have been dating for 7 months now. We used to video call every day for 15-20 mins. Everything was great until about two months ago, she stopped initiating gestures of love. For instance, every monthversary, we send each other a cute para but she stopped doing it or initiating such things. It started to feel like we are just bouncing questions back and fourth and not really having a good conversation.\n\n\nCurrent story: couple of weeks back, she told me that she had to tell me something and she said he depression may have relapsed. ( Note: she is not clinically diagnosed yet ) She justified her lack of gestures or our communication problems with her current depressive episode. I’m trying to be strong because I really do love her but it just hurts that it feels like I’m the only one putting effort and I don’t know how to deal with such a situation. \n\nI started therapy session and my therapist suggested if we could at least call two times a week at least just to maintain that connection. I would’ve totally been fine if we were texting but even that has become flaky. I have asked her if I was any one of the reasons for her to feel this way but she reassured me telling me that I am not causing it. \n\nI feel like I’m in a relationship where I don’t know what’s happening ( she said she doesn’t wanna talk about her depression). I would really appreciate some advice if anyone has gone through something similar. Please let me know you guys need any further information about us.\n\nTLDR; My partner and I are not communicating to maintain the relationship as she is going through a depressive phase in life. Advice needed on how to handle the situation.",

        "text": "I'm  having an issue with my girlfriend. Besides this one problem, she's  absolutely fantastic. Marriage material. Yes, there's an age gap here -  but I don't think that is the issue unless we're talking about emotional  maturity. We're currently at 2+ years, and I'm very happy with her.\n\nThe problem is - if I  am experiencing any stress in my life, she breaks down in tears, and  then rather than being able to focus on my problems, I have to focus on  her.\n\nThese are actually major problems, which I also view as opportunities.\n\nProblem  1: I'm finishing up a divorce after a long separation. Believe it or  not, this has NOT been stressful for me. Sure, it's expensive. But I  view ending a toxic and abusive relationship as opening the door on new  possibilities. I'm genuinely excited and happy about it. I haven't shed a  single tear.\n\nHowever, when I talk  to my lawyer on the phone in front of her, or discuss custody issues,  she breaks down and sobs. I then have to change gears and talk her  through MY problems, instead of being able to deal with anything for a  day or two.\n\nProblem 2: I was laid  off on Tuesday. Yes, this is stressful. But, I'll probably have a job on  Monday. I can't see myself being out of work for more than a week or  two. I work in consulting, which means my job is mostly establishing  good business relationships with people. When people heard I was laid  off and available, my inbox was flooded. I'm excited to start something  new and to make more money. I have savings to fall back on, so I am not  worried at all.\n\nToday she broke  down in the car and started sobbing. I had to take her home, because  while I am optimistic about things, I don't have to emotional space or  time to cater to her concerns about MY major problems.\n\nOn  top of these two issues, I'm also looking to move into a new place.  She's stressed about this, I'm not. I currently live in a small  apartment...this will be a very easy move since I don't have much stuff  at the moment.\n\nBackground: She  comes from a home where she was neglected by her parents. She moved out  when she was 18. She is on a couple of anti-depressants. If she misses a  day or two of her medication she cries uncontrollably. I came from  stable home, and I am not on any medications. I am older than her, and  she, in a way, leans on me for the emotional support and stability she  never had. I am very OK with this, but sometimes I have my own problems  that I need to focus on, and sometimes I view her crying as sucking all  the emotional energy out of the room. I feel like she's making my  problems her problems, and I feel, in a more practical way, that she is  making it harder for me to deal with major life problems.\n\nQuestion:  Is she just empathetic? Is she narcissistic (I don't think so)? Is she  viewing my problems as shared\"couple problems\"? Am I selfish to want to  be able to focus on very important issues without getting constantly  sidetracked to comfort her? Also, how much can people reference or lean  on their trauma to excuse their behavior? I know people don't just \"get  over it\", but using it as an excuse for everything isn't OK either.\n\nAfter  today's crying incident, I told her I needed to be away from her for  the day without any texting, which she will probably take very hard.  Like I said, I am very optimistic about things, but I just couldn't deal  with her anymore today.  \n\n\nTLDR; WhenI experience a major life problem, my girlfriend has a breakdown which causes me to lose focus so I can comfort her.",

I sent her my nudes a few months into our relationship one time since she said if I send them first she will send hers after. She never sent them and told me she deleted the picture. \n\nA few days ago I used her phone to submit an assignment and I stumbled upon my nudes in this folder in the files app. It’s obvious she lied to me about this so I then snooped her phone after she fell asleep to see if there was any other lies she told me and looked through her messages and saw a few messages that would reveal that she was also lying about me being the first kiss. I don’t care if I was the first kiss or not but I cannot tolerate a lack of trust in my relationship. I want to bring this to her attention because we both love each other a lot and we want this relationship to last, but a lack of trust and resentment is what ruins relationships. I’m just worried that guilt coupled with the fact that I snooped through her phone will cause an emotional outbreak in her causing her to want to break up. I’m very afraid of losing her and haven’t been too fond of taking risks like this but this can’t continue if our relationship is to be successful. Do you guys have any advice?

We are now on a break but are considering reconnecting. However, I am worried about getting back together for a few reasons. For example:\n\n* My gf tends to shut down during conflict: she goes cold and silent, appears stonefaced, and pulls away from me without explanation until she wants to talk again. It makes me very anxious.\n* When we encounter problems, she says things that subtly sabotage or threaten the relationship, like questioning whether we are compatible or not. \n* During good times, she can be very loving and appears to care deeply for me, but can turn quite quickly when she is uncomfortable or anxious. During a very nice moment between us, she randomly told me that she does not know whether she can love people deeply. This sent me spinning.\n* She is damn near inflexible when it comes to her schedule. I love her independence, it's one of my favorite things about her, but she does not go out of her way to do things she does not want to do. This includes things like picking me up from the airport, meeting me in my neighborhood before we go out for the night, etc. More importantly, I do not feel like we are part of a team.\n* During conflict, or when she feels pressured, she tends to forget how much she cares for me. During one particularly bad fight, I got so anxious that I asked whether she still loved me and she said \"I don't know.\" We briefly broke up after that and are (testing out) trying again now.\n* When we have split in the past, she disappeared for a few weeks, only to reinitiate the conversation each time by saying how much she missed me and cared for me. I am only now starting to see a patter, and am a bit wary of getting back together. \n* She has a pleasant but DISTANT relationship with her parents. She does not go home to visit them (instead visiting the families of her friends), even though her siblings both do. I am concerned that down the line, she will treat whoever she ends up with the same way.\n\nNot totally sure what to make of these habits. I do know that I love her, but I don't know whether I can do a lifetime of this, unless we commit to working together. \n\ntldr: questioning the future with gf of two years",

        "text": "Here’s some backstory. I’ve known this guy for 4 years and there has always been some sexual tension between us but timing never allowed us to pursue each other. Either I was in a relationship or he was or he befriended my ex and I befriended his…so it became a “can’t fuck with your friends ex” thing. Well, we ended up both de-friending each others ex’s for reasons of our own which then allowed us to get to know each other properly. We started this “situationship” back in October of last year and we never really labeled what we have going on. But as of recently he started saying things like “we’re not just friends” when I would refer to him as friend. And to be honest, yeah, we’re not just friends but he hasn’t said I’m his girlfriend so that’s why im landing on FWB for now.\nI keep asking myself if I should even be doing something special for him in the first place considering the confusing state that we’re in right now. \nI really like him tho bc my heart is telling me to. I got him a tangible gift for Christmas so I’m not 100% sold on getting a him another gift like that for his bday. I’d rather give him the gift of experience. An experience we can both share, enjoy, and remember. I’m drawing blank tho so please give me any ideas y’all may have. \n\nTL;DR: FWB birthday is coming up and I don’t know what to do for his birthday. I don’t want to get him a present, but instead an experience. Any ideas?",

        "text": "Hi all,\n\nI(31M) broke up with my long-term(2 year relationship) girlfriend(24F) recently and I wanted your take on things.\n\nWe went to the same uni(I was a mature student doing a 2nd degree), met online through a mutual interest(during the pandemic), realized we lived in same neighbourhood, I invited her over to my house and the rest is history.\n\nI really loved her. We would spend hours discussing history, philosophy, all sorts of intellectual topics, in bed or while sitting on a park bench watching the sunset. We had a lot of common interests &amp; hobbies &amp; loved talking about true crime, or just making stupid jokes. She was so sweet, affectionate, intelligent, I really respected and loved her.\n\nNow, to get to the point - we had to do long-distance for a while, as I had a job opportunity I couldn’t turn down and had to move across the country. I still made a significant effort to go visit her, she helped me move in the first place, I was worried it wouldn’t work but she insisted we could make it work, etc.\n\nIn July she spent a month staying at my place in this different city, and then afterwards she went off overseas for a month on a vacation. During that time, she very rarely called me, talked to me, I got the sense that something was off.\n\nI came back from my job in September and planned out a trip to visit her. I went, she acted like everything was fine, looked me in the eyes, told me she loved me, etc. And then a day or two later, we go out for dinner and she tells me wants to end things. I was completely blindsided - apparently she thought we had some issues that we couldn’t work through, but she never really communicated that to me. Long story short, we ended up not breaking up, sleeping together that night, and focusing on making our relationship work.\n\nHowever, I came back in December(from a 2 month trip I needed to take for my mental health after my dad died and I graduated), I had my suspicions and looked through her phone one night when she was sleeping. I felt guilty about it, but it confirmed what I thought. She was talking to her best friend about breaking up with me in September, and basically flirting with a guy she used to sleep with before we started then. I looked at her convo with this guy, and realized she’s been talking to him throughout the entire time we’ve been in a relationship. Not just casual conversations, but for example before she wanted to ‘official break up’ with me in September, she was already flirting with this guy saying “sorry we couldn’t meet the circumstances weren’t right :(( but I hope to see you again”. Or he sends her a picture of himself and she responds ‘you tan so well :) &lt;3”\n\nWhat really breaks my heart, is realizing that on Christmas, when my Dad had stage 4 cancer and was scared and alone dying in a hospital bed, she was texting this guy saying “Merry Christmas &lt;3”. I spent the whole day crying and worrying my dad was going to die, and we barely talked on that day. So I just feel so betrayed, disrespected, violated. She was there for me throughout my dad’s diagnosis and death, I told her all of my deepest fears, secrets, insecurities, etc, and I feel like.. how could she betray me like that?\n\nSo - my questions are, would you feel like you were disrespected or it was a complete violation of your trust in the relationship?  Would you consider this emotional cheating?\n\nThis is a girl who’s looked me in the eyes and told me how much she loved me, how she couldn’t understand cheaters, how valuable communication in relationships is, etc. I felt like she’s a completely different person than I thought she was.\n\nI loved her so much. I wanted to marry her, have children, travel, grow old together. We had so many common hobbies, interests. It feels like I lost my girlfriend but also my best friend.\n\nTL;DR! /TLDR-  I feel like my gf emotionally cheated on me and I can’t forgive her for it, but I want reddit’s take on the situation,",

I'm lying on his sofa writing this as he's at a spa hotel with a girl he's seeing.\n\nWe got together 3 years ago, lived together most of that time, lived together throughout lockdown and he has been and is my best friend.\n\nOur communication (especially mine) throughout has been poor and we did fight and bicker a lot. When it was good it was amazing. When it was bad it was awful. \n\nImportant to note: I've reflected a lot on our relationship and feel like I was a catalyst to a lot of our fights. I wouldn't communicate properly when I didn't like something and would sulk and be manipulative to get ny own way. He would suppress a lot and just appease to keep the peace. I regret this behaviour a lot now on reflection.\n\nOne year into our relationship we lived abroad and I went home to sort a visa. One week after leaving he slept with another woman. It was devastating but we fought so much in the lead up I feel contributed a lot to this. \n\nI forgave him because I understood my part to play. We spent a year rebuilding and I really saw a change. He was an open book and although we still fought a lot and it was a hard year, we made progress.\n\nThen he did it again.\n\nI left town, we had a few fights over the phone, he said he had enough then slept with a girl. (Last October).\n\nAt this point it didn't hurt me. I think I was so traumatised the first time around my brain didn't let it hurt this time. So we moved forward. In my mind, it was just sex, it meant nothing.\n\nOne month ago, we decided to live separately to  have space, but stay together. The same thing happened. I went out of town, we had a fight on the phone, he slept with a woman.\n\nI justify it because I feel like our rowing leads to him doing this, and that he doesn't want to be in the relationship at that time. He has said before although he loves me so much, sometimes he has stayed out of guilt of leaving me alone.\n\nThis time, we broke up. I didn't want to, we continued sleeping together and I even offered to be in an open relationship, but for the first time in 3 years he is emotionally checked out. He wants nothing to do with me in that way and I feel like I have now lost him once and for all.\n\nI found out last week that he has started dating a girl. This is not just sex like all the other women. They have a real emotional connection and I can see he is falling for her. I'm so broken, because I'm watching my best friend slip away with another woman and I can't grip on.\n\nI am temporarily living with him, trying to claw back our Relationship and get my best friend back before I lose him forever, but I feel like he's now slipping away fast.\n\nAlthough he has cheated, I have been no angel and have manipulated situations, been emotionally abusive and had poor communication. I am self reflective and completely aware of my flaws. We both have so much live for eachother. I feel it when I'm with him, but he is now checking out.\n\nLooking for some advice. Anything. How can I save this?\n\n\nTL;DR \nBeen together 3 years, great when good, terrible when bad. Best friends who live eachother. Cheated 4 times after fighting. Feel like my behaviour caused the fights and cheating.\n\nHe's now emotionally checked out but I want my best friend back. What can I do?",

The past year we’ve only had sex once, maybe twice (if I basically begged) a week, which has been difficult for me because I’m a very sexual person and the sex went from freaky/trying new things, to boring/seeming like a chore on his end. \n\nI brought this up to my boyfriend several times, but it wasn’t until a month and a half ago that he told me he’s been very depressed and has had trouble finding the interest to even engage in anything sexual. I told him I was sorry for my multiple unreciprocated advances, and that I would leave the ball in his court from now on. \n\nI have been true to my word, and have stopped initiating anything sexual while still complimenting his appearance often to never let him forget how attractive I find him. He initiates sometimes, so we have sex probably once every two weeks. He agreed to go to therapy, and has attended one session so far. He also got his testosterone level checked, found that it is low, and made an appointment to meet with his doctor to be prescribed something that will safely bring him to the level he needs to be at. \n\nI’m proud of him for doing things to help himself, and I’ve been as supportive as possible through the whole thing. I show him as much love and care as I can. With that being said, I’m suffering a bit. \n\nThe lack of intimacy is difficult for me…more difficult than I thought it would be. I feel unattractive, boring, undesirable, you name it. I’m in good shape and most would say I’m conventionally attractive, but it’s difficult to not be desired by the one you love, regardless of how confident you may be. I know this is not his fault and I’ll never make him feel like it is, but it’s still hard to deal with. \n\nI don’t know when it’s okay for me to start initiating anything sexual again, have a sexual conversation with him again, etc. Any tips on how to deal with the sexual aspect of having a depressed partner? Any similar experiences? Thank you in advance.\n\nTL;DR- my boyfriend has been suffering with depression and has no interest in engaging in anything sexual anymore. I have since left the ball in his court, and the lack of intimacy is negatively affecting me",

We see one another every couple of months for about a week at a time, however when we do see one another, sometimes it can feel like we're getting to know each other all over again and I have to admit I feel stagnant and really sad about this.\n\nOur conversations don't go very deep, and sometimes I feel like I have to pry things out of her. It's interesting because my last relationship, we could talk for 10+ hours about anything and everything over the phone/video chat and I absolutely know and recognize that every relationship is different, but I can't help but wish we had that. Those endless conversations about everything, talking nonsense, asking the strangest questions...we don't have that. mind you, I'm not comparing this relationship to that one-- my current partner and ex are two vastly different people. But I just...I want us to...ugh I don't know.\n\nI'm a very touchy-feely person, it's part of my love language to hold and to be held. And I feel like I've been the one to initiate things, walking up to her to hold her just because, or trying to have passionate moments with her where we just kiss and make out and such. I've even initiated having showers with her so that we can be more intimate and close.\n\nI think we've only had sex a total of 4-5 times and again, I've always been the one to initiate it.\n\nShe's told me before that she's not a very touchy-feely person and I absolutely understand and respect that but gods I am so touch-starved...It feels like I'm trying to meet her needs without mine being met? I don't know...\n\nI don't know if she's waiting for me to do something or say something but I would like for her to....idk just reach out and touch me? When I try to kiss her it always turns into her pecking me with these tiny kisses that I just...what do I do with that?\n\nIt just genuinely feels like we're friends...or maybe we'd be better off as friends? We get on very, very well, and a lot of what we want in life matches up. But sometimes it feels like I'm settling because she accepts me entirely for me, without question. But, I don't know how happy I am?\n\nShe tells me frequently that she loves me and I...hm. I have love for her, but I'm not sure how deep that love goes. She makes me happy, genuinely, but I need more? I don't know lol, I feel like I'm stuck and at a loss of what to do. I know I can talk to her but gods I don't want to hurt her. She's HSP (highly sensitive person) and I hate to see her cry. And I've not brought up some of the things on my mind because I have no idea how they'll be received...ugh.\n\nRight now she's with me, visiting for 6 days. She got here on the 8th and we've barely been intimate? Barely any real kisses, no sex...it's just been us on opposite sides of the room and it's so hard for me gods. This is certainly something I will bring up to my therapist, and honestly, I've spoken to some of my friends about it too but...yeah idk.\n\nI know this is all over the place, but any thoughts/advice would be greatly appreciated...but also writing this out felt good too..maybe I'll read this back later.  \n\n\ntldr; my girlfriend and I have two very different needs out of our relationship and I feel lost..",

        "text": "TL;DR: I don’t want to label myself as my partner’s girlfriend bc we’re young and inexperienced. Partner was hurt at first, but thankful for my honesty and grateful that I value his and my freedom. \n\nI’ve been with my partner roughly a year and a half. One week ago, he surprised me by calling me his girlfriend. I was pleasantly surprised as we had discussed a couple months prior how we were tiptoeing around labeling our relationship, yet we were fine with what we had, even if we weren’t ready to describe it. Even a mental health professional thought it was a healthy decision for both of us to not rely heavily on labels. I suppose that changed when he first told me he Loved me. “Love” is a word I don’t take lightly and we’d talked about that months before he said it. It was kinda cute how it happened: We’d had a heartfelt conversation about familial relationships and we both wanted to say it, but hesitated. Then we opened up about why we were hesitating. I told him that I was afraid I would hyper-fixate on wanting to move near him so we could be closer, which could take months if not years, since we both had recently made big life decisions and moved to a different place in our respective states. This fixation could put a strain on our relationship, I’d feared. He said he understood my concerns and assured me there was no rush bc our love for one another developed without me making these changes. Then he said he loved me. Since I personally believe love transcends time and space, I told him I loved him too. That feeling has not changed and I don’t think it ever will. \n\nA few weeks later, I brought up the idea of polyamory and open relationships. I was honest with how I felt, saying that we were young and inexperienced, so it would be selfish of me to deny him of experimenting with others, especially since I’m pansexual and he’s bisexual. He was uncomfortable with what I said and asked for clarification, to which we discussed how we felt for a couple of hours. We talked about our insecurities. My biggest insecurity was the potential inevitability of one or both of us developing a strong relationship with another person, that we would not be the primary support partner for each other, which could get tricky if we shared assets one day. His biggest insecurity was me seeing other men. Even though I’m pan, I don’t form strong bonds with others very easily, so it is unlikely I’d have enough time to even see other men, let alone anyone else on the spectrum. But since our libidos are different, I still thought it a good idea to open up an avenue for both of us to experiment regardless. We came to the conclusion that for now, monogamy is best as there’s so much richness in one another that we’d like to explore. I still believe this. \n\nBut one week ago, he called me his girlfriend. And while I was happy, it’s also a term I take very seriously. Quite frankly, it’s a label that has implications of being fully committed to each other’s well being. I blushed and giggled, and called him my boyfriend, openly communicating my surprised joy. For me, this was a sign that it wasn’t foolish of me to spend the next couple of years securing a life with him. \n\nThat brings us to today. He asks me if I’ve ever experimented with women before and I replied with of course. We never had a problem talking about our past relationships, so this question wasn’t out of the ordinary for me. He says he’s never experimented with a man, but he’d like to one day. I asked him if this meant that he wanted an open relationship, to which he replied he think he could see himself in one. I thought it was a nice thing we could have a conversation about later to see how we should move forward with our relationship. i.e., I wanted to set time aside later to talk more about it before we made that decision. Then he asks me, “Does this mean we’re in an open relationship?” I laughed and asked “Already? 😆”. He said yes. \n\nOkay. I realized he was serious and remembered that not only am I young, but he’s even *younger*. There’s so much space and beauty in this world for a person in their 20s to explore, and even though we’re committed to each other now, there’s no way in hell that’s guaranteed for a lifetime. I love living in the moment, yet I also like to prepare myself for the future. And the future I glimpsed when he told me that was full of resistance from the loosely monogamous relationship we currently have. A familiar knot in my stomach formed and I asked myself if I was acting on insecurity. It didn’t feel like insecurity; it felt like maturity. So I told him that I loved him and because I love him, I’d like to remain label-less. At first, he thought he’d done something wrong. So we talked for an hour about why I made my decision. My idea of love is being committed to my partner’s wellbeing and a HUGE part of my wellbeing is freedom. If I want freedom for myself (even if it’s not geared toward relationships), it would be selfish of me to not grant that freedom to someone else. It was hard and I did cry later, but I believe I saved both of us a world of confusion, betrayal, and hurt. \n\nHe told me that no matter what happens between us, he will be eternally happy and grateful he got a chance to love me, which is something I’ve told him in the past. \n\nI still love him and he still loves me. I’m so young, though, and it eats at me that I’m being foolish for not wanting to be his gf, at least not yet. I don’t have a problem with open and poly relationships, but I only brought it up to him bc weren’t officially bf &amp; gf. I want to be closer to him, but I want to give him space to explore other people.",

        "text": "idk if this is the right place for this though if it's not please redirect me to a better place.\n\nSo at church we were all playing a game (like my whole grade and one above so all in the same age range) and we were all I'm a circle, I was across from him and he was staring in my direction, probably zoned out cause he was just like staring and because I'm how i am I smiled (to not seem rude ofc) and widened my eyes at him and he instantly smiled and looked away, after we both got out of the game while we waited for it to end I had two options, sit next to him or a random other kid I didn't know (little context here, he's my friends brother and I hang out with a lot of people he's friends with so yeah I guess I semi-knew him?)\n\nSo I sat next to him and one of my other friends sat next to me so I was talking to her and he randomly started talking to me asking stuff about my family and just like my life in general, he asked about siblings and stuff like that and eventually we started joking around before we had to go sit down. He sat in front of me not knowing it and then he turned around to stretch and saw me and smiled super wide and started waving and I waved back and he kept looking back at me and either smiling or trying to joke around, I was like \"yeah maybe there's someone behind me-\" but unless I responded to it he'd just continue on and there weren't any rows behind me either so-\n\nAfter the lesson ended I was walking back inside after walking my friend to her car and I decided to be bold and I joked with him, one of his friends was throwing a Frisbee at him and I was like \"are you being murdered right now?\" And he was like \"yes, I'm being held hostage.\" And we joked around  for a bit and once again he asked me stuff like if i was in the lower grade in the group or the higher one and stuff and idk he seemed nice and friendly and he's funny and stuff so my question is, are there grounds for me to talk to him again on Sunday? \n\nThis happened about 2-3 days ago and I'm seeing him tomorrow was he just being nice in the moment and if I talk to him again on Sunday would that be weird?- Or could this be the start of a friendship possibly? Its not like he didnt seem interested in the conversation either, if he was on his phone or looking somewhere else if I started talking he'd instantly look at me and lean in to actually hear what I was saying.\n\n(Added thing, we've talked one single time before but thats cause he was talking about how he was taller than his sister and her friends and she was like \"are you taller than *my name*? Go stand next to her.\" And we joked around then, not sure if this info is needed but yk 💅✨️) \n\nTL:DR we've talked twice, joked around and he seemed nice, can I talk to him again or was he just being adventurous that day? And follow up, how would I do that?-",

        "text": "A lot of context. I (24F) run a YouTube channel with three of my friends. We’ll call them A (32M), B (21NB) and C (20M). We’ve all been a friend group for over two years, but some of us knew others in the group for longer or shorter. This is more about A as the channel used to only be his, but the rest of us joined in. Partly because we had ideas for it that he liked, but also because doing it solo was stressing him out. I was very excited for this opportunity in particular as the channel is on a topic I really enjoy, plus I love creating media and posting it. I’ve been having a blast with it and put a lot of my worth into what I create. Things started out great. We hold meetings to plan out what releases when and have systems in place. I’m also doing a majority of the marketing. It’s great!\n\nWell a few months after making this a team thing, I started to notice things. First of all, I’ve posted the most content out of the four of us. I thought this was fine and inevitable, since everyone else had full time jobs and other responsibilities (I’m currently jobless and not in education, so my only other responsibility is my own channel). Plus I really wanted to help where I can. I’m pretty useless in other aspects of the channel, so I want to do as much as I can where I won’t suck as much.\n\nThen A’s mental health started to slip and he went on hiatus (the rest of us were in agreement that this is best). Since again I don’t have a life, I tried my best to fill his place to ensure that the channel still had frequent content. No one told me to do this or anything. I just took initiative since it would only be for a couple of months. I also started planning a backlog of content for when I go back into education in September, so I don’t leave others dry.\n\nThen a few days ago, B mentioned that they wanted to take a step back and take a more supporting role. They wouldn’t be quitting or on hiatus. But they wanted to focus more on behind the scenes stuff. While telling us this, they mentioned to me specifically not to try and fill the void that they leave and they noticed I was doing that for A. I explained that I didn’t mind and that I really wanted to help since I don’t have anything else going on besides my own channel. But they insisted on this and urged me to slow down. When I then mentioned that I needed to start a backlog for when I started school, then instantly shut down the idea, saying it would likely destroy me.\n\nI feel like I’ll be fine. But they sounded serious and I know to trust them when they’re like that, so I said I’d slow down. How do I explain this to A though? Unlike the rest of us, he treats the channel more like a business than the rest of us and likes things a certain way. Like missing deadlines stresses him out and he cares about the statistics a lot more. I was happy working at the rate I was at, but if a friend sees an issue with it, I trust them. But the other friend might not notice or understand. Plus I don’t want to upset him or make it seem like I’m stepping back too.\n\nTL;DR One friend is worried that I’m working on a group channel too much and wants me to slow down. How do I explain this to our other friend?",

        "text": "(been together for 2yrs)\n\nI was out with some girlfriends all night, I hadn’t heard from him all night, no text, no call, which is fine- but abnormal for us. He played his video game all night. I texted him and asked if he’d pick me up because I didn’t want to drive under the influence, wanted to sleep in my bed, and cuddle w him ofc. He said yes ,, 20 min later he calls me and while we’re on the phone he says he’s too stoned to pick me up and he’s going home. Ofc I respect his decision - but I was bummed- I had thought he was on his way and I was excited. He thought I was being short on the phone, and I could tell he was kind of annoyed with me. I wasn’t trying to be short- but I was with my friends still- fast forward - I text him and ask if he’s going to bed. He said yes. (He’s a huge gamer- so when I checked discord and it said he was playing a game I wasn’t shocked) I texted him and said oh, it says your playing a game online? He said his computer must have been left on- but that he was going to bed- and didn’t like how I was treating him. (He explained that I was trying to start an argument by making him feel bad for not getting me- and he was immediately triggered when I brought up it said he was online) the conversation ended. \n\n\nWhile this was all happening I was at my friends house eating and drinking water- I hadn’t drank anything in hours so I decided to drive home. When I got home I was expecting to lay next to him in bed but instead he came out of his game room and I could tell he was mad I was home. I wasn’t being rude I just said “you lied” because it’s been over an hour at this point since he said he was going to bed. He even shut off the ability to see that he was online on his game so I wouldn’t be able to check?! I don’t understand why he went to these extents... we got into a huge argument he told me to get it out of his room because I was invading his privacy that all he wanted was some peace and quiet and that he doesn’t like that I was in his business by checking that he was online and made me out to be the bad guy. I was so confused because he was being so rude!! I am mediately regretted driving home because I didn’t want to be there after he started yelling at me. I packed a bag and drove to a parking lot, balled my eyes out, then slept in my car. However only slept for 15 minutes. A few hours later I decided to just go home and sleep on the couch. I would hardly say I actually was able to sleep because I was so distraught all night. He left for work two hours ago, and I can’t stop replaying it all in my head. When he was yelling at me last night, he said that I was a master manipulator that he wasn’t gonna let me flip all of this on him, I didn’t name call him, I wasn’t trying to argue- but it seemed like nothing that I did could’ve changed the fact that he just didn’t want to talk to me be around me be nice to me etc. \n\n\nI think he was taking his frustration out on me. He had lied to me, said that he wasn’t playing games, then I walked to the door and he was. I think he just felt guilty because he had been caught in lies- but for him to turn so nasty on me it’s not OK.. I don’t know if he’s going to text me. I don’t know if he hates me. I don’t know if I should leave before he gets home. I wish he would apologize and understand me\n\n\nWhat do I do... I haven’t even slept 😭😭\n\nTL;DR?\n\nMe (f21) bf (m29) \nI asked if he’d pick me up after drinking w my girls, he said yes then called me shortly after and said he was too high to get me, that he smoked and now can’t drive. I was bummed but I understood. I messaged him and asked if he was going to bed and he said yes. I check discord (and see he is online playing games) I asked if he was online bc it said so and he got triggered and said no again- turned off the ability to see that he was online- and when I got home an hour later- he wasn’t expecting me to come home ig- bc he was caught in a lie, I walked through the door and he was playing games at 4am- we got in huge fight- he yelled and said I was invading his privacy and I’m an issue- I slept in car- after he yelled to leave his game room",

        "text": "To preface I have no problem with him studying with people and having friends. It's the other circumstances that make this weird to me. My (24f) partner (22m) and I have been in a semi-long distance relationship for 1.5 years. He's in nursing school right now and I'm trying to be as supportive as I can with him by helping with studying, making lunch, and even helping him schedule things etc . . . We only get to see each other once a week in person, and yesterday, my partner told me that he spent an hour talking to this female classmate that approached him and asked him for help with studying. He said he wanted to make sure and run it by me first, but I have some issues with this for a few reasons:\n\n\\- We have this ritual of him calling me after class on some days to have company on the way home, that's one of the ways we stay connected to each other and make that little time for one another. I made sure to have my phone around me by then but he didn't call until an hour later and said he was talking to this classmate. I would have appreciated a heads-up?\n\n\\- He's gone on multiple tangents about how he doesn't like studying with people and that studying by himself works better for him. He even referenced another nursing student who spoke during their orientation and said he studied alone, so he's most likely going to do the same.\n\n\\- He lives far out so the commute is tough. As is, he complains about not having enough time for sleep, self care etc. . . which makes him more stressed out. He says \"I am definitely not staying in the city longer than I have to.\" He didn't even want to stay after class for his group project meetings and asked to do it over zoom instead. But now that this classmate of his had asked for help (they're not friends, this is the first time they spoke) he's willing to do this.\n\n\\- I'm not against him studying with other people, and I want to be as supportive as possible with his schooling and making new friends. But one of the biggest issues I have with this is that the classmate said \"Let's study at the library\" which is a 30 minute walk from their building. There's a common area for students inside the building and 20 study rooms that are available for reservation there. It's a big campus in a city. If your schedule is tough but you really think you need the help to study, why not just stay in the building? To walk 30 minutes just to settle down and study in the library sounds like more is being made of it than it needs to be. There's tons of things to do in the city so on that 30 minute walk there are tons of places to go and grab lunch and make a day out of it.\n\n\\- He said that him and his classmate both shared the same difficulty of a tough schedule and that maybe she went up to him because he could relate more. But if they both have such difficult schedules already. . . how does it make sense that she's going to ANOTHER person in the same boat as her to make their schedules even harder?\n\n\\- He doesn't like mentioning that he has a partner to his classmates. We've had this talk before and he would be hurt if I did the same. His reason is that he comes from a strict religious background so it's taboo which I understand to a degree, but I said I didn't appreciate it and felt disrespected by that. He said he did mention it to her though because she asked how he studied for the exams, and he said he studied with me which is helpful.\n\n\\- I know I'm not in his program and am not a resource like his classmates are, so I think studying with his peers can be beneficial. But if she knows that he already studies with \"his partner\", am I wrong to question why she would ask him to help her study too? Nonetheless at the library that is inconveniently out of the way?\n\n\\- When I asked him how he'd feel in my position he said he would feel a bit uncomfortable about it, even more so if I had the same schedule and made time out of my day to help a classmate like that. But he says that he \"sees some value in it too\" even though he constantly says how he doesn't want to study with others because helping someone else catch up could confuse him even more. He said that if I wanted to study with another guy one on one that he's never met he'd want to come with or drop by to bring food or something. I can't even do that here.\n\n\\- This is the same classmate who said he felt \"violated\" by when they were doing a hands-on assessment in class, but he laughed it off and said so did everyone else.\n\n\\- Only after I expressed that it made me uncomfortable did he mention the possibility of me being there.\n\nI don't want to be controlling or jealous. I just don't have a good feeling about this and feel like he's going wherever the wind blows. I feel like more boundaries could have been set up rather than him telling her \"oh well maybe. . .\" and going along with it. I feel like the relationship and I am not being considered but I know that my emotions are at the forefront right now. What do you think?\n\nTLDR: Partner said yes to studying with female classmate who he's never even really spoken to before but he already has a tough schedule and wished he had more time for himself. He always says he doesn't like studying with other people too, but he is willing to do this. He didn't call me when he said he would and spoke with her for an hour about it instead. I'm feeling uncomfortable about it.",

Because of this, I am able to pay her mortgage, part of her parents' rent, helped her start her own business, etc. I visit her at least 2 - 3 times a month.  She announced that she will no longer be visiting me because she is too busy with her business.  I am already planning to forfeit my pension (which I would get after 5 years) and leave this company after 2 years to be with her (when my 401K vests).\n\nShe seems to think I am made of money.  She just bought herself a new car and I can't afford to and she is mad at me for it. She wants us to get a third house and I can't afford the down payment and she is mad at me for it.  She seems to think I have thousands of dollars in savings and I don't.  I explained this to her.  She wants to travel and is mad at me because she thinks I don't want to. Meanwhile I was going to surprise her for her birthday with a trip to France - bought the plane tickets and planned everything out - and she told me to return it.  I offered to take her up to the nearby city and we could stay in a hotel and she didn't want to.  She's mad at me that I would offer for us to travel domestically while we wait.  All of this would go on a credit card, by the way, because I can't afford it right now, but that's okay. I just want to make her happy.\n\nWhat can I do? I'm at a loss. She was being so kind to me last night and today she is fuming for some reason. She doesn't even want to talk to me on the phone. She has a headache which usually means her period is coming soon; last time her period came she screamed at me that she never wants to live with me again because my drain was clogged in my apartment; could it have to do with hormones?  I am a woman too by the way, so please don't call me sexist.\n\n30F, 30F, tl;dr can never please wife",

        "text": "TL;DR There's two problems\n\n1. I don't think I ever want to have sex with my GF given how our relationship started with me defending myself as \"not just trying to hook up\"\n2. I feel stuck in the relationship. To be clear, I want it to work. I have some doubts but I also have lots of hope for it and want to put work into it. But I don't feel like I have the option to leave if I decide the relationship doesn't work for me.\n\nPlease be kind, I'm very sad right now.\n\nFull Post:\n\nWe were friends first and then SOs. We were great friends, and we started to develop feelings for each other and are now going out for 3 months. We had a really shaky start in the relationship though. She basically thought I just wanted to hook up and was really mad at me for this and threatened to cut me out of her life and our mutual friends' lives. We clarified things and are going out now and aren't going to have sex anytime soon until we're sure of things.\n\nBut I don't think I *ever* want to have sex with her? My feelings are complex, but I feel like I have to be 100% sure of us as a long-term couple before we have sex (given how we got together). But I don't know how to *ever* be 100% sure... probably just at marriage. I think she's much more sure than me because this is her first relationship, so she moved very quickly (too quickly imo, we had to talk about clinginess and slowing down).\n\nIn fact I'm having doubts now that we've been together for a while. It's possible that we're not meant to be together. I want to make things work and problem solve with her because I think she's great and worth it... but I do have doubts.\n\nThe problem is I feel like I don't have the option to break up even if I decide the relationship isn't for me. Because last time she threatened to cut me out of her life and our friends' lives. I am *terrified* of that. I hate that we can't be friends after. And I hate the idea of losing many friends and my support network. And it sounds like she's kind of threatening that if we break up, so I feel stuck. I feel like this comes from immaturity but idk.",

Didnt get the chance to meet back then. We first met after almost 2 months of chatting, calls and video calls when she visited me for a week. Things were magical and we decided to be exclusive. Once she left we had our ups and downs but after that I visited her twice for almost a month and a half in total. But since last couple of months she keeps getting confused. We even broke up once and only to patch up the next day when I was visiting her. I thought that would have given her some clarity but the cycle continued. Now we hardly talk once a day but she is also visiting her family so I think thats okay. We still say that we are figuring it out to our friends. She has raised sometimes if we should date other people to see how it feels, I have been clear that would mean ending things on my end. I have started to realize she cant end and neither can I but I feel the more we drag the more we will get hurt. I have asked her clearly if we should end things instead of dragging as the limbo has start to impact me in other aspects of life. Also if we cant end how can we make it better from here. Another thing I feel is she is just biding time now and trying to cut off and will leave once she feel better about it. I am afraid I am gonna get hurt either way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR; M(32) Dating this girl(29) for more than 9 months but we are still not clear. Things started to go down after few months.

By thinking I realized that I don't want the surgeries for myself, rather than to please strangers and having them to accept me. These are not good reasons for permanently alter your face. In addition, surgery scares the hell out of me. To sum up, I won't go under the knife. As soon as I can I will try to speak to a therapist about my self-steem issues. \n\nI feel a little sad, because it means that I will always have a weird face, and many people will judge me and reject me. But I don't want to lose myself and I don't want to risk loosing my boyfriend.\n\nI then talked with him and made sure he knows that I understand why he reacted like he did and thanked him for helping me to see the truth. He was happy to know that I wasn't having surgery (He took my face in his hands and spent 5 solid minutes kissing my nose and my cheeks). He asked me not to do countouring on my nose nor getting my hair on my face with the purpose of hiding anything.\n\nTLDR: I won't go under the knife, but I will see a therapist and I reconciled with my bf",

But then a couple of weeks ago, we saw this friend at an event and he was clearly drunk and a little too much with the hugging, etc with her. More than you’d expect to see. Flash forward to today, and I oversee a text where she tells another friend that she can’t go on another group trip where the ex is present because she doesn’t trust herself not to have sex with him. I really don’t know what to think. Did she already cheat? If she feels this way, is it too far gone? We’ve been married a couple of years, no kids.\n\nTl; dr: something that isn’t cheating happened between my wife and an ex and it seems like it isn’t completely over",

        "text": "This is long, I’m sorry haha. I’m a guy who is very cautious who I date (I’m divorced and been burned badly) and don’t even consider getting into a relationship very easily. I know what I have to offer and what I need so I’d rather be single than in a bad relationship.\n\nRecently I finally was ready to take the leap. I’d been seeing this woman (25F) with a kid for a few months. We live an hour away and she has her kid every other week so seeing each other was great, but not super often. Like 1-2 times a week. We connected so well in person, and I loved our calls whenever she was able to answer, and we texted all the time.\n\nEarly on we really hit it off and she started talking hypothetical future situations and making plans and I found myself buying in. And after each date she would always say how much she loved it and loved creating these new memories with me. She had said she was a good communicator, and it seemed that way. She reassured me when I needed it, and we could always talk about things in life we disagreed about in a healthy way. Things were going so well.\n\nOne thing that was difficult was that she would say that she wanted to date me, but didn’t want to be in a relationship yet. And I thought it made sense due to her past and not knowing each other for super long so I understood, but it did make me feel a little anxious sometimes since she did it in a way that was a little hot and cold (“I really like you and I just bought tickets for us to go to a concert in July”, “I think we need more time to get to know each other”, etc.). But I was ok taking it slow because I trusted her and wasn’t trying to rush things either. \n\nThen last weekend shit hit the fan. We had been planning on her coming down on Saturday and going to a play we’ve been planning on for a month, and spending the weekend. On Friday night she went out with a friend who just got cheated on. We had texted about her sending me funny drunk texts and texting back and forth a bit, and I also told her to be supportive of her friend. Well she occasionally sent me some pictures and I would respond and flirt (usually within 45 minutes) and ask how it was going to check on her, but she would respond in like 30 minutes with another picture but without responding to my actual texts. I ended up falling asleep at 11:15 and she got super mad and at 2 am said she hated when I did that, “what if something had happened tonight”, and said we needed to postpone the weekend date. I told her the next day I was sorry and didn’t realize that she expected me to stay up talking to her but that I’d be more than happy to next time now that I know (she only goes out like 3-4 times a year).\n\nOn Saturday/Sunday there was minimal interaction. On Monday she called and we talked and she said she understood me and that she missed me and was embarrassed by how she reacted. Then after the call she texted and said she missed me and said she could come down this weekend. I felt things were better. Then Tuesday morning she texted me good morning, called me babe, and said she was thinking of me. I responded and said I was too and asked how her day went. She said it was the anniversary of one of her friends deaths and that she was super anxious. So I asked what I could do and if she wanted to talk and she said maybe a call later. After work I went to see Creed and texted her to say we needed to go together, and all she said was “yeah”. Then I tried calling her and she sent it to voicemail after 2 rings. I texted her saying I called her to check in that I was thinking about her, and said to call me back when she could. All she did was like the message and I never heard back.\n\nThis kind of communication is a dealbreaker since I need to be with someone who can communicate and work through unintentional miscommunication and pain that happens. Looking back I can’t really see any red flags to avoid this, but it’s so frustrating because a small part of me keeps saying that maybe I could have done something better and that this past week was just a one time bad communication (I know it’s not) and I keep reliving the conversations and also looking at the lost plans we had made and get sad. I obviously don’t want to be in a relationship like this and I never will be, but my old anxious attachment is coming out and I’m just frustrated at myself for it. I feel like I wasted so much time and energy only to be completely lied to, and it makes me feel like a horrible judge of character. Has anyone else been there and have any advice?\n\n\nTL;DR Great potential with this woman and dated for some months. She got upset I didn’t stay up texting her all night when she was out drinking with her friend. Ended up apologizing and calling me babe again, making plans, only to then ghost me. How do I not let this happen again?",

        "text": " \n\nWe have been in a relationship for about 6 months. We both love each other. I can really feel her love but sometimes she can say really heartbreaking things.\n\nOkay, so the other day we were talking about physical appearances and how it affects the way people fall in love or to have a crush on someone etc. Also before this conversation was going on I told her how my friends adore my physical appearance etc. and she said that’s why she doesn’t compliment me that much stating that you get compliments from people around you and that’s enough for you. Don’t get me wrong, she does compliment me but not so often like I do to her.\n\nLater that day, we were talking a guy she used to see but she didn’t go out with him because of some reasons she didn’t tell. After that, she told me that if she considered physical appearance she would definitely go out with that guy and not me. She said he was so handsome etc.\n\nI kinda felt like “ouch that hurts” but didn’t make her feel bad and not say that I was a little hurt.\n\nI really think that physical appearance is not the only thing a girl thinks when she is looking for a guy but it kinda hurts that she doesn’t like my appearance or at least that’s how I feel.\n\nI have to say I am \\~6 feet 5 (195 cm), I workout and successful in my school. People always appreciate my work and habits.\n\nI don’t know if I should really think about this. It’s breaking my heart a little bit. I understand that she very comfortable around me and that’s why she is talking about other guys freely but it sometimes making me insecure about myself. I didn’t use to be insecure about my face but now I sometimes feel like that.\n\nI know don’t have my old face, I have a stressful life comparing to my old days. My old friends see the change and say that I look very tired and it reflects to my face. So, I understand that’s why she doesn’t adore me that much.\n\nSo my question is, should I be bothered that this is happening? Am I being a little dramatic? Should I accept this and move on?\n\nI really love her but sometimes these feelings and thoughts; bothers and haunts me down.\n\nI really appreciate if you read this and gave me an advice.\n\nThanks for your time and have a great day!\n\nTL;DR: My girlfriends sometimes say things that are lowering my self esteem. We have talked about other guys etc. She makes me feel underrated. Am I being a little dramatic? Should I be offended?",

        "text": "I've been wondering about this topic recently. I am a female in my early 30s.  I transitioned early on and was lucky to escape the damage of male puberty. After I had the sex reassignment surgery at 18; I pretty much stopped using the word transgender to describe myself. I don't see myself as part of the lgbtq community really but more of an ally.  I am extremely selective of whom I disclose to. In my opinion: no matter how open minded or kind a person is, soon as they have this piece of information you are automatically othered and treated as a pity case or a freak. I am certain that people will never treat me exactly as a biological woman if I disclose. So I don't.  None of my close friends are aware of my past. It's not being ashamed of my past; actually I'm quite proud of how far I've come.  I just don't want people thinking of me as something I am not.\n\nI also relocated to another country and started new with noone really knowing my history.  I'm not on social media so there is no digital footprint. I don't have high risk of being outed but I know the risk is there all the same.\n\nI've been with number of men since transition. Many were short term flings. I don't  feel the need to disclose my history if it's just a fling. If i am in a relationship, i do tell men i cant have kids for medical reasons. I've dated one guy for 4 years and another for 2 years but didn't tell them of my trans history because I couldn't see myself marrying them. My most recent boyfriend I've been with for 5 years now and I know he's the one. We're engaged now and I told him about my history last week. It was honestly the hardest thing I had to do. It was the first time I told a guy that part of myself. Thankfully, he was able to accept me and wants to be with me  but he's still struggling with it a bit.\n\nMy take on disclosure is that i don't feel the need to say anything unless I know they are the one and we plan to be married. I also don't expect a guy to share information of similiar gravity with me unless we are engaged.  Just dating or being exclusive  isn't good enough for me. They have to be the one if I am going to risk sharing something so personal.  They are free to leave if it's something they cannot handle.\n\nI know it's a controversial topic. I am I in the wrong?\n\ntldr; I'm a post op trans woman who doesn't disclose my trans status to men unless we plan to get married. I am I in the wrong?",

How should I deal with a married man that I might be interested in whose my supervisor and who also still lives at home with his wife and children?\n\nThe man who has been my supervisor for the past couple years recently expressed romantic feelings for me. At the time, I thought he was divorcing, but I've since learned that it's a case where he's been very unhappy in the marriage, feels that it's at an end, and is planning to get divorced. But for now at least, he's living at home with his wife and teenaged children.\n\nHe's a very good man and someone who I could see building a future with. We've begun to talk about what that would look like. I've never been married, and would like to try to have a child, even though I know it will be very difficult and my age, and he wants that too, even if it means IVF. Also, I don't want to be alone the rest of my life, and I could imagine being happy with him.\n\nSo far, nothing has happened between us other than these serious conversations about the future. But of course, I don't like feeling as though I'm the other woman while he's still married and living at home with his wife and children, or that I would be the woman he would leave his marriage for. I do believe him that he has had serious marital problems, and I think, but don't know, that he's sincere when he says he was already planning a divorce.\n\nWhat should I do? Should I tell him that we can't talk about it anymore unless and until he at least gets separated and files for divorce? Or is it all right to be thinking and talking hypothetically about a future, as long as we are not actually having an affair?\n\nI don't know which way to turn, and need advice.",
