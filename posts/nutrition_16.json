Most articles say high fat moderate protein but I have also heard that processing fat is really heavy on your liver/kidneys. So having 60% fat sounds rather intense as well. Additionally, carbs get a bad rep nowadays but your body is really good at extracting energy from sugar and not so much from fat. Your brain needs the sugar as well, so idk, i am bit lost :D\n\nClarification: I am not talking about keto which seems to be a rather extreme feeding regime, I mean just a reduced carb intake something like 20-30%. What should the other 70-80% be made of,  provided you a normal caloric intake of about 2000 calories a day and generally non-processed nutrient dense food?",

Things keto, Mediterranean, asian, etc. \n\nWhat I am curious about is what would be the most nutritionally effecient meal planning would be not including things like variation or taste. I like eating because i don't like being hungry, but I am never that obsessed with tasty food, I just want to not be hungry. And it got me thinking, if I wanted to have a completely rounded 3 meals a day for the least amount of money and effort, what does the human body really require each day? \n\nThanks for the consideration.",
