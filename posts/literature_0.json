        "text": "‚ÄúThe Girl on the Plane‚Äù (Mary Gaitskill, 1993) is not the first story in the collection to feature themes of misogyny, sexual assault, and the fragility of masculine ego, but it is the first to do so through a modern lens. \n\nJohn Morton is a middle aged salesman on a business trip. He embodies the prototypical ‚Äúalpha male‚Äù traits: he views every woman he interacts with as a potential sex object, emasculates an airline employee both out loud and in his own head, and views a very clear cut case of date rape from his past as a complicated situation. \n\nHis seat mate on the plane, Lorraine, opens a discussion with him about her life as a recovering alcoholic. As it turns out, John and Lorraine spent their college years in close proximity, but their experiences were markedly different. Lorraine describes her attempts to flee from and free herself from the shackles of a life that John found most enjoyable. Lorraine reminds John of a girl he knew in college, Patty. The dialogue jumps back and forth from the present conversation with Lorraine to reminiscing about Patty. \n\nAt a party, Patty becomes totally inebriated - to anyone looking on, it‚Äôs clear she‚Äôs lost her ability to make decisions. Men at the party start sexually assaulting her, and John is asked to join in. At first he is hesitant - he stops a partygoer from pouring maple syrup on her passed out frame, but doesn‚Äôt stop another man from dumping beer on her. He ultimately participates in the gang rape and seems to forget about it until the conversation with Lorraine. \n\nLorraine admits to mistakes in her life including a failed relationship and leaving college, and John counters with telling her about the night with Patty. Lorraine is understandably horrified by his admission, and refuses to engage with him any further. John can‚Äôt understand her reaction, and fake back on the tired old excuses of ‚Äúit was complicated‚Äù. He ultimately tries to apologize to Patty through Lorraine, but it is no use. \n\nQuotable: He reached out to gently pat her hand to reassure her he wasn‚Äôt a nut, but instead he grabbed it and held it. ‚ÄòIf you want to talk about mistakes - shit, I raped somebody. Somebody I liked‚Äô‚Äù.",

These types of movies tend to revolve around characters in their twenties and early thirties who are dealing with romantic or sexual issues, and are pretty aimless in both their professional and personal lives. \n\nSome well-known films that can be considered 'mumblecore' include Frances Ha (2012), Drinking Buddies (2013), and Nights and Weekends (2008). \n\nMumblecore movies tend to be low-budget productions that emphasize dialogue over plot and focus on the personal relationships of young adults, and utilize naturalistic acting and dialogue that is sometimes improvised. As someone described them, they're somehow about nothing and yet everything at the same time. They're often very raw and honest, and the earlier movies tend to explore Gen X people searching for meaning.\n\nWhat is some literature, particularly from the 2000s or at least the 90s onwards, that shares similar conventions, themes and feelings like mumblecore films? \"Mumblecore lit\" perhaps, if you will. It's not quite slice of life, or \"indie\", although it is closely related, it's a fairly specific subgenre in its own right.  \n\nDo you know of any, and did it compel you?",

        "author": "Fantastic-Leading276",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/literature/comments/11q0gu1/is_shakespeare_immortal/",
        "text": "In my current study of the Classics, the idea has been reinforced that Shakespeare is continually read and taught because, despite the change in context, his ideas are transhistorical and universal. His plays are relevant forever because they continue to resonate with a modern audience. The way he captures the essence of humanity is incredible, and therefore his works connect with each new generation. \n\nMy question is, to what end?\n\nDoes it come to the point where we have to move on? \n\nA classic is a work that captures \"what oft was thought but never so well expressed\". Basically, it illustrates an incredibly common, popular idea that everyone has experiences, but does so with a skill and eloquence no artist has before. \n\nTruly, the irony of posting this on Reddit, a locale notorious for vulgar expression and a mockery of the very axioms of the english language, is not lost on me. \n\nThe fact is, the current momentum of progress is such that the world we shall inhabit in 50 years will be unrecognisable us today. With technology, digital landscapes, and information systems only growing in prevalence comes a gradual but drastic shift towards a brave new world unlike any we could comprehend. What place then, in this distant world of automation and technology, will the likes of Shakespeare hold? Just to interact with his world requires such a leap of imagination, and this will be only amplified as culture and society shifts around us. Why should we make the effort, just to connect with a so called timeless classic? \n\nBecause the truth is, it is the nature of reality and progress that old things die to give way to the new. Whether people, institutions, concepts, or art, a thing but evolve or be swallowed by the jaws of time and forgotten forever. Yet the same standard is not held for classics. Classics are said to have done it best, and so, like chess, need no revision adjustment or replacement with the passage of time. \n\nSo, the question arises, does Shakespeare express the universal human themes best? Or did he just happen to be the lucky one who did it first, and therefore is exceptional by comparison. Indeed, currently Shakespeare is the standard by which all other works are measured. How can anyone be as perfect if they always compare themselves to perfection? His writings have stood the test of time, but can that not be largely attributed to our continued study, reading, and production of his work? Does this not become self-perpetuating? Where works deemed classic are taught and read for their continued relevance, but they are only relevant because we continue to study them. Shakespeare would not be the central tenant of our culture that he is if not for the endless appropriation and adoption of his narratives, symbols, and characters. \n\nIn fact, even if Shakespeare was forgotten, the cultural impact of his work might never fade. To call someone a Romeo, or to jokingly ask \"to be or not to be\" while contemplating suicide, these subconscious contributions are so keenly embedded into popular culture, that, like a damn spot, they might never be truly removed. \n\nSo again I ask, will Shakespeare die?\n\ntd;dr Shakespeare old, world new, he was pretty good, but is it time to move on?",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/literature/comments/11p6gz1/the_fragility_of_human_hubris_analyzing_the_theme/",
        "text": " \n\n*‚ÄúOzymandias‚Äù* is a sonnet written by the English poet Percy Bysshe Shelley in 1818 and originally published in the11 January issue of The Examiner of London in the same year; it tells the story of a traveler who stumbles upon the ruins of a once-great empire in the desert. The poem explores the theme of human mortality, depicting the descent of an arrogant and non-benevolent ruler and the fleeting nature of all human achievements.\n\n&gt;*Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown,*  \n*And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,*  \n*Tell that its sculptor well those passions read*  \n*Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,*  \n*The hand that mocked them and the heart that fed \\[‚Ä¶\\]*\n\nThe poem begins with the traveler‚Äôs encounter with a sunken statue in the desert, almost near-completely consumed by the sands of time, which portrayed the king Ozymandias, a greek name for the pharaoh Ramasses II (r. 1279‚Äì1213 BC), whose ruling is suggested in the text to be built on arrogant premises of becoming everlasting and awe-inspiring, hence the spine-chilling inducing inscription at the statue‚Äôs bottom.\n\n&gt;*‚ÄúMy name is Ozymandias, king of kings:*  \n*Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!‚Äù*\n\nHowever, the speaker highlights the contradiction of the monument‚Äôs boastful claim in the traveler‚Äôs description, which underscores human mortality in the Manichaeism of a mighty-empire ruin and the bleak desert, which renders Ozymandias pretentiousness insignificant and forgettable.\n\nA first depth of semantic analysis casts the inherent need for legacy constructions as a defiance against the oblivious nature of time in contrast to human existence. On a psychological level, the instinct to outlive our limited stay in the material world not only speaks about the preservation of life ‚Äî which is a concept embedded in all life forms‚Äîbut also reaches out to the metaphysical *spectrum* of the mind, that will inevitably, in a due moment, reflect on life expectancy and propose itself to, conscious or subconsciously, elaborate theoretical ways to overcome its fragility.\n\nOne can argue that the fear of death is, intrinsically, the founding of every religion or even the reasoning behind the *soul*. Suppose we assume that the concept of a *soul* is nothing more than a product of the mind, being the mind a construct of the biological brain. Isn‚Äôt the very abstractions we create to comfort ourselves when faced with the weight of time the most credible evidence that humans‚Äô ultimate goal is to deny their mortality? Isn‚Äôt the legacies we generate, whatever they are, plausible assumptions that we will perdure? If something is left behind, *will we* live through it, and therefore, will our existence had not been in vain?\n\nPerhaps it is men‚Äôs vile needs to outsmart the trials of time that for so long fed false premises of immaterial eternity and raised empires that were meant to last forever, fueled by delusions of grandeur. As Ozymandias‚Äô kingdom, all of them have failed. To list a few:\n\n* **Roman Empire,** one of the most powerful empires in civilized history, lasted for over 500 years before it fell apart in 476 AD. Its collapse is attributed to many factors, including internal political instability, economic problems, and invasions by barbarian tribes.\n* **Mongol Empire,** one of the largest, reigned for about 150 years before it dissolved in the late 14th century due to internal strife and political fragmentation.\n* **Ottoman Empire**: known for its longevity, lasted for over impressive 600 years before it collapsed at the end of World War I. Its demise combined military defeats, economic problems, and internal unrest.\n* **British Empire**: once the largest in our history, it existed for more than 300 years before it finally plunged in the mid-20th century as a result of decolonization movements and economic problems.\n* **Soviet Union:** one of the most fearless empires in the 20th century, it lasted for about 70 years. It was dissolved at the end of the Cold War in 1991 due to political and economic problems. The fall of the Soviet Union changed modern geopolitics and irreversibly divided Eastern-Western diplomacy.\n\nThe king of kings‚Äô rise and decay is well established by Shelley‚Äôs sonnet; shortly after the reader‚Äôs perception is filled with a brutal strength perpetrated by the emperor‚Äôs *ego*, the whole construction of greatness is unmade by the terrifying calm of the vast desert, which silences Ozymandia‚Äôs speech. Like on a rollercoaster, the poem‚Äôs narrative imagery reaches its zenith*,* only to drop again; as the adage goes: *‚ÄúThe higher they stand, the harder they fall.‚Äù*\n\n&gt;*‚ÄúNothing beside remains. Round the decay*  \n*Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare*  \n*The lone and level sands stretch far away.‚Äù*\n\nThese lines suggest that all human accomplishments are transient and ephemeral and that the only thing that endures is the natural world. In a second depth of interpretation, the test of time has been a philosophical dilemma in our reality and an extensively explored source of imagination in all forms of literature.\n\nIn many dystopian literary pieces, the extinction of humankind is usually followed by a recovery of the Earth‚Äôs natural state. Many games, movies, and series set in a post-apocalyptical world, for instance, present gargantuan trees that penetrate any, if not every, urban architecture, wrapping the gray of man-made structures with a radiant green, showing that when challenged by nature, humanity is ultimately little in the immense scope of time and space.\n\nOne can say that, similarly to the debris of Ozymandias‚Äô statue, Earth‚Äôs recovery in dystopian stories confronts our tendency towards greed, destruction, and exploitation. Both represent the consequences of our collective actions and choices, alert us to repress our evil nature, and never let the darkest aspects of the human self come to light. Perpahs is the death of arrogance that will enable a more sustainable and equitable future and ensure that we can be proud of the legacy we create.\n\nOzymandias‚Äô downfall and the speaker‚Äôs contemplation of the ruins argue that humbleness is a crucial trait for humans to cultivate, as it allows us to live in harmony with others and the natural world. In a final instance, the poem suggests humility can be a source of strength and resilience in adversity and what separates democratic and inspiring leaders from tyrants.\n\nIn my last argument, it is safe to assume the best legacies humankind can produce are the ones that concern themselves with the betterment of our species and not self-image. The ones that do not preoccupy with their longevity ‚Äî Such as Shelly‚Äôs poem‚Äîare what leaders should rely on.  \n\n\nThis text was originally published at [https://medium.com/@dohlerarthur/the-fragility-of-human-hubris-analyzing-the-theme-of-humbleness-in-ozymandias-d87de9eceae3](https://medium.com/@dohlerarthur/the-fragility-of-human-hubris-analyzing-the-theme-of-humbleness-in-ozymandias-d87de9eceae3).

        "text": "Early reflections:  about 20% done, I just finished Auerbach‚Äôs Celler for those that remember the scene. \n\nFirst of all Faust is a play written as rhymed verse and presents itself essentially as poetry.  I am reading it aloud to myself each night which can be loads of fun because Faust is highly entertaining, and often quite hilarious. \n\nThere are passages that can be hard to parse, but then a character will come out and say just that, so don‚Äôt worry, you‚Äôre in good hands with von Goethe, he knows the path he‚Äôs taking you down. \n\nI‚Äôm surprised by how readable and funny it is.  If you‚Äôve read The Master and Margarita you‚Äôll get the same feel here, a romp with the devil, which is only natural as it was Bulgakov‚Äôs inspiration. \n\n\nI‚Äôm reading the George Madison Priest translation. \n\nAnother bonus is the Illustrations, a beautiful Franklin Library Edition (the green on from 1981) which can be had at a pretty reasonable price.",

        "text": "Alice Munro‚Äôs 1990 story, ‚ÄúFriend of My Youth‚Äù, is equal parts eulogy and gossip. Our unnamed narrator reminisces on her deceased mother and the disease that stole her voice and face before claiming all of her. The narrator recalls a story of a companion her mother had before getting married; the pious, unassuming, tolerant, beatified, Flora Grieves. \n\nFlora‚Äôs tale includes fanatical religion, a lover‚Äôs betrayal (twice over), a life dedicated to serving an increasingly ailed younger sister, and of steadfast dedication to family. Though the narrator and her mother come away from the storied life of Flora with differing perspectives, the respect and admiration that the mother has for Flora is the narrator‚Äôs focus. \n\nIt leads her to consider the generational perspectives women have on their role in society, their role in their household, their relationship to sex and men, and how to navigate all of it ‚Äúthe right way‚Äù. The reader comes away knowing the narrator‚Äôs love and grief for her mother, and her mother‚Äôs love and grief for Flora. Of all the changes they face - the factor that remains static is the quiet and enduring love of women towards one another. \n\nThis one will strike a nerve with anyone who has grieved a woman - as I come up on my own departed mom‚Äôs birthday, it‚Äôs hard not to think this story came to me at precisely the time I needed to hear it. The opening description of the narrator‚Äôs dream about her mother visiting her resolved of the disease that killed her and full of serene forgiveness for the narrator‚Äôs own guilty feelings is something that could‚Äôve been plucked from my own brain. I see you, Ma. \n\nQuotable: ‚ÄúI used to dream about my mother, and though the details in the dream varied, the surprise in it was always the same. The dream stopped, I suppose because it was too transparent in its hopefulness, too easy in its forgiveness‚Äù.",

While I do like to just experience stories, I also want to understand how they work etc. \n\nSince I got done with school a while ago and also took a bit of a break on reading, I found myself struggling with recollecting what I've read. Obviously there are general outlines and main story beats but not enough that I could work on understanding the book. I do take notes while i read (habit from back in class). I'd stay a lot of the theoretical background is present, the only things I struggle with is the application either during or after reading. \n\nI wanted to ask if you have any tips or tricks that will help me with coming to a deeper understanding of what i read. \n\nThanks a lot in advance",

They all seem to focus on primary works instead, and some of the big ones like Paris Review even got started because of not wanting criticism, apparently. \n\nMaybe there's even some website I've never heard of that does this at an amateur level, and that'd be great, too, but really all I find online in community sites are reviews and pretty shallow opinions. \n\nI'd even settle for more places with thoughtful reviews to check out.",
