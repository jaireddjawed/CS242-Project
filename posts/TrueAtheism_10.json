Probably not though. Yeah everyone on here will probably agree with you over your parents but that doesn't change the fact that it will at best be a hassle and at worst make your remaining time with them a living nightmare. I still havnt told my father and I don't plan too. Ignorance is bliss, I know he's to stubborn to change his mind and even if he did it would ruin what lil happiness he has so let him go on believing. Not hurting me. Bottom line respect peoples beliefs, even if you don't share them and they're stupid. If you keep your mouth shut and just be respectful chances are you'll never have too deal with that awkward screaming match. EDIT: I should add that this is a situational thing and that you have to know how your parents will react. It could be that they are totality supportive and helpful but for many that is not the case. I live in the bible belt and it would not have gone well to say the least. But that may be different for you. Bottom line, be respectful even when people may not deserve it. People are way more likely to show you respect and maybe even change there opinions when you calmly present facts instead of yelling. And that goes for theist as well as atheist. But if your parents seem like the type to cast you out based on your beliefs then maybe wait until you can support yourself. Maybe just don't tell them. ",

        "text": "As an atheist, and very much involved in what one would call \"counter\" apologetics; I am not one to refrain from listening to the attempts at refutation. Interestingly, I quite enjoy their rebuttals, and at times the challenge is exhilarating. Although, there can be some that are just down-right repulsive attempts, and shows how much of a moral and intellectual regress people will go through, simply to justify their faith. \n\nFurthermore, this comes to be the case when discussing slavery: a very controversial topic in theistic apologetics, and in human history as well. From the past several hundred years, we have been able to observe the effects of slavery, and owning people like machines, simply to do their bidding; we understand that it is very relentless, and does little for the betterment of humanity, and the treatment of evil disadvantaged people. The Trans-Atlantic slave trade, was a dark time in recent history, and something that is easily argued as immoral. The forcing of labor, the refraining to acknowledge a human rights standard, and the horrendous cruelty and treatment of these people, who were just simply at the wrong place, at the wrong time. This being common practice in ancient civilizations, and was hardly ever regarded as wrong, and was economically beneficial to those in usage of slave labor. The problem lies with the integration of slavery, and how it is acceptable, in Jewish/Christian theology. Moreover, not only was this acceptable, but condoned to a disgusting sense. As I read further and further, I understand more and more about the Bible, and it does nothing but reinforce my resentment of it (mainly, the OT). \n\nAlthough, various apologists for the Abrahamic faiths, find this an obvious detriment to their narrative, and the over all message of \"God is morally superior, and morality is meaningless without him.\"\nDefenses for this concept of slavery, being not only glorified but the only alternative in the bible, are common and I feel are blatantly dishonest. For example, there is commonly the claim that slavery as we know it, (African-American) was by far very different from Biblical slavery. They go on to add that it was more indentured servitude, it gave more benefits, and it was the only way of relieving any previous or accumulated debt. That said, the part about willing servants, to pay 6 years for a relinquishment of their basic human liberties, and freedom is absolutely correct; although this only is in reference to Hebrew slaves, not ones obtained from various tribes, genocides and sold from other nations. These lesser fortunate slaves, can be set free, or kept for life. Also, they can be subject to being sexual servants, along with being kept for as long as they are beneficial. I don't see this commandment being something that can be attributable to a morally perfect God, with omnipotence. This form of slavery is very easily comparable to chattel slavery, and it has me in shock to see the desperate attempts at justifying this. \n\nOverall, this isn't a proper representation of history, or scripture itself. It apparent that an equally immoral form of slavery existed at these times, and the masters and people operated with the concept that it is morally acceptable to God, and that he commanded it. The typical definition, which I still find incoherent, is not aligned with this portrayal, and over-simplifying and not addressing the shockingly evident fact that the Bible seemingly condoned this, and it was conducted and defended due to this fact. I find that reprehensible, and not a character I would deem worthy of worship (if he was demonstrated to exist, hypothetically). \n\nInstead of inventing a more efficient method of relieving debt; God chose to give them details on how to beat, own and use people to their benefit, and simply couldn't come up with a better means of relieving debt (Even addressing indentured servitude) with all that omniscience and omnibenevolence. Also, his commands to kill, and steal the remaining benefactors (usually young, virgin women) and use them for whatever brought them satisfaction; I find just even more convincing that such a character is more invention, another form of literature. This simply cannot be the commands of a morally superior being, and I find it contradictory for those to defend that position, while cherry-picking certain parts of the bible that defends this. \n\nI find it dishonest, and simply disgusting that such attempts were made to defend the idea, and they couldn't simply adhere to the secular morality most of the apologists support, as a form of judgment toward even their source material. \nIf I have anything incorrect, or my conclusions are up for question, please feel free to comment and criticize (rationally). \n\n",

        "text": "I am an atheist but I recently realized that there is an issue with diversity among atheists.  I knew that it wasn't a very diverse group, but I didn't realize why exactly this is an issue.\n\nSo, for the yet uninformed:\n\nIt is fairly well known among atheist or religious debate communities that it is statiatically evident that atheists are primarily white, male, more intelligent, of higher social status, and infrequently incarcerated. \n\nThe latter three items are often used as arguments as to the general superiority of atheists, or as an argument for why some people should be come atheists.  However, correlation does not equal causation in this case.  Being atheist doesn't really make you a better person in those last three ways.  The real reason atheists are more prominently represented by the intelligent, rich, and unincarcerated is that such things moreso allow you to be an atheist.\n\nSo rich and/or smart white dudes, right?  We have it easy, moreso than most of us believe.  [Here's an article with a simple diagram that illustrates this](http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2016/06/27/on-views-of-race-and-inequality-blacks-and-whites-are-worlds-apart/)\n\nAnd of course many of us that fit within the above demographic don't easily see the issues faced by females or poor people either.  We either don't believe in their problems or we think they deserve them. That is because of a psychological phenomenon called the Just-World phenomenon, in which people who have an easy life tend to believe that people get what they deserve, whereas people who have a hard life don't believe that at all.  Of course the truth is naturally somewhere between both sides' beliefs.  \n\nAnyway, for worse rather than better, atheists have learned to believe that we are, religion aside, socially better off than people of religious groups more or less because we don't believe in God, or that we are smarter than other groups, which has led to both our success and lack of faith.  \n\nWell, there's the issue with our demographics.  Religious groups offer so much more to people who are at a natural disadvantage than atheism because their active communities are more popular and more focused on fighting issues like violence against women or racial underrepresentation.  Meanwhile, atheists are generally only fighting for the honorable cause of free speech and the less-worthy cause of removing religious symbols from public facilities.  While they're still somewhat fighting a good fight, it's still not an initiative a socially disadvantaged person has the time or money to care about.  So what does this mean atheists need to do?  Instead of just saying that we are morally superior to religious groups, we need to support weaker demographics with our communal efforts rather than just fighting for atheist tolerance.  Atheists as a group are already starting to look bad after some high-profile mysogyny that has resulted in PTSD.  If our active groups fight for objective moral goals like equality for racial/sexual/LGBT equality or protection, we will not only attract a stronger base for disadvantaged demographics but we will also look better in the eyes of the general public.  Right now our methods and goals are simply met with widespread resentment.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "This happened this week. I was in the local community of people of my national origin (which is one of those brown people nations colonized by Spain and thus supposedly devoutly Catholic). I just got out of a comic conventions so some of my relatives and I had merchandises and wearing shirts related to super heroes and anime characters, etc. So when we were walking by one guy started calling us in the local slang the equivalent of \"man child\" using a word that roughly translates as \"penis\" (there's more to the word thats complicate to translate but basically its a way of using the word penis to imply you're a sheltered manchild living in your parents' basement). \n\nWe were just minding our business when that guy started hurling out this insult. In particular I was insulted because I'm not even a comic geek per say (and I only started reading comics again this year) so I'm definitely not a virgin man in his 30s  (hell I just had sex a few weeks ago with a friend). \n\nWhat bothered me was that this guy was by reputation in this time ( I soon discovered) was reputed  as a \"very religious person\" who does all the typical stuff such as weekly religious service and treating religious statues as sacred, etc.  In fact he was acting Saintly according to my friends (the same one he insulted) when they attended mass later (which I skipped because I'm not a Catholic anymore).\n\nHowever outside of church he continued insulting my friends that day and not just him but in the congregation were staring at my comic con friends and were gossiping about them. My friends told me they heard from the gossip \"those imbecilic children, they're still reading comics\" and things of that nature. \n\nThis all reminded me of how ISIS wants to ban soccer and Pokemon Go caused a controversy in Christian communities, and a  bunch of other similar incidents.\n\nSo this is why I ask this question. How come religious people in general-particularly those of conservative background and areas where secularism is not the dominant power- so judgmental towards others for harmless stuff that is not opposed in scripture, but have nothing to do with religion **PERIOD**? In particular why is nerdy hobbies so targeted by the religious as subject of mockery? I'm just talking about sports and other fun-pass times, nevermind fashion, position in social class, and other more serious stuff.\n\nI mean how is reading a volume of Uncanny X-Men or watching an episode of Ranma 1/2 a sign of not being religious and proof you're a manchild? Why should we care if someone (who donates to charity and prays everyday) enters church in casual dress? Does a person's job and social class matter in how devout they are? Really soccer is against the Quran so soccer players should be gunned down? Really dressing up in American Indian pagan dresses (because its Winter and no other suitable clothes are around) means you as a Puritan has renounced his faith and damned to hell?\n\nI ask where this psychology come from since the Bible, Quran, and other holy scriptures not only command to treat others with respect and humans are all loved by God, but there is nothing in these holy books saying an eskimo dress is forbidden to wear or that computer science is forbidden as a job. In particular I don't understand how religious people even take the \"jock, nerd, cheerleader\" high school hierarchy cliche seen in TV and movies even far more seriously than real life jocks especially in their contempt towards nerds (even using religion to justify bullying)!\n",

I don't consider the problem of evil the most comprehensive rebuttal toward the character of God, but it surely demonstrates flaws in the common portrayal. However, I see referring to the very fact such a being has created a realm of separation and torture, for simply unbelief, or false belief, outlines a very cruel depiction, even for what I believe is fictional. I find it morally reprehensible for such a powerful deity to give that level of punishment, for the supposed crime of unbelief. Moreover, any crime at all. An eternity of torment and agony, simply because one followed the wrong faith, or lost faith entirely (assuming the Abrahamic depiction is correct) and is subject to the horrors of eternal damnation. I find that the most compelling point for his immorality. Thoughts? ",

If you need to go outside it, then it's not clear. So when it became apparent that the Bible wasn't clear and after much study I became an atheist.\n\nI still wasn't convinced of my atheism until someone on Facebook, a die hard Christian suggested william Lane Craig to me. William lane Craig's​ \"spirit\" captivated my interest. He seems like an upbeat guy, I genuinely believe he believes what he's saying has merit. I don't think he's doing it for money even though he likes it.\n\nHis approach isn't arrogant to me at least.. He doesn't issue adhominems nor does he try to demonize those who disagree with him. His goal after all, is to  try to convert you (and also be right of course)\n\nThe debates I watched, I felt like William lane Craig \"won\" (some of the won them handily, in my opinion.)\n\nDr. Craig taught me a valuable lesson. Just because you \"win\" a debate or sway the crowd, does not mean your argument is/was valid. I would go to forums and discussion boards such as  Reddit, YouTube, (theoreticalbullshit is a great channel) and various books and find much more elaborate answers that obliterates his arguments.\n\nHe's made me appreciate the philosophical approach to god claim and philosophy in general. Before, philosophy was never my basis for rejecting the god claim. I use to argue against the god claim based on the lack of scientific evidence alone.\n\n***Tl,:Dr william.lane Craig convinced me of my world view and made me appreciate philosophy.***\n\nI genuinely don't know why people hate the guy because he has fallacious arguments.\n\nI feel he's an asset personally to critical thinking. Even if you don't agree with his premise, it makes you curious to view the arguments for each side",

I used to live there for most of my life and studied Chemistry during that period and would often talk to her about how incredible and complicated the Universe is.  She always seemed to take it pretty well and seemed to be very interested (and did really well in her middle and high school science classes with my influence).\n\nI've since left Georgia and don't have that level of influence on her anymore.  She's recently taken to going to Baptist youth groups with her friends (she was raised Anglican) and constantly posting on Facebook about how she's a \"Jesus Freak\" (apparently it is a branded thing now?).  Constantly posting about how her goal is to know God more and come into \"his\" light and what not.  Typical Christian feel-good nonsense.\n\nI want to say something to her.... not to destroy her faith, but to convince her that spending all of her time trying to \"glorify God\" doesn't actually do anything positive for her and that she should refocus her goals and efforts elsewhere.  Problem is, I don't know how to talk to her about this or bring up the subject in a way that won't bolster her faith ([Like this](http://www.patheos.com/blogs/barrierbreaker/why-strong-arguments-from-atheists-tend-to-increase-a-christians-faith/)).\n\nIs there anything I can do or say?  Or am I just going to have to lose her to the \"club\"?\n\nedit:  I should have clarified earlier, that my only real goal is to prevent her from becoming a fundamentalist.  I know that it is pretty much impossible for her to not believe given where she lives and who she is.  I just wish there was something I could do to keep her from falling into the pit of ignorance.",

Then reality hit, I learned Biology, Chemistry, Comparative Literature, I traveled to India and realized that religion is just a story made up by humans to ascribe a purpose or meaning to life. Ever since then my life has been a complete mess. I've lost all passion and desire to do anything, I can't work hard anymore, I see no point in trying to reach my goals. When you rip off the mask and see the true face of the world, it can be a really tough thing. We are all just animals fighting to survive and pass on our DNA. I see no point in living anymore, no point in surviving through the everyday grind just for some fleeting moments of happiness. Sometimes I wish I never went to college and became a priest like my mother wanted me to, maybe that way I could have had a happy normal life. I am afraid I will never be the happy optimistic person I once was...\n\nEDIT: To everyone commenting, thank you so much!

I'm in particular inquisitive of former Christians who are now atheists on how they feel about recent converts who think they won't have to worry about old problems from their former faiths such as a wrathful god, sexism, LGBT issues, and question of morality how a moral god can condemn virtuous pagans.\n\nMany Muslim converts to Christianity I know mainly apostatized from Islam for those specific reasons in above paragraph and some of them expressed regret leaving Islam (and facing disownment from their family). They were so disappointed of just how screwed up Christianity can be and a good number reverted to Islam, left for other religions, or became atheist shortly afterwards.\n\n",

One that emphasizes high moral standards with respect to fellow human beings along with stringent rationality and skeptic inquiry. One that is a viable option for young kids and teens like me who felt abandoned and fearful at a young age because I doubted the crazy religious stories of miracles and \"faith healing\" and had to leave the group of friends my parents had sectioned me into in our local church. \n\nI think the more Atheists that come forward, it will open the floodgates eventually. It seems there are so many people who don't know what they believe but being a proud nonbeliever, much less just not believing in god in the first place, that want nothing more than to feel they've been true to their mind. \n\nSo what are some of the ways we can normalize this proud casting off of religious nonsense and a firm belief in a life without the fear of big brother in the sky? In community groups, public debates, online resources, city and college volunteer groups , etc. ? \n\n\n\n",

That's what really worries me about coming out to them. Another belief, and the main topic, is that my mom is the reincarnation of God and that we must all obey her because she can \"open a portal to hell and throw us in\" if we disobey her. Even my Dad (who beforetime was the authority figure) is scared of her. Some of the hurtful things that she says are that she does not want me accociating with atheists and people of other faiths, and that she (loves God more than any of us). I can't even accociate with my friends anymore, because she says that if we \"befriend those motherfuckers\" that she'll \"decree blasphemy\" and \"throw us in hell\". I converted to Christianity in 2014, and secretly left it in 2015. She also constantly has outbursts like \"I will kill you motherfuckers\" \" I can't wait to kill you sand niggers when my transformation is complete \" and \" I can't wait to burn this whole world\". She keeps trying to shove bible verses down my throat and always brings God into casual conversations. Like how she said \" praise God you won the honor roll\". Bitch, are you high? That was my hard work that helped me win the honor roll, not some sky fairy. The worst thing is that I'll have to live with this nonsense for 5 more years, possibly more. She keeps asking if I read the Bible and I always respond yes (even though I don't) out of fear that she'll resort to getting physical, and I can't stand it. I can't stand living a lie, I just can't bear it. This shit is literally tearing me apart. Does anyone have advice that can help me get through this?",

I was trying to explain to her how christianity has done a good job of staying relevant because it has evolved along with our social and humanitarian standards. As well as keeping up with technology, media and social aspects of the world. \n\nMy wife argues that the Christianity taught today is the same as it was taught since the new testament. And because I'm an atheist I couldn't possibly be more knowledgeable on the subject. I tried giving examples on the church being more lenient on gays, women being vocal in the church, even the changing of church services to become more of a praise service vs a sermon driven one. \n\nAnyways I was wondering if any of you could direct me towards some information on how christianity has evolved over time. I realize the teaches from old to new testament is different but is there anything that points out differences from the new to this point in time. I'm especially curious how it's evolved with the explosion of peoples access to information. \n\nI personally feel that the church changing its own attitudes and positions as a response to society changing theirs is an argument against the validity if religion. But that's hard to argue with someone who doesn't think Christianity has changed. And that is not necessarily what I'm trying to convince her of. Just something I've tried telling her is a reason I'm don't believe in her religion. \n\nI am sure their may be books on this subject but I am looking more for articles. Im not going to convince her to read a book on it but i know I can get her to read a few articles. \n\nLastly I'm not trying to turn her atheist or make a big deal of me being right and her being wrong. I just want to help further a conversation I'm not educated enough to elaborate on. \n\nThank you for any help you can provide.

I get it scientists say things would be very different if they were off by a factor of 10^-55, but do they say this universe would not be possible with such a number? I saw one debate between Sean Carroll and William Lane Craig where he beautifully addressed the teleological argument, but dint spend too much time on the numbers.. I just need to know for sure for inner peace..  \nThanks!",

        "text": "So I have traditionally undertaken the position that it really is no use trying to change the mind of somebody who will not accept evidence of a thing if it contradicts their preexisting beliefs.  So it was quite a surprise when I noticed what appeared to be contemplation of new information by one of my co-workers when discussing religion.\n\nIn line with above, I was not talking religion to convince anybody of anything, instead I was talking about a audio book I was listening too called \"Great Controversies of Early Christianity\" by Bart Erhman and some of the interesting views held by early believers.\n\nWhere it got interesting was when the story of the resurrection came up, I mentioned how Professor Erhman explained that one of the problems with the story was how Jesus body was brought down off the cross.  According to Professor Erhman (whom I believe credible I just put it this way to avoid implying that I have some expertise in the field) the Romans would never allow a body to be removed from the cross.  The whole point of crucifixion was for it to be a humiliating, public display.  Bodies were left on their crosses until they rotted away.  Professor Erhman concludes that it was highly unlikely if not impossible to believe that the Romans would have allowed anybody to remove a crucified body only a day or so after it went up, if ever.\n\nInterestingly, that point seem to cause my co-worker pause.  In fact where I had been receiving essentially standard apologist responses to other issues, on this she stopped and said \"huh...\".\n\nWill it make a difference?  I don't know; honestly I don't care, I'm not out to change anybody's mind.  It was just such a jarring experience though I felt like I needed to share with this audience. ",

        "text": "I'm a christian...I think...I'm a christian, I believe in God but lately I've been listening to different music, going to parties, few weeks ago I would've been into girls in a way that's more feminist, I would somewhat look down on the guys who would just act like \"alpha\" males sorta. I would think me trusting in God would help me. \n\nI've had social anxiety for a long time ever since I graduated high school and I was more christian. I would put everyone before me, I would avoid lusting by thinking I'll wait till marriage and i'd be fine settling down. I still somewhat think that now but really I just want to work, go to school &amp; party. I've been depressed for a long time and this new mindset of \"not giving a fuck\" has been helping me gradually improve. Of course, I still do HELP people, I still care but I would always try to walk in Jesus footsteps by being selfless and all. \n\nI've tried going the God route, hell I posted something similar to this on /r/christian. I can't tell if i'm close to losing my faith. I do believe in Jesus, I want to believe in Jesus but i'm told by christians i'm \"walking in the flesh\" yet it's hard not to when my social life is expanding, i'm meeting so many people especially international people who don't really care about religion, even my muslims friends still party. But I've tried expanding my christian social group and they end up being fake and more judgemental. To be honest, I even feel like the christians i've met lately have judged me more on my looks or little behaviors than any non christian. I've tried to give these people a chance but the problem is, they don't give me a chance. Yet that trans person will accept me, that stoner will accept me, that atheist will accept me, that muslim will accept me, that student from a 3rd world country will accept me, that student from a culture filled with \"fakeness\" &amp; emotional suppression will accept me. The one Christian group i've found the most Christ like behavior from is the Mormons, to the point I can't sincerely believe they would be going to hell. \n\nAnyways, my point is i'm wondering if anyone has ever been in a situation like this because I'm at a point where I'd love to believe in God, my life is not even too bad atm but i'm still told i'm sinning &amp; when I try to bring myself around \"Christians\" they shut me down. Maybe it's because I admit I'm a sinner, most christians do but I do so in a way that I will admit I cherry pick the bible and use a lot of verses for my own gain but then get insulted because that's against the bible according to a verse that contradicts the one that I mentioned, thus almost proving my point. \n\nHonestly, it's hard, I love helping people &amp; being christ like but I like being selfish sometimes, I want to be able to be myself. But i'm not allowed too, yet i'm also not allowed to LIE but isn't being something your not a lie? So in the end, am I doomed? \n\n\nSorry if none of this makes sense, I'll delete it in a bit, I just had to post something relating to my experiences &amp; see if anyone relates even in slightest. It seems like with Christianity people point out what's wrong with you and not what's good about you. They point your sins &amp; you can say, \"YES  I KNOW!!!\" but they will insist that you DON'T know and never reflect on their own beliefs. ",

        "text": "You pull into the church parking lot with your family. A smiling traffic director motions you into a spot close to the entrance. As you approach the doors, the cheery greeters engage the automatic door opening function and usher you inside. You traverse the walkway toward the sanctuary, passing the two-story Noah's Ark playset and the three-story slide-and-ball-pit extravaganza across the hall. You opt out of your customary London Chai Latte (prepared with authentic Chilean beans in a state-of-the-art coffee roaster), instead approaching the information desk to acquire a copy of the head pastor's new book. You mingle with friends in the acoustically perfect sanctuary, then rise for worship when the countdown clock begins. The setlist consists of Hillsong, Bethel, and a song from your church's latest EP. You watch a catchy/quirky announcements video, where you are thanked for your \"faithfulness\" in giving and encouraged to continue \"serving God's kingdom\" by dropping your weekly contribution into the collection box. The head pastor takes the stage, proceeding to weave an entertaining anecdotal tale into a 25-minute sermon consisting of three supporting Bible verses and a refrain that crests with the accompaniment of a piano at the climax. The altar call ensues, and then an assistant pastor high-fives the lead pastor as he exists stage right. You are encouraged to \"be faithful in your tithes and offering\" and implored to be the \"light of God\" in your community during the upcoming week.  \n\nAs a Christian who grew up in an evangelical environment, nothing in that experience would have been out of the ordinary. In fact, I described a typical service at my family's church. It took me many years to realize just how *orchestrated* the entire show was.  \n\nHere's the real story:  \n\nThe parking lot attendants and entrance greets attend training classes, where they are taught hand-shake technique and appropriate lines of greeting. The extravagant play areas in the church were designed and approved by church leadership, sans any congregational input. The coffee shop was envisioned as the \"social hub\" of the new &amp;-million church building, and to that end appropriate furnishings were implemented, including a $20,000 coffee roaster for premium coffee quality. The lead pastor released a book because all of his lead pastor buddies around the country already did so. The worship pastor is the lead pastor's son, who returned home after a failed CCM career in Nashville. He wrote all the songs on the latest worship album, which sold precisely zero copies to non-church members. Each church service adheres to a strict mold, with each segment following strict timing allocations. Worship consists of four songs, and lasts for a duration of 20 minutes. Announcements account for 5 minutes, and the sermon accounts for 25 minutes. At the \"two-minute warning\", a worship team member takes the stage to provide the backing piano track as the head pastor approaches the zenith of his discourse and transitions into his carefully rehearsed salvation sales pitch. Every car in the parking lot is counted. Every head in the sanctuary is counted. The administration tracks each member's financial contributions for \"tax break purposes\".  \n\nOf course, not a single pastor attended seminary or any form of graduate education. More than half obtained business/marketing degrees, and transitioned out of the \"corporate world\" after hearing the \"calling of God\" on their life. The church employs an extensive array of background personnel, from audio technicians to graphic designers to \"life group coordinators\". Three oversight elders \"govern\" the church and provide counsel to the lead pastor. Two of these elders were college buddies with said pastor, and the other is the head pastor of a 5,000-member church where he mentored the lead pastor 15 years ago. The church just completed their new $7-million addition. The requisite funds were acquired in a three-part, two-year fundraising effort, in which members were encouraged to \"press into God\" so as to ascertain the \"part you are to play in advancing God's kingdom\". To that end, members were counseled to consider forgoing vacations, cutting cable, drawing from retirement funds, or donating stock and/or real estate. To celebrate the grand opening, a \"special offering\" was taken to \"celebrate God's work in the kingdom and the city\". Leadership adamantly refuses to divulge financial dealings to its members; the extent of the information provided consists of quarterly \"baptism and salvation\" tallies, and a summary of charitable giving, which allegedly comprises 10% of the church budget.  \n\nLook, I'm not accusing anyone of being corrupt, or intentionally misleading/manipulating people. I like to think the best of others, and I like to assume that this church is run like a business because its pastors don't know anything different. Nonetheless, I experience considerable frustration when its members adamantly insist that its success is a manifestation of \"God's hand moving\". No, they just happen to be led by formerly successful businessmen, now adhering to a proven church-building model.  \n\nFor those formerly (or currently!) involved in ministry, what were the decision making processes that led to churches like this? How does the leadership rationalize the success of what seems to clearly be a successful human business model? What are the methods behind the madness? Why the analytics? Why the carefully crafted worship experiences? Why the meticulously planned and orchestrated giving campaigns?  \n\nSurely, pastors and church employees must be aware, at least subliminally, how very *human* their successes are. Right?  \n\n**TL;DR:** Churches build their businesses with explicitly secular techniques. Are they aware of this? What is the underlying \"science\" of church building?  \n\n[If you want to rage, watch this \"uplifting\" video of the head pastor describing his private dinners with sharehol...er, \"high-capacity givers\"](https://youtu.be/xicsRkWsWY4?t=94)\n",

The MRI scan had revealed bulging disks and a deteriorated lower spine. Needless to say she has had a terrible week waiting on the scan analysis and doctor recommendations.\n\nSo as I stand there in the pharmacy I turn to look at product for sale in the store and notice a lot of Xtian oriented merchandise. My eyes fixate on a nearby rotating rack of greeting cards and one card in particular captures my attention. The card reads on the outside \"Why the pain?\" As pain is the entire reason I am there I figure my curiosity about this particular card's wording warrants further investigation.\n\nThe inside of this card attempts to provide an explanation as to why god allows we poor earthlings to endure pain in all it's various forms. It actually stated that in order to fully \"appreciate\" the wonderful sunshine that god bestows upon us each day we have to be subjected to pain to enable a deeper understanding of the love he/she bestows upon us.\n\nIn my humble opinion these godly cards are a profound bunch of bullshit. It's similar to the comment Mother Teresa once said: \"Pain is a blessing from God!\"\n\nThere is nothing noble or character building about pain, it simply sucks when we have the misfortune to experience it.

It's not the worst state to live in but it's also not the best.\n\nI questioned the existence of God ever since I was 12 but didn't become an Atheist until I was 15. I also learned very quickly that if I wanted to fit in around my peers and adults I would have to keep some of my opinions to myself.\n\nIt didn't really bother me as a kid, I just figured it is what it is. I had plenty of social media options to help quench my social thirst.\n\nI recently became an ordained minister of Secular Humanism and it got me thinking about how I didn't share my opinions or questions as a child growing up. It never gave me a chance to meet and talk with other people with the same mentality. \n\nIt didn't make me bitter but It made me feel a little lonely. There's a branch of my brain that I can't share with people around me face to face because I know how quickly word spreads in little towns and I know how Hoosiers like to treat people who are different.\n\nThen it got me thinking about how many people I know that might be hungry for the same answers I wanted but couldn't ask them for the same reason I couldnt. It makes me want to find these people and talk to them.\n\nI don't know what point I'm trying to make, I feel like I'm starting to ramble.

We immediately developed a rapoir, revealing my skeptical nature about all things supernatural, and she was fine with my position.\n\nI have been making, as a woodworker, everything from pentagram altar tables, rune sets, Tarot card holders, crystal laden staffs, wands, to ceremonial candle holders.\n\n She has been very open with me about her paganism and the stuff I have learned thus far is fascinating. Paganism is a highly developed form of worship and there is nothing superficial about it. \n\nShe also makes her own incense and bath salts/powders; some of which smell fantastic! Two of her salts go by the names \"Orgasm\" and \"F**k Yeah.\"\n\nDuring my latest visit to her shop we got into a conversation about amulets and pendants. She offers these pendants that customers can use to house anything like hair or body fluids. People actually use these to put semen or menstrual fluids in and then will swing them in a circular back and forth motion to receive a yes or no answer as to whether their lover is cheating on them. \n\nWe've conversed about spells and how some can take a year or more to complete. And her pagan library is quite extensive as well. She's a certified instructor in some type of witchcraft.\n\nNormally I cannot reveal my atheistic worldview with shop owners and customers as it has an obvious negative impact on business opportunities. In my area of the U.S. word spreads fast through the religious grapevine.\n\nSo I just wanted to share some of what I have learned about paganism. It's both bizarre and kind of cool in an odd way. If anyone else has pagan acquaintances/friends I'd be interested to hear your experiences. \n\nPeace,\n\nBra",

        "text": "A common problem experienced by many, in all debates and conversations, whether political or personal or religious, is the fact that some people just won't listen and won't accept anything you say. It's obviously very difficult and it can be quite infuriating, so I'm going to try and explain why this is such and take a somewhat different and slightly sympathetic approach. I do not think it is fair to simple label all people to stick rigidly to their beliefs as ignorant and stupid - there are reasons for this, as I will explore.\n\nThis post is going to touch briefly on falsification and the work of Antony Flew, so I want to firstly set up the context. The example which I will share shortly of the Parable of the Lunatic is part of a \"University Debate\" between four scholars arguing over whether religious language is meaningless. Flew proposed that it was, because religious believers would always \"shift the goalposts\" of their beliefs and so avoid any chance of their being wrong - of their claim being falsified. This in turn would water down their original claim so much that God would die a \"death by a thousand qualifications\" and bear no resemblance to their original claim. He used the example of two explorers in a jungle.\n\n&gt; Once upon a time two explorers came upon a clearing in the jungle. In the clearing were growing many flowers and many weeds. One explorer says, \"Some gardener must tend this plot.\" The other disagrees, \"There is no gardener.\" So they pitch their tents and set a watch. No gardener is ever seen. \"But perhaps he is an invisible gardener.\" So they set up a barbed-wire fence. They electrify it. They patrol with bloodhounds. (For they remember how H. G. Well's The Invisible Man could be both smelt and touched though he could not be seen.) But no shrieks ever suggest that some intruder has received a shock. No movements of the wire ever betray an invisible climber. The bloodhounds never give cry. Yet still the Believer is not convinced. \"But there is a gardener, invisible, intangible, insensible, to electric shocks, a gardener who has no scent and makes no sound, a gardener who comes secretly to look after the garden which he loves. At last the Sceptic despairs, \"But what remains of your original assertion? Just how does what you call an invisible, intangible, eternally elusive gardener differ from an imaginary gardener or even from no gardener at all?\"\n\nAs we can see, the religious believer is simply changing their beliefs according to the questioner. This is one part of the problem, and the \"why\" is what I will explore next. We are all familiar with the first example.\n\nIn response to Flew, R.M. Hare created the concept of a 'blik'; that is, an un-verifiable, un-falsifiable belief which forms the central part of one's identity and world view. A blik is so central to someone's way of life that it is often very painful to see it challenged, and we return to our evolutionary fight-or-flight response when we feel that our 'blik' is being attacked. Bliks can take many forms; belief in God, no belief in God, a hatred of tomato sauce, etc. The point is that we all have them and they are all central to who we are.\n\nHare used the parable of the lunatic to counter Flew. \n\n&gt; A certain lunatic is convinced that all dons [university professors] want to murder him.  His friends introduce him to all the mildest and most respectable dons that they can find, and after each of them has retired, they say, 'You see, he doesn't really want to murder you; he spoke to you in a most cordial manner; surely you are convinced now?' But the lunatic replies, 'Yes, but that was only his diabolical cunning; he's really plotting against me the whole time, like the rest of them; I know it I tell you'. However many kindly dons are produced, the reaction is still the same.\n\nSo we can see here that despite overwhelming evidence that the professors don't want to kill him, the core belief that they are out to get him remains intact. Nothing they say will ever make him change his mind, because his world-view is built around the idea that the professors want to kill him, and to lose that world-view means to, essentially, lose your identity.\n\nI know that some people won't agree with me, but I'm coming from a position of trying to understand why people think the way they do. I certainly, when I was a Christian, was guilty of everything above, because my core blik and world-view was built around the idea of God and it was painful and enraging to have that world-view attacked and (shock horror!) entertain the possibility that perhaps God wasn't real. I would not listen or accept anything that atheists would say to me, because it would be too painful and I would prefer to remain comforted by my own opinions. I suppose the same could be said for atheists, too.\n\nSo what am I trying to say? I am saying that we should take a somewhat compassionate approach in the sense that if someone is being aggressive to you or not accepting valid criticisms, don't take it personally. You're just activating their blik defense mechanism.",
