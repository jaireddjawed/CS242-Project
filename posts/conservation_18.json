        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/conservation/comments/8igzdn/lower_birth_rate_lower_human_population_more_land/",
        "text": "Based on the title, it seems like humans having a lower birth rate (the current scenario) should be a good thing. In most of the world, the population replacement level is still above 2.0 but there are some places like Europe where the population replacement levels are low. This gives the impression for some that there could be more land for wildlife to reclaim in the future, however most people are saying that the declining birth rate is a very bad thing. To deal with the low birth rate issue, some European countries are importing migrants from Asia (mainly Western Asia) and Africa to counteract the low birth rate of Europeans.\n\nSo is the territorial range for wildlife never going to expand, especially in places like Europe where the population of humans is decreasing each day? While the human population is decreasing in Europe, Europe is trying to stop this by importing humans from elsewhere since economists are claiming that a lower population is hurting European industries. Europe is currently overpopulated by global standards and has one of the highest population densities in the world, so it having a population decline seems like it should be returning to the natural order of things, but several European governments think that this decline is a very bad thing and are importing migrants from outside Europe (and even other parts of Europe) to cope with this issue and are trying to keep Europe at its current population. Its not only Europe, but other overpopulated places (e.g. Japan, South Korea) that are experiencing a period where their lands are undergoing a population decline, but see this as a bad thing as it would hurt the industries and economy over there.\n\nCould conservationists take advantage of the current population decline in different industrial parts of the world and use those lands to expand wildlife territorial ranges and bring in animals? Or are industries going to continue expanding with a sustained need for a high human population?\n\nBy the way, I may have said some wrong stuff, so try to not be too harsh on this post. I'm just a layman stating what I think and looking for feedback from other conservationist perspectives on the current birth declining global trend.",

I'm obsessed with nature and conservation and would be happy to help protect it. \nI understand that the working as a Conservation Officer isn't always the greatest but I think it will be rewarding knowing that I'm making the world a better place. \nMy question is: What should my next steps be? Would I need to go back to school to get a second degree in criminal justice or environmental science? or is there a certification I could get instead? \nI'm already in a lot of debt and would rather not go back for a 2nd degree if theres an alternative. \nI hope theres someone out there that can help me out.\nThank you.
