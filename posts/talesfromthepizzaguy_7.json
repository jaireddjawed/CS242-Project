        "text": "I’ve been a driver for about five years now, this story is one of my favorites to tell. It takes place back when I first started and is one hundred percent true. \n\nIt was late at night but it was dark out, my managers have always told me if it looks sketchy call them first. This place was the definition of sketchy, it was a less than reputable district in town. \n\nThe house had shutters falling off of it, the paint was chipped and faded it needed at least a quarter ton of paint to make it even somewhat presentable. Along with that there was trash galore in the yard and the yard itself was overflowing with weeds and tall grass, sketchy.\n\nSo, I have this little move that is irrational and would probably never work in a real situation. If I am ever concerned about getting robbed, I put the pizza in my right hand and prepare to throw it and run away. Like I said, completely irrational and would likely never work, but that’s my move.\n\nSo I knock on the door prepared to potentially blast this guy in the face with his pizza and haul ass hoping he doesn’t have a gun. \n\nThe guy answers the door, but he only cracks it an inch or so. Since I’ve been a driver a while it’s not uncommon for someone to answer the door this way, but I was only on my second month there so it freaked me out. \n\n“Hey man, did you order pizza?” An objectively stupid question but I didn’t know what else to say. \n\nHe slowly cracks the door even more, now it’s at maybe four inches. The weird thing was this guy was holding his arm horizontally at a ninety degree angle with his body. So all I’m thinking is they guy is going to kill me, he has a gun or something behind the door.\n\n“Yea man I ordered food, how much was it?”\n\n“Yea...uh...it’s 22.50.” \n\n“Okay, give me just a second.” He days and he slowly opens the door more to where I can see him better now. He didn’t look particularly menacing but he did have a meth-head vibe about him.\n\nWith the arm I can see, because the other arm is still behind the door held out, he reaches for his money. He finally opens the door all the way and I see what was on his arm. It was a fucking falcon. And this bird is shooting daggers into my eyes, he briefly looked into my soul and felt nothing but a loathing sensation for me. That’s what it felt like at least. All I could think to say was, \n\n“Is that...is that a falcon.”\n\nAnd with an air of nonchalantness usually only reserved for James Bond he says,\n\n“Yea, I’m a falconer.”\n\n“Cool.”\n\nHe gave me the money and I gave him his pizza and then I left. Now I know that it’s not a great story but I tell it because it makes me laugh that someone can be so nonchalant about an occupation/hobby that has not been relevant in hundreds of years. That’s like talking to someone today and they say,\n\n“Yea I saved up all year being a chimney sweep while being an elevator operator on weekends to go on a big game safari and kill some big game animals.” \n\nThat was the level of weird that this guy was on.

        "text": "[Prologue](https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromThePizzaGuy/comments/8gfza7/the_rise_and_fall_of_ghetto_pizza_my_time_as_an/)\n\nI wanted to keep this chronological, but this is a story I've wanted to tell here for a while.  It's most likely why I quit in the first place.  And while all the other stories are rattling around in my brain I remember this one clear as day.\n\nIt was a slow Monday night in November around 7PM.  I had just done a drawer drop on my front counter and dispatch registers and stepped into the back to get a head start on dough.  I was honestly overstaffed, which never happened.  I had 3 drivers on the road, 1 in the store, 2 cooks, and a CSR and was thinking about who to cut when one of my cooks, a 17 year old black girl ran past with a vacant look on her face.\n\n\"What's up, Dee?\" I asked her.\n\n\"They're inside.\"\n\nI remember exactly what she said, because I had no idea what it meant.  Who's they?  Ecosure?  Our District Manager?  Because her face showed no emotion I figured the worst that was happening was a surprise audit or something.  Once I peeked my head around the corner and saw 2 black teenagers with hoodies and bandanas over their faces carrying guns I realized her face was void of emotion because of terror.  She just shut down.\n\nThe two kids pushed us to the back tried to grab my CSR, another 17 year old black girl who was friends with Dee.  I stepped forward and one of the guys pointed his gun at my face.\n\n\"I'm the manager.  If you are trying to get money, I'm the person who can open the registers.\"\n\nThe two talked it over and pulled me up front.  There I saw another two guys, one holding what I would later find out to be an AR-15.\n\nHe's the one who did most of the talking.  He instructed me to open the first register, which we only used on weekends.  I went to punch in my numbers to open the drawer and he pushed me against the speed rack.\n\n\"What the fuck are you doing, man?\" he screamed at me.  I realized I was going to have to explain every movement I made to these guys unless I wanted it, or something worse, to happen again.\n\n\"The registers open through the computer.  I have to put in my code, and then click on a button on the screen to open them.  This drawer isn't used, and it doesn't have any money in it, but I can open them all anyway.\"\n\n\"Just hurry up and fucking do it, man.\"\n\nI remember he called me, man, a lot.  The first register took a couple of tries.  I normally use the keyboard instead of the screen, but my hands were shaking enough that I couldn't type them in.\n\n\"I'm going to use the screen instead of the keyboard because the buttons are bigger.\"\n\n\"Just fucking do it.\"\n\nLike I said, the drawer was empty.  As I was being moved to the next drawer one of my drivers came in the side door.  He walked over to his box completely oblivious to the situation and started to try and push a wad of cash though the slot.  The guy without the rifle ran over and grabbed him, and made him open his box.  My driver dropped his keys at this point.  He called for the other two to bring everyone up front and made my other driver open his as I opened the other drawers.\n\nAs I said in the beginning, I'd just done cash drops.  1s, 5s, and change were the only things in the register.  Less than a hundred and fifty bucks between the two.  They got more out of the driver boxes than the registers.\n\n\"Open the safe.\"  The guy with the AR-15 said.\n\n\"It's on a 10 minute time delay.  I'll enter the code, but I can't open it faster than that.\"\n\n\"Open the fucking safe, now, man.\"\n\nI typed in the numbers on my second try.  The clock started to count down.\n\n\"Do you see this number, I can't open it until it reaches 10:00.\"\n\n\"Open the fucking safe now, motherfucker.\"\n\n\"I ca...\"\n\n\"10, 9, 8, open it motherfucker.\"\n\nI shook the handle, hoping it would either make them realize I couldn't do anything, or that it would magically open.\n\n\"7, 6, 5.\"\n\n\"I really can't open it yet.\"\n\n\"4, 3, 2...I will kill you\"\n\n\"Please don't\" It was the only thing I could think to say.\n\n\"Just shoot him in the head.\" the other guy that was up front the whole time said.  I can still here him saying that when I think about this.\n\n\"1...zero.\"  And he poked me in the back of the head with the barrel.  When I felt it I though he did shoot me for a split second.  Then I heard him laughing.  He thought it was the funniest thing in the world.  His sick laugh lasted for what felt like forever.  He pulled me up and made me empty my wallet.  I had a 20.  The two that pulled everyone up front started to make the others do the same.  My other cook, a methhead lookalike refused and got the butt of a gun upside his head.\n\n\"Dude, stop.  Give him your money.\"  My cook listened to me and handed it over.\n\nThe four realized they had everything they could get.  One of them was trying to grab all the quarters out of my dispatch drawer.  The rifle guy decided there was an easier way.\n\n\"Hey, I'm just gonna take the whole fucking thing,\" he said as he grabbed the tray.  Again, he thought he was the funniest guy on the planet and I had to hear that fucking laugh again.\n\nThe four of them ran out the front door to a white Rav-4 they had parked across the parking lot.  Methcook ran to the front door while I ran to the side door and we locked the store down.  I sat down at the manager desk and called 911.  That's when I saw the four of them run back to the door and try and open it.  When it didn't they started to hit it.\n\nThe police dispatcher came on and I told her we were robbed and they were trying to break back into the store.\n\n\"Where are you located.\"\n\nI gave her the address.  I head a gun go off.  Three of them were now kicking and body checking the door.\n\n\"They're trying to break back in.\"\n\n\"Sir is there some...\"\n\n\"They're in.\"  I said and dropped the phone.  One of them finally managed to kick the front of the door in.  I watched on the security camera as he leapt over the bar and into the store, face first into one of our wooden benches.  He hopped the counter and grabbed the keys that my driver had dropped, hopped over the counter again, and sped off in my driver's car.\n\nI have to give credit to the KCPD, for once they actually responded quickly.  Before I could call my RGM 3 squad cars were in our parking lot.  They secured the area and took statements while I talked to my RGM and then Area Manager.\n\nBig boss showed up before boss.  At this point in time I still had everything together.  I was still worried about my crew.  We sat out in the cold in our tee-shirts while the police started to gather evidence in the store.  I saw the two girls shivering so I started up my Mini Cooper and told them to get inside.  My drivers got into their cars to keep warm.  Methcook, big boss, and I talked out in the cold.  I must have smoked half a pack of cigarettes in that 45 minutes.  My RGM shows up and he and big boss are called in to go over the security camera with the police.\n\nThe rest of the night, and honestly the next few days are a bit of a blur.  We had to stay and clean up the store, prep for the next morning, and all that jazz, which I feel was kind of a dick thing to make us do.  Some door guy showed up and screwed a big-ass piece of plywood over where the glass should have been.  The gunshot I heard earlier was one of the kids shooting himself in the hand.  He apparently was using the butt of his gun to try and smash the window in, which caused it to discharge through the middle of his hand like stigmata.  Big Boss told us this thinking it would make us laugh and lighten the mood with how stupid the guy was.  All it did was reiterate the fact that I had a gun to the back of my head, and these four jackasses were so careless that one of them shot himself.  That could have been any one of us in the store.  The four of them then drove to the closest hospital where they were immediately arrested and admitted to the whole thing.\n\nWe finished cleaning up and the RGM and I counted down the cash from the safe.  They ended up getting $220 from the store.  I finally got home around midnight.\n\nI worked the next day, Tuesday, but the RGM stayed the entire time and basically had me work make table, which I am thankful for.  I was off Wednesday, but had to be back Thursday.\n\nThursday is when it hit.  My RGM was still trying to ease my back in, but a former driver showed up and he stepped out to talk to him.  My CSR for the night had stepped into the bathroom and I took over the front counter.  I was standing in front of the safe, looking at the plywood door, and in my head hearing, \"Just shoot him in the head,\" on repeat when a guy with a hoodie walked through the door.  I remember telling him someone would be out shortly.  I thought I walked outside and told Boss that we needed him inside.  I guess what I actually did was punch the door three times, tell him, \"fuck you I quit.\" and started to walk to my car.  He calmed me down and gave me the number to corporate's crisis helpline. \n\nBefore the robbery I was cocky.  That was my store.  I spent at least 50, if not 60 or more hours a week there.  I was *the* closing manager.  Half the time I'd send my closing cook and driver home after the last run and make was flipped and do the remaining dishes, dough, and paperwork myself, alone in the store with headphones in.  I felt just as safe there as I did at home.  In one night it ruined that security for me forever.\n\nI tried to be \"a man\" and turned down counseling for 48 hours until that outburst.  I acted like it wasn't a big deal.  But it was.  It took months for me not to get a quiver in my leg when I saw a young black kid with a hoodie.  And I hated myself for even thinking that.  I was lucky in the fact that they sent me to an incredible counselor, Burt, a black guy a bit younger than me that explained that I didn't become racist overnight, that the fight or flight reflex would kick in when I saw something that triggered the experience, like a young black guy in a hoodie, until I worked through the experience.  I knew we would get along when the \"calming music\" he had in the background was the Chrono Trigger Brink of Time album.\n\nBut even with counseling, the cockiness never came back.  Any stress I had from a shift I was able to leave in the car on the drive back from work.  I started to hate the job.  I knew it was the beginning of the end.  I'd never truly feel in charge of the store after that, I felt like an outsider.  For the next 6 months I dreaded the drive into work every time I got into the car.  If my tolerance for bullshit was an HP bar, mine just got cut in half.",

        "text": "EDIT - This is a story from about 10 years ago. \n\nThis is a tale of what rightfully should have been a 3 hour day, nice tip in the pocket and that would have been that. But sadly, this was not that.\n\nIt was a Saturday morning at 6:30am as we opened the store super early for a 250 pizza order that was due at 9am. 250 pies spread out across many different specialties and two topping combinations. Typical warehouse lunch for a large crew on a Saturday. My GM, one insider, another driver and myself blazed through the prep, building, and logistics phase with no issues. We were all veterans of this store, and were a well oiled machine. \n\nA couple hours later, we're packing our two cars with the last few hot bags and gathering the accouterments one would normally take - Plates, CRP, Parm, etc and getting ready to hit the road. \n\nAs I climbed into the driver seat of my 2004 Tiburon GT, attempting to see through the steamed up windows, I did my final check for a pen, the receipt and ensured we had the address correct. Everything was golden and I led the way, our other driver in tow with our vehicles maxed out, carrying 2/3 of the order. A second trip for one of us was of no consequence given the distance back to the store and the time it would take to set up the first wave in a customer friendly manner. \n\nWe arrived, and began unloading our vehicles, focusing first on the other driver as he was slated to make the run for the last bit of the order. As we get the last of the pizzas unloaded from the cars, we touch base and as he takes off to the store to get the remaining pies, I finish up with the staging. \n\nOh the staging - and let me say that everything we did from the beginning of the morning until now was to allow this to happen smoothly; it was a logistical masterpiece. Any veteran driver knows what I am talking about, but with 15 different types of pizza and all kinds of sides, drinks etc... you have to work these like your catering. Everything sorted by type, in a way that works with a line of people; standard stuff. \n\nThe point is, this was a clinic in the art of the large delivery order.\n\n\nThe other drive arrives back with the remaining pizzas and we get them set up, allowing the client to open the doors to their lunch event 5 minutes early. As we were waiting for the lady in charge to come over to sign for everything, we looked at one another with absolute confidence that we were going to do very well. \n\n$1700 ticket, with an amazing customer experience from front to back? Surely this was in the bag. \n\nShe walks up and very pleasantly asked, \"Hey guys! Thanks so much, do you have anything for me to fill out?\" \n\n\nI hand over the paperwork, uncapped pen on top, oriented so that it was facing her. This so that she would have to expend minimal effort to sign the receipt. \n\n\n\"We just need the top one, the bottom two are for you, ma'am.\" I said, as I had a thousand times before.\n\n\nShe smiles and signs the receipt, folding it in half before handing it back. Classy move, I respect it. \n\n\nAs I thank her and turn to leave, I meet my compatriot at the door as he finishes loading the empty hot-bags into our cars.\n\n\nWe wait until the door shuts behind us and unfold the slip to see how the gods were smiling upon us. After all, it was now ~10am on a Saturday and we were both looking forward to having the rest of the day off with a nice chunk of change in our respective pockets.\n\nYou know on cheesy sitcoms, something crazy happens and you hear that record stop sound. That's exactly what happened, everything stopped as we gazed at not only....a normal zero in that tip line. It was the dreaded zero WITH the slash through it. Complete with a \"Thank you! :)\" written off to the side. \n\n\nWe return back to the store, livid as one would expect. Our GM and insider were finishing up cleaning and getting ready to open for actual business stop what they were doing to ask us what the hell happened. I suppose it was written on our faces. \n\n\nOur manager, was also super pissed. He ended up giving us each ~15 % on that ticket out of his own pocket and then he also refused to do orders before business hours for that place for the remainder of the time that store was open. He also gave us the rest of the day off. \n\n\nAll in all, it was a pretty good day.\n\n\nTL;DR - got stiffed on a $1700 order outside of business hours, on a corporate card and my boss ended up hooking us up out of his pocket. \n\n  ",

        "text": "Customers will always have pets. Some will say to call their phone to avoid setting them off. Some let them run loose in the neighborhood, and the dog follows you around while you're doing the delivery. Most times, the customer slams the door on the dog and does the transaction outside. Whatever, I can tolerate that. \n\nWhat I can't stand are the people who make no effort to keep the dog away from you. Yeah, yeah, he's friendly, but I'm trying to make change here, so don't let him jump up and try to lick my face. (People like this always want exact change.) Some people leave their dogs on the front walkway, and he starts barking as soon as you enter their property. It's always a fight to get to the door without pissing it off even more. These people never tip, and try to scam free food from the store by claiming I jostled the bag, which is actually the dog's fault when he was pawing at it.\n\nMy most annoying dog story just happened today, and I'm still infuriated. I had just finished a delivery with no issues, and they tipped $3, which is better than I usually get in that neighborhood.  I pulled off and turned around, and while I'm driving back down the road, two dogs, a big dog and a small dog, came charging at my ride and I had to slam the brakes. They did not belong to any customer I've delivered to on that street, and there is no owner in sight. The dogs are barking like crazy, and I know there's no way I'm going to get to move without getting rid of them. Problem is, I can't see the little dog from inside the car, and I'd rather not get fired for running over some guy's dog. So I got out and looked to see where the dogs are, then I lured them to the back of the car, jumped back in, and floored it, and the dogs kept chasing me as long as they were able. A driver for another company passed me while I was leaving, and then he got stopped by the dogs, so at least I wasn't the only one having a bad day. I passed that driver again later and he flipped me off, so we're even now. \n\nAnother time, I had a dog follow me when I was delivering to a duplex up a hill, and while I was waiting for the customer to not answer the door (I ultimately had to call twice), the dog got mad the pizza wasn't for him and started barking loudly. And it's a big black dog, too. As I said, the customer wasn't answering the bell, and there was no point in knocking on the door or calling with the dog barking because no one could hear anything, so I had to wait for the customer's neighbor to come out and chase it off before I could finish up. Not worth the 9 cent tip. ",

        "text": "My friends have been recommending to me a local Mom-and-Pop place for ages. It's near a movie theater. Last Thursday, when I went to see Infinity War, I grabbed dinner there beforehand -- My first time trying the place. I loved it, and when I went to see IW again two days later with friends, we ate there before the movie, too.\n\nToday, at home, my roommate and I both had very long days, and on top of that he's coming down with a nasty fever, so we decided to order out and I thought I'd order from this place, so my roommate could try it out. I'm in kind of a pissy mood over dumb shit from my own job and he's in a pretty pissy mood 'cuz he hasn't been this sick in literally years. I figured it'd at least make for a nice end to the day if instead of either of us having to cook, we ordered food from a new place that we already knew made very good food.\n\nWe ordered at 8:15PM for a delivery, and the place closes at 9:00PM. We were told the delivery would be here \"in 45 minutes or less.\" It hits 9:30PM and our food still hasn't arrived, so I dialed the place fully aware that they were already closed but regardless hoping on the off-chance that someone might see the number associated with the order and pick up. Like most places, they didn't have a voicemail, so it just kept ringing. I let it go for a solid 3 and a half minutes, figuring that if someone was still there maybe they'd at least pick up out of annoyance or something.\n\nAt that point, I gave up, and started ranting to my roommate in the other room. \"What the fuck is this shit, we paid $30 for our order, they're 30 minutes late, I have no way to contact them,\" etc. Smack in the middle of a sentence, my phone rings and I pick up. \"Hey, I've got your food.\" I tell him I'll be right out, and in my mind I'm already beginning to format my \"unsatisfied customer speech,\" in case I have to use it after asking what happened and getting a dodgy response or something. I open the door and he doesn't even let me say anything -- he goes straight to, \"Hey, I'm sorry we're so late. We were swamped and fell behind after our new guy accidentally burned an order, and since the guys were all tired I thought I'd just bring it myself.\" That threw me off -- \"Wait -- What do you mean, are you the owner?\" \"Yeah, hey! Nice to meet you, I'm Eddie.\" (*No, that's not his real name.*)\n\nMy mind did a 180. Hold on, that's something else. I like this guy. Wow. \"Oh, oh wow, thank you. That's totally fine, I understand. Wow, I have to say, you've really made an impression on us. This was our first time ordering a delivery and this was not what I expected after a really late arrival.\" He smiles, looks at the receipt, sees we paid with a card, and says, \"You're all set, have a great night!\" I go, \"Wait, hold on, let me tip you!\" \"No way! No, there's absolutely no need. Have a great night.\"\n\nColor us impressed.\n\nTL;DR: Order delivery from a local hole-in-the-wall for the first time ever, we're told it's going to take 45 minutes and it arrived over 30 minutes after that. I was ready to give the driver a justifiably annoyed chat, assuming I received the BS reason for why the order was late that I expected to. Instead, the driver starts by apologizing for the tardiness, and drops a subtle hint that he's the owner. I pick up on it and ask to clarify, and he explains that everyone was tired and so he decided to bring the order in himself so his guys could go home. We're very impressed, I wanted to tip him generously, but he flat-out refused it and insisted there was no need. He walked off before I could argue further.",

        "text": "It was the early summer of 2014. I returned to my local Pizza Hut for my summer job as a delivery job that I had held the summer before. Absolutely loved the job, spending a good majority of your time cranking some music and driving around town and making good pay, couldn't be better. Anyway, on this particular night in May, I endured a perfect storm. I had a customer pay in exact change which I had to count out, I'd gotten stiffed around 3 times, forgot soda twice, and one of the other drivers messed up and took an order I was suppose to get and ended up with a 50 dollar tip. I'm usually pretty good at keeping my cool, but its safe to say I was on the edge after all that. \n\nWe get a call for two pizzas to a new place. No big deal, nothing weird about it, it was one of our online deals. Get there quickly and as I am pulling the receipts out I notice that it asks for me to come around to the back. The Pizza Hut I work at has a policy where you can't go around to the back so I call the guy to let him know that on my personal cell. The guy, we'll call him D, answers and says 'Hello' in a fairly stern voice and I tell him I can't go around to the back. D hangs up with no response. So I walk up and knock on the door as usual. D answers the door with a look I can only describe as extremely pissed off and probably drunk. I play the whole customer service routine and give him the \"How are you doing tonight, sir?\" and \"I'll just need you to fill out this receipt.\" etc. Nothing I say gets a response out of him. He takes his pizzas, stiffs me, and I had back to the store. \n\nWhile en route to the store, D apparently called my store extremely angered that his pizzas were made wrong. That's great for me because I get to take the new ones back to him as the night had slowed down and we weren't sitting on any orders. Two new pizzas come out and I'm on my way again. Arrive at D's place and knock on the door. D comes lumbering out to the door, opens it and immediately barrages me with this rant. \"You're really pathetic, you know that? Can't even get the toppings right on a pizza. I wouldn't be surprised if this is where you end up for the rest of your life, doesn't look like you're going to aspire to much with how you work. It's really fitting though, a fat guy spending the rest of his life working at a pizza store, don't you think?\" After he finishes, I tell him \"When you pull that stick out of your ass, you can have your pizza.\" I turn around and head back to my car and try to drown out whatever shit he's spewing at me. I head back to the store and inform my shift manager what happened, leaving out the part where I basically told him to fuck off. Shift manager immediately blacklisted him. We get a call from D later demanding I be fired and I'm sure telling my shift manager an embellished story, but the shift manager in customer service mode politely told him he was not longer welcome to purchase from us and hung up. I finished my prep for the night and headed home. \n\nLow and behold the next day, I get a call. I answered with the normal 'Hello' I always give and I heard D say \"Thanks for calling me, now I know how to find you\". I immediately hung up and went to my parents to tell them what happened. They got the cops involved who paid a visit to D and I haven't heard from him since. \n\nFrom now on, whenever I have to call a customer, I call the store and have one of the guys answering the phones call the customer for me or use *67 before calling. I know the vast, vast majority of people wouldn't use your phone number for something like this, but its better to be safe than sorry. ",

        "text": "So everything was going as usual on a Saturday and there was a delivery to a semi\\-sketchy area, but nothing was thought otherwise about it. It was a large pizza with a cash order. My co\\-worker is up to take it, so she does. She has a bad habit of leaving her car running when it's out of sight and it came back to bite her last week. She left her car running and went up to the apartment. She knocks and calls, but there is no answer. She heads back down the stairs to notice that her car is gone. \n\nThis guy had pealed out of the parking lot in a 2005 Blazer. She calls the cops and gets put on hold by the dispatch operator. Apparently in his haste to get out of there he kept speeding through the main road that connects of these apartments. The police had already pulled him over and arrested him by the time she got done talking with the cops. After the fact we find out that not only had he used his name on the delivery order, but his own address as well. Half an hour didn't pass before she had her car back and was back at work. To top it all off we live in a city where LIVE PD \\(the tv show\\) broadcasts out of and it could have been shown. So this is just a friendly reminder to lock your car and don't keep it running if you can't see it. ",

        "text": "It's 10PM on a Friday night, the last carryout just picked up their order, and ticket 301 just popped up.  We are in the middle of a flash sale and I didn't have a closing cook or a driver due to a scheduling error.  After hooking up my phone to Bluetooth headset and starting the order I call my GM.\n\n\"Boss, you didn't schedule a cook after 10, and gave the closing driver a split shift without telling her, and now she's 60 miles away.\"\n\nHe stammered, and apologized and told me to start calling people as another order comes in.\n\n\"I don't have time for that.  In 6 minutes I'm going to cut these deliveries and take them myself.  Please, call around for me.\"\n\nThe next call was to the call center to set my time as high as it could go, and for the next four hours I made the pizzas, cut them, delivered them, then headed back to the store to make the next round.  In-between midnight and 1AM one of my shift leads showed up to \"help me close.\"  By that point I knew I was done.  Dough hadn't been touched, I had two full dish carts and about 7 barrels of dishes to do, not to mention breaking down make-table, sweeping, mopping, filtering the fryers, counts, doing the cash and paperwork, and running end of day.  Plus I still had orders that had to go out.  If I was lucky I would be out of there before the sun came up.  That had happened to me before, and after the 3rd time I swore it never would again.\n\n\"Boss,\" I said into my phone when the groggy voice answered.  \"I told you *never* to put me in this situation again.  I'm taking your last orders and walking out.  Keys are on the desk.\"\n\nAt 2:45AM I told the shift lead it was his choice if he stayed or not, but I was done, and never coming back.  In the three years in that store I was a driver, shift lead, senior shift lead, and Assistant General Manager.  I'd averaged 55 hours a week, done hundreds of thousands of pieces of dough, and even more dishes.  I'd put up with no call no shows on an almost daily basis, fights between drivers, customers screaming and spitting on me, and been put on my knees while an AR-15 was pointed at the back of my head and heard the words, \"If he can't open the safe just shoot him in the back of the head,\" while the time lock safe counted down from 10:00.\n\nAnd it was over.  The last thing I did was shoot a text to the district manager saying, \"Call Boss tomorrow and ask him why his ARGM and possibly his shift lead just quit.\"\n\n-\n\nI'd just been laid off from Sprint, where I worked their International Wireline Nocc on the swing shift.  Two months earlier my girlfriend of 3 years and I tied the knot, and now I was trying to figure out how to keep up my end of our finances.  I'd delivered pizzas in the past, and knew it was a good temp job until something permanent came along.  I'd applied at just about every pizza joint in the KC suburbs, but had avoided the city, so it came as a surprise when the GM of ghetto pizza called.  It's one of the few stores I hadn't applied, but I needed cash, and yesterday.  I started a few days later and started a whirlwind that consumed my life for the next three years.",

        "text": "Hello, long time lurker on here and first time poster. I’ve been a delivery driver at a pretty successful mom n pop shop for about 4 years and spent my current 5th year as a manager.\n\nTo give some background on this employee he is about 60 and used to work 77 hours a week. However he is also our slowest driver usually doubling delivery times. ( a delivery 5 mins away will take him 10 to get there and 10 back, then another 4 to get out of the car) because of this I was asked to cut his hours to 40. Which I did however he still ends every week with about 55 hours because of how god damn slow he is.\n\n If he knows it’s his last delivery because we are about to close he takes over an hour to come back no matter how far it is. Then when cashing out his receipts he “left one in the car” and literally needs to take 15 mins to look for it EVERY DAMN TIME. He also got us a 1 star review one day after making a customer get out of there apartment and grab the pizza from his car in the snow AND has his wife in the car with him at all times. He pretends to wash dishes and sneaks extra delivery’s going in other directions as he is walking out the door, making them late as he can barely handle one yet he leave with 3 for a 2.5 hour journey.\n\n Oh and I almost forgot, when he finishes his last delivery rather then parking at the CLOSED restaurant in all our parking spots he chooses to park at a gas station down the street and takes about 15-20 mins to walk over.\n\nSo what do you think? I kinda feel bad for the guy and want him to support his family but at the same time as a closing manager who works 12 hour shift I wanna fucking go home at the end of the day not wait for him to milk an extra 15 hours a weeks. Also how would I go about firing him? Any advice?\n\nSorry for format I’m on mobile and as I said because it’s my first post so I’m sure I’ll improve in the future. :)\n\nTLDR; Old man driver milks the clock for an extra 15 hours a week by being slow and is overall useless besides showing up on time everyday should I fire him? If so how do I go about it?",

I guess he sensed I what I was thinking, and he looks me right in the eye and tells me that a 1 gallon bag of change he’s holding must have about $20 in it, which would mean a good $5 tip for me. More apologies for paying in change, and a very sincere sounding, “Seriously bro, if there’s not at least a $5 tip in there, swing by tomorrow around this time....I’m getting cash tomorrow to be ready, just in case. If there’s more than $5 just keep it for the inconvenience.” I’m very skeptical in general, so I figured I’d end up with nothing, and seriously, like I’d go back a day later asking for a tip. Well, late that night I got home and imagine my surprise to find $38 in change (and a cool pair of dice!) in the bag. That meant a $23 tip for one pizza. Made my night.",

I love it because there's always a steady stream of deliveries during the day, and a good dinner rush, so I make bank on Sundays. Yesterday was no different. It was even a bit busier than normal so I had been taking doubles and triples all night.\n\nAround 8ish I got back to the store and started loading up a few deliveries and head out. I'm waiting at the light by my shop, in front of one of our competitor's drivers and another car, really into the version of the Grateful Dead's \"The Other One\" I'm listening to. The light turned green and I headed up the road to my first delivery.\n\nI'm pretty sure this place is a halfway house or something because the girls there wear ankle monitors and NEVER tip. Well I'm waiting for the oncoming traffic to pass so I can make a left turn onto the street the house is on, and all of a sudden I look in my side mirror and see a car absolutely *barreling* up this hill I'm stopped on, and think to myself \"fuck they're not stopping\"\n\nBefore I even have time to get my foot off the brake to get out of the way, I hear a loud bang and all of a sudden I'm stuck. My head is trapped in between my seat and the side of my car, and I don't know how badly I'm hurt. I could tell somewhere on my face was bleeding pretty badly, but I didn't want to try to get unstuck in case my neck or something was broken. After a few minutes or so, I decided to try to slowly slide my seat back which got me unstuck. I just remember touching my mouth and looking g at my hands and there being so much blood. I thought I was gonna bleed out right there. \n\nEventually cops and ems  came and I had my dad drive me to the hospital because fuck ambulance fees. And I still had all of my cash from the day so I had to stop back at the shop anyway. After 6 hours of waiting, they tell me I broke my nose in multiple places, but it's not draining and didn't crack more of my skull.\n\nI'm just glad I'm alive and have full control of all of my limbs. If she was a couple inches over to either side I could be dead right now. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE pay your full, undivided attention when you're driving guys. I went back to the scene on the way back from the ER and the lady that hit me didn't even try to stop. Not a single skid mark on the road. So she hit me at at least 45mph, almost definitely more with how fast people drive on that road. \n\nTl;dr: some lady rear ended my car at full speed and broke my nose. I thought I was going to die and now have a new appreciation for life.\n\nEDIT: I forgot to add that the other shops driver went around my car and the lady behind him is who hit me. ",

Normally we gather cash throughout the day, putting it in a lock box and at the end of the day, the card tips that we receive, subtract from the amount of money we owe back to the store for the cash orders we've taken. To my knowledge it is a perfectly fine and working system, and the only thing that can really go wrong is when the store is really low on cash and you got a lot of card tips, they may have to pay you the next day (has only happened to me once in 3 years.) \n\nWith the new money cards, we will still have to do the same process, but instead of card tips being given back to us in cash that we get to keep from orders, we now will receive it on a money card. Why??? I can't figure out what problem this is trying to solve and it seems completely unnecessary and I should be able to opt out. \n\nA couple of problems this causes. \n\n1) In order to use MY money to pay MY rent, I now have to drive to THEIR bank and take it out to put it into my account. \n\n2) The store will now have to make larger and more frequent deposits.\n\nNow deposits at my store are a responsibility that is annoying as hell because managers often get the drivers to do it and when there are more than three we have to make 2 trips or go to 2 separate branches to complete the transactions. \n\nAlready our store policy is against the grain because Deposits CANNOT be over $600 and this means splitting up the daily deposit into 3 or 4 small deposits. Stupid right?\n\nWell since drivers will no longer be relieving the store of this cash in the form of their payment, now we will easily have 2 or 3 more deposits EVERY DAY. \n\nThis policy shows how severely disconnected my corporate office is from the actual workings of a store and it pisses me off.

I tell them on the phone I can give them directions right now, just start driving back to where you entered campus from because I saw your car, but instead just tried looking for my building on previously stated unupdated map and says he just see’s construction zones, and then finally just takes my instructions. \n\nMy soup and sandwich was cold and my drink was melted. /: I just wanted comfort to get me through this project, and in addition wasted about a half hour waiting outside for the driver to show up. \n\nAnd if the driver is on here and recognizes the story I’m sorry dude but you drove right past my building that has a big sign on it with the name.

        "text": "So I work for a pizza restaurant off of a very wealthy college campus and unlike most, we’re open until 3am. I get an order for 4 larges and after getting the guys on the makeline to finish the pizza, I rush it to the dorm. 6 very drunk sorority girls walk out of the building and one slams a wad of cash in my hand, before walking back into the dorm and closing the door. Not a “hey” or a “hello”. Nothing at all. The order was about $38 if I remember correctly, so I check the money she gave me. I thought at first I was dreaming. Not one, not two, not three, but 4 $100 bills were sitting in my hand. I guess she thought they were tens. I called her back 3 times to try and tell her of her mistake, but she never answered. So I kept the money. \n\nLater my manager gets a call from a very angry customer saying how she had lost $400 and that I had robbed her. I showed him my call log and explained my side of the story. I was cleared. \n\nSo to all the people ordering pizza that may be on this subreddit, make sure you keep your phone on. Because if we call you, we have a damn good reason. We WILL keep your money",

        "text": "I have two medium stories from today I'm excited to share. The day is always eventful in one way or another.\n\nFirst delivery of the day. It was kind of slow due to having fabulous weather and a large event at a popular brewery in town. Started work at 4 and arrived at the first house at literally 4:20. PM. I chuckle to myself a little because immature. The lady lived in an upstairs house apartment, but didn't put that on the delivery note so after having the lady downstairs get all pissy with me because \"I woke her up\" knocking, I made my way behind the house up some sketchy ass stairs that I swear to God are about as strong as those Kinect toys from back in the day. Knock FIVE times before someone comes to the door. Lady is obviously blazed out of her mind. Signs the paper upside down, says \"THANKS!\" And goes back inside without taking the food. Had to knock again to give it to her, and it was at this point she knew that I knew and we both just laughed for a few seconds. I kept laughing all the way to the car.\n\nSecond was near the end of the night. Way less fun. Go to a house in little worse part of town but not that bad. Big ol Confederate flag In window and cardboard blocking the other windows taped up (just to paint the scene for you.) Huge lady answers the door and is polite and friendly. I hand her 5 large pizzas and some sodas, quite a full load in the pizza bag. Was in the process of taking the cash from her free hand as she grabs the pizzas and this fucking pit bull jumps out from between this woman's kankles and lunges at me. I immediately panic inside like a little girl but block my family jewels with the pizza bag as the family comes running out of the house yelling, \"DONT MOVE AND HE WON'T BITE YOU!\" obviously I'm thinking fuck this is how I die at some shithole to a dog who lifts more than me. The ladys son or boyfriend or brother or all three, idk, holds onto my shoulders for like a minute keeping me still while someone else chased down the dog who was running around me trying to bite my ass while I deflect it with the pizza bag like a mighty spartian warrior. At the end they tipped me 5 bucks and offered to let me take a hit of whatever they were smoking but I don't smoke the ganja so I declined. I also didn't want to go inside of the house because I honestly was terrified of the dog at that point and just wanted to go back to the store/home. Least I can buy some new boxers I guess.\n\nAnything interesting happen you guys? Always a strange day to deliver for me in one way or another. Last year I watched a guy break his glass bong on accident in front of me because he tried to sign the paper with it in his hand, but that's a story for another day.\n\nEdit: I know some people are calling BS but I tried to tell the story in a funny amusing way that you would enjoy. I assure these things happened but no I am not a spartian and I was probably shaking more than anything.🤷",

        "text": "   Everything was running smoothly all day, until I was unable to deliver food to an apartment which didn't exist in the complex (number  on ticket was 250, apartments only went from 200-224 but I tried 205 and 215 just in case.) So I returned to the store past 9 (closing for delivery), and told the manager that the address that I was given doesn't exist, and that I was unable to give the customer their pizza. I then personally call the customer, and ask what their address is. They give me an address that is only somewhat similar to the first address, this address also may or may not exist. I was then notified to take the now reheated pizza back to the customer with what I believed to be the correct address, in addition to another new delivery for a pizza and some wings. \n\nI had no way of knowing how old the second one was, due to the fact that is was not on any of the tickets I received. At the time, i had no second thoughts, and the manager specified that the reheat needed to be taken first. I grabbed the bags and left the store with two pizzas, one going back out to an address that was incorrect the first time. The first one was 4.7 miles away from the store. The second being a 5.4 Mile drive from the first one, 7.5 back to the store. \n\nI headed back to the reheat and attempted to locate the new address thoroughly, and was unable to do so. The GPS would only lead me to a building that certainly wasn't where I needed to go and I eventualy decided to cut the losses, since it was only a singular pizza and the address was incorrect twice. I began to head towards the second house, making what I believed to be good time with hot food.\n\n I pulled up to the second house, got out of the car and knocked on the door. An extremely overweight man answers the door, eating something. He's shaking his head. \n\n  \nThe customer is going to be referred to as FA and I'll be J.\n\n  FA: *shaking head* \"I don't know what to tell you man\"  \n\n  J: (I was standing there pretty confused)\n\nFA: \"it's been 2 hours, Idon't want cold food\" \n\nJ: \"the food isn't cold\" \n\nFA: \"I ordered 2 hours ago it should've been here a while ago\"\n\nJ: \"this food was just made before I left the store\n\nFA: \"what do you mean, I called the manager 40 minutes ago, he said it was on the way.\" \n\n&gt;Implying he doesn't live 8 miles away the store, which is a 15+ minute drive at least \n\n&gt;Also pretending that I didn't have to drive 10 total miles+a stop in a massive apartment complex which likely added another Mile or two. \n\n  J: \"I'm the only driver working and I had another delivery in the car\" (which the concept seems to baffle him) \n\n FA: \"I don't care, I don't want cold food\"\n\nJ: *opens the pizza box, revealing an incredibly hot pizza. Hot enough, that if bitten, would've burned his mouth.* \n\nFA: \"it's been 2 hours I don't really need it now\" (the whole time he's being condescending and derogatory to/about me for some reason)\n\nJ: \"I can take it back to the store if that's what you want me to do\" \n\nFA: \"yeah\"\n\n\n   J: \"alright\" (I begin walking away, and he begins closing the door) \n\n\n   FA: \"What *would* my total be if I wanted it\"\n\n   (I knew he wasn't going to pay for the food and     just wanted to add something else)\n\n    J: \"nah, I'm going back to the store\" \n\n    FA: \"????oH ArE yOu NOW????\" (Then proceeds to physically slam the door right in my face before I can even get out a response) \n\n\n\n\nI walked back to my car, food in hand, pretty dissapointed that my last two deliveries had both wound up being so unfortunate. I drive back to the store, pull up, get out and walk to the door with the hotbag in my hands. Before I can even say anything, the manager says \"both customers called, put the pizzas down, don't come back again\" \"you were rude to the customer. \n\nI explained what happened to him and he didn't say anything else. Then I was basically like \"don't give me any money I guess\" and he kinda shrugged, still not saying anything. Then I just walked out and left. \n\nI can only assume the customer called and had a fit on the phone.\n\n\nSo today I received a few tips and a total of $8 from the manager for 6 hours of work. This was supposed to be $48. I used $20 in gas taking 7-12 mile delivery runs. Seems as if it was work for nothing. \n\n\nEdit: I've been delivering for 6 months at a chicken place, just quit. There I never had a single issue like this, the GM/AMs kept cycling and the current one was a slave driver.  The day of this event I was filling in for a friend at a local Italian/pizza joint. It's an under the table job, paying $8/hr and they don't seem to care who does it any given day. \n\nHowever the wages were recovered, my friend got them for me. I think the manager was just having a bad day. \n\nThank you for all of the responses and advice! I really enjoy this community and may share some more tales from my experiences. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n",

        "text": "This happened somewhere around 2008 or 9. I worked for a reputable corporate chain pizza establishment in middle Tennessee. Murfreesboro to be exact. I had been there 5 years at this point and was a regular closer. Our store was on the outskirts of town and our delivery radius was 10 miles, so we delivered to some back-wood hills have eyes mofos at times.\n\nThis was a weekday; a slow night and we were starting to wind down and trying to get some pre-closing done. We would typically get a couple last minute orders late night which us drivers loved because if we were on the road the closing manager would start closing and that meant less work for us when we got back. \n\nWell an order rang in and it was my turn to deliver, and this customer happened to live on the very edge of our delivery area. I was happy because it would take a good 20-minute round trip, so that meant the other driver and my manager would damn near have all the closing done by the time I got back.\n\nI got the order and went on my merry way. I got to the customers house and everything seemed alright. It was a decent house, well lit, close neighbors. I didn't feel threatened at all. So, I approach the house, and everything seems normal. The front door is wide open, but I don't see anyone inside, so I knock on the glass storm door. Just beyond the living room was a bathroom that faced the front door. As soon as I knocked, almost as if this guy planned this shit, he exits the shower. He didn't even try to act surprised or startled, he’s just facing me twig and berries and all hanging out. \n\nThis startled the fuck out of me, so I stepped to the side of the door to get out of view of whatever the hell I was looking at.\nA few seconds pass and he comes to the door. He’s wearing nothing but boxers and he has half a chub hanging out the front of them. I quickly realize what is going on and to be honest, I had never been in this situation before and had no idea what the fuck to do. So I just go about my regular routine, “Hello sir, it’ll be 15.46” I was scared as shit. I hand him the pizza and he gives me a $20 and he tells me to keep the change. Cool, time to go I think…No\n\nThis dude grabs me by my pant front pocket and asks me if I want to come inside(I'm a dude btw). I’m petrified, seriously scared so bad I can’t even talk. I manage to say no I have to get back to the store, but that’s not good enough for him. He proceeds to take $1 bills and one by one slide them into my pocket, while trying to investigate my twig and berries and sweet talk me. I don’t know what to do, I have never been in a position like this before. I just stand there petrified as he is feeding dollar bills into my pocket and he’s growing visibly excited. Eventually after 7 dollars (and he took his sweet fucking time) he lets me go. I say nothing turn around and power walk back to my car.\n\nI get back to the store startled as fuck and tell my co-worker and manager what just happened. My manager is completely taken back by this and immediately goes to black list him from any further deliveries. My co-worker just says, “Yeah, he did the same thing to me.” I didn’t even know what to say, the same shit happened to him and he never even reported it. As shit as that situation was, I was ok and made an easy $10, and we never had to deliver to him again. I just can’t believe my co-worker was so nonchalant about it, and never mentioned anything to anyone about that guy.\n\nThe guy though reminded me of that creepy ass dude from Silence of the Lambs, I'm just glad I didn't get the hose.\n\ntl;dr: I delivered a pizza and was accosted while my pants were force fed dollar bills by a creep with his dick hanging out the front of his boxers while I stood there petrified.\n\n\n",

I arrive at her address and give her a call, as requested, and I let her know I’m outside she stumbles out of her apartment, again 149, and walks up to my car I give her the total and tells me to wait while she grabs the money. I look up and see her trying to go in to apt 150, I tell her it’s the wrong door and she shushes me and tells me I’m gonna wake up her neighbors. She somehow manages to open the door and a few moments later I hear screaming and yelling, the neighbors throw her out and threaten to call the cops and call me an idiot for not stopping her and slams the door. \n\nShe gives me the money and I give her the pizza, which she dropped like 5 seconds later, and I immediately call my boss to let her know what happened.",

I called the customer and informed them that I was close to their hotel (which I always name during the phone call, as a means of assuring that they are at that hotel and nowhere else), and asked that they head towards the lobby to pay for and receive their food, they obliged.\n\nI start small talk with the front desk clerk after she asks me if she needed me to call them, and a few minutes pass. After 5 minutes, I begin to worry because the customer stated they were in room 124, which could only be 100 feet from where I was standing, so I proceed to call them again. They don't answer the first couple of times, and I finally receive a call back from them.\n\n I begin the call by saying, \"I don't believe you are where you say you are.\" The young voice on the other end of the phone replies, \"Yeah, I told you the wrong hotel. I'm at......\" I inform him that the hotel he's staying in is across town and I could be there within 15 minutes, he accepts this information and states he'd still like me to deliver the pizza. I head over there and in my head, I'm just hoping that he intends to compensate me for the mistake that he's made and the consequent time that I've wasted now.\n\nI arrive at the correct hotel, go to the room and tell him his total is $18.62. He proceeds to pull out a 20 and tells me to keep the change. I grimace, thank him, and walk away. Somehow I knew this would happen. I basically made enough to cover the gas it took me to drive around trying to find him. ",

        "text": "I just remember a story about the busiest day every year.  We opened up a new store and it was the first new delivery unit in the region in about 15-20 years.  The first few weeks we were super slow because no one really knew that we were open.  But after that we were the busiest (gross sales) delivery/carryout unit in the city.\n\nA couple of weeks prior to Superbowl Sunday, we started getting calls about doing advanced ordering for the Superbowl.  We told them that we are not doing advanced orders for Superbowl.  They got upset, but we didn't take orders.\n\nEvery morning, we'd get advanced order tickets printing out for Superbowl.  I suppose people were trying to be clever and ordering online with delayed delivery.  There were about 30 advanced orders that had the exact same delivery time on Superbowl Sunday and then about 20 more around that same delivery time.  I asked my area manager the Friday before Superbowl how were we going to handle the logistics of that.  \"We're not supposed to be taking advanced orders for Superbowl.\"  I said, \"They are doing them online.\"  He told me with a straight face, \"Cancel them.\"  I did.  Then I asked, \"Will the system notify the customers that we cancelled their orders?\"  My area manager shrugged.\n\nI can tell you now the system did NOT notify the customers.  All hell broke loose.  Being the busiest day of the year, I already had my hands full running the store and talking with customers about late orders.  I got plenty of \"where's my order\" calls, but the first one that didn't show up in the system set off an alarm in my head.  I was about to get a bunch more of these calls for the next few hours.  I told all my CSRs to give the phone to me if a late order wasn't in the system.  I got yelled at continuously between the hours of 5-9pm.  I explained what had happened, but we were in the wrong.  Guys were threatening to beat up me.  People were cussing me out.  One guy even demanded that we pay him for wasting his time.  It was a rough night.  I quit on the second busiest day of the year.\n\nTLDR;  I cancelled all advance Superbowl orders made online.  All hell breaks loose with dozens of customers expecting food that will never come.",

        "text": "Maybe also r/MaliciousCompliance. I'll try to keep this short. (Edit: I Failed) I have a driver who is basically, suddenly, a man-child. When I was his age, I had already served three years in the military. But at 20, he (suddenly) doesn't know how to use his words or handle his emotions. \n\n\nAbout a month ago, he was one of my favorite employees. But something changed and all of a sudden he doesn't want to do dishes, he doesn't want to fold boxes, he doesn't want to close, he doesn't want to do anything except Drive. And even then, he's sometimes reluctant and will often give his deliveries to other drivers so he can just stay on Cut table and cut pizzas until he's literally the only driver in the store and I have to tell him, \"You're the only one here. Go take this order.\"\n\n\nI noticed this change in behavior and asked him about it. I literally got the silent treatment. Like I was standing in front of a fucking toddler, his arms crossed, just staring...\n\n\nWhen assigning duties, telling this person to go make sauce cups, this person to pre stretched some dough for dinner rush, telling that person to fold some boxes, and telling Him to do... anything... He would literally do anything except what I told him to do. Walk outside and smoke a cigarette, go over to make line even though there's no orders up, go stand by the dish pit even though there's no dishes, etc.\n\n\nFinally, one night while closing with him, I asked him to go take care of the dishes at 10:50 p.m. We close at 11. I was literally going to do everything else. Clean the make line, cut table, and stretch table. Run the deposit, sweep and mop, and take out the trash, etc. All he had to do was maybe 30 minutes of dishes, then I would have sent him home so I could stay behind and fold a LOT of boxes (because we only had like 5 XL boxes folded for the next morning shift and that was all.)\n\n\nDid he do that? No. Of course not.\n\n\nInstead, he very slowly and while being on his phone the entire time, slowly swept, mopped, took the trash out, and literally did anything else that he could possibly think of except those dishes. \n\n\nThe one thing I asked him to do, he refused to do it, all the while giving me the silent treatment like he was a goddamn child. \n\n\nOh, and the money that he owed to run his check out, for his cash deliveries that night, he just kind of Threw It On The Floor...\n\n\nFinally, around 12:20 a.m., he can't find anything else to (half assedly) do so he wanders out to the lobby and sits down, pulls out his phone. Meanwhile, I long ago finished all of my work and have also folded over 300 boxes like I intended to do after sending him home but since he wanted to dick around, I got to work and knocked all of that out.\n\n\nHe still hasn't touched a single dish.\n\n\nHe could have left an hour ago but for some reason, he wanted to play the victim, feel put upon, and instead (very slowly) do literally anything else that he  could think of except for the one thing I asked him to do.\n\n\nOnce he sat down in the lobby, I told him, (almost verbatim) \"I don't know what your problem has been lately. I don't know why you're being so uncooperative and pissing off literally every other driver lately, but I asked you to do just one thing tonight. And you still haven't done it. You could have been out of here an hour ago but here we are, because you think you're, what? Making some kind of stand? Proving some kind of point? You're giving me the silent treatment like a toddler. Like a child. It's a serious question because I literally don't know why you're acting this way because you won't open your mouth and use your adult words... But I'll tell you this. If you think you're leaving here without doing that one thing I asked you to do over an hour ago, then you are either insane or you Want a write up.\"\n\n\nSitting there in the lobby, well past when I would have normally left for the night,  he opened his mouth for first time All Shift and said, \"I don't care. Give me the stupid write up.\" \n\n\nI said \"Fine. Go ahead and go home.\" And he left.\n\n\nAfter he pulled out of the parking lot with his tires screeching (and I still don't know why because he won't talk to anyone...) I washed all of those dishes by myself and then I filled out his first write up. \n\n\n10 days later, he earned a second one for the exact same behavior, disrespect, and unwillingness to work with others, and unwillingness to just do his job, and nobody at the store has any idea why he's acting this way because he's wants to act like a man child/victim who won't use his words and (apparently) simply wants to dig his own grave.\n\n\nIf he tries to pull this bullshit on one more shift, he will be fired.\n\n\n*Look, I get it. Sometimes life gets hard, sometimes circumstances change, but if you're going to be an adult in the workforce, no matter what your job is, if something happens, you need to communicate.*\n\n\nIf you ever flat out refused to do your job,  that I am literally paying you for, then do not be surprised when you get in trouble for it. This **is** a free country and you **are** free to make your own choices but you are **Not** free or exempt from the *consequences* of those choices. And so...\n\n\nTLDR: If you refuse to do your job and then ask me for a write up? I will give you a write up...",

        "text": "Twice now in the past week I've been accused of stealing the customer's money because I can't instantly refund their money when there is a void.\n\nFirst off, let me state that when a void situation comes around, it's more often than not the customer's fault.  In one situation this week they didn't answer the door or phone and didn't call back until the next day, in the other situation they didn't have an apartment number, didn't answer the phone, a voice mail or a text until about 2 hours after their order.\n\nOur policy is to void orders that were undelivered for any reason at the end of the night.  If you don't get your food, even it it's your fault, you don't pay.\n\nNow here's where things get tricky.  When you pay via a card (credit or debit) we obtain an authorization for the amount of the order.  This places a hold on the money.  We don't actually get the money that instant.  At the end of the night, we finalize all the credit card transactions, add in the tips, etc.  Any orders that were voided just drops out of the system, a transaction never actually goes through to the bank\n\nNow your bank sees that we have placed a hold on your money.  However they don't see a transaction at the end of the night.  However, many businesses don't process every night, so sometimes it takes a couple of days for a transaction to process.  So the bank doesn't immediately release the hold on you money.  We have absolutely no control over how long the bank waits until they release the hold.  2-5 days is typical.\n\nSo that's why it appears that money is immediately withdrawn from your account, because the hold is instant, the bank wants to make sure you don't spend more than you have.  The bank also doesn't want to get burned by a transaction that takes a couple of days to process, so it keeps a hold for a reasonable period of time.  We don't have your money.",

        "text": "Not a verbose story, but one that really spoke to me.\n\nSo I've been kind of very relaxed on the delivery game lately. Essentially I'm only opening and opening has been VERY slow for the past few months.\n\nSo it's Sunday morning, there's some food thing in town so it's super fucking slow. We get an order to some student housing complex. It's a pretty shitty complex, which is weird since it's an upperclassmen housing place. This place has no way to access the inside of it, so we have to call beforehand and have them meet us at the leasing office. Fair enough.\n\nWhat this means though is that there's the risk of them not picking up and us just being there for a while.\n\nHowever, me as a driver for over a year, I've learned to not wait for anything.\n\nAs I've mentioned in previous stories, I'm from California, but driving in Texas, but I still have a California number (before people ask, I did look into getting a second phone, but even getting a flip phone and adding it to verizon is... not particuarly super expensive but way more than I want to spend on customers who are too scared to answer their phones).\n\nSo I call about 4 times. The dude hangs up each time after about the 3rd or 4th ring. I drive by the leasing office to see if maybe he's waiting there, and he isn't. So I drive back, make the order undeliverable, usual stuff, and I go on my next run. Usually with this kinda stuff, it's pretty basic \"oh hey where's my pizza\", yadda yadda yadda, I probably have to take it when I get back.\n\nI'm in the middle of a double when I get a text message. This is about 20 minutes after my last call.\n\n\"Sorry man I was in the bathroom im on my way down now\"\n\nMust have been a monster shit i guess.\n\n$1.05 tip.\n\nCollege towns are living hells.",

        "text": "Well I finally got one to share after lurking here for years. Mind you, this could have been avoided if I would have been more careful and not as gullible.\n\nSo, I deliver to a new customer. Been to his front neighbor many times, so it seemed familiar. I knock, I see the guy wearing a bud light dilly dilly shirt. Cool, it's Sunday, probably relaxing.\n\nHe's on the phone as he opens the door says \"Hold on Pizza's here.\" And I tell him the total and ask for the money, to which he replies \"Oh it's been paid for, did it over the phone.\" \n\nI say \"Really? Oh, perhaps you made it as I was coming to deliver it. Alright, here you go, if you like, sign here and if you were going to tip, add it under the signature.\"\n\nNo tip. Whatever, happens all the time. \n\nSo a few hours go by and it was busy, but i began thinking, did this guy pay? I go and check, and turns out, no he didn't. I get upset and anxious, tell my manager and says why didn't I call to make sure? He was right, I should have and a lapse of judgment on my end. \n\nIts fine, I'll call and pick up the money. Well, he didn't answer, twice. Fine, ok, let me go and knock. Knock and ring the door bell, nothing. Knock harder and he opens the door. This is where it got, fun. \n\nRemember the bud light shirt, well now i could smell it from the few feet he was standing from me. \n\nMe: \"Hi sir, so I was checking the order for payment turns out there was no payment made\"\n\nCustomer: \"Really? No I made it.\"\n\nM: \"No, I'm sorry but perhaps it didn't go through. If you like you can just pay me right now. Its $$$\"\n\nC: \"What? Fuck no, I'm not paying you.\"\n\nM: \"Wait what? Why?\"\n\nC: \"I don't have cash on me, look, I'll just go to the fucking store later ok!?\"\n\nM: \"Sir, that's fine if you don't have cash why don't you just call and make the payment over the phone with your debit card right now\"\n\nThis is where he proceeded to, what I'm thinking was some sort of intimidation tactic from him, and sizes me up, well, tried too at least. See he wasn't as tall as me but got face to face. I could smell that cheap POS trash they call bud light, yikes.\n\nM: \"Sir, What are you doing? Are you trying to intimidate me?\"\n\nC: \"I already said I'm not fucking paying you alright. So get the fuck outta here.\"\n\nSLAMS the door.\n\nTo which I yell loudly over his locked door.\n\nM: \"YO YOU KNOW THIS IS THIEFT RIGHT? FINE MAN. I'MA JUST CALL THE POLICE.\"\n\nI call my manager tell him what happened and he says don't worry about it, send him a text saying if you're not going to pay my manager will call the police and handle it from there. Honestly, I don't even know if they can do something, but what a hassle and waste of a Sunday for all parties involved. \n\nI guess he, or his wife that I could see as he slammed the door looking very annoyed of the situation, talked some sense into him. Because sill on the phone with my manger, he tells me that he's calling to make the payment.\n\nI get back to the store and he tells me he paid, but wanted this to be know, \"I'm not tipping that guy!\" \n\nYeah, I know you cheap fuck, if you would have you would have tipped earlier when you signed.\n\nI have been working for almost 3 years at this Pizza Hut, and it's in the nicer more steady middle class part of town, never had anything or anyone try to size me up or do anything.

        "text": "Warning: offensive language. \n\nI was delivering to an area with many backroads (technically out of our delivery area by quite a bit, but the pizza was made, so oh well). At first I drove to the wrong town because whoever took the order had typed the program’s default zip code which is the same as our store, and there was a house with the same number on the same street number in the adjacent town.\n\nI called the customer and realized what had happened, and drove off to the right house. The last few minutes of the drive were in an area where nothing is marked and all the roads are gravel and dirt. It was pouring rain and very muddy today. As I was halfway down the gravel road and almost at the house I see a handwritten sign which reads “DRIV SLOW !!! (sic)”.\n\nI was going 15-18 mph on this road, which has no speed limit sign, and realized I was kicking up a decent amount of gravel, so I slowed down to about 10. I look to my left and see an older man flipping me off out in the rain and screaming. He was in front of what looked like a dilapidated old shack beside a pretty large house. I continued on and pulled up to the customer’s house about three blocks away. \n\nWhen I got out of my car, I heard, “You! Fucking piece of shit! Slow your goddamn ass down!” He was screaming at me from the far end of the road.\n\nI was very polite because he seemed a little off. “My apologies —”\n\n“Apologies my ass, you faggot! We got animals running around in the street, and kids too! You trying to run over our animals, you fuckin’ piece of shit?”\n\nI refrained from telling him that there were no animals or children anywhere – nobody but him – and from asking him why he was more concerned about fictional animals being run over than about kids being killed. \n\n“I’m very sorry. Won’t happen again.”\n\n“Shut the fuck up! I’ll fucking shut you up, fag!”\n\nHe turned around and walked back into wherever he came from and I went to the customer’s door. I assumed it was over. I talked to the customer for a minute, then came back to my car. When I sat down in the driver’s seat, I hear a thump on the right side of the car and the dude is staring through my window. He had run three blocks up to my car and waited for me.\n\nI rolled down my window a tiny crack and he said, “I’m fuckin sick of you little faggots cruisin’ down my road like some big shots you cocksucker.” Then he points at me and says, “if i ever see you here again, or any of your little ass-buddies, I’m gonna fuck you up so hard. I’m gonna have your balls to my wall, bitch! You trying to kill our fucking animals?”\n\nAgain I apologized, but as I was talking the guy tries to reach his hand through the window to hit me and starts kicking the door, screaming that he’s going to kill me.\n\nI drove off, and when I got back to the store he was on the phone with my manager telling him I threatened him and spit at him. Almost lost my job.\n\nHere’s a tip for those of you who have never held a service job: if you find yourself angry – whether reasonably or not – at the person across the register, or on the other end of the phone, or on your doorstep holding food that they just drove to you so you didn’t have to leave the house, just remember that that’s an actual human person with feelings and emotions who may be going through some shit in their own lives. Whatever it is probably isn’t their fault in the first place, and even if they are responsible, you have to ask yourself whether whatever mistake they made was so egregiously evil that you need to threaten their life.",
