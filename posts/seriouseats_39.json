I didn't get much further since my arm was getting tired and I folded the beaten egg whites instead of continuing.  \n\nAt that point, I thought that since whipped cream relied on the milk fats to form the micro-bubble structure that made whipped cream, that mascarpone was even fattier than whipping cream, and that egg yolks were just basically fat and wate, there was a chance that the mix could be whipped as well.  \n\nAnd if it could be whipped, discarding the beaten egg whites would result in a more mascarpone-y tiramisu without loosing too much lightness.  \n\nSo my questions are:  \n\nCan a mascarpone+egg yolk mixture be whipped like whipped cream?  \n\nAnd is there a means to make a whipped cream from mascarpone that is mostly mascarpone*?  \n\n*I've seen whipped cream recipes that involved mostly whipping cream and a bit of mascarpone but I want to know of the opposite is possible.",

        "text": "I decided to experiment a bit by boiling the potatoes in a solution using sodium hydroxide instead of the sodium bicarbonate in the recipe. \n\nI used 4.0g NaOH in 2L of water to boil the potatoes. All other steps were the same. \n\nFor those interested, this raises the pH of the water to around 12.7 by my calculations, up from around 8.6 using sodium bicarbonate. This is around 1000 times more basic, assuming my calculations for the sodium bicarbonate are correct - I had to pull dissociation constants from my old chemistry books and hopefully did the calculation correctly. NaOH dissociates completely so for a 0.05M solution, pH is 12.7, whereas for the original recipe, it's a 0.0238M solution of a weaker base, hence the large difference. \n\n*End chemistry class portion of post* \n\nThe album shows the results after boiling, where the edges were already becoming yellow/brown, then after tossing, then after 20, 40, 50 minutes. \n\nThe finished product was amazing, tons of crunch and flavor. Crust was about 1.5-2mm thick and insides were super fluffy and tender. I used russet potatoes. \n\nOven was 400F using convection, actual temperature around 410 according to the thermometer. Total time was 50 minutes. \n\nhttp://m.imgur.com/a/98JCz",

Typically, it's sliced roast pork shoulder as opposed to pulled. Herein lies my problem-\n\nAfter roasting to 165F, I've noticed the majority of the fat is only partially rendered. Now, I'm not sure why this is surprising to me given the fact I smoke a fair amount and know you've got to be north of 190F. Ultimately I guess my question is - at what temp am I going to get a product with the majority of the fat rendered and connective tissue broken down while still being able to thinly slice? How do I make a good product that's not just oven roasted pulled pork?\n\nLooking forward to responses! Happy to provide any additional info on the product, process, etc. ",

I've made it small batches before, but this one will be several pork butts, in the 25-30 lb range total. \nThe recipe is awesome as it stands, but I'm wondering if it would benefit from brine soak prior to marinating? It's not necessarily dry when it's done..but to get the crispy exterior, it seems like there's a little flavor/moisture loss that I think a brine would help with. Any thoughts?",

        "text": "Hi\n\nWith the Lunar New Year being just under a month away, I've been looking at various ways to utilize my sous vide machine. I'll be making Kenji's awesome Pork Belly Buns, while also using it to cook the scallops for my [Pen Cai](http://thediningtable.sg/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Jade-Eight-Treasures-Fortune-Pen-Cai.jpg) and the chicken breast for my [Samsui Chicken](http://themeatmen.sg/samsui-chicken/).\n\nAs you can tell, I absolutely love to cook sous vide, which leads me to my question - could an entire fish be cooked that way? The [recipe](http://thewoksoflife.com/2015/05/steamed-whole-fish/) calls for steaming it, but I've never cooked it before and I'm worried about overcooking it. I'll most likely be using a Red Grouper as my fish, and I intend to follow Kenji's guide for Halibut and cook it for 1 hour at 130 F. Does anyone think that this will work?\n\nThanks, and any advice will be much appreciated!",

        "text": "So I posted the other day about my 4x Bolognese sauce that I used to make 4 massive lasagnas. Something just wasn't right and while it tastes alright there was no wow factor and I found myself dreading having to eat it over and over since all my guests 12 adults and 4 kids didn't manage to complete even one.\n\nI tried drowning it in ketchup but it only masked the overwhelming meatiness. \n\nFinally I came to realize that what we didn't really enjoy was that it was basically ALL meat with a few noodles. \n\nSo I cut it into six pieces and took them out one at a time. Then cut the pieces into 2 and created essentially 2 lasagnas. Then poured on a jar of tomato and basil sauce, covered with Italian 4 cheese mixture and baked it. Finished off with a broil.\n\nI had guests over again and this time the lasagne got  licked clean! \n\nNow I don't dread the 2 remaining ones in the freezer....As it turns out I actually have 4.\n\nGuess I just don't like traditional all meat Bolognese lasagne. I want the sauced up melted cheese with underlying umami goodness from what turns out to be a fantastic meat sauce when it is not the only game in town.\n\nApologies to any purists that are cringing at this bastardization. I say I am sorry but in reality I don't care ! \n",
