        "text": "When I say pedestrian-only walkable, I'm talking something similar to [Tanger Outlets in Deer Park](https://imgur.com/7p666dX), streets designed for walking, no cars. A few key aspects to add:\n\n* Buildings in the core of the downtown would be mixed-use and have an avg height of 5-10 stories.\n* Building heights would gradually get shorter as you got further from the core, so as to not have an abrupt transition from residential homes to dense downtown.\n* The perimeter of the downtown zone would have parking garages for people shopping/working/living in this downtown, and LIRR riders.\n* The center of the downtown would be a town square with space for events.\n\nI may be wrong, but this seems to me like the best way to increase housing supply with minimal increase in traffic, as the residents of these downtowns could also work/dine/shop there without needing a car. It would also allow residents of one downtown to take the train to another downtown without driving.\n\nThis concept could bring a sense of community to each town that sporadic strip malls do a horrible job of. It would allow suburbs to be a more desirable location for business to locate their offices, decreasing the number of people that need to make long commutes to either the city or large office parks.\n\nImagine being a young professional who lives in one of these downtowns. You'd be able to walk or bike to your job in the commerce district, stop by the grocery store or gym on your walk home, and then grab dinner with your friends in the dining district, all without leaving the downtown or needing a car. There are some developers working on similar projects, but nothing involving a complete rezoning to pedestrian-only as far as I know.\n\nLong Island  in particular is one of the very few suburban regions in the country with the commuter rail network to allow this to work without causing bad traffic problems.

What cities should we have a look at?\n\nAfter a long battle with Python and Anaconda, some modifications and major frustrations - I finally also got [Geoff Boeings script](https://github.com/gboeing/osmnx-examples/blob/master/notebooks/17-street-network-orientations.ipynb) to work. His code can be hard to understand by an amateur like me. But I can now generate street orientation graphs.\n\nGive me interesting requests! Since it's already late here, requests will be fulfilled not before 12 hours from now.\n\nI intend to show the biggest and most interesting German cities. My other system has been trying to generate a graph for the whole Ruhr area for a couple of hours now.\n\nI leave you with [Sylt](https://imgur.com/a/bcIpNfP), an island in the north sea. You can really tell the [long but narrow shape](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=10/54.8813/8.3263) from it's graph.\n\nAlso: Someone [commented here](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/8yrevu/oc_street_orientation_of_dutch_cities/e2d8l6u) on why these diagrams aren't perfectly symetrical. I'm pretty sure this has to do how the street lines are saved in the openstreetmap database on which these graphs are based. The order of the points that make up a street give it one specific direction, even though a street has of course two directions in real life. But it would be easily possible to rectify this in the script, if one prefers it that way.",

I can live somewhere cheaper and commute to a city center!\". This isn't exactly the same motive as suburbs, where people fled a city and wanted a pastoral caricature.. but it may result in the same thing. For example let's take a super economic hub like silicon valley. It's impossible for anyone to live here and only getting worst. I certainly don't see anyone benefiting from appreciation signing on to double the housing stock. But a theoretical alternative could be someone living in Nevada and commuting at 700mph to San Francisco.\n\nThoughts?",

(bus, tram, trolley, metro/underground trains, etc.)\n\nIt seems to me, that the **bus** could be (in almost any situation) **highly superior** to any other public transport vehicle, **am I overlooking something**?\n\n**Why? Because buses:**\n\n1. Don't need infrastructure (besides road)\n2. Are highly flexible: can be easily diverted when city needs change (both short and long term)\n3. Are highly scaleable\n4. Allow for shorter wait times: 5 buses coming every 12 minutes &gt; 1 tram coming every hour (both could transfer the same number of people)\n5. Easily accessible when it comes to stops\n\n**Some downsides of buses:**\n\n1. They need more drivers (a real problem in case of labor shortage)\n2. Pollute more (if not electric)\n3. Energy costs and maintenance may be (slightly more?) costly (?)\n4. (Compared to metro/underground trains: slightly increases road congestion)\n\nSo why don't we only use buses? I've googled for good comparisons but it wasn't detailed enough.",

        "text": "Title really says it all. I'm one semester out of graduating with my bachelors, and after forcing myself through engineering school and a couple of internships, I've come to realize that it's not for me. I'm not looking for anyone to tell me that I should just stick with my upcoming computer engineering career. I've heard it from enough people and it would be a waste to go through the effort to tell me. \n\nAssuming I end up really committed to making this career change, does anyone have any advice as to how I could leverage my degree and start getting relevant experience for a planning career? I am familiar with several languages and my background in programming could make learning GIS easier. Anyone else have any experience moving from a STEM field into planning? \n\nI'm relatively close to UNC-Chapel Hill and they apparently have a very nice graduate program in planning. I could work within the computer engineering industry for a year or two while getting a masters? I just don't know how necessary that is given that my degree is supposedly very marketable.\n\nThanks for reading! :)",

        "text": "In the near future, cars will be able to drive themselves legally and will be available for the average consumer. Naturally that means that the automatic driving software will be used in campers as well, which makes the case for a pretty comfortable life on the road. You could basically tell your car to drive from New York to San Francisco in three weeks time, stopping in several cities on the way and even have it automatically park for lunch at an appropriate restaurant according to your schedule, every day. Meanwhile, you yourself have been working on your laptop this whole time it's been driving on the road, allowing you to enjoy the each stop as you wish and still make a living doing so.  \n\nWould this lifestyle appeal to a lot of people? How would this impact our cities? There is currently a war on parking lots going on; meanwhile if this indeed is a \"revolution\" in the way we live and experience our cities, would parking lots not be a blessing? Instead of hosting empty cars, they'd host visitors who live on them instead. \n\nI'd argue that mobile homes, if legislated and handled properly, would be a great way to counter act the soaring rents in the post-airbnb world. Lower taxes on renting mobile homes and long term rentals (longer than one week). Increase taxes on rents less than one week in length, in permanent buildings. This makes for a vibrant tourist scene as well as making housing available for permanent citizens at affordable costs. ",

I'm definitely in the landscape-y bit of this, but through this experience I've gotten touch with the preservation organizations in this city. These organizations either advocate for or actually regulate historic zoning on neighborhoods, historic characters of houses, no demolitions, OK to thoughtful &amp; respectful renovation of houses, but NO to mindless gentrification... You get the idea.\n\nWhat do you guys think about that kind of stuff? I'm really open to any opinions, experiences, literature that are for/against this field of work. Frankly, I've really gone through my life without learning about this field (aside from the general \"gentrification\") ... I'd really like to know how this discipline/practice is viewed or handled in the urban planning communities. \n\nThanks in advance! ",
