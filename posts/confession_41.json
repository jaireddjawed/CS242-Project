        "text": "I always see people complaining about rent and saying they are living paycheck to paycheck, but all you have to do is take advantage of the time you're living with your parents or are at college. Here's what I did, I'm a 19 year old male.\n\nSummer 2019 after sophomore year, got my first job. Part time,minimum wage job. But, I Made 3k that summer.\n\nHowever that 3k went to my car. For a 12k car, I paid 3k of it and my parents paid 9k of it. Even though I had some savings, let's just say I'm back to 0$.\n\nDuring junior year, I worked only Sundays. I made another 3k by the summer of 2020. I'm at 3k.\n\nDuring the summer of 2020, I had to get a different job bc of covid, but I upped my hours and made 4k. I'm at 7k.\n\nDuring the school year of 2020 to 2021, my senior year, I worked 2 days a week, made 6k. I'm at 13k.\n\nDuring the summer of 2021, I made 4k again. I'm at 17k.\n\nI start college. Work with my friend at Papa Murphys. Minimum wage goes up where my college is. I work 2 days a week. Got  7,000. I'm at 24,000.\n\nDuring the summer of 2022, I committ to working full time and make 10,000. I'm at 34,000 now.\n\nDuring the school year of 2022-2023, I lowered my hours to 1 day a week. I should have made 5000, putting me at 39,000.\n\nThis summer, I will work full time but up my hours and try to make around 12k. Should be 51,000.\n\nIf I continue this for my junior and senior year, I should have made another 34,000 which takes me at 85,000.\n\nI will live with my parents one more year after college. Assuming I have a decent job that pays me 50,000 a year, I will have 130,000 by the time I move out, age 23, and will have 0 struggles at all with affording rent. I can even save money even more by renting a shared space, with roommates.\n\nYou can get rich without being spoiled. My parents are rich but they just didn't hand it to me. I see why now. With the amount of money I've earned and will be earning, perhaps if they just handed money to me ( like my friend who's parents give hin 1000 dollars for literally no reason at all ), I wouldn't have been motivated as I am now.",

        "text": "I 17m am a junior in high school. My life isn’t great. My mom doesn’t make enough money to support herself and her 3 kids. My father is an illegal immigrant who was deported to Mexico on drug charges. He only sends us money when my mom is at a panic mode or when it’s our birthdays. I have been working a job since my the beginning of my sophomore year. I’ve been planning on saving most of my money. At least 95% of it so I have some money to travel after high school. Recently though, things went for the worst. My mom’s van broke down and wouldn’t start anymore. She doesn’t have much money. To make things even worse we no longer qualify for food stamps. Meaning my mom has to stretch money even further. Money she doesn’t have. As a result, my older brother and I have had to help her. My older brother is out of high school and makes a lot more money than me while I have to work part time so I can maintain my grades. The amount of money she needs from me is more than half my paycheck. It kills me to see that much money going away. I understand I should do my part to get out of a bad situation but I don’t feel anyone my sage should be forced into such a position.Even worse. Our home life isn’t great. Constant yelling and screaming. Lack of respect from my older brother towards me and my little brother. All the family trauma. I’m sick of it all. I want to get away from this place. \n\nI’ve always wanted to join the military. Ever since I was a little kid. My mom is the kind of person what can’t let her kids go. She must always be near them. Growing up she said she’d never let me go. But a recruiter from the army talked to my mom and me and she managed to convince her that me joining might not be a bad thing. I did ultimately decide to join the marine corps, though. But I am greatful to that army recruiter. This April is when the Marine recruiter told me I could begin my enlistment process. I am very happy because it’s all coming together for me. I will do something I’ve wanted to do since I was a little kid and finally I will get to get away from my family by joining the marine corps. I’ve worked so hard just to be eligible. I’ve lost nearly 60 pounds and I work out 5 times a week to make boot camp easier for me.\n\nPart of me feels guilty for wanting to leave my mom this way. Of course I won’t tell her. The only people who know are my best friend and whoever reads this post. Again, I feel really guilty but I do need to focus on myself.",

Recently I have been experimenting and I realized that I am attracted to both males and females. I will admit I have been sleeping around. Recently I noticed I have a thing for bigger breasts. \n\nMy sister and I have had a bit of a strained relationship recently we were arguing and it was getting out of hand so my parents organized a get-together with the whole family where we were to drink and get everything off our chests. Everything was going great until my sister got drunk and accidentally came out to our parents, it was a shock to our parents but since they parents seemed supportive I also took the chance to come out. \n\nAfter a while, I and my sister were left alone to make sure the air was cleared between us. as we sat across from each other I caught myself staring at her breast, she noticed and asked if I was attracted to her. I had never thought about her that way before but at that moment I said yes. I realize how fucked up it is but we started making out. We left the bar and went to a motel and slept together when I woke up I was horrified at what I had done and left. I haven't seen or spoken to my sister since. \n\nI am disgusted with my actions and unsure of how to go about this.",

I've never been stopped but if I ever do I'll just say oops forgot to scan it. \n\nAnother great tip is, just stealing in general, as your walking out, strike up a conversation with the door / security. Ask them a question / directions, anything to divert them away from the fact your literally holding stolen merch in your hands.",

        "text": "I’m going to try very hard to not graphically describe anything to remain within the rules of this subreddit.\n\nIt started when I was 10 and he was 6. I know this, remember it even, as murky as those times were, because that’s when our mother died. I remember things, some more clearly than others, even before then. Like drinking milk from a bottle. It was always warm, and sometimes chocolate-flavored. I recall something about vitamin-enhanced, but not exactly of what kind. I also remember a red sippy cup. I remember being weaned onto that with that same chocolate-flavored milk and orange juice, and it being as much my choice, to be a ‘big kid’, as it was my parents, I guess. I just have no memory of being breastfed. It didn’t really occur to me, either, at 10 years old, that being breastfed was something I couldn’t recall. Not at that time. Not until I was an adult.\n\nIt was late at night, near bedtime. It had to have been, because I recall wearing bluish-colored pajamas as I brushed my teeth. I was sad then. It couldn’t have been more than a couple weeks since mom had died. I remember the light above the sink felt too bright. In walked my brother. I remember glancing his way. I remember he looked sad too. And then he just, I guess, asked for some milk. This, I recall, seemed like something strange to be asked. Not because a warm glass of milk before bed was anything bizarre, but because he’d asked me, of all people. I guess I kind of just shrugged the feeling off and said he could have some. Well, next thing I know, he’s at my side, pulling at my top. I remember being very confused and very angry at him for this. And I remember him being brought to tears, but I don’t recall what I’d said. I remember being scared, not by his crying, but because I might end up in trouble for making him cry, especially since dad was feeling so sad himself.\n\nI don’t really know how my brain worked back then, but I know I gave in to his tantrum. I hadn’t been aware, at that point, that milk came from mammalian breasts or that it was a ‘female’ only sort of thing. I kind of just said ‘fine’ and helped him pull my top off. It was weird and it was confusing seeing him latch onto what amounted to ‘nothing’ and to the same spots he and dad both had. Maybe it even occurred to me why he wasn’t asking dad to give him milk. I didn’t think much of it then, really. My brother apparently knew more than me, at any rate, as he least knew where milk came from and what gender provided it. Only years later did I think it weird that his knowledge seemed so much more. I think, and I’m not sure of this, that mom must’ve still been breastfeeding him when she’d died. She might’ve even explained to him how it worked. I can honestly think of little other explanation.\n\nSuffice to say, and only years later did I learn this, my brother received no milk. And yet… for, I think, four more years did he intrude on my teeth brushing to ‘ask’/demand for more. It was never pleasant, though it became normal. For four years anyway. One night, and I’m fairly certain I was 14 and he was 10, something happened. Something changed. He was doing his usual feeding when he stopped and made a face. He said something about hurting. I said something smart in reply about being the one hurting from his biting. He ignored my reply, I believe, and repeated himself. Maybe a few times. I recall asking what hurt and he said his private parts.\n\nBy 14, I know I’d seen a porno. I’d even been in trouble for it. My friend had come over one summer day and found one to watch. It was mortifying. Worse yet, it was a pay to view one, and I know this because dad had showed me the bill some time later and I’d ratted on my friend. Dad… took it quite well, as I recall. He just said don’t watch any more of ‘them’. So, I knew what sex was. By that point, I’d felt curiosity I hadn’t felt when I was younger. I’d asked questions. I’d received answers. Mostly, I just didn’t like what I learned. But I always asked. And I always waited to hear the response.\n\nWhen my brother told me his private parts hurt, I don’t think it occurred to me that he meant in a bad way, like he needed a doctor. Some knowledge that I had lacked when I was 10 seemed absent, I think. I think I knew what he meant, so instead of going to dad to tell him my brother was in pain down there, I instead asked to see. And I did see. And it was exactly what I thought. It was morbid and mortifying. And I was mesmerized. I won’t say I didn’t touch it in that moment, my memory is murky in that regard, I think it was even… more. But after that night, I no longer allowed him to ‘breastfeed’. I kind of just ignored him. We grew apart. We don’t talk much anymore.\n\nI still think about it though. I don’t know if he does, or if he even remembers. I don’t ask. It’s something I don’t want to know. I feel sick every time it crosses my mind. But I still think about it.",

I would drink whenever I could get my hands on alcohol because it was the only way I knew how to escape. I would do all kind of stupid shit when I was drunk, try to fight people, verbally abuse people for no reason, throw up in peoples houses etc. i would often get angry at my parents for no reason and once I even had a fight with my dad. \n\n2 yrs ago aged 17 I met up with 3 girls and a male friend. I had had a lot to drink at this rate. I was sitting in a bench with one of the girls and I put my arm around her. She did not object to this so I thought I was on the next stage of flirting. I asked ro kiss her, she said no to that. A minute later I asked again and a minute after that I asked once more. All 3 times were rejected. Eventually i came to my senses and realise my attention was unwanted. I feel as though if I was physically stepping the line someone would have intervened. I cant actually remember any of this happening, this is just what I got told. I never forced myself on this person and I didn’t get aggressive or violent when rejected. After this happened she and all her friends left the venue and texted my friend that I fucked up and that no means no. I probably freaked her out bad. I didn’t understand what I was doing and I thought I was flirting but I got it horribly wrong and upset someone \n\nEveryone alienated me after this, all 4 people involved stopped talking to me. My friend was extremely angry with me and started calling me a harasser. \nDue to the response provided I have false memories of what happened. I only asked for a kiss but my mind keeps telling me that I groped/raped her because of how angry everyone was after the situation. I live in constant mental imprisonment. \nI know for a fact I had no bad intentions but in my drunken state I got it horribly wrong. \n\n\n\n When I heard about my actions the next morning I felt disgusted with myself, I instantly apologised to the girl I did it to. \nLooking back it was quite s lame apology, I said some shit like “I’m sorry if I made you feel uncomfortable last night I was really drunk” i didn’t know what to say\nShe told me she forgave me, my friend told me that she was initially upset after it had happened that I pushed her boundaries, but she accepted my apology. I don’t know if she just said this to make me feel better or what not but yeah. That was the last time i spoke to all the people involved. I feel disgusted within myself, I feel like a predator who kept pushing someone. I feel as though I might have traumatised her and ruined her life cos this was such a bad experience. It was after that I stopped drinking alcohol as a whole because I was now aware of its destructive nature. I haven’t done a thing of this nature since and realised that it was the alcohol dictating me. \n\nAfter I apologised I didn’t think too much of the incident, but 18 months later for some reason it’s come back into my mind and it’s all I think about 24/7. I really can’t understand why I did what I did. I certainly wouldn’t have done it sober, but I’ve realised that it’s no excuse. Their friend said to my friend it wasn’t that much of a big deal but I still can’t forget about it. \nI feel like a piece of shit for trying to do something without the other person’s consent. I was verbally asking for consent but I was being pushy about it. \nSince this has been of my mind, I haven’t allowed myself to have anormal life, I’ve since quit my job and I hardly leave my room. I feel as though this is who I’m gonna be forever. That drunk idiot that kept asking. I told one of my friends bout it and he said it wasn’t a big deal. I can’t even look my own mother in the eye knowing the way I treated a woman that night. No charges were ever pressed or anything, idk if I did something illegal or not but it was certainly immoral. \nI don’t know if asking for a kiss more than once is illegal (might fall under harassment) \nBut I feel I should’ve received some punishment for my actions \nI hate myself for it every day and I’ve been thinking about ending my life over this. Once u do something like this in todays society there is no going back. \n\n\nAlthough im 2 years sober and wont do something like this again I just cant let the past go. This haunts me 24/7 and honestly, I don’t think I’ll ever forgive myself for it. \nI thought of myself as an ally of women but this situation says that I wasn’t. \n\nI’m a pig. A disgusting man who ignored boundaries. I’m sorry to all women that have to deal w shit like this. I’ve heard some horror stories from some other girls and the stuff u have to put up with us disgusting. I wouldn’t consider myself a part of that domain but this encounter proves otherwise. \n\nI physically cry my eyes out when I see my mother. I’ve failed her, she told me to respect women growing up and I fucked it.",

The disk would get full of foreign coin, our job was to collect those coins put it in a bag and send it out. Anyways, after working there a while I found out that coins can be worth a lot more than face value. So, every time the machine needed assistance, I’d go clear it, collect the ones I liked and move on. One day, a 10 ounce gold krugerrand gold coin got stuck, at the time I just thought it was foreign and didn’t think much of it, until I did a little bit of research and found out it was worth over $1200 a which I sold at the bears pawn shop. That was my biggest score, flume countless coins that sold between one to a couple\n Hundred dollars",
