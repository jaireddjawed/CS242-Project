[{"title":"AskScience Panel of Scientists XXVIII","author":"AskScienceModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/askscience\/comments\/10e3nfa\/askscience_panel_of_scientists_xxviii\/","text":"**Please read this entire post carefully and format your application appropriately.**\n\nThis post is for new panelist recruitment! The previous one is [here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/askscience\/comments\/w3rut0\/askscience_panel_of_scientists_xxvii\/).\n\nThe panel is an informal group of Redditors who are **either professional scientists or those in training to become so**. All panelists have at least a graduate-level familiarity within their declared field of expertise and answer questions from related areas of study. A panelist's expertise is summarized in a color-coded AskScience flair.\n\nMembership in the panel comes with access to a panelist subreddit. It is a place for panelists to interact with each other, voice concerns to the moderators, and where the moderators make announcements to the whole panel. It's a good place to network with people who share your interests!\n\n\\-------------------\n\n**You are eligible to join the panel if you:**\n\n* Are studying for at least an MSc. or equivalent degree in the sciences, AND,\n* Are able to communicate your knowledge of your field at a level accessible to various audiences.\n\n\\-------------------\n\n**Instructions for formatting your panelist application:**\n\n* Choose exactly one general field from the side-bar (Physics, Engineering, Social Sciences, etc.).\n* State your specific field in one word or phrase (Neuropathology, Quantum Chemistry, etc.)\n* Succinctly describe your particular area of research in a few words (carbon nanotube dielectric properties, myelin sheath degradation in Parkinsons patients, etc.)\n* Give us a brief synopsis of your education: are you a research scientist for three decades, or a first-year Ph.D. student?\n* Provide links to comments you've made in AskScience which you feel are indicative of your scholarship.  Applications will not be approved without several comments made in \/r\/AskScience itself.\n\n\\-------------------\n\nIdeally, these comments should clearly indicate your fluency in the fundamentals of your discipline as well as your expertise. We favor comments that contain citations so we can assess its correctness without specific domain knowledge.\n\nHere's an example application:\n\n`Username: \/u\/foretopsail`\n\n`General field: Anthropology`\n\n`Specific field: Maritime Archaeology`\n\n`Particular areas of research include historical archaeology, archaeometry, and ship construction.`\n\n`Education: MA in archaeology, researcher for several years.`\n\n`Comments: 1, 2, 3, 4.`\n\nPlease do not give us personally identifiable information and please follow the template. We're not going to do real-life background checks - we're just asking for reddit's best behavior. However, several moderators are tasked with monitoring panelist activity, and your credentials will be checked against the academic content of your posts on a continuing basis.\n\nYou can submit your application by replying to this post.","upvote_ratio":0.89,"created_utc":1673932275.0},{"title":"What exactly is going on when a protein (or other molecule) binds with a receptor?","author":"Eat-A-Torus","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/askscience\/comments\/11oij2y\/what_exactly_is_going_on_when_a_protein_or_other\/","text":"So the sort of thing that instantly comes into my mind is like a key fitting into a lock, or like a puzzle piece connecting with a neighbor...

I get the whole \"inflating balloon\" analogy. OK.\n\nI read things about how if the universe has > critical density then it will collapse (again). Or even if it's subcritical, then it should at least be slowing down in its expansion (were it not for dark energy driving faster expansion, that is).\n\nThe explanation I typically see for an expected slowing of the expansion is that gravity is an attractive force \u2014 it should pull stuff back together. Most explanations I read tend to end there.\n\nBut **why** would you expect gravity to arrest the expansion of the universe in the first place? The expansion is **not** a conventional explosion away from a center. It's **not the case** that other galaxies are flying away with some kinetic energy that is being transformed in to gravitational potential energy. Rather, expansion is an isotropic inflation, where everything gets further away from everything else as space-time expands.\n\nIf a particular galaxy were to get pulled by gravity in a way that would cause the universe to \"slow down\" its expansion, then would direction would that be? There is no center of the universe. The gravitational forces acting on any galaxy should be (on average) isotropic (but for some clusters and large-scale structure, but I don't think that's relevant to this question).\n\n**TL;DR** \u2014 The statement \"gravity \\[should\\] slow the universe's expansion\" appears fallacious to me, and yet I see it everywhere\\*. **What I am misunderstanding?**\n\n\\* by everywhere I mean, e.g., [Forbes](https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/startswithabang\/2021\/01\/05\/how-is-the-universe-accelerating-if-the-expansion-rate-is-dropping\/?sh=385dbe044093), [Scientific American](https:\/\/www.scientificamerican.com\/article\/expanding-universe-slows-then-speeds\/), [Harvard](https:\/\/lweb.cfa.harvard.edu\/supernova\/newdata\/fate.html), many others.

I have two competing mental models of what EM radiation *actually* is from a mechanical perspective. (Turns out a \"mechanical perspective\" might not be possible which is... distressing.) \n\n1.  Photons are not EM radiation, but they have EM \"fields\" around them in the same way that, say, protons and neutrons have \"fields\" that interact with each other, and those \"fields\" are where the \"waves\" come in. These fields are not governed by particles, but are rather some vague *other thing*.  \n\nOR:  \n\n2. Photons *are* EM radiation, and they move in a straight line... but only when we're paying close attention, because wave-particle duality. They are the medium propegating the \"waves\".  \n\nI must be wrong either way. Because we can *measure* these waves in terms of length, specifically in nanometers.  \n\nI'm inclined to think that I'm closer to reality with #1 considering that [\"reducing all forces to collision\" is apparently a lost cause](https:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Action_at_a_distance) which my brain is really having trouble accepting as anything but magical thinking.  \n\nIf #1 is closer to the correct way of viewing things, you're telling me that this particular spooky action at a distance occurs over great enough distances to be expressed in nanometers? And more importantly, how can we even measure that it occurs in \"waves\" spanning nanometers?  I know it's describing a \"vector field\" but doesn't that still require some *thing* that could be detected and measued as having a velocity, and therefore momentum and mass, i.e. a bunch of particles?\n\nAnd what do photons even *do* in this context? I've seen them described as essentially a side-effect?\n\n**Edit:** I love all the discussion occuring but it's also made me realize that the body of my post mostly goes beyond the question. The question being, we're able to describe the physical wavelength in nanometers of these waves that apparently aren't oscillating in space so much as they oscillate between electric and magnetic fields.  ...how do you assign a unit of length to that?","upvote_ratio":0.88,"created_utc":1676381207.0},{"title":"Light traveling through a medium that slows it.

So, in short, it's because he has to accelerate at some point (to U-turn) that their situations are not symmetrical, and that he is indeed the one that age less.\n\nAfter that, in relativity, there is no more any notion of simultaneity, which is why the traveling twin is not getting younger (or the Earth-one older) suddenly at the exact moment of the U-turn. This part I'm having a lot of trouble grasping, but that's not the point of my question.\n\nSo, I have two question about all this:\n\n* Is his explanation \"correct\", or at least does it give the right insight about the whole thing? If not, how does this really work?\n* If he's right, and the acceleration is the root of the age difference at the end, what would happen in this hypothesis:\n\n> We are in an infinite universe without borders, where if you travel long enough straight forward, you come back to your starting point from the other side. The traveling twin hops in his rocket, take off and travel straight forward until he comes back to Earth (which has magically stayed in the same place and still exists, don't question it too far) from the other side.

Yet its closely-related cousin relapsing fever, while not as prevalent, has actually been foundational in the study of vector-borne diseases. Largely unknown today, the story of relapsing fever is a fascinating exploration of scientific research that contains important lessons for modern medicine.\n\nJoin us today at 2 PM ET (19 UT) for a discussion, organized by the American Society for Microbiology (ASM), all about relapsing fever. We hope to shine a light on the mechanism and biology of relapsing fever, and to highlight how research on forgotten and ignored diseases can have real impact on health and medical advances.\n\nWith us today are:\n\n+ Dr. Phil Stewart, Ph.D. (u\/Mercurialdrifter)- Rocky Mountain Laboratories, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health.\n+ Dr. Tom Schwan, Ph.D. (u\/Argasidae)- Special Volunteer, Rocky Mountain Laboratories, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health.\n\nLinks:\n\n+ [CDC Relapsing Fever page](https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/relapsing-fever\/index.html)\n+ [Relapsing Fever: Modern Lessons from an Ancient Disease](https:\/\/asm.org\/Articles\/2023\/Relapsing-Fever-Modern-Lessons-from-an-Ancient-Dis)\n+ [MSF medical guidelines](https:\/\/medicalguidelines.msf.org\/en\/viewport\/CG\/english\/relapsing-fever-borreliosis-16689945.html?language_content_entity=en)\n+ [Dr. Tom G Schwan Oral History](https:\/\/history.nih.gov\/display\/history\/Schwan%2C+Tom+G+2021)","upvote_ratio":0.9,"created_utc":1675769970.0},{"title":"Why aren't anabolic steroids\/HGH prescribed for patients recovering from wounds\/grafts?

My name is Tareq Abu Hamed. I am originally from East Jerusalem, and I hold a PhD in chemical engineering from Ankara University. I did my first post doctorate research at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel, where I worked at the Environmental Sciences and Energy Research Department. My second post doctorate was at the University of Minnesota, at the Solar Energy Laboratory of the Mechanical Engineering Department. I have published in a wide variety of journals and have received several awards for my research, including the Dan David Prize. Previously, I served as the Deputy Chief Scientist and the Director of Engineering Research at The Ministry of Science, Technology and Space. I also established the Center for Renewable Energy and Energy Conservation at the Arava Institute. I am currently the Executive Director of the Arava Institute and a researcher at the Dead Sea and Arava Science Center.\n\nYou can read about my role as Deputy Chief Scientist here: https:\/\/www.haaretz.com\/science-and-health\/2015-03-22\/ty-article\/east-jlem-palestinian-tapped-deputy-chief-scientist\/0000017f-e34c-d568-ad7f-f36f0f2a0000\n\nThe Middle East is a global hot spot for climate change and environmental stress on water, energy, agriculture, health and other necessities. Many cities in our region are predicted to become uninhabitable by the end of the century. In recognition of this pressing reality, the Arava Institute for Environmental Studies is conducting a variety of academic and research projects that combines regional environmental diplomatic activity, academic research, and the initiation and execution of projects throughout the Middle East.\n\nOne of our great projects is Methuselah. Methuselah is a date palm that Dr. Elaine Solowey sprouted from a 2,000-year-old date seed. This seed, among others, was found during the excavations of Masada in the mid 1960's. In 2005, several of these seeds were obtained by the Louis L. Borick Natural Medicine Research Center of the Hadassah Medical Organization, which gave them to Dr. Elaine Solowey at the Center for Sustainable Agriculture. Dr. Solowey successfully germinated one of these seeds, which sprouted into a young date palm.\n\nInitially thought to be botanically impossible, this successful project has been featured in the New York Times, National Geographic, and other publications. Today, Methuselah has a permanent home in the Arava Institute research park on Kibbutz Ketura.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/aravainstitute\/videos\/387142179880188\/\nwww.arava.org\nhttps:\/\/arava.org\/2022\/12\/post-cop27-with-tareq-abu-hamed\/\n\nWe'll be online from 12-1:30 p.m. PT (3-4:30 p.m. ET, 20-20:0 UT) to answer your questions!\n\nUsernames: \/u\/israelinsf","upvote_ratio":0.9,"created_utc":1674475257.0},{"title":"Can sedimentary rock for on land?","author":"24_Elsinore","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/askscience\/comments\/10kfowd\/can_sedimentary_rock_for_on_land\/","text":"Hi there. I am not a geologist, and most of my knowledge has come from seminars on soils or reading online sources. So I am here to ask a question of geologists that I am having trouble finding online.\n\nLithification of marine sediments appears to be the most common process in the creation of sedimentary rock. It's quite easy to find information on this. However, I have found very little information on whether there are terrestrial processes that create sedimentary rock on land. One could assume that the relative absence of information means it doesn't happen, but I don't want to assume that just because I can't easily find the information means it doesn't happen. So, are there any types of sedimentary rock that form in terrestrial environments, and what are the processes? I have read about cements and conglomerates, are those typically the only ones?\n\nGenerally it seems that lithification happens in marine environments, the rock is then uplifted into the terrestrial environment, where it then erodes back to the sea. Does lithification generally not happen on land because the accumulation of new sediment is not enough to replace or overtake sediment loss to erosion?\n\nI'd appreciate any pieces of information or sources on this.
