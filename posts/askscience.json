The previous one is [here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/askscience\/comments\/w3rut0\/askscience_panel_of_scientists_xxvii\/).\n\nThe panel is an informal group of Redditors who are **either professional scientists or those in training to become so**. All panelists have at least a graduate-level familiarity within their declared field of expertise and answer questions from related areas of study. A panelist's expertise is summarized in a color-coded AskScience flair.\n\nMembership in the panel comes with access to a panelist subreddit. It is a place for panelists to interact with each other, voice concerns to the moderators, and where the moderators make announcements to the whole panel. It's a good place to network with people who share your interests!\n\n\\-------------------\n\n**You are eligible to join the panel if you:**\n\n* Are studying for at least an MSc. or equivalent degree in the sciences, AND,\n* Are able to communicate your knowledge of your field at a level accessible to various audiences.\n\n\\-------------------\n\n**Instructions for formatting your panelist application:**\n\n* Choose exactly one general field from the side-bar (Physics, Engineering, Social Sciences, etc.).\n* State your specific field in one word or phrase (Neuropathology, Quantum Chemistry, etc.)\n* Succinctly describe your particular area of research in a few words (carbon nanotube dielectric properties, myelin sheath degradation in Parkinsons patients, etc.)\n* Give us a brief synopsis of your education: are you a research scientist for three decades, or a first-year Ph.D. student?\n* Provide links to comments you've made in AskScience which you feel are indicative of your scholarship.  Applications will not be approved without several comments made in \/r\/AskScience itself.\n\n\\-------------------\n\nIdeally, these comments should clearly indicate your fluency in the fundamentals of your discipline as well as your expertise. We favor comments that contain citations so we can assess its correctness without specific domain knowledge.\n\nHere's an example application:\n\n`Username: \/u\/foretopsail`\n\n`General field: Anthropology`\n\n`Specific field: Maritime Archaeology`\n\n`Particular areas of research include historical archaeology, archaeometry, and ship construction.`\n\n`Education: MA in archaeology, researcher for several years.`\n\n`Comments: 1, 2, 3, 4.`\n\nPlease do not give us personally identifiable information and please follow the template. We're not going to do real-life background checks - we're just asking for reddit's best behavior. However, several moderators are tasked with monitoring panelist activity, and your credentials will be checked against the academic content of your posts on a continuing basis.\n\nYou can submit your application by replying to this post.","upvote_ratio":0.89,"created_utc":1673932275.0},{"title":"Will black holes turn into something else once they\u2019ve \u201cconsumed\u201denough of what\u2019s around them?","author":"B00MBAB00M","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/askscience\/comments\/11q8pei\/will_black_holes_turn_into_something_else_once\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.92,"created_utc":1678711505.0},{"title":"Why were the control rods in the reactor featured in the HBO series 'Chernobyl' (2019) tipped with graphite?","author":"Figorama","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/askscience\/comments\/11pzjx4\/why_were_the_control_rods_in_the_reactor_featured\/","text":"In one episode of the series the protagonist, Legasov, explains the function of the safety protocol AZ5 that forces the boron control rods to descend into the reactor.

It becomes active, then goes dormant again, and repeats. Maybe you don't notice symptoms but the immune system is battling it when it acts up, which likely causes colllateral damage. Let's say you now boost your immune system by healthy habits like exercising, cold showers, healthy food and whatnot. Is it possible for the immune system to fully eradicate a chronic infection because it is now 'capable' somehow of doing things that it previously couldn't? Maybe it detects the dormant guys when before it couldn't? Kinda like how a person with AIDS will catch infections easily, but in reverse.  \n\n**EDIT**: So I feel like many people are misinterpreting a 'boosted' or 'stronger' immune system as one that recklessly attacks everything. That's not what I meant. Stronger refers to 'an increased ability to detect what is and what is not part of the body'. Chronic infections are allowed to exist because the body doesn't recognize that the infection is not supposed to be there. Making the system stronger is meant as saying, making the system being able to recognize these pathogens better, so they can be removed.","upvote_ratio":0.9,"created_utc":1678571632.0},{"title":"There are certain species of mushrooms that can't be cultivated artificially and only found naturally in the wild, are there also any plants that are unable to be grown artificially?","author":"PianoTrumpetMax","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/askscience\/comments\/11phmqk\/there_are_certain_species_of_mushrooms_that_cant\/","text":"I was watching a Youtube video and they mention that Amanita muscaria has not been grown artificially by humans.

So my thought is: \"even if diabetes rates have increased in the country how do they know if statistics were so much unexistent?\"\n\nThis all leads me to my broader question, in the title, that is, do these growth analysis generally take in consideration increase in knowledge about the population. I take the opportunity to go further and ask, if so, how exactly is it done and how accurate are they?","upvote_ratio":0.69,"created_utc":1678482454.0},{"title":"What are the selection pressures for RNA to DNA?

Photons are not EM radiation, but they have EM \"fields\" around them in the same way that, say, protons and neutrons have \"fields\" that interact with each other, and those \"fields\" are where the \"waves\" come in. These fields are not governed by particles, but are rather some vague *other thing*.  \n\nOR:  \n\n2. Photons *are* EM radiation, and they move in a straight line... but only when we're paying close attention, because wave-particle duality.

And more importantly, how can we even measure that it occurs in \"waves\" spanning nanometers?  I know it's describing a \"vector field\" but doesn't that still require some *thing* that could be detected and measued as having a velocity, and therefore momentum and mass, i.e. a bunch of particles?\n\nAnd what do photons even *do* in this context?

I'm not that smart of a person, and I just know the basics in most science fields. Just think of me as a 5 year old trying to understand the world around him.\n\nI'm trying to understand the twin paradox, and I've stumbled upon [this video](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=T-z_zRcLGAk&ab_channel=ScienceEtonnante) (in french, but automatic English translation is quite good), where he explains that the paradox is resolved by the fact that the situations of the two twins are not really symmetrical, despite of what we think, because the traveling twin has to U-turn at some point, and doing so subjects him to an acceleration (at [16:11](https:\/\/youtu.be\/T-z_zRcLGAk?t=971)). So, in short, it's because he has to accelerate at some point (to U-turn) that their situations are not symmetrical, and that he is indeed the one that age less.\n\nAfter that, in relativity, there is no more any notion of simultaneity, which is why the traveling twin is not getting younger (or the Earth-one older) suddenly at the exact moment of the U-turn. This part I'm having a lot of trouble grasping, but that's not the point of my question.\n\nSo, I have two question about all this:\n\n* Is his explanation \"correct\", or at least does it give the right insight about the whole thing? If not, how does this really work?\n* If he's right, and the acceleration is the root of the age difference at the end, what would happen in this hypothesis:\n\n> We are in an infinite universe without borders, where if you travel long enough straight forward, you come back to your starting point from the other side. The traveling twin hops in his rocket, take off and travel straight forward until he comes back to Earth (which has magically stayed in the same place and still exists, don't question it too far) from the other side. He has not made any U-turn, so in theory, I guess their situations are still symmetrical.\n\nWhich one would have age more, and why?","upvote_ratio":0.76,"created_utc":1676295329.0},{"title":"Is it true the humans could breathe and live in the atmosphere of Venus?","author":"Impossible_Mine_1616","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/askscience\/comments\/111gzwp\/is_it_true_the_humans_could_breathe_and_live_in\/","text":"I think I read somewhere that in a layer of the atmosphere of Venus the temperature and air are completely sustainable for human life.

Why not already at 5pm when it's already dark especially without having electrical light at that time. That applies to the summer time as well? Why having to bring a lit lantern at 10pm when there is still enough daylight so you wouldn't need a lantern. At least from todays perspective. And on top of that it's even more confusing if you take in account that we have winter and summer time. In the past winter time would be the normal time (UTC+1). Hence my question: How consistent is  the yearly cycle of varying daylight duration from day to day throughout the year in a historical view? Was it the same in 16th century as today? Did it change throughout the millenia? And if so, how much did it change?","upvote_ratio":0.88,"created_utc":1675593100.0},{"title":"Understanding that deuterium and tritium are simply isotopes of hydrogen, is there an equivalent periodic table that shows all known elements and their isotopes?","author":null,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/askscience\/comments\/10uemz6\/understanding_that_deuterium_and_tritium_are\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.93,"created_utc":1675609667.0},{"title":"Do tonal language speakers understand each other while whispering?","author":"Paulix_05","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/askscience\/comments\/10uai6n\/do_tonal_language_speakers_understand_each_other\/","text":"I mean, how do they convey tone information without using their vocal cords?","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1675596893.0},{"title":"Why oil fries, while water boils?","author":"SaboKunn","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/askscience\/comments\/10ud0uz\/why_oil_fries_while_water_boils\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.83,"created_utc":1675605362.0},{"title":"When does the body store fat?","author":"fappie6","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/askscience\/comments\/10u9ozz\/when_does_the_body_store_fat\/","text":"Like at night when you sleep or what? cause obviously you dont get fat like right after you eat a piece of chocolate or something.

My second post doctorate was at the University of Minnesota, at the Solar Energy Laboratory of the Mechanical Engineering Department. I have published in a wide variety of journals and have received several awards for my research, including the Dan David Prize. Previously, I served as the Deputy Chief Scientist and the Director of Engineering Research at The Ministry of Science, Technology and Space. I also established the Center for Renewable Energy and Energy Conservation at the Arava Institute.

Many cities in our region are predicted to become uninhabitable by the end of the century. In recognition of this pressing reality, the Arava Institute for Environmental Studies is conducting a variety of academic and research projects that combines regional environmental diplomatic activity, academic research, and the initiation and execution of projects throughout the Middle East.\n\nOne of our great projects is Methuselah. Methuselah is a date palm that Dr. Elaine Solowey sprouted from a 2,000-year-old date seed. This seed, among others, was found during the excavations of Masada in the mid 1960's. In 2005, several of these seeds were obtained by the Louis L. Borick Natural Medicine Research Center of the Hadassah Medical Organization, which gave them to Dr. Elaine Solowey at the Center for Sustainable Agriculture. Dr. Solowey successfully germinated one of these seeds, which sprouted into a young date palm.\n\nInitially thought to be botanically impossible, this successful project has been featured in the New York Times, National Geographic, and other publications. Today, Methuselah has a permanent home in the Arava Institute research park on Kibbutz Ketura.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/aravainstitute\/videos\/387142179880188\/\nwww.arava.org\nhttps:\/\/arava.org\/2022\/12\/post-cop27-with-tareq-abu-hamed\/\n\nWe'll be online from 12-1:30 p.m. PT (3-4:30 p.m. ET, 20-20:0 UT) to answer your questions!\n\nUsernames: \/u\/israelinsf","upvote_ratio":0.9,"created_utc":1674475257.0},{"title":"Can sedimentary rock for on land?","author":"24_Elsinore","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/askscience\/comments\/10kfowd\/can_sedimentary_rock_for_on_land\/","text":"Hi there. I am not a geologist, and most of my knowledge has come from seminars on soils or reading online sources. So I am here to ask a question of geologists that I am having trouble finding online.\n\nLithification of marine sediments appears to be the most common process in the creation of sedimentary rock. It's quite easy to find information on this. However, I have found very little information on whether there are terrestrial processes that create sedimentary rock on land. One could assume that the relative absence of information means it doesn't happen, but I don't want to assume that just because I can't easily find the information means it doesn't happen. So, are there any types of sedimentary rock that form in terrestrial environments, and what are the processes? I have read about cements and conglomerates, are those typically the only ones?\n\nGenerally it seems that lithification happens in marine environments, the rock is then uplifted into the terrestrial environment, where it then erodes back to the sea.

So I was imagining that refraction between water and air as well as internal reflection of the droplets is what causes the light to reach our eyes, not that the sky lights up like a light bulb does.\n\nI also argued that different points on Earth would receive varying levels of light from each strike because of the random nature of water droplets and the structure they happen to form at that moment. So whether a particular strike is bright depends on where you are, not just the amount of energy released. (because different places would receive different numbers of rays, so the sky looks a different brightness.

I was having a discussion with a friend about snakes and how they go about digesting their food. We kept using the frame of reference that food goes in through our mouths, then through the digestive tracks of the stomach, then eventually out. We figured snakes were the same way, except their digestive tracks are part of their elongated bodies.\n\nThen I started wondering, does food go in one direction then? Is it through the mouth, then slowly pushing toward the tail, where their output mechanism gets rid of it? Or is it through time, the food shifts from going outward towards the tail and upward towards the head, almost like a thrashing, until the food is broken up enough to exit the system?\n\nI'm not sure of these answers. This might be a dumb question on my part. Just curious though.\n\nHow do snakes digest their food?\n\nDo snakes use a more powerful acid they have to break down food than humans have?  Is there a rate at which the average snake passes food matter from one stage to the next? If so, how does that rate compare with humans, as its a smaller system?\n\nI'd figure if that were the case, it would be a shorter time span to eat and output waste for a snake, than it is a human, but then again, that could be wrong, maybe its not relative to the size of the system, but the differences in the digestion process from snake to human and back. Who knows?\n\nMight as well ask yall though lol.

Suppose I want to lift a mass to an orbit of some altitude, I can compute what energy the system has to have once it's in orbit; what's the best way to generate that?   \n\n\nSuppose you launch with low power; then you spend more time in a higher gravitational field which means you're counteracting gravity for a longer period of time. I assume that minimizing the integral over time of the force of gravity on the vehicle would save you fuel, which saves weight which saves you fuel... (I assume this converges)  \n\n\nSuppose you launch with very high power; you accelerate quickly out of the gravitational force but then air resistance becomes an issue and with too much velocity any additional increase in velocity requires O(x\\^3) power. At some point it's not efficient to add more power because you'll need a lot more fuel.   \n\n\nIn both of these cases the higher you are the lower those forces are; so maybe a launch system which has a lot more power early and cuts the power later is useful (SRBs are useful here).   \n\n\nNow, if you build a rocket or launch system with more engines you incur more weight that you're trying to move, also bad. Along with this is the weight of the fuel which goes down over time. The more fuel you have also starts to incur more non-usable weight for the fuel tanks.   \n\n\nI presume that the effects of wind resistance and gravity create non-linearities in the system since the forces acting at time t are functions of altitude. Is there a model that's used to get started and then iterated on once certain discrete parameters are figured in (that is, you can't add 0.5 engines)?\n\nEdit: I\u2019m familiar with both KSP and the rocket equation. The problem of designing the system seems like a optimizing a function described by a non-linear differential equation which I assume probably doesn\u2019t have an analytical solution. I\u2019m curious about what things get modeled and which don\u2019t and how this is actually done in practice.","upvote_ratio":0.79,"created_utc":1672952149.0},{"title":"Using a CPAP can increase the life span of a Sleep Apnea patient by 7 years.

(and more on pulse lasing)","author":"throwaway300650","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/askscience\/comments\/102d3qg\/how_does_qswitching_work_and_more_on_pulse_lasing\/","text":" I'm learning about different methods to create short, powerful pulses in lasers, and am currently learning methods Q-switching and Mode-locking. I have questions about both of them, spawned from reading lecture notes.\n\n**The first questions have to do with Q-Switching:**\n\nThey have to do with this part of a reading my lecture notes:\n\n\"In a Q-switched laser we stop the laser from oscillating by altering some property of the laser cavity (otherwise known as changing the cavity quality \u2013 hence Q!). As an example, we might use a device that misaligns the beam in the cavity preventing lasing. The cavity now has a low Q. This allows the population of the upper laser level to build up and means that the signal is not being fed back into the oscillator so no lasing occurs. A fast switch then changes the alignment of the cavity to a high Q value. This allows the oscillation to take place and the pulse to be released.\"\n\n* Is my assumption right that, in order for this to be achieved, \"stopping the laser from oscillating\" refers to stopping photons from entering the gain medium, hitting a resonator, hitting the gain medium, hitting the other resonator? So, moving the resonator slightly will prevent that, as a photon will hit the resonator that's curved and not hit the other one since the trajectory doesn't allow for it (although that sounds classical.. and photons don't move classically). And what is the oscillator, in this case?\n* From what I gather, this is my interpretation: if we tilt a resonator, the photons don't gain properly. This causes emitted photons to hit the gain medium, (The emitted photons from the pump, I'd assume... which I'm not sure if is pumped constantly or pulsed here.. since I know this has to do with pulse emission but I'll explain why I'm not sure if it's pulsed pumping or constant pumping) and then not oscillate back. This means less photons hit the gain, causing less stimulated emission and more electrons sitting at a lasing band, with their high decay time. So, without any incident photons, they're more likely to stay there. Then.. I suppose.. from adjusting the \"Q value\", by aligning the mirror perfectly and fast, we get that needed amount of incident photons, and that cluster of lasing band electrons all undergo stimulated emission in close to at the same time? What gaps do I have in this?\n\n**The second question has to do with Mode-locking**\n\nModelocking has to do with introducing a ton of longitudinal modes of different wavelengths into the cavity. These waves, when superposed, seem to tend to create one larger peak spike when added. This also appears in beats with sound. Why exactly is this? I've heard it may have something to do with Fourier analysis?\n\n**Finally, I have three small questions on general pulse lasing**\n\nGain switching is described in my lecture notes as \"we simply control how long we supply energy to the laser for, and thus how long the laser remains above threshold for. As the laser only emits when the gain > loss, so a pulse of light may be formed.\" How does this create a pulse? To me this sounds akin to holding my hand over a flashlight and then quickly removing and putting my hand back to cover it. This doesn't seem like when I remove my hand more light will come out, the same but for a different amount of time. Not more power or anything we think of with pulsed lasers. According to this diagram, Pulse-Repetition Frequency is defined as 1\/Tinterval (Am I write in assuming an amount of displacement t on this graph is referred to as time bandwidth? If not, what is it?) Where is the intuition behind this?\n\n[https:\/\/i.stack.imgur.com\/aISLv.png](https:\/\/i.stack.imgur.com\/aISLv.png)\n\nOne more question. Thanks very much for bearing with me. Am I right in assuming this graph has to do with the varied amounts of intensities with the necessary gain, when going through both resonators and through the gain medium, produce net output gain? What do those arrows represent, (lasing modes.. huh?) and what explains the general curved figure of the graph?\n\n[https:\/\/i.stack.imgur.com\/DhWO3.png](https:\/\/i.stack.imgur.com\/DhWO3.png)\n\nI appreciate any time taken to help answer these. I'm new to the subject but it's intriguing, so I'd like to know exactly what is going on so I can develop a sense of pride for this thing.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1672765085.0},{"title":"Molecularly, what make pine pitch sticky?","author":"orangegore","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/askscience\/comments\/101tp1t\/molecularly_what_make_pine_pitch_sticky\/","text":"When you get pine or fir pitch on your thumb and index finger, what makes it  adhere and resist pulling your fingers apart? \nAlso, is the pitch molecularly homogenous?","upvote_ratio":0.74,"created_utc":1672708068.0},{"title":"How do galaxies move?","author":"modsarebrainstems","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/askscience\/comments\/1018gn0\/how_do_galaxies_move\/","text":"I'm a little confused about galactic movement in that we all know the universe is expanding like raisins in a loaf of bread.

After adjusting the pH to 5.0 with 5 M HCl, 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethyl-aminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride was added. The final concentrations of native gelatin, ethylenediamine, and 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethyl-aminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride in the resultant solution were 20, 56, and 10.7 mg\/mL, respectively. The resultant solution was incubated at 37\u00b0C for 18 hr, followed by dialysis against purified water for 48 hr, and then freeze-dried to obtain the aminated gelatin. The numbers of primary amino groups introduced into the native cationic and aminated gelatin were measured by the TNBS method (Snyder and Sobocinski 1975). The amino group contents of the native cationic gelatin and aminated gelatin were 0.33 and 0.64 mmol\/g, respectively.\n\nPreparation of Gelatin Microspheres\n\nNGMS and CGMS were prepared by glutaraldehyde cross-linking in the dispersed state of an aqueous gelatin solution in the oil phase by a modification of the method of Tabata and Ikada (1989). Briefly, 1 mL native cationic or aminated gelatin aqueous solution (10 wt%, preheated to 40\u00b0C) was added dropwise to 25 mL olive oil and then emulsified by vortex-mixing to yield a water-in-oil emulsion. The emulsion temperature was dropped to 4\u00b0C, then 7.5 mL cold acetone was added to the emulsion and stirring was continued for 1 hr to induce gel formation. The resulting microspheres were collected by centrifugation (2500\u00d7 g, 4\u00b0C, 5 min) and washed three times with acetone. The cross-linking of the microspheres was carried out using 0.06% glutaraldehyde in acetone\/0.01 M HCl solution (7:3) at 4\u00b0C for the indicated time. Following collection by centrifugation (2500\u00d7 g, 4\u00b0C, 5 min), the microspheres were agitated in 10 mM aqueous glycine solution at room temperature for 1 hr to block the residual aldehyde groups of the unreacted glutaraldehyde. The resulting microspheres were finally washed three times with purified water by centrifugation and then freeze-dried.\u201d\n\nFrom Millipore Sigma\u2019s website \u201cPhysical Properties: Type A gelatin has 78-80 millimoles of free carboxyl groups per 100 g of protein and a pI of 7.0-9.5.\u201d\n\nWhat does it mean when there\u2019s a range for the isoelectric point? Does it mean that using the procedure from the paper, it can increase type A gelatin\u2019 s isoelectric point to be closer to 9.5? From the second paragraph, are microspheres just powders? Would it be soluble in water? Lastly, is an isoelectric point the same as a pH point of zero charge?

I carried out post-doctoral research at University of California Davis and Rutgers University and spent three years as a visiting professor at Harvard and Cornell universities. I published over 100 peer reviewed studies and supervised over 50 students and post docs from all over the world, of which most have continued either in academic or industrial research.\n\nThe overall goal of my research is to explore adaptation and acclimation mechanisms of plants to the desert environment in both natural and agricultural vegetation. Understanding tolerance mechanisms of plants grown in desert environments is invaluable for increasing the genetic pool of tolerant plants for agriculture and for maintaining biodiversity in natural ecosystems. A focus of this research is the root system and the interaction between roots and shoots that enable plants to prosper in drylands. The lab takes advantage of its location in the desert and studies the surrounding natural and agricultural ecosystems. I collaborate with many researchers and receive research grants from different foundations, including the Israeli Science Foundation, BARD, and Ministry of Agriculture.

One D-T fusion reaction produces one neutron, and one neutron causes one Lithium-6 nucleus to produce a Tritium ion -- for this to work, it seems we are requiring perfect 100% efficiency of fusion neutrons producing Lithium fuel.

I know that, in the world of genetically engineered bacteria, it's hard to keep a trait stable over many generations of bacteria.  If the trait isn't necessary for the bacteria's survival, it often mutates away.  Genetic engineers often tie interesting traits to a separate trait for bacterial resistance, and then expose the bacteria to antibiotics to select (in theory) for just the bacteria that have an intact version of the special trait and the associated resistance.\n\nI'm curious about what happens if you take a bacteria strain, like MRSA, that has evolved a resistance to drugs in the methicillin family, and then culture it in an environment where it's not exposed to any antibiotics.

If the culture loses resistance over time, and then you expose the culture to methicillin again, does the culture re-gain resistance faster, than, say, a naive strain of S. aureus that's never developed resistance in the first place?

The previous one is [here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/askscience\/comments\/w3rut0\/askscience_panel_of_scientists_xxvii\/).\n\nThe panel is an informal group of Redditors who are **either professional scientists or those in training to become so**. All panelists have at least a graduate-level familiarity within their declared field of expertise and answer questions from related areas of study. A panelist's expertise is summarized in a color-coded AskScience flair.\n\nMembership in the panel comes with access to a panelist subreddit. It is a place for panelists to interact with each other, voice concerns to the moderators, and where the moderators make announcements to the whole panel. It's a good place to network with people who share your interests!\n\n\\-------------------\n\n**You are eligible to join the panel if you:**\n\n* Are studying for at least an MSc. or equivalent degree in the sciences, AND,\n* Are able to communicate your knowledge of your field at a level accessible to various audiences.\n\n\\-------------------\n\n**Instructions for formatting your panelist application:**\n\n* Choose exactly one general field from the side-bar (Physics, Engineering, Social Sciences, etc.).\n* State your specific field in one word or phrase (Neuropathology, Quantum Chemistry, etc.)\n* Succinctly describe your particular area of research in a few words (carbon nanotube dielectric properties, myelin sheath degradation in Parkinsons patients, etc.)\n* Give us a brief synopsis of your education: are you a research scientist for three decades, or a first-year Ph.D. student?\n* Provide links to comments you've made in AskScience which you feel are indicative of your scholarship.  Applications will not be approved without several comments made in \/r\/AskScience itself.\n\n\\-------------------\n\nIdeally, these comments should clearly indicate your fluency in the fundamentals of your discipline as well as your expertise. We favor comments that contain citations so we can assess its correctness without specific domain knowledge.\n\nHere's an example application:\n\n`Username: \/u\/foretopsail`\n\n`General field: Anthropology`\n\n`Specific field: Maritime Archaeology`\n\n`Particular areas of research include historical archaeology, archaeometry, and ship construction.`\n\n`Education: MA in archaeology, researcher for several years.`\n\n`Comments: 1, 2, 3, 4.`\n\nPlease do not give us personally identifiable information and please follow the template. We're not going to do real-life background checks - we're just asking for reddit's best behavior. However, several moderators are tasked with monitoring panelist activity, and your credentials will be checked against the academic content of your posts on a continuing basis.\n\nYou can submit your application by replying to this post.","upvote_ratio":0.89,"created_utc":1673932275.0},{"title":"What exactly is going on when a protein (or other molecule) binds with a receptor?","author":"Eat-A-Torus","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/askscience\/comments\/11oij2y\/what_exactly_is_going_on_when_a_protein_or_other\/","text":"So the sort of thing that instantly comes into my mind is like a key fitting into a lock, or like a puzzle piece connecting with a neighbor...

This whole process is such a cataclysm that it destroys Pangea and reshapes the lands.\nI need some kind of clues to know how I can reshape this world and how this new satellite influence this.\n\nThanks !","upvote_ratio":0.91,"created_utc":1678197694.0},{"title":"How has the number of humans who have ever lived been estimated?

I get the whole \"inflating balloon\" analogy. OK.\n\nI read things about how if the universe has > critical density then it will collapse (again). Or even if it's subcritical, then it should at least be slowing down in its expansion (were it not for dark energy driving faster expansion, that is).\n\nThe explanation I typically see for an expected slowing of the expansion is that gravity is an attractive force \u2014 it should pull stuff back together. Most explanations I read tend to end there.\n\nBut **why** would you expect gravity to arrest the expansion of the universe in the first place? The expansion is **not** a conventional explosion away from a center. It's **not the case** that other galaxies are flying away with some kinetic energy that is being transformed in to gravitational potential energy. Rather, expansion is an isotropic inflation, where everything gets further away from everything else as space-time expands.\n\nIf a particular galaxy were to get pulled by gravity in a way that would cause the universe to \"slow down\" its expansion, then would direction would that be? There is no center of the universe. The gravitational forces acting on any galaxy should be (on average) isotropic (but for some clusters and large-scale structure, but I don't think that's relevant to this question).\n\n**TL;DR** \u2014 The statement \"gravity \\[should\\] slow the universe's expansion\" appears fallacious to me, and yet I see it everywhere\\*. **What I am misunderstanding?**\n\n\\* by everywhere I mean, e.g., [Forbes](https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/startswithabang\/2021\/01\/05\/how-is-the-universe-accelerating-if-the-expansion-rate-is-dropping\/?sh=385dbe044093), [Scientific American](https:\/\/www.scientificamerican.com\/article\/expanding-universe-slows-then-speeds\/), [Harvard](https:\/\/lweb.cfa.harvard.edu\/supernova\/newdata\/fate.html), many others.

I have two competing mental models of what EM radiation *actually* is from a mechanical perspective. (Turns out a \"mechanical perspective\" might not be possible which is... distressing.) \n\n1.  Photons are not EM radiation, but they have EM \"fields\" around them in the same way that, say, protons and neutrons have \"fields\" that interact with each other, and those \"fields\" are where the \"waves\" come in. These fields are not governed by particles, but are rather some vague *other thing*.  \n\nOR:  \n\n2. Photons *are* EM radiation, and they move in a straight line... but only when we're paying close attention, because wave-particle duality. They are the medium propegating the \"waves\".  \n\nI must be wrong either way. Because we can *measure* these waves in terms of length, specifically in nanometers.  \n\nI'm inclined to think that I'm closer to reality with #1 considering that [\"reducing all forces to collision\" is apparently a lost cause](https:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Action_at_a_distance) which my brain is really having trouble accepting as anything but magical thinking.  \n\nIf #1 is closer to the correct way of viewing things, you're telling me that this particular spooky action at a distance occurs over great enough distances to be expressed in nanometers? And more importantly, how can we even measure that it occurs in \"waves\" spanning nanometers?  I know it's describing a \"vector field\" but doesn't that still require some *thing* that could be detected and measued as having a velocity, and therefore momentum and mass, i.e. a bunch of particles?\n\nAnd what do photons even *do* in this context? I've seen them described as essentially a side-effect?\n\n**Edit:** I love all the discussion occuring but it's also made me realize that the body of my post mostly goes beyond the question. The question being, we're able to describe the physical wavelength in nanometers of these waves that apparently aren't oscillating in space so much as they oscillate between electric and magnetic fields.  ...how do you assign a unit of length to that?","upvote_ratio":0.88,"created_utc":1676381207.0},{"title":"Light traveling through a medium that slows it.

So, in short, it's because he has to accelerate at some point (to U-turn) that their situations are not symmetrical, and that he is indeed the one that age less.\n\nAfter that, in relativity, there is no more any notion of simultaneity, which is why the traveling twin is not getting younger (or the Earth-one older) suddenly at the exact moment of the U-turn. This part I'm having a lot of trouble grasping, but that's not the point of my question.\n\nSo, I have two question about all this:\n\n* Is his explanation \"correct\", or at least does it give the right insight about the whole thing? If not, how does this really work?\n* If he's right, and the acceleration is the root of the age difference at the end, what would happen in this hypothesis:\n\n> We are in an infinite universe without borders, where if you travel long enough straight forward, you come back to your starting point from the other side. The traveling twin hops in his rocket, take off and travel straight forward until he comes back to Earth (which has magically stayed in the same place and still exists, don't question it too far) from the other side.

Yet its closely-related cousin relapsing fever, while not as prevalent, has actually been foundational in the study of vector-borne diseases. Largely unknown today, the story of relapsing fever is a fascinating exploration of scientific research that contains important lessons for modern medicine.\n\nJoin us today at 2 PM ET (19 UT) for a discussion, organized by the American Society for Microbiology (ASM), all about relapsing fever. We hope to shine a light on the mechanism and biology of relapsing fever, and to highlight how research on forgotten and ignored diseases can have real impact on health and medical advances.\n\nWith us today are:\n\n+ Dr. Phil Stewart, Ph.D. (u\/Mercurialdrifter)- Rocky Mountain Laboratories, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health.\n+ Dr. Tom Schwan, Ph.D. (u\/Argasidae)- Special Volunteer, Rocky Mountain Laboratories, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health.\n\nLinks:\n\n+ [CDC Relapsing Fever page](https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/relapsing-fever\/index.html)\n+ [Relapsing Fever: Modern Lessons from an Ancient Disease](https:\/\/asm.org\/Articles\/2023\/Relapsing-Fever-Modern-Lessons-from-an-Ancient-Dis)\n+ [MSF medical guidelines](https:\/\/medicalguidelines.msf.org\/en\/viewport\/CG\/english\/relapsing-fever-borreliosis-16689945.html?language_content_entity=en)\n+ [Dr. Tom G Schwan Oral History](https:\/\/history.nih.gov\/display\/history\/Schwan%2C+Tom+G+2021)","upvote_ratio":0.9,"created_utc":1675769970.0},{"title":"Why aren't anabolic steroids\/HGH prescribed for patients recovering from wounds\/grafts?

My name is Tareq Abu Hamed. I am originally from East Jerusalem, and I hold a PhD in chemical engineering from Ankara University. I did my first post doctorate research at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel, where I worked at the Environmental Sciences and Energy Research Department. My second post doctorate was at the University of Minnesota, at the Solar Energy Laboratory of the Mechanical Engineering Department. I have published in a wide variety of journals and have received several awards for my research, including the Dan David Prize. Previously, I served as the Deputy Chief Scientist and the Director of Engineering Research at The Ministry of Science, Technology and Space. I also established the Center for Renewable Energy and Energy Conservation at the Arava Institute. I am currently the Executive Director of the Arava Institute and a researcher at the Dead Sea and Arava Science Center.\n\nYou can read about my role as Deputy Chief Scientist here: https:\/\/www.haaretz.com\/science-and-health\/2015-03-22\/ty-article\/east-jlem-palestinian-tapped-deputy-chief-scientist\/0000017f-e34c-d568-ad7f-f36f0f2a0000\n\nThe Middle East is a global hot spot for climate change and environmental stress on water, energy, agriculture, health and other necessities. Many cities in our region are predicted to become uninhabitable by the end of the century. In recognition of this pressing reality, the Arava Institute for Environmental Studies is conducting a variety of academic and research projects that combines regional environmental diplomatic activity, academic research, and the initiation and execution of projects throughout the Middle East.\n\nOne of our great projects is Methuselah. Methuselah is a date palm that Dr. Elaine Solowey sprouted from a 2,000-year-old date seed. This seed, among others, was found during the excavations of Masada in the mid 1960's. In 2005, several of these seeds were obtained by the Louis L. Borick Natural Medicine Research Center of the Hadassah Medical Organization, which gave them to Dr. Elaine Solowey at the Center for Sustainable Agriculture. Dr. Solowey successfully germinated one of these seeds, which sprouted into a young date palm.\n\nInitially thought to be botanically impossible, this successful project has been featured in the New York Times, National Geographic, and other publications. Today, Methuselah has a permanent home in the Arava Institute research park on Kibbutz Ketura.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/aravainstitute\/videos\/387142179880188\/\nwww.arava.org\nhttps:\/\/arava.org\/2022\/12\/post-cop27-with-tareq-abu-hamed\/\n\nWe'll be online from 12-1:30 p.m. PT (3-4:30 p.m. ET, 20-20:0 UT) to answer your questions!\n\nUsernames: \/u\/israelinsf","upvote_ratio":0.9,"created_utc":1674475257.0},{"title":"Can sedimentary rock for on land?","author":"24_Elsinore","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/askscience\/comments\/10kfowd\/can_sedimentary_rock_for_on_land\/","text":"Hi there. I am not a geologist, and most of my knowledge has come from seminars on soils or reading online sources. So I am here to ask a question of geologists that I am having trouble finding online.\n\nLithification of marine sediments appears to be the most common process in the creation of sedimentary rock. It's quite easy to find information on this. However, I have found very little information on whether there are terrestrial processes that create sedimentary rock on land. One could assume that the relative absence of information means it doesn't happen, but I don't want to assume that just because I can't easily find the information means it doesn't happen. So, are there any types of sedimentary rock that form in terrestrial environments, and what are the processes? I have read about cements and conglomerates, are those typically the only ones?\n\nGenerally it seems that lithification happens in marine environments, the rock is then uplifted into the terrestrial environment, where it then erodes back to the sea. Does lithification generally not happen on land because the accumulation of new sediment is not enough to replace or overtake sediment loss to erosion?\n\nI'd appreciate any pieces of information or sources on this.
