        "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen I was 16-17M I had a drinking problem. I would drink whenever I could get my hands on alcohol because it was the only way I knew how to escape. I would do all kind of stupid shit when I was drunk, try to fight people, verbally abuse people for no reason, throw up in peoples houses etc. i would often get angry at my parents for no reason and once I even had a fight with my dad. \n\n2 yrs ago aged 17 I met up with 3 girls and a male friend. I had had a lot to drink at this rate. I was sitting in a bench with one of the girls and I put my arm around her. She did not object to this so I thought I was on the next stage of flirting. I asked ro kiss her, she said no to that. A minute later I asked again and a minute after that I asked once more. All 3 times were rejected. Eventually i came to my senses and realise my attention was unwanted. I feel as though if I was physically stepping the line someone would have intervened. I cant actually remember any of this happening, this is just what I got told. I never forced myself on this person and I didn’t get aggressive or violent when rejected. After this happened she and all her friends left the venue and texted my friend that I fucked up and that no means no. I probably freaked her out bad. I didn’t understand what I was doing and I thought I was flirting but I got it horribly wrong and upset someone \n\nEveryone alienated me after this, all 4 people involved stopped talking to me. My friend was extremely angry with me and started calling me a harasser. \nDue to the response provided I have false memories of what happened. I only asked for a kiss but my mind keeps telling me that I groped/raped her because of how angry everyone was after the situation. I live in constant mental imprisonment. \nI know for a fact I had no bad intentions but in my drunken state I got it horribly wrong. \n\n\n\n When I heard about my actions the next morning I felt disgusted with myself, I instantly apologised to the girl I did it to. \nLooking back it was quite s lame apology, I said some shit like “I’m sorry if I made you feel uncomfortable last night I was really drunk” i didn’t know what to say\nShe told me she forgave me, my friend told me that she was initially upset after it had happened that I pushed her boundaries, but she accepted my apology. I don’t know if she just said this to make me feel better or what not but yeah. That was the last time i spoke to all the people involved. I feel disgusted within myself, I feel like a predator who kept pushing someone. I feel as though I might have traumatised her and ruined her life cos this was such a bad experience. It was after that I stopped drinking alcohol as a whole because I was now aware of its destructive nature. I haven’t done a thing of this nature since and realised that it was the alcohol dictating me. \n\nAfter I apologised I didn’t think too much of the incident, but 18 months later for some reason it’s come back into my mind and it’s all I think about 24/7. I really can’t understand why I did what I did. I certainly wouldn’t have done it sober, but I’ve realised that it’s no excuse. Their friend said to my friend it wasn’t that much of a big deal but I still can’t forget about it. \nI feel like a piece of shit for trying to do something without the other person’s consent. I was verbally asking for consent but I was being pushy about it. \nSince this has been of my mind, I haven’t allowed myself to have anormal life, I’ve since quit my job and I hardly leave my room. I feel as though this is who I’m gonna be forever. That drunk idiot that kept asking. I told one of my friends bout it and he said it wasn’t a big deal. I can’t even look my own mother in the eye knowing the way I treated a woman that night. No charges were ever pressed or anything, idk if I did something illegal or not but it was certainly immoral. \nI don’t know if asking for a kiss more than once is illegal (might fall under harassment) \nBut I feel I should’ve received some punishment for my actions \nI hate myself for it every day and I’ve been thinking about ending my life over this. Once u do something like this in todays society there is no going back. \n\n\nAlthough im 2 years sober and wont do something like this again I just cant let the past go. This haunts me 24/7 and honestly, I don’t think I’ll ever forgive myself for it. \nI thought of myself as an ally of women but this situation says that I wasn’t. \n\nI’m a pig. A disgusting man who ignored boundaries. I’m sorry to all women that have to deal w shit like this. I’ve heard some horror stories from some other girls and the stuff u have to put up with us disgusting. I wouldn’t consider myself a part of that domain but this encounter proves otherwise. \n\nI physically cry my eyes out when I see my mother. I’ve failed her, she told me to respect women growing up and I fucked it.",

        "text": "\nTW:Cyber stalking\n\nWhat I'm about to say is after a set of realizations I had about myself. These realizations have struck like lightning and drowned me today.I cannot believe I never realized this about myself. \n\nI have always been anxious, and afraid to face guys whom I've liked or had crushes on. I would not dream of wanting to ask them out, or being their friend, or being anywhere near them. I would admire them from afar, if they were ever in my vicinity. I never learnt to healthily cope with my feelings. \n\nThis resulted in some cyber stalking by me, if they ever had public profiles. Facebook, insta, google, YouTube ,LinkedIn maybe? I thought it was harmless, because I would never ever contact them, or talk to them about it, or get close to them , or anything. It was a way for me to learn something tiny, like their favourite show, or sport, or music, or YouTube channels.It made me build them up as a person in my head, instead of the normal way of actually talking to them and getting to know them.I never intended to pursue any of them romantically with that information.It was some sort of obsession, to know more about them. There was a period when I became internet addicted to YouTube and movies to avoid facing reality, and due to stress of college. I realize a lot of my behaviors stem out of fear and avoidance. \n\nToday, I checked a friend request to an ex-crush from college, to whom I'd sent one on NYE, after some realizations about myself being a coward. I wanted to be brave for once, though I didn't have feelings for this person anymore. A first step was just a plain friend request to conquer my fear. He never accepted it. I thought, did he see me frequenting his profile before, and finds me disgusting? I unsent the request. \n\nAnother stranger on reddit online ,whom I'd messaged to give some well intentioned unsolicited advice(1-2 messages) about her breakup, blocked me, and I reached out to her from an alt account to genuinely apologize and promised that it would be my last message and leave her alone.She blocked me there too. Without saying anything. I realized I should have respected her space when she was heartbroken and not wanting to engage. \n\nAll the people I've had feelings for, I've tried to stalk online for public profiles and find something small, so it makes them more of a person with substance in my head, instead of actually talking to them.I never tried to hack anyone, or never tried to physically stalk anyone. I never contacted any of my crushes with any of this information. I was never intending to bother or talk to any of them. But how could they trust me? Why would they trust me? It doesn't take much for a person to lose touch with reality often. They have no reason to believe my intentions are not bad. BTW, I don't think any of them know I did slightly stalk them online. I'm not sure. \n\nOffline, everyone thinks I'm a nice person. \n\nI don't know how, but tonight, the dam burst and the flood gates opened. It finally began to click together. I feel horrible about myself. I feel like a pariah. I never ever intended to make anyone feel unsafe, or harass anyone, or make them uncomfortable, but I realize my behaviors have been unhealthy not only to myself, but also, to others if they were to know. Imagine someone knowing my details without knowing me personally . I would personally be uncomfortable too. I want to stop this. I feel very heavy. \n\nI know that not everyone whom I liked can know this about me, some will never know. Hell, I'm not sure any knew I liked them. Let them not know and be peaceful in oblivion. I won't bother them or be a part of their life ever. I will stop engaging in these unhealthy coping mechanisms. \n\nSome who know me on reddit here,if you ever see this,I'm sorry. I really am.  You can block and choose to stay away from me forever. It will hurt, but I deserve to deal with it. Do not worry, I don't know anything about you since we were always anonymous on reddit and I'm genuinely not a cyberhacker or anything of that sort. \n\nI have tried to provide justification for why I did what I did and thought, but nothing justifies making people uncomfortable,even if they don't know it. \n\nI was always under the impression that I was a good person, atleast in my intentions. I thought that was the one redeeming quality I had. But that only goes so far- if my actions affect others or aren't healthy, how am I a good person? Intentions alone aren't enough. My rosy mirage about myself has disappeared. My self image feels a darker grey. I feel rotten from within and flawed. I don't feel I deserve love unless I actively work on this and avoid engaging in similar behaviors.I will do my best.",

Everything I've ever done is for MY own benefit.\n\nI have no problem cutting others off, manipulating them to buy me things all without feeling the slightest bit of remorse.

I have threw a 3 y/o at a wall because he tried to bit me and played it off as he had tripped on one of his toys.\n\nI wouldn't care at all if people around me died unless I was in their will.

        "text": "For context, my job has a partnership with the online university I go to and my tuition is fully covered. I’m in a pathway to admissions program; meaning I’m admitted but not *fully* admitted yet. I’m trying to earn the grades to reach the GPA I would’ve needed to be immediately in. This pathway technically counts as my freshman year. \n\nSo far, I’ve been doing just okay. Not great grades. C’s and a couple B’s. This semester though, I’ve been doing horribly. I let myself fall a few weeks behind in one course, and didn’t even start the other. I’m 5 weeks into an 8 week semester with F’s in both of my classes. With having my tuition covered, I can drop the course at any time and retake it without any negative effect to me. I just feel horrible that I let myself get that bad and irresponsible with my work. I used to have such a tough time in high school and I thought taking a gap year and going to college on my own terms, I’d be able to do it. And I did for a bit, but I let myself down. I dropped the courses and my parents and partner don’t even know. I don’t want to tell them because they’ve been rooting for me this whole time. Not only did I let myself down, but if they know I’d let them down too.\n\nThank you for listening, I just needed to get this out in the open so it doesn’t weigh too much more on me.",

        "text": "I (43f) have 4 kids. My middle child (15f) and I have had a rough relationship these past years. She’s a freshman in high school, I understand that high school can be difficult but I feel as if she’s taking it too far. In 7th grade she was bullied but I didn’t believe her until one day she came home sobbing, I thought she was just being dramatic because she has a tendency of over exaggerating things. That same year she told me and her stepfather that she didn’t want to live, claiming that she’s depressed and we don’t do anything to help. But anyways enough with the backstory. She seemed fine at the beginning of her freshman year, she went out every weekend, always smiling, and always laughing on the phone with her friends. Apparently mid November of this past year she had a falling out with her best friend and since then she hasn’t been as cheerful. She hasn’t been cleaning her room or doing her chores, her grades are slipping, her relationship with her biological father is suffering, and she’s a lot more irritable and snappy at others in the house. If she doesn’t do something right I strictly explain to her what she did wrong, and i tell her how and why to fix it. After I do this she looks defeated like someone just killed our dog. All she does say in and day out is sit in her room, locked away in darkness. She only leaves to use the bathroom or eat. Even then she barley leaves to eat, she leaves her room maybe 2 times a day. Today I told her that she needed to do things today or else she wouldn’t be able to leave the house tomorrow. Her stepfather then included that she is way behind on doing things. She got the same defeated look on her face that she normally gets when she’s told she did something incorrectly. I looked in her room 20 minutes ago and it is still not clean. I lost my temper and yelled at her. I then sent her articles that show that messy rooms lead to bad attitudes. Her stepfather and i have always been very strict on chores, devices, times and places etc. and with these rules I feel as if we’re reaching our kids how to be responsible. But I realize that my daughter is a lost cause. If she wants to live in filth and continue to disappoint me with everything she does that’s fine. I don’t care anymore. There’s 3 more years until she goes to college and then she won’t be my problem anymore.",

        "text": "When I (24f) was in high school, I had a drug problem. I was a major partier, constantly skipping school, out seven nights a week waking up in random places every morning—golf courses, country clubs, apartment building lounges, and all sorts of houses in different counties far from home. But I loved having a huge group of friends and feeling like I fit in somewhere. I loved being known. I loved the adrenaline of not knowing where my days or nights would head. I got heavily into prescription pills and some other stuff pretty early on, and was constantly in a zombie-like, happy state. I’d go anywhere with anyone, putting myself in some pretty dangerous situations. I’ve had some pretty traumatic and violent things happen to me during these years, but that’s a whole different story. \n\nI was 16 when me and all of my friends started getting in pretty big trouble. Having crazy grand ideas, and often getting away with it—stealing hundreds of dollars from malls, robbing friends during drug deals, destroying property for the hell of it. But there’s one memory that still shakes me.\n\nMy friend had another friend who went on vacation often. My friend, being close to this girl years ago, let us all know that she would be gone for the week in a different country with her family, and my friend knew her garage code. We all decided that we would go late at night to this girl’s house, and take whatever we could get our hands on. I was the “getaway driver.” We suited up in all black, gloves, etc., and hit the house hard. My friends stole expensive jewelry (watches, diamond necklaces and earrings, sentimental rings), dozens of clothing items, and even their living room tv. I had parked on the side of the house, car on and headlights off. After about five-ten minutes, they came dashing out with more than I expected, and I helped everyone stuff everything into the trunk and backseat (it was a car with three rows of seats). \n\nI remember seeing news of the burglary on tv about a week later when the family returned. We had apparently stolen thousands, and thousands, and thousands worth. But the worst part of all was seeing the family crying in an interview, talking about how much crippling debt that they had already been in prior to the burglary, and are so devastated due to these new losses and also the loss of numerous sentimental items. Of course, none of us said a word, and all got away with it. Years later, I got sent to a rigorous military school and sobered up. I became a new person with an entirely new group of friends, making the Dean’s list, becoming captain of our varsity cheer team, and even leader of our a capella group. I’m a different person now, and would like to think that I put others first and treat people with kindness and respect these days. But I still have nightmares about that poor family crying into the camera. None of my friends were ever caught in the case, so I would never turn myself in now, especially with this happening close to ten years ago—I am also a respected kindergarten teacher. I pray for that family every night, and wish I could go back in time. My past haunts the hell out of me.",

        "text": "So, about 6 months ago I went on a week-long trip with my school while my little sister sister stayed home with my mum.\n\nMy sister stayed with my grandma while my mum picked me up at 2am and my grandma dropped my sister back home at 7am. I woke up at 9am and went downstairs.\n\nI mentioned that I thought my sister would have woke me up as she had when I returned from previous trips.\n\nMy mum: Oh, well, she was going to, but I told her you needed rest so she just stared at you sleeping for 15 minutes.\n\n\nAs you can imagine, i was a little but shocked. Anyway, a friend messaged me through a group chat to ask abt my trip where I casually mentioned what my sister had done. One of my friends jokingly called her the “sleep paralysis demon” and the name just kinda stuck.\n\nWhenever we discuss my sister, we never use her name, we only call her the sleep paralysis demon.\n\n“Oh, what are you getting the sleep paralysis demon for her birthday?”\n\n“Let’s see that picture - is that the sleep paralysis demon?”\n\nIt’s a long joke between us but I cant help feeling guilty about calling her that.",
