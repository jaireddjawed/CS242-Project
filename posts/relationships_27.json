        "text": "We met in summer 2019. We quickly “fell in love”- it was the first time in my (32m) life I had felt “head over heels” and she (34f) felt the same. She’s the most naturally beautiful woman I’ve ever seen, no exaggeration. We met each other’s families and things were getting serious—saying “I love you” and making plans for our shared future—right until she broke up with me out of the blue and without thorough explanation in April of 2020, about 8-9 months later. I was devastated and confused. I fought for the relationship for months but was rebuffed. \n\nIn July 2021 we run into each other after a year of no contact. She was in a relationship and I was single at the time. We went for dinner despite her relationship status. At this rendezvous of ours, she tells me I’m “as handsome as ever”, and we continued seeing each other (semi) platonically for a couple of months. I know this wrong and I knew it then— she had a boyfriend and we shouldn’t have been seeing each other. She frequently complained about her boyfriend to me (he was critical of her, flakey, much older than us). I told her early on in our reconnecting that I still had strong feelings for her and didn’t want to hear about her boyfriend anymore; she told me that “was music to her ears, but that I might have to play the ‘long game’” because she wasn’t single.\n\nWell, she broke up with her then boyfriend not long after in October 2021, and we began sleeping together a few weeks later. Right before we slept together the first time, she told me she “does love me, but is scared.” After sleeping together, she would pull away frequently (say things like “we shouldn’t have done that”) and she made a relationship impossible. I persisted. \n\nI got routinely hurt—really badly—by her cruel hot/cold treatment of me. As an example, she had friends over one night and invited me. When I arrived she ignored me the whole time. Whenever I tried to contribute to the conversation, she would disagree with me in front of everyone. I also caught her in a lie—we had made plans one night. She texted me to cancel bc she wasn’t feeling well. Before I could respond, she texted me again, saying “can’t wait to see you tonight” which was obviously meant for someone else. She apologized and said she double booked herself, but “really wasn’t feeling well.” I then went “no contact” in Feb 2022. \n\nI missed her terribly, and reached out in April, just a couple months later. She was happy to hear from me, and by May we were now in a committed relationship. Seemingly picking up where we had left off in our last relationship. She said she realized over the last couple of months how much she missed me and how important I was to her. \n\nBy June, we were saying “I love you,” going on weekend trips, and making plans to move in together. Happiest time of my life, until she abruptly ended things after a weekend away with her parents in October. She was distant on the trip, more critical of me than normal (I couldn’t do anything right; making the bed, cooking, she told me I was “annoying” and “cringey” in a certain social situation on that trip. When we got back she told me she loved me less than she did before we left, and thought she wanted to date other people. \n\nI was devastated, again. Despite the breakup, we continued to see each other for dinner—usually at my apartment. I continued with my Herculean efforts—cooking elaborate meals for us, having her favorite wine ready, etc., but no sex and her demeanor towards me was frequently cold. In the beginning of our relationship (both times), I experienced “love bombing” —she would say things like “I hope our kids have your face,” “I can’t wait to move in with you,””I love you,” “I’m crazy about you” and “you’re so important to me.” This love bombing quickly shifted to devaluation (frequent criticism over small things despite my endless efforts to please her, belittling, prioritizing others over me, withholding affection, etc). It went from 0 to 100 and back to 0 again, in a matter of months. I was an objectively good boyfriend. I loved her endlessly and passionately, and she was my main priority. \n\nI reached out to her over Christmas, only to be told she’s now in a “serious” relationship and doesn’t “feel right about seeing each other one-on-one.” I told her I still love her, she simply said that was “problematic” and she said she wanted me to leave her alone. The wound gets deeper and deeper. \n\nI see their all her family now follow him on social media, which is more than I ever got. He has eclipsed me and I can’t get over it. I feel worthless and the anxiety of them being together and me unable to do anything about it is horrible, unbearable. \n\nI’m sorry for the long post, and if anyone has any ideas or insights as to her behavior, please share because I’m at a loss and can’t get over it. Thanks for reading. \n\nTL/DR: my ex (34f) and I dated for 8 months in ‘19-20, and she ended things very suddenly right when our relationship was getting serious. I went NC, but we reconnected over a year later. She was seeing someone else at this point. She broke up with him not long after and we got back together. She kept me at arms length though and dumped me again. We got back together in the Spring of last year, yet again. She claimed to realize how much she missed me. We were going on weekend trips with her parents, saying “I love you” and planning to move in together; even talk of our future children. Well, she dumped me out of the blue— yet again—after 4 months. She’s now in a “serious relationship” and I’m spiraling into a depression. I can’t move on or stop thinking about her.",

        "text": "I see potential in him, but that's just it- potential. We had a great friendship prior to dating. We would talk for at least 2 or 3 hours every night. It was easy, we lived in the same house (sharing with 5 others). I think he does love me,as much as someone with his issues can. But it isn't enough. It isn't the love I want. I dated a terrible, manipulative guy who took me for granted for 2.5 years. That was 2 years ago and now I'm 5 months into something somewhat like that. It's scary. \n\nI don't want a project, I want a BF. He's too cold and he flip flops on me a lot. Jekyll and Hyde type. I anger him so easily and he'll always deny it but I see it. He starts fights over nothing and will \"forgive\" me but then decide he's still angry about it a day or 2 later and suddenly he's cold again. I'm scared of setting him off, but honestly, I'm starting to not care and it upsets him. On a few occasions I've asked why doesn't he just break up with me if he's that unhappy.  He doesn't like that. We had a nice evening together and he was sweet to me this morning and now I have false hope again. How do I get out of this when I still love him?\n\nTLDR: I need to leave my BF but I keep chickening out. How do I push through and end it?",

When we book things like that where we're splitting the cost, one of us books it and the other person transfers them their half.\n\nI had booked the cinema tickets, booked bowling, paid a deposit for the restaurant and paid a deposit for the cocktail bar. The night before my gf said she has a bit of a headache so I asked if she wanted to cancel anything that we have planned because at that point I'd be able to get a refund for all but the cinema tickets. She said no and that she'd be fine to go. The next morning she said she felt a lot better but didn't want to risk going to anything incase it made her worse. I understood this but pointed out we'd now lose the money for everything. I said I'd go to the cinema on my own since we had the ticket but for bowling, the restaurant and the cocktail bar we'd lose the money. She was slightly annoyed that I was going to the cinema on my own and thought I'd wait for her.\n\nI asked if she wouldn't mind sending me the money for everything that we've cancelled so the money for her cinema ticket, bowling, the restaurant and the cocktail bar. She wasn't happy and said since we're not doing it she shouldn't have to pay. I pointed out it's because of her we're not doing it and I shouldn't have to lose money because she cancelled plans.\n\nShe said I was more bothered about the money than how she was feeling and that I was being unfair. I mentioned that I had asked her the night before if she wanted me to cancel and at that point we'd have got a full refund but she said no. She just responded that she thought she'd be going at that point and didn't want to cancel. Does anyone have any advice?\n\ntldr; My gf and I had a lot of plans booked for yesterday that she cancelled but is unhappy that I am doing one of the plan myself and that I asked her for the money I lost because of the cancelled plans. Does anyone have any advice?\n\nedit: I posted this yesterday but it got removed for being too unclear so I've edited it here to clear things up. In terms of paying deposits, I'm in the UK and most of the restaurants in the town I live in ask for a deposit for a reservation due to people booking and just not showing up. With bowling, you have to book and pay in advance for the lane as the place is bookings only",

We are both busy ( he has kids and works every day) and haven't seen each other for 2 months! When one of us was free to meet the other one isn't.  However,I will be honest,I'm the one who initiated more about meeting up.I pointed out the lack of effort to him and asked if he doesn't want to see me anymore. He was very defensive and said that he does but he is busy and a bit depressed. Then he suggested that we book a holiday together and we did. He texted me everyday and we made plans to meet up when we are free.Few days ago he posted a story of himself making cocktails and candlelights on the table. I asked what it was and he said that I'm judging him and changed the subject. I decided not to mention it but later that evening, after having a few drinks,  I started questioning him again and he seemed irritated.I even called him at midnight and he basically told me to piss off and drop the call 😅 so I blocked him in response. Oh and he told me that he hasn't got time for a serious relationship and drama and also that he agreed to the holiday because he liked me blabla ( he was the one who suggested it). I really liked him and I'm so disappointed by what happened and also how I behaved. Also, if I cancel the holiday now there will be very high fees. Should I contact him to ask him what he wants to do about the holiday?\n\nTL;DR\nI blocked him after he posted suspicious picture and when I questioned him he said that he doesn't want drama and also hasn't got time for a serious relationship. He said that he wants to focus on himself and his kids. He got angry because I accused him of stringing me along. We have a holiday booked together so should I unblock him to talk about that?",

Julia's bf (20M) and my bf was their bestfriends since they were children. (im gonna call him Carl, also a fake name) so i thought we'd be a great family since everyone is so close to each other. \n\ni was wrong. Julia changed a lot. she was never the sweettiest girl like she used to be. she was so helpful, kind, innocent that i was always ready to beat some ass to protect her. she was the fragile one. but years ruined her. she became a disgusting rude person, she is an arrogant and a manipulating girl i can never imagine now. then i realized she was manipulating to keep my bf beside her. she was using him to protect herself from the others. \n\nmy bf had a crush on her when he first saw her but his bestfriend Carl wanted to make a move so my bf step back, let him have Julia. Julia knew what was exactly going on and she used him. she even made him tell \"julia, if i get a girl and she would be jealous of you, i'd leave her right in that moment\" she made a perfect place to his heart and his life. and she never wanted to be close to me like we used to be. in fact, she is trying to ignore me and exclude me from the conversations. \n\ni get a bad vibe from her. and this is the part that really hurts me. \n\nmy boyfriend is under her impression. even though he says that i am the love of his life. he acts like that person is Julia, not me. he compares us all the time and telling me she is better than me in almost every way. he once told me \"she is braver and funnier than you\" when we were on the vacation just because i didnt jump off a stupid bridge with him. he laughs with her more, he has fun with her more. he always finds her right no matter what. for example, when she does a bad thing that my bf would never approve and make them regret the second they tell him they did this thing, he wouldnt care and always says \"if Julia did this, she has her own reasons\" \n\nalso they are extremly touchy to each other. she always touching him somehow, always has a reason. like scratching his big-bodybuilder-muscular back or massaging it, or she plays with his hair. and he loves taking her into his arms to hug, wrestle or just jump on her in the middle of the sea as a joke. she always calls him 'babe, love, honey, sweetheart' etc. they hang out mostly in the late hours. my bf usually call her \"man, bro, buddy etc.\" but she never does\n\nshe once saw a wet dream about him and told it to my bf, i still dont understand what is the purpose of this??\n\ni talked to him about it. i told him that he has feelings for her and she is using him for it but he denied as expected. so i told him even though those are all normal things to them, i feel uncomfortable. then he said he will be more careful and he can even cut her off. but i know he didn't mean it, he would hate me the rest of his life. so i told him to be more careful. then he did for 2 days or smt. but he was always angry and treated me bad. he was never happy. just bc he was being CAREFUL. even didnt want him to cut her off \n\nso i talked to him again and told him it was my mistake, he can act like whatever he wants and all i did was overthinking. \n\nand you know what? it made him so happy in the moment, he eventually started to smile again. \n\nwe were good for a few weeks. then i exploded. i sweared and yelled and we had our worst fight. he told all of these to Julia, he trusted her since she is the best emotional supporter friend and he asked her help like \"what should i do to fix this?\" \n\nthen Julia went to his bf Carl, told her everything my bf said aaaand i am too toxic and even sick so i shouldn't be talking to any of them. Carl yelled at me \"you are talking about my best friend of years and my girlfriend, are you insane?\" \n\nhe felt inconfident when he saw things as i did and he understood what Julia was doing. \n\nMy bf protected me all along, he stood beside me. And disgusted by Julia, he is no longer trust her. But he doesnt wanna lose Carl. I too want their friendship last. \n\nSince Carl's not gonna break up with Julia, i dont know what should we do?\n\nTLDR; i was feeling uncomfortable about this girl and i told my bf about it, everything ruined when he told it to his girl bestfriend, now i dont know how to fix my bf and his male bestfriends relationship",

        "text": "We have been 3 years together, we first started out as friends, then things progressed smoothly and fast forward 3 years, we’re about to get engaged. \nShe resides in a different country, and during these past 3 years I’ve been relocating my occupation, I even bought us 2 apartments there. \n\nThings were going fine until all of a sudden 3 months ago we quarreled and she decided she wants some space for herself. I told her it was fine by me. 25 days go by without a word from her, so I messaged her, then she tells me that we’re through and that she can’t do this anymore. \n\nShe says she’s been unhappy these last few months and that she feels that her needs aren’t being met. I told her I will do my best, but I can’t read your mind, you have to voice out your needs and desires. I tried with her multiple times, but she kept saying that it’s over. Mind you I didn’t notice any change in her behavior these last few months, she was happy, she would send me I love you multiple times throughout the day, and keeps telling me that she misses me and that I need to hurry up and come to her so we can get engaged ASAP. She was super excited. \n\nI’m devastated, I feel betrayed.\n\nEntering into a relationship has more downsides than upsides. Relationships can be challenging to establish, even more challenging to sustain, and can result in significant emotional harm when they conclude. The reality that both parties must consent to initiate a relationship, while just one can terminate it, illustrates how relationships are a significant gamble, risking one's time, emotions, and often finances.\n\nRelationships are nothing but a trap. They are a waste of time, emotions, and money. The chances of finding someone who truly cares for you and whom you can trust are slim to none. Even if you do find someone, the likelihood of the relationship lasting is so low that it's not worth the effort. Relationships are a constant struggle, and when they inevitably fail, the pain and suffering are unbearable. The comfort and warmth that relationships provide are nothing but a temporary illusion that fades away quickly, leaving you with nothing but despair and heartbreak. The only thing worse than being in a relationship is the lingering pain that comes after it's over. The saying \"better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all\" is just a delusional lie that people tell themselves to feel better about their miserable lives. In the end, relationships are a pointless and futile endeavor that only lead to disappointment and misery.\n\nAdjusting our expectations for relationships may seem like a good idea, but in reality, it's just another way of admitting defeat before we even begin. No matter how much we try to minimise risk, relationships are still doomed to fail. It's not a matter of if, but when. And when they do fail, the emotional turmoil can be unbearable.\n\nWhile we can try to learn and grow from the experience, the fact remains that we're still left with the pain and emptiness that comes with the end of a relationship. And what's the point of learning and growing if it's just going to lead to more pain in the end?\n\nA successful relationship, in my opinion, is one where both partners are in harmony, and there is mutual growth and understanding. It's a beautiful thing to witness when two people are able to come together and create something greater than themselves.\n\nHowever, it's important to acknowledge that these kinds of relationships are extremely rare. For every successful relationship, there are countless others that end in heartache and disappointment. The risk of going through the pain of a breakup is not worth the chance of finding that rare gem of a relationship.\n\nThe emotional turmoil that comes with the end of a relationship can be overwhelming, and it's not something that should be taken lightly. It's easy to get caught up in the moment and believe that the joy and happiness that come with a relationship are worth the risk, but in reality, the pain and heartache that follow a breakup are often much more intense and long-lasting.\n\nTL;DR: my gf broke up with me all of a sudden before our long planned engagement.",

Anyway. We have rough/kinky sex sometimes but he knows my limits and we have a safe word – he knows I am absolutely not comfortable with anal sex. \n\nThe other night we were hanging out together and I’d had a bit to drink. He’s really into c0ke and sometimes I do it with him. I did a line but then I declined anymore he offered me because I get the worst comedown from c0ke and I was already feeling pretty wrecked. He kind of pushed me down onto the bed (fairly normal for us, he will sometimes just go for it with sex) and pulled down my underwear. I thought he was going to start foreplay but instead he shoved a massive amount of c0caine into me anally (sorry I don’t know how else to phrase that). As he was doing it he held me down while shoving me face down into the pillow so they couldn’t hear me scream next door. I was freaking out as he did it because as I said I really hate anal to the point where I felt like I was going to be sick, and he was kind of laughing at me and being like you’re going to be absolutely fucked by the amount I’ve given you, wait until it hits you, that sort of stuff. I’m a massive hypochondriac but I was worried I was going to overdose or something. \n\nI don’t know how I feel about it – I’m struggling to see it as ass@ault because it wasn’t sexual in nature. He was just trying to get me wasted and like be in control, I think he gets off on my fear. I also didn’t say our safe word, mainly because it just didn’t feel like that scenario in the moment and I was taken by surprise. And we didn’t have proper sex that night, we did other stuff but I think he realised I wasn’t quite up to sex. But I stil feel really…humiliated. It’s not funny right, I’m not being sensitive? He also grabbed me around the neck that night because I rolled my eyes at something he said and was like “DON’T roll your eyes at me. Got it?” And kept squeezing harder until I nodded and he’d made me apologise. I’m okay with being submissive during sex but I’m worried it’s bleeding out into our other interactions now, which I’m not okay with. I normally like the sex and he’s fun to hang out with but I’m wondering if he’s going to continue to push boundaries under the guise of “kink” or if I should communicate and give him another chance. Thoughts?\n\nTL;DR my sexual partner took it too far and I don’t know whether it’s something we can hash out by talking or if I should stop seeing him.",

        "text": "Tldr; wife had a affair and doesn't know if she wants to continue our marriage after building years of resentment.\n\nI've posted in relationship_advice and got threatened and frowned upon for not wanting divorce. This sub seems to be a bit more friendly.\n\nWe've been together for 10 years, married for almost 5. We have a 2yo and 4yo who are my life.\n\nRecently our marriage turned sour and we're currently separated after my wife had a short but intense affair and we both need time and space to decide what's best for our future.\n\nAfter a month long full separation while co parenting from our own house we decided it was best for our kids that our family would be as normal as possible until we made a definite decision.\n\nLong story short, we've have been happy together until about 2 years ago when my wife was pregnant with our youngest. I was still recovering from a burn out and her mom passed away from cancer all in a couple months time. We both weren't emotionally available for eachother.\n\nOn top of that the birth of our youngest was very traumatic for me and in hindsight that was the nail in the coffin.\n\nWe went in survival mode. We talked but never truly communicated. \n\nOur sex life always has been great and in a advantageous mood we decided to try a MFM threesome. We both loved it. Tried it again with a different partner. He fell in love with my wife short after. She was fed up with me after a argument and a affair was the result. \n\nI knew straight away and as soon as I asked she admitted it and told me she had a hard time to break it of because she finally felt happy and Loved after a long time. We decided to give eachother space. There where no secrets, just details missing. The affair ended when he ghosted her end of January \n\nMy wife told me she has been unhappy for years. She didn't feel loved, seen and admired by me. Things I did in the beginning of our relationship still bothered her.\n\nCurrently we are spend a lot of time together. After we decided to continue our family life for the kids (2 weeks ago) we talk a lot when they are asleep. We went to a concert together. I rub her neck and feet. We work out together like we used to before kids.\nWe laugh a lot. We just don't have sex.\n\nWhen I bring up our status she insists we are separated and if she would make a decision right now it would be devorce because she's fed up putting in all the work. There seems to be no room for the things I did for the family and for her.\n\nLast Friday I had my first emdr therapy session for the traumatic event surrounding the birth of our youngest and as expected it's been a emotional rollercoaster of unprocessed emotions that now run free.\n\nOne thing I feel now is a very, very intense love for my kids and a even more intense love for my wife. I now realize Ive felt numb the past couple years.\n\nI told her and she said \"well you're too late now\" and turned me the cold shoulder. She explained she still needs more time and space because she needs to process all the resentment she feels before she even knows what she truly feels for me other than frustration.\n\nIt's hard to continue the effort I put in without feeling the love Ive felt in return until November last year. I don't know how much longer I can continue.",

        "text": "My partner and I have been together for somewhat over 2 years. We have been living long distance, so we only see each other every 2 weeks (that is the routine usually, we meet on the weekend then). Sometimes less (once every 3-4 weekends)…He‘s trying to make art in his studio, he comes from a wealthy family so all he can do is focus on making art with all the tools and machines he could buy. The thing is though, that in somewhat over 2 years, he has not proceeded towards working on art. He always finds a new project to start, which has nothing to do with his actual goal. I‘m afraid that he‘s just avoiding working on making art because he‘s been alone since he graduated from art school and is anxious to get back into that world. \n\nSo the only time where we can see each other (since I am working in my family’s business and studying) is when I can take some days off, but he said we can’t meet up during the week or it will fck with his schedule. I agreed even though I am sad we only see each other every few weekends then. Now I have a month off of work, and he knew that I was planning to stay with him at least during a week, at HIS place. I said if it doesn’t work I will leave, I thought it would be nice to falls sleep in the evening and during the day we both try to work (he in his studio and me on some assignments for uni). He just doesn’t want me to come and said it won’t work, that it will just be too distracting and put him out of schedule. \n\nNow I can’t help but feel upset about it, in one year this is the only time where we can spend some time together, where I!!! have time to visit him so we both can be productive, since he complained about how he cannot be productive when he visits me. It frustrates me that he claims to know even though he can’t know and we haven’t tried being productive together. Besides that, if he was actually making art I would get it, but for 2 years he has been working on new projects all the time, that don’t directly contribute to his goal of making great art. I feel like he punishes our relationship for him not being where he wants to be. And I have to accept it. He becomes frustrated of his own behaviour too, but he would never admit that he‘s avoiding it. I know he takes his goal seriously, as in that is the most important thing in his life, and I respect that, but I have goals too which he doesn’t seem to be taking seriously. He basically tells me I‘m not determined enough if I have time to be so invested in a relationship. I went against a lot of my boundaries to respect his space and his goals and behaviour. I‘m afraid I‘m wasting my time for him to one day say „there is no space for you anymore“ or I get blamed for him being too distracted. Do you guys think I am wasting my time?\n\n\n\nTL;DR! My partner complains about not being able to be productive when visiting me, but doesn’t allow me to visit him so we both can be productive. Am I wasting my time in this relationship?",

        "text": "Hi everyone! As the title suggests, I have been seeing this girl for a little over 6months now, and she makes me the happiest I have ever been. However, recently I have been having some uncomfortable feelings towards her when she is not around that I want to sort out. For context, we go to the same college, but actually live about 3 hours away from each other. We met at the beginning of the school year, and everything was going perfectly (and it still is, that’s the problem I’ll get to in a minute); until winter break. During winter break, I had to go back home, and I missed her a lot and felt kinda lonely again. She visited me once, but our breaks are long (about 6-weeks), so there was about 5 weeks there without her. Because of this break, I think I developed a co-dependency thing, because once we got back on campus I got weird feelings when she wasn’t around. I don’t know how to describe them, but it’s like jealousy (at the idea that she may be hanging out with other dudes or something even though there’s zero signs of cheating or anything, it’s college, people hangout with people, but I still get nasty what-if thoughts), mixed with anxiety about her general well being, mixed with loneliness. I have gotten better as the year has gone on and I have gotten my usual midterm work load to keep me occupied, but recently these feelings came back stronger and it’s scary to me. Spring break started yesterday, and I have decided to stay on campus for the break because I started work as a security guard for campus recently, but my gf (were both 18, I’m M she’s F), went on a business field trip with one of her business classes a few hours away. Alright whatever, some alone time for both of us to chill and relax before finals season, right? Well that’s what I was hoping for, but when I called her tonight, she didn’t engage with me much because she was working on her resume. (Again, normal, she gets focused when she’s busy), but then she said that she was inviting one of her guy friends from the class over to help her with her LinkedIn. That’s when I started to get \nThese pangs again. All of the thoughts started coming back and those same nasty feelings came back. I asked her if she wanted me to call her back and she said sure. I called her back an hour later closer to midnight and her and the guy were working on stuff in her hotel room. He was on the other side of the room, but it is a single hotel room, so the jealous/anxious pangs just got like boosted to 100%. I got kinda sad and just said I was going to bed I love you and all of that stuff and hung up. I’m sitting here typing this sorta as a journal type thing so I can calm down and sleep, but also because I really need help understanding these emotions. She has never once given me any reason to believe she would cheat. I have met her entire family, I know some of her exes even (none of whom she cheated on, one actually cheated on her unfortunately) and none of them have ever had anything negative to say about her, nor that she did anything suspicious like that, and that’s the problem I’m having. Nothing she’s doing IS suspicious or a red flag! She’s just working on a project with a MALE friend in her  HOTEL room at MIDNIGHT, but for some reason my brain deletes everything else and I can only focus on MALE, HOTEL, MY GF, MIDNIGHT. I’m unsure how to cope with these feelings because I know it’s almost 100% my fault for perpetuating my own anxiety, as I have had anxiety problems in the past. I would just like some advice. Even just telling me that I’m over-reacting about the whole thing and the hotel thing isn’t a red flag would be nice, I just don’t want to feel these alone with no advice. Thanks in advance for reading my rant by the way!\n\nTl;dr: gf had class friend come over to her hotel room later at night to work on a project, and I don’t know how to stop overthinking about it.",

She wasn’t allowed friends, mostly grounded and forced to stay in her room, if she acted out the stepdad would physically hurt her, nasty stuff. He has also hit her mum several times (black eyes).\n\nAt 14 my fiancé gave her mum the ultimatum of either it’s me or him, her mum opted for the step dad.\n\nAfter many years, they eventually start talking and my fiancé has visited them a couple of times. Over these years, I was subjected to abusive messages from them, really nasty stuff.\n\nI’m having difficulties with the situation now as we have a toddler, my fiancé takes her with her when visiting, I’m not 100% comfortable with this, they’re a mentally and physically abusive family.\n\nYesterday, my fiancé comes home and tells me that she’s planned a night out with just them, the day before her birthday, where she’s celebrating another night out with me and her friends.\n\nI don’t think there are any excuses for the words I used, but I told her that I feel like I’ve lost some respect for her, and that it’s quite disrespectful towards me. She’s a grown adult and can make her own choices, but I feel this one is very naive. It exposes me and our daughter, and herself to this situation blowing up in our face, with the addition of alcohol, I can’t even imagine the fallout.\n\nThey have never confronted or made amends since she left at 14, it feels like it’s all been pushed under the rug, I’m scared it’s going to burst.\n\nTLDR: fiancé has reconnected with abusive mother and stepdad and it’s making me uncomfortable.",

        "text": "I just got recently diagnosed with ADHD-PI (primarily inattentive) and for the most of my life I‘ve been a mess and always went in for stupid decisions and really can‘t focus at school and work and have trouble with keeping up with my friendships, finances, homework, work ethic etc. I‘m just really a mess, sure I shouldn‘t take ADHD as an excuse but it‘s the reality. However I have a loving, stable relationship with my Boyfriend for now almost 2 years (dated for 1 year) and he is also neurodivergent as I am since he has Aspergers on the spectrum. The thing is he is one who thinks mental illness isn‘t really an obstacle in life and people should actually work against their mental illness instead just cry about it (which is true to some extent but also isn‘t) so the time I brought that I may could have adhd he reacted so bad and was mad at me for going for such a dumb thing and I should just work more on myself than being the reason why the doctors earn more money. \n\nSooo a bit forward and I got actually diagnosed with ADHD and the psychiatrist told me we can either start treatment with meds or I can go to ergotherapy. I told her no I don‘t want to take meds but I could try with ergotherapy. Dumbest. Thing. I‘ve. Ever. Said.\nI feel like I mostly said no because my Boyfriend didn‘t want me to as he got also offered as a kid Ritalin and other medical drugs but his family was completely against it as they didnt want him to drug him up with some nonsense. I know very well ADHD medication isn‘t nonsense at all and I‘ve read all the time that many adhders have a lot of success under medicinal treatment. So 3 weeks forwards after the diagnosis I wish I said yes as I‘m now especially struggling a lot in at work and school and on the verge of getting fired and me burning out. \n\nI will definitely give the psychiatrist a call so we can discuss me going on medicinal treatment but I don‘t know how to tell that my boyfriend, he‘d be furious and perhaps breaking up with me but honestly if I get better with adhd medicine I won‘t regret it.\nI also thought about taking ritalin to see how it affects me but without telling my boyfriend. I don‘t know if I also just keep it from him as a secret because I really wanna take meds but I also don‘t want to make my bf mad.\nfyi : i‘m from germany so excuse my grammar mistakes also I work in a dual-system called „Ausbildung“ and it‘s a vocational training where I go to school twice a week and to work 4 times. I work in full-time.\n\nTL;dr : Recently diagnosed with adhd, in relationship with an aspergers man and got offered by psychiarist adhd meds but as my boyfriend don’t want me to i said no to that offer and now regret that desicion and now im thinking about starting medicinal treatment perhaps without him knowing but I don‘t want to lie to him or make him furious",

Then, if there is chemistry you sleep with him or go on dates first and then sleep.\n\nBut here is the \"surprise\": you didn't expect him to be so fat and his skin is ruined by stretch marks.\n\nDid you ever experienced something like this? How did you react? Where you too \"disgusted\" or even liked it (a fluffy belly and chest)? Was it a bad or a good experience?\n\nOr did you not give it a try because you knew from the looks that without clothes he would not be attractive at all? \n\nI am losing weight but in the meantime I feel like I don't want to disappoint the women I approach if they are first attracted by my personality and face/smile, big shoulders etc. (Everything that does not involve the body underneah). Sort of: they deserve better.\n\nTl;dr Are women disappointed when the expectations about a guy's physique is not met at all, but still like him for other things?",

She looked really uncomfortable. \n\nI don’t mind rejection. Nobody wants to be rejected though. It’s just the way that I get rejected that messes with me. It’s never like a no thank you. It’s always them giving me a weird face and saying something rude. It’s a club. What makes matters worse. That same girl tried her best to start grinding on this other guy after she rejected me. The other guy wasn’t interested but I guess he knew her. \n\nI just feel like maybe I have a bad reputation at that club or maybe I’m a lot more creepy than I think I am. I don’t know, but I don’t know if I want to keep going. Also I saw this hot girl twerking and people were slapping her butt. I was gonna do it but I figured if anyone gets in trouble for this it’s gonna be me. So I didn’t. \n\nTl;dr women never reject me in a nice way",

It was/has been super tough on me and as a consequence I'm hypochondriac and have a lot of anxiety with anything health related. My mother was my whole world and losing her broke me and I don't think I'll ever be the same. I've dealt with it all on my own by choice and I'm in a much better place mentally now. \n\nMy bestfriend of over a decade has recently learnt that her mother has cancer and obviously it has been super hard on her. I want to do everything I can to support her through it because I'm all she has in her corner rn.  She is also super sensitive and fragile and needs all the help she can get. But having these talks with her is super triggering to me and takes me to dark places because it takes me back to when we had to deal with it all as a family. \n\nI don't want to be selfish about this, and I'd like to support her through it all and be there for her as much as I can, since I know how hard this can be and what a huge toll it can take on a person. So any advice on how I can navigate helping her while also taking care of my own mental health would be very helpful. \n\nTDLR : How to help a friend out while having to deal with your own mental health.",

She has struggled with Borderline Personality Disorder and Depression for her entire adult life. She has threatened suicide on a few occasions, and regularly self harms when we fight.\n\nI have also struggled with depression, and have only taken serious steps towards getting better in the last year.\n\nThese mental health issues have obviously caused strain on the relationship, to the point where we have been on the brink of separation for months but we’ve both been fighting to stay together.\n\nOn Monday, she attempted to end her life by taking an extreme dose of Wellbutrin, significantly more than what is required to be fatal. For the next 3 days I sat next to her in hospital through deep hallucinations, violent outbursts, seizures and moments of complete collapse with drops in heart rate and breathing. A few times I really thought she had died, I would feverishly check her pulse and breathing while in a complete breakdown.  I could go into greater detail but I will save you the trauma, needless to say it was an intense experience. I stuck by her side the entire time in hospital, didn’t sleep, didn’t eat but I am happy to say she made it. She is now medically cleared, and was just cleared by the hospitals psychiatry team. \n\nNow that we are out of hospital, things are so bad between us. She feels betrayed that I called her parents and her closest friend to try and get some help in supporting her (she lives across the country from the rest of her support network, so it’s only me here). She is going in and out of manic states, saying she wished she had died, that she lied to the psychiatrists to get out of hospital and will harm herself again. She has said in manic moments that it is my fault she attempted suicide, because of a recent fight we had, and I am the only person who makes her feel that way.\n\nI called her mom, I called her best friend. I tried to talk her through everything, she is sleeping safely beside me as I type this. She says I have betrayed her, I have removed any trust she had in me and she can no longer talk to her friends or family because of me.\n\nI feel like such an asshole, I will absolutely not disappear on this woman without a structured support network in place, I just can’t be the only support for her right now. I have my own mental health issues and experienced some pretty intense trauma watching her almost die for 3 days. \n\nSo anyways.. she said she would kill herself if I called her friends and family, and put blame on me for her first attempt. I called them anyway.\n\nCan I walk away from this relationship? How do I do it? Call me an asshole or tell me what you would do.\n\ntl;dr my partner attempted to end her life, she put blame on me for her attempt, and said she would try again if I contacted her friends and family.

I come downstairs and he's making a snack, I say \"can you please bring down the laundry because I need to do a load\" \"this late at night?\" \"Well no, but can you bring it down tonight because there are wet towels sitting there\". I make salad for us both and am bumbling about and give him a salad, we eat. He asks for more, I offer to make it (everythings good). In between him eating his snack and me serving the salad there was about a little over an hour. He eats his second bowl, I bumble about again and he tells me to sit and just relax, (all while hes playing a game on his phone, no worries all good, he'll do the dishes later). My cats are screaming to be fed in the meantime so I get up after a second of sitting and go upstairs to feed them, as I'm coming down I remember the soggy pile of dirty laundry I asked bf to take down 2 hours(ish) ago. Now I'm annoyed. I come downstairs with said laundry and he senses something is wrong and asks. I say \"I'm really frustrated that I asked you to take down the laundry and I ended up having to do it, even tho my back hurts today\" he goes \"you never told me when I had to do it by and i was eating!\" and I freak out and go \"don't you dare -curseword- gaslight me!\" He gets annoyed that I expected it to be done immediately and im annoyed because um you weren't eating for 2 hours straight. You could have gotten up (even brought your phone upstairs so you don't lose your game) and bring down the laundry! \n\n\nI'm convinced this is gaslighting. Am I correct? Am I wrong?",

We live together and have a pretty great relationship, but recently I have been feeling undesirable and wishing I had more genuine interest from my partner. We talk about it and he says I'm beautiful of course he loves me, but that doesn't change that he seems so disengaged and stuck in his phone lately. Part of it could be my own insecurities though, as I've been dealing with health issues that affect our intimacy lately.\n\n\nSo let's get into it. My partner has a Twitter account for online friends/gaming and since I'm not really active on there, we don't follow each other. I am pretty positive they think I don't know about it, but I also feel they're actively keeping it discreet. (Will go private and change usernames) \n\n\nPrior to this I never really cared about my partner's online activity. I trust him and he talks often about his online friends so I felt like I was in the loop. But a few months ago, I looked into their Twitter for potential birthday gift ideas and I was really confused about what I found. Different pronouns than I know them by, a whole different personality, and simping/flirting with friends in a way that makes me pretty uncomfortable. I wouldn't say there's anything outright incriminating but, this definitely feels like a level of micro cheating and I can only wonder what their private conversations are like. I didn't tell him of my discovery but I asked some general questions about these friends he's talked about for 1+ year (we have even discussed meeting some of these people!) but he became tense and uncomfortable, brushed it off and just told me they speak \"pretty infrequently\" lol. I feel that pretty much confirms my fears. \n\n\nI guess I am seeking advice on how to bring this up. The reason I haven't yet is because I have taken time to consider the way this makes me feel, wondering if my concerns are valid or if I'm just being insecure. And if I'm being insecure, I don't wish to hurt him or police his friendships. I also don't want to put them in an uncomfortable position with their gender identity, or the fact that I happened upon their social media without their knowledge \n\nTo prevent having to come out to me prematurely, I was considering not bringing up the discovery at all. And instead, trying to establish solid boundaries with social media and how we behave online. But that may be sus as I have almost no social media whatsoever lol. \n\n\nTIA for different perspectives &amp; advice.\n\n\nTL;DR my partner's secret account &amp; online behavior make me uncomfortable and I don't know how to approach.",

A guy who was pretty cute matched with me. A little older than myself (I’m 30, he was “37”). I tend to have cute guys match with me a lot, so I thought nothing of it. But this guy was very open. We chatted for a bit. Then yesterday of another day of talking he told me this story about himself and how he was in the army years ago, but got hurt, was retired and his eventually his wife of 2 years left because of PTSD and what happened to him (his story was in more detail I’m just summing it up). \n\nHe was in my town, even wanted to meet up eventually this week but I’m sick right now, so I said no. We chatted all day today, I gave him my number too. I asked to chat on the phone today but he gave me the run around. I got suspicious of his photos, it was just a feeling. I PimEyes it and found out it wasn’t even him. I told the creep off saying I found the real photos, saying how horrible it was to catfish and make up stories like that. And then I blocked them.\n\nI was bummed and angry. I shared some personal things with this person - mainly how I understood their PTSD because I have it and a guy I actually dated was a marine veteran (and who still comes in and out of my life) and he has PTSD and I understood what it was like to deal with someone whose seen things. And one of old friends is in Ukraine fighting and sends me stuff all the time and told me how they deal and got blown up. So I’ve kinda was able to understand and felt bad for this person. \n\nI’ve been on and off dating sites for years (when not in a relationship) and this was a first. Luckily, I found out quickly within a couple days, but now I’m scared to use dating apps again unless they FaceTime me or send video snaps.\n\nTL;DR: Got catfished.",

        "text": "TLDR; i have a fear of being indebted to people but my boyfriend loves to buy me gifts and pay for my things. i no longer have the funds to match his spending and asked him to stop. i have offered alternatives to him like making me things but he’s not listening. what do i do? \n\nhello,\n\nwe’ve been together for 10 months and i love my boyfriend but there are some things about us that are different and it’s starting to stress me out an incredible amount—that being that he loves buying me things and paying for my things to express his love and i hate it.\n\nwhy do i hate receiving gifts + having my things paid for? i feel an incredible sense of debt toward the person doing it. i interpret it as a silent ‘you now owe me.’ \n\ni was raised in an abusive home where anything my parents did for me was held over my head and used as leverage to guilt trip me and make me do things i didn’t want to do. constantly hearing things like ‘you know i could easily take this away from you right?’ and ‘after everything i do for you, giving you a home and food and this is how you act?’ now makes me feel a huge sense of urgency when it comes to re-paying my debts and making sure the score is even so nobody can make me feel like i owe them.\n\ni also grew up poor and am incredibly money conscious. i’m currently living with my parents and they will constantly threaten to kick me out whenever we fight. i suffer with various mental illnesses and am paying for my own therapy and medication but am not stable enough to work so i’m relying on my savings—i am also so worried about having enough money in case my parents make good on their threats to kick me out. \n\nmy boyfriend’s the opposite and has rich parents. he’s not money conscious even when he should be. he’s spent so much money on me buying me gifts and dinner. and i know in my mind that’s just how he expresses his affection. he does the same for friends and family. it’s incredibly sweet and i know it’s well-intentioned.\n\nevery time my boyfriend buys me something i will do the same for him. every time he pays for a meal i will do the same for him. i would even go as far to say i’ve paid for dinner more than he has. just to keep it even, because i feel this choking fear of having a debt towards somebody.\n\nbut i’m running low on money, i’m not mentally well enough to work and i need to keep going to therapy. it’s so important that i get help because i am so ill i can hardly function and i’m the only person i can rely to pay for it—my family would never lift a finger to help.\n\ni’ve explained why his gift giving stresses me out, i’ve explained that i have anxiety when it comes to money. i’ve proposed that he makes me gifts instead rather than buying me things but he always just says ‘it’s not his thing.’ i propose we stay in and make food instead of always going out to eat (we go out to eat SO MUCH when we’re together and i hate it.)\n\nbut he still won’t stop wanting to go out to eat, he still won’t stop buying me things. i have cried and actually begged him to stop, saying i don’t have money and can’t return the favor anymore and that him doing these things for me stresses me out more than makes me happy. i have begged him to stop just until i have a job and can do my part but he just won’t listen to me. it gets harder and harder for me to fake a smile and i get poorer, more depressed and resentful. \n\nhe always just insists that he expects nothing in return and he’s doing it because he loves me but i just can’t take it anymore. i can’t handle him paying without feeling crushing guilt and i can’t handle spending money i need for my treatment.\n\nwhat do i do? how can i get over the crushing fear i get when people buy me things? a regular at my old job once got me a crystal and i stayed up at night stressing about what i could do to repay them.\n\ni’m trying to work at this in therapy but it’s so painful for me to just let him keep getting me things and take us out. i even feel guilty getting myself treats once in a while because it worries me that i won’t have enough money to pay him back for things he gets me. i get nightmares where i’m screaming at him to just listen to me but nothing comes out.\n\nwhat do i do?? i’m so tired of feeling like this.. i feel like an ungrateful wench but i can’t help it. i don’t know what kind kf boundary to set either.",

        "text": "My father passed away 4 years ago and I just found out last week. I was talking casually with a relative and they told me that my father was an alcoholic. I had no clue. And I honestly didn't even believe them, but I asked my mom and she confirmed it. I am in shock. I had no clue. I knew he had other vices (workaholic, gambling, smoking cigs, etc), but alcoholic? I can barely remember ever seeing my dad drink. There wasn't any alcohol like that in my house. No drinks were ever had at dinners, even special occasions (Christmas, Thanksgiving, etc), so HOW was he able to hide this and furthermore how did I not see any of it? I feel so shocked, a bit lost and a bit in denial? I want to ask my mom more questions but honestly I am feeling a strong sense of denial + shame about even discussing it. I feel so fooled and confused and sad. How did I not see ANY of it? How did I not know? And lastly, how did this really impact my childhood? All those times where he wasn't showing up to events I thought it was because he didn't care and was too preoccupied with work. Now the fact that he could've been drinking/drunk? Seriously? I'm just completely lost.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr: found out my father was a closeted alcoholic and now my entire life + childhood is being reevaluated.",

She apologized, did everything to work out the relationship and she made things up to me. This went for 2 months. I still kept on bringing the issue and ask her questions. One night, I asked her a question regarding our issue. Then, the next day, she said that our relationship will not fix the issue, that meant she broke up with me. I told her I wanted to work the relationship out this time and that I wanted us to sit down and talk heart to heart. But, she refused because we already talked about it many times. But our relationship is long distance, and communication is mainly chat and call.\n\nit's been a couple of months since then. She moved away to another country without meeting me. Now, I'm left with unresolved feelings. We are still in contact from time to time and in good terms. Should I tell her about my unresolved issue/feelings?\n\ntldr: ex broke up with me due to an issue that can't seem to be resolved, but I told her I wanted to work the relationship out by having a heart to heart talk, but she refused  becauase we already talked about it. She moved out to another country without us meeting up.I'm left with unresolved feelings.",

Me (M18)and her (F18) My first relationship and her fifth. It’s been over a month and a half into the relationship. \n\nToday she was somewhat drier than usual over text for a couple hours after I dropped her off at home and my mind went on a whole tangent and started overthinking. It started with a simple, “damn I’m Bored asf” in my mind to “what if she found someone else”. This was just the most recent example of my overthinking. \n\nIt keeps stressing me out for no reason and I know I’m my frontal cortex that it’s so stupid that I’m thinking all this but my emotions and mind keep going elsewhere. One of my former best friends tried to instill all these feelings in me once but i’d like to think I’m over that now.\n\nThough, I think the main contributor to my overthinking ever since the beginning is all the stuff about cheating and unfaithfulness I see on social media. According to what I see online, almost everyone gets cheated on in a terrible way and each story makes my gut wrench. I try to avoid this stuff obv\n\nI’m 98% sure she’d never do that because of things she’s said but Anyone have words of advice or thoughts? I wonder if everyone goes through this the first time ? How do I get rid of this state of mind for good?\n\nTLDR: I overthink every small thing and it’s getting stressful asf. Advice?",

        "text": "I’ve been dating my gf for 2 and a half years and we are now both in college but I started one year before her. We go to the same school. Its a pretty big party school but before coming here she didnt party at all even when she was friends with the party type. She just wouldnt go to the big party scenes or drink or smoke. Once she got here she has been a consistent partier at least once a week and often both friday and saturday night. She says its the only way to make and keep friends and while I dont drink and also dont have a huge huge social circle, I still have friends. I dont have a problem with her choice to party or drink, but she never wants me to come and always cites reasons like parties only accepting girls or that she doesnt want to be focused on me at the parties, she wants to be with her friends. Nevertheless lots and lots of times her friends that arent single will bring their boyfriends or they will have a group of guys go with them that they befriended through a club or class or something. She also says its because I dont drink and that the parties are only fun if you drink. At first I accepted it but as I have begun to be the on call taxi for them more and more, she is dressed more and more revealing, and they start going to more frat and athlete team parties and not just parties through their direct friends/clubs/circles, I have started to feel pretty insecure about it. Anytime I bring it up in any way (I’ve tried gentle questions and more direct approach) she gets hostile and tells me that we’re in college and she wants to have other friends and have the college experience while shes here and that I need to respect that I’m not always (ever) invited.\n\nI guess what sent me over the edge is when a couple of people (one of my friends plus one of her friends boyfriends that happened to be over one time when I came to drop her off) have asked me in a quiet/private moment basically the exact same question: “how do you deal with her going out all the time without you? that would make me really uncomfortable”. And that’s when I started thinking maybe I’m not having unrealistic feelings. \n\nShe has never been a very sexually driven girl either but we are occasionally intimate and it’s only slightly declined from before but I really dont think shes cheating. We just don’t even see each other that much. On average once a week, twice at most, for a meal or doing something for an hour or two. Thats why I’m confused why she might feel like I’m socially overbearing and want to keep me out of her party life. Yet if I don’t respond to texts or calls nearly immediately she gets worried or frustrated. But she can go 12-36 hours without responding and it’s ok because it was a weekend night and she was with her friends and then asleep or she was busy or whatever. So it feels very one way. But when I talk about maybe being a bit less committed and taking a more casual approach to our relationship she will say no no no and be super interactive and want lots of time together for a few days until she feels like shes won me back over. \n\nBut we had a wonderful and super healthy relationship before about 6 months ago. Families love each other and both of us, everything is good besides the one sided flexibility that she seems to want. I have offered to drink at the parties to see if that truly was the reason and she says “no I don’t want you getting drunk or anything and then it becomes a disaster”. \n\nSo I’m lost. I seriously don’t think she’s cheating but I also don’t know how to address it without falling into her “if you don’t want me to be able to have the college experience you’re being ridiculous and over controlling” response. Every other guy’s invite has a reason. Some other connection, he drinks, somebody who has more social power than her invited him so she didn’t control it and she doesn’t want to be liked less because she drags along her boyfriend when a good portion of the girls are single, on and on.\n\nHow do I best approach this? Accept it? Is this normal? It seems like other relationships aren’t this way but maybe it’s just my perception.\n\nSorry for the extremely long post and I can’t even figure out where to go with a tl;dr on this because of all the background needed.",
