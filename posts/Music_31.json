We then discover that the guy is actually married, but the wife is a not a nice person.\n\nThe wife discovers his affair and plans a revenge.\nShe invites the blind girl who doesn't know he is married to play piano in their house, while they are having dinner. He is shocked when he sees the girl, and the wife smiles because her revenge worked.\nThe girl finds out about all of this and leaves crying, and the man is really sad too.\n\nI can't remmeber the end, but hopefully that is enough information to help you find it.\n\nThe woman singing whilst the story develops is near a piano and dressed in white\n\nAnd it is not Kiss - because I am a girl",
