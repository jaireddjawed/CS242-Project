Puffin is planning to do this in order to make it children friendly read as Dahls work consist of offensive language. But can't they just write new stuff for children instead of modifying a writers creation? \n\nWhat's actually happening in this case? Can anyone shed some light? \n\nFor context this link consist of screenshot of modified version: https://twitter.com/incunabula/status/1626860237104857089?t=5_evtVr5J8lcfwCO6c5l6A&amp;s=19",

This was what I thought most likely happened before they found the body, and right now it seems like I was right. Why was there any \"controversy\" over this in the first place? I wouldn't say it is \"common\", but if someone goes missing next to a fast-flowing river it's fair to assume they fell in right?\n\nInstead, I've been seeing news mentioning \"conspiracy theories\" about her disappearance, harassment of her family, interference with investigations, etc. What made this case any different from any other missing person's case, and what social media harassment happened? I'm also seeing stuff criticising the police's handling of the matter - though I agree it's kind of odd (and perhaps incompetent) of them to not find the body until a random pedestrian eventually did, I don't know much about underwater searches so I can't testify to whether it was very difficult. However, there is also criticism about the police's late release of Nicola's health information to the public (?) and outrage about this, which I am totally OOTL on. What did the police do wrong in this case?",

Because YouTube’s recommendation can recommend violent videos sometimes, and one of those videos might have been something about the terrorists before it got taken down, then they’re aiding the terrorists?\n\nHow is this even a case because it makes absolutely no sense to me. Why is it possibly “the end of the internet”, and the shooting happened like 8 years ago so why is it just now an issue?",

        "text": "Jack Horner is this paleontologist that's been in the business a long time. He made lots of big finds, but everyone hates him for his extremely controversial opinions; such as the whole \"Tyrannosaurus was 100% a scavenger\" nonsense, which he openly admitted he only said because he hates T Rex because he is a Hadrosaur fanboy. He even fed his hot takes to Universal during several Jurassic Park movies instead of actual facts to further his agenda rather than actually educate the audiences. Yes we all know Jack Horner is a bad person. But lately I've been seeing the dude being portrayed as this giant fat guy with pink hair that shoots people and everyone calls an \"irredeemable monster\" across the internet, like some kind of soyjak on steroids. Is this because Jack Horner was involved in some recent controversy I'm unaware of? I don't pay attention to left right political controversy like most people do.\n\nThis is his page on wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Horner_(paleontologist)",
