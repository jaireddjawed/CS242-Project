        "text": "i have dediced to delve deeper into kafka's work recently and this short story seemed as good a place as any.\n\nreading this i think i got what dfw and deleuze were trying to get at when speaking of kafka as a humorous author: many points in this piece, especially at the beginning, have a humorous quality due to the absurdity of the situation itself and a main character so slave to his job routine that that is pretty much his main concern for most of the story. of course this doesn't last long as the story quickly turns into a tragic farce.\n\neven though kafka isn't known as a writer of especially deep characters, the situation and behavior of the family is really believable (as far as a story can be believable with this premise anyway). you quickly see the family's behavior turn from apprehension to annoyance to finally resentment. if i had to criticize something, i'd say that the character of the father (mr. samsa) seems the most comically villainous as he almost doesn't seem to care about his son at all. at least his sister and mother do show some empathy at the beginning. i guess this is one of those cases where kafka's feelings for his father override the story. the way the story is built it can be read as almost anything (a metaphor for the ill, a satire of capitalism, an interpersonal story about a dysfunctional family) and i'm willing to bet this is one of the main reasons why it stayed so powerful throughout all of these years (that and obviously the sheer ridicolousness of the premise itself).\n\nfinally, i wanted to bring some attention to the ending. through a peculiar choice of words kafka seems to imply or at least suggest that a similar future is in store for gregory's sister. even if she doesn't ultimately turn into a bug (a likely possibility) i think the same process of economic exploitation ultimately awaits her. a fitting ending for such a cynical story",

        "text": "“Pigeon Feathers” by John Updike (1962) is a story that is probably familiar to all of us but that we don’t discuss often: the moment in our childhood that we become aware of the permanence and unknowns of death, and the existential panic that comes along with that thought. \n\nThe story’s main character, David, is a 13-year-old boy who has recently moved into an old farm with his family. Out of boredom and a desire to make his new home less disorienting, he visits the family bookshelf. It is there he comes across H. G. Wells’ “The Outline of History” and comes across Wells’ cynical (depending on your vantage point) explanation that Christ was a historical figure that survived an execution attempt and that any and all miracles associated to him were coincidental or made up. This new thought causes David to panic about what death without the promise of Heaven looks like. \n\nHis parents and pastor are of no help to him - the adults make the situation worse. David becomes withdrawn and sullen - he doesn’t have the ability to communicate his fears easily. Things turn around for him, though, when his grandmother asks him to kill some pigeons that have taken up in the barn. David doesn’t particularly want to kill anything, but once he starts he becomes methodical about it. \n\nWhile burying the dead birds, David notices the feathers and this is what ultimately reassures him of his fears. Updike wrote this in such a way that not only could I understand David’s concerns, but I was transported back to my own childhood and when this loss of innocence occurred. A truly wonderful story by an American classic. \n\nQuotable: “… with a feminine, slipping sensation along his arms that seemed to give the air hands, he was robed in this certainty: that the god who has lavished such craft upon these worthless birds would not destroy His own Creation by refusing to let David live forever”.",

(without spoilers if possible)\n\nThank you very much in advance for your precious advices!\n\nPS: Sorry for my English, this is not my native language.\nI will read the books in French, I'm an avid reader and I know that I will not be discouraged from reading his other books if this one seems less interesting. My question really has to do with the chronology and the importance of this book for understanding the whole story. Thanks again!",

        "text": "**On Generosity and Magnificence, Nicomachean Ethics Book IV. Chs 1 &amp; 2 - my commentary, notes and reflections**\n\n**Aristotle’s Nicomachean Ethics Book IV - notes**\n\n**Chapters 1 and 2 - On Generosity and Magnificence**\n\nWe humans are animals of community. From our hands to those of another it was with the giving and receiving of goods that we strengthened our bonds within our community and the foundations of the community entire. As we gathered to form villages and our villages grew into cities, so did the exchange of goods become systematised and grow proportionally more complex and dynamic.\n\nMoney was not merely a practical invention, it was a necessity. To name just a few of the reasons why money was necessary, we invented money (i) to avoid having to keep track of tables of complex ever-changing equivalences (e.g. 4 bushels of wheat = 2 pounds of butter = 1 ingot of iron), (ii) to enlarge the scope of trading itself by increasing the range of goods one person could buy as well as the range of people one could sell to, (iii) to enable a person to sell the perishable goods of one season with a view to buying those harvested later in the year. Money was a boon for every community and readily embraced as an institution. Money was made to serve us.\n\nYet today, more than any other point in our history, we live to serve money. Once upon a time we transacted to gain the goods we needed. Today the purpose of most transactions is to make more money. Spread across the histories of different people we will find celebrated instances of industrious chieftains, leaders and mayors who gathered goods and money to safeguard the growth and wellbeing of their community. Now we celebrate business oriented individuals who know how to organise humans into companies and corporations, i.e. communities whose purpose is to safeguard the growth and wellbeing of such and such a business person’s money accounts.\n\nThe means have become the ends. The ends have become the means. We entertain the fantasy that humans are higher than other animals. Have we considered that we have perhaps fallen lower than other animals? There are parents in the USA - out of all countries - who work multiple jobs to afford rent and utilities. Woodpeckers dig a hole in a tree and get their housing rent-free… and what exactly is the difference in labour conditions between a child cobalt miner in the Congo, a Foxconn factory worker in China and a battery caged chicken? Chicken in battery cages are animals we reduced to our own image. Afterall, we let ourselves be managed as resources by the human resources department when we could have been managing money resources as participants of the department of communal wellbeing.\n\nWhat has gone wrong? Well, had humanity been a great tree, then money would have been the dead shadow that this tree cast. Stop looking at the shadow and its trinkets with such wonder and take more time looking at the tree, i.e. looking at each other. That is where life is. There is where wonder resides and dreams first hatch. Learn to engage with other people and spark fire in their eyes. Learn to relate with others, to form genuine friendships, to empower your fellow human beings and you will find greater things than the yachts and Lamborghinis the media puts before you. That is what health magazines imply when they print tepid headlines like “studies show that stable relationships decrease health risk”. Human nature is when individual humans come together to form friendships and households and communities. The greatest life we can live is one spent as members of a community based on friendship and mutual trust. That is truly something! This we can call luxury. All these shiny objects they try to sell us… are the food of vultures!\n\nAristotle lived in a world much crueller than our own. There were no human rights nor any other guarantees of security that we get to enjoy today. Yet, the world in which Aristotle lived was much more politically dynamic and community oriented than our own. Ιt is under such conditions that he and other greats of his age saw (i) those engaged with their community as more valuable and worthy than the “ιδιώται” - idiotai -, i.e. the private individuals and (ii) money as a means for the empowerment of the community, not its end. Aristotle neither glorified money nor dismissed it. He put it in its proper place.\n\n**Chapter 1 - On Generosity**\n\n**(a)** **Introduction - the scope of generosity:** In the second book of the Nicomachean Ethics, we learned that a virtue of character is a particular attitude or disposition which a virtuous person holds towards something. In the third book, Aristotle first emphasised that virtue involves both how we choose to think and how we choose to act under variable circumstances. We then came to understand that courage is a disposition towards fear and that moderation a disposition towards pleasure.\n\n***What is then the scope of generosity?*** Well, generosity is the virtuous disposition towards the giving and taking of wealth. “Especially the giving part” Aristotle underlines then explains that by wealth he specifically means “all the things whose value is measured by money.”\n\n(**b) Generosity as a mean between two extremes:** For our sake and so that we can more easily conceptualise what a virtue is and comprehend why we should aim to acquire it, Aristotle provides us with a metaphorical schema based on proportions. Here we refer to the schema of the virtuous mean between the extremes of excess and deficiency.\n\nTo illustrate, let us say we have company and we want to prepare coffee for everyone. The optimal way to go about this is (i) neither to prepare too little coffee for there will not be enough for everyone, (ii) nor too much coffee for whatever remains will go bad and be wasted. Instead what we want is (iii) to prepare just enough coffee so that everyone gets their share and none of it goes to waste. To achieve this we take our experiences with coffee making into account and roughly calculate beforehand how much to make. We might miss the mark a few times in the beginning but with enough practice we will get the hang of it.\n\n***How does generosity fit in Aristotle’s schema?***  So far we have learned that generosity is the virtuous disposition towards the giving and taking of money. Aristotle places generosity as the virtuous mean between miserliness and extravagance. Miserliness points to deficiency in giving money and is often paired with an aptness for taking it. Extravagance, on the other hand, stands for such an excess in the proportion of the giving that it either leads to the financial ruin of the giver or compromises the way such a person takes.\n\n(**c) Generosity as opposed to extravagance and miserliness:** We first defined the scope of generosity as a disposition towards the giving and taking of money. We then placed it within the framework of the mean and extrapolated extravagance and miserliness as two dispositions opposed both to generosity and to each other within the same scope. To gain a higher definition understanding of each disposition, and especially generosity, we will now look at them side by side and in more detail.\n\n**(i) Generosity:** Aristotle, first and foremost, defines the generous as those who know how to give “the right amount of money to the right people at the right time” and who are disposed to do that “with pleasure, or at least without pain.”\n\nSuch a definition precludes blind or random charity. It points to a systematised approach to sharing and to those generous as possessing certain experience and knowledge in benefiting others. We may say that generous people subscribe to a clear and practical vision of what good they want to achieve and what it takes to achieve it. This also implies that they actively partake in communal matters and have intimate knowledge of the various problems and challenges that arise both in particular cases and in the community overall. To provide just a few examples, a person may instantiate their generosity through contributions towards (i) merit-based scholarships for young people who are driven and have potential but lack means, (ii) the building or repair of communal amenities such as roads and waterworks, or (iii) the relief of those who met unforeseen disaster. (e.g. war, floods, fires e.t.c)\n\nWe understand, of course, that for someone to be in a position to give away money, they must have a measure of wealth in the first place. To this effect, Aristotle underlines that a generous person is cautious not to compromise their own wellbeing by giving beyond what they can afford. With that said, they do not feel any inclination to engage in sordid dealings of any kind, however profitable, for the ultimate object of their desire and attention is not money but the welfare of their community.\n\n**(ii) Extravagance:** The extravagant are disposed to live beyond their means. Aristotle explains further that they maintain neither a proper measure to their spending nor a proper approach. With this criteria in mind, we may call someone extravagant in any number of cases. In particular, we may call extravagant those who:\n\n* naively engage in haphazard money arrangements (e.g. “honey, I just took all our savings and invested it in a Kazakhstani tupperware start-up.”)\n* let some form of addiction get the better of them financially (e.g. “Bill blew his inheritance on gambling and drugs.”)\n* conjure a spectacle of luxuriousness they cannot afford (e.g. “Hello grandma! Yeah, it’s Tim. I need you to lend me money so I can cover my monthly Tesla payment.”)\n* waste money on various species of lackeys, flatterers and pleasers (e.g. “Ben gifted a brand new luxury car to an escort.”\n* some combination of the above\n\nNo matter how extravagant someone is or in what way, Aristotle states that we can still help them improve their ways if they are willing to listen. In absence of that, however, and provided the circumstances appear, such a person might compromise their character further by engaging in sordid dealings to prop up their spending habits.\n\n**(iii) Miserliness:** Money is a miser’s god and hoarding it the noblest possible activity. We typically perceive such people as crooks and more often than not they are exactly crooks. For we call misers either (i) those who go to great lengths to not give away one penny when their immediate personal gain is not concerned, or (ii) those who greedily take every cent they can without considering the wellbeing of others, the source of the money, their own reputation.\n\nMisers venerate money and hold it as an object worthy of love and admiration. They think money has value in itself. They are somehow blind to the fact that money gains its value only insofar as a community willingly holds it as a standard of exchange of goods and services. In today’s terms, we may characterise such a person as a money fetishist. Their mind is only occupied with matters of money. Their view of the world is so twisted that they think that money makes the world go around.\n\nThey remind of a farmer who found a fruit bearing tree and eagerly gathered the fruit in sacks for himself but never bothered to water the tree, to fertilise it, to prune it, to protect it from disease. The next year he returned to gather more fruit, yet he bitterly noted that the harvest was small and did not taste good. He started shouting at the tree that it was “lazy” and should “pull itself up by its bootstraps.”\n\nAristotle states that the miser misses the mark of virtue by a far greater distance than the extravagant man. Misers are thus more greatly opposed to those generous than the extravagant.\n\n**Chapter 2 - On Magnificence**\n\n(**a) The scope of magnificence:** Aristotle moves on to magnificence. Both generosity and magnificence are character dispositions towards wealth. To this extent, the two virtues are related. They do not exactly map onto each other, however. Given that we have a fair grasp of what generosity is, let us learn more about magnificence by figuring out in which manner it is distinct to generosity.\n\n***How is magnificence distinct to generosity?*** Generosity concerns itself with how people give and take money in general and regardless of the sums involved. Magnificence specifically considers the manner people of great wealth sponsor their community. We may talk of how they provide for its defence or fund its religious functions and events. We deal here only with large sums. To put this in other words, a magnificent person is definitely generous but a generous person can only be magnificent if they also possess great wealth.\n\nWe note here that the ancient Greeks held the belief that only the wealthy could afford to venerate the gods and sacrifice to them, at least on behalf of a city. In this way, all wealthy men were expected to task themselves with the funding and organisation of all the religious ceremonies and events which took place each year. Among such events we count athletic competitions such as the Olympic Games or dramatic festivals such as the Dionysia where the famous playwrights Aeschylus, Sophocles, Eurypides competed against others. This is the historical and cultural context in which Aristotle participates and from which he derives magnificence as a virtue.\n\n***What is then the scope of magnificence?*** Magnificence is the virtuous disposition wealthy persons may demonstrate when they contribute towards the public good, i.e. act as patrons of their community. As patrons they may e.g. sponsor religious events and ceremonies, fund the building and maintenance of city infrastructure, help with the organisation of the military, among other things.\n\n(**b) Magnificence as the mean between two extremes:** So far, we have reached an understanding of the scope of magnificence. To do this, we first compared it to generosity and then considered the cultural and historical background from which magnificence proceeds.\n\nTo further refine our grasp of this concept, we now consider its position on Aristotle’s schema of the virtuous mean, identify the dispositions which stand for excess and deficiency, and place all three dispositions side by side to discuss them.\n\n***How does magnificence fit in Aristotle’s schema?*** Magnificence is the mean. It is the virtue of someone wealthy who knows how to use money to bring about great things. Now, on the side of excess we find gaudiness. We call a person gaudy when they combine being a pretentious show-off with lacking any sense of taste or proportion. Meanwhile, on the side of deficiency we locate niggardliness. The niggardly we identify as someone who always tries to give the bare minimum and always complains about giving too much.\n\nLet us now consider the three dispositions more closely:\n\n**(i) Magnificence:** Like painters bring brush to canvas and sculptors set chisel against marble, so do those magnificent know to use their wealth to bring about greatness and beauty and inspire wonder in their people’s eyes. It is for this reason that Aristotle says that those disposed to magnificence are like artists.\n\nTo be magnificent we have to be attuned to the constantly changing challenges and needs that our community faces and know what actionable steps to take to meet such challenges and needs. We have to be able to distinguish new and emerging trends and ideas in people’s minds and be capable of encouraging and establishing trends towards good destinations, starving out all the trends which lead to no good in the process.\n\n**Magnificent humans** are not mere wealthy persons, they are celebrated personalities. Children look up to them. They get to speak for their entire community. They are not merely generous, they **are like a river to their people**.\n\n**(ii) Gaudiness:** Like the magnificent, those we describe as gaudy have no problem with putting their wealth to use. Unlike the magnificent, however, the gaudy are completely out of touch with their community. They rather use luxuriousness as a tool to reinforce the distance in status between them and everyone else. They want to make sure that everyone knows that they stand above everyone else and in this way weaponise their wealth to antagonise everyone. A good example would be the anecdote of that man who launched himself in space while his slaves were not even allowed proper bathroom breaks.\n\n**(iii) Niggardliness:** We deal here with the miser written large. Even as they possess overwhelming amounts of wealth, they are still stuck compulsively collecting money. To the needs and challenges of their community, they react with their doctrine of “money for money’s sake” and “money above all”, i.e. with a theology of money. We deal here with petty crooks devoid of self-respect. Wherever they can, they go around causing difficulties and complications to avoid giving their fair share. They have no qualms about raising a great fuss to save a few cents. Whatever trifle they did give, they will keep reminding everyone about it and make it appear as though they parted with a great fortune. Such is the disposition of the niggardly person\n\nHere I end my accounts on Aristotelian generosity, magnificence and the dispositions related to them.\n\n***Would you like to read more of my work?

To name just a few of the reasons why money was necessary, we invented money (i) to avoid having to keep track of tables of complex ever-changing equivalences (e.g. 4 bushels of wheat = 2 pounds of butter = 1 ingot of iron), (ii) to enlarge the scope of trading itself by increasing the range of goods one person could buy as well as the range of people one could sell to, (iii) to enable a person to sell the perishable goods of one season with a view to buying those harvested later in the year. Money was a boon for every community and readily embraced as an institution. Money was made to serve us.\n\nYet today, more than any other point in our history, we live to serve money. Once upon a time we transacted to gain the goods we needed. Today the purpose of most transactions is to make more money. Spread across the histories of different people we will find celebrated instances of industrious chieftains, leaders and mayors who gathered goods and money to safeguard the growth and wellbeing of their community. Now we celebrate business oriented individuals who know how to organise humans into companies and corporations, i.e. communities whose purpose is to safeguard the growth and wellbeing of such and such a business person’s money accounts.\n\nThe means have become the ends. The ends have become the means. We entertain the fantasy that humans are higher than other animals. Have we considered that we have perhaps fallen lower than other animals? There are parents in the USA - out of all countries - who work multiple jobs to afford rent and utilities. Woodpeckers dig a hole in a tree and get their housing rent-free… and what exactly is the difference in labour conditions between a child cobalt miner in the Congo, a Foxconn factory worker in China and a battery caged chicken? Chicken in battery cages are animals we reduced to our own image. Afterall, we let ourselves be managed as resources by the human resources department when we could have been managing money resources as participants of the department of communal wellbeing.\n\nWhat has gone wrong? Well, had humanity been a great tree, then money would have been the dead shadow that this tree cast. Stop looking at the shadow and its trinkets with such wonder and take more time looking at the tree, i.e. looking at each other. That is where life is. There is where wonder resides and dreams first hatch. Learn to engage with other people and spark fire in their eyes. Learn to relate with others, to form genuine friendships, to empower your fellow human beings and you will find greater things than the yachts and Lamborghinis the media puts before you. That is what health magazines imply when they print tepid headlines like “studies show that stable relationships decrease health risk”. Human nature is when individual humans come together to form friendships and households and communities. The greatest life we can live is one spent as members of a community based on friendship and mutual trust. That is truly something! This we can call luxury. All these shiny objects they try to sell us… are the food of vultures!\n\nAristotle lived in a world much crueller than our own. There were no human rights nor any other guarantees of security that we get to enjoy today. Yet, the world in which Aristotle lived was much more politically dynamic and community oriented than our own. Ιt is under such conditions that he and other greats of his age saw (i) those engaged with their community as more valuable and worthy than the “ιδιώται” - idiotai -, i.e. the private individuals and (ii) money as a means for the empowerment of the community, not its end. Aristotle neither glorified money nor dismissed it. He put it in its proper place.\n\n**Chapter 1 - On Generosity**\n\n**(a)** **Introduction - the scope of generosity:** In the second book of the Nicomachean Ethics, we learned that a virtue of character is a particular attitude or disposition which a virtuous person holds towards something. In the third book, Aristotle first emphasised that virtue involves both how we choose to think and how we choose to act under variable circumstances. We then came to understand that courage is a disposition towards fear and that moderation a disposition towards pleasure.\n\n***What is then the scope of generosity?*** Well, generosity is the virtuous disposition towards the giving and taking of wealth. “Especially the giving part” Aristotle underlines then explains that by wealth he specifically means “all the things whose value is measured by money.”\n\n(**b) Generosity as a mean between two extremes:** For our sake and so that we can more easily conceptualise what a virtue is and comprehend why we should aim to acquire it, Aristotle provides us with a metaphorical schema based on proportions. Here we refer to the schema of the virtuous mean between the extremes of excess and deficiency.\n\nTo illustrate, let us say we have company and we want to prepare coffee for everyone. The optimal way to go about this is (i) neither to prepare too little coffee for there will not be enough for everyone, (ii) nor too much coffee for whatever remains will go bad and be wasted. Instead what we want is (iii) to prepare just enough coffee so that everyone gets their share and none of it goes to waste. To achieve this we take our experiences with coffee making into account and roughly calculate beforehand how much to make. We might miss the mark a few times in the beginning but with enough practice we will get the hang of it.\n\n***How does generosity fit in Aristotle’s schema?***  So far we have learned that generosity is the virtuous disposition towards the giving and taking of money. Aristotle places generosity as the virtuous mean between miserliness and extravagance. Miserliness points to deficiency in giving money and is often paired with an aptness for taking it. Extravagance, on the other hand, stands for such an excess in the proportion of the giving that it either leads to the financial ruin of the giver or compromises the way such a person takes.\n\n(**c) Generosity as opposed to extravagance and miserliness:** We first defined the scope of generosity as a disposition towards the giving and taking of money. We then placed it within the framework of the mean and extrapolated extravagance and miserliness as two dispositions opposed both to generosity and to each other within the same scope. To gain a higher definition understanding of each disposition, and especially generosity, we will now look at them side by side and in more detail.\n\n**(i) Generosity:** Aristotle, first and foremost, defines the generous as those who know how to give “the right amount of money to the right people at the right time” and who are disposed to do that “with pleasure, or at least without pain.”\n\nSuch a definition precludes blind or random charity. It points to a systematised approach to sharing and to those generous as possessing certain experience and knowledge in benefiting others. We may say that generous people subscribe to a clear and practical vision of what good they want to achieve and what it takes to achieve it. This also implies that they actively partake in communal matters and have intimate knowledge of the various problems and challenges that arise both in particular cases and in the community overall. To provide just a few examples, a person may instantiate their generosity through contributions towards (i) merit-based scholarships for young people who are driven and have potential but lack means, (ii) the building or repair of communal amenities such as roads and waterworks, or (iii) the relief of those who met unforeseen disaster. (e.g. war, floods, fires e.t.c)\n\nWe understand, of course, that for someone to be in a position to give away money, they must have a measure of wealth in the first place. To this effect, Aristotle underlines that a generous person is cautious not to compromise their own wellbeing by giving beyond what they can afford. With that said, they do not feel any inclination to engage in sordid dealings of any kind, however profitable, for the ultimate object of their desire and attention is not money but the welfare of their community.\n\n**(ii) Extravagance:** The extravagant are disposed to live beyond their means. Aristotle explains further that they maintain neither a proper measure to their spending nor a proper approach. With this criteria in mind, we may call someone extravagant in any number of cases. In particular, we may call extravagant those who:\n\n* naively engage in haphazard money arrangements (e.g. “honey, I just took all our savings and invested it in a Kazakhstani tupperware start-up.”)\n* let some form of addiction get the better of them financially (e.g. “Bill blew his inheritance on gambling and drugs.”)\n* conjure a spectacle of luxuriousness they cannot afford (e.g. “Hello grandma! Yeah, it’s Tim. I need you to lend me money so I can cover my monthly Tesla payment.”)\n* waste money on various species of lackeys, flatterers and pleasers (e.g. “Ben gifted a brand new luxury car to an escort.”\n* some combination of the above\n\nNo matter how extravagant someone is or in what way, Aristotle states that we can still help them improve their ways if they are willing to listen. In absence of that, however, and provided the circumstances appear, such a person might compromise their character further by engaging in sordid dealings to prop up their spending habits.\n\n**(iii) Miserliness:** Money is a miser’s god and hoarding it the noblest possible activity. We typically perceive such people as crooks and more often than not they are exactly crooks. For we call misers either (i) those who go to great lengths to not give away one penny when their immediate personal gain is not concerned, or (ii) those who greedily take every cent they can without considering the wellbeing of others, the source of the money, their own reputation.\n\nMisers venerate money and hold it as an object worthy of love and admiration. They think money has value in itself. They are somehow blind to the fact that money gains its value only insofar as a community willingly holds it as a standard of exchange of goods and services. In today’s terms, we may characterise such a person as a money fetishist. Their mind is only occupied with matters of money. Their view of the world is so twisted that they think that money makes the world go around.\n\nThey remind of a farmer who found a fruit bearing tree and eagerly gathered the fruit in sacks for himself but never bothered to water the tree, to fertilise it, to prune it, to protect it from disease. The next year he returned to gather more fruit, yet he bitterly noted that the harvest was small and did not taste good. He started shouting at the tree that it was “lazy” and should “pull itself up by its bootstraps.”\n\nAristotle states that the miser misses the mark of virtue by a far greater distance than the extravagant man. Misers are thus more greatly opposed to those generous than the extravagant.\n\n**Chapter 2 - On Magnificence**\n\n(**a) The scope of magnificence:** Aristotle moves on to magnificence. Both generosity and magnificence are character dispositions towards wealth. To this extent, the two virtues are related. They do not exactly map onto each other, however. Given that we have a fair grasp of what generosity is, let us learn more about magnificence by figuring out in which manner it is distinct to generosity.\n\n***How is magnificence distinct to generosity?*** Generosity concerns itself with how people give and take money in general and regardless of the sums involved. Magnificence specifically considers the manner people of great wealth sponsor their community. We may talk of how they provide for its defence or fund its religious functions and events. We deal here only with large sums. To put this in other words, a magnificent person is definitely generous but a generous person can only be magnificent if they also possess great wealth.\n\nWe note here that the ancient Greeks held the belief that only the wealthy could afford to venerate the gods and sacrifice to them, at least on behalf of a city. In this way, all wealthy men were expected to task themselves with the funding and organisation of all the religious ceremonies and events which took place each year. Among such events we count athletic competitions such as the Olympic Games or dramatic festivals such as the Dionysia where the famous playwrights Aeschylus, Sophocles, Eurypides competed against others. This is the historical and cultural context in which Aristotle participates and from which he derives magnificence as a virtue.\n\n***What is then the scope of magnificence?*** Magnificence is the virtuous disposition wealthy persons may demonstrate when they contribute towards the public good, i.e. act as patrons of their community. As patrons they may e.g. sponsor religious events and ceremonies, fund the building and maintenance of city infrastructure, help with the organisation of the military, among other things.\n\n(**b) Magnificence as the mean between two extremes:** So far, we have reached an understanding of the scope of magnificence. To do this, we first compared it to generosity and then considered the cultural and historical background from which magnificence proceeds.\n\nTo further refine our grasp of this concept, we now consider its position on Aristotle’s schema of the virtuous mean, identify the dispositions which stand for excess and deficiency, and place all three dispositions side by side to discuss them.\n\n***How does magnificence fit in Aristotle’s schema?*** Magnificence is the mean. It is the virtue of someone wealthy who knows how to use money to bring about great things. Now, on the side of excess we find gaudiness. We call a person gaudy when they combine being a pretentious show-off with lacking any sense of taste or proportion. Meanwhile, on the side of deficiency we locate niggardliness. The niggardly we identify as someone who always tries to give the bare minimum and always complains about giving too much.\n\nLet us now consider the three dispositions more closely:\n\n**(i) Magnificence:** Like painters bring brush to canvas and sculptors set chisel against marble, so do those magnificent know to use their wealth to bring about greatness and beauty and inspire wonder in their people’s eyes. It is for this reason that Aristotle says that those disposed to magnificence are like artists.\n\nTo be magnificent we have to be attuned to the constantly changing challenges and needs that our community faces and know what actionable steps to take to meet such challenges and needs. We have to be able to distinguish new and emerging trends and ideas in people’s minds and be capable of encouraging and establishing trends towards good destinations, starving out all the trends which lead to no good in the process.\n\n**Magnificent humans** are not mere wealthy persons, they are celebrated personalities. Children look up to them. They get to speak for their entire community. They are not merely generous, they **are like a river to their people**.\n\n**(ii) Gaudiness:** Like the magnificent, those we describe as gaudy have no problem with putting their wealth to use. Unlike the magnificent, however, the gaudy are completely out of touch with their community. They rather use luxuriousness as a tool to reinforce the distance in status between them and everyone else. They want to make sure that everyone knows that they stand above everyone else and in this way weaponise their wealth to antagonise everyone. A good example would be the anecdote of that man who launched himself in space while his slaves were not even allowed proper bathroom breaks.\n\n**(iii) Niggardliness:** We deal here with the miser written large. Even as they possess overwhelming amounts of wealth, they are still stuck compulsively collecting money. To the needs and challenges of their community, they react with their doctrine of “money for money’s sake” and “money above all”, i.e. with a theology of money. We deal here with petty crooks devoid of self-respect. Wherever they can, they go around causing difficulties and complications to avoid giving their fair share. They have no qualms about raising a great fuss to save a few cents. Whatever trifle they did give, they will keep reminding everyone about it and make it appear as though they parted with a great fortune. Such is the disposition of the niggardly person\n\nHere I end my accounts on Aristotelian generosity, magnificence and the dispositions related to them.\n\n***Would you like to read more of my work?

        "text": "We come into the next decade with Flannery O’Connor’s “Everything That Rises Must Converge” (1962). I’m really enjoying the Southern gothic stories in this anthology - the sub genre is really dynamic and utilizes symbolism in a rich way. \n\nThe story follows recent college graduate Julian and his tense relationship with his mother. Julian represents new ideas, disillusionment with the past, and the desire to break free of the “old ways”. His mother, Mrs. Chestny, represents the opposite: she is obsessed with lineage, with social graces and is struggling to adapt to the newly desegregated world she finds herself part of. \n\nJulian begrudgingly accompanies his mother to the local YMCA for a weight loss meeting; she does not want to ride the bus alone now that it has been desegregated. Julian despises her new hat, her outlook, and her presence. While riding the bus, an African American woman and her young child board. Mrs. Chestny pays attention to the child, which causes the child’s mother to start to become quietly enraged. She is also wearing the same hat as Julian’s mother, a really nice representation of how the two women are now on equal footing: they can sit anywhere they like on the bus, they can shop at the same stores, and they can have the same taste in fashion. \n\nMrs. Chestny tries to give the young boy a penny, which to her seems like an act of kindness, but to the child’s mother is an act of disrespect. The child’s mother hits Mrs. Chestny with her purse and tells her to keep her penny. Julian is filled with righteous rage at his mother’s actions and her lack of social awareness - until she falls dead in the street from the blow. It’s not until things have progressed too far for any of the characters to realize their commitment to their own viewpoints and inflexibility is wrong. \n\nQuotable: “The tide of darkness seemed to sweep him back to her, postponing from moment to moment his entry into the world of guilt and sorrow”.",

In this allegorical work, the main character is Ozzie, a thirteen-year-old Jewish boy who struggles with some of the dogma of the Jewish tradition. Of specific concern is the Christian concept of the immaculate conception. \n\nThe rabbi teaches that while Christ was a historical figure, a mortal man, he was only that, and that anyone who thinks differently cannot consider themselves Jewish. Ozzie rebels against this idea - God created the world and light - knowing that, a virgin birth hardly seems difficult to accomplish. Ozzie’s questions are met with resistance from his rabbi and even results in a slap from his mother - so Ozzie becomes Christ. \n\nAfter an argument with the rabbi, Ozzie locks himself on the roof of the synagogue, removing himself from his friends and teacher (Christ’s death). The rabbi and his mother beg him to come down, the other students encourage him to jump. Ozzie then has everyone at the synagogue, including a devout janitor, assume a kneeling position (as Christians do) and state that God is omnipotent and therefore a virgin birth is possible and Jesus is the son of God. He makes the crowd recite a sort of prayer that translates to “do not harm in the name of god”. Once the “conversion” has been accomplished, Ozzie jumps off the roof, but onto the safety of a firefighter’s net, thus completing the Christ allegory by “returning” to Earth.  \n\nThere is much more to this story and it is full of symbolism - definitely one to read over more than once. \n\nQuotable: “‘Now I can come down…’ And he did, right into the center of the yellow net that flowed in the evening’s edge like an overgrown halo”.",

But as the author it is a \"trial and error.\" \n\nMeanwhile, with Soccer players I noticed the audience connects with them right away. They give them nicknames. They are interested in who they are dating and where they did they grow up. \n\nThe Argentinian team is one of the best examples. Both Julian and Enzo we've only just met them. We mostly seem them in a few games. Yet it feels we've known them forever.  It also seems like they are part of a big family a big ensemble cast.

        "text": "I'm an undergrad in my third year completing an degree in English, but recently its come to my attention that whenever I contribute to discussion, it seems as if nobody in my classroom understands what I'm talking about. Some of the other students will contribute, but I always find that their arguments are trite and not only lacking in content but also lacking in verbiage. Yet they would be met with a chorus of hums and excessive nodding.\n\nBefore I get to the moment which spurred this tirade, I'd like to say I am completely enamored with the school of \"New Criticism\". There is something romantic about it, the purest form of criticism that paradoxically dismisses the author while preserving the sanctity of his work. Moreover I am completely bored by Marxist and Feminist criticism. I think that is because the answer is always the same. I go into a book knowing exactly what I'm looking for. Oh this element means alienation, this symbol represents the bourgeois. Feminist writing admittedly has more originality in its presentation, but likewise it is always the same story. I will not speak ill of Derrida or Saussure, as I am lifetimes away from understanding their theory. \n\nSo the contribution at hand. We were discussing *Alias Grace* the work of female Canadian icon Margaret Atwood. In a stroke of genius, I noticed the relevance of the symbol of quilting patterns in the narrative. Atwood plays with a complex narrative coming from many perspectives, each character casts a different judgement and opinion on the incarceration of the main character, Grace Marks.\n\nGrace herself is a talented seamstress, and when probed for her favorite quilting pattern she notes that it is the tree of paradise. This is a reference to the tree of **knowledge** in the garden of Eden, which is not only constantly referenced in the book multiple times, it is reflective of Grace's crime (she allegedly convinces a man to murder another woman).\n\nEach quilt tells a story, this is the reason why every part of the novel is named after a specific quilting pattern, and paired with an illustration. I theorized that Grace says that she wishes to sow the \"tree of paradise\" because she wants to tell her own version of her story. She is constantly misrepresented by those around her. We can see an example of this in the governor's wife—who keeps around Grace like a pet. She keeps a scrapbook of Grace's crime, and shows it to her friends. She scares them with this story, but presents a scary, false image of Grace. This links to a moment where Grace looks at a piece which the Governor's wife has sown, framed on the wall. A simple collage of fruits, she notes that it is not very good and disapproves of it, noting how she could do much better. The Governor's wife's work symbolizes the butchered story of grace that she tells her visitors.\n\nGrace has been falsely accused, and misunderstood for years. Her desire to quilt the \"tree of paradise\" is congruent to her desire to have her story told proper. I theorized that the end of the book would have her doing as such.\n\nThen radio silence from the class. Can you tell me if I am talking out of my ass or if its my classmates that are talentless hacks.",

With a clear conscience I tell you, as before God, who beholds me, that I despise freedom and life and health, and all that in your books is called the good things of the world. \n       “For fifteen years I have been intently studying earthly life. It is true I have not seen the earth nor men, but in your books I have drunk fragrant wine, I have sung songs, I have hunted stags and wild boars in the forests, have loved women.... Beauties as ethereal as clouds, created by the magic of your poets and geniuses, have visited me at night, and have whispered in my ears wonderful tales that have set my brain in a whirl. In your books I have climbed to the peaks of Elburz and Mont Blanc, and from there I have seen the sun rise and have watched it at evening flood the sky, the ocean, and the mountain-tops with gold and crimson. I have watched from there the lightning flashing over my head and cleaving the storm-clouds. I have seen green forests, fields, rivers, lakes, towns. I have heard the singing of the sirens, and the strains of the shepherds’ pipes; I have touched the wings of comely devils who flew down to converse with me of God.... In your books I have flung myself into the bottomless pit, performed miracles, slain, burned towns, preached new religions, conquered whole kingdoms.... \n       “Your books have given me wisdom. All that the unresting thought of man has created in the ages is compressed into a small compass in my brain. I know that I am wiser than all of you. \n       “And I despise your books, I despise wisdom and the blessings of this world. It is all worthless, fleeting, illusory, and deceptive, like a mirage. You may be proud, wise, and fine, but death will wipe you off the face of the earth as though you were no more than mice burrowing under the floor, and your posterity, your history, your immortal geniuses will burn or freeze together with the earthly globe. \n       “You have lost your reason and taken the wrong path. You have taken lies for truth, and hideousness for beauty. You would marvel if, owing to strange events of some sorts, frogs and lizards suddenly grew on apple and orange trees instead of fruit, or if roses began to smell like a sweating horse; so I marvel at you who exchange heaven for earth. I don’t want to understand you. \n       “To prove to you in action how I despise all that you live by, I renounce the two millions of which I once dreamed as of paradise and which now I despise. To deprive myself of the right to the money I shall go out from here five hours before the time fixed, and so break the compact....”",

However, inspite of being a sorry, pathetic person, I couldn't help but feel extremely bad for him. And this mostly comes from the fact that I feel like I share a lot of similarities with him (as I imagine a lot of people who read this book do) and in a way reading this book has strangely been a sort of way to pity myself.\n\nI felt as though certain traits or aspects of The Underground Man is necessary to live a meaningful life: a willingness to look inwardly and criticise without flinching, to able to look beyond material possessions and societal standards, to not delude yourself with lofty nonsense such as utopias, etc. But what The Underground Man does wrong is that he's a very cynical person. He sees nothing good in himself and assumes that everyone else must also be just as awful as him and he thinks this way in order to lift himself up. He assumes that the highest form a human being can reach is HIS form and never thinks to break out of his nasty ways since he believes his nastiness comes from a place of superiority. He constantly denies that he thinks that he's better than anyone else, but I can tell you from personal experience that this is 100% a lie and is simply a way to hide his ego. The Underground Man is without doubt a very conscious person, maybe even more conscious than most people, but he's still all too human and there are still parts of him deep down that he refuses to acknowledge, his unquenchable desire to have positive human connections being one of those things.\n\nMost people read the ending of the book as depressing. I understand why and perhaps I'm cooking up conclusions out of thin air but I'd like to believe that The Underground Man at the end of the book does eventually crawl out of The Underground and realises the errors of his 24 year old self. In the end, he says he's no longer going to write about anything from The Underground, but Dostoevsky writes that The Underground Man never stopped writing his so called Notes. So maybe he escaped his nasty old ways and started to write about better things and how he became better? I don't know, that's what I'd like to believe anyway. I look forward to hearing what everyone else in this sub thinks of this book. Let me know in the comments.",
