        "text": "A young man took every penny he had and used it to open an aquarium. He worked tirelessly, growing it from a small roadside attraction into the greatest aquarium ever. He amassed the largest collection of sea life ever assembled. He and his team conducted scientific research and ran breeding programs that helped restock populations of endangered species. His teams rehabilitated thousands of injured animals every year. He helped lobby for legislation to protect the oceans and marine habitats. He designed and built the most humane and realistic animal enclosures. He spared no expense in creating innovative and educational exhibits and displays.\n\nAnd then suddenly, laws were passed that outlawed keeping marine mammals. His aquarium had to get rid of all of its best and most loved animal exhibits. No more whales. No more narwhals. No more walruses.\n\nThe crowds no longer came, and the aquarium started losing money. The man became despondent at how the thing he poured his heart and soul into had begun to crumble. Soon after, he died of a broken heart.\n\nAt the funeral, the mourners all spoke about how he died because he had lost the thing he truly loved: his porpoise.",

However because of what you did, I will also give twice what you wish for to the person you hate the most: your boss.\"\n\nSo the man agreed and made his first wish. \"I want lots of money\", he said. Instantly 22 million dollars appear in the man's bank account and 44 million appeared in his boss' account.\n\nFor his second wish, the man wished for a couple of sports cars. Instantly a Lambergini, Ferrari and a Porsche appeared, but at the same time outside his boss' house appeared two of each car.\n\nFinally the genie said, \"This is your last wish, you should choose carefully\", and so the man replied, \"I've always wanted to donate a kidney...\"",

        "text": "When I was 10 until I was 13, I spent my summers staying on my Auntie and Uncle's farm. My mom said it was to \"build character\" but really its because I was out of school and she was a single mother and had to work. Auntie and Uncle were not physically abusive but did tell me I was \"trash\" and all sorts of nasty names all the time. The worst thing for me at the time was they had me choring for pretty much all and if they thought that I was thinking about doing something wrong they would punish me in the worst way I could think of at the time, as a growing boy, bed without supper.\n\nOne Saturday Uncle came home from the race track with a full blown horse. He was saying crazy stuff like \"we're gunna get a $10,000 stud fee.\" Their farm didn't have animals except a few chickens, nothing that could be a suitable stable. So Uncle made a tiny pen in front of the farm house for the horse until the \"warehouse stable could be dropped off.\" Surprisingly Auntie was okay with this probably because Uncle let her name it. Auntie thought she was the smartest cutest woman in the world because she came up with the name \"Dirty\" for the brown horse and she told everyone it was brilliant. Worse part for me at the time is if they thought I was looking at the horse too much and wanted to ride it, they would send me to bed without supper, and they decided to add feeding and brushing it to my list of chores.\n\nOne afternoon a few weeks later, between choring times, I was playing in the front yard with a giant tractor tire. They let me play with it because it had a slash in it and there's literally nothing else to do on the farm. Uncle was on the front porch doing paperwork and watching me in the yard. Eventually he goes inside but he or Auntie would stick their heads out just to make sure I wasn't near the horse pen. So I'm pushing this tire and I'm jumping though the middle. At some point my foot gets caught and I fall inside. I'm a little close to the hill and the tire starts speeding up down it. I'm stuck in the tire going head over foot down this hill. Auntie must have saw me and she get out on the porch and starts screaming. Uncle then comes out and starts screaming at me like I did something wrong. They see me rolling. They hatin'. Patrolling. Trying to catch me riding Dirty.\n\nShamelessly stolen from a 4chan greentext.",

        "text": "He didn't even remember how he got home from the party. As bad as he was feeling, he wondered if he did something wrong.\n\nJack had to force himself to open his eyes, and the first thing he saw was a couple of aspirins next to a glass of water on the side table. And, next to them, a single red rose! Jack sat up and saw his clothing in front of him, all clean and pressed. He looked around the room and saw that it was in perfect order, spotlessly clean. So was the rest of the house.\n\nHe took the aspirins, and cringed when he saw a huge black eye staring back at him in the bathroom mirror. Then he noticed a note hanging on the corner of the mirror written in red with little hearts on it and a kiss mark from his wife in lipstick: \"Honey, breakfast is on the stove. I left early to get groceries to make you your favourite dinner tonight. I love you, darling!\" He stumbled to the kitchen and sure enough, there was hot breakfast, steaming hot coffee and the morning newspaper. His son was also at the table, eating. Jack asked, \"Son, what happened last night?\" \"Well, you came home after 3 A.M, drunk and out of your mind. You fell over the coffee table and broke it, and then you puked in the hallway, and got that black eye when you ran into the door.\" Confused, he asked his son, \"So, why is everything in such perfect order and so clean? I have a rose, and breakfast is on the table waiting for me??\"\n\nHis son replied, \"Oh THAT! Mum dragged you to the bathroom to clean you up, and when she tried to take your pants off, you screamed, 'Leave me alone bitch, I'm married!'\"",
