        "text": " I intend on design and build a McKibben hydraulic muscle that can lift 5 tons by itself, it won't be attached to a human or anything like that.\n\nI tried to search for methods to calculate the amount of force and pressures required for this type of soft actuator, but it seems these equations are too complex for me, because I couldn't get results besides error messages on the calculators.\n\n\\---------\n\nI have the intention to build it with the following specifications:\n\n* The amount of pressure inside the artificial muscles will range from 0.4 MPa to 1 MPa.\n* The length I intend to make it 30 cm long, I do not know which will be the actuated length.\n* I do not know the diameter/radius, nor the actuated diameter and radius.\n* The inner bladder and the outer expandable sleeve are meant to be made of Aramid fabric and fibers.\n* Both connections in both ends of the soft actuator are meant to be made out of steel.\n* The hydraulic fluid will be conventional hydraulic oil with a density of 0.9 g/ml.\n\n\\----------\n\nI tried the equations on [this article on researchgate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/330193236_An_analytical_formula_for_designing_McKibben_pneumatic_muscles), but I only got negative numbers.\n\nExample:\n\n((π(4.97))²(100 ÷ 4 (sin(45))²))(3(1 - 0.11 ÷ 24)² cos(45)²2 - 1)\n\n\\-4412.77987695\n\n\\----------\n\nI got some people saying (in other websites) that I should use the \"FPA triangle equation\" (the F = P x A or P = F ÷ A), but that are meant for solid hydraulic cylinders. I don't think it would apply for McKibben cylinders, though.\n\nBasically, depending on what number you want to find (Force, Pressure or Area), you can use the equations \"F = P x A\" or \"A = F ÷ P\".\n\nThe **problem** is that it is a equation meant for **hydraulic solid cylinders**, **not membrane actuators**.\n\nBut I tried to use the area of the entire membrane, so I thought i could somewhat calculate the force it will apply.\n\nAccordingly to [this cylinder area calculator](https://www.calculatorsoup.com/calculators/geometry-solids/cylinder.php), if I have a cylinder with 10cm radius and 30cm long, I will have a total area of 2513 cm2 (389.6 in²) applying 60 PSI (0,4 MPa), so I would have a force of 23340 pounds (10586,846 kg).\n\n* If it was 5cm radius 30cm length, I would have 1099cm² (170.3 in²).\n* F = P x A\n* 10200 pounds (4626,6422 kg).\n\nThis is the force applied to the **area**, but the area is the **membrane**, right? How to translate it to **lifting force**?​",

I chose this major because I am interested in working with and designing electronics, problem solving, working with circuits, computers, etc. I am currently contemplating on switching my major to mechanical engineering. Electrical and Mechanical have always been my top 2 choices that I couldn’t decide between. But the reason is because I really would like to be hands on with a lot of the stuff I do. \n\nAnd Ik that both M/E and E/E can be hands on but from my research it always seemed obvious that M/E was a lot more hands on than E/E. I also know that both can involve sitting down and designing things, make prototypes, and sketching/building designs on a screen or paper but it just seems like E/E involves more designing and less hands on building rather than having some designing and some hands on like M/E. I understand that regardless of what I chose, there will be some sitting down a designing involved and I’m ok with that, I just don’t want to do that nearly all the time and rarely do any hands on work.\n\nRight now I am currently taking my pre-req classes that both M/E and E/E would require so if I were to switch it shouldn’t be an issue. My college has both majors",

        "text": "Take an unbalanced rotor - centre of gravity off-centre from rotational axis - upon which a constant torque is appled. Rotor is connected by two bearings to stator, at the extreme ends of the rotor shaft. Stator fixed in place. Unbalanced mass comes from a disc on one end of the rotor, past the bearing. Imagine spinning an umbrella about two bearings along the handle. But top of umbrella has some added mass on one side.\n\nTorque will act to accelerate the rotation of the rotor (from 0). Unbalanced mass eventually creates a wobble or precession as it speeds up. However, the shaft will still speed up. The unbalanced mass creates this precession but does not hinder the shaft's ability to accelerate under the influence of the torque applied. \n\nThis is where we disagree. Colleague thinks the rotor will hit a max speed. What is the mechanism that could balance the torque applied? To me it is simple F=ma. We have an 'F', we get an 'a'. \n\nOnly thing I can consider is that the stator deforms/wobbles as the precession is induced and now bearing and torque misalign. If we take components of torque we still have a component parallel to axis of the bearing, at which there is ideally no rotational stiffness/damping and therefore rotor should continue to accelerate.\n\nAnyone with experience in the field of rotating machines or otherwise able to confirm or challenge the above?

My idea, physical or optical switch opens as the train physically passes it, and closes when the train is no longer there. Switch engaged, door goes up. Train leaves, door comes down. No line up nessesary. Electrical for the train is track level, not ceiling. \n\nIf needed, we could also set the whole lot to go on staggered timing so you can never fall in front of the train, or, have it all raise when the train fully enters the station. \n\nThis seems obvious, cheap and effective, so why won't it work?",

        "text": " Hello everyone, I am a mechanical engineering PhD student entering my last year before finishing and I'm thinking of filing a patent for either a method I developed, a linked product or both via my university (Europe). Both aspects are promising and might have market value, but evidently the university will be patent holder since I am employed and paid by them. So after finishing, if I were to create a startup and continue working on this, I would have to license this stuff from them. Whether this would be an exclusive license or not is so far unknown to me.\n\nNow there is of course the significant possibility that someone already covered this before and the train of thought leads to nowhere. For the sake of discussion, let's say it's still up for grabs. Do I even benefit from creating a patent for my employer, apart from having a neat entry on my CV? I intentionally did not pose more specific questions as to not guide the discussion to much. Please let me know your thoughts about this or any similar situation.",

I'm trying to calculate the minimum wall thickness for the vessel that the wood chips will be compacted into. I made the attached diagram to help me think through this conundrum. The diagram shows hydraulic Cylinder A with a bore of 2.5in and a max extension pressure of 3000 psi. This should result in 14,718 lbf applied to Cylinder B which has a 1in bore. I think I'm right in saying that if Cylinder B was sealed and contained hydraulic oil, when A maxed out the internal pressure of Cylinder B would be 18,749psi (14,718 / .785  area of 1in bore).\n\nBut if Cylinder B isn't sealed and is just like a shot glass with straight sides that receives a 1in diameter plunger, assuming that Cylinder A maxes out, will the internal pressure of vessel B still reach 18,749psi?  And would that be the value that I'd plug into Barlow's Formula for internal pressure to calculate my wall thickness? (Just FYI, I'm not using shot glasses ;) , I'm milling the vessels from 4140 steel)  \n\nIt seems like under enough pressure the sawdust and woodchips would behave like a fluid and the pressure calculations would be the same. But if I take it to an extreme and say the vessel has no sides it's just a flat plan, then it seems like the compaction force would be 14,718 and there would be no internal pressure because it's not sealed. \n\nThanks for your help! \n\n[https://i.imgur.com/vNzmiS0.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/vNzmiS0.jpg)",

What I would like to do is to take that 10 in diameter and redistributed in an octopus shape with many legs and smaller holes. Is there a formula I could use or how do I go about determining where I'm not restricting the airflow and I don't have the holes so large that I'm losing the pressure? In a perfect world I would like to extend one hose a 4-in diameter 100 ft and then have a series of three quarter inch holes along the length blowing dry air and have the pressure even throughout or even similar would be acceptable.

It's a recording of a silent audience in a concert hall. I turned the volume up pretty high so we could hear all the small noises from the audience.\n\nI was explaining how this song is played in front of audiences sometimes and then everyone will clap when it's done. I started applauding when explained this and then heard clapping sounds coming from the recording but I knew it didn't have any. Anytime I would clap my hands, the audio system would also play a clap sound a moment later.\n\nMy friend thought I was messing with her but I assured her I wasn't. I tried making other loud noises but it didn't copy those. The clapping sound was the only sound this happened with.\n\nI told her it probably had to do with the car's amplifier being turned up so high which was causing some kind of weird feedback within the audio system with loud high-frequency sounds like those from a clap. The music was being played from an iPhone connected to the car via a series of cables connected together (a mix of Apple Lightning and Apple 30-pin cables). I thought the clapping might be interacting with the janky cable setup somehow but I'm not sure if this is the case as they carry a digital rather than analog signal (although I don't know how this works).\n\nIt might be interacting directly with the car's audio system somehow but again, I don't really know how this all works. I did some electronics and signal processing courses in university but not enough to know exactly what was causing this.\n\nI'm super curious why this happened though and would love an explanation! I didn't have time to isolate what part of the system was causing this (e.g. determining if this happened only with the phone playing music or with any quiet audio played on the audio system) but I hope this gives enough info.",

It is so much easier to use a hydraulic jack compared to one that uses gears/screwing although the total energy to lift a car a particular height should remain the same.\n\nOr pneumatic impact drivers: so much more powerful than their battery-driven electric counterparts. But why?\n\nRecently I've seen a hydraulic gear puller which I totally don't understand, why is using a hydraulic cylinder for this purpose useful?\n\nThe only reason I can come up with is that the compressed air/hydraulic fluid is just a means to transfer energy where you can have a much larger unit that actually creates that energy somewhere else (e.g., air compressor that is large but doesn't need to be right at the shaft, obviously).

I mean round culverts in the range of Ø0-100 cm, being built under a forest road so the surface water would get to the other side. [The forest is a pine forest and soil is mostly average sand.](https://imgur.com/a/SGvl2gd)  \nWhat is the mechanism how culverts get clogged up? Is sediment the main factor, or twigs and leaves?  \nWould a Ø30 cm culvert get jammed more easily that a Ø50 cm culvert?  \n\n\nMy problem: I've designed a Ø20 cm culvert under my road (amount of water is negligible). Another person tells me to change it to a Ø30 cm one so it wouldn't get jammed. But he can't explain his reasoning.  \n\n\nThank you!",

Then I think I would need a more powerful motor, so I'm not sure if the whole thing would work out. The only problem is that I have very little engineering knowledge, so how the hell would I go about doing this haha.\nThanks in advance!",

Additionally, I would like to avoid the use of screws to shorten assembly time and because it is a tight squeeze where the handle attaches to the base making it hard to screw it in.

The holder itself is attached rigidly to the casing itself. The details of the holder are the standard ones for AA batteries or similar.\n\nThe question is how can the design of the battery holder avoid (or lower substantially) the chance that the electrical contact could be lost?
