So instead of picking my classes and eventually choosing a major I start my degree with my equivalent of a major already chosen. This also means I have a set of classes that are compulsory with only a few extra credits for me to choose whatever else I want to take. So I can't really do any equivalent of minoring in maths as I have to choose straight away since it will affect which classes I have to take.",

I am just fooling around to try to learn as much as I can about web development. Any server-side programming is one of the most important, if not the most important aspects to this. Most people usually go with ASP or PHP but I was like nah, I want to be different. I figured out it is possible to use Python (via CGI) :D! Let me get down to the issue. I was looking for a way to update a page without reloading it. That's where Ajax comes in. Ajax is super compatible with ASP and PHP but I don't want to take that route. Now I know there is some stuff that helps Python work with Ajax friendlier like jQuery and Flask and stuff, but I am looking for the simplest demonstration of just pure Python to Ajax (if even possible). I am starting to think it is not because I looked everywhere. Anyway, here is a JavaScript of very simple Ajax in action:\n\"function loadDoc()\n{\nvar xhttp = new XMLHttpRequest();\n\nxhttp.onreadystatechange = function()\n{\nif (xhttp.readyState == 4 &amp;&amp; xhttp.status == 200)\n{\ndocument.getElementById(\"result\").innerHTML = xhttp.responseText;\n}\n};\n\nxhttp.open(\"GET\",\"examp.txt\",true);\nxhttp.send();\n}\"\n\nNow without complicating the above script too much, is there a way to pass, say a string, to a python program? And if so, what would be the simplest way  to just return that string and thus printing out to the element identified by 'result' (if that is also possible?\n\nIt would be very helpful and appreciated if you are able to show some example code, but if you don't feel up to it then explaining is fine too.\n\nThank You in advance everyone!!!! :D\n\n",

Open water is indicated by an O, incorrect guesses by an X, and battleships by an asterisk (*). \nTask \n1. Start by building your game board. This is a 5 x 5 two-dimensional char array. Initialize the board to store O’s for the open water, then print the board. Your board would look a bit like this: \n\n2. Create a Location class with only 2 instance variables (attributes/fields), row and column. Add getters and setters for both and a constructor that accepts the row and column values as arguments and assigns them appropriately. This class will store locations of your battleships. \n3. Create an ArrayList capable of storing Location objects. Get a random location for three battleships, create corresponding Location objects, and append these objects to the ArrayList. \n4. The user gets 6 attempts to guess where your battleships are. For each attempt: \na. Tell them how many attempts and battleships remain \nb. Allow the user to make a guess \ni. Check their guess against the boundaries of the board, if it is outside the boundaries, display an appropriate message \nii. Check the guess against cells already marked with an asterisk (*) or an X (indicating a miss or battleship), display a message to tell the user that they’ve already guessed that location \niii. Check the guess against all the battleship locations in the ArrayList. If they guess correctly, remove the location from the ArrayList, mark the location on the board with an asterisk (*), and display an appropriate message. \niv. Otherwise, mark the guessed location with an X and display a message telling the user that they’ve missed your battleship \nc. Print the board \nd. Decrement the number of turns \n5. After all guesses have been made, if there are still battleships remaining, mark all of them on the board with an asterisk (*), display a message stating that the game is over, print the board \n\nTest your game! Make sure correct and incorrect guesses work properly according to the above. \n",

I am taking a AP Computer Science class as my high school, but as the class is taught to the test, both the AP class/test is new, and the teacher is new to CS as well I feel, while I will probably enjoy the class, I will not get the tools and experiences I all looking for.\n\nI was wondering if there were any online resources such as websites, books, and seminars (preferably free) that could be recommend to really get into the field.",

I Hash the file, and I get a short series of digits and letters (40 long? does that sound right?), which should be unique to the file.  Move a single colon, or change a digit by a value of 1, and we will get a huge variation in the Hashes.  this sound right?  \n  \nMy question is: how can the Hash be guarenteed to be unique when there are so few variables in the Hash compared to the file.    \n  \nIf the Hash is 40 characters long, and the file contains thousands of characters, and they have more or less the same set of character available to them - how do we get unique Hashes?    \n  \n(i know that, under controlled conditions, someone managed to get a 'collision' (same hash for different files) using either MD5 or SHA1, but my course suggests that SHA2 doesn't have this problem :S how? :S )",

Like, for an extremely simple example, say you have a file that is\n\n    1010101011110001011010010101\n\ncouldn't you just have a 'compressed' version of the file be an equation that results in that binary number, thus producing the original file?\n\nMy assumption is that the equation required to produce the file's binary would be larger than the original file itself, but I was just curious.",

One question in my most recent quiz for school is as follows:\n\nThe read, write, and execute permissions of a file are an example of a:\nA. discretionary access control\nB. firewall control\nC. mandatory access control \nD. system kernel control\n\nThe quiz result says that the answer is DAC, but I don’t think there is enough detail in the question to arrive at this answer. I think Firewall control is clearly not the answer, and kernel is probably not correct either. However, DAC and MAC seem to be equally correct. I understand that usually you have to choose the most correct of the correct answers, but there just isn’t enough detail in the question to differentiate between MAC or DAC in this case. If the question included a statement as to HOW the permissions were granted, this probably wouldn’t be in question, but it doesn’t.\n\nCorrect me if I’m wrong, but the “read, write, and execute” part of the question are essentially useless to the answer in this case. It’s just fluff. Said in another way, the questions could have just said, “permissions of a file are an example of a ____”. When the question is broken down like this, how does DAC take priority over MAC as a correct answer???? Thank you for any insight. I want to learn!!!",

Get the raw image from a digitalPersona sensor. [image](http://imgur.com/tWhAXEp)\n\n2. Binarize it. [image](http://imgur.com/1mEU1w0)\n\n3. Skeletonize it. I used Hall's algorithm because that is the only one I got to work more or less properly. You can still see some flaws. [image](http://imgur.com/SxzDd1q)\n\n4. Strip the convex hull (inverted Jarvis algorithm) and get all the ridge endings as an array of (i, j) coordinates (points with one neighbour only). I also have a script to get the bifurcations (3 neighbours). [representation of ridge endings only](http://imgur.com/Jt5TVab)\n\n**What I need :** knowing that I can get these so-called minutiae (ridge endings and also bifurcations, which are not represented on the image) and also a direction for each point (e.g. direction of ridge for the ridge ending), how do I match two sets of minutiae and give a similarity score ?\n\n**Tools and languages used:** digitalParsona U.are.U 4500 scanner, fprint library on linux, C for image aquisition, Python3 with PIL for image processing.\n\n**My thoughts so far :**\n\n* I can neglect  the finger rotation for now, but I probably need to normalize the sets to compensate the (x, y) shifts between two images of the same finger.\n* Maybe I could transform the sets so that they have the same barycenter, but I don't know how well that will work.\n* I could create a matrix of intensities for each set (e.g 5 on a point, 4 around the point, etc) so as to get something that could be represented like [this but with more spikes (best image I could find right now)](http://i.stack.imgur.com/BAiSL.png) and if A minus B gives me a pretty flat surface (mathematically, that could be a low sum of squares of values in the resulting matrix) I will know that the images look alike.\n\n**How do you think I could compare to such sets ?**\n\nI tried to show you that I really did put some effort in this and am not trying to get you to do the work for me ;)\n\nIf you have any questions I'll be happy to answer them.

        "text": "I have a BSIT, but I have never worked in IT. I originally went to school industrial automation. In my senior year (I was going into the second semester of what would have been a 3 semester senior year) I ran out of money and chose to take the \"industry\" route of my program since it allowed for an entire semester internship. This meant getting paid and only having to pay for 1 class (messed up I had to pay to work...). My internship was 5 hours away from school and long story short they offered me a job as a controls engineer and a very competitive salary to stay. In my head everything would work out because out of the 6 classes I had left 3 were gen eds I had put off, 1 was continuing my internship and making a senior project out of it, one was a 300 level robotics lecture but it had previously been available at a satellite campus near me, and the other a 200 level that I found (or at least thought I found) a transfer equivalent at a nearby college. \n\nLong story less long, it all fell apart. The satellite campus closed a few months before this and to take that class as a transfer equivalent would put me under the required 300/400 level classes needed to be awarded my degree. So I ended up taking my 3 gen ed classes while pleading with the school to work with me with no luck. I thought about just going back, but giving up the money I was making to give more money to a school that wouldn't help me out (I know they didn't owe anything) when I needed it just didn't seem like a good idea. The degree was too specialized and I couldn't find a direct transfer, plus I realized over a year ago I really just wanted to be a programmer, so I started looking into starting up in CS. I ran into another snag where the college I was transferring from let me substitute classes like cultural diversity for diversity in education (an EDU class) and macro econ for psychology, all the colleges in my area weren't so flexible. I was looking at a full year (not including the semester I just took finishing humanities, communications, and sociology) of gen eds plus 2 years of CS core. It just didn't seem reasonable. I ended finding a school that took my credits by level and department rather than individual classes, but they didn't offer CS only IT. I figured it was good enough and I'd just get this damn bachelor's out of the way. \n\nSo I knocked that out and got my piece of paper. I did well, graduated with a 3.8, but I'm 25 now and have been making over $80k (10-15K in OT) for a little over 2 years. There's not way I'm going to start an entry level IT job and take a 50% pay cut. However, I'm also over having my phone ring 24 hours a day to help someone navigate an HMI or robot teach pendant. \n\nSo I'm back where I was two years ago. I want to learn CS, or more precisely I want to develop software. I'm considering starting up a Master's of Software and Information Systems program. I've had classes in Java, C, C++, Python, and a database management class where I went the extra mile and actually coded the database for our project even though it was just a theoretical project. I'm by no means particularly good at any of these languages, they felt more like intro to programming classes (with the exception of Java, that class was legit). I looked through the curriculum for the Software Engineering program and it looks like it is mostly theory. What I mean by this is I'm not confident I'm going to come out of this program with the technical skills gained from actually doing. \n\nI've been particularly drawn to the .NET framework but I'll admit I have not looked into a whole lot else. I considered The Odin Project but just like it's intended it seems from my point of view to be strictly web development. I liked that MVC could do web and app development, and that the Visual Studio and C# in it sets you up nicely for mobile app development with Xamarin. I don't really want to limit myslef to .NET, but as something to tackle that can cover desktop apps, web develpment, and mobile development it just seems like a good focus. \n\nI apologize for being so long winded and I'll get to the actual question.... \n\n\nI want to get the technical skills and knowledge to be able to code anything from desktop apps to web to mobile. Are any of these in particular the best way to go:\n\n1) Pursue a Masters in Software Engineering without a CS foundation.\n2) Get a second Bachelor's in CS now that I don't feel any pressure for not having my degree when I was so close.\n3) Self teach/learn .NET or another framework. If option 3 any recommendations on a path to take. \n\nTL;DR\nI have a BSIT with no IT experience. I have a beginners level knowledge of programming. Which of the following options above is recommended while taking into consideration my overall goal is to be able to do app and web development.",

I'm aware of cloning techniques for static websites which involve simply downloading all of the static files used, but I'm not sure how that would apply for situations like this.\n\nDoes anyone know if the server-side stuff for Kickass was just made available somewhere? Did each mirror re-implement existing functionality? Even if they did, where did they get their database from? Note, the same thing happened for thepiratebay when it got shut down, and I'm pretty sure even more recently for Torrentz.\n\nI'm at a loss here for how it was accomplished. Thanks in advance :)",
