I mean, a cobra is an \"eyeglass snake. \"Long neck deer\" for giraffe? \"Duck mouth beast\" instead of duck billed platypus?\n\nMy personal favourite, because it's just too ridiculous, but the Chinese call a hippopotamus a \"river horse\"!

        "text": "/r/German recently made a wiki for German-language resources, which in a moment of procrastination, I decided to peruse. Noticing one site was described as clarifying \"mistakes native speakers make\", I had a feeling there would be plenty of badling to find.\n\nI was correct.\n\n[This](http://www.bastiansick.de/kolumnen/zwiebelfisch) is the website. I picked a few articles that seemed to have the best badling, but honestly pretty much any article there would be nearly equally bad. Here goes:\n\nOn Emojis:\n\n[Perhaps a new stage of written language has announced itself: instead of writing boring, monotonous words, we'll write with fun and colorful little images! Then even the Japanese will be able to understand our texts!](http://www.bastiansick.de/kolumnen/zwiebelfisch/smile)\n\nOn what he perceives to be an untraditional use of modal auxiliaries: \n\n[[The ad doesn't say] \"We make Supermarket Advertisements\" or \"We are skilled with Supermarket Advertisements\", but instead \"We are supermarket advertisement!\" It makes you think of the *Bild* Newspaper [a trashy German tabloid].](http://www.bastiansick.de/kolumnen/zwiebelfisch/wir-sind-stuemmeldeutsch)\n\ncontinuing:\n\n\"In 2009, ZDF even ran a multi-part political talent show with the title, 'I can [be] Chancellor!' ... 'ZDF would probably fail on a show called 'I can [speak] German!' mocked one critic.\"\nThe irony is that he acknowledges that \"Ich kann Deutsch\" (\"I can [speak] German\", where the verb \"speak\" is omitted) is a totally valid and common construction, but somehow omitting the copula in the exact same type of construction is a great offense.\n\nFrom the same article, on why linguistic change will be the downfall of the German state:\n\n\"The Media, meanwhile, are obliged to the language in another way. At least they once were. Specifically not as indefatigable cut-chewers of presumably cheekily-humorous phrases out of advertising jargon, but as a model for a clear,straightforward, and unconvoluted language, which doesn't seize upon every which fashion, but is instead timeless. Because every imitation of a linguistic fashion is nothing more than a form of ingratiation. And ingratiation is the antithesis of sovereignty.\"\n\nHere we have a love poem lamenting the use of English loanwords, most of which are either very common in many languages (e.g. \"joggen\" from \"to jog\") or hardly ever used in German (e.g. \"das Smiling\"):\n\n[English opens many doors / and fulfills modern dreams /I can only move you in the heart / with German alone / Because no other language in the world / can express what I like so much about you / And I wouldn't say in any other language / What I feel for you: I love you](http://www.bastiansick.de/kolumnen/zwiebelfisch/keine-andere-sprache_2)\n\nThere's also this article [here](http://www.bastiansick.de/kolumnen/zwiebelfisch/politisch-voellig-unkorrekt) wherein he apparently complains that politically correct terms too often involve Anglicisms. Most of the article is devoted to \"exposing\" that Native American names chosen by the groups they represent are often derogatory themselves. Or something. I only skimmed it.\n\nEdit: formatting",
