        "author": "ctlister",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNetsec/comments/7puh8g/concerns_about_xss_in_a_reverse_engineering/",
        "text": "Hi, I have been hired to reverse engineer a web application from a competitor but i wanted to ask a few questions about **any potential XSS vulnerabilities**, particularly the Stored XSS type, that could lie in this fellow's implementation.\n\nYou see, after going through the target's code, i tried to convince my employer to \"dump copying his design and build a new ____ from scratch\". \n\nAs of right now, not 100% sure which way Boss wants me to go. But i seek to avoid using any of target's methods at all costs.\n\nNow let me explain why I am concerned.\n\nThe target that I am assigned to reverse engineer uses javascript and jquery to accept user input. There is **no condensing of code, nor obfuscation, encoding, or any attempt to make it any harder for me to figure out how it works**. Aside from some variable name choices that spun my head around for days until i figured it out by experimentation. \n\nIt then adds user input to a array, and compares it against another for error checking purposes (its a game). Regardless of whether or not the input is correct or not, as it has **no sanitization of user input**, it will literally edit the HTML of the webpage of this \"game\" and **append the input between a pair of HTML span tags**. That allows the text to be displayed on the screen.\n\n**That is the source of my concern**. The question is, ***is it possible for someone to manually input a long string that contains a payload (reverse shell, or some sort of object that points to a foreign URL), that can infect new targets using either Reflected or Stored XSS***?\n\nHeres one article covering escaping of span tags:\nhttps://coffeeonthekeyboard.com/xss-cross-site-scripting-basic-security-part-2-711/\n\nThis one scared the hell out of me:\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/6881391/can-xss-attacker-use-span-p-label-tags\n\nA number of things the attacker must do from a glance...\n\n1. Close out the span tags that the input ends up into\n\n2. Because the app is encapsulated within its own function, everything between the closed span tags can potentially go off, because the main app is activated upon a release of any key.\n\n3. Either add a malicious block of code contained as its own function in javascript or jquery, or just insert the string right before the first function call, forcing execution.\n\n4. Throw in some threading thingy (js is not my forte but i am sure its not hard to implement threading) to allow the game to proceed normally. While the victim is being hacked under their noses.\n\nNow i am sure this is where the theorycrafting stops, because this will only go as far as popping alert boxes for the attacker's box. **But what if the attacker knows details of the webhost, and the ports open on the back end** (and I do, even the SSH ports that were switched from 22 to 222 on the target's webserver)? Can there be a payload conceived by a attacker that allows them to succeed in a persistent XSS attack? And potentially inject malicious payloads into the server itself, causing it to infect visitors? That endangers the host's firm and opens opportunities for litigators (lawsuits)?\n\nThe target selected for the reverse engineering project... well... i profiled him and he isn't the best and brightest from a security standpoint (his precious game's webpage was confirmed to have no WAF, CDN, or DDoS  Mitigation), but i can tell that he is a great coder and problem solver. He has established merit and the web app measures at 65,000+ hits, monthly.\n\nI recently observed his efforts in cleaning up his work and integrating social media and basic authentication methods  to his game to save \"hi-scores\". But i have no idea if he is already been compromised (for the amount of popularity he has i bet there are a ton of jerks out there trying to knock him down Google search results). \n\nI haven't actually tried to perform any recon outside of passive methods because I am worried that i could trigger his IPS/IDS (if it exists). There are tricks i could employ to make my traffic look like something else, but this already crosses the line into.... direct attacks.\n\nI just want to know if there is any danger to the target's use of span tags and lack of input validation. My instincts tell me, yes there is.\n\n**For now, me and my boss have reached a agreement where we build a new \"game\" from a open source template**. I have already implemented bug fixes that the original dev failed to implement on GitHub. Certain features that are present in the target's source code but lacking in our rendition could negatively affect \"the user experience\". I seek to find a SAFE workaround after close review and experimentation of alternative methods. This may clash with his goals but I feel this is the safest way. We are here to compete in a niche market, not to screw things up a year from now.\n\nAs of right now, i am regularly studying competing examples to confront the same problem (to a mechanic of this game), and i am **considering starting up two AWS instances for experimentation on the XSS theory but i need to know where to start from this**. I am guessing, i need to clone the target's webserver parameters, port configuration, and backend. Create a control instance and attempt to trigger the payload unto myself by playing \"my version of the game\".\n\n**I should take a secure coding class. So I wont break out in cold sweat over this.\n\nAny web app pentesters i can hire? For javascript, jquery, php and potentially other languages and specific coding frameworks. Up to a week, engagement is free for all 24-7 and i wont hold it against you if you succeed in extracting sensitive info. \n\nI will pay bonuses if you manage to pull that off and inform me.**\n\nI offered a compromise to my employer to insert a input validation function to check and filter out malicious inputs such as escape characters, but I am not sure where to start from this. From scratch or.... build around some sort of validator repo on Github or somewhere?\n\n",

        "text": "First off, I don't know much about the IPSec crypto suite and I'm by no means a cryptography guru. I only have a superficial understanding of technologies such as TLS, PGP, Bitlocker and dmcrypt.\n\nFrom what I've gathered, IPSec does not depend on anything like a pre-distributed set of trusted root certificates which are commonly found in the world of HTTPS PKI. Secure communication involves the so-called \"Security Association Database\" but I think it is generated dynamically and is nothing like a certificate store, despite its name.\n\nThis part made me wonder - how does IPSec prevent MITM? This may also depend on whether tunnel mode or transport mode is being used. From what I gathered, transport mode is preferred but cannot always be used due to technical constraints in bigger networks.\n\nLet's assume there are three nodes in my local ethernet network: A, B, C. A and C are uncompromised nodes communicating with each other via B, which is the compromised node performing the man-in-the-middle attack. A and C don't even know about the existence of B - they think they're directly connected to each other.\n\nSo, assuming that B spoofs the ethernet MACs and the IPv6 addresses and everything correctly - how can either side tell they're being MITM-attacked if B has been in control since the start of the conversation? Is there some magic in the AH or even the ESP portion of the package that is capable of detecting this type of attack?\n\nOr is this something that IPSec isn't supposed to prevent in the first place? Did I get it all wrong?\n\n**Edit**:\n\n/u/Swedophone pointed me in the right direction, I think. I really did get it all wrong:\n\n1. First off, I assumed that IPSec was meant to be used for general communication on the internet. This is not the case. IPSec is never really used for that. It is usually only optionally deployed between key nodes in corporate intranets.\n2. I assumed that there is no pre-shared certificate infrastructure, like with HTTPS. This is also wrong. IPSec is generally meant to be used in combination with a set of pre-shared certificates to establish trust between the nodes. It can even be used with smaller preshared keys that are typed in manually by the admin when setting up the tunnel: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/816514/how-to-configure-ipsec-tunneling-in-windows-server-2003",

This includes SaaS and PaaS that are managed by the ICT team (cloud backup, CRM, Intranet, etc) as well as SaaS and PaaS that are simply used by other staff from various departments(Social media, Productivity tools, and little bit various stuff),\n\nLooking at the data involved in these various cloud solutions, some of them contains: public consumable information, Confidential information, Customer information, even Bank account details, or info that allows people to access other systems.\neven those that simply hold public information (like facebook, vimeo, and other social media platform) can be abused to misrepresent the organization...\n\ni felt that with unlike IaaS where we have control over the port, firewall, and more security detail, SaaS and PaaS are rather different. They are agile and in a way, ready-set-go. but  i felt like \"simply trust the big brand\" to manage the security is not the right mind set. What would be the right standards / policy / practice to put in place for this SaaS and PaaS? Any suggestion or advice?\n\nI'm thinking of things like:\n- Check that SaaS Platform have encryption at rest if it holds customer data\n- Enabled 2 FA\n- Ensure strong password policy \n- Check that the platform have secure transfer encryption protocol if it involves file sharing\n\ni'm also looking looking at Cloud App Security, am i going the right path?\n\nThank you very much.",

I always bring my smartphone with me and I almost never use my data if there's a free wifi (even if with wpa personal-tkip protocol). He uses also to send me torrents or downloads of movies or software, games etc... And if I have troubles with my pc he's always ready to help me and fix everything. So he has access to my pc sometimes. I download stuff from him and sometimes we use the same wifi. Unfortunately I can't live in a bell jar...What should I do to be more alert in these contexts?\n\nI'm pretty sure he would be able to find a pitfall sooner or later, but I would like to make my stand :) \n\n\nWas tricks would you attempt if you were him?  Do you suspect some weakness from what I wrote? \n\n\nps. sorry for my English, it's not my first language. I hope it's anyhow comprehensible. Otherwise I cand try to explain better some points..\nThanks in advance!",

        "text": "Howdy.  Working on a web app api with authentication. And while I would *NEVER* store a password in plaintest in the DB, I'm wondering if I should be encrypting the password using client-side javascript *before* sending it to the server... that is, \n\nThe user enters: \n\n    Name: \"foo\"\n    Password: \"plaintext\"\n\nThat gets sent via REST to POST /api/authentication. \n\nSo the server recieves: \n    \n    { \n      name: \"foo\"\n      password: \"plaintext\"\n    }\n\nIt gets converted via bCrypt, and stored in the DB as\n\n    {\n       name: \"foo\"\n       hash: \"HashedPassword$Salt%Whatever\"\n    }  \n\nWhen the user logs in, they again send:\n\n    { name: foo, password: plaintext } \n\nAnd the API compares \n\n    bcrypt.compare(plaintext, \"HashedPassword$Salt%Whatever\")\n\nThis all seems pretty standard to me, and the way I was taught to handle authentication.  \n\nBut I'm wondering if it might be better to encrypt the password with BCrypt *before* it gets sent to the server, using a \"standard\" unchanging SALT for the client-side encryption.  Let's say that a malicious attacker used Wireshark or something to get what the client sends to the API.  \nIf the password was POSTed to the API in plaintext, the attacker now has the user's password. (It's a very directed attack, but there you go.) \n\nHowever, what if you created a bcrypt hash on the client-side, before you sent it across?  The client creates the first generation hash, and the server compares the first generation hash against the second generation hash.  \n\nNaturally, the salt for that first generation hash would have to be standard - and since the client has to have it, the attacker can be assumed to have it too.  But even if that's the case, if the attacker knows the salt is \"STANDARD_SALT79823\" and intercepts \n\n    {name: foo\n      password: vu89pnqw89pn348ip9N$10$STANDARD_SALT79823 } \n\nin order to get \"plaintext\" from that bCrypt, you'd have to convert your entire dictionary with BCrypt using the standard salt.  That would take years, even knowing the salt. \n\nNow, granted, the attacker now has \" vu89pnqw89pn348ip9N$10$STANDARD_SALT79823\" and that's enough to log into *my* service as the affected user.  *BUT* -- and this is the important thing that I think is worth considering -- let's say the user was using \"plaintext\" as their password on multiple sites.  The attacker has access to one account, but not several... \n\nI'm a full-stack NG, not a security specialist, so I'm wondering if this is erring too far on the side of either A) ineffectiveness, or B) overkill.

I have been trying to beef up the security of my home network and I've got some questions that I haven't been able to figure out about the KRACK WPA2 vulnerability.\n\nI have patched my AP (ubiquiti) and most clients (ex: windows laptops, iphones, chromecast, etc.) but I have several devices connected to my network which are old and will likely never receive an update. These include a 3rd gen Apple TV and 2 older android devices.\n\nMy question is what are the potential consequences of leaving these unpatched devices connected to my network with a patched AP? Would an attacker only be able to intercept traffic from these specific unpatched devices? Would they be able to sniff anything on my network? Would they actually be able to join my wifi network and use my internet connection / access my local resources? I am running WPA2 personal with AES/CCMP if that makes any difference.\n\nThanks for any help!",

Is there a generic and simpler way to own domain admin ?\n\n\n2.\nI understood that with a regular domain user, I can't psexec to a machine where he haven't admin rights. Is there a way to have command execution nevertheless on that machine ?\n\n---\n\nEDIT (again, but i'm forced to avoid misunderstanding) : \n\n- I know there are methodologies for pentest and my plan doesn't follow them.\n\n- I know the main objective of a pentest is not to own DA, but my goal for this particular pentest is.\n\n- I just want to have tricks or ressources to achieve that goal (other paths). That's all.\n\n- Please don't treat me like I'm right out of school since I'm pentester for years now. I just haven't had the opportunity to perform an AD pentest yet. There is a first time for everything.\n\nBig thank you !",

        "text": "Hi. I'm trying to better understand L3 side channel attacks, specifically the [flush+reload technique](https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/448.pdf). The paper describes a technique for measuring the time it takes to access memory and inferring operations are taking place (multiply, reduce, etc) based on that information. The authors describe a function called \"probe\" (figure 4) which is able to perform the measurement. It takes a single argument, the memory address to probe.\n\nWhat I'd like to understand is, *how* do they determine what memory address to probe?\n\nThe way I understand it, the memory of one process is isolated from another process through virtual page tables. As a result, I'm confused as to how the attacking program can reference any memory address that is relevant to the victim program.\n\nI understand that memory pages can be shared (as described in the paper), but I have not yet been able to make the connection between that architecture feature and the attack.",

If there was something out there indexing logs, I feel like malware authors wouldn't use them as C&amp;C servers.\n\nThis was on the IRC main wikipedia page. Maybe I'm misunderstanding it, but it sounds to me like it is indexed.\n\n&gt;There are numerous search engines available to aid the user in finding what they are looking for on IRC.[93][94] Generally the search engine consists of two parts, a \"back-end\" (or \"spider/crawler\") and a front-end \"search engine\".\n\n&gt;The back-end (spider/webcrawler) is the work horse of the search engine. It is responsible for crawling IRC servers to index the information being sent across them. The information that is indexed usually consists solely of channel text (text that is publicly displayed in public channels). The storage method is usually some sort of relational database, like MySQL or Oracle.[citation needed]\n\n&gt;The front-end \"search engine\" is the user interface to the database. It supplies users with a way to search the database of indexed information to retrieve the data they are looking for. These front-end search engines can also be coded in numerous programming languages.\n\nSo is it indexed or not?\n\nThanks",

It seems like everyone wants their entire IP range added to our SPF record.\n\nI disagree. So I wanted to point out that big players, like Google or Yahoo, have super strict SPF and it works great for them. The problem is... that they don't. For instance, take a look at _spf.google.com (used also by gmail.com):\n\n    v=spf1 include:_netblocks.google.com include:_netblocks2.google.com include:_netblocks3.google.com ~all\n\n**~all** -- softfail. How about yahoo?\n\n    v=spf1 ptr:yahoo.com ptr:yahoo.net ?all\n\n~all, ?all, +all -- they all translate to \"oh, we just don't care\". Sure, they may left warning in the logs but that's not enough, we are talking about production servers that have those settings for years. And we are talking about end users security, they don't check SMTP logs.\n\nI know about other mechanism, like DKIM, or DMARC. I know how they work (and how they sometimes can be misconfigured and useless). But the first mail security boundry, in my opinion, should be SPF in -all mode. You can't really work around that...\n\nI've netcated to one of the bigger mail servers and spoofed e-mail coming from @gmail.com with no problems whatsoever.\n\nWhy is that no one care?",
