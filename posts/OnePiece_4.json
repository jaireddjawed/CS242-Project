Some were confused, \"I'm confused what they mean by 'feeling the dirt under your fingernails,'\" but I encouraged other students to offer their understanding to assist their classmates. Some students agreed with Anders' points about vivid imagery being necessary, while others disagreed, arguing that things like histories and cultures are just as important.\n\nI then informed students that they were arguing about the pros of Hard World-building vs. Soft World-building. I then gave them the definitions for them to copy in their notebooks. Afterwards we watched clips of a video essay offering examples of each type of world-building and the effect they have on stories. While watching the video students were tasked with taking notes on the qualities of each type.\n\nAfter the video students identified the two types in panels from One Piece, shared their overall views of each type, then shared which type they preferred. Some students preferred hard world-building for more concrete details and a sense of realism. Some preferred soft world-building for the feeling of discovery that comes with putting the pieces together. I then re-iterated that although they have different uses, both are incredibly important and that a good story needs both in order to function.\n\nWe didn't have enough time to get to the exit ticket so that was assigned for homework along with reading chapter 4. In hindsight I should have had them read chapters 4-5 but I'll have them read chapter 5 as a Do Now tomorrow. Overall, though, I think the lesson went well. Students were able to explain the difference between the two types of world-building using their notes and apply them to the story.\n\nTomorrow we will continue talking about world-building, specifically with the marines, as well as Zoro's initial characterization.",

So talking entirely pre-time skip here (but post Arlong park) why does Luffy keep getting so much stronger and faster? Untill episode 238 (I think) Luffy doesn't add any new moves or really utilise the Gum-Gum fruit in any way for combat (execpt water Luffy but that was a very specific situation) anyway so we know he started off so strong because of Garp's training and pretty much just his over all childhood but after Arlong ESPECIALLY when they get to the other side of reverse mountain Luffy keeps getting more powerful without training or finding new ways for the gum-gum fruit at all!\nSo how? Is it something to do with the D clan? Or the secret of the gum-gum fruit? Like is it some Sayain logic where D clan members get stronger after every battle? Or is it because Luffy thinks that fighting makes him stronger than it actually does and the power of the Hito Hito model: Nika making it become reality? Or perhaps it's do with something like haki subconsciously doing something with his spirit/will that makes him so much more powerful after every fight? (And if you think Luffy doesn't get that much stronger pre-time skip then please elaborate to why he went from sort of struggling against Don-Krieg and Arlong too beating Mr. 5 with a single punch?)",

Which kinda proves what we’ve seen lately a strong haki will always beat a devil fruit no matter the effect of the df user. \n\nIf you know what I mean. Kinda funny but kinda makes sense.

        "text": "So, I'm a pretty recent one piece fan. I started reading the manga only few months ago and now that I've caught up to the recents chapters, I felt like visiting one piece spaces on the internet . \n\nNow the reason as to why I am making this post is not to discuss powerscaling because I see how those conversations get tedious and I don't wanna do that. I just want a proper reason as to why many people underestimate Luffy as a protagonist of his own story.\n\nHere is what led me to ask this question and that is : \n\nDespite the one piece narrative making it extremely clear that everytime luffy overcomes an antagonist he surpasses them I have found a lot of people claiming that it is not the case. In fact some even go so far as to state several reason as to why those opponents that luffy faced let him win or other theories that are not taken in context with with the narrative just to fit their agendas . So I just want to understand why is it that even if Oda makes it clear when he wrote :\" I'm the one who will surpass you and become the king of pirates\" people still claim that luffy didn't surpass doflamingo, Katakuri or even Kaido for that matter after defeating them.\n\n Please try to keep powerscaling discussion out of it if you think that Oda is showing us that Luffy didn't overcome his foes and he just lucked it out prove it to me where it is shown according to the context of the story not theories that are headcanon. On the other hand, if you think that Luffy us in fact underestimate do you have a reason as to why because I'm genuinely curious, thank you.",

        "text": "Oda built Wano’s name as a double entendre. At first glance, the interpretation could be made that The name Wa No is a pun on \"[Wa no Kuni](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wa_(Japan)) (和の国 meaning \"Country of Harmony\")\" Wa being the oldest recorded name for [Japan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan). Looking deeper, Wano can be split in half, as Wa/No, with the Wa (和) being japan’s oldest name and 能, Nō, is a major form of classical Japanese dance-drama. Oda set up this name to reference the structure and plot of the arc. Where many originally thought Wano would be based on a 5 act kabuki play, the three-acts Wano ended up with fits a Noh-style play a lot more. Noh structure is based on Jo-ha-kyū \"beginning, break, rapid\" where a standard program consists of three plays/acts chosen out of the five types of Noh play (God, Warrior, Woman, Deranged, and Demon). This can be seen clearly in Wano’s 2nd and 3rd acts, where the second act seems to be based on the second category of Noh the tormented warrior. The Tormented warrior is depicted in the clash of Inuarashi with Ashura Doji, and the sacrifice of Tomoyasu. 3rd act of Wano is clearly based on the *kiri noh mono* (demon, ending noh), where this category portrays demons, dragons and other worldly creatures. The Kiri noh is always performed at 3rd and final act and is known to have drumming and lively music, being the flashiest play out of the five. This is seen everywhere in the 3rd act, like the Onigashima celebration and the [fire festival](https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/v8zn2p/hungry_ghosts_the_fire_festival_and_heaven_and/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) but especially with Yamato.

Clouds can be literal islands in the sky. \n\nAllowing smoker to not only fly but provide his allies great advantage. \n\nScientifically speaking he could also create water \\[I guess fresh water in this case\\] and create literal via rain and cause great storms or hurricanes that could conjure lightning, strong winds or even ice. \n\nAn awakened Cloud based power could make Smoker a Sky Island Maker. \n\nAND A DEFINITE FUTURE ADMIRAL CANDIDATE\n\nThough sadly abstract thinking would also mean that no matter how high the clouds could get... They can never truly reach the Sun. Which could define the future of Smoker when Luffy becomes Pirate King",

        "text": "Hi all, I need some help finding a video from way back in the fandom's history. It was a comedy montage from roughly the same time as the original Abridged Series craze, a Youtube Poop type of thing that I *think* went by the name \"Project One Piece\", with follow-ups called \"Project Two Piece\" and \"Project Third Piece\" IIRC. If it helps jog anyone's memory, here are some bits I remember clearly:\n\n  \n\\- The meeting at Baroque Works HQ overdubbed with audio from that scene from Austin Powers where Dr. Evil drops one of his subordinates into a pit, then they awkwardly hear him escaping from sharks, being shot in the arm, etc.  \n\\- Ace using his Mera Mera no Mi powers while Arthur Brown's \"Fire\" plays in the background  \n\\- The Straw Hat crew running around Thriller Bark while the theme from Benny Hill plays  \n\n\nMost of it was just these overdub goofs. IIRC this was a relatively big deal among fans at the time, but nowadays \"Project One Piece\" is the name of a huge roblox game, so it became incredibly hard to find these videos that were already in copyright takedown peril anyway. It really is of an age with Yugioh Abridged, that sort of internet artifact from the late 2000's (though I'm pretty sure it hasn't aged as well as YGOTAS)... Anyone know what I'm talking about?",
