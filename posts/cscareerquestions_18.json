Left a high paying, unrelated profession about 6 months ago in order to become a SE. \n\nI’ve been coding as a hobbyist on and off for about ten years, but more seriously in the last 5. I don’t have a CS degree but really enjoyed studying CS topics on my own, particularly DS&amp;A.\n\nSix months ago I accepted a Junior SE position for a small SaaS company. \n\nLast week my tech lead pulled me aside and said he doesn’t really view me as a junior and asked me to help mentor one of the other juniors (who makes more than me).\n\nAnyway, I’d love to get some opinions on what my play is here. Is it too soon to push for a promotion after 6 months? I don’t think I could even reasonably expect to get interviewed externally for a senior position, since I only have six months experience on paper.",

I don't want to go for just any full time job in the meantime, because I'm reasonably worried my coding skills will atrophy if I'm spending 40-50 hrs/week working in Excel. Of course I can code in my off time, but idk how much time I'd actually be able to spend doing so and also practice interviewing, shooting out lengthy applications, etc.\n\nSo what kind of other full-time jobs are out there that involve a reasonable amount of coding for the role but aren't as oversaturated as software engineering? I've heard that data engineering is one such type of role.",

This weekend as I was reviewing everything, and thought that it would really suck to have been there for 3/4 of the year and be told I'm ineligible for a bonus because I haven't been for a full year. My first job did this to me (they didn't even give me a raise either) because I had only been there since August, and comp review was done in Nov/Dec.\n\nIf this company doesn't do prorated bonuses, could I use that as leverage for a sign on bonus? How do you think that negotiation would be taken at this point in the process?\n\nI believe I am their only candidate in the pipeline right now, and feedback from the interviews has been very positive. They already bumped up the pay above their original budget on their own, and even bumped some more when I countered. Just curious how typical this negotiation might be and if it would be bad to do now at this point. I think they are eager to get me signed on, but if they don't do prorated bonuses I don't know if negotiating further would be pushing for too much. Without it, it's still a competitive offer and I would enjoy working there, but it'd be a bummer to miss a bonus opportunity. I have 10+ YOE.\n\nThanks in advance.",

I would either want to be a data engineer, AI-focused software engineer, or product manager. The reason for the interest in this industry is that I’m interested in creating AI applications that would apply to the energy industry. I already have a few ideas for applications that I would like to build while I am getting the degree. I figured if I start working on my ideas now I would have a couple years experience coding and a project or two to show off by the time I finish the degree.\n\nI have spent the last 7 years in technical sales engineering roles in the electrical generation and transmission industries. I would like to stay in this industry but work in the development of new AI products. I can’t do this with my History degree(don’t ask me why I chose that). \n\nI am leaning toward the CU Boulder BS in Applied Computer Science, but have narrowed my search down to three 100% online options:\n\n-CU Boulder post-baccalaureate B.S. in Applied Computer Science - this one is 45 credits, would take 3 years, and $30k total. I also live really close to campus so I would be able to go to library and maybe some club meetings to feel like I’m actually in college. I want to try D&amp;D.\n\n-Colorado State University B.S. in Computer Science - this one would take 4-5 years even with my transfer credits, and would cost closer to $45k. I’m like an hour away so wouldn’t go to campus much.\n\n-AI/Software Engineering bootcamp - this would take less than a year and would cost around $13.5k.\n\nSo, computer scientists of Reddit, do you think I will be able to get into the engineering side of the AI space with a bootcamp or B.S. in Applied Computer Science, or do I need to suck it up and get a B.S. in Computer Science to improve my chances?",

        "text": "I worked for three years at a very large U.S. defense contractor after I got my B.S. in Comp Sci.  I no longer work there, but I'm still not sure if I can call the work I did there software engineering or not for purposes of my resume.\n\nIn my interview, we talked at a high level about C and C++ programming and UNIX shell scripting, so I thought I was being hired as software engineer. Although, the technical portion of the interview was comically easy, and that probably should have been a red flag to me.\n\nWhen I start working, I find out that my job title is a \"systems engineer\" and I am working in systems engineering.  The first thing I ask is: \"What is systems engineering?.\"  Well, it turns out that we produce a requirements document for a software product that the U.S. Navy buys.  The actual production of the software product was sub-contracted out to another defense contractor who used our requirements documents to produce the product.\n\nSo, now I am wondering why I was even hired. Well, it turns out they will hire almost anyone who has a  STEM bachelors degree.  I worked with lots of people with math, physics, and E.E. degrees - all the way from bachelors to PhD's.  So, why would they hire someone who knew some C and C++ programming?  Well, the requirements document we produce is very low level - almost to the level of pseudocode.  In order to verify that the requirements documents is correct and the system performs to meet the expectations, our department simulates the entire system in C++ code.  So, my job was to run the simulation code and verify the system is performing as expected.  If changes are made to the requirements document, then changes to code must also be pushed into the codebase.  If the codebase was failing automated testing on nightly builds, part of my job was to figure out if bugs were introduced into the code.\n\nSo, part of my job was definitely coding in C++ and going through steps that are used in modern software development.  We used configuration management and did automated testing and nightly builds and had regular releases.  But roles were not well defined.  Everyone in the department code check in code.  Some of the engineers didn't like using C++, so that's why they got some people who might have coded in college.  But, honestly, I did very little coding.  Most of the work was running the existing simulation code and seeing how it performed in different simulated scenarios.  Since this was a radar engineering project, you really need a lot of domain knowledge in radar engineering to be useful.  For most of my time there, I was basically struggling to understand the physics of this system.  The people who were really valuable were the people with the physics and E.E. PhDs.\n\nOK.  So, I eventually left and went back to graduate school.  But, I'm still trying to figure out what to call my time at this company.  I did write and debug and check in C++ code, but it was so very little code.  Making any change to this codebase took so much effort, because modifying the requirements document took so much effort because of all the validation and sign-offs required.  Most of my time was spent in analyzing the output of the simulation code in other tools (like MatLab.)\n\nCan I call myself a software engineer on my resume?  I did contribute C++ code to a large software product , but that product was used entirely by our own group to validate a requirements document, which was then sent out to another subcontractor to actually produce the code for the customer.",

        "text": "So, I think certifications are bullshit. At least 9/10 of them are. Doubly so if you already have a degree. I absolutely hate them. They have absolutely no bearing on programming ability, and are only useful as a metric for one's test-taking ability. Not to mention they're stupidly overpriced ($250 for the opportunity to answer some stupidly esoteric and hyper-specific questions about Java that if I ever needed to actually know I could just look up? And you won't even tell me which questions I got wrong? ***Sign me right the fuck up!!!***). I could seriously (and once did) rant for a while about how stupid and useless certifications are, but I think y'all get the gist. And evidently, I'm not alone in feeling this way. As far as I'm aware, the majority of other programmers feel the same, as do most large companies; I've heard it said that FAANG for instance actively looks down on applicants with certifications because it shows they're dedicating their time in the wrong places.\n\nHowever, a recruiter family member of mine who was giving me feedback on my resume said that certifications are fantastic additions to my resume and I should have as many of them as I can get.\n\nSo what's with the disparity here? Why are recruiters (and some companies for some reason) seemingly in love with these less-than-worthless testaments to one's ability to take a test? And is having them on my resume an overall help or a hindrance, especially since I already have a degree in a C.S.-adjacent field?",

For last few month, I've been able to arrange my schedule in most confortable way, so I have plenty of free time on my hand. Mostly, I work for 2 days, 8hr shifts, and then I have 4 day offs, so I'm thinking to start a new journey, instead of gaming for whole day.\n\nSince the childhood, I've been interested in computer science, however due to me living in underdeveloped country, it was practically impossible to study or to work on above mentioned sphere.\n\nFortunately, last few years and due to recent pandemic, there was an explosion of computer science, coding and development in my region. Two of my friends started high paying jobs in matter of months (backend and devops).\n\nSo, I've beend thinking if it's worth to start a journey and if so, what will be the most suitable field for 27yo, who has 0 knowledge regarding anything related to coding or programming.\n\nPlease share your experience, or give me some hint to start with.\n\nThank you.",

As part of the employment terms, I will undergo four months of paid training and my full-time employment will commence after the training. If I were to quit less than a year after my full-time employment commences, I would need to return the company the program training fees + stipend I received during the 4-month training period, amounting to ~$30,000.\n\nI’m worried that it would be challenging for me to transit to a regular software developer role in future as a result of taking this job. However, I do not have any other offers at time time and I’m unsure if I will be getting other offers any time soon. I’m also concerned if i were to accept the offer for now and continue to apply for other jobs, it would be difficult for me to find time to attend job interviews during the training period as it would take place in-person during regular office hours.\n\nMy background: i have a non-STEM degree but I completed a coding bootcamp two years ago. I chose to remain in my non-technical role then as I had just gotten a promotion. However, I’ve been laid off recently and now I’m seriously considering making a career switch to software development. \n\nShould I accept this offer or decline it and continue looking? Thanks!",

These teams have very little mentorship opportunities, and I'd be coming in as a core contributor. I'm focusing on these companies because:\n\n* They are more established and won't have a very disorganized system like what I'm experiencing at a startup. Everyday I'm putting out fires and doing little engineering work.\n* More pay\n* Probably less hours\n* Large tech companies aren't hiring much.\n* My startup had layoffs and I feel that another round of layoffs is not far away.\n\nWould I be shooting myself in the foot by taking one of these jobs? I want mentorship but it seems like every place wants you to hit the ground running. The teams I'm interviewing with are lean and don't have seniors to teach. I'd be coming in to immediately contribute.\n\nAt the last place I interviewed with, my direct manager would be a business person with an MBA and there would be no other engineers on the team. He didn't know what Github or code review were when I asked. However, this place pays way more than I'm making, and I bet developing simple things would get me recognition.",

Unfortunately, that company was pretty stingy on pay raises despite 10-15% COL increases in my area. I don't own a home so the rent increases hit really hard. I felt like I had to try to get higher pay to keep up.\n\nI had read a lot about Amazon before joining, mostly pretty negative stuff. But I really liked the product and the team I interviewed with seemed good. I thought it would be a good learning opportunity. I accepted the offer and it was all downhill from there. The manager I interviewed with was gone before my starting date, two people have quit in the last 6 months from a 10 person team, and my new manager is a total jerk.\n\nThe culture in my org at Amazon is combative and chilly. It feels like the Leadership Principles are weaponized against us. Rather than being part of a team, it feels like we're a group of engineers who operate in isolation on an extremely complex system and only \"collaborate\" when we have standups.\n\nI'd still consider myself a junior dev and I wanted my next role to be all about learning, but I feel like I'm actually regressing at Amazon. I'm really missing the mentorship and knowledge sharing culture from my previous role. I've had a lot of days where I just wanted to quit and get out of this industry entirely, but I think that's just the bad work culture getting to me.\n\nFor the experienced folks, should I try to stick it out at least 2 years? With our attrition rate, my job is somewhat secure at least for a while. I probably am learning but just don't realize it in the moment? I don't want to make irrational decisions just because I'm having a bad time, but I also don't want to squander these next few years or stay too long and regret it.",

I see you guys outting lots of stuff on your resume and i dont understand a single thing on it. My first thought would be keep it simple and dont need to go into detail.",
