        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/scifi/comments/10h0jyq/no_spoiler_review_of_three_body_problem_live/",
        "text": "Brief no-spoilers review of the first 8 episodes of _Three-Body_ (Tencent’s 30-episode adaptation of Liu Ci Xin’s _Three Body Problem_)        \r\n\r\nInfo such as where and how to watch this show for free or how to pay to watch the “VIP” experience to be included at end of review.      \r\n\r\nPreliminary info:       \r\n\r\nThis review will NOT contain plot spoilers. My purpose is to give an unvarnished verdict on the drama’s success as an adaptation from the POV of an American non-Chinese speaker who has read the novel.        \r\n\r\n_Three-Body_ is a 30-episode live-action drama covering the events of _Three Body Problem_, the first novel in Liu Ci Xin’s Remembrance of Earth’s Past trilogy. Each episode is roughly 45 minutes long; remember to keep watching as the end credits roll, as most often the drama continues to show important scenes through some or most of the end credits, especially after episode ~3.       \r\n\r\nThe drama releases one new episode/day, roughly. VIP viewers receive episodes more frequently than free viewers, but all episodes will be released free to all viewers before the end of the 2nd week of March.       \r\n\r\nI will include links to clips from the drama in this review. Don’t click if you don’t want to “spoil” your viewing experience by seeing parts of the drama in advance, however none of the clips contain plot spoilers.     \r\n\r\nReview:        \r\n\r\n7/10 stars – Review tagline: Superb sci fi adaptation with some extraneous material\r\n\r\nThe first topic: Plot, Pacing       \r\n\r\nThe drama is very heavy on the science. There is no other sci fi I can think of that engages this intimately with both concrete problems in science (including real experiments) as well as philosophies of science; maybe Connie Willis has written some that are almost as technical. However, the drama does a beautiful job of explaining everything so that even the layman can understand. This is a wonderful demonstration of what sci fi CAN be.     \r\n\r\nIn most scenes, this drama has incredible fidelity to the novel, [often showing conversations word-for-word](https://twitter.com/doopdedoop2022/status/1614621631422275585?s=61&amp;t=7BgN3LT_2e-GLHhnktSzJw). For people who love the original novel, the viewing experience is very pleasurable.       \r\n\r\nHowever, the drama also occasionally adds things that weren’t in the novel. Sometimes it’s something like a scene that we could assume happened but just never saw (example: Da Shi reporting to Chang Weisi). Sometimes the intervention is bigger: the introduction of a character we didn’t see in the novel at all.       \r\n\r\nThus far, the additions have been mixed, with regard to my enjoyment of the drama. Many of them add to my enjoyment but, as the episodes proceed, additions are beginning to detract from my enjoyment, particularly as I get to the end of episode 8. I would say that most additions prior to episode 8 seemed good or at least neutral. I really don’t know why the character Mu Xing is in the drama.     \r\n\r\nHowever, prior to episode 8, most of the alterations to the story involve adding scenes that more fully flesh out Liu Ci Xin’s characters. Sometimes people talk about how _Three Body Problem_ is great sci fi, but the characters seem kind of flat. Well, unsurprisingly for Chinese drama, the drama version aims to make the characters more human, with deeper emotional ties to the people around them. I think this is a good thing, but it also means the drama is not the same as the novel. Nor do I expect an adaptation to have zero such interventions. But it might bother some viewers.       \r\n\r\nThe biggest problem the drama has is pacing, also not a surprising to experienced viewers of Chinese tv dramas. Because Chinese dramas (hereafter cdrama) make their investments back via ad revenue, and because you can fit more ads in the longer a piece of media is, it’s not unusual to find a lot of “padding” in cdrama.       \r\n\r\nNot all “runtime padding” is bad.\r\n\r\nAnd example of runtime padding that is simply an example of cdrama-style storytelling in _Three-Body_ is the first of Wang Miao’s observatory visits (in episode 5). I won’t say much about the events of the episode, in order to avoid giving any kind of spoiler, but I will point out that it’s simply written in a way that takes its time. Suspense builds moment by moment. Perhaps it even becomes tedious towards the end, perhaps not, depending on you as the viewer. But this scene, while slower-paced than some viewers might want, is not an example of the kind of padding of which I am most critical.       \r\n\r\nIn a later episode, Wang Miao returns to the observatory in a scene that is not in the original novel. In my opinion, this return scene, while interesting and serving an actual plot purpose, is perhaps unnecessary, and is probably added to pad runtime. When you get to this scene, I’d be curious to hear your opinions: is it a good addition to the story?       \n\nOne thing readers of the English translation of the novel will notice: the drama starts in a different spot from the novel. Only it doesn’t, because the drama begins where the Mandarin original begins. Also, the drama includes [flashbacks to scenes from the Red Coast Base](https://twitter.com/justvids22/status/1615793544777633802?s=61&amp;t=7BgN3LT_2e-GLHhnktSzJw), which people who have not read the novel will not understand. They’re exciting because you get a sense of the set they have built for the RCB scenes, and it looks really good.       \r\n\r\nThe second topic: Acting        \r\n\r\nZhang Lu Yi is the perfect Wang Miao, and it will be a challenge for any other adaptations to find someone better. He is fabulous at somehow portraying this stone-faced man of science and yet also this bewildered and frightened human standing before the majesty of the universe and feeling his own smallness. \r\n\r\nYu He Wei is even more brilliant as Shi Qiang, aka Da Shi (“Big Shi”). Longtime cdrama viewers may recognize him since he has been in a lot of recent things, including _Rebel Princess_. His Da Shi has already replaced the Da Shi from the novel in my mind, that’s how great his performance is. He is very understated and humorous in his line delivery, making Da Shi personable and avuncular, though occasionally quite gruff. He’s a lot of fun on screen and one begins looking forward to his scenes.       \r\n\r\nChen Jin as the older Ye Wen Jie is also brilliant. She has also been in many other cdramas, but she vanishes into the role of Ye Wen Jie to the extent that you might not immediately recognize her as the haughty Ping Ning Princess from _Story of Ming Lan_ (the second male lead’s mother).       \r\n\r\nAll of the main roles are superbly acted. Many of the smaller or side roles are amateurish. The scientist at the observatory, for example. One of the scientists who gets up and delivers a line at a Frontiers of Science meeting in an early episode. It’s not clear to me why the casting director would hire such weak actors for these little roles after having spent so much effort to get the best people in the lead roles.       \r\n\r(cont. in comment)",

Pushing boundaries, hating to love characters and loving to hate characters. Nuanced morally gray protagonist/antagonist with a lot of agency. Larger than life reputations of characters that are deconstructed to the reader and breaks them down on a personal level. Mysterious, ominous and very atmospheric with characters you’ll never forget for better or worse. Stories that really drag the characters through absolute hell. Characters you may like in one chapter and hate the next. Any suggestions?",

        "text": "- first and foremost: the series takes its subject matter seriously, and that is a real pleasure. It doesn’t feel dumbed down by committee, at all.\n\n- It is so far truly close to the book, has the same vibe. If you are an avid SF reader who is unhappy about “vaguely inspired by” adaptations (looking at you, Foundation), then this series will not disappoint you at least for this metric.\n\n- Does it really need 30 episodes? Well, it is safe to assume that the upcoming netflix adaptation will be more compressed. In the Tencent series, an important and in my opinion fabulous early plot element featuring a camera and the aftermath takes in essence more than one episode. Yes, that could be compressed. But… at the same time I was enjoying it, I didn’t really mind. Similarly a few discussions so far seem taken straight from the book, completely (from memory).  That is rarely done in adaptations. Again, I didn’t mind; though it may be a bit too slow for some. Imagine if whole discussions of the first Game of Thrones book were filmed, that first season would also have needed 30 episodes. But again, if you find many SF adaptations too lightweight, there is much to enjoy.\n\n- Even so the first episode might be difficult to follow if you have not read the book. It features quite a few flashbacks that seem portentous, yet it might not be clear to everyone that scenes where you hear a communist song playing are taking place in the past (the early chapters of the book are set during the cultural revolution but it is less clear on TV)\n\n- In general good actors and good visuals with a smooth style. They really wanted to make something prestigious, it is not a basic low budget adaptation.\nHence, as an early indication: truly worth watching for many fans of “serious” SF. You can watch the first 2 episodes with substitles on youtube, and you should really persevere through the somewhat confusing first episode with all the flashbacks as things get seriously bizarre in episode 2.",

        "text": "So I'm writing a collection of novelettes. Something like Black Mirror or Goosebumps. Each book would be around 10k words.\n\nI wanted to know what sci-fi readers want in terms of pricing. A lot of other authors have told me not to price it lower than USD 2.99 because that's the lowest I can price it and still receive 70% royalties. anything lower will give me 30%.\n\nI feel like 2.99 is a bit too much for 10k words, but on the other hand, I'd have to sell quite a few copies if I price it at 0.99 to break even with my investment. My first book barely made back its money and it was priced at 2.99.\n\nWhat do you guys think? How much would you be willing to pay for a 10k-worded novelette?\n\nThank you in advance for your answers.",

        "text": "I wanted to make a rant on this sub about scifi and these big universes, before i start i wanna say im mainly a reader, i dont watch alot of movies or shows as i find it harder to keep attention to them. Books are just easier to consume to me and i also wanted to say that 2 of my favorite books (dune and the 3 body problem) are part of a grander universe although the 3 body problem (which im gonna shorten to 3body for convenience) is much smaller in scale.\nIt feels like whenever i find a book that interests me its a part of a series, and i get some stories need multiple books to tell the full tale but cmon it feels like overkill sometimes. Im a student who genuinely just doesnt have time for a job so i mainly rely on my allowance and its a big investment for someone with my budget to start a whole book series, why cant we have self contained stories? I genuinely feel a sense of disappointment when i pick up a book, look at the back cover and see \"continue the epic tale!\" With a bunch of other smaller covers. Maybe its just me, maybe long series just arent my thing.",

Leaving the house was kind of taboo. I think the two end up meeting in person and running away together I believe. Any ideas anyone???",
