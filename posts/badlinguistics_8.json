        "text": "Ah, Duolingo. There is such a plethora of badling in your comments section. \n\nFor context, this is the Spanish-to-English module and the sentence is \"Es tarde\", or \"It is late\" (that is: the hour is late. \"tarde\" also means \"afternoon\" and \"evening\"). To say that a person is late (that is, tardy) would be either \"Él llega tarde\" or \"Él tarda\". In this exchange between between **B**ad**L**ing **P**erson and **V**oice **O**f **R**eason, this point doesn't seem to be realized, but learners not quite getting translations right isn't badling (at least, not per se).\n\n&gt; **BLP**: The direct translation doesn't work both ways here. Tarde refers to late, la tarde being afternoon. We say 'she is late'. But she isn't, she IS a human, she is not a late.. Get it? So referring to somebody directly as BEING late (ella es tarde) doesn't really work in either language, we are just lazy, and use it like that anyway.   \n**VOR**: Just because English has different idioms and grammatical rules than Spanish does not mean we're \"lazy\". In English, we **do** say \"She is late\" because that's just how we use the copula.   \n**BLP**: Whether or not we're lazy for having a different use of the copula, is a matter of reason, and can be argued either way. I couldn't care less whether we're lazy or not, I was just trying to give another angle of understanding, and I think I did exactly that. But thanks for the input.\n\nR4: The badling is not in the Spanish but in the idea that certain uses of the copula in English is lazy. The copula is used for more than just equating two noun phrases. It can also compare noun phrases to adjective phrases in order to highlight certain qualities of the noun phrase. BLP seemed to willfully transmute an obvious adjective into a noun for his strange point. Also, this isn't \"a matter of reason\" to be argued. It flies in the face of direct observation. (Who does he think he is, an Ancient Greek philosopher?)\n\nEDIT: I just noticed a bit of internal inconsistency in BLP's argument. You can't be a late because you're a human being, but you can be lazy.",

The only times whenever this event DOES occur, is whenever a phonetic structure of a language figuratively physically can not fit into a script. For example,/: I very much like the way that the Hiragana syllablary looks, especially since I like &amp; enjoy cursive very much. However; when I tried to transliterate english into this syllabary, I immediately ran into a problem… Japanese is a syllabic language &amp; thus, cannot handle consonant clusters; writing, for example: “scratch” in Japanese is impossible. Now, Cyrillic was designed for slavic languages, however; this doesn't mean that one can't tweak it a bit in order to fit a target language, &amp; it has been done before, especially to languages that do or did use Cyrillic. I've made Cyrillic, Hellenic, &amp; Georgian alphabets for Esperanto.\nIs anyone else irked by this?",
