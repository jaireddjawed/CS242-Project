However, a friend at my wife's work told her  that she should watch season 2 because it is toned down. I did not  believe it, but my wife insisted on watching it. Needless to say, I  think this was more explicit than the first one. The cherry on top was  the tender loving nephew-uncle moment if you guys know what I mean.  Having said all of this, why the hell does it needs to be so explicit?  They can tell the same story without so much graphic. Some of these  scenes are soft core porn or one step away from being it. What do you  guys think?",

The whole show, I mean.  \n\n* [Sopranos S6E19](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Second_Coming_(The_Sopranos)) \\- that scene where Phil Leotardo turns into a house for one scene.",

        "text": "I have been watching the show just now. The show is good. It is the single best live-action adaptation of a video game property, and it is not even close. However, I am not *loving* it. When I played the game, I remember being devastated when Sarah died. I remember getting anguished by Tess' death. But watching the TV show, I felt pretty much little. Partially due to having experienced the story in the game, but I think the bigger problem is some of the structural changes they made to the story.\n\nThe biggest obstacle to the show is time. I remember in the Making Of documentary Neil Druckmann explaining how the 20 years skip felt abrupt initially because it didn't let the player grieve for Sarah and take in the tragedy, which is why he put the opening title sequence late in the game's development. The show instead puts it in the 1968 scene, and as a result, the audience doesn't have time to soak in. You have the lasting impact of Sarah's death lost in the immediate impact of the 20-year skip.\n\nFor the first episode, it is a mistake to constantly shift between so many POVs that it loses momentum. While I like the expanded Joel scenes, so many of the new scenes outside of Joel's POVs are explicit set-ups and clunky expositions, like Tess getting captured by Robert, the Firefly scene, and Ellie's new introduction. We don't need them. Information like why the Fireflies are attacking the FEDRA could have been revealed later in the dialogue with Joel and Ellie. Maybe Tess and Joel ask her why and they do some deductions about the Fireflies' motive, which would have also worked as a character moment showcasing that these characters are smart.\n\nInstead, the show cuts a lot of character demonstrative moments you got from the game, such as Joel and Tess having to fight and get to Robert. With those combat levels, we get to know that Joel and Tess are morally bankrupt people, setting Tess's dialogue *\"You set everything right. All the shit we did\"* in Episode 2, as well as their relationship with each other through \"actions\". How am I supposed to know that Tess did \"all the shit\" she did when we don't see the \"shit\"? Sure, these levels were in the game because it's a third-person action game, but we also learn about the world and the characters naturally by having the character active. These Robert levels are crucial in understanding how Joel's character has changed from the prologue. I mean the show says Joel is dangerous, but how? Now, these moments have all been relegated to expositions. \n\nConsidering Ellie's immunity is now a cliffhanger, the show also didn't do a good job of conveying its significance of it. In the game, the show stays with it, having the implication sink in for the player and the character. You have Tess and Joel denying it. Ellie urging. The show doesn't give any moment and skips it for the next episode.\n\nEpisode 2 doesn't do a great job of having the audience care for Tess. I cannot pinpoint what is at the fault, but in the game, you have a lot more time devoted to the player navigating around the city. You have way more obstacles and the characters interacting with each other. Tess helping Ellie and Joel, Joel helping Tess... Joel is isolated from the fellowship and has to navigate the dark building alone, which gives a sense of isolation in contrast to having the two characters always accompanying you. So when Ellie screams *\"We're not leaving her! Get off me, you F’Ωck–µr! I'm not going with you!\"*, I couldn't empathize with her because I didn't see enough moments where Tess helped Ellie. The show introduces her character in the middle of Episode 1 and kills her in Episode 2. That's not enough time.\n\nTo be sure, Episode 2 feeling short is inevitable due to the transition from the game to TV, and I'm not sure how they could have circumvented the problem, and the new additions in the sacrifice of building more relationships between Joel and Tess are great. As a whole, I am liking the show a lot. I just wanted to pinpoint some of the problems that stop me from fully engaging in the story.",

        "text": "As a guy born in the year of our Lord 2000 one thing l did whilst growing up was watch the Disney channel. Like lots and lots of Disney channel. In fact I only stopped watching it in 2018. One of my favourite aspects of the channel was the annual crossovers they had. I mean crossover clearly is just a form of artistic expression and not a multi billion dollar tyrannical conglomerate trying to use brand synergy to make you care about shows you never watched.\n\nSo today after having a wank I got the most zen like post nut clarity imaginable where I felt the universe had bestowed upon me the duty to document the entire Disney Channel Universe. I lost my mind 5 minutes in and what I will show is only the tip of the lce Berg.\n\nFirstly, I did not expect the Show Jessie to be a nexus show it turned out to be. It came out around the time I stopped actively watching it and only started putting it on for background noise so my home doesn't feel as quiet and alone as it always is. Main things I took away from the show was my crush on Peyton List (she's two years older than me so stfu with calling me a pedo or anything) and that the character of Ravi  set South asians back 200 years (tied with Baljeet). But they had cross over. Like a lot of crossovers. They mainly crossovered with their contemporary like Good luck Charlie and Austin and Ally but the most important crossover they had was in a episode where THE Mr. Mosbey appeared. Yes the same one as in Zack in Cody. This Key Crossover connected the universe of the 00s disney channel and the 10s disney channel.\r\n\nThat's the first batch. After exhausting all the disney channel connections I discovered one thing. This shit isn't limited to the Disney  Channel. You see Austin and Ally had a cross over with a show called Girl Meets world. Which is a sequel to a show which came out before I was born called Boy Meets World. This is the second nexus show. From here all possibilities were possible. Here I discovered a cross over with Family matters. This was huge. Family Matters crosovered with both Full House and Scooby doo.\n\r\nScooby doo being the third nexus event didn't surprise me at the least. I remember watching the old crossover where they teamed up with batman and Robin. What I didn't expect is the sheer scale of its connections. You had the WWE, Supernatural and the Teen Titans. This was a goldmine. But sadly it was at this point the post nut clarity was wearing off and my ability to keep track of all the connections started waning. At this point I wanted to give up\r\n\nYou're probably wondering why i put Spider-man in the title since i havent mentioned any marvel crossovers yet. That's because I didn't know any what I was trying to see was if there was any way to connect the nickelodeon shows like lcarly and Victorious (where i developed my crush or victoria justice) to the disney shows. There wasn't any I could find. I was disheartened until I learnt that the star of Drake and Josh (and convicted groomer) Drake Bell voiced Spider-man in a show titled Ultimate Spider-man. Why is this important you may ask? Because this show is a mini nexus event. So Bell voiced Spider-man in both Avengers Assemble\r\nand Earth's mightiest heroes (despite the superior Josh Keaton already having recorded for EMH) so either show can be cannon in this shared universe\r\nSo what does that have to do with the Disney Channel universe. You see Ultimate Spider-man had a cross over with a show I did not expect it to. Jessie. I know it sounds ridiculous but it actually happened (I would have preferred wizards). So Jessie links the marvel cartoon universe with the wider Live action Sitcom universe.\n\r\nAt this point I declared victory. I mean i proved its not illgoical for John Cena to lay the Smack Down on Captain America with Superman being his tag team partner and I started making a chart\r\nshowing all the relationship each show had with another. Problem is l'm not good at making chsrts so what I have linked in the comment section is my unfinished chart showing all of the connections\r\nthe shows have. I'm not proud of it since its quite basic but fuck it. I've lost two hours doing this shit not gonna lose any more. I realised thst I don't have to do this alone. I will leave this mission unto you my fellow disciples. Unravel these threads and find More connections my successor.\n\r\nPS Ultimate Spiderman also crossovered with Phineas and Ferb",

When his 21st birthday arrives, the Devil (played by a wonderful Ray Wise) pays him a visit and orders him to reclaim souls that have escaped from Hell. It's a monster-of-the-week type of series, but it does have overarching storylines.\n\nThe series was created by  Tara Butters and Michele Fazekas, who met while working as part of the sales and merchandising team for The X-Files. Afterward, they began researching the Antichrist with the intention of pitching ideas to Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Their ideas didn't make it onto Buffy, but they eventually formed into Reaper.\n\nIt also marked an early role for Tyler Labine, who played a character named Sock. He's the comic relief slacker who always had the main character's back, but he's given some funny individual storylines, including one where he falls in love with his half-sister. \n\nI'd recommend Reaper to everyone who likes horror shows, but it's lighthearted. It's like the TV show Brimstone by way of Kevin Smith, with a dash of young millennial angst. At its core, it's a story about a young twentysomething finding his way in life, and the demon hunting is merely part of his personal growth.",

HBO as good as their shows are they have a niche audience but on the other hands Netflix shows have a much boarder audience they can make thought provoking shows like Bojack Horseman and at they same time they can produce nonsensical documentaries like The goop lab.\n\nYou will never see shows like The goop lab on HBO because their audience will never accept stuff like that but on Netflix there is an audience for shows like it. Thus before comparing them we should remember that both platforms have different audiences and priorities.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/10l71tm/why_is_the_willow_tv_series_so_bad_spoilers/",
        "text": " I finished Willow, the tv series. It was... like watching a child stick their fingers in a door hinge. Everything was garbage -- the bad acting, the awful dialogue (\"Ugh! You're sucha DAD!\" -- word for word, this was a line in the show), the YA romance, the kids bop covers of popular songs. \n\nThe show had, by far, the shittiest costumes I've seen in a fantasy series. And this is coming from someone who likes Star Trek TNG. \n\nThis show was awful. It was too immersion breaking for me. The original film wasn't a camp film -- it was a grimdark action adventure with light comedy. Nobody was using 1980's slang buzzwords, either. Kilmer's character kept his north American accent but still carried himself with gravitas. It blended well into the setting. And Willow, as young as Warwick was (18 y.o.), wasn't talking like a modern day 13 year old. He carried himself like an adult in an adult situation.  They didn't make him talk like a teenager. He wasn't running around saying, \"COOL!\" or \"That's so LAME.\" Whereas, by comparison, the 20-something adults on this new tv series delivered lines like: \"This wagon SUCKS!\" And \"Listen, Prince Chauncy McSleazoid...\" and \"like\" in between every other word. \n\nThere was a nicer balance in the old film. It felt believable. Fantasy doesn't have to be realistic -- but it has to be believable. This tv series isn't believable at all, right down to the uber bright, colorful everything, the anachronisms, and the inconsistent, cheap costuming. (There was a lot of denim in this show. I also caught a glimpse of platform sandals on the crone/girl, plus hoodies, things like that.)\n\nToo much anachronism, and lazy costuming using modern fashion, can destroy immersion if the medium isn't a straight up comedy or straight up full camp (e.g. Xena). The Willow tv series didn't execute it well. The show came off like unintentional camp meets the CW.\n\nAs for the music, they don't need to have old fashioned medieval music, but to blatantly put in a sh\\*tty Black Hole Sun/Soundgarden cover just ruins immersion. I doubt a Seattle grunge band exists in that world. And I doubt the overproduced cover version does too. Real life pop music tracks that we hear on our radio stations, by nature, are hyper commercialized and commercialization just doesn't gel with the setting of Willow. (Although, everyone does look like they shop at Rue 21 -- plus the modern hairstyles to go with it.)\n\nIf they want to compose their own original, unique sounding music for the show, whether it uses electric guitars or a harpsichord, then that would blend better. But when they're editing in the the obligatory cover of version *Crimson and Clover*, that's where I call bullsh\\*t on their \"creative\" choices. lol! \n\nAlso, this show doesn't do a very good job at giving us cool female characters. It's just my opinion, but the writing for these women was bad. Real bad. \n\nElora is annoying, as is Kit who is just rude and whiny -- plus she insults everyone around her (she's not funny, her jokes fall flat, the writing for her is terrible), and then there's Jade who actually has a decent actress but her backstory is bland, her relationship with Kit has NO chemistry (I would not give care if they broke up, I don't feel anything for that couple... their chemistry is terrible. But really, everyone's chemistry on the show is terrible. I am not feeling any of the romances they were trying to sell). Also, I wish they'd made Jade's actress portray Elora. She would have been much better in that role. \n\nAlso... the trolls. What in the world was going on with the trolls? If memory serves, because I used to watch the 80's film on repeat throughout my childhood, the trolls were not uppity, humanlike people with a society and rules and snark. They were leaving their sh\\*tpiles everywhere to step in, right?\n\nI'm pretty disappointed. I finished season one because I don't like leaving things unfinished, but it was a grind to get through. I won't be watching the second season. \n\nEverything in this series is too bubbly. Too bright. Fake. Cheap. Cheesy. What a waste of Warwick Davis.",
