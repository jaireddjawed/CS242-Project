        "text": "I recently watched Blade Runner 2049 after a long time of putting it off because of its long run time and I have to say, I was blown away. I had heard that it was a good movie, but I didn't expect it to be that good. It was a breath of fresh air to watch a sequel that builds upon the original, had its own story to tell and wasn’t just a cash grab and the start of countless more movies in the franchise. \n\nThe visuals, the acting, the story, and the soundtrack all came together to create a truly immersive and thought-provoking experience and it thoroughly deserved its Oscar’s for cinematography and visual effects. \nIn fact, I'm now considering putting Blade Runner 2049 in my top 5 movies of all time. I know this might sound like an overreaction but the movie's exploration of complex themes like the nature of consciousness and identity, as well as its stunning visuals and incredible soundtrack really impressed me. \n\nOf course, everyone's top 5 movies are different, and I know there are many other great movies out there. So, I wanted to ask you if I’m I overreacting? I’ve seen a lot of movies, I enjoy sci-fi but it’s not necessarily my favoured genre. I rarely hear many people say they hold it in this high regard so it has surprised me",

The era is set when samurai-like swords and archers are used. There are two scenes I can think of that are below.\n\n1) The enemy walks into a village with large wooden buildings- reminiscentof Japanese temples (the roof anyways). Suddenly massive wooden walls are moved across the single road with those building on either side of it. Archers (the good guys) rain arrows onto the enemy trapped below. (I think the first arrow is aimed at the leader of the bad guys, but he catches it out of the air without even looking)\n\n2) There is carnage everywhere and the battle is over. A man- I think the good guy -stumbles along, finds the leader of the bad guys, has a sword fight, and the good guy gets impaled through the abdomen by the bad guy. Something happens, but the bad guy is on the ground, rolling in the mud saying \"I don't wanna die... I don't wanna dieee...\" Before the good guy lops his head off with the sword.\n\nI little dark, I'm new to r/movies, so I hope this isn't too bad. Please please please let me know if you even have a guess as to what this movie is, I can't tell you how long its been shifting around in the back of my mind, yet never enough to be formulated into this question.\n\nThank you!!",

Meanwhile, I'll post some short reviews on the movie. It's structured like this: **quote first, source second.**\n\n&gt; This new Shazam film is cordial, with a puppyish good nature and an awareness of its own silliness. There are some nice lines here and Mirren, Liu and Djimon Hounsou (as the ancient wizard) have some fun with their roles – albeit while looking as if the subject of what they’re having for supper after the day’s shooting isn’t far from their minds. I have to say that we don’t entirely break free of the superhero-movie template, but Shazam two has a just-out-of-the-fridge orange juice taste that makes it likable.\n\n- [Peter Bradshaw, The Guardian: 3/5](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/15/shazam-fury-of-the-gods-review-second-dose-of-dcs-imposter-syndrome-superhero)\n\n&gt; While “Shazam! Fury of the Gods” doesn’t entirely recapture the giddy fun of the first film, its humor, sweetness, and delightfully human heroes remaining bright spots in a genre too often obsessed with the dark and the gritty.\n\n- [Kate Erbland, IndieWire: B-](https://www.indiewire.com/2023/03/shazam-2-film-review-1234819671/)\n\n&gt; Like some children who aren’t so cute anymore after they’ve grown up a little, this follow-up lacks much of the appeal of its predecessor. While the film provides the elaborate action set pieces, colorful villains and save-the-world plot mechanics expected of the comic book movie genre, some of the magic is missing.    \n\n- [Frank Scheck, The Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/shazam-fury-of-the-gods-review-1235353215/)\n\n&gt; The film isn’t terrible, but it’s busy, formulaic and rather joyless. The “Shazam!” saga has been given an expensive haircut, but it’s lost a lot of its flavor in the process.\n\n- [Owen Gleiberman, Variety](https://variety.com/2023/film/reviews/shazam-fury-of-the-gods-review-zachary-levi-1235555228/)\n\n&gt; A fun, kid-friendly follow-up to director David F. Sandberg’s 2019 charmer, “Fury” piles on the mythos, monsters and magic, a smidge too heavily at times, but stays grounded, thanks to its earnestly goofy main man.\n\n- [Brian Truitt, USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2023/03/15/shazam-fury-gods-review-zachary-levi-superhero/11468432002/)\n\n&gt; *Shazam!*’s sequel, *Fury of the Gods*, has now been sent out, defenceless, into DC’s cinematic no man’s land...[Walter Hamada's] DCU could never decide whether it wanted to emulate Marvel or do the total opposite, so you’d get films embodying the very best (*The Suicide Squad*) and the very worst (*Suicide Squad*) of recent comic book fare. *Fury of the Gods* lands in the frustrating middle: a film that isn’t without promise, but feels far too messy and corporatised to have any real affection for.\n\n- [Clarisse Loughrey, Independent: 2/5](https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/shazam-2-sequel-review-release-b2301405.html)\n\n&gt; Despite the humor, the story didn’t grab me the way the first film’s did. With the exception of Freddy, who was the best. *Shazam! Fury of the Gods* is still entertaining enough and definitely isn’t stupid or badly cobbled together like *Black Adam* was. \n\n- [Kyle Anderson, Nerdist: 3/5](https://nerdist.com/article/shazam-fury-of-the-gods-review-dc-david-f-sandberg-zachary-levi/)\n\n&gt; Between a sequence that feels like a direct Skittles commercial, and a pandering attempt to bring another hero into this film, *Fury of the Gods* will likely leave you rolling your eyes more than it’ll have you cheering or laughing.\n\n- [Ross Bonaime, Collider: C-](https://collider.com/shazam-fury-of-the-gods-review/)\n\nPLOT\n\nBestowed with the powers of the gods, Billy Batson and his fellow foster kids are still learning how to juggle teenage life with their adult superhero alter egos.

        "text": "[Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/shazam_fury_of_the_gods): 68% (22 reviews)\n\n[Metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/shazam!-fury-of-the-gods): 51/100 (22 critics)\n\nAs with other movies, the scores are set to change as time passes. Meanwhile, I'll post some short reviews on the movie. It's structured like this: **quote first, source second.**\n\n&gt; This new Shazam film is cordial, with a puppyish good nature and an awareness of its own silliness. There are some nice lines here and Mirren, Liu and Djimon Hounsou (as the ancient wizard) have some fun with their roles – albeit while looking as if the subject of what they’re having for supper after the day’s shooting isn’t far from their minds. I have to say that we don’t entirely break free of the superhero-movie template, but Shazam two has a just-out-of-the-fridge orange juice taste that makes it likable.\n\n- [Peter Bradshaw, The Guardian: 3/5](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/15/shazam-fury-of-the-gods-review-second-dose-of-dcs-imposter-syndrome-superhero)\n\n&gt; While “Shazam! Fury of the Gods” doesn’t entirely recapture the giddy fun of the first film, its humor, sweetness, and delightfully human heroes remaining bright spots in a genre too often obsessed with the dark and the gritty.\n\n- [Kate Erbland, IndieWire: B-](https://www.indiewire.com/2023/03/shazam-2-film-review-1234819671/)\n\n&gt; Like some children who aren’t so cute anymore after they’ve grown up a little, this follow-up lacks much of the appeal of its predecessor. While the film provides the elaborate action set pieces, colorful villains and save-the-world plot mechanics expected of the comic book movie genre, some of the magic is missing.    \n\n- [Frank Scheck, The Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/shazam-fury-of-the-gods-review-1235353215/)\n\n&gt; The film isn’t terrible, but it’s busy, formulaic and rather joyless. The “Shazam!” saga has been given an expensive haircut, but it’s lost a lot of its flavor in the process.\n\n- [Owen Gleiberman, Variety](https://variety.com/2023/film/reviews/shazam-fury-of-the-gods-review-zachary-levi-1235555228/)\n\n&gt; A fun, kid-friendly follow-up to director David F. Sandberg’s 2019 charmer, “Fury” piles on the mythos, monsters and magic, a smidge too heavily at times, but stays grounded, thanks to its earnestly goofy main man.\n\n- [Brian Truitt, USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2023/03/15/shazam-fury-gods-review-zachary-levi-superhero/11468432002/)\n\n&gt; *Shazam!*’s sequel, *Fury of the Gods*, has now been sent out, defenceless, into DC’s cinematic no man’s land...[Walter Hamada's] DCU could never decide whether it wanted to emulate Marvel or do the total opposite, so you’d get films embodying the very best (*The Suicide Squad*) and the very worst (*Suicide Squad*) of recent comic book fare. *Fury of the Gods* lands in the frustrating middle: a film that isn’t without promise, but feels far too messy and corporatised to have any real affection for.\n\n- [Clarisse Loughrey, Independent: 2/5](https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/shazam-2-sequel-review-release-b2301405.html)\n\n&gt; Despite the humor, the story didn’t grab me the way the first film’s did. With the exception of Freddy, who was the best. *Shazam! Fury of the Gods* is still entertaining enough and definitely isn’t stupid or badly cobbled together like *Black Adam* was. \n\n- [Kyle Anderson, Nerdist: 3/5](https://nerdist.com/article/shazam-fury-of-the-gods-review-dc-david-f-sandberg-zachary-levi/)\n\n&gt; Between a sequence that feels like a direct Skittles commercial, and a pandering attempt to bring another hero into this film, *Fury of the Gods* will likely leave you rolling your eyes more than it’ll have you cheering or laughing.\n\n- [Ross Bonaime, Collider: C-](https://collider.com/shazam-fury-of-the-gods-review/)\n\nPLOT\n\nBestowed with the powers of the gods, Billy Batson and his fellow foster kids are still learning how to juggle teenage life with their adult superhero alter egos. When a vengeful trio of ancient gods arrives on Earth in search of the magic stolen from them long ago, Shazam and his allies get thrust into a battle for their superpowers, their lives, and the fate of the world.\n\nDIRECTOR\n\nDavid F.
