        "text": "Typically we share our immediate emotion/feeling: I'm sad, I'm anxious, I'm confused, etc. \n\nAnd yes, your feelings are true, but they don't always tell the truth! Get curious about them and ask 'Why'. 5 might not be a magic number. You may be able to ask only 3, or maybe you can rabbit trail through 10-20, but this will eventually lead you to the root issue of what's causing your negative feelings... Here's an example...\n\n- I'm anxious! (Nothing wrong, but too vague)\n\n- Why? (1)\n\n- I have a lot of debt!\n\n- Why? (2)\n\n- I keep using my credit cards while shopping!\n\n- Why? (3)\n\n- I feel like I don't have enough stuff\n\n- Why? ~ or ~ Why do you feel that way? (4)\n\n- I see houses online, on TV, my friends' houses, etc. and they have so much\n\n- Why ~ does this bother you/me? (5)\n\n- I feel like I don't measure up...\n\nSo looking at this, 'being anxious' or 'overuse of a credit card' *is* a problem, but it's not ***the*** problem. The problem is this person feels like their material possessions define who they are. If they can develop a healthy view of themselves and what role materials play in their life, they can begin solving the other problems in reverse: Healthy image of self -&gt; Not concerned with others' things -&gt; They can now know what's enough for them -&gt; Less credit card use -&gt; Paying off debt easier/making a budget -&gt; Financial anxiety dwindles \n\nWhat struggle do you need to get curious about? Ask 'why?' a few times.",

        "text": "Around 3-4 months ago, I started watching Vtubers making the content that usually comes to my feed related to Vtubers. I used to mainly watch tech related videos and popular streamers so I get those from time to time as well.\n\nThe problem started when in one of the videos I'm watching, the grandmother of the Vtuber mentioned a different name which I just disregarded because I'm not interested in her past life. A few hours later either by autoplay or a recommendation I mindlessly clicked a video of streamer, I realized that the streamer shares the name mentioned earlier and just sounds like the Vtuber.\n\nI stopped watching that specific Vtuber only for other videos of other Vtubers either in their previous personas or IRL videos uploaded years ago. I stopped watching them for a month try resetting my recommendations then went back again to watch a single Vtuber only to receive another recommendation of a video a streamer that looks similar to her. I didn't watch the video because the title already provided the context but it was uploaded more than a year ago.\n\nI know it doesn't sound like a big deal but when your most visited site is YouTube it kind of ruins the experience. I don't want to see their previous persona or what they look like IRL and I'm pretty sure they don't either because that's the point of them changing their persona.\n\nAny tips or suggestions is highly appreciated.

If you let the seller take charge of the repair you won't have a lot of control over how it's done and the contractor may be instructed by the seller to cover over expensive hidden damage found during the course of the work, such as additional rot.\n\nInstead you should hire the contractor yourself. That way the contractor will be working for you and will have an incentive to report additional work that needs to be done. You can then talk it over with the seller and come to an agreement how it is to be paid for.\n\nThe seller should pay for any repairs, either in cash or by reducing the purchase price. If a reduction of the purchase price will lower the amount of your loan it will save you money in the long run.\n\nEven though there are legal theories that can help a third party who is an intended beneficiary of the work the contractor does, those are more cumbersome and it's better to have the work done by a contractor who is working for you rather than for someone else.",

Let me explain, most bachelorette parties are planned by the maid of honor, by wishing happy birthday  it causes the entire group to become defensive. \n\n2 options here\n\nEither A: ask for the maid of honor and apologize and offer to buy her a drink/shot… when that’s happening she will be telling you about all the single people in her ground and may introduce you, or your friends.\n\nOr B: if the group is really really polite, you can walk away, or double down with follow up statements like “how old are you to turning”, etc until you have to backtrack and then see option A. \n\nNow here’s where you have to be careful.. sometimes the groups get REALLY defensive and be downright nasty. If you’re trending beyond sarcastic banter, apologize and get the hell out… this is likely a very high strung bachelorette party on a very strict schedule. They will not be fun, leave them alone. \n\nI’m going to acknowledge that this is REALLY corny and some might see it as douchey or like a PUA type thing..However when done correctly, its a fun way to start a conversation and it works every time it has been tried (by us at least) and honestly if you think this is WAY too impolite, etc… then you are probably not the single people out at bars/clubs it’s meant for.",

        "text": "We met in summer 2019. We quickly “fell in love”- it was the first time in my (32m) life I had felt “head over heels” and she (34f) felt the same. She’s the most naturally beautiful woman I’ve ever seen, no exaggeration. We met each other’s families and things were getting serious—saying “I love you” and making plans for our shared future—right until she broke up with me out of the blue and without thorough explanation in April of 2020, about 8-9 months later. I was devastated and confused. I fought for the relationship for months but was rebuffed. \n\nIn July 2021 we run into each other after over a year of no contact. She was in a relationship and I was single at the time. We went for dinner despite her relationship status. At this rendezvous of ours, she tells me I’m “as handsome as ever”, and we continued seeing each other (semi) platonically for a couple of months. I know this is wrong and I knew it then— she had a boyfriend and we shouldn’t have been seeing each other, but I wanted her back. She frequently complained about her boyfriend to me (he was critical of her, flakey, much older than us). I told her early on in our reconnecting that I still had strong feelings for her and didn’t want to hear about her boyfriend anymore; she told me that “was music to her ears, but that I might have to play the ‘long game’” because she wasn’t single. She interlaced her fingers with mine as she said this.\n\nWell, she broke up with her then boyfriend not long after in October 2021, and we began sleeping together a few weeks later. Right before we slept together the first time, she told me she “does love me, but is scared.” After sleeping together, she would pull away frequently (say things like “we shouldn’t have done that”) and she made a relationship impossible. I persisted. I got routinely hurt—really badly—by her cruel hot/cold treatment of me. As just one example of many, she had friends over one night and invited me. When I arrived she ignored me the whole time. Whenever I tried to contribute to the conversation, she would openly disagree with me in front of her friends (I didn’t know anyone there). \n\nAnother time, I also caught her in a lie—we had made plans one night. She texted me to cancel bc she wasn’t feeling well. Before I could respond, she texted me again, saying “can’t wait to see you tonight!” which was obviously meant for someone else. She apologized and said she had double booked herself, but really wasn’t feeling well. I then went “no contact” in Feb 2022. \n\nI missed her terribly, and reached out in April, just a couple months later. She was happy to hear from me, and by May we were now in a committed relationship (fully on the rollercoaster by this point), seemingly picking up where we had left off in our last relationship. She said she had realized over the preceding couple of months during NC how much she missed me and how important I was to her. \n\nBy June, we were saying “I love you,” going on weekend trips, and making plans to move in together. \n\nHappiest time of my life, until she abruptly ended things, yet again in sudden fashion after a weekend away with her parents in October. She was distant on the trip, and more critical of me than normal. She was frequently critical toward me in general, or undermining, or belittling. At times, I couldn’t do anything right; I made the bed wrong, she was critical of my cooking, and worst of all she told me I was “annoying” and “cringey” in a certain social situation on that trip. When we got back she told me she loved me less than she did before we left, and thought she wanted to date other people. \n\nI was devastated, again. Despite the breakup, we continued to see each other for dinner—usually at my apartment. I continued with my Herculean efforts—cooking elaborate meals for us, having her favorite wine ready, etc., but no sex and her demeanor towards me was frequently cold. One night when she came over, only a few weeks after the trip with her parents and subsequent breakup, I asked if she had started dating. She said yes, and that there had been a few. I stupidly asked if she had slept with any of them. She said she “didn’t want to talk about that with me,” to which I said “so that’s a yes.” I started getting emotional and politely asked her to leave. Less than a month earlier I was being paraded around her family like their future son-in-law, and now she was sleeping with other guys, just like that. \n\n\nIn the beginning of our relationship (both times), I experienced “love bombing” —she would say things like “I hope our kids have your face,” “I can’t wait to move in with you,””I love you,” “I’m crazy about you” and “you’re so important to me.” This love bombing quickly shifted to devaluation (frequent criticism over small things despite my endless efforts to please her, belittling, prioritizing others over me, withholding affection, etc). It went from 0 to 100 and back to 0 again, in a matter of months. I was an objectively good boyfriend. I loved her endlessly and passionately, and she was my main priority. \n\nI reached out to her over Christmas, only to be told she’s now in a “serious” relationship and doesn’t “feel right about seeing each other one-on-one.” The wound gets deeper and deeper. \n\nI recently ran into her the other day at CVS, turned down the isle and boom there she was. I walked up and said hi, she gave me a hug and I wished her well etc, and walked away. Seeing her was absolutely heartbreaking and I can’t stop thinking about her. I really just want to reach out to see how she’s doing— I care about her so deeply I can’t help it. Her birthday is coming up soon and I just know I’m going to reach out. I don’t think I’ll be able to resist. \n\nDespite all the times she’s hurt me, I still want her back, desperately. It’s been months and the anxiety is still killing me. I wake up most nights in a cold sweat after dreaming about her; they’re more like nightmares though. They’re dreams of her “with” her new bf, or humiliating me publicly, or some such thing. The thought of her falling in love with this new guy is destroying me. I picture him being better than me in every way. \n\n\nI’m sorry for the long post, and if anyone has any ideas or insights as to her behavior, or what I should do, please share because I’m at a loss and can’t get over it. Thanks for reading.",

We both felt that it validated our decision, as we both will always have each other's back even if we're in the middle of an argument.  Felt nice in the moment.  Didn't think about it again for a couple of years.\n\nBut now I'm witnessing the dissolution of 2 marriages of two separate friends.  The advice keeps popping into my head.  Whenever they're telling me what they're going through, and what went wrong for them, I listen with love and without judgement, but internally I reply, \"But you didn't have his/her back.\"\n\nFor one couple, the newlywed husband and wife kept talking to their own parents about everything that was wrong with the marriage.  The in-laws on both sides began hating their child's spouse, and would...  start having toxic discussions about what the spouse needs to do to improve, and how they're falling short.  They would openly insult the spouse and my girlfriend would just let them.  The newlyweds began visiting their parents separately, which became entire weekend-long echo-chambers of negativity.  They filed for divorce after 1 year, after being best friends for 4 years.\n\nIn another couple, my girlfriend will always have her husband's back, but she chose someone who never has her back.  She kind of loves him more than he loves her.  The crazy thing is that he basically told her that it would always be that way but she still chose to marry him.  Now they have a special needs child and he disappears for days at a time.\n\nI can think of another couple of examples...  but I'll stop there.  Does this advice resonate with anyone?  Or am I just overthinking?",

        "text": "I recently had a severe vision worsening due to a very long period of constant use and stress. I astigmatism symptoms got worse, and I started gradually losing the ability to see further than 10m. away for around a half-year period.  Went to an ophthalmologist and he said that the time to wear glasses have arrived and that from now on I would have gradually worsening issues that came with age, said that in a year or so I would probably need surgery or laser correction. \n\nOnce home, I met my neighbor (a sweet old Russian woman) and during the short chat, I told her about my vision issues, to what she suggested I should check out the \"Zhdanov exercises\", and that her ophthalmologist made her do back in Russia when she started having some issues when she was young, and that they helped her a lot. \n\nSo, after some research, I found out about them (had to use Google Translate because there were no meaningful results in English), the theory behind them (basically that many vision issues are caused by muscle strain and blood flow problems, and since these problems aren't caused by malformation or eye structure deterioration, they can be \"trained away\" ), and decided to give it a try, because \"why not\"? \n\nAnd oh boy.. only after a couple of days I started feeling that my vision was getting better! :D. After around 3-4 weeks most of the issues disappeared, and now (around 2 months in, with some random exercising) I'm almost back at where I was, with no issues whatsoever! \n\nSo, in case anyone is on the same ship I was, here is what I found and translated for a couple of friends, hope it helps you as well!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**INTRO**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nVision is one of the most valuable human skills. However, over time, for many people, the world around us doesn't seem as clear as before. Vision begins to deteriorate. As a result, you should consult an ophthalmologist to find the right way to correct your vision. In this case, many are interested in the question, could something be done to prevent visual impairment?\n\nPhysicist and psychologist Professor Vladimir Georgievich Zhdanov has developed a vision restoration complex, a combination of the theory of William Bates and  G. A. Shichko's techniques.\n\nZhdanov believes that when a person begins to see worse, there's a chance of the eye muscles being constantly under tension and failing to control our vision focus, which leads to muscular spasms and the reduction of oxygen supply to the vision apparatus through the reduction of the capillar's blood carrying capabilities. The set of exercises is designed to eliminate these problems.\n\nZhdanov's technique is suitable for people with a diagnosis of myopia, hyperopia, astigmatism, strabismus. And these exercises will also be useful for those who experience visual fatigue during work. \n\n*However,* ***there are cases where these exercises are contraindicated****: a threat or detachment of the retina, being in the rehabilitation period after eye surgery or having particular hereditary eye diseases which aren't related to the mentioned problems.* \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Consult your ophthalmologist before trying any of these exercises!***  *(or try doing only them partially to see how your eyes react to them)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**THE EXERCISES:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe basic rules for the Zhdanov complex are:\n\n* Regularity. Perform exercises 3 times a day, for at least 10 minutes.\n* Gradually increase the amount of exercise. At first, it is sufficient to do 6 exercises, adding 1-2 per day.\n* During the execution of the complex, there should be no feeling of tension, sudden movements should be avoided.\n* Positive attitude for good results. Think only about the pleasant sensations and the benefits that you bring to your vision by doing this gymnastics.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**FIRST SET** (closed eyes):\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. **Palming.** Palming is performed when the sun or other light source is behind you. Rub your palms together to warm them up, and then apply them firmly to your closed eyes. Your fingers should cross perpendicularly, with your nose between your pinky fingers. It's best to sit with your elbows on the table during this exercise. The exercise consists of looking into the darkness and imagining some pleasant images. The result should be a feeling of complete relaxation of the eyes and the disappearance of light reflections.\n2. **Rapid blinking** for a few seconds, without straining your eyes.\n3. Slowly move your gaze left and right with the maximum amplitude.\n4. Slowly move your gaze up and down.\n5. Slowly move your eyes diagonally.\n6. Slowly draw a rectangle with your eyes, first in one direction, then in the opposite direction.\n7. Slowly draw a circle with your eyes clockwise and counterclockwise.\n8. Slowly draw snakes. Look up and down, moving from left to right and vice versa.\n9. Slowly draw vertical and horizontal \"8's\" with your gaze. \n10. Slowly move your gaze to your nose and to the sides.\n11. \"Winding\". Imagine a vertical glass tube that you wrap with an imaginary rope. After 5 turns, mentally place the tube horizontally and do the same.\n12. **Rapid blinking** for a few seconds, without straining your eyes.\n\n*(Points 3-10 should be repeated 10 times****)***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**SECOND SET** (eyes open):\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. **Focus.** Imagine a butterfly sitting on the ceiling. Then imagine it moving towards your eyebrows, then flying towards the wall, landing on your nose. From the nose, the butterfly moves to the floor and then to your lower lip. Then blink and repeat 6 more times.\n2. **Central fixation.** You can do this exercise wherever you are. Begin by looking at some object as a whole, and then delve into the details. For example, look at a tree, then some of its branches, and then a leaf.\n3. **Near-far.** Find the further object you can find in the horizon (the further the better). Focus on it without blinking for 20-30 seconds, then place your finger in front of you and focus on it for 20-30 seconds (without blinking), then switch to the object in the distance. Repeat this 3-6 times.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**THIRD SET** (individual eye strengthening):\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Perform reading, watching TV or daily activities with one eye covered  (not closed), for 15-20 minutes, then switch to the other eye (can be covered with a patch or a bandage that leaves the vision completely dark in that side). When reading, try to gradually bring the book closer to your eyes to exercise your focus, then place it away at your normal reading distance.\n\nThis will correct muscle development imbalances that might have arisen naturally due to your eyes attempts to automatically \"fix\" the overall vision issues caused by their individual worsening. (Your left eye started having issues, and the right one began to compensate for that, which led to a feedback look of both eyes compensating for each other).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*TL;DR: Some sets of eye exercises that might help your vision if the issues are caused by chronic strain, muscular imbalances due to minor issues in individual eye structural elements. Consult your ophthalmologist if you have a serious issue, and try them gradually to see if you don't feel any pain!*",

        "text": "“Just do *x*”, or “have you tried [this one simple thing]” trivialises their issue, which is often (perceived to be) complex. \n\nThe best thing to do in many of these situations is to listen and show empathy. If they appear to be genuinely stuck, offer suggestions about where they may find quality help. \n\nThis will strengthen the bond with your friend, makes them feel heard and seen, and will usually give them more of boost then any kind of “quick fix” will. \n\nOften times they already have a good idea about where a problem lies, and understand they need help, and may be looking for a bit of a nudge to find that help. Often, they just want to vent and seek understanding.",
