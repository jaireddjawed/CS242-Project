Im average height and above-average attractiveness for a man. I don't do any drugs and I only drink 3 beers a week.I hardly ever play video games. I have a great diet. I've tried to perfect how a live my but Im still sad and here's why. \n\nI try to help people and show them respect, but inside I'm Narcissistic, hyper-judgmental, Jealous, and Petty. People can see right through my facade. I put myself on a pedestal yet I still think of myself as inadequate. I view the people around me as flawed and weak. This paradigm of thinking is separating me from the society I long to be a part of.  I meet new people and never hear from them again. People say things like \"Who is he trying to impress\". I just want to make one good friend and meet a girl that I can give my world to, but I'm both too picky and people don't like me. The only people who talk to me are degenerates, losers, perverts, geeks, etc... This isn't because they like me but because they enjoy the attention and company and have no other sources. I want to view myself and the people around me as equals. What is some advice or a book for a narcissistic piece of shit like me to read? This is serious btw not satire. I'm not sure if this comes off as me being a dick but I really need help.",

I was first really depressed when I moved here after college (my college is just a town over) but over the last few months I’ve grown a lot and become a lot happier. But I still feel like I’m missing out on something by living in the same place my entire life. Now that I’m financially independent I want to try moving to nyc where I’ve always wanted to live. But should I still go now that I’ve learned how to be happy here? Its strange, I think where I currently live has appealed to me more ever since I announced I’m moving across the country and it’s making me second guess my decision. I would also be in a long distance relationship for a year while I’m gone which I’m okay with because it’s a really strong relationship that I have faith will continue for many years if not lifetime. \n\n\nDoes moving help with self improvement?",

I got a little distanced from myself, but that's okay, cuz I tend to be too emotional over stuff. I'm trying to work for my future, but I know that only present moment is real and I try to live it fully. I can't change my past, it already happened, it's gone. And here's the problem. Every time I see or hear about somebody else's experiences, I kinda feel bad about myself. I have never been in a relationship, I missed so much events and memories I don't have, as I was basically playing video games all day and I started truly living like a year ago, even though I should be \"20\" this year. I have little few memories from my adolescence, because I was stressed ALL the time and my mind was occupied by it. Sometimes when I overthink it, I feel like an alien. I can't relate to anybody, and anybody can't relate to me. Recently a girl asked me about my relationships. She wasn't single since 14. And I lied to her. I feel like it's a huge turn-off, being single for 20 years. And it's not like I am emotionally unavailable. I've loved multiple girls, but it was never reciprocated. Friendzone after friendzone, because I cared too much and gave too much. \n\nI know that all I have is \"now\", but aren't we a resultant of our past? If so, I am totally fucked. Everything shows that it's true, no matter how much I am trying. Maybe before the age of 40 it will all balance each other out and I will be complete.",

        "text": " \n\nThis is going to come with a personal anecdote and is on a throwaway because some buddies know of my account.\n\nI am 18M and attend a large university. At the beginning of the year, I struggled talking making new friends somewhat, but was able to invite older friends up and had a roommate that I've known for years so my life wasn't miserable and I was able to go out and have a good time.\n\nI'll be blunt: I am a good looking guy. I'm 6'1\", have good long hair, have been told by dozens of people I look like a popular and good looking celebrity. So when it all sort of clicked about a month in, I began doing well for myself. I was able to approach girls when I went to the bars; I didn't need my hand to be held by my other better looking friends. I went to a date party with a junior when she knew I was a freshman. I'm no 10/10, but respectfully, I believe I am probably a solid 8. I don't want to sound cocky, because my current mindset is laughable, but I feel this is necessary context for my situation.\n\nI loved going out and meeting new people. And then over Thanksgiving break, I got an absolutely horrific haircut. I lost a chunk of my confidence, but I still had my personality, which like I said, had really started to flourish once I became comfortable with myself. I had friends, some of which were girls, who still liked talking to me.\n\nHowever, when we came back from winter/Christmas break, it's like it all folded. I can no longer hold a conversation or keep people engaged; the same people who found me hilarious before no longer find me charismatic and funny like before. Quickly, I started getting into my own head (if you couldn't tell) and that seems to have escalated the problem ever further. I no longer have the confidence to say what I said before. I tend to think part of that is because the things I was saying were not the nicest (I was an asshole sometimes) but people seemed to like that. I had unique traits about me and was not afraid to say what others were thinking.\n\nI started to blame it on a lack of alcohol, as whenever I drank, it seemed like the words I wanted to say could finally come out. I believe many have experiences like that. However, at this point and time, that has also gone away; I am still the quiet and shy guy when I go out and it's very frustrating.\n\nI know that I overthink and shouldn't but for whatever reason, it's very difficult for me. I feel like every minute thing that I do or event that happens plays a role. Are my jokes no longer funny because my faux-Italian accent that I gained during the fall has faded? Is it because my skin has some acne? I see other guys and I wonder, \"how did they do it?\" It's like an endless circle of thought.\n\nI've had some realizations, such as the fact that I don't need to get shitfaced every time I go out to the bar. We are currently on spring break and I am staying home, but I feel like a shell of my former self. My mental health isn't the best and I'd like to come back with hopefully the old me back, but at the bare minimum, some goals/progressions I can make for the future.",

        "text": "What the title says. There’s this really really good looking guy I’ve liked and obsessed over for about about 6 months and still ongoing and I feel like it’s unhealthy for me in a way. I know he has a gf already but for some reason my mind disregards that. Its also not like I’m trying to make a move on him or anything, he doesn’t know I exist and I’m perfectly fine with that, he’s just so attractive for some reason. I don’t want to interact with him, he’s way out of my league anyways. I just want to forget that he exists or find something else to attach myself to because it’s wasting a lot of my time and thoughts. But whenever I see him I get so happy and it becomes my only source of happiness throughout the day (that sounded really exaggerated, it’s not that dramatic) and I tend to obsess over those moments I see him due to the fact I don’t often see with him (maybe like half hour a day). I’m a person who finds one thing to attach herself to and obsess over very much as a source of happiness (not that I don’t have others but I focus on that main one during that time and it lasts throughout the day or begins in the anticipation of that and it becomes a prominent part of my whole day). How do I begin to unattach myself from him?? I’ve tried avoiding him and not looking at him or paying attention to him, have my friends help (the most they can really do is say the true negative stuff about him but I’ll defend him with my life and give him the benefit of the doubt even if it is true), finding someone else, finding a hobby or something to take my mind off of him, finding something else to attach myself to, going over the negative things about him and telling myself it’s not worth my time to obsess over him, etc, but whenever I see him I can’t help myself and I end up back at square 1. Any advice?????",

So we started talking daily. (Actually the days I don't talk with her feels really isolated and bad now, which may be whole another problem)\n\nAnyways, since I don't usually talk with anyone else, and always had been quiet my whole 18 years of life, I feel like I'm really bad at conversations and I'm boring her, even though she didn't say anything related to this.\n\nI feel like I have a lot to say, but I can't get any words out of my mind. We often sit in silence on the phone and not say anything for up to 30 minutes (which is not bothering me, but I feel like I'm the most boring person and I should do or say something)\n\nAlso for the same reason I'm also really bad at expressing emotions. Everything I say sounds like I'm dead inside and have no emotion in me whatsoever. (Even at times I'm really happy/excited or sad/angry) which once again makes me think it's really hard for people to talk with me, because talking to me is basically the same as talking to a wall.\n\n\nTldr: \nHaving social anxiety most of my life made me have really bad social skills, and every time I'm trying to socialize, though I have fun when talking with others, I feel other people don't enjoy talking to me as much. \n\nSame goes for expressing emotions since I learned how to hide my emotions so well in the past that I cannot express them now even if I wanted.\n\n\nWhat do I do?

He was the closest person I run to and enjoyed my time with, he was a best friend, best dad, but when drunk, I had to run away from him. Later, my mom betrayed on him and I hear him even now screaming and calling her a bitch. I NEVER shared with this anyone knowing they wouldn't understand me. I haven't yet anyone. When I cried once, that person \"don't cry\" I distanced myself from anyone for 5 years and got marginalized from my society. I live in a developing country, in a city where seeing a therapist isn't available. \n\nMy social skills aren't great, I can't talk with sweet words \"honey\", \"darling\" etc. Please help me.",

I used to be perfectly happy alone I have plenty of fun by myself and do a lot of things, now though it just feels really bad. \n\nThe answer is always no for some reason no matter who I ask or what I do I can't get a date. I assumed this was because I was fat or didn't have enough money or something like that but now I'm at a point where I've been smaller and had money and it didn't make any difference. I think I'm awsome and I've tried so hard but it just seems like no one wants me. dating apps don't seem to work and ugly girls seem to be insulted if I ask them out the pretty ones are at least nice about it.... I just don't get it I'm told that I'm not bad looking, I work hard, people seem to like me when they give me a chance. But as an adult even meeting anyone seems impossible. \n\nNow I'm having financial issues and it's so hard just to wake up in the morning. I feel like I've done everything that can be done alone and I just want to feel something again at this point I just want a family but I don't even have someone to talk to the only people that seem to want anything from me only want money and nothing else and now I don't even have that. So how do I get a date in the first place? How does anyone live in this hell hole alone?",

        "text": "You can't find time to work on your goals until you know what you spend your time on in the first place.\n\nYou might have a general idea of the things you spend time on. Maybe you spend a few hours on your phone a day, a lot of minutes hitting snooze on your alarm, or, if you're like my little brother, at least fifteen hours in the bathroom.\n\nIt's okay to have a general idea, but we've gotta dial in and know exactly how we're using our time. And the only way I've learned how to do this is by tracking myself, and I'm gonna ask you to do the same. And no, you don't have to download some overcomplicated app to do this, all you need is your notes app.\n\nHere's a snapshot of one of my time trackers, so you can get an idea of what tracking yourself looks like. Notice how I'm not checking in every hour to write down what I'm doing. I used to do that, but that got old really fast.\n\nYou don't have to compulsively write down what you're doing hourly if you don't want to. Every time I start a new activity, I pull up my notes, write the time, and a few words describing what I'm doing now and what I just finished doing. That's the gist of how I track myself.\n\nLet's say I started cooking breakfast after having read for some time. Before I start cooking, because I'm switching to a new activity, I'd check the time and write something like, \"11:23 AM, finished reading. Making breakfast.\" Then let's say after I finished breakfast and cleaned up, I decided to watch TV. Since I'm starting a new activity, I'd check the time and write in my notes, \"!2:36 PM. Finished breakfast, washed the dishes, and cleaned the kitchen. Gonna watch TV.\" And I'd repeat this process with every new activity I start until I head to sleep.\n\nDoes that make sense?\n\nGo to your notes and title it \"Daily Activity Log\" or \"Daily Log,\" and for 2 weeks, track everything you do. From the second you wake up, open your notes and log in the time. \"6 AM woke up, getting ready for the day.\" Go through your morning routine, and when you start something else, log it like we've mentioned. Do this for 2 weeks, and at the end of it, check over your daily log.\n\nNow you know exactly how you're spending your time. You'll see patterns you unconsciously follow, a lot of time wasters, and big chunks of room for improvement. Once you've got the full picture of how you're spending your time, the next step is to figure out what you can cut out entirely or spend less time on to make room for working on your goals.\n\nMaybe you recognize that you have the habit of binging Netflix around 2:15 up until 4 every day. Maybe you recognize that you spend an hour and a half cooking, eating, and cleaning up after breakfast, mainly because you're distracted by your phone. Maybe you go out for groceries and spend way too long there just browsing items. \n\nDepending on what matters to you, you could use the time you habitually binge Netflix and use that for working on your goals, meal prep breakfast and use your phone less to cut back on the time you spend on that, and go to the grocery store with a list to get you in and out faster. \n\nNow with the time you save, you can dedicate it to your goals. \n\nLet's say you decided to meal-prep your breakfast, and now that half-hour breakfast time drops to 45 minutes. Now you've got 45 minutes to go workout, read that book, film some content, study for that test, or whatever you wanna do. Let's also say you don't want to completely cut out the time you spend on Netflix and decide to watch from 2:15 until 3 instead of 2:15 to 4. Well, now you've opened up an hour to get some deep work in. And you can repeat this eliminate, reduce, replace process until you're satisfied with the amount of time you've now made to spend on your goals.\n\nTime management is crucial when reaching your goals and ultimately changing your life, but not many people know how to manage their time. It all comes down to knowing **how** you spend your time as accurately as possible so you can manage it and move things around. But nothing can be managed if you have no data to work with.\n\nThat's why tracking the time you spend on daily activities is key to finding the time to work on your goals. Spend 2 weeks tracking yourself. At the end, review what you've found, and you'll see endless space to structure your goals in time.\n\nAnd remember, time is passing anyway, so you might as well start taking action, working on your goals right now.",

        "text": "Gratitude is an emotion that can help us express appreciation for what we have and the people who have made our lives better. It is an attitude of thankfulness and positive acknowledgment of what we have been given. Gratitude has been linked to mental, physical and social benefits, such as increased happiness, improved physical health, better relationships, and improved sleep. With gratitude, you can retrain your brain to focus on solutions and not problems.\n\nGratitude is the best attitude. It helps change you and change your brain. There are medical studies that have shown that gratitude helps reduce stress hormones like cortisol by 23 percent. It also promotes lower blood pressure as well as heart health and it promotes better eating and sleeping habits but most importantly gratitude helps rewire your brain so that you're focusing on solutions and not problems energetically. When you're in gratitude, you're focused on abundance and not lack.\n\nEnergetically, appreciation is an energy of acceptance and non-resistance, you feel abundant, and without resistant energy in your body, it’s much easier to bring what you desire into your life. Gratitude is key for manifesting more of what you want into your life.\n\nHow to start practicing gratitude?\n\nStart by journaling, do a journaling prompt what am I grateful for today? You can think about things like being healthy, being able to get out of bed every single day that's a privilege that you're able to hear and see have access to the internet where you have access to the best information in the world. These are the things that we take for granted that we don't realize. So step into abundance, step into feeling better, step into better heart health.",

So this new job sounded good, it wasn't much extra money but it was a little bit extra, enough to make me move, sounded good but a lot more stressful. \n\nI don't agree with \"dying\" for an employer so to speak, I don't stress. I get the work done and do it really well, but that's it. As soon as I leave the office I'm done for the day and don't care. I wouldn't be there if it wasn't for money.\n\nSo safe to say, as long as I'm getting paid I don't care. My current employer has counter offered me very close to what I'd get by moving, making the move basically pointless for anything other than a change of scenery.\n\nBy the sounds of it, new job would be more stress, lots more work, more managing of others, fixed hours of 9 to 5. Very corporate sounding.\n\nMy current job is no stress (other than sometimes a deadline), easy work environment, work pretty much whenever I want, I do my job and as long as it gets done that's all they care about, fully remote, friendly team and not corporate so to speak.\n\nBUT, my new job would be more professional development, current job is less so. I'm stagnant from where I am now basically.\n\n**Tldr**; What else should I consider when looking at new jobs?\nIt's either, go for the stress, fixed hours, corporate setting, more development of my career and same money.\nOr go for the easier life, flexible hours, no development from where I am now and same money.\n\nBut I'm sure there's more I'm overlooking",

However, during weekends or school holidays, I \"come home\" right as I wake up, I do my regular 2-3 hours of work and then I have nothing else to do or the work I did made me too tired to keep going.. Other people would just watch netflix for 10 hours but not me. Now, I should go and play a game, but I feel bad about doing so. After all, I have all this time left to spend on something productive and instead I \"waste\" my time like this? I might be tired, depressed, unfocused, the work I would do would be miniscule, yet if I start doing an activity that isn't extra credit or something that will give me the impression of getting forward, I feel even worse. It's a lose-lose situation - either feel bad about not being productive or feel bad because my productivity is none and I am not enjoying my free time. \n\nHow do I change my mindset to allow myself to enjoy week long holidays when there's literally no school work and I have the time to do nothing and enjoy my being, or, how can I start doing tiring things (such as learning, programming, reading) for hours a day, so I can be satisfied with myself on free days?\n\nPlease just ask if anything is unclear.

And because I dropped out with different majors, I don't have the right credits to transfer into the program I kind of desire (I mostly desire a career in film and music because performing makes me so happy, but I gotta be realistic). It would take a year and a half and my financial aid only has a few semesters left. I just don't see a point in continuing right now when it's possible I might have to withdraw again. And I can't take out loans.\n\nI currently work in mental health where they do offer classes in mental health related things. Because of this job I am CPR certified. So I'm sticking with this job, because it's nice and pays well, but I do plan to move to another state and thought maybe there could be some sort of certification program I could take online?

We goed to school together and were good friends until she moved locations, entered puberty and changed her interests. We both changed interests and slowly started to not talk too much with each other. A few years later I was flirting with one of our mutual friends and there we got to see each other and our connection was totally normal, she changed a bit and went through puberty so her body changed too, but I didn't even look at her from that perspective since we knew each other so long it would be weird.\n\nRecently I made this friend who happend to know that girl. It looks like he liked her but unsuccessfully tried to flirt with her. I didn't know this and one day he asked me if I knew her and I said yes. Since we knew each other for quite some time now I told him about her, since I knew her far better then he did. I told some thing that are to keep for themselves like when she got drunk, stupid things she did and in the talk said thing about her family relations. But I didn't say any secrets since I don't know any since we're not that close.\n\nA few months go by and now he's gaslighting me how I have a crush on that friend, how I told too much about her when he first asked me and etc. I think he is mad that he couldn't get in relationship with her. I do regret that I told him anything about her but when I looked back it was a way to make a friend with telling stories. As I said I didn't have any secrets and if he asked anyone else about it they would know. Now he became a toxic person and I want to cut it with him but did I actually tell him too much or is he just trying to make me mad? And how could I cut ties with some people who I see on a daily basis?\n\nTL;DR: I lightly gossiped about my friend and now my colleage is gaslighting me. How do I cut him off? And did I actually made a mistake?",

        "text": "97% of people are losers because their mind is holding them back. I've written many posts about self-improvement that've gotten decent attention. Recently, I've noticed a trend in the comments that made me realize 97% of people are losers. \n\nI made this one post giving advice on how to actually do the work you don't feel like doing, and in that post, I said, don't do anything fun until you've done your work. So until you do something, you can't get on your phone, play the game, watch TV–– none of that. Some people found the advice helpful, but this one comment caught my attention.\n\nThe user said something like, \"This won't work for people who don't have discipline.\" And I'm like... bruh.\n\nIf you don't have the discipline... then get it.\n\nI'm so tired of people hiding behind excuses and fixed mindsets. That's the main reason why most people never reach their full potential. They literally talk themselves out of it.\n\nDo you think I'm some naturally disciplined person? I'm not. Heck, for 18 years, I didn't even know discipline was a word! I was the laziest person ever. I procrastinated on everything, ran after pleasure and comfort, and never did anything outside my comfort zone. \n\nSo how did I change into the person I am now? By changing my mind. It's that simple.\n\nAnd no, I'm not saying lie to yourself and find the cheesiest affirmation to uplift yourself–– no. If you've been lazy all your life, saying, \"I'm the most disciplined person ever!\" Won't change a thing. You'll still be an undisciplined loser.\n\nWhat I'm saying is, change the dialogue to something more empowering and growth-orientated so you can actually make the changes to become the person you wanna be. \n\nInstead of saying, \"I'm disciplined,\" when you know you're not, say, \"I'm not disciplined yet, but I'm going to do something today to build my discipline.\"\n\nCan't you feel the difference? You accept the reality –– you aren't disciplined. But you don't stop there like most people who throw up their hands, thinking it's out of their control, do. No, you recognize you have control over whether or not you stay undisciplined. You recognize you can do something about it, and that's what so many people **don't** do.\n\nThat's why 97% of people are losers.\n\nThey talk themselves out of getting better, reaching their goals, or even stepping one pinky toe into the game. And there's no point to it!\n\nI don't understand why people are so comfortable holding themselves back and defending all the reasons why they can't. What does that do for you? Seriously?\n\nIf you say, \"Oh, I can't do this because I'm not smart,\" and I say, \"You can do that. You just have to learn,\" and you hit me with, \"OK, easy for you to say, but I can't learn.\" ––I'm leaving the conversation because there's no point. \n\nYou can. You just don't\n\nWe are human beings. We can do anything we want because we can think and plan. One of our most OP powers that so many people are sleeping on is our ability to ask how. That one question, \"How?\" is the reason humans dominate the world. Imagine if our ancestors looked at some saber-toothed tiger and thought, \"Welp, I'm a weak human. I can't win against that. I'll die.\" We wouldn't be here!\n\nNo, they thought, \"How can I survive? And that changed the game entirely. You can do the exact same thing.\n\nIf you're undisciplined, ask how can you get disciplined? If you're a procrastinator, ask how can you get your work done? If you're unmotivated, ask how can you get motivated? Don't just throw in the towel and hide behind excuses.\n\nFigure out how you can do better and grow. That's it.\n\nAnd if one thing doesn't work out, return to the drawing board and ask how again. Experiment and find what works for you.\n\nIf I tell you to do your work first before anything fun, and you come at me saying that won't work for you, you don't have the discipline... Then find a way that works. Stop closing your mind off.\n\nI understand what works for me won't work for every single person on the planet. But for you to complain rather than look for a solution to your problem makes you a loser. Period.\n\nChange your mindset. Stop limiting yourself. Believe that you're in control, and no matter what problem stands in your way, you can get around it. Believe that you can and will get better.\n\nAnd remember, time is passing anyway. So you might as well start taking action, working on your goals right now.",

I prefer writing because it's the closest thing to a conversation, since i can take the time to read what i wrote and see things (hopefully) more objectively.  \nMindfulness meditation has helped me to sometimes catch myself feeling anger, self-doubt, envy, resentment etc., but what if there are issues i might have that i'm not seeing because they're not connected to a somewhat strong emotional reaction, and may be obvious to someone around me?  \nI've tried tackling some of the issues, and even though i have a rough idea of where they stem from, i don't really know how to proceed further. I'm aware that therapy would be the answer to some of my questions, and i plan to do that this summer, but i still wanna try this out for myself first. I want to metaphorically strip myself naked under bright lights, and look at the big moles I've been avoiding, without fear.  \n\n\nThank you!",

        "text": "This is a reminder to myswlf as well as others. My entire message is simple. STFU AND ACT.\n\n Whether your goal is anywhere as great as ending world hunger to something as trivial as getting up to eat breakfast. The answer to both is the same. You have to go through a PROCESS. Plan a correct course, make the preparations and then ACT. The only difference between both goals is that there is a slider of difficulty, but the basic principle holds true. Allow me to explain with an example.\n\nYou are hungry, which leaves you with a few options. You either cook for yourself, order some takeaway or have someone make it for you home cooked. Its not something you moan about because it wont make your hunger go away, you just act, plain and simple. And what are you rewarded with? a satiated stomach. No matter what the situation is, someone had to act in some sort of way for the desired result to come about. It's the same for big problems as well\n\nEffective action follows a plan. A plan forms from logical thought in aiming for a goal. The goal was set by your desire. A strong desire is the foundation for success and good habits that point you toward your goal are the building blocks. But the blueprint from day fucking one is a very simple yet profound word. GRATITUDE. Count your blessings because all of us here have a shit tonne of them we tend to forget as we act all hopeless and nihilistic \n\nGratitude you have your 5 senses. Gratitude that you are privileged enough to live in a developed country. Gratitude that you have the internet. Gratitude that you are literate enough to read what I'm writing rn. Gratitude you have fresh water to drink and hot food to eat. Gratitude everything is so convenient you can even feel depressed about the simple problems that really arent that big a deal even a week from today and countless others. This is ground zero. Anyone that truly masters gratitude will always have the clear enough conscience to grow past what limits them and never truly be depressed.\n\nExactly 0 percent of people that have ever bitched and moaned and decided to feel sorry for themselves have ever gotten their problem solved in the end without some form of action through the concious effort whether it was through themselves or someone else. Hell, something as insignificant as an itch requires you take the action (scratching your back) to remove the problem. Therefore everything imbetween your desire and taking action on your problems is a waste of precious time.\n\nThe same world that lets both rich kids inherit billions and some nameless African starve, also doesnt care whether you grow past your problems or not. We arent special and our problems arent unique. They have been solved before and can be solved again. Nothing good happens on accident. You must take ownership of your life because things won't magically change for the better out of thin air.\n\nThx for reading :)",

        "text": " Hi there,\n\nBasically, due to various layers of \"coping against nevroses I developed growing up\", I'm not that thoughtful... And I am generally ill-at-ease when others begin being thoughtful to me, too. I'd rather their not being thoughtful and not expect anything in return, but it doesn't work like that when I bond with someone new.\n\nAs a result, I'm off-mood whenever celebrations, events (a birth, a wedding), surprises or gifts are observed. Even in my professional life... I just never really feel proud of myself for anything, so work-goal-celebrations are not exciting either.\n\nOtherwise I'm generally nice, I engage in conversations, I'm regarded as a kind person, I never intentionally hurt someone, no criminal record, no heavy cheating or lying, I am there to listen to friends if they come to me with bad news and need attention. On the gift side, I'd rather pay for someone's item if they ask me to, rather than to prepare a surprise, so I wouldn't say I'm not generous. Regarding birthday cards and other consumables, I just see them as something that takes space and eventually gets thrown to the bin, so I'll say my best wishes orally if the occasion comes.\n\nThat one bit of indifference to good moments puts me apart, certain people can grow resentful. My family on my father's side has been pissed off a lot about my behaviour when I was a teenager. And I was pissed off too because, after my parent's divorce, these \\*hypocrites\\* used to hate on my mother, to wish her ill. And expected me to treat them good because they treated \\*me\\* good. That's one of the roots of my nevrose. My mother has done a number of things that became nevroses too, so she wasn't a saint either.\n\nI'm doing therapy. I am moving at a slow pace. I am not sure how to communicate to others that I still love them and to please respect how awkward I am around the fact I'm not as thoughtful as one could expect. My girlfriends asks me what I want for my birthday, I answer I want nothing. It is true, I have all what I want, is something is missing, I'll buy it. This pressure is terrible.\n\nI think the people around me could teach me how to improve, but if they teach me, and then I am thoughtful to them (who taught me), then \"it's not spontaneous anymore\", because they had to tell me, so, they won't be as pleased as if I had been thoughtful without their **prompt** in the first place... I am at loss, and obviously not very motivated for a change because of this reason.\n\nWhy do people need this thoughtfulness and the surprises to keep going in life? I don't. I'm the weird one. Sorry. If someone can offer judgement-free advice, I would appreciate it. Thanks,",

        "text": "Hello everyone! I wanted to share the past few years of my life and how i overcame my worst enemy, my self. I dont know if this will be interesting or helpfull to anybody, but it helped me a long way.\n\nTo summarise my life in the past few years. Back in 2017 (age 19) i droped out of university in pursuit of a independent income. I was a mechanical engineering student, and a good one at that. I started work as an electrical apprentice, mostly specialising in decorative lighting. The pay was fenomenal in comparison to my years. But i wanted to get my engineering degree. The plan was to work and study. But somehow i could never get those two things to work together.\n\nSome years later, i landed a job as a mechanical engineer, despite the fact i wasnt yet a certified engineer. One year into the job, i was the cheif mechanical designer and the chief of the electronics department. (due to my past experience in electronics) The pay was more than fenomenal, and could it not have been, i worked 12 to 15 hours a day.\nHowever my university task were nowhere to be found in my daily tasks.\n\nAbout here is where all the problems start to appear, my mental health went very bad, very fast. I started sleeping 25+ hours at a time. Complete blackouts. I was very depressed and unhappy. Started drinking alcohol very intensively, started smoking around 3 packs a day. But i couldnt figure out the source of my problems.\n\nThis state continued for another year, and it didnt get any better. I had more money than ever, i could aford almost anything i wanted. So i figured that the company was the problem. I swtched jobs, the other one being far less demanding. And everything seemed to be going quite okay. But after 6 months the 'blackouts' and the depression came back. I went searching for professional help, apparently i was as strong as a mule, and fit as an athlete. After reading a lot of self improvement and self insight books. I approached the problem from a different angle.\n\nTracebacking i have rooted the source of the problem the self despite of never finishing my university. A thing so simple (maybe even logical to some) but miles away from my view. It took some time to figure out, but the moment i found the problem and started to compile a solution the 'blackouts' vanished, alcohol was no more a problem, and i even had a boost of positive energy so great i quit cigarettes in a few days time.\n\nThe problem was there all along, always present, but i could not see it. The self despite and the feeling of not completing a task started back in 2015 was the distroyer of my world. Now, im back in the classroom feeling more powerfull than ever. Getting straight A results, and finishing my studies with an almost doubled pace.\n\nSorry for the long post, i hope someone gets even a little kick of motivation. My words off advice would be 'no one can help save you if you can find a way to help yourself'\n\nKeep on self improving! Dont stop trying! 😁",

        "text": "My self-improvement has been going well: I'm consistently working out, my physique is coming together nicely, i'm journaling and loving it, my mental health is in a better place, I'm reading more and I'm more confident (still lacking the passion/purpose/direction thing though) etc etc. But one thing always buggs me: relationships. \n\nI'm not going the incel route and saying it's because of \"them\" (i.e. women). Also, i'm not entirely sold that it's a me issue either. Without sucking myself off too much I'm somewhat attractive (used to do some low-level modelling), quite funny, quite smart and pretty confident. I guess I'm coming at it from a statistical level.\n\nIt hit me today. So here's the backstory. I'm 22/23 and started university again (did one degree, worked corporate for a bit, and now I'm back pursuing further studies). I've always had the mindset that \"Ah you're young, you'll find someone later\". That's how I've lived my life. Never had a relationship, never hooked up or anything (kind of). I had quite a number of girls throughout my teens/early 20s who were interested in hookups but I have/had heavy values surrounding that (they spawned from a religious POV but overtime it's just a personal thing). Anyway that's besides the point.\n\nDuring my time in college again, talking to women and guys and all, I've had the thought: \"fuck bro, if you think about it, it's HARD to find a relationship\". You need to find them attractive. They also need to be single. Then, they need to find you attractive. You need to like their personality. They need to like your personality. You need to find out if they're compatible with your values/way-of-life. They need to find out if you're compatible with your values/way-of-life. They need to tick your boxes. You need to tick their boxes. Then it comes down to if it even feels what I like to call \"soul-ties\" (you can have all of the above and still not have a deep connection). At the end, just to sprinkle more difficulty, the timing/circumstances need to be right. After I thought about it in that way, I had one of those \"fuck... this really is a mission\". It made me more anxious that I'm just never really going to find someone. Am I dumb or too bogged down into a negative frame of mind to assume the probability isn't in my favour?\n\nSometimes (emphasis on sometimes) I fucking hate myself for having my standards. However, there's no point comprising on my standards (it's not like they're highly unrealistic anyway) because a) I'll be unhappy b) which in turn, won't be fair on the other person. So that doesn't help with my above point. It just makes it even more harder.\n\nI know I'm young and I'll probably find someone down the line but I stupidly feel like it's better finding someone early on (less chance of damage on both sides, more time to grow together, less pressure of aging etc). I also know, I should focus on myself and find happiness without a partner, but we'd be lying if relationships weren't an integral part of human life.",

I make alot of mistakes and can be very clumsy in public and Ive gotten publicly humiliated alot of times for it, and it made me very self conscious.....I'm basically a pussy. Idk what to do anymore..I can't live like this anymore, I wanna do more, be better. I have no college degree and I'm just a Loser right now",

        "text": "Hi Reddit, i wanted to tell my story to you guys since I've been using reddit just to watch memes anonymously for years but today i just wanted to share my story and thank you all of you guys for making this community that made me feel better when i wasn't feeling good :)\n\nWhen I was 16, my life change a lot for the worst. My parent got divorce, and my dad was arrest and sent to jail. My little brother and I had to take care of ourselves, and we had to move to an old apartment in a dangerous part of town. We had a lot of trouble making ends meets, and it seem like thing couldn't get any worst.\n\nBut they did. One day, our apartment building caught on fire, and we lost everything. All of our clothes, picture, and memories were gone in a second. We had nothing left but each other, and it was a really hard time.\n\nI had to leave high school to work full-time and support my brother. It felt like my dream of graduating and going to college was slip away. But I didn't give up. I knew I had to keep going no matter what.\n\nOver the year, I face a lot of tough challenges. I had to work multiple jobs to make ends meets, take care of my little brother, and deal with my own mental health issues. But through it all, I never lose sight of my goal.\n\nThere were some days when I felt like giving up. I had to walk a lot of mile to work every day, in the hot sun or pouring rain. Sometimes, we would go to bed hungry because we couldn't afford groceries. But my brother and I tried to make the best of it, playing board game or reading book by candlelight.\n\nOne time, our car broke down in the middle of the highway. We were stranded for hour, with no way to call for help. But eventually, a kind stranger stopped to help us, and we made it home safely.\n\nI remember feeling so alone and scared during those early year. But I was determine to create a better life for myself and my brother. I worked hard and save every penny I could. Eventually, I was able to get us a nicer apartment in a better part of town.\n\nI never stop pursuing my education. Even though I had to leave high school, I took online classes and eventually earn my GED. I started taking classes at a local community college, and it felt like a dream come true. I was finally able to pursue my passion for writing, and I even started a blog about my experience.\n\nThere were still challenges along the way. I struggle with anxiety and depression, and sometime it felt like everything was too much to handle. But I reach out for help and found a supportive therapist who helped me work through my issue.\n\nToday, I'm proud to say that I'm a college graduate. I earn my degree in journalism from a four-year university, and I'm working as a freelance writer. I even started a non-profit organization to help other young people who are struggling to make ends meets.\n\nWhen I look back on my journey, I realize that the obstacle I faced only made me stronger. I wouldn't be where I am today if it weren't for those tough times. They taught me resilience, perseverance, and the power of hope.\n\nSo if you're reading this and you're going through a tough time, know that you're not alone. Keep fighting, keep pushing, and never lose sight of your dream. Because if I can do it, so can you :)",

I am in a relationship with my girlfriend and my anxiety coupled with my low self esteem, high weight, and her recently busy schedule which has left her less time for me has also made my relationship anxiety go off the charts. I don’t want anything special, I just want to be able to not have a deep hatred for myself and to be able to be a generally kind and well liked person. How can I start turning my life around before I ruin it all? I am scared for my mental health and how it could tank my grades and lead me to drastic measures? For context, I have no emotional connection with my family due to differences with my parents and I am seeing a weekly therapist.",

        "text": "So there were some clear issues in my failed relationship which I need to address so I've made a list on starting points. I hope I'm going to find it useful if I fall off track or feel hopeless about my power to change the things in my life.\n\n1. Sort out my issues with drinking. I need to get to a point that I can drink without reverting to an 18 year old. Find out what it is that makes me drink so heavily when I do start.\n\n2. Failing this, stop drinking. Entirely. I've had so many issues that I've created myself through my drinking and by cutting this out then maybe i can stop causing these issues.\n\n3. Issues with intimacy. Do I actually have issues that need to be sorted or do I just have a low sex drive? Why do my attitudes towards sex vary so much? What can I do to improve this? Find out how I can consistently make sex more enjoyable for myself.\n\n4. See if I just need some time to myself for a bit. Get some consistent hobbies. Meet some new friends who I actually like to spend time with. Make more of an effort with family and people already in my life. Find things I want to put my energy in to.\n\n5. Speak to a career advisor. Find out what jobs I'm best suited to and start making progress in areas I enjoy.\n\n6. Maybe speak to a therapist about my commitment issues and how to address them. Whether it's in a relationship, a job, a hobby, the gym, a friendship or sticking to a goal. Start putting in the effort to be and to stay committed to ANYTHING. Stop leaving at the first sign of not feeling up for it or for feeling a little bit bored. \n\nIt's just a bit of a ramble right now but I'm hoping I can get some answers to the questions I'm asking myself and make some changes by the end of the year. Even just looking at this one list I can already see my issues nearly all relate to commitment issues in one way or another. Hopefully I will be able to report back later with some successes.",
