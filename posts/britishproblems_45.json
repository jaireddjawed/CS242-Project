So my assumption, due to both of us being at Pepsi Marketing no less, big company, was that you knew what you were doing, but at a glance, turns out you just made the one? And some of the runs of the ad are unskippable?\"\n\n\"I did yeah.\"\n\n\"Uhhh so you didn't do. Y'know. Two for variation? Maybe make sure they're always skippable?\"\n\n\"What are you on about? It's hip with the kids and stuff you know. A Christmas rap to associate with Pepsi. Plus it being unskippable means people will be forced to watch it which they will like. Why?\"\n\n\"Well... doesn't it...\"\n\n\"Doesn't it *what*, Kevin?\"\n\n\"...make you want to gouge your eyes out and throw your laptop out a window and beat up everybody involved with making the adverts?\"\n\n\"Uh, no? I actually have three pints of Pepsi on my desk right now and I have the tune stuck in my head, I'm playing it at my daughter's wedding tomorrow as a surprise. Why?\"\n\n\"Well- it's just they're unskippable. And I ran my regular computer and I'm getting an advert every single video now. Like five seconds of the exact same noise. Just every video I go to click on now, 'DOO-DOO DWAW DWAW DWAW DOO-DOO DWAW DWAW DWAW TRADITIONAL IS SO CLICHE DIDN'T WANNA DO IT SO I SOLD MY SLEIGH AND I CAME TO SLAY NO HO HO HOE and then I go to click skip and it doesn't skip, so I threw my headphones off and broke them. Like, Dave, I may have only been in marketing for a grand total of three days, but it occurred to me at some point an hour after the first advert ran, the whole nature of only having one advert and having it be so widespread not just on YouTube but TV now, like the ubiquity of it. The constant singular advert of immediate loud, grating sound that is very clearly a disgusting monetisation of a holiday entirely about just not starving to death in cold times, isn't that kind of... y'know.\"\n\n\"Isn't it kind of *what*, Kevin?\"\n\n\"...incredibly annoying? Not in the spirit of Christmas? Clearly blatant money-grubbing? Associating Pepsi with the worst components of advertising and things like our ads being unskippable, the company trying to take rap or grime just to sell a drink that has literally nothing to do with Christmas and making some cringeworthy attempt to adopt Christmas for our money-grubbing selves and just shows we only want to appeal to people in any out-of-touch way so that we can sell?\" \n\n\"Kevin. You mean to tell me it *doesn't* make you want to drink a gallon of Pepsi a minute?\"\n\n\"No. Actually I had a thought the other day after advert fifteen in a row just trying to get through some funny YouTube videos of cats wearing Christmas hats and jumping on trees, that I wanted to punch my laptop screen, like I had the thought that I got so angry from the constant disturbances, that my first thought when Pepsi came to mind was, 'Bugger off Pepsi, the last thing I ever fucking want is to see this advert again'. I actually went out to buy a bunch of coke instead, Dave.\"\n\n\"Wha- you mean that thing I've been snorting?! I pay you enough to have some?!\"\n\n\"No- Coca-Cola, our biggest competitor? I just had this thought while the advert ran that in protest, people should stop buying Pepsi, especially Pepsi Max, and maybe buy more Coca-Cola until the adverts stop. Just a thought I had between bouts of DOO-DOO DWAW DWAW DWAW DOO-DOO DWAWDWAW DWAW TRADITIONAL IS SO CLICHE, DIDN'T WANNA DO IT SO I SOLD MY SLEIGH AND I CAME TO SLAY NO HO HO HOOOOOE- y'know?\"\n\n\"I don't know what you're talking about. Put in twenty more orders of unskippable months of that one song I love it. Can't get enough.\"\n\n\"Outside of Christmas? Yeah I'm sure they'll love that- so you *seriously* think people aren't now hating Pepsi for making this?\"\n\n\"I- I think I've made it clear I love the advert. Also you're fired, you're old. Antiquated.\"\n\n\"What? How so. Why?\"\n\n\"TRADITIONAL IS SO CLICHE, DIDN'T WANNA DO IT SO I SOLD MY SLEIGH AND I CAME TO SLAY NO HO HO HO-\"",
