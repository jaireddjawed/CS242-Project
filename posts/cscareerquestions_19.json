        "text": "There is one skill that I personally feel is undervalued in programming and ignored by novice programmers, and that is the ability to create things without knowing how to do them. When you are just starting out, you are taught the basics and how to do this or that, but when you face more advanced challenges with bigger needs, you realize that sometimes you don't know how to satisfy the requirements of that problem you have. Tools like ChatGPT or You can help clarify precise doubts, but in themselves do not stop making the research process overwhelming and, finally, they just make you dependent on them, which makes life very complicated when you have a problem that they do not know how to help you. My question is: how do those programmers who are constantly creating things that they didn't know how to do at the beginning? and how do they work to identify those requirements and problems that they must take into account to finally develop their software?",

I travelled back in to my home country in December with a return ticket booked in January. While I was here, I was diagnosed with a medical condition and my doctors told me that I will require a procedure. He mentioned that I won’t be able to travel after the procedure and I need it urgently, stating that I should postpone my travel. I notified the same to my company and they asked for medical documents, which I sent them. I then asked them if it is okay for me to stay and get the surgery done here or should I travel back, explaining them the entire timeline. They told me that it’s fine. So I stayed back. I travelled to my home country on temporary visa because I still wasn’t allotted the work permit. I told my organisation that I will have to extend my visa and then I will get the surgery done. Since, it would have introduced more complexity if the return visa expired. I told them that visa extension will obviously take some time. After having all the information they told me it’s okay you can stay. I am working regularly all this time. I applied for the visa extension from my home country and it took around 20 days. Meanwhile, I was on medications. During this time the top most guy in my team who is one up from my immediate boss, let’s call him Robert. Robert asked my lead to contact me and ask me why haven’t I started the surgery yet. I told my lead that I mentioned before seeking the approval to stay that I will get the visa extension first and then surgery, and as mentioned extension is taking some time. So, my lead told me that Robert wants me to fly back as soon as I get the visa. I talked to one of my colleague to understand what’s going on and told me that Robert googled my condition and thinks that I am lying, the procedure doesn’t take so long. I thought that if he has this sort of trust issues, it’s better I go back and get the procedure done there. So, I start looking for tickets and the immediate return tickets are filthy expensive. I asked my lead that is it okay if I wait and get the cheaper tickets. He replied, ‘Robert said they you must come as soon as possible, and he is really annoyed with the whole situation’. \n\nSo, this is the point where I became really furious. This statement implies that the management is totally inconsiderate and isn’t accepting that it is there mistake at all. They shouldn’t have allowed my stay if they have such insecurities. Robert is annoyed at me rather than considering the fact that I asked twice before deciding to stay. Now just because you think I am lying ( based on google information) I should spend a huge some of my money to get back immediately ? And it’s not like you are saying that in a considerate manner, you are being a complete asshole as if I am your slave. \n\n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I being too sensitive?",

        "text": "Hi everyone. \n\nAs the title says, I'm looking to break into tech. For the past 2 and a bit years I have been working mostly with microscopes in a Contract Research Organization (we do the data collection and analysis for clinical trials from Biotechs). This is my first job after graduating in 2020 with my Masters in Biotech and was meant to be a transitional job (my 2 year anniversary there was at the start of November) so at this point I am trying to get out, and living in a HCOL city I would love the opportunity to WFH / hybrid too.\n\nDuring this time, I used the little coding knowledge I had to make some applications in Python to automate otherwise manual tasks. I find making these apps really enjoyable and would like to continue doing this as work. As a few examples of what I've made: \n\n1. An image manipulation app using Pillow to convert the thousands of images I take from a clinical trial and create composites out of them for quick visual representation of treatment efficacy. You select the folder with the raw images, and the app will automatically resize them, create a template and populate it with information (target protein, days post treatment, patient info) and then add the images and export these composites to a new folder.\n2. A dashboard through Shiny (the Biostats team works with R so I used something they're familiar with) that accepts an excel sheet of genes of interest for a study and scrapes NCBI and Pubmed for gene information / summaries and related articles based on keywords of interest. The dashboard allows them to search the different databases on NCBI and select articles of interest to be exported to an excel sheet for later reading. This has gotten me some free lunches from the med students :)\n3. I was put in charge of our AWS system (S3, IAM, etc) because I am now the \"tech guy\" after the person who was handling it before left in less than amicable circumstances. Besides managing it, I made an app with Boto3 to act as a search filter to populate our databases with file locations because we're trying to organize over 5 years of project files and data and AWS lacks a good search filter aside from prefixes. Basically it just iterates over all the buckets and spits out file paths for either exact filename matches (if trying to locate old project information) or keywords of interest (to see what we actually have). It can also sync to our database and populate empty fields if it sees that a file does not have an associated filepath.\n\nI haven't really had a chance to work with Data Analysis (since we have a dedicated Biostats team), but I am capable of utilizing Pandas and MatPlotLib as part of the webscraping and information gathering apps I made, and I have been learning machine learning in Scikit-learn and TensorFlow through Kaggle for fun. I also have experience with HTML and CSS, which helps a ton in my Collab / Juypter notebooks, as well as SQL (but I don't really use it much).  I've done projects on freeCodeCamp and Hackerrank as practice too.\n\nThe crux of my question is how should I leverage this kind of experience to break into tech? I haven't actually applied for any pure-tech positions as I don't feel confident that I would be competitive, but I have applied and had some interviews with tech-adjacent positions within healthcare and research such as an automation specialist and a drug discovery operations associate that I am waiting to hear back from. I figured my best bet was to get into these positions and continue building apps to help out. I haven't had any luck with any Data Analysis positions, because all the ones I apply for already want experience. Do I have enough experience to work in jobs that utilize Python, or what should I do to become a viable candidate? \n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated, and I'm happy to provide clarification as needed.",

I hear that Junior dev and PM salaries are similar.\n\nKnowledge base mainly focuses around  Python 3, JavaScript ES6+, SQL, HTML5, CSS, Django, React, and MongoDB.\n\nI know it's pretty general question but would love any input.

If this resume still doesn't work, I need to look for unpaid work to stay legal or be forced to return home and throw US diploma in the garbage can :(.\n\nFor additional context: My previous internship-turned-full-time offer was rescinded during layoff in December and I have been job searching since. I have been looking at previous suggestions in this sub on other people's resume for a while now, and everybody seems to be suggesting the right, helpful, but sometimes conflicting thing, for example: describe more impact, add more metrics, be shorter, etc. But I tried them all and they never worked in my favor. In my previous resumes I tried many different approaches, for exaple:\n\n1. literally painting my bullet points with positive performance impact and statistics, in reality, I simply didn't get any statistical feedback during the short internship, and I had to make them up(result: received almost same-day rejections for this version)\n2. simple one liner describing my work as if talking to someone who doesn't understand CS, (heard many people saying that recruiters don't know CS very well and need you to tell them what it means, result: no one reached back to me)\n\nAfter seeing no improvement at all, I had to resort to my final edition of this version, in this version, I kept everything as practical, as detailed, and with as many \"authentic\" metrics as I can have without obviously blowing smokes, yet also as precise as I can be (every bullet points within two lines) I took other professional suggestions on ADP list to put education and GPA on top to signal my new grad status, to highlight my roles over companies I worked at, to list keyword skill sets. I got rid of every other experience (I have a ton of other mixed full stack utilities experinece using other languages) that doesn't have anything to do with \"Python\" or \"backend\", I revised the layout to leave some space around the resume, changed fonts, I took the advice to only show \"three most important projects\".\n\nPlease let me know if this at least deserves some interview, I don't even ask much, I applied to startups with as few people as 10 as well as mega techs. I answered yes to all relocation and said yes to all onsite, remote, hybrid opportunities. I tried Linkedin, Indeed, angelist, Ripple Match, handshakes. This is my last fight with my resume, any more metrics this will be fake and any more impact will be made up, I wrote what I did with accurate technical terms. I am out of tricks.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/xQnmgsk](https://imgur.com/a/xQnmgsk)",

Are they friendly about hinting you along without viewing it as disqualifying, or do they sit and total silence and mark you for death if you get stuck for 30 pico seconds? i dunno, but its some bullshit i'll tell you what. I don't get how this even helps them find a good candidate? Far more likely than not, they just get someone that studied the right thing before hand\n\nAt least if we new in advance what algorithms or concepts (like design patterns) they can see if 1) the candidate was serious enough to prepare and 2) the candidate has some actual understanding\n\nif nothing else, its the absolute worst when you get floored with some kind of question you have no clue how to solve, and get stuck with someone that just sits in silence for 30 minutes. often I don't even have anxiety about not getting the job, i'm fine with that, but its being embarrassed that makes me nervous. like, no truly, i've been an engineer at a faang for 4 years, I promise I'm not a complete idiot just because this prompt has stumped me T_T",

All of my previous companies were no name or non technical companies(banks, health care, etc) up to the summer of 2021.\n\nIn the summer of 2021 I switched jobs to a SaaS company and got laid off with many others in the summer of 2022. Being risk averse even though I have savings and clearly seeing the job market getting worse at the time, I got another job in the fall of 2022 at another pure tech company. I was just let go along with many others at the start of the month.\n\nThe old me playing defensively would say, try to land another position and ride it out. Do not make any demands, take a pay cut if you have to. Keep your head down and work hard. However I am now questioning if that is the right approach. The last 2 jobs I held I did well, no issues with performance and the team liked me. I was still let go.\n\nClearly there is no job security, so if I land another position why should I not immediately start pushing the limits of what the company is willing to tolerate? I am talking about getting my machine and on the weekend flying straight to Europe to work remotely which is something I have always wanted to do(I am fully remote only now).\n\nIf I am going to get fired, I am thinking I should at least enjoy life and live on my terms. Maybe I never get fired for working overseas. If I do get fired, I will just start looking again. If my next job stint is short(&lt; 6 months) because I got fired for working out of country, I might just leave it off the resume. Obviously the compensation matters, if the next job is at FAANG with good pay I will not risk it. If it is another no name company with mediocre pay, I will do this. I will repeat until I get a position with compensation I will not risk, go fully global remote(contracting?), or I run out of savings, or just get bored with Europe.\n\nWhile I am open to all opinions, I would really like to hear from hiring managers about their thoughts on candidates who have had multiple short term jobs or gaps if I decide to go forward with this. I would also really like to hear from people who lived through the dot com bubble(2000-2003) and their experience in 2004-2005 applying for positions if unsteady employment hurt them.",

        "text": "Hi. I am in the second year of a data science and stats master's degree program in the U.S. I just accepted an offer for a 6-month data engineering co-op at a large pharma company. Where I live on the East Coast, we have a very large pharma company presence and a large proportion of my school's grads go into statistics or data science jobs in the pharma industry.\n\nThe co-op will start in April and is 35 hrs/week and I can continue as a part time grad student at night. The pay is not good for a graduate co-op($30/hr), but it is a well known company in the industry. The company gets good reviews on Glassdoor and I liked the people I interviewed with.\n\nI am concerned though, if this is a good co-op for my career.  It almost seemed too easy to get.  It makes me worried that perhaps this is a pretty undesirable co-op that almost no one applies for. I got a one-hour Zoom interview with the guy who will be my team lead two weeks after applying online. The online assessment before the interview was basically all behavioral questions. The interview itself was behavioral and technical. The technical question portion of the interview was very high level and honestly pretty simple questions about how you might deal with cleaning and processing datasets and very general questions about good programming practice. I liked the guy I interviewed with and thought we had a good rapport, though.  I got the offer just a few days after interviewing.\n\nAll I really know about the job is that it involves setting up data pipelines for processing data about drug development. The only concrete skills they mentioned in the job description were they want some knowledge of SQL and other high level languages commonly used in data science - like R and Python.  I like data science and statistics and I certainly enjoyed working with R, Python, and SQL in my masters program.  However, data engineering seems like it's a complimentary field to data science and less about analysis and more about infrastructure.  I'm just not sure if I will like it or not.  I'm just not totally sure what data engineering is like or what the general outlook for the field is.  If I don't quite like it, can I still apply for data science jobs when I finish the co-op?  I'm also nervous that the technologies they use might be very niche and the skills not very transferrable to other industries/companies.\n\nDoes anyone who works in a similar field have any thoughts about what this work might be like?  During the interview, the interviewer had to ask from a very specific list of questions and I really didn't have any time to ask him about the specific technologies and processes that will be used in the job.  I only had a few days to decide whether to take the position and I couldn't get that much information about the job.\n\nI was very nervous I wouldn't get any other co-op or intern chances because of the job market and my own background.  I'm a career changer and much older than your typical grad student.  My grad school grades are good (4.0 GPA), but my work background is not great - I have lots of resume gaps and work in non-tech fields.\n\nThe funny thing is that almost as soon I accepted the offer, I started getting lots of interview chances at other internships/co-ops I applied for for Summer 2023.\n\nDoes anyone have any thoughts on whether I made a good decision or not?  I know this could be problematic, but I imagine I could keep interviewing for internships and then if I find something else just tell this pharma company I am no longer interested in the co-op.",

Unfortunately, mobile doesn't get as much work as other departments. It's slow compared to others, but when it comes, it's tedious.\n\nSo, come today, my manager decides to switch teams and go into web development because they need more help. Says it's slow in mobile anyways and tells me that I'm the primary mobile developer and said he'd help with consulting in future. My understanding is that he'd be busy in the coming months to help me with anything.\n\nI'm an intermediate developer so not having a senior role is not good for my growth. And I'm taken aback by this decision. I feel abandoned in a role I am not ready for.\nI was nice and agreeable when he told me this and I process emotions late but now in retrospect I don't feel great.\n\nI wanted to ask if I am being illogical here.

Thinking about what the time and cost may be to transition. No experience with coding by the way but I am very scientifically literate/educated. I love logic and efficiency and trying to make everything as efficient as possible.\n\nWould I need another degree? Bootcamp an option? Would I have to start out at a low salary like 50k?
