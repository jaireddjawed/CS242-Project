All these take place in the real physical world, and the real world is a chaotic mess. The cost of building an robot is insanely prohibitive and they are still limited  to specific tasks, while humans on the other hand are versatile. Humans  can juggle different tasks and adapt quickly to changes in environments.\n\nThe jobs that AI will take are the white collars one. This is because these jobs do not require physical interaction, and it is far easier to train an AI model than it is to create a robot. We can already infer this from the capabilities of models like GPT-4 and Midjourney-5. We can only imagine the capabilities 10 years from know\n\nEven from a capitalist perspective this makes sense. Fire the programmer, artist and managers. They cost too much and AI can do a better job them anyway. But what incentive is there to fire the humble electrician or the painter or the fast-food joint worker? In the future job market, one task specific robot years might be worth 10 versatile humans. This also ensures that the economy does not collapse due to lack  of consumers and the overlords get to keep the working class under them.\n\nScientists and researchers might be safe though.",

Is there any rule around people claiming that a pure ai generated work is human generated. Lets say, I voice clone someone else and claim it as my real voice, I generated a whole book and say that I wrote it in years, I generated a drawing and say that I draw it by hands. In my understanding, there is no legal or social obligation at the moment for anyone to specify if something is generated or not. People can claim whatever they want and without good detection tech at somepoint nobody is going to tell if something is real or not. How is this not a huge threat to our society, stripping away the very human part of us. Some people might say that they dont care if all the things they see online and people they interact are faked, but I absolutely do care. I am genuinely scared about the implication it is going to bring to our world. Correct me if Im wrong but there is  no rule atm against people who deliberately faking ai as human.

That's how AI learns as well, only it does a billion tries in a matter of seconds, in a manner of speaking.\n\nSo what does it mean, well it means incredible problem solving capability. You can ask but what if we have this or that problem, well we can just feed it back to AI.\n\nThe greatest fear is that AI will get conscious, but what is consciousness. AI can already reason and learn, it's just going to get better at that. It doesn't matter that it is incredibly smart, it doesn't have a heart.\n\nThat may sound heartless, but it isn't, you're not looking at your calculator and wonder what it feels, or are worried it's going to get irritated because you still don't know how to calculate the square root of a number.\n\nBut we do have the same magic of what a calculator is to numbers for pretty much any problem now, the real danger is if we're just going to use it to generate money, then we might end up generating a lot of the problems that correlate with making large scale profits.",

Like, will we ever have a legit crystal ball that we can carry around in our pockets and be all like, \"Yo, AI, tell me what's gonna happen next!\"\n\nNow, I know what you're thinking. This sounds like some sci-fi ish, right? Like something out of Minority Report or Blade Runner or some other futuristic flick. But hear me out, y'all. With all the advancements in machine learning and data analysis, it's not completely impossible.\n\nSure, there are some ethical dilemmas to consider, like whether we should even be messing with predicting individual futures. But let's set that aside for a sec and just imagine what life would be like if we all had crystal balls. Would we be more chill and laid back, knowing exactly what's gonna happen next? Or would we freak out and be all paranoid about changing our fate?\n\nPersonally, I think it would be both rad and trippy AF. I mean, imagine walking down the street and your crystal ball starts glowing and beeping, telling you to turn left instead of right. And then BAM, you avoid getting hit by a flying car or something (because, you know, we'll all be zipping around in flying cars by then).\n\nBut on the other hand, I don't know if I wanna live in a world where everything is predetermined. Like, where's the thrill of the unknown, you know? Plus, what if the AI messes up and gives you a false prediction? Do you sue the robot for emotional distress?\n\nSo, I'm curious, my fellow humans and other beings. What do you think about this whole crystal ball future prediction thing? Are you down with it, or are you like, nah, I'll just take my chances and roll with the punches? Let's chat!",

As someone who wants to go to grad school for this stuff, I know that AI is being incorporated into a lot of technology such as chord identification, but I suppose this product is a bit closer to the creative side of things. I know everyone is talking about AI and art, but does anyone have a guess as to what this would look like for the music industry? Curious to know what you all think.",

Aside from Judaism, the “good ending” in major world religions consists of an escape at death from mundane reality, either into a paradise (Christianity and Islam) or into a state outside the circle of life (Hinduism, Buddhism, and their relatives). Today, most people either believe in such an escape or have ancestors that believed in it. Although evidence for Heaven or Nirvana is lacking (no the grunge band doesn’t count), we have or are approaching the possibility of transcending or at least radically expanding the limits of experience through technology, and we should embrace the possibilities it opens. If we can’t have a paradise (or even a frontier to explore) in the natural world, we should embrace the possibility of having one in an artificial world and using the natural world to sustain it.",

GPT-4, a multimodal AI that can handle text and image prompts and apparently can perform about as well as a high school student in many tasks, with a response time of seconds;\n\n3. AI Speech to text to convert, to convert human voice commands from a robot's microphone into a prompt for GPT-4;\n\n4. Tortoise-TTS or other proprietary text to speech engine like Elevenlabs to synthetize the robot’s answers in realistic human speech.\n\n... what’s stopping a research team from crudely assembling these technologies together and giving a multimodal LLM a repeating simple prompt on a 1 second timer such as “What should a good robot assistant do and say in this situation?”, appending photos and any speech-to-text from the microphones of the robots’ surrounding to the prompt as context?  Wouldn't this essentially amount to somewhat intelligent, if low \"mental framerate\", scifi robot?    \n\n\nEssentially, are we there yet?",

        "text": " \n\nForegen is a non-profit organization that aims to develop innovative non-surgical methods for restoring the foreskin. Male circumcision, which involves the removal of the foreskin, is a common practice in many cultures and religions around the world. However, it can lead to physical, sexual, and psychological complications, including decreased sensitivity, scarring, and trauma. Foregen's goal is to provide a safe and effective way for men who have undergone circumcision to regain their foreskin and restore their sexual function.\n\nForegen's research is based on the idea of tissue engineering, which involves growing human tissues in the laboratory and transplanting them back into the body. The organization has already made significant progress in this area, and has successfully grown foreskin tissue in the laboratory using stem cells. The next step is to develop a surgical technique for transplanting this tissue back onto the penis.\n\nForegen's work is important not only for men who have undergone circumcision, but also for promoting ethical standards in medicine and advocating for genital autonomy. The organization believes that genital cutting should be a personal choice made by individuals themselves, rather than being forced on them by cultural or religious traditions.\n\nForegen is a promising example of the potential of science and technology to bring about positive change and improve people's lives. As their research continues, they are bringing hope to men who have undergone circumcision and promoting a more ethical and compassionate approach to healthcare.",
