It is quite unmotivating and depressing. I also don't find any merit now in pursuing goals i had before knowing about determinism. Before i was happy reaching a goal i worked for for months, now i'm like yeah it was predetermined anyways and my efforts are not really efforts but just theoretically predictible efforts.  \n\nThis belongs to the discussions about moral responsibility in a deterministic world. I didn't find any compatibilist litterature that adress specifically my concern: can i shape my future or is it all determined? All what compatibilists did is just playing on words and definitions to make free will and determinism compatible. Frankfort's case only shows that someone can have free will even when not having the capacity to do otherwise, and this is just a play on one of free will's definitions. In my specific case it is basically telling me i have free will to be a loser, but can i change the course of actions with my agency? Through things like discipline?",

Google translate says the word condemn means denounce (and some other words but i assume this is the best alternative word for this sentence) but it also means to sentence. Is this some very smart wordplay that uses both of its meanings at once? Like man is sentenced to be free. Even if he were to fully stop thinking and completely obey someone else, he still bears the responsibility for his actions? Even if you are a soldier, you technically have your own free will and you bear responsibility for the lives you took. At this point i am aware that whoever said this probably didnt mean it like that but i kind of want it to have that meaning too. Your thoughts?",

For example, it is not possible to disprove the possibility that there are invisible pink fairies at this moment circling the planet Pluto, but we don’t countenance it as a real possibility because there is no evidence for their planetary activities. This is not to be thought of as a matter of faith, but of sound reasoning. But asserting that atheism is a faith just like any other, because it is not possible to prove the non-existence of God contradicts this principle. It replaces the principle 'in the absence of good grounds for believing something, it is not rational to believe it' with the principle, 'in the absence of good grounds for believing something, it requires faith not to believe it'. For this reason, atheism is not a matter of faith in the same way as belief in God. In short, belief without evidence (a form of faith) is not the same as non-belief due to lack of evidence (rational refusal to assent).\"\n\nI consider myself agnostic and I'm not really grasping the contradiction here.

We met each other when we started university. Anyways, in the first semester of first year we liked the same girl. We both proposed and we both got rejected. In the second semester of that first year my friend started dating this girl. I wasn't envious or anything and I truly desired them the best. I was a very good friend with this girl and honestly, she made me overcome my depression of second year because she herself went through one in her adolescence (which I believe is the main reason why she is incredibly mature emotionally). In third year they broke up and she completely changed. She was dull and unhappy in many times of the relationship and soon after they broke up her face lighted up again and was the girl I originally met in that first year. Because of this my feelings started to change again and I got truly truly madly in love with her. I ended up confessing and proposing only to get rejected (which is what I was expecting anyways). There were some intense conversations and experiences in this process, but I won't detail everything as it'd be too long. We ended up being friends just like always, which I love because I definitely want her in my life and I want to be in her's. Anyways, I only told my friend about this after I proposed and he considered this to be treason and ended our friendship. Frankly, I was so in love and I loved her so deeply that even if a \"no\" was the expected answer I wanted to stay true to myself and do it anyways. I did think on how this could affect my friend before doing it, but I decided to simply do it thinking only about myself (I know this could be considered selfish, but many times in my life I haven't done things because of other people). He insisted that I should have at least informed him before doing it, but I genuinely don't think that's the case. I don't think I have done it wrong, I simply stayed true to my emotions and only thought about myself. I want to hear what other people think as I can be wrong, but I genuinely don't see how this could be considered betrayal.\n\nI have the feeling that this has been a moral clash of some kind, but I really want to hear genuine feedback on this.",

        "text": "I am having a hard time locating any videos or articles discussing the role of \"consent\" in hard determinism (NFW) and would appreciate any information anyone can provide to resources around this topic.  \n\n\nBasically, here is the concept I having a hard time building out:  \nGenerally, many of our laws and rules are based on the concept of informed consent.  For example, even in the not that controversial world of using a social media website like Reddit, there is a little consent popup that you \"must\" agree to in order to use the site.    \n\n\nSetting aside whether a consent can be valid if you have no way of getting what you want without giving that consent (is it really volitional if you have no bargaining power) or whether a consent can be valid if you have no idea what you are actually agreeing to (can consent be valid without understanding the information), determinism introduces a much bigger problem.  If all human activity is \"caused\" that would include the action of signing a consent.  There are a ton of events before a consent is presented that have in effect assured that the actor will or will not sign the consent.  Those events are causal.    \n\n\nSo, what a signed consent is really measuring is not the \"autonomy\" of the signer, but rather the efficacy of the presenter in shaping the mental landscape of the signer such that consent will be assured.    \n\n\nYou don't need to be a believer in NFW to see how this works in real time - there are countless trainings around how to convince a reluctant patient to sign a consent to release their information or consent to treatment.  Often dubbed \"motivational interviewing\" these social work techniques shift people's mental state to the point where you can then act in their best interest without objection.   So that \"consent\" does not serve as evidence of the autonomous decision making capacity of the patient - rather it serves as evidence that the people working the patient were very good at causal manipulation.    \n\n\nThis basic issue arises in more or less every area where we declare consent as a fundamental pre-requisite to legality-ethical behavior.  \"Age of consent\", \"consents being only valid if the signer is not intoxicated\", etc. all start to look very different under this light.    \n\n\nAny direction to further discussion of this topic would be greatly appreciated.",

These responses have given somewhat comforting reasons why innocent humans suffer due to natural or man-made evils. \n\nAfter thinking about it for a while, it seems that the soul building theodicy assumes an afterlife is real. To me this seems like the argument is attempting to defend the claim that a three-Os God is real by claiming that an afterlife similar to the Christian conceived version of heaven is also real. I've got a very basic understanding of the theodicies, but from what I've read, it seems that they are supposed to be a logically consistent story that gives reason why a three-Os god would be consistent with evil. In this case it seems we are attempting to show one unproveable thing is real (God) by reasoning about another unproveable thing (an afterlife).",

And so we can't really Know anything (beyond tautology). And I can understand why that would be an uncomfortable conclusion, but it still seems correct to me. My feeling is, 'Turns out observational 'knowledge' is actually demoted to 'speculation with fancy nametag.' Oh well? Thanks to Gettier we should already be hedging our bets when pointing to shit and saying we Know what it is. And as that implies, the disconnect from indirect realism doesn't mean we have to start stepping in front of cars or whatever, it just means we take a slightly more humble view and don't claim 100% certainty of ideas that are based on external objects.

        "text": "I am a young western european guy that recently started some communication studies, in which I've had philosophy classes. I am deeply atheist. But here is my wonder...\n\nWhy is it the case that none of those philosophers (I am thinking about Pascal and Kant) could just simply imagine that God could not exist ? Those guys have that ability of putting into perspective everything they see, to the point of wondering if the people they see walking in the streets are real people. So what about God ? Why is there no sane criticism about its own existence ?\n\nPascal's bet is interesting and even managed to make me wonder if I shouldn't start believing in God, since that's the always winning scenario. But this wager has a very important flaw for me: it takes the existence of a god for granted and universal, intrinsic to the very reason for our existence. It is more important to me to first prove the existence of God than to speculate on how one would have to live if a God ever existed.\n\nIf I invent a divine steward whose existence no one can know because it is a pure invention, if I manage to convince a large group of people that this steward exists, what would be the interest for totally outside and foreign people for this deity to consider scenarios of how to live depending on that totally invented deity's existence ?\n\nTo put into another perspective, I am as I said atheist, but I do wonder why every single community in the world and in the time ALWAYS, 100% of the time, believe in something irrational. Why did humanity evolve about something it did not even see once, nor did it see its action once either. How can one be so deeply conviced that thing exists.\n\nIt might sound very selfish, but if I can live a normal life without believing in anything, why could noone else do that in the past as well ?\n\nWhen we studied Socrates it blowed my mind, because this guy lived 2000 years ago, and his philosphy and his way of thinking is like he wrote that yesterday.\n\nI understand that for a long time, noone could read, there was no education, relgion was in the center of everything, therefore it is easier for one to believe in irrational stuff. But if Socrates's logic is still so logical today, it means that anyone could also think \"straight\" during all that time, during all those 2000 years.\n\nSorry if all of this is a bit confused, English isn't my native language and those are not easy concepts to explain. Have a nice day !",

A lung cell want to pass oxygen and does hemoglobin want to carry it? \nDoes a proton want to combine with an electron?\nThis may seem silly but I think it's important for the concept of purpose of humans. It's often considered a dirty word, but if most people agree a lung cell has a purpose, and if that purpose is incurred by it doing what it wants, then humans too can have a purpose by doing what they want.",

        "text": "I just watched the Michael Sugrue lecture on YouTube on the phenomenology of geist and I don't understand why does it all have to be so mystical. \nI understand he's looking at the history of philosophy which with the classics was mystical and before the Renaissance was mostly theology. Also this is before Comte and modern sociology. So why can't we take old philosophy, apply modern science methods and disentangle things so it can be explained easily to a modern person. \n\nSo with the idea of geist. It's said with the downfall of kant's thing in itself we end up without a world to know and just a subjective interpretation. Then comes Hegel and tries to solve this with an objective rational geist. Can this be there is no objective forms and definitions but rather we as a society collectively define things like what a woman is? So there is no definition of woman as according to culture we can change definitions and make it so a man can become a woman?\n\nThen comes the rest, the geist tries to know itself. It goes through phases (family, state, as well as art and philosophy) all of which is human culture. And then it accomplishes becoming self conscious which we could theoretically do by realizing our position in history and bringing about the end of history. So, I don't know, no borders, no inequality, just one humanity. Maybe marx does this.\n\nSo the question is twofold. Can we today understand Hegel better than he did himself? And maybe also, can we say philosophy is not so mystical anymore as the zeitgeist is more secular today.",
