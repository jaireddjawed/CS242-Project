An FBI agent got out of the car.\n\n\"Are you little Johnny?\"\n\n\"Yessir.\"\n\n\"I'm here to investigate a murder. Someone was killed down the road, you mind if I take a peek around your property for some evidence?\"\n\n\"I don't mind at all! But, just don't go into that field over there.\"\n\nThe FBI agent whips out his badge. \n\n\"You see this? This means I can go wherever I want!\"\n\n\"All right! Go ahead!\"\n\nA little bit later, Johnny is doing his chores. Suddenly he hears a commotion. Its the agent! He had gone into the field and a bull was chasing him, practically right behind the agent!\"\n\n\"JOHNNY, JOHNNY! DO SOMETHING!\"\n\nLittle Johnny shouts back:\n\n\"SHOW HIM THE FUCKING BADGE!\"",
