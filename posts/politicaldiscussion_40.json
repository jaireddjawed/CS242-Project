If the president is doing well, the president's party will do well, and vice versa.\n\nHowever, midterms can also be analyzed individually on their own terms. taking local issues into consideration along with attributes of the specific candidates who are running. From this perspective, the national results of the midterm elections are an aggregate of dozens of smaller elections, in which perception of the president is only one factor.\n\nWhich of these ways of looking at the midterm elections more accurately reflects the reality of the political dynamics? Do the more granular considerations of individual races more or less even out on the national level, allowing the aggregate to be used as a proxy for national sentiment regarding the current presidential administration? Are there just too many complicating variables to view the midterm elections as more than just a bunch of individual elections that happen to take place at the same time? Or if the answer is somewhere in between, to what extent is each interpretation useful and/or accurate?",

        "title": "Senate candidates like Phil Bredesen have openly denounced the national Democratic party during their campaigns. Could we be seeing the resurgence of conservative Democrats? How will that play out with the base, which is growing increasingly liberal?",

        "text": "[Inspired by the following article:](https://www.yahoo.com/news/tenn-democrat-aims-senate-win-edging-away-party-122330489--election.html)\n\n&gt;NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Phil Bredesen is a Democrat. But he'd rather you not mention that.\n\n&gt;\"I need to make clear to everybody my independence from all of the national Democratic stuff,\" said Bredesen, the former two-term governor of Tennessee who is now running for the U.S. Senate.\n\n&gt;So far, his strategy appears to be working. According to internal polling by both parties, Bredesen has a narrow lead over Republican Rep. Marsha Blackburn in a state that President Donald Trump won by 26 points, and capturing the open seat would strengthen Democrats' chances of taking back control of the Senate in the November elections.\n\n&gt;Bredesen, a 74-year-old white man, is an unlikely vessel for the hopes of a national party increasingly reliant on younger voters, women and minorities — and nominating more candidates that fit that same profile. He says Democrats wouldn't be able to reliably count on his vote in the Senate, and foresees playing a role like that of Maine Sen. Susan Collins, who has broken with the GOP on several high-profile issues.\n\n&gt;\"I think you can be influential being in that swing position,\" Bredesen said during an interview this past week in his campaign office in Nashville's West End neighborhood.\n\n&gt;Bredesen represents the irony facing Democrats this fall. The party is moving to the left but its prospects of regaining the Senate hinge on decidedly moderate candidates running in states Trump carried by a wide margin.\n\n&gt;With just over six weeks until Election Day, one of Bredesen's biggest challenges may be divorcing his race from Democrats' overall Senate chances.\n\n&gt;\"A lot of conservatives in Tennessee really like Phil Bredesen and really don't want (New York Democratic Sen.) Chuck Schumer to be majority leader,\" said Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster. \"How they wrestle with that tension likely determines the outcome of the Senate race.\"\n\nBredesen is not the only Democratic candidate who has exclusively campaigned on being a moderate (and sometimes, an outright conservative). Across the Midwest and South, Senate and House candidates have been explicitly positioning themselves away from the national party.\n\n[For example, at least 20 Democratic candidates for the House](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/06/20/pelosi-democrats-candidates-midterms-655484) - including Conor Lamb who won a stunning upset a few months ago - have vowed to not vote for Nancy Pelosi as Speaker. If the House becomes blue but narrowly, this could pose a problem if they join Republicans in voting down Pelosi's nomination.\n\nCould we be seeing a resurgence of a strong conservative Democratic bloc within the party? The [blue dog Democrats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Dog_Coalition) are famous for being the most outspoken conservative wing of the party, but their numbers have shrunk - recently to only 15 members. With the coming election, could this become a significant faction?\n\nAnd finally, how will this play out with the base of the party? According to national polls, the Democratic base is growing increasingly leftwing. [A majority of Democrats now say they support socialism in the US](https://news.gallup.com/poll/240725/democrats-positive-socialism-capitalism.aspx), to name just one example. How well will these two factions negotiate with each other under the big tent of the party?",
