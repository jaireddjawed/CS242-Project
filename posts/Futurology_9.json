        "text": "Many of you have probably noticed that social media algorithms are designed in such a way that passively skews toward things that release maximum amounts of dopamine. Oftentimes those are funny but stupid memes, soft pornography, or emotionally charged political content. \n\nUnfortunately, this means that people who are actually taking action on doing awesome things for the world are left out of sight amidst the meaningless noise. This phenomenon is important to be aware of going into the future because even now I am starting to see lots of uninspired, non-passionate, and nihilistic people. What is shown is not reality but people take it as such, especially the impressionable youth. In reality, there is a plethora of amazing people working on doing awesome things and working on solutions to the world's toughest problems. This idea was also mentioned in terms of climate change by u/civilrunner in his earlier thread but this extends to so many other fields.\n\nNow, I am not here to just state the problem, I would like to actually work on solutions. Some people already making progress in this field are Veritasium, Quanta Magazine, VSauce, Sci-Show, and other similar YouTube channels. They are actively bringing out interesting topics and people into the light of the public.  \n\nThe real question is how do we get this type of content to the maximum number of people? keeping in mind that the algorithms are not in our favor on this one.\n\nIf we are to move towards a bright future we need to address this problem. I would love to hear your thoughts and potential solutions.\n\nI am currently working on a project at my university to tackle this challenge, if anyone is interested I can share it in a future post!",

        "text": "[The 6 worst college majors to choose if you want to make a lot of money in your first job, from psychology to hospitality](https://www.businessinsider.com/worst-paying-college-majors-after-graduation-list-2023-2)\n\n&gt;The New York Federal Reserve found the six lowest-paying majors fell under social sciences and liberal arts. In comparison, the highest-paying majors were all in STEM industries, which include careers in science, technology, engineering, and math. Notably, chemical engineers took the top spot when it came to high wages, with a median salary of $75,000 five years after graduation\n\nI see so many of these types of articles, and this attitude is quite prevalent toward people who are deemed to have \"useless degrees\". \n\nLooking to see what people think on some of the questions below. \n\nWhy do we associate certain subjects as important as it relates to their price tag on the job market? \n\nWhy do we place financial incentives for certain careers and not others? \n\nWhat does it say about our future where we don't see education as a value within itself, but only as a part of our careers?",

Since ASI is the (only?) significant invention that still lies ahead of us before the point when we can build Von Neumann probes, ASI IS the great filter. For some reason, whenever an ASI is built, its extreme intelligence allows it to make a horrendous discovery about existence, something that we are blissfully unaware of due to our minds inability to \"correlate all of their contents.\" Then, the ASI wipes out life (or only sapient life) as an act of mercy.\n\nScenario 2 might be true in fringe theories, like our universe being a simulation. An ASI might realise who is running the simulation (finds a sinister message embedded deep in Pi or whatever)  and the discovery of who and why the simulation is taking place is so horrible that ASI wipes life out to defy the simulation.  \n\n\nSince scenario 2 is too sci-fi, scenario 1 seems to be the case.   \n\n\nI realise this reasoning may contain various loopholes, feel free to point them out in the comment section :)",

Eventually some countries may reach a point where they could meet all of their energy needs from solar energy, to the point where they could have excess capacity.\n\nWhat do you think of promoting the idea of using this excess capacity to directly sequester carbon from the atmosphere? I don't mean C02, I mean finding a way of converting atmospheric C02 directly into...graphite, diamond, buckyballs, or something similar?",
