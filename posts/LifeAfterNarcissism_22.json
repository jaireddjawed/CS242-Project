We are now divorced and he quickly remarried shortly thereafter. What clicked for you that helped you heal? I do not miss him because of the abuse. I do miss his charming times and the times that he gave love and companionship, but I do not miss the withdrawal and psychological manipulation that conditioned me to seek the consistency of his love as a reward for behaving and being obedient to him. I find myself romanticizing and remembering the good stuff and I have to shift to remind myself of the other half and how mentally abusive the whole situation was to myself and my children. I want to stop looking back. I want to look forward. I do not date, have no desire to. I do not trust myself to make a good choice the next time around. I am of the mind that I will wait until my children are grown. ",

Or when I'm alone in a living room, and someone comes through - like they're going into 'my room' - I tell myself to act natural, but I can't relax. Basically, I can't relax around people, and always think they're going to blow up at me. It's been years since this happened - I've been out of my N home for ages. When will it end? Will I be afraid for the rest of my life and have to live in seclusion or with limited contact? Or can I integrate into society? Please help. \n\nA constant thought is 'how do I get further away?' I make plans to get as far away from people/civilization as a possible. I don't know how I can live with my fear. \n\nAdded to this is that I've moved to a new city/country, and it's a little unfamiliar to me - is this part of natural feelings? Sometimes I mistake natural feelings for PTSD because I was told everything was 'wrong' with me, and it creates confusion. I suppose it would be normal to be a little afraid with unfamiliar people/in an unfamiliar place, but the way people react to me, seems to show something different. I just don't know.

        "text": "Sorry for the long post but here goes. My mother and father were both sexually abused growing up. Neither got help but my father certainly did much better in life than my mother. My dad got his 4 year and bought the family a pretty decent house. My mom began going through all the kids as they were born, looking for her mini me. I became the scapegoat child, but this isn’t about me. My mother was a malignant narcissist with munchousens by proxy and I have been no contact since the following happened:\n   I was in college and the golden child (sister, now 18 but wasn’t during the time period of events) was on a decent soccer team. She began working with this coach and things got weird. My mom began turning the golden child sister against my father incrementally. My mom began slamming her phone down anytime someone cane into the room. She was acting defensive and hostile and basically guilty. More than usual I suppose. Narcissists tell on themselves. Then my dad discovered these emails where my the golden child was calling this coach her daddy and how she loved her daddy very very very much. My mother wouldn’t let my father have much to do with the golden child. One of these emails was sent from my mothers phone to the coach saying: I.L.M.D.V.VV.M. (I love my daddy very very very much?). My mother claimed my sister sent it from my moms phone due to lack of service at a soccer tournament. They kept sending emails back and forth, urging each other to delete them upon receiving them. There was one email where my sister wasn’t wearing any bottoms and blocked her private parts with a stuffed animal that had been sent to the soccer coach. My mom constantly bombarded us with obnoxious sex jokes that were the same ones over and over. Then this man was also texting my sister and my mother 3,000 texts a month. Then it became mostly my sister texting the coach. Then it increased to 5,000 texts a month. Then it maxed out at 6,000 texts a month. My sister began receiving gifts from this man. She got a brand new desktop computer, and iPad, 1000$ in skiing equipment, a 500$ season skiing pass and going on outings every weekend to kings island and dinner etc... my mother became more nasty and started blaming me for some of the debt she created from going out so much (I don’t care, this just gives perspective). The soccer coach allegedly paid for everything. Bank statements back that up as true. But this man lives with his mom and dad at 50 years old and gets 20g every Xmas from his aunt. Then we found photos of this coach holding my sister on his lap and it made the hairs on the back of my neck stand straight up. It was much too intimate looking but I may be biased. There were also other photos of them all together in secret, excluding my father every chance they got. They would laugh and giggle saying how he was spying on them and stuff. Believe me, no one would sleep with my mom. She’s pretty gross looking and smelling but it would not surprise me if the coach wanted to in order to get to my sister. My dad was so freaked out that he talked to a counselor and the counselor said that if my dad did not go to the head of the soccer association and the police, by law he had to. My dad confronted the coach and the claim was that everyone on the team called him daddy and told him they loved him. There is zero evidence of this on his Facebook page because I looked and so did several other people. His Facebook page is open to the public. I realize that’s just Facebook but if it were out in the open and everyone was doing it... \nanyway the soccer coach ended up being pulled from position of coach and forbidden from coaching any team anywhere for the rest of his life. He has been black listed. Is this because of the volume of texts and emails or because of what they contained? I realize this may be obvious to the reader, but the scapegoat typically knows the least. I know many of the more serious ones had to have been deleted. Then my mom had my sister write a letter to my father (my mom wrote it though) saying how he ruined her life and how she lost friends and playing time and how he wasn’t welcome at her games. (My mother is a deadbeat). He came anyway and then mom left him a note on the table telling him that the golden child hates him and he will never have a relationship with her.  Mom and the golden child  slept in the same room and took showers together before this happened. Then she managed to turn the rest of the family against him. Not me though because I always saw through her. She was frantic to get me on her side and begged me to let her tell my dad that I hated him too (I’m the oldest). I’m also thinking she was trying to manipulate him into killing himself so she would get the life insurance money. The abuse my dad endured over the following 3 years is unbelievable. It’s a miracle he didn’t off himself. He finally moved out after I did and is much better. \nWhat does this look like to you guys? It’s harder to analyze when it’s your own family. Was my sister being groomed for molestation? Was she being molested? This has been very difficult but I am hoping to get some insight or a better understanding. Again, I apologize for the long post. Thank you so much for taking the time to read this. Any and all opinions are welcome!  ",

His girlfriend had many chances to stay with her parents but kept going back to him. They have a 1 year old and 5 year old. I heard them fighting, as they usually do, but this time, he had her cornered and I called 911. They came out, I told them what he told me (there was a demon inside her, and he had tried many times to beat it out of her), he was delusional, hadn't slept, kept us all up for days sick with worry. He left, and she went with him. He came back 30 minutes later pounding at the door that he had to take care of her, and left her in the ditch (at 10 degree F weather). He said she was sexually assaulting the children. I called 911 again, and by this time, he was throwing us all in the walkin closet because we also had the demon and he was going to have to get rid of it. Luckily i also managed to escape and call 911 from my neighbors. My young son, age 8 made it out of the house with me. I was so scared leaving the 2 girls, I made the call and came back. He had the 1 year old in the snow, who knows what he had done to the 5 year old. He was already facing serious charges of taking a shotgun on the boat and threatening random strangers.  The mother was treated and released at the hospital. After talking with my 5 year old granddaughter, I became so angry at what both of those monsters put those children through.  We go to the counselors tomorrow so hopefully she is brave enough to talk about it. She is confused. She misses them and has been lead to believe that this was her fault. I am relieved the abuser is going to be locked away for a while. Hopefully the mother will be healthy before she is allowed alone time with the children.",

        "text": "Growing up, my moms narcissism trained me to be a doormat. My nmom would want to do something, and I would go along with it and either came to like it or convince myself it was ok. However it was always my moms way or nothing, which led to the explosion when my mom wanted to do something which my wife did not. This highlighted how many times I have just gone along with what my mom wants to do, from throughout my childhood up to the present day.\n   \nHowever what I am starting to struggle with is the fact my wife does  similar things. It may even be why we were able to connect and become married. It never bothered me at all originally, it was how I showed my love for her that I would do chores around the house and sit with her and do whatever she wanted to do. However since standing up to my mom on this issue, everything feels different and I feel like I am not being considered about instead.\n\nYesterday she asked me to change the laundry, I also emptied and reloaded the dishwasher and tidied up a lot of the house. Instead of feeling the feeling I used to feel, I instead feel hollow and used. I don't feel satisfied doing these things. When I want to go off to work on a project in my hobby room, she starts to complain of feeling lonely after 15mins, so I sit with her and watch TV for 2 hours, with the hollow feeling increasing the whole time. She can tell something is wrong, but I know if I say it's because I want to persue my interests, she will guilt-trip me with \"fine, go and do it then, whatever\" type responses.\n   \nAnyway, that evening, it turned out I had accidentally transferred a non-drier piece of clothing into the drier, and I apologized. Then she started up again in the evening, saying that she wished I gave more care and attention to the laundry. I told her if she wanted it done better she should do it herself and a fight ensued. After things had calmed down the hollow feeling was still there.\n   \nOverall I'm feeling down about it. It feels like all my life is is work 8 hours a day, come home, eat, sit with wife with her TV shows because thats all she wants to do. If I do ask to go and work on a project she occasionally allows it, but it feels like there is a timer ticking in the background. Before confronting my mom, I accepted this, but now I feel like I should not allow my desires, hopes and dreams to continue to be crushed. I feel like my only option is to wait till she goes to sleep then just go downstairs to work on my projects from 11pm-1/2am and suffer sleep deprivation. Maybe I am just feeling stronger this way as a sort of reaction against all the years dealing with it from my mom?\n   \nAny time I bring up this issue my wife insists that it isn't true and that I do have time for my hobbies, and any time I am working there she exaggerates how long it's been, 30 mins in reality turns into 90 mins in her head. This reminds me of the kind of gaslighting/manipulation my mom does. She admits to having abandonment issues but I don't know what to do.\n   \nBefore I used to not mind this lifestyle, but now since putting the foot down with my nmom I'm seeing it through a different lens. If I was against my moms manipulation to the point of cutting her out of my life, how can I stand for my wife's manipulation. I feel like I can't be an individual person, I can't pursue my hobbies even though I have invested money into the room and the equipment, you can't \"buy\" time to actually pursue the interest. I also always thought of myself as making some kind of mark on the world, not just going to an office every day.",

        "text": "I've been friends with him since middle school. We drifted apart for about 5-10 years and reconnected about a year ago. I was happy because I had known him for so long and was happy to rekindle the friendship. For context, he is a gay man and I am a female.\n\nWhen we reconnected he began right away bragging about his life which I later found out was mostly lies. He told me he had a big house in the country. I later learned that it's his bosses house. He has lied about most aspects of his life like this and I've not called him out on it because it's just a plain bizarre thing he's doing. He's invited me out to \"his country house\" several times and I've not gone because it's his bosses house and I also have my own house. \n\nI was willing to deal with some of the weird lies as self-esteem issues, he's insecure, whatever. But, the main problem is that he never asks me how I am doing. Every time he contacts me it's about himself. If he texts me, it's to show me his new haircut or a photograph of a theater ticket or some other sort of humble brag. \n\nMonths ago I launched a new business and decided to see how long it would take for him to ask me about it. He would text me photos of his new shoes or something and I'd tell him how busy I was with my launch. He never asked me what I was launching. He still has no idea. I could have been launching into outer space for all he cares. \n\nHas anyone had to deal with a one-sided friendship like this where the other person was so self-obsessed and took no interest in your life? I don't know what to do anymore. I've known him for decades and he will occasionally say things like \"I miss you. When are you coming to town?\" ...but in general, he never really asks how I am doing whereas I've really tried to be a good friend. \n\nHe has always been somewhat jealous of me and I feel like some of what he does (lying about his successes) may have a bit to do with that. Sometimes he gets drunk and calls me on the phone and cries and tells me I'm his smartest friend, he loves me, etc. But he knows NOTHING about my life. His texts never even start with \"How are you?\" They are always basically, \"Look at me.\" \n\nI'm not comfortable bringing this up with him because it's all too weird and at this point it's really just who he is. He's not going to change. Might it be best to just try to slowly go no contact? It really stresses me out because I try to have a meaningful relationship yet all he ever cares about is himself.\n\nMy father is a narcissist, but my friend is different in that he has never been cruel, gaslighting, or abusive. He just shows no interest in what I'm doing. Even though he contacts me all the time, it's only to show me or tell me something about himself or to ask me advice. I ran a test to see how long it would take him to care about or ask about my business launch and the answer is forever because he still doesn't know what I launched.",

        "text": "My Nmother passed away six years ago fairly young with breast cancer. This reshaped my family completely with my Nfather moving to live near the adult golden child (my younger brother) who himself is manipulative and emotionally abusive such as taking over my Ndad’s life and then trying to guilt trip that he is the only one who looks after Ndad even though he insisted my father move. \n\nMy Ndad has a long history of doing things like forgetting to let me know about family events like funerals and then recruiting golden child brother to defend this behaviour by going on the attack saying that I see it all wrong and see problems where there isn’t any. Recently I asked my father to join myself and my husband at a special hotel an hour from where Ndad lives to see if there could be any form of healthy adult relationship. Ndad said he was too unwell with mystery illness. Fast forward a couple of months and Ndad texts me to tell me he is moving in with a girlfriend who he inferred he wasn’t seeing anymore when asked about six months prior.  I was shocked and didn’t answer. Approximately two weeks after this Ndad texts me to let me know he and golden child brother were going to the UK for three weeks. Golden child brother has a family and erratic work so I know Ndad was paying for the trip. \n\nObviously I am finally getting to the point of realising No Contact is required in this toxic family environment. Ndad sent two texts after returning from the trip and I ignored one ok. Being the middle child “good girl” my guilty conscience plays up thinking of how depressed my father has been after Nmothers death, what kind of daughter am I, etc etc. Of course Ndad has had no curiousity or support for me in my mothers passing yet my rational brain keeps being guilt tripped. I dread Christmas and family birthdays. I know nobody can solve this and just writing this helps. I don’t know how to stop trying to be the good daughter even when I know there’s nothing but pain and manipulation there for me. Thanks for reading. \n\n",

        "text": "It's actually a really big thing for me. I know that no one is probably interested, but growing up my Mom shamed me constantly for not having a purse. I didn't know why I had such an extreme aversion to purse wearing. I'd carry a duffle bag, a tote bag - anything to avoid carrying things in a purse...I associated it with femininity, and with my Mom, and even considered the fact that I might be transgender because I had this extreme type of aversion to all things feminine. I could imagine now my Mom saying to me - \"you should carry a purse!\" and if I didn't, it was wrong - I was performing as a girl wrong, and she harped on this a lot. It made me very uncomfortable, and I have a lot of shame around bags, I'm just realizing. I had a friend - and we went out last night, and he kind of teased me about carrying a big bag around - and I get teased about this a lot (it's a security thing - I like to carry a lot of stuff with me. I don't know if it's related to trauma (fight and flight) and needing to go...that general feeling of insecurity - but yeah, I do this a lot).\n\nI've had such trouble in this area, and I wanted to break out of it - be a 'woman' without feeling ashamed - and I associate purse wearing/buying with my Mom, so it's hard, but I bought one at a thrift store the other day. It was nice - understated, and I've gotten comfortable - realizing how comfortable it is to put it on my shoulder and have something lighter than a huge bag. It's still stressful - I feel like everyone's judging me for my bag choices (residual stuff from N Mom? Shaming me in this area), but it's getting better...I wanted to share and work through some of this stuff here. It's such a small thing, but it's come up, (everything's coming up all at once, it feels like sometimes), and I needed to work through it...it's amazing how insidious Narcs are...how they infect everything - even the smallest bits of life. \n\n**TL;DR - I was yelled at/shamed for not wearing a purse growing up because it's the mark of being 'female' (which I'm bad at) and now I can't carry or buy a bag.** \n\n**Thanks, Narc. Mom. I'm working through this, and bought something at a thrift store that I'm comfortable with. Still working through wearing it without feeling ashamed.** \n\nAlso, I thought I was transgender because of this matter. Nope - just Narcs. :/ They really put us through Hell, don't they?\n\nThanks for reading. ",

        "text": "Now that I own my own home, it's easier dealing with my parents. When they come here, they're on my turf, and very respectful. So I don't mind them visiting. \n\nI invited them (and my siblings) to Thanksgiving dinner at my place this year. My siblings all live far away—and my husband's family lives close, and there's about 25 of them. The last several years we've gone to his parents' place, which has a room large enough to host everyone. But I miss Thanksgiving done the way my family did—while it was always fraught with drama, in general I have good memories of the holiday. \n\nI'm not opposed to inviting my husband's family to my house for Thanksgiving, but I talked to his mother and she understands that cooking for 25+ people for the first time is going to be daunting (not to mention we really don't have the room). So we talked about it and decided it made sense to do two Thanksgivings. No one was offended. \n\nMy parents were invited and turned out to be the only ones who could come. And I let them know they were also invited to my in-law's for Thanksgiving. \n\nHere comes the drama! Of course, my parents can't stand the idea of me having another family (especially one that is supportive). They behaved terribly at my wedding. My father thinks my husband's family is a cult that has brainwashed me. Like, how dare I enjoy the company of anyone else on the planet. And that I'm so weak-minded that I could even be brain-washed.  \n\nOver time my mom initially grew to really like my MIL. So she was enthusiastic about going to both Thanksgivings. My father, however, doesn't like my husband's family at all. And yeah, they're not always the easiest people to be around, I'll give him that. But he threw a fit at the idea of spending time with them. Usually it's my mom behaving N, but this time, it's my dad. \n\nI told them I was happy to host them, but that I was obligated to go to my husband's family's Thanksgiving, and they were welcome to join us there, but no pressure. Even so, my mom thought it would be rude not to (or really wanted to go, and wouldn't say it) and they had a fight about it. She tried to drag me into it, but I refused. I told her to get back to me when she decided. \n\nWeeks go by. Finally she calls, and she has her sad voice on. [eyeroll] Basically she says, oh, it turns out they're having furniture delivered right around Thanksgiving and can't come. Which I can tell is a lie, but in this case, better than saying \"your father is acting like a baby and he doesn't like your husband's family so we're not going.\" So I'm OK with it.  \n\nBut THEN she says, but the furniture delivery got rescheduled, but they already told their friends they'd have Thanksgiving with *them*. So they can't come to ours, but what about the week before or after? And I say, OK, we'll think about it and talk later. \n\nAnd the thing is—I genuinely don't care. If they can't or don't want to come to my Thanksgiving, that is fine. \n\nBut ... here's the thing... they can cancel on their own daughter's Thanksgiving—and not bother to tell her—but they won't cancel on their friends? So their friends are more important than me? \n\nI'm not surprised, so I don't care. They're doing what they want to do. But now the furniture delivery thing just sounds like a pointless lie that has nothing to do with social grace at all. They're saying \"we said we'd go to your Thanksgiving, but we can't, because we said we'd go to someone else's, and we care more about what they think than what you think.\" \n\nPart of me says, I should stand up for myself, and point this out.  I've stood up plenty when they've tried to control me. I haven't stood up in this situation yet. It's been a long time since this kind of thing has come up. Since this is a rare occasion when my father is being the difficult one, I feel like I have an opportunity to say something and be heard. \n\nSo do I say something? Even though I actually don't care? What would I say? \n\nTLDR; for the first time since I figured out they were emotionally stunted, my parents have prioritized their wants/needs over my own. Even though I'm not surprised and don't care about their decision, should I say something, and what? \n\n[Update here if anyone is interested](https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/7b22mh/i_put_my_feelings_first/)",

But now, I just perceive his anger, I have a perception of \"It's your anger, I perceive it, and I leave it with you, it's not my feeling\", it neither makes me angry nor makes me shut off to him emotionally, it's just that I can leave those feelings with him - so, a specific boundary works.\n\nProgress, guys.

I kept pushing it, very gently of course, because otherwise who knows what the reaction might be. After another session of him yelling at me and calling me all sorts of things, I overheard him telling our (1 year old) son how I am an evil bitch. That somehow was one step too far for me and I got really mad at him. I may talk to others about him, but I'd never talk like that to our son and he has absolutely no right to do that. So then he told me how I was going to have to leave but that he'd keep our little one (who he's never put to bed, or comforted when he was sick, or comforted in any way ever) with him and he wouldn't allow me to take him or to come back into the house. So when he was at work, I packed some bags and left the house.\nHe seems okay with it now. The other day I did let him spend the day with our son but after 3 hours I already received a message if I could pick him up early, so I think he is also realizing how full time parenting might not be his thing (too boring, exhausting, who knows). My son and I are safe and will be safe. I've got a good lawyer now who is helping me handle this as safely, calmly and legally beneficial as possible. My family is supporting me so amazingly well. \nNow I am just left with having to heal. Now that I am out of the adrenalin fight and/or flight mode, I feel so empty, lost and lonely. I know I am not alone, but the rediscovering of myself and constructing my own life again is going to take some time, love (from myself for myself) and effort. ",

Carey moved to the middle of nowhere when he was 18 and worked in the mines and various odd jobs. He'd come home at Christmas, attend family events and stuff, and then take off again. That was just his way. I never thought much about it. Carey's parents (my aunt and uncle) are ok, not Ns and not abusive. Just kind of distant and not affectionate. \n\nI went NC with my Nparents after 35 years of pain just over a year ago. I confided in one of my cousins about it recently though I didn't give a reason.  \n\nShe said \"Oh, so you're like Carey.\" I said \"what do you mean?\" She said \"Well he's always just been his own guy, doesn't feel close to his mom and dad, he'll email me sometimes and I love him but he just wants to be by himself and do his own thing. He just never cared much about the family.\"\n\nWhen I went NC I felt like such a freak, doing some logically correct but morally awful thing I'd just find a way to forgive myself for. But Carey hasn't given a shit since he was 15. Carey knows his mom and dad are ok but doesn't feel obligated to be in their lives. No drama, no anger, just a choice he made. I guess I am like Carey. It was a relief to feel that I'm not alone in my own family, and that my decision was always the right one for me. ",

You said 'Whenever you started up I would just hand you off to someone else'. There is no room in love for abuse, neglect, or abandonment. Love comes at the worst times, when you are crying, when you are broken, when you are dirty, when you are at your lowest. Love does not abandon you there because something awful has happened to you. **You abandoned me as a mother after I was raped because you couldn't fucking handle it**. You told me to move out. I did. I am independent, I am a badass, and I am taking this fucking world by storm and **I did it all without you**.\"\n\nAnd she was crying in the corner, her head bowed, 'Oh poor me I'm so horrible but I tried, *I tried*!'\n\"NO, you *did not try*. You literally *paid someone else to raise me*, who--along with her daughter--abused me for *my entire fucking childhood*. **There was abuse going on under your roof, you knew about it, and you did nothing.** You always said, when I said please find someone else, '*Oh, I can't do that, I need her*'. You didn't think anything was wrong when you saw I was slashing my legs and my arm, you didn't think anything was wrong **when I tried to fucking kill myself**. You yelled at me, you *locked me up*, and then you abandoned me again.**You are not my mother**.\"\n\nAlso the part where *she literally never held me when I cried*, I threw that at her too because that will fuck up your kid so hard if you literally never comfort them when they scream for hours on end. \n\nAt one point she had looked at EDad and tearfully said \"Don't you remember me holding her? Don't you remember the things I did?\"\nHE SAID THIS: \"I remember you and I talking about [the nanny] and what we should do.\"\n\nSo they knew.

The few times I repeated his lectures directly in class, I got shot down, he would not hesitate to make up quotations and misuse long words for effect. He couldn't explain things without making you feel like a complete idiot, so we never really asked him for his opinion, but he just kept providing it to the point where my little brother and I pretty much relied on it as a part of the landscape. There was already a huge void of emotional connection waiting to be filled in my home before he left, and it's still there but at least his weird speeches are no longer dulling our awareness of it. But when he left it's that sense of certainty we lost, the sense that we don't have to worry about truth because Dad can explain it and make us look stupid for not knowing. It took maybe a year of his absence for us to realise what utter garbage his lectures were, how liable he was to self-contradiction in every way, and frankly how intrusive and insulting he knowingly made himself. He recently told my brother what I'd pretty much inferred- he feels his life is all about fucking the world over, as in sexually fucking; so I suspect in his mind verbal diarrhoea is metaphorical rape, his exultation in paradox is literally supposed to be a mindfuck. I spent my adolescence convincing myself that he made sense, and it was pretty time consuming, frantically compressing all these sediments of arrogance into a single weird bedrock. The process of liberating myself from this cognitive rape has involved several clumsy steps, starting with painstakingly trying to sift good dad doctrine from bad dad doctrine, lecturing myself and my brother about the pointlessness of lecturing, deciding that actually there's no such thing as truth, and moving forwards trying to conjugate the many certainties of science, philosophy and faith into one infallible identity to match what he provided. I'm at a point where I can't take that search seriously any more, I've lost my religion and I don't need unifying certainties in the way I did, but I still love the feeling. Truth makes me feel more solid as a person, you can use it and admire it and yeah, show it off.\nI'm sure many readers here have had monologuing narcissistic parents and have suffered similar disillusion, not just in them but in the gargantuan amount of truth they stood for. I didn't find any panacea but let me tell you, right now, Neil DG Tyson is the shit, I'm listening to his audiobook 'Astrophysics for People in a Hurry' and it's so helpful. It's not status signalling or virtue signalling like history or religion, it doesn't try to be complicated, it's some guy trying to explain complicated things as simply as possible without condescension, with so much passion, he's made an effort to be accurate and to make sure you can correct him. And it's not just completely true and verifiable, it's basic and fundamental, you feel more embodied when you get why he's excited, you feel more in tune with real physical reality. Attachment theorists in psychology will tell you that parents are supposed to introduce you to reality, you feel object permanence or social structure or embodiment through them; Neil DG is turning out to be an amazing refathering figure for me, what with his 'ice-fishing on Europa' dad-humour- and because I feel I can trust him and his subject matter, I'm putting in the extra effort to understand him when he's too in-the-zone to bother simplifying. Even if your narc parents were physics geeks, I guarantee you he'll breathe life back into the whole thing, you won't see a sadistic glimmer in his eyes when he can one-up you on general relativity.",

        "text": "Mostly a rant. Of experiencing a lot of pain. Some enlightenment in the end of it.\n\nYesterday I worked my ass off at work... utilizing every second of my time to get things done. And the people I worked with did nothing but complain all day about their coworkers. I got headaches from hearing the gossip. Then when they're talking to me they aren't even making eye contact with me. This girl would just be walking the other direction and talking (to me)... and rarely make eye contact. Which makes me so self-conscious. She may be a \"narc-in-the-wild\" I get the feel of. Partly because she came in the break room and said \"you can't be sitting in here when the next shift comes in.\" She said that in an accusatory tone even though she had just sat in there for like 2 or 3 hours straight. \n\nWe work the night shift and have pagers on us for when patients need help. So when no one is paging us, we are pretty much free to take breaks as long as we're keeping up with our work. Well she comes and says this to me about being in the break room... I'm just like friendily and obediently responding \"oh alright.\" And I did such a good job that day... like I got every single thing off the checklist done. And the way people do things there, shit doesn't usually get done. I was proud of myself. So then when I'm turning in my beeper to the lead nurse, the nurse says \"where have you been tonight? I haven't seen you. Were you camping out somewhere?\" And that hurt so much to hear. I can't help but think the other girl told the nurse something like \"Devin hasn't done anything today. He's over in the break room just not caring as usual.\" Because why else would the nurse assume I was \"camping out somewhere?\" All I could respond with was \".... No.\" With slight anger in my voice. I mean how could she say this? She barely knows me and she can visibly see on her computer screen that I have charted ALL my work. Did someone else tell her that they did my charting for me? Ugh just horrible. \n\nI came home and just was cussing up a storm. Throwing pillows and crying. I don't usually express myself like this but I was so hurt and pissed. In my confusion and rage, I accidentally soaked my contact lenses in a Nasal Spray instead of my contact lens solution. At the time I had no idea I did that. So I wake up for work today and put those lenses in... my eyes were burning like hell within seconds. This is only my second day with contacts so I thought... maybe this just happens in the first days.. Maybe the pain will fade. But no it got worse. I was on my shift at work and I could barely open my eyes to see. I had to let them rest for like 10 minutes so I could open them again, several times during the shift. I got jack shit done but luckily I was put on a part of the hospital where I'm required to do next to nothing. I still fell short of completing my work and I didn't feel \"lucky\" because I was in horrible pain and every time I walked past coworkers they would just be staring at me as if I'm a freak show... because my eyes were all red and swollen shut and it looked like I was crying. I got a couple \"are you okay?\" comments. Then when I'd explain they didn't seem to listen or care. It's like they just wanted to get the upper hand of \"I'm okay and youre not\" communicated to me. \n\nSo I spent an agonizing 10 hours wearing these contacts that had nasal spray saline soaked in them. Then when I get home it takes me forever to be able to get these contacts out... they were like suction cupped to my eyeballs. What's scary is I had got the last one out without realizing it... and for at least an hour I had been grabbing at what must have been a part of my eye. I kept \"almost getting it\".... pinching it but having it slip out. It's a good thing I didn't \"get it\" because that was probably my cornea I was trying to take out. And I was in full on panic mode the whole time. And bad bad bad pain. Still am in pain hoping they get better.\n\nThe whole time I was in pain during the day I felt really sad. I started feeling like the worried looks everyone was giving me was because of me... because of who I am... or something. I felt so judged and started doubting all aspects of my life. Thoughts like \"maybe I can't survive without my parents. What happens if I get fired from this job today? How will I pay for my apartment? What if it's not just my parents that are abusive to me and don't care for me ... what if it's everyone on earth?\" Such low feelings of self worth crept in as my eyes leaked tears out of dryness and pain from the saline. I even thought of the previous day how the nurse was rude despite me working hard. I used that as evidence that everyone hates me. I felt like I was her Nsupply because I worked the hardest I ever have and was still criticized and picked apart because of it. \n\nEven when I'm in pain from an innocent wound I start blaming myself for everything... seems like this is because I was raised by Narcissists. And I didn't care and love myself like I could have... I could have said to the Nurse \"I have to go home. I am in serious pain right now. I don't want permanent damage to my eyes.\" Instead I blamed myself for feeling so much pain... instead I pushed and pushed for me to finish the shift even though I was hurting really bad. This pushing is how the Narcs raise their kids. They push and push their kids til the kids fall and the Narcs get to absorb Nsupply. Their goal is to push their kids off a cliff where the kid will never be able to recover and will be codependent for life. ",

        "text": "My mother is a generally great human being, but she wasn't the best parent. Her method of raising me was to tell me something, get mad about the possibility of me doing it, watch me do it, and then apologize for getting mad about it in the first place. As such, until the age of 13 (when my edad and nstepmother took me in), I didn't have many basic life skills (i.e. hygene), discipline, or good grades. She also has anxiety issues, which led to paranoia about my mental and physical health that caused therapists to talk to me and nontherapists to pity me. This in turn gave paranoia about pity that clouded my social interactions, bringing more pity. We have a wonderful relationship now that I'm 18, but I'd be lying if I said that she didn't make a couple mistakes raising me. \n\n\nWhen my nparents gained full custody over me (my mother it before), they were very quick to tell me what I was doing wrong, and it was actually really beneficial for a short while. Until then I dressed like I saw on TV, and was never told not to, so when my nstepmom told me to \"stop dressing like a whore\" and \"stop acting stupid\" at 13, I took it in earnest, and was grateful for knowing their lack of pity. They pushed me into harder classes that I wouldn't otherwise have taken (and some of which I really loved), and would often take credit for my academic accomplishments. They told me what I was going to be (and told me I was being indecisive or causing drama whenever I expressed wanting to do anything else), which gave me a purpose. They also never took me to any psychologists, because they didn't believe in psychology. I enjoyed this newfound authority, because I'd never had any in my life. And I genuinely did improve in some ways; mostly socially (though I started at a pretty low bar here), hygienically, and academically.\n\n\nAs I improved more and more, I came to be more skeptical of their tactics in raising me. They refused to get me dental care, teach me how to drive, let me cook (including boil water for tea), pick my own clothes when shopping, do laundry (apparently I closed the door too hard and they didn't want me to break it), or let me stay at home alone. They would call me things like \"little bitch\", \"bastard\", \"whore\" (I've never been kissed at 18, and still wear long pants in summer), \"antisemite\" (we're Jewish), \"idiot\", \"ugly\", \"anorexic\" (I was at one point, but it's still not something you call someone in an argument) , \"sociopath\", and \"narcissist\". When I did accomplish something, such as buying and paying for the smartphone they thought I was too distractable to have (though which I needed for work), they praised me in public, and tied it back to their parenting methods. They also frequently accused me of doing things I didn't do; when I walked home with a guy from school one day, I apparently had a \"secret boyfriend\" who they were absolutely certain I was having sex with behind their backs; when I ripped my pants accidentally, I had actually done it on purpose because I hated the pants in question (ironically, I did hate them but only because they were made of such a weak fabric and because I always had to pull them up). When I brought up wanting my teeth fixed, or that clothes were too small or large, or defended friends or coworkers of mine in an argument, I was purposefully creating drama to ruin their night. When I mentioned I was having suicidal thoughts, I was making it up for attention. They also surprise-graduated me from high-school a year early while I was in running start (I should be a senior in highschool), effectively robbing me of a year of free college in favor of the congratulations of distant and hitherto unknown relatives. Gee, thanks. \n\n\nA couple months ago, on my 18th birthday, they kicked me out of the house, and sent me to live with my mom (though they suggested she charge me rent, or have me split an apartment with a friend, which she didn't do). They sent a passive aggressive email as explanation, which admitted that while other people considered me a good enough person, behind closed doors I was a lying, disrespectful, defiant jerk who either made everything into an excuse, or a power struggle. The catalyst for the email was them refusing to let my aunt (who offered without my having to mention) pay for the orthodontia I had been begging for for years, as to let her would make them look bad. \n\n\nI am now living with my mother, who is nice enough to give me all the things I lacked under my nparents; namely regular medical appointments and orthodontia, driving lessons, contacts, a key to the house, the ability to cook at home, and most importantly a sense of human decency. However, I feel myself slipping into the patterns that existed when I lived with her before; I'm not as ambitious or driven (my main drive before was making my parents happy, which doesn't exist now), and I tend to miss more deadlines and appointments. Most recently, I forgot to call my awesome aunt who pointed out their unhealthy behavior in the first place, when I confided in her about their tendencies. I'm also doing worse in college, as I'm not sure if I even want to be taking the classes I'm taking, as my nparents signed me up for them in the first place. I'm also losing friends, because my main drive to socialize used to be making my parents happy in order to appear \"normal\", and because the ones I had before don't know that I've been kicked out, and it would be embarrassing to explain. Any advice?\n\n\n**tl;dr; nparents helped me be more driven and successful socially and aceademically; now that I no longer live with them, I'm falling behind in all those areas. Advice?**",

        "text": "I'm going to a Halloween party on Saturday (or I'm supposed to). \n\nThe thing is, Halloween has always been very difficult for me. It's a few days after I permanently moved away from the United States as a young teenager, so the mixture of excitement, sadness, thwarted dreams, and difficulty expressing myself has made my favorite holiday into one of dread, confusion, and basically anger/dread, as I contest with the holidays I missed out on, the anger/sadness of my birthday being three days later (my birthdays' sucked), and the utter carelessness to which my parent's treated my spirit - celebrating it hugely one year, only to forget about it later, plus my N brother would be inappropriate, make fun of my costume/interests, say things that were inappropriate to a young girl my age (I'm still coming to terms with some of his 'comments'), and then there's the usual problems expressing myself in a Narc household. \n\nHaving interests at all was frowned upon, and my Halloweens have basically been the equivalent of trying to fly and being shot down. \n\nI've never truly dressed up, and enjoyed myself. I'm back in the states, after a shitty Halloween last year, from being overseas and spending it with my N brother again. \n\nI'm supposed to go to a party on Saturday, with the friend I posted about before (see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAfterNarcissism/comments/78ekli/my_friend_is_convinced_that_my_parents_love_me/) - basically, he's supportive, but doesn't understand family stuff), and I don't know what to do. \n\nIt's two days away, and I still don't have a costume - probably because the anxiety/dread feelings (freeze response?). This is also complicated by my fear of people in costumes (I'm starting to think it's a trauma thing - I literally cannot go near anyone dressed up in a mascot-type costume, or like as a character or something), fear of loud noises, crowds, etc. - the usual. How do I deal with this?\n\nI was thinking about skipping the party, and going to the Day of the Dead stuff over the weekend (I'm new to San Diego, and I've always been interested in the Day of the Dead), but I don't want to upset my friend. There's some huge festival, and I can conserve my energy for that, while handing out candy on the actual day, and just dressing up for the kiddos. \n\nUgh, I don't know what to do. I don't want to feel this way. I used to love Halloween. I used to think it was so cool that I had a Halloween birthday (not that my parent's acknowledged it). Cool stuff always comes out on my birthday now (there's a book of short stories by Joe Hill that I'm looking forward to), and that's been great for reclaiming my birthday, but I'm still frozen, still mixed up with dread.\n\nAny advice? I'm supposed to be happy. Instead I'm filled with dread. What do I do?",

        "text": "I'm trying to figure out where I developed this pattern of being with men that are terrible for me.  My last partner was a narcissist, our couples therapist described him as having anti-social tendencies, no empathy, etc.  The partner before that was an alcoholic who was verbally abusive.  Partner before that was okay, a little selfish but we were young.  But before that I was with someone who was physically abusive and probably an alcoholic.  Great track record I know.  \n\nMy father has some narcissist traits, I'm not sure if he's full blown but he doesn't seem capable of empathy, he's extremely self congratulatory, doesn't seem to believe he can be wrong, and has not been emotional there for me or any of my siblings.  My mother always seemed like she cared but didn't have the skills to be all that nurturing.  She had a really difficult childhood so I always chalked it up to that.  \n\nI was diagnosed with cancer in April and since then I guess its the first time I've ever really needed them since high school.  They were nice at first but that quickly faded.  I asked my father for help with something 5months ago and he didn't help me.  My mother berated me for not being assertive enough with my doctor and fixated on surgical horror stories which I did not need to hear. \n\n3 months ago I called her at the lowest point of my life, I was doing a debilitating chemotherapy and could barely function, I had moved a month before my diagnoses to a new state and don't have much of a community and I'm still getting over my breakup with happened a few months before this.  She offered no words of support or love and basically told me I wasn't doing enough to take care of myself.  I tried to tell her that she was being hurtful and that I just wanted support but she didn't seem to understand.  After that I didn't call her.  She called me back a month and a half later and our conversation was awful.  I told her I wanted a better relationship with her and that I loved her.  She told me that she didn't want to try to improve things with me and that it was hard for her to say that she loved me so she wasn't going to.  She told me I was too sensitive and this was my fault.  It ended with her telling me to grow up and I hung up on her.  \n\nI'm really trying to take a long hard look at myself and see what I need to work on and where this stuff comes from.  Does it sound like they are narcissists or just emotionally neglectful?  Does anyone else have this pattern and not have narcissistic parents?",

I know NC is needed - it's imperative, but it always makes me doubt...am I doing the right thing? Am I seeing this clearly? I feel like I've tried my best - been trying to be a good person. If you'd ask them, they'd say I was terrible. How is that 'love'? I know I'm not supposed to hold a grudge...but I don't know what to say to people. Don't know how to explain myself, or my life. I'm lost in the world, and confused. I hope I'm doing the thing by NC...please reassure me? Is it ever a good idea to stay in contact? My parents are really toxic...I'm not convinced that the things they did to me are love. If you treated a dog the way they treated me, you'd be arrested. I have no explanation for that, or reasoning as to why I'm alive. But hearing this is alienating...\n\nI don't know what to do. ",

        "text": "Hello everyone:\n\nI am a 32 year old man. While I can count the number of dates I've been on with one hand, I have never been in a relationship. My younger brother has never had a problem with dating, but this is an area I am inexperienced in. When I was growing up, my parents were definitely controlling. I am not sure if they are full blown NC, but some of the signs are there:\n\n- Feeling like an extension of my father and not my own person\n- I rarely feel like I measure up.\n- Demanding mother who has a temper she doesn't her way\n- Father enabling mother's behaviour\n- Father faulting me when I call my mother out on her behaviour.\n- Guilt trips\n- Both seem rather secretive (E.g. Father didn't tell me when my grandmother had a heart attack a few years ago. When the dog I grew up with died, I found out from my brother on facebook but my parents tried hiding it when I called and asked. Some extended family cut ties when I was little. When I inquired about it, my father tried hiding it. Also some extended family cut ties with us when I was a child and I never knew anything about it. When I asked years later, some things about my father's story didn't add up and he said that \"it was better if I didn't know.\")\n\nI only started catching on to this stuff about 3 years ago when I started to pare down my drinking and visit a therapist. But I ended up stopping completely partly because I wanted to be more aware about what was going on around me and think clearly. I am still battling other bad habits but feel way better than I did years ago. Before this, I feel like I had blinders on. After being on my own for a few years and seeing my parents less frequently, something didn't seem right when I was talking to them or hanging around them. But I couldn't put my finger on what it was. It seems every time I am around them, I feel this undercurrent of mistrust.\n\n...back to the relationships issue. Something that I have been wondering is if children of NARC parents end up not getting into relationships? I am wondering if the root issue is I am subconsciously scared off by relationships due to fear of being stuck in a miserable situation. I know for sure that I hate feeling like I am being controlled by another person and not having a say in any matters.",

I got an email from my Mom, about my brother's birthday (which I wouldn't have been going to anyway), and because of the oceans of distance, I thought to reply. \n\nI got a long reply back, which I'll put in excerpts here :\n\n&gt;I was very surprised to hear that you are overseas.  It would be nice if you told me where you have gone.  I always said it would be great if you are happy doing that and you have a job and a good place to live.  I don't know if that is the situation, but I hope it is. I respect your wishes even though it is hard to know that your daughter never wants to see or talk to you.  Alienating your whole family may make you feel ok but everyone hurts and doesn't really make the situation any better.  As parents, we love you and miss you, there is an emptiness and it is difficult to accept the fact that we may never see you.  I never wanted this to happen to our family.  I hope you find it in yourself to at least make some contact with me. I want to know if you are ok and where you are.  Have you moved permanently? Do you have a job? Have you gone back to America? \n\n&gt;As your mother, I am suffering inside.  It is hard to deal with this. Dad and I are still planning to move to ******* next year, maybe that doesn't matter to you. I wanted to see you before we go, but I know now that you don't want to see me.  I know things haven't been easy for you, but I think now you are getting older and would have had some compassion.  I never meant to hurt you in any way and thought that I could be a help to you and have a relationship as I get older. Please think and reconsider for your own wellbeing and our family. I miss you terribly and hope you are ok.\n\n&gt;I hope you enjoy your birthday.  \n\n&gt;Take care and I love you always.\n\n&gt;Love Mom\n\nI'm...confused? I lied, and said that I had a job (I don't) - I don't want to worry her, and I was surprised at her reaction...she seemed supportive of me moving before, as her family is from here...I'm basically just going home, and she said that she expected this of me, growing up (that I would return to where I'm comfortable, or at least live around where I grew up). \n\nI'm been in PTSD mode the past two years, because I've had to manage \"contact\" with them, with triggers all around me, and continual neglect from other sources that meant a lot of the hard work I did in the first few years NC was undone...now I'm pretty much back to square one-ish in terms of negative/toxic thoughts, but far away, and at least somewhere reasonably safe, for the time being. \n\nI dunno...it's progress that I lied (even though I feel guilty). I wonder if it's worth going hard NC again, rather than getting sucked back in (from far away). I thought that she'd be a little proud that I'd moved, trying to improve my life, and my brother (GC) goes overseas all the time without telling my Mom, so I figured it would be the same?\n\nI'm going NC again, but yeah...the guilt has been unbearable the past couple years (NC on Christmas - that was hard), and I'm just dealing with it still. \n\n\n**EDIT:** I should put that in the reply to this email, I told her I'd be away over the holidays (Christmas and New Years), and that I had a job (still working on that), and a place to stay (I do, but it's temporary). I'm being supported by a friend, which is terrifying, but I have money to crash somewhere, if need be. \n\n",

As we both got more attached, we both began opening up more and more to one another. One night during our regular bedtime call, he said something that triggered something from my past while talking about his day. I got outwardly upset, and tried to explain why I did. He got defensive (which was pointless and made me feel that it was more important to him to be RIGHT instead of having a dialogue and trying to understand me) so I hung up on him feeling helpless. The next day I texted him saying sorry for hanging up and that I would like another chance to try to explain what it was I had gone through to feel that way. I did NOT get to explaining what had happened (didn't feel I could trust him with my most private stories after this exchange). We \"broke up\" (we had just been in very early stages of talking about commitment) but the worst part is that he accused me of emotional blackmail! Thinking about that is making me sick at my stomach and I even have moments where I ask myself \"am I emotionally abusive???\" That shit really hurt because I know what it's like to be constantly emotionally abused. \n\n\nI'm trying to find a way to cope with this (just happened last week) and wondering how I can filter trustworthy/non-trustworthy people better in the future. I would like to think that he said those things because HIS past experiences made him more guarded. I would also like to imagine him one day developing more empathy and compassion and realize where I was coming from. Funny thing is, he claimed to be an empath. YEAH RIGHT! (sarcasm) \n\n\nWell, I have blocked him on everything because I felt really betrayed by his coldness after we had become this close.... It's like somehow I am still looking for validation from him and I need to get over that. It is so FRUSTRATING to seek understanding, and find that the people you care about frequently do not understand. \n\n\nHow do I:\n\ndo a better job of vetting people who are at least going to LISTEN when I bring these heavy things up? (He honestly treated me great up until this convo. Although, looking back, he did have some reservations about me being bisexual....)\n\nget over the things he said that are stuck in my head?\n\nbring up past traumas within the context of a dating relationship? I discuss broad generalizations but specific stuff usually doesn't come up until I'm triggered, and then the other person feels I'm not the same person I was, or they just can't handle it. \n\nshow myself more compassion? \n\nEDIT: formatting ",

        "text": "This sounds ridiculous but I'm constantly suspicious of myself and feel like I'm about to break. I don't even know how to write this post while knowing that I'll be inevitably inserting my own bias into it. Anytime I say or write something that I realize might elicit compassion or even just understanding from someone else, I instantly doubt myself, \"Is this really how you feel, or are you just trying to get people to feel sorry for you?\" \n\nA bit of backstory because I don't know how else to explain it:\n\n(Seems like my parent is N so I'll just call them NP.)\n\nFrom all accounts, NP's mom seems pretty clearly narcissistic and was violent and cruel when they were growing up so NP strongly resents her. I was too young to remember, but apparently my grandmother mellowed out a bit and babysat me quite a lot and allegedly even tried to stop NP from punishing me once or twice when she was present. So more resentment.\n\nI do remember one time getting into trouble for something when I was maybe 6 or 7 and writing my grandmother a letter saying that I wanted to go stay with her because NP was mad at me and I didn't know what I did wrong. I don't remember the situation at all, or what I was actually thinking when I wrote it -- only that NP found it and yelled at me that \"I knew exactly what I did.\" \n\nI can't know if I was just pretending to be innocent, but based on later memories of NP blowing up at the drop of a hat with no explanation, it seems possible that I really didn't know why I was in trouble.\n\nBut either way, it only matters because it seems like a pivotal example that set the tone for my life until adulthood. It seems like I was constantly accused of being \"just like my grandmother\" (even to the point that NP secretly warned my spouse not to marry me for that reason -- as my spouse later told me.) I don't remember any specific complaints as an older kid and teenager or whether they were reasonable, but I was usually just told to \"stop acting like you're so mistreated,\" or that I was being selfish or acting like a brat. So to this day I honestly feel like I can't tell whether I'm just feeling sorry for myself/acting unreasonable when something goes wrong.\n\nOn one hand, it sounds like a pretty textbook example of similar \"raised by narcissists\" experiences I've been reading about regarding projection and gaslighting, but I can't be sure. And it almost feels like that phenomenon where animals will abandon their young if someone else has come into contact with them -- like NP associated me with their mother they resent so therefore I'm just guilty by association.\n\nBut on the other hand, I'm terrified that it's somehow true that I am like her. I've seen enough of my grandmother to know that she is in fact very self-absorbed, lazy, childish, a bully, shifts blame, and won't tolerate the slightest inconvenience. I know how the entire family talks about her behind her back and tries to avoid her, how her husband's been miserable, and how she seems pretty oblivious to all of it. I've seen enough to know that she's about the last person in the world I'd want to emulate, but pretty much any label I was given by my parents would also apply to her. Honestly it feels like I've been cursed or something. Or even if not exactly like her overt narcissism, I'm worried I might be a covert narcissist. I get stuck in my own head a lot which seems like possible self-absorption, and maybe it's possible that it's not actually social anxiety that keeps me from doing charity work but just selfishness and laziness. I'm terrified that I'm somehow just in denial about myself, because isn't that what a narcissist would be?\n\nOn top of this, I'm realizing that I basically distrust anyone in my corner, because I feel like I must have manipulated them somehow by exaggerating my side of the story -- just like that letter I wrote my grandmother when I was a kid. Even just being aware of this possibility before I press \"submit\" on this post feels like I'm making the decision to try to manipulate sympathy by sharing this. \n\nI've been wanting to seek therapy/counseling, but I'm stuck between needing someone to understand in order to give me insight about myself because I can't trust my own perception, but then if they sympathize or agree with me I feel like I can't trust them either. Did NP train me to doubt myself, or am I just playing the victim/looking for someone to blame yet again? I know no one can really give me specific answers to that, but is there anyway to stop this mess? I don't know how to live with myself like this.\n\nThanks immensely for any suggestions.\n",

        "text": "I fell in love with my Nex when we were in 6th grade. His mom had been friends with my mom since they were in middle school and had reconnected (His mom was the one who got my mom into pills, drinking and meth. She stopped doing that stuff when she got pregnant), so I got to know him more. \n \nWe didn't date until I was out of high school (My mother never approved of him) and had been kicked out by my mother. \n\nThere were signs early on in the relationship that things weren't right. He banned me from stripping, my only form of income, because he didn't like other guys looking at what was his, yet he wouldn't find a job to support us. He locked me out of the house when I continued to go to work, so I stopped. We went to a party hosted by one of my close friends, the friend and I were talking about stuff we had done in the past (typical rebellious teenager stuff. Drinking, smoking pot, stupid exes behaviour) and Nex has gotten mad. He shoved me into the wall, broke my friends mirror and left. He texted me and told me if I didn't get home he was going to leave me. I chalked it up to him being drunk and walked home in 13 degree weather. \n\nHe cheated on me constantly and said it was because I wasn't trying hard enough to make him happy. I was young and stupid, and I knew he had had a horrible child hood (His mother was always addicted to something, his dad is also a narcissist and was in an out of prison a lot. Him and his sister lived with his grandma, who drugged their food with sleeping pills and ADHD medication. She admitted that to me), so I forgave him and tried to make him happy. \n\nWe ended up moving two hours away from my family and friends, he said he had found a great job and he'd be able to support us. Around that time, I also discovered I was pregnant. Two weeks after finding out, he and I had gotten into a fight because I didn't want to smoke weed anymore, and he's a very big stoner. He wanted me to continue being one, and when I repeatedly said no, he punched me. And kicked me. And said I was worthless and couldn't keep him happy. \n\nAfter I lost the baby, I was lost. But I forgave him, I always forgave him, for some reason I thought I could change him. He ended up losing the job, and invited his stepmother to move in. She brought her 17 year old co worker along too, she was a beautiful full chested girl but she was basically a child. Nex left me on his birthday, so he could be with her. \n\nI was still living there, I was trying to set up a place to live back in my hometown. On the day I left, my Nex threw a huge fit. He broke down the bathroom door, and pinned me against the wall while I was showering. He told me if I left that day that I would prove that everything he ever thought about me was true: That I was just a petty whore who didn't deserve to live. He calmed down a bit, and let me get dressed. When I came out of the bathroom I found him in the hallway, cutting himself. Blood was dripping, that memory is seared into my head, and I panicked. I pushed him, and he dropped the knife. He fell to the floor, crying and begging me not to leave, telling me he was going to kill himself if I left. So I stayed for another two weeks.\n\nHe finally let me leave on the condition that I stayed with his father, so he would know what I was doing. That was fine by me, it was a place to stay and I absolutely adored his younger sister and brother. During the months that followed, I ended up getting two really good jobs, most of my paychecks went to my Nex. He told me he needed the money because he had been evicted and was homeless. Most of the money went towards drugs. \n\nWe fought alot after the breakup, during the peak of one of our fights he screamed at me that I should just go sleep with his dad. I was drunk, but that's still no excuse. I did it, I slept with his dad and continued to for a long time(Months). His father got upset with me one night and told my Nex what happened, my Nex told his dad that he was going to \"force me to claim rape\". \n\nThat never happened (I would never have done that anyways), and I haven't heard from Nex since a month BEFORE he found out. Which is incredibly odd, because he called me on Christmas to tell me to kill myself because he thought I had moved on. Earlier today I was driving to a Haunted House I volunteer at and I saw him in a near by car. I had to ask my friend driving if she could pull over for a moment, because I was having a panic attack. I was hyperventilating and nearly threw up, but seeing him also made me wonder. I wrote out an apology for him, and was just waiting for a sign to send it, could seeing him have been a sign?\n\nI feel bad for what I did and I also feel terribly confused because I miss him. I miss the good times and sometimes I even miss the toxicity, I don't know why I do and that makes me feel worse. \n ",

One year ago I got this card in secret in order to buy my ticket out of here from my Npartner, because all of our finances were synchronized and we could view all of each other's transactions. That sparked a sentimental moment and I felt I needed to ponder on my life thus far.\n\nAnyway.\n\nI had too much pride to go back to my parents, he convinced me to think that they hated me and I did not contact them for 5 years, after leaving to be with him when I turned 18. I am now in contact with them. The relationship with them feels dead to me but that is my fault mentally, I'm sure. They truly love and care for me, I know it. I have a hard time feeling empathy for anyone. That does not make me cold, it makes me compensate by being fake. Oh well.\n\nI moved far far away and lived in a motel and biked to a job fair, got a full time job and saved up for a deposit on an apartment close to work. I bike to work every day. I save my own money instead of having it be spent by my partner on his hobbies. I live life.\n\nfor the first time in my life, I make friends. I go to the movies and friendly events. I get rides to the grocery store. I buy in bulk. I cook in bulk. I freeze food, I eat somewhat well. I live life.\n\nI meet someone, somewhat quickly... For the first time in my life, at 24, I go on a real life \"date\" instead of meeting someone online who coerced me to believe we were fated for each other. We date, he cooks for me, he introduces me to his friends, I live life.\n\nFor the first time in my life, I am dumped. That's not a good word for it. How about retroactively friendzoned? They state they are not ready for a committed relationship. At 23, they have only just gotten their own place. However I was indoctrinated into being a loyal housewife at 18. I must ooze of desires for commitment. That's okay. We're still friends. I live life.\n\nPhysically, I am able to live life. But mentally I'm afraid. I feel like everything is new to me still and I don't know who to talk to. My friends are aware I am afraid of an ex but they don't understand how rooted they were to me. They were half of my conscious life. That's hard to swallow. The manipulative abuse drives my head in circles sometimes. I'm free physically. But I'm not free mentally just yet. \n\n",

        "text": "Ive had a very bad past few months. I'm pretty ashamed to say i wrote a letter to my nparents and mailed it asking for contact again.\n\nA bit of background: two months ago a good friend from work killed himself. In the same week my mother in law passed. I was at the hospital for the full four days of her passing and my husbands family would not let me see her. It was the toughest time of my life. Through all the abuse ive been through, not seeing my mother in law before she passed was a waking hell. I cried in the chapel for 3 of the 4 days.  Im still angry about it but the rage has died down. Ill simply never forgive his step father. \n\nAnyway ive been nc for almost 2 years. Jan 2018 will be 2 years. I wrote a letter which was advised by my therapist (in no way the same one i wrote. It was suppose to be full of boundaries and speaking why i did what i did. More of a closure letter than what it turned out to be... a cry for parents i dont have) the letter i wrote was full of sadness and regret. Wishing i had family...reaching out.\n\nFast forward to 2 months later... i never got a reply back. I dont know why i expected one. However, i saw my father at my work... i work with the public... and he saw me and kept walking. Why this is a big deal i got back in touch with my grandma (his mom) to have some kind of family. She was the only one who didn't make a big deal of me being married and all. (Both parents hate my husband for no reason) \n\nMy grandmother told me she has always believed my mother was controlling my father and he just lets her because he loves her. She told me she was sad what happened and she was genuinely happy to hear from me and that i should try to just talk to my dad by himself. See if he felt the way my mother did. (I brought it uo begore her. She only asked if i had any contact and didnt ask for details when i said no) I wanted to try low contact first, its what my therapist recommended. My grandmother never pushed for me to talk to either only listened and told me what she thought and if i said i was uncomfortable she accepted it. It was honestly eye opening. My mother always said she was stupid and having a long conversation i didnt see that at all. \n\nAnyway... I wanted to try low contact... but my mother and father are both ignoring me... i just wanted to share the pain of this. It reopened everything. I literally feel like ive just cut them out again. Seeing my dad at work ignore me, devasted me. I had to try and not burst into tears. Im their only child.  \n\nTl;dr; lost mother in law and good friend in same week two months ago. Wrote nc parents a reconnection letter. Never got a reply.  Saw father at work he ignored me. Reconnected with grandmother who is awesome. Feel extremely stupid and hurt.",

        "text": "The past 5 years I've been with my husband. We have been married for 2,5 years. After about 4 months the weirdness started, followed by a depression on my side (I battled myself out of this!). When I got over my depression I decided I could handle his weird tantrums and sort of laugh them off. \nA year ago our son was born. During my pregnancy I suddenly started to really realize that something was off and that it wasn't just me or \"my fault\". We went on vacation with some friends and he had some very weird hurtful interactions with them and also with me (pushing me away in my pregnant belly once). I knew then that I didn't want my son to grow up like him.\nAbout 4 months ago he left for vacation for three weeks and in that time I suddenly came back alive! We separated for a little while, but a week after he came back from vacation he decided it was enough and came back to our house. Even though I was initially aware of what was happening, somehow in these past months he has made his way back to making me feel guilty and like I am the crazy one.\nNow I have finally told him I want to separate for a while. He got mad, told me some very hurtful things and in the end threw his ring at me and walked out.\nNow he is back at the apartment and refuses to find another place  to stay (he is in my country on a relationship permit. the second we are registered in different places he has to leave), but what is worse, he also makes me not go anywhere. I'e been trying to find a solution together, because we have our son and for the moment he still adores him and the other way around too. I want to give him the option to stay in our son's life and become a citizen here, but I feel so utterly stuck. \nFor now I've arranged for my son and me to stay at my grandmother's for a while (going to break that news to him tonight). I just heard from his ex that when she tried to leave once he got physical and grabbed her by the throat, so by now I am pretty scared that he will react badly. Anyway... I don't really have a question, just wanted to share this, cause I feel so so lonely. I've told my close family and friends, but i guess that if you haven't experienced it, you really don't know what it's like... to question your own mind and sanity, to walk on eggshells non stop cause something might trigger some irrational outburst, the constant guilt tripping. I am so done with it and just want to move on...",

I will do my best to keep it short and sweet.\n\nMy covert NMom that I'm LC with has a lot of money and has always been very controlling. I was her scapegoat. Obviously her verbal and sometimes physical abuse took a toll on me, and I allowed my grades to suffer. Dad was no help and I didn't think to seek help elsewhere. For a long time I thought things would improve on their own somehow.\n\nOnce I got a job, moved out and had some college credits under my belt, my happiness level soared. I mistakenly thought all of my demons had been put to rest. I spread myself too thin and kept dropping my classes. I thought I could handle working and going to school, but I couldn't. I wasn't strong enough to set boundaries and, unfortunately, kept making the same bad decisions term after term.\n\nFast forward 5 years later, I'm ready to go back to school and I know I have what it takes. I applied for aid a couple years ago right after turning 24 and was denied because I'd already exceeded the attempted credit limit. Now I'm afraid I'll have to take out loans. Has anyone been in this situation and successfully appealed the decision? I know my bad choices are my own, but I've never received money from the government before a I wonder if that would work in my favor.\n\nX-posted to /r/raisedbynarcissists",

        "text": "So, my therapist posed me this questions this week and I started crying profusely. I really don't know. My therapist says he finds it through meditation and through his spiritual practice most of all. He said he finds it through his marriage, but not completely. For example his wife could die. Significant others aren't permanent, as lovely as they are. \n\nMy life is completely chaotic. I'm doing well in college, but studying something notoriously difficult. My life is planned out via Google calendar. I keep a daily planner, and track my study time. I'm a great student, but it is stressful. \n\nMeanwhile back in my hometown, my Nmom is suing my dad, and my dad is suing her in return. My younger brother is really being affected. I was always the one to rise above my circumstances, but for him it's proving too much. It's sad honestly. I want him to prosper with me. He likely will not be going to college. \n\nThe closest thing to inner peace I've found is being with my boyfriend. I love him completely and dearly, and I picture us together for years to come. But as my therapist pointed out, that peace is not coming from myself. \n\nAnother contender would be spending time with my best friend of 6 years. I love her so much, and we share such a special and deep bond. But we could get into a fight. She could move away. Lots of things could happen.\n\nI'm a very high-strung, nervous person. Always in flight or flight, always using work and overachievement to numb my pain. \n\nI see one possible source of inner peace though, and that would be building my own life, away from that of my family. When I graduate college, I'll be financially independent (hard degrees pay off). I'd love a cozy little apartment with my boyfriend and maybe a cat or two. I could invite our friends over for dinner, and let them know how much I love them and care about them. But this could never happen ultimately, it is just a dream. \n\nHow do YOU find inner peace? I want feedback from as many people as possible. ",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAfterNarcissism/comments/76jl8y/how_am_i_supposed_to_move_on_when_i_share_child/",
        "text": "So, [this](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/may/20/coercion-and-control-fighting-against-the-abuse-hidden-in-relationships)    article majorly triggered me for some reason today.  Can I just vent for a minute, or maybe someone has some sort of helpful insight to share??  This is going to be such a long rant, I'm sorry, I just need it OUT of my system.  Is there a sub for co parenting with these types of people??  \n\nMy ex literally did *all* of these things in the article (besides murder someone).  He isn't diagnosed, but he ticks off nearly all of the boxes for BPD besides self harm.. and he also meets *all* of the NPD criteria.  He seems like a really bad mix of both disorders.  If he were to see a therapist and be *totally honest*, he would probably be diagnosed NPD.  \n\nWe have a 10 year old together.  While he was initially ordered supervised visitation with a therapist.. long term, the courts eventually granted him standard visitation with no restrictions.  He still emotionally abuses him and I can't do anything to stop it.  He has the upper hand financially, and would have me jailed for not complying with the visitation order if I withheld visits.  Literally the only way I have to stop the abuse is to take our kid and run away/hide.  This isn't even remotely possible for me.  He would eventually track me down and I would be held in contempt of court.. Then he would have sole custody.  I do also have other children and would jeopardize their well being if I became a fugitive in contempt of court.  Unless I hid out in the mountains somewhere, off grid, he would find me.  \n\nWhile I was married to him,  about 90% of his abuse was not physical (which is why I justified, downplayed and denied it for so long).  His physical abuse towards the kids was 'discipline' (spankings gone way too far leaving bruises).  He also broke things, punched holes in the wall and yelled/screamed.  He had a very explosive, unpredictable temper.  Since I have left him, he has almost entirely cut out all physical abuse (now he is suddenly able to control himself I guess). However.. he still withholds meals from our 10 year old, out of spite towards me.  I realize this isn't rational and I can't explain his reasoning behind it.. but for example, if I don't feed him lunch before he is picked up for his visits on Sundays (we leave the house around 11:15 am, so he hasn't always eaten lunch by then), my ex will then feed him lunch but *refuse* to feed him dinner.  Despite the fact that we don't pick him up and get him home until around 7:30-8:00 pm.  His reasoning is that I am 'taking advantage' of him by making him feed our kid meals that *I* should be responsible for.  I know it's irrational.  He also skips feeding him meals regularly during his full weekends (Friday through Sunday, every other weekend).  From what I gather, it's because they just eat without him while he is in his room playing (he is pretty much confined to his bedroom for the majority of the visit, unless they have plans to go somewhere).  The meal skipping is what originally prompted the CPS calls from his teachers, starting in kindergarten.  Also for context, our son is underweight (barely 60 pounds at nearly 11 years old).  My ex gets *angry* at me for feeding him weight gain shakes, and was absolutely livid when we put him on an appetite stimulating medication.  I always relent and pull the meds/supplements because he takes it out on our son and mind fucks with him until he's a mess for days.  This is also why I have always pulled him from therapy in the past.. because he gets so *angry* about it and it makes our son a mental wreck.  He bed wet and peed on the floor of his room for months after starting therapy again 2 years ago.  He is very obviously impacted by this.  \n\nDespite having CPS called on him every year since I left him, for several years, (from teachers and therapists, not me), they close out every investigation as 'unfounded' because they can't *prove* any physical abuse.  Eventually the teachers and therapists stopped reporting it, because none of it was considered physical abuse, and all the CPS investigations did was make him worse towards his kid (mentally).  He would accuse our son of making up stories, or accuse him of being brainwashed by me in some plot to ruin my ex's life. There would be hours-long interrogations at the dinner table (I know this is 100% true, because he did this with my older kids when they would come home from visits with *their* dad.. he would sit them down and grill them about what they did at Dad's, what they said about him, who their dad was with and analyze/rehash every single thing that was said and done).  He basically forces our son to validate that he is the 'better' and 'preferred' parent.. and punishes him with anger if he expresses *any* love or attachment to me.  I know this sounds insane.. He also grills him about what he is saying to the teachers, to the counselors, whether he is seeing any new therapists, whether they have him on medications etc.  He also becomes insanely angry over the medication issue, even though our son has pretty severe ADHD and *needs* medications.  He is currently seeing a therapist and on meds, against his dad's wishes.. our son is hiding the ADHD med usage from his dad because he is afraid of his reaction.  Therapists and teachers know this is what's going on.. and again, no one can do anything but watch it happen.  He also completely undermines the teachers and therapists.. He calls them incompetent, accuses them of being in on some sort of conspiracy to ruin his life because I make up lies about my ex being abusive and they are too stupid to see the truth.....  They have all tried to reach out to my ex btw, but he refuses to meet with them or even return phone calls.  He honestly believes that they are all bad and incompetent, out to use everything he says or does against him.. that it's some sort of conspiracy against men by feminists to take child custody from fathers.  *I know this is insane and irrational*.  He is pretty much a stereotypical incel.  Please don't ask me why I ever put up with him.. I don't know why.  Codependency and history of significant childhood abuse?  I can't explain it and I'm ashamed that I had a child with this person (however, he did sabotage my birth control to conceive him, then refused to allow me to give him up for adoption).  \n\nCPS is a total dead end.  Without 'proof of harm', there isn't anything that can be done to shield my kid from his craziness.  There's no longer any proof of physical abuse.  That's really all the courts care about at the end of the day.  I have also consulted with an attorney again on the visitation and confirmed that unless he is physically harming our son, I really can't do anything.  I can't even move away out of the court's jurisdiction.  My ex would fight me to the death if I left the state.  Not out of love for his kid, but because that would be me controlling my own life.  He loves having our kid as leverage against me.  Sometimes I truly wonder if he is purposely fucking his head up, so that he 'fails' as an adult and he can blame it on my horrible parenting.  Through our kid, he can still keep tabs on what's going on with my life, and use our court ordered visitation to keep me stuck in this state where he knows I don't want to be.  \n\nWhen we were married, he essentially forced me into quitting my job to take care of the kids (because he would have explosive outbursts when left alone with them- like punching a hole in our baby's door because he wouldn't nap, and pounding his fist down on a glass top computer desk so hard that it shattered everywhere, or destroying the kids' toys in anger).  He also accused me of sleeping with my boss and co workers *all the time*.  If I wasn't sleeping with them, I 'wanted' to or was planning on it.  My 'slutty' work clothes proved my intentions.  It ended up easier to just stay at home.  Anyways, I have chronic migraines that make working a full time job *very* difficult for me.  He used my SAHM status against me as proof of me 'mooching' off him or using him for his money (he wasn't wealthy by any means, but he was comfortably well off).  \n\nHe refused to 'allow' me to open a bank account and wouldn't put my name on his bank account.  He was genuinely angry when I opened up my own bank account towards the end of the marriage.  He invaded my privacy by looking through my emails, PM's, texts and browser history.  He accused me of shady things all the time (like cheating, planning to leave him, stealing his money or plotting to steal everything he owned).  I had no assets when I left him besides a very meager amount in my checking account.  I ended up maxing out credit cards when I left him in order to start over.  Also, for the record, I *never* cheated on him or planned to or wanted to.  I was barely alive when I was with him.  Definitely wasn't looking to bring another person into my life.  \n\nHe did our home loan in his name only and refused to put me on the title/deed.  He actually had them *redo* the title because they had assumed his wife would be on it too.. He named his *mom* beneficiary to his life insurance policy at work.  All of our vehicles were in his name only.  When I left him, I also left behind our house and vehicles.  I took nothing in form of alimony or assets.  I do receive child support.  My ex tells our kid *all the time* about how bad I 'screwed him over', how I took everything he owned and ruined him financially.. That didn't even happen.  And even if it had happened exactly as he is saying.. why would you tell this to a 10 year old???  He gets angry when our son speaks of me or my current husband or my other kids.  He punishes him with anger and rants and accusations of not being loyal to him.  He creates this weird 'rivalry' where he's pitting our son against myself and my other kids.. like he's pushing this narrative that my other older kids are bad influences who don't care about him, that we *all* don't care about him and we all just want him to be unhappy.  Not that I have to defend against this, but my other kids are normal kids.. not some monster brats like my ex always proclaims.  My oldest is an adult in college and the other is a very normal 15 year old without any major behavioral problems.  \n\nI am so fucking tired of it.  I am literally watching another person destroy my kid, destroy his spirit.. and I can't stop it.  \n\n",

        "text": "(**Although I understand for some people this would be a \"happy\" thing, please don't congratulate me on his death, although he was not a good person, it has still been a huge loss and very emotionally trying**)\n\nIt's taken me a few weeks to write this, it's been a hard go. To put things in perspective, I'm getting married - really soon - and I got the call while doing a wedding activity with family that Ndad killed himself. He struggled with mental illness for decades and had had  many suicide attempts over the years but this time there was no indication he was suicidal (in the past we always were aware of the decline as we knew the signs). \n\nHis N-gf was the one that told me, she called me - the police Sgt was very angry she called, it was not her responsibility to notify me, he made it clear he wasn't pleased (I had cut off contact with Ndad's N-gf as well because she is one of the most toxic people I have ever met in my life). When I found out he had killed himself, it felt like I had every bit of air sucked out of me, I couldn't speak or breathe. I handed the phone to my sibling because I was crumbling, I couldn't understand what was happening. In true narc fashion, handing off the phone irritated N-gf and she snapped at my sibling because I couldn't announce to her why I was handing the phone over (how I hate that woman).\n\nThe last few weeks have been chaotic. Although I was NC, I helped with the planning and estate, I just couldn't bring myself to leave it on the shoulders of my siblings, like me, they were/are destroyed.\n\nI can't go into details because it could lead to me being identified but because of his living situation, we had to move his belongings in less than three days after we were notified. Guess what his N-gf did 12 hrs after he was pronounced? She called us (his children) and asked for every single item of value in the apartment because she bought it for him (money was a huge component in their relationship, she is famous for buying people, and I'm ashamed to say my father exploited that despite raising us to NEVER do that to someone). We gave her everything she wanted - I know many wouldn't have but I was willing to sacrifice the few items of value that he had just to get that horrible hate filled woman out of my life. It still bothers me though, how the hell can you think about belongings like that so soon after he's dead? It disgusts me.\n\nSince then, there have been many ups and downs. The anxiety I now have is so high. I am better today than I was earlier in the week but I'm still not great. I have always had severe anxiety about death, now it's worse. Fuck.\n\nI feel guilty for mourning - do I have a right to mourn? I went NC two years ago because I just couldn't cope with the abuse any longer. Did he do it because he wasn't invited to the wedding? Is it my fault for not trying harder? Was this meant to be one final \"fuck you\" to the daughter he hated for taking a stand, knowing my wedding was soon? Why does it hurt so bad? Why am I still so sad? When will the pain stop?\n\nI have the number for a bereavement counselor but I haven't called yet, on top of the death anxiety, I have dealt with issues with phone calls for easily 15yrs (in part because of Ndad) and now that has worsened too.\n\nI don't want Ndad to have this much power over me but right now, I feel like I'll never get over this. I feel like he's in my head again. The nightmares are back, I hate feeling like this when I'm supposed to be excited about our upcoming wedding. Why won't it stop hurting?",

By the summer I was leaving the house, by September I was volunteering - a shift a week working the front desk at an acupuncture clinic and an afternoon a week in a dress shop - and i help people but i have $5.30 in my checking and my card got declined at Goodwill.  I used to have a salary.  Benefits.  I dropped everything in my life to be a \"good daughter\".\n\nI'm just so effing tired.  My mind is so tired.  High functioning processes are being taken up by keeping track of my keys and that's barely happening.  Can I just take a long rest, like Data from star trek, can someone reboot me?\n\nI'm so sick of it some times.   Like a lot of the time I'm hugely grateful for waking up and the growth etc but sometimes I just can't take another step.  And because of what I would eventually learned where flying monkeys and other various winged beasts I have had to block every last relative.  Only child.  Last of my line (back of hand to forehead)\n\nI'll leave us on a positive note - my therapist shocked and amazed me this week by telling me that I have what it takes to open a small donation based niche practice to help people who don't know what codependence is / inner child / haven't even begun to unpack/recover.  That she would send me referrals.  I don't get my hopes up for stuff but .... I like to tease myself sometimes... \n\nthank you, honestly, for being there to understand",

I work in a popular, casual restaurant in my hometown and had a double today. Not only did they say to go home during my first shift, but my manager took me outside during my second one about two hours in and told me hebcould tell something was up.\n\nI had been holding back tears all shift. Trying my best. I'm usually a badass, take care of all the other servers and just generally want to make everything smooth as possible, and everyones job easier.. serving is tiring on a lot of different levels. Usually I'm really fast and hardworking (to toot my own horn haha.. but really I put in 100% consistently!). \n\nSo after the incident last night  (see the RBN post, sorry if that's the wrong format or anything), I have been reeling. It's always been bad but not like that. When I tried to tell her to get help with her drinking, she said \"boo hoo, you called me a shitty mom [I didn't say that, she was gaslighting], now you will see what a shitty mom really is.\"\n\nI didn't respond. I blocked her. I kept my Estepdad on Facebook. He tried to stop her from hitting me and choking me, but he makes her drinks so goddamn strong that she's wasted within two glasses of a \"vodka and sprite\" (mostly vodka and a splash of sprite). \n\nShe had me by my neck and I opened the door to her apartments and yelled for someone to call the police. It was midnight, and I left to the streets where a cop finally picked me up. As I said in my post, I'm a reasonably attractive, 130 pound woman. On the streets at night in my pajamas. She made me feel it was safer to be out there than at my own mother's home.\n\nMy boyfriend is amazing and is a traveling musician so he's in the Midwest currently. I'm in the southeast. He's been there for me as much as possible, but it's been hard not having my best friend here, and it affected my work today.\n\nI'm just wondering how to proceed to get to an LAN point. Any advice or suggestions are welcome and appreciated!\n\nEdit: grammar",

She emailed me a picture of herself and her 1-year-old baby, declaring their love for me and explained the purpose of her contact was due to Trump potentially starting a nuclear war. I knew this was yet another play for me to break NC and ignored it. Yesterday, my aunt (who's extremely close to my NSister) posted on my FB timeline \"So sad, you haven't yet found peace...\".\n\nEnraged, I posted something along the lines of \"So sad you can't be neutral. Let's be honest, if you gave a shit about me you would have asked about me instead of ignorantly making assumptions based upon the opinions of other people whose interests you represent. You don't know anything about my life, and that's probably for the best. Hope you are well.\" After about an hour without a reply, I unfriended and blocked her on FB. I know that I shouldn't have written back, but being that this was a flying monkey it wasn't quite breaking NC. What I find to be ironic in her assumption that I haven't found peace is that it is my NMother and NSister who are haunted by my NC, and as a result do not have peace. My NC deflates their narcissistic supply, and they cannot let it go because they have not \"won\". Fuck them.",

Mother - who did nothing to defend me. My brothers didn't care - one was a Narc and I later found out his 'defense' was manipulating me. My grandparents all died. \n\nMy friends, I haven't seen in years. I don't even have any because all I know how to do is fake emotion. \n\nI lost any jobs I might have had. \n\nHow can you go outside, when even going outside for ten minutes is taxing?\n\nHow do you sit through a job. \n\nI'm looking at my options, and coming up blank. \n\nI used to read - can't. Watch TV - can't. Listen to music - too triggering. Pets - unavailable/can't get them where I live/can't petsit because of animals already here (that don't like me, btw). I could die in my room and no one would care. \n\nI have trouble eating enough as it is, it wouldn't take much, I know for me to have a heart attack. I might be pre-empting it, to be honest. \n\nI've never had anyone who talked to me, bothered to get to know me...\n\nMy counsellor died six months ago, and she seemed to give a damn, but they wouldn't tell me how and I only saw her for two months, so I know it's my fault...I don't know how I know but I do. \n\nI'm exhausted. My hair is falling out, and I've spent my life neglected and abused. Now, I'm old with no viable skills or means to implement them - no way to get into a relationship, have a career or fulfill my dreams. I can't do much, but I can do this. I'm sorry for putting this out there - I'm sorry for everything. \n\nThe last \"friendship\" I had - the last person who \"cared\" was really a Narc in disguise....or something - he decided I was selfish in the end, then turned on me...kept apologizing and stuff, but I was tired of walking on eggshells, and he'd get angry if I \"ignored\" him (which I had to explain, was because I was afraid he'd get angry at me). \n\nI wonder if there's a time when you have to accept what happened, and deal with it accordingly. I always imagined I was the exception - we all do, but the trauma runs and runs, around in my head - any glimmer of hope gone, and what I wanted - to put it behind me and live a 'normal' life - not let it define me, write the ending to my own story and live with this as a bad memory, a haunting dream...is gone. I guess I have to live traumatized, but I never wanted this story to be sad, so I don't know what to do. \n\nI really sometimes think that one person reaches their threshold, and that's it. I don't know if that's me, but it certainly looks like it. I can't take the anger, and the neglect. I want to end my life. ",

If I could still function, it didn't count. \n\nI was pretty floored when I went to a doctor and he said I had to take a few days off for a virus. In my mind, I wasn't visibly sick, so it didn't count. Ditto, when someone told me to rest with a fever. \n\nAlso, it gets mixed up, because my parents told me I was 'sick' a lot, or needing 'help', so maybe it sends me into a flashback or something? \n\nMy head's a mess, so this post is a mess, but basically yeah - sickness is no fun, and makes me think of N Mom when I 'complain' about it. I can't tell if something is serious or all in my head. I can't tell what's physical illness or mental exhaustion. \n\nI feel like I'm dying all the time, and I don't know what to do:/ I'm afraid of hospitals, because I'm afraid they'll drag me away, or it'll get back to my N parents and they'll overreact or make it proof that I'm 'ill' and needing their help. How do you maintain boundaries and realistic peace of mind when you're 'sick'? \n\nPlease, any help would be appreciated. Thanks again for reading. \n\nx\n\n(**TL;DR** How do you maintain your peace of mind when 'illness' is a huge trigger for you, and what do you do when N parents had enmeshment/boundary issues around illness and constantly complained that they were dying so you don't know what's illness, what's serious, and what's trivial/okay) As a bonus, how do you deal with emotional flashbacks that come from experiencing physical illness/aches and pains? What do you feel is appropriate to share? I tend not to tell people I'm sick - I don't want to worry them. I think this is okay, and not a RBN trait (just general courtesy and 'grit'(?) I guess?), but I'd be interested to know your responses.)\n\nx\n\n",

I wish I could show more compassion to family or friends when they are hurting. I’ve lost the ability to understand, listen or know what to say if it comes to that. \n\nI know it’s part depression and part not learning it from nmom. I need a role model who can teach me the right way to human. \n\nI do care. \n\n\n\n",

        "text": "The title may make this sound like a kind of weird thing to post on a narcissistic abuse support forum, but allow me to explain.\n\nIf I meet somebody, and I discover that they have narcissistic parents, they **have** to be aware of what's going on and either actively attempting to escape their grasp or already escaped their grasp. Otherwise, I cannot talk to them. I cannot talk to people who describe the actions and behaviors of their narcissistic parents but are unaware of the abusive situation they're in, or they are unable to escape them, for whatever reason.\n\nFor example, I talked to somebody online once who seemed somewhat depressed. They said their room was way too cold. I asked them why they're not turning up the heat. They replied something like \"somebody will find a reason to yell at me for some reason...\" with 'somebody' referring to their parents, whom they lived with. (There were more symptoms than just that.) I could not continue communication with this person. They were likely in an abusive situation and unaware of it. I'm recovering from my own abusive past, and I need to meet emotionally healthy people; I don't have the mental time or energy to try and 'wake up' somebody who has likely internalized their abuse and is unaware of it. It hits too close to home.\n\nObviously this doesn't really apply when I come to r/RBN or r/LAN because it's a website and I know what I'm getting into, also most if not all people on here are aware of their abusive situations. **This only applies to interpersonal relationships.** Does anybody else feel this way?",
