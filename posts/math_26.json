        "text": "I will not describe the original claim, which is very well known. If you aren't familiar with it, Wikipedia \"Russell's Paradox\" gives a lengthy description. \n\nThere are assumptions here. \n\nLet's start with a similar assumption. Every English sentence has an intrinsic meaning which must be true or false. But no, it isn't true that every grammatical English sentence has meaning. What a stupid thing to assume. \n\nWe divide things up into categories. Into groups. Is there some law that requires that every way we define a group must automatically say whether everything that could exist will be inside or outside the group? Of course not. For example, I could define a group as follows: Everything in the world that is green or blue goes into my group, and everything which is not blue or green is excluded from my group, except for blue parakeets and green asparagus which are neither included nor excluded. \n\nIf I can make a group that doesn't decide everything on purpose, can I do it by accident? Of course. \n\nIf I define a malformed group, that doesn't mean there's something wrong with logic. It means there's something wrong with my definition. So if I care, I can patch up malformed definitions.\n\nHeterological1: The set of all sets that do not include themselves, plus the heterological1 set itself. \n\nHeterological2: The set of all sets that do not include themselves, but not the heterological2 set itself. \n\nThen use whichever definition is more useful to you. \n\nIf you find that you have been using a malformed group, you can patch it up. Problem solved! \n\nThe fact that you can make definitions of sets that do not actually define whether everything is in the set or not, is not particularly remarkable. Somehow, somebody assumed that every grammatical sentence must have a platonic pre-existing meaning that we can discover, and that meaning must be precise. This whole mess came from that assumption.\n\nAm I wrong?",

I've learned languages, which is a blast, but ultimately the goal is to use it to speak to people in that language. In creative hobbies there is obviously an end product. I love games and sports, where the appeal is obvious. But I have no idea what people into math really \"do\" that gives them pleasure. Do you just solve pre-written problems? Measure and calculate stuff you think of in the world? Just go further and further into abstract theoretical stuff until your brain explodes?\n\nDoes anyone consider math a hobby in itself, or is it just a tool for other interests/hobbies?

The uniqueness of limits is because a continuous map is determined by its values on any dense subset. The fact that f(a\\_1),f(a\\_2),... converges to f(L) when f is continuous is just composition of continuous functions. This happened to occur to me today because I was thinking about how x,f(x),f(f(x)),... always limits to a fixed point of x when f is continuous.",

I was thinking of getting into Mathematics because my Maths skills are quite poor, I can do integration, differentiation and matrix manipulation, with some CS Maths like combinatorics and boolean maths. I was thinking of doing a part-time BSc in Mathematics at the Open University and then do a part-time Master's in Pure Mathematics at Imperial College London. I know this will be super difficult so I'm allowing myself up to about 10 years to do all this. Fortunately, the government fully funds a part-time Bachelor's degree in Maths (even if I do only did one module a year), although I may do the first year full-time as it's mostly a recap of A Level and I did well at A Level Maths.\n\nIn the future I'd like to use my Maths skills to eventually either go into Quant, Machine Learning or Quantum Computing (I may do MSc Applied Mathematics if that's better). Big reason I want to do Pure Mathematics is that I really want to think like a mathematician and mould my brain into thinking logically and doing rigorous proof (which is a lot of what I do in CS and software development). Plus the Maths skills will help be to be a better developer, go into research and prove to myself that I can be good at Maths.\n\nIs this feasible, reasonable? Am I being unrealistic and overestimating my abilities?",

It seems that the simplest way is to determine the longest side and subtract the square of another side from it.  If the result is the square of the other side, obviously the Pythagorean formula is true, so it's a right triangle.  But that requires me to square all of the sides.  If I have a 3-4-5 triangle, that's easy.  But I have a triangle where the sides are 42.42640687, 19.20937271, and 48.46648326.  \n\nNow, I have these numbers in Excel because I got a weird answer and wanted to check it using Heron's formula.  So working the Pythagorean theorem, I found out that it was not a right triangle.   But is there a way to do that trigonometrically with only two sides?  I can pick any two sides, divide one by the other, and use arccos, arcsin, or arctan to find the smaller angles.  But I can't figure out how to find the largest angle without using the Law of Cosines, which again requires me to find all three angles.  \n\ncos(C) = (a\\^2 + b\\^2 - c\\^2) / (2 \\* a \\* b)\n\nI suppose if I were a glutton for punishment I could translate one of those angles into the other two.\n\ncos(C) = (a\\^2 + b\\^2 - (180 - a - b)\\^2) / (2 \\* a \\* b)\n\nBut that's stupid.",

        "text": "Just a recap so we're all on the same page. I'm referring to the proof that assumes (0,1) is countable, then constructing a decimal number that differs from all the other decimal numbers in at least one place.\n\nAssume that we've formed the sequence (a₁ , a₂ ,...) so that a₁ differs from the first decimal in the first place, a₂  differs from the second decimal in the second place, etc.\n\nIn the usual proof, it simply jumps and says consider the decimal number that can be written as 0.a₁a₂... and this clearly isn't in the countable list of decimals.\n\nThe problem is this decimal number hasn't been formally constructed. We can do so using limits of the series bₙ = sum of aᵢ10⁻ⁱ where i is from 1 to n. If we take the limit of this series as n approaches infinity, then it doesn't converge to a decimal number. If we assume that it converges to a decimal number L, the problem is that there exists an m such that the mᵗʰ decimal place of L is not aₘ, so any epsilon less than this difference will fail the limit definition. Thus, this limit does not lie in (0,1).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlternatively, let Uₙ be the set of all real numbers that differ from n in at least one decimal place. Clearly, n is not in Uₙ. Let V be the intersection of all Uₘ for all m in (0,1). Since m is not in Uₘ, clearly (0,1) is not a subset of V, and thus there does not exist a number in (0,1) that differs in at least one decimal place from every other number in (0,1).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, since we can't conclude that the created decimal is in (0,1), we can't say that there's a number in (0,1) that's not included in the countable list.",

Our local competition takes place next weekend, so after that I just want to use the rest of the time to generate as much interest in math as possible. I'm looking for a recreational math book to aid with this goal.\n\nI was thinking about Martin Gardner's \"The Colossal Book of Mathematics\", but having never read it, didn't know how much would be accessible to my club (or at least translatable to something we could explore). There is a wide range of mathematical knowledge in the group, from average 6th graders to a few 8th graders that are years ahead of their peers. Any suggestions would be highly appreciated. Thanks!",
