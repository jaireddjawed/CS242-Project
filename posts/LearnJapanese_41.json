I need participants of all different levels so all are welcome, and I hope it will provide a nice opportunity for you to reflect on your learning experiences until now. \n\n\nI look forward to reading all of your responses! ありがとうございます！\n\nEdit: Thank you to everyone who has participated and everyone who’s given feedback, I’ve now closed the survey. I’ve had a much greater response than I ever could have hoped for and I really appreciate everyone’s effort. I’ve got a lot to analyse and write up but as soon as I finish I’ll be sure to post the results for you all to read 🙂\n\n",

The registration is being handled by the Japan Foundation in Toronto, apparently, and it was delayed for over a week beyond its scheduled opening due to \"technical problems\". An email went out today to those who had asked to be notified about the availability of the registration form, asking people to register and providing a URL. At present, the form is http-only; if you fill it in, you will be sending your personal information in the clear. It's not available on https. Worse than this, if you complete the form with personal details (as I did, gritting my teeth), you'll be directed to a second form asking for your credit card info, ALSO NOT ENCRYPTED. That one, of course, I didn't complete.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've emailed the person responsible asking for guidance on how to pay securely, but I haven't heard anything back yet. Meanwhile, if you're tempted to complete this form, do think twice about it. The fact that it's so poorly-executed suggests that the people who set it up really don't know what they're doing, and they may perhaps be as cavalier with the credit card info they receive as they are being in the process of getting it.",

From the start I used memries and I am currently close to finishing all there Courses (Japanese 1-7).\n\nEarly on, I was bugged by the fact that many Vocabulary Repetition Apps do not provide all the information I needed so I had to look all Words up at [Jisho.org](https://jisho.org/).\n\nTo make my studying more efficiently, I created an App for Android!\n\n[Example Vocabulary](https://i.redd.it/ytj4t8kdbto11.png)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have been using it for half a year now and I just released it to the Google Play Store. I think especially for intermediate and Expert Students of Japanese this App might be worth a look. The App contains all commonly used Japanese words (including Audio), so you can add specifically the ones you want to learn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe App is free for download and can be found here: [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jlpt.save\\_jeff.jd\\_jlpt](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jlpt.save_jeff.jd_jlpt)\n\nThe App is  ad-free and there is a pro version (around 3-4$). \n\nI offer a discount for this subreddit. Just go to Settings and scroll down to \"Discount\" and enter\n\n&gt;LearnJapanese\n\nto get 50% off ;\\]\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe App contains Word Bundles for beginners like Genki Lections and i will be adding other Study Lists later on.\n\nIt also tracks your Progress within the JLPT Levels and many more (i hope) usefull features.\n\nIn the future, I'm planning to add a feature for importing the Satori Review Cards.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would love to hear if you like it and feedback is welcome ;\\]\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*(Post was approved by Mod)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

        "text": "I considered putting this in Shitsumonday, but I think it's a broad enough (and common enough) topic for its own thread.\n\nWhen you first start out learning vocab, there are very few homophones or near-homophones to deal with, so each word seems very distinct and clear. There are a small number of specific counterexamples, like how とし can mean either 都市 or 年, both of which are super common beginner words. Most of the time, though, when you learn a word at the beginner level, it's the only one that's pronounced/defined/written that way, so you can associate pronunciation/definition/writing of the word 1-to-1-to-1.\n\nFast-forward a year or two into your studies, though, and you'll find a TON of other words are pronounced the same way as those early words that were so easy. はち means \"eight\", and is often the eighth word learned, but you might find out much later that it can also mean \"bee\", which can interfere with your ability to recall the original meaning that you learned.\n\nPersonally, I find this interference to be even worse with on-readings. When I first learned, say, 中小, it was super easy because ちゅう and しょう only meant 中 and 小 to me, so it was obvious every time i read/heard it that ちゅうしょう must mean 中小. But, now I know so many kanji with either of these readings that it's difficult to recognize the obvious. I've misidentified きゅうしゅう an embarrassing number of times, and that was one that I knew before I ever started studying Japanese! There are just so many other kanji for きゅう and しゅう that I have a hard time coming up with 九州, as obvious as that SHOULD be. きゅうじゅう, ちゅうきゅう, しこう, and a bunch of others are the same way for me, especially since I also know vocab words that are mirror images of them: じゅうきゅう, きゅうちゅう, and こうし all interfere with their counterparts from the beginning of this sentence. \n\nSo, what's your strategy for dealing with this?\n\n(By the way, just to prevent the conversation from going this way, I should point out that I am perfectly capable of recognizing these words IN CONTEXT...however, I firmly believe that if you can't recognize a word OUT of context, you do not actually know that word. Sausage. See? I wasn't even talking about food and you recognized that...my goal is to achieve the same level of recognition for all my vocab words.)",

The stories cover topics from being bullied, to crazy things that happened during their jobs, being a single mother, friendship experiences, having money issues, getting married and even being cheated on. There are about 40 categories in all, and each has around 6 to 20 stories.\n\nThe stories are so addictive to read, quite short in length (maybe 70\\~100 sentences each?) and there are so many of them. Since they're 体験談 from random everyday people, they're written with very useful, everyday language. Farming sentences or vocab from it if you're into that wouldn't be a bad idea at all.\n\nI've found some of these stories to be quite relateable. Here's an excerpt from a story by a woman who has been called ugly by random people multiple times in her life and how it's affected her. This is about 1/3 of the story (feel free to skip it, only read some, or just check out the site for yourself for a story you're interested in!):\n\n高校を卒業した私は、地元を離れ、同じ高校からは誰も進学しなかった大学へ入学しました。\n\nとくに「高校時代の人間関係をリセットしたい」というような意図はありません。\n\n地元からは距離があることもあって、私以外は誰も、わざわざその大学を選ぼうとは思わなかったようです。\n\nそんなわけで私は、大学入学と同時に、人間関係を一からつくりあげなければならなくなりました。\n\n**しかし、これはコミュ障の私にとって、大変辛いことになったのです。**\n\n私が専攻していたのは心理学で、幸い同じ専修コースを選択していたのは20人ほど。\n\n「高校の1クラスよりも少ない人数なら、なんとか溶け込めるかもしれない」と思ったのです。\n\nしかし、容姿は残念でコミュ力も低く、学業もパッとしないため、同級生からの印象がかなり薄かった私。\n\nなかなか、仲のいい友だちはできませんでした。\n\n「どうしたらいいんだろうな」と悩みつつ、ひとりで学食にきたとき、ある会話を聞いてしまったんです。\n\nそれは、同じ心理学コースの男の子Aくんと、Bくんの会話でした。\n\n私が座った席は、ちょうど彼らのななめ後ろで、2人は私がそこにいることには気がついていなかったようです。\n\n話題は、どうやら心理学コースの親睦会のこと。\n\n2人が幹事になって開催しようと、メンバーをリストアップしているところのようでした。\n\n**すると、Aくんが「あの人はどうする？」と言い出したんです。**\n\n「あの人って誰よ」とBくん。\n\n「あのいつもひとつ結びの……、髪の毛くるくるしてる……」、どうやら名前が出てこない様子のAくん。\n\n私は「髪の毛くるくる」で、「間違いなく私のことだな」と考えていました。\n\n「あー、えーっとなんだっけ、名前忘れたな」と、うなるBくん。\n\nそんな会話に「私、私！」と出ていくことができれば良かったのでしょうが、もちろん私にそんな積極性はありません。\n\n**どうなることかと見守っていると、Aくんが「あのブスな人だよ」とぽつりとつぶやいたんです。**\n\nその直後Bくんに「おまえ、その言い方はないだろ」と怒られていたものの、その後2人の会話に出てきたのは、もちろん私の名前。\n\n「男性陣の共通認識としても、私はブスなんだなあ」と思うと、なんだか切ない気持ちに。\n\nそれがきっかけで、その後は大学で積極的に友だちをつくるのをやめてしまいました。",

It's not much yet, but has a new way of organizing flashcards that lets you study casually without needing to commit to a consistent schedule. I would appreciate your feedback on how to improve the app!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou can try it here:\n\n[https://hammer.app](https://hammer.app)\n\nIt works on desktop or mobile browsers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere are some screenshots:\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/k9nqucjsjno11.png\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHammer starts out like basic paper flashcards where you're just reviewing random cards, but it keeps track of which cards you get correct and arranges the deck so you spend more time reviewing the cards you don't know well. So, it's kind of like standard SRS, but not as strict.\n\nThe benefit is that you get some of the efficiency benefits of SRS, but you can study whenever you'd like and don't need to worry about keeping up with a daily review schedule. It works well if your study habits are inconsistent, or you need to cram quickly for an upcoming test or trip. There's also less pressure to get cards correct because you can make up for missed cards by simply studying longer.\n\nI also put in some gamification features, like a badge collection gacha system. They're just minor add-ons but it might make studying a bit more fun.\n\nYou can use the basic kana, kanji, or vocab premade decks included already, but it may work better if you create your own deck with a small list of words that you want to learn.",

I know hiragana, katakana and some kanji from TextFugu. So far, I really like this resource and I'm on season 4 with it. The only problem is that the textbook is not complete and it's successor, Eto Eto, doesn't look like it will ever be made. I recently bought the first volume of Japanese From Zero along with Kanji From Zero by George Trombley...however, I'm a little put off by how long the book takes to make you learn hiragana and how it's pre lessons require you to learn so much vocabulary without knowing how to write them in hiragana. I'm not sure if I'm wasting my time by trying to complete TextFugu or not though. I really like Koichi's style of teaching, especially how he explains things in fun, simple terms and how he breaks down exactly what to study. Also, I know most of you will tell me to switch to Genki but 1) I can't afford it and 2) I'm not sure it's style of teaching is right for me. It's been a long time since I've been in school and I never went to college. I'm mainly studying Japanese to further enjoy Japanese music, tv, video games and to be able to converse when I visit Japan in 2 years...so in short, I'm doing this for self enrichment. Genki seems like it would be very overwhelming (I have anxiety disorder) and hard to understand for someone like me. So, my questions are: \n\n1) Is completing TextFugu a waste of my time will doing TextFugu and then JFZ be beneficial to me?\n2) Also, if I wanted to become not necessarily fluent but pretty comfortable with conversation in 2 years, how long should I study each day? \n\nSorry if this was a bit scattered lol \n\nThanks for your time :) ",

Simple kanji I can do ok on but give me something with a lot of strokes and I throw it all over the place. Is this really important to learn the stroke order or can I just get used to writing them and it'll improve?

It can sometimes come across as aggressive or mean, and it is commonly scene in situations such as a highschool bully making fun of some other person \"Nice haircut you got there... Not!\" because it's simple to come up with, and they aren't really interested in being funny but rather are just being mean while maintaining a pretext of just joking around. That said I still feel it is a viable joke format whose simplicity and lack of originality can be offset by a strong delivery, and can be a good format for new language learners.",

        "text": "*Original article* [*here*](https://www.alc.co.jp/jpn/article/faq/03/19.html)*. It's nothing groundbreaking but it's a great short summary for beginners. Also note that in all the examples the actor/topic/grammatical subject are all one and the same, which is why the article makes no distinction even though は is not a 'grammatical' subject marker. Anyway, rough translation below.* \n\nEvery day we use は and が without really thinking about the differences between them. The task to fully explain these differences is a complicated one, even for experts. That being said, the foundational aspects are not difficult. Today, we will look at the most fundamental difference between は and が without going into the finer, trickier details.\n\nThe majority of sentences contain any number of predicate nouns (noun sentence), predicate adjectives (い/な adjective sentence), or predicate verbs (verb sentence). Such sentences could be:\n\n1. Satou-san is a manager. (noun sentence)\n2. Satou-san is nice. (adjective sentence)\n3. Satou-san came. (verb sentence)\n\nSatou-san is the subject in all of these sentences. However, while は is used to mark the subject in the noun/adjective sentences, note that が is used to mark the subject in the verb sentence. In this way, は usually marks the subject in noun/adjective sentences while が marks the subject in verb sentences.\n\nWe can interchange は and が in the previous sentences but in doing this, the meaning of the sentences changes.\n\n1. Satou-san is a manager. (noun sentence; が instead of は)\n2. Satou-san is nice. (adjective sentence; が instead of は)\n3. Satou-san came. (verb sentence; は instead of が)\n\nWhen you attach が to the subject in the noun/adjective sentences, the answers to questions such as ‘Who is the manager?’ and ‘Who is the nice person?’ become ‘No one but Satou-san is the manager and nice’. In other words, in these situations we are excluding other people and placing emphasis on a specific person. On the other hand, attaching は to the subject in the verb sentence also excludes other people by taking on a meaning like ‘The others didn’t come but Satou-san did’.\n\nThe sentences above show just one difference between は and が and there are exceptions depending on when they are used in other situations. For now, a summary is below:\n\n1. In general, use は to mark the subject in noun sentences and adjective sentences and が to mark the subject in verb sentences.\n2. Using が in noun/adjective sentences and は in verb sentences excludes other people and places emphasis on some specific person.",

However my goal now is to be able to understand television news (I'm subscribed to FUJITV live) and NHK news (from the website).

I have a fairly hard time understanding news about politics though and am trying to focus on that for now.   \n\n\nTo get to my real question, to achieve my goal of understanding Japanese news, do you have any suggestions other than going straight into the news and tackling every article and broadcast one-by-one? For example, is there a news vocabulary book or special material used to learn the news? (I think I could improve in all aspects of listening, reading, kanji, and vocabulary.)

        "text": "I have recently just got a addon for anki that tells you the true retention rate and for the past week it's 60.7% and for Past month its 56.1%. I saw online that 80% to 90% is a good retention rate how would I go about fixing this to make it higher.  I am currently at 400 kanjis into the deck.  Is this caused by too little reviews and what settings would I need to change to make an improvement thanks.\n\nThe deck im using is by nihongoshark ",

        "text": "It’s been almost 3 years that I’ve been learning Japanese and I’m at the point that it’s not that I can’t learn the language it’s that I feel I can’t and I’m struggling to just put in the work needed. \n\nI think it’s mostly because I’ve been doing this for so long and feel that I’m not making progress. I go to a small liberal arts school and can only really speak to Japanese people three times a week for 3-4 hours in total, including class. So maybe it’s also the lack of exposure, practice, and reminder of its relevance that’s weighing me down. Many of my peers seem to excel dramatically while I’m still struggling with some key issues like sentence structure (i keep misplacing the subject and particles!).\n\nDoes anyone have advice or share a similar story? How do you keep at it? How did you find your drive? \n\nありがとうございます！",

        "text": "Parser add-on is progressing well.  Currently it allows you to hover over words or grammar and defines them from different sources.  Cards that are black exist in your vocab deck and are reviewed.  Blue means the card is due to be reviewed, and you can click on it to review it there.  (same for both grammar and vocab).  Yellow is the card is suspended.  Red means its not in your deck and you can add it using a local dictionary.  \n\nThe programming for determining the difference between different grammar expressions such as から are built but I'd rather keep working on advancing features instead of hand jamming grammar rules into a word doc.  \n\nLooking for someone that is willing to help with this.  The task is simple enough that pretty much anyone can do it if they have a decent understanding of Japanese grammar.  I'll show you precisely what to do but basically it's just saying things like, if から follows a て then its から2 in the grammar databank.  Naturally if you help, you can have the final version of the add-on when its finished.\n\nWorking on upgrading the dictionary right now to overcome some of the downfalls of Mecab.  \n\nhttps://i.redd.it/mwy4rl16xeo11.png",

        "text": "There's been a good deal of discussion of pitch accent on this sub, which I think is quite interesting. (Largely due to Dogen's excellent resources, I imagine.)\n\nSo share your opinion. \n\nHow important is accent in general in Japanese?\n\nGranted, aiming to sound as close as possible to a native is ideal. But I'm sure we all know English As A Second Language people in our lives and unless they're not even remotely fluent, I think we can all agree it's far from problematic. (Unless you're kind of a dick.)\n\nI've spoken with a lot of Japanese people over the last year about this subject in particular and many of them actually quite enjoy accents, the same way native English speakers like French, Scandinavian accents in English, etc. \n\nMy opinion: As long as people can easily understand you and your grammar is on point, it really doesn't matter as much as some people on this sub seem to think it does, unless your personal goal is to pass as a native on the phone. \n\nThoughts?",

As far as I know it exists in a bubble.\n\nI am already studying with Genki, 80/20 Japanese, Human Japanese, and a few other sources, but I want something that really compels me to practice my reading and writing more often.\n\nAnime and video games are not nearly motivating enough for me to use to delve deep into translation and discussion with others. I like those things a little, but I get more excited about things grounded in reality.\n\nAny tips would be welcome! Specifically, something I can buy Japanese magazines about.\n\nI really enjoy indie and Formula 1 racing, martial arts, and various arts and crafts. Unfortunately I tend to revert to my English alternatives when reading about those things.\n\nI am open to hearing what your interests are even if it doesn't fit my \"Japanese only\" criteria.
