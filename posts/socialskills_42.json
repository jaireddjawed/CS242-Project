        "text": "(I don't know if this is the right subreddit for this, sorry if I get it wrong and for mine nonfluent English...)\n\nSo, I cry very easily and having dealt with a lot of judgement, accusation and constant fighting in my young life I have a lot of trauma triggers, self doubt and a conflict avoidance complex that someone times doesn't even allow me to speak...\n\nBecause of this I think that there are no words that make me fell more shitty than \" if you crying it's because it's true\" or \"because I'm right \", and I hear them a lot. \n\nThe worst case outside my home was once in front of teachers and the scroll director when being scolded for being a \"godless lesbian\" , I started crying when they were talking about senseless things them they said the \"if you crying is because it's true\" and that broke me. The most recent case made me fell so shit that I stopped going to therapy because it came from a psychiatrist, I was going to therapy every week but my therapist told me that I need to ask for an diagnosis from my psychiatrist because she was sure that it could only be a disorder, but when went there the psychiatrist dismissed it all and then, when I asked \"could it be this(what my therapist said)?\" She went off saying that it could be that I was only seeking attention. I'm already terrible uncomfortable when dealing with my mental health and her tone and words made me start crying, then she said the them thing I hate sooooo much.\n\nSo .... I desperately want to know why would someone say that? I'm crying because it the power dinamics, because I'm scared, because I'm hurting, because I can't communicate to defend my self better, not because I did or  am something horrible... Why would you say something that only make some hurt doubt them selves even more?",

        "text": "I (21M) have a lecturer (mid 50sM) who quite clearly hates me. He's also my dissertation supervisor.\n\nI had him for a class last year and thought he did good lectures however he said a few things that rubbed me the wrong way, namely gloating about how he loves to go in and delete any emails sent to him during a strike day. Fair enough not to reply but thought deleting was a bit unnecessary.\n\nI had my first meeting with him as my supervisor in the Fall and it was quite apparent on a 1-on-1 basis that he doesn't like me very much. In the first meeting, he asked a question about my financial situation and how I can afford to live away from parents. This made me very awkward as I don't want to talk about my finances with a professor.\n\nAny time that I met him during the semester for feedback on the dissertation, he'd speak to me in a loud, brash tone, implying that I don't have a clue what I'm doing and that my work is rubbish. He just had an incredible way of making me walk out of any meeting feeling garbage. At this point, I don't feel comfortable meeting him in his office alone any more so haven't went in for feedback yet this semester.\n\nI also have him as the professor for one of my modules this semester. He got the deadlines for an essay mixed up (not surprising given that his office is a cluttered mess) and was gloating about how everyone's participation was terrible and he couldn't wait to give everyone in the class a mark of zero for participation even though basically everyone was contributing. I've just had a tooth extraction surgery so please forgive me for not saying much. He also hasn't bothered to add me to his register, it's as if I don't exist in the class. His intimidating demeanour also puts me off giving points that I want to give, he was dismissive of points I've made in past classes and knocked my confidence.\n\nFWIW, I'm a gay introvert who probably comes across fairly feminine to a guy like him. If I feel like someone is telling me off, I get very tense and awkward. I wonder if it's personal because he's the complete opposite.\n\nRant over. How can I work with this guy for the rest of the semester? I feel like I need to get over feeling uncomfortable so I can bring something to the seminars.",

        "text": "***WARNING. LONG POST. I'M NOT EVEN SURE IF THIS IS THE RIGHT SUB FOR THIS STUFF. IF YOU HAVE TO CRUCIFY ME DO IT GENTLY ❤***\n\nHey there. I (24M) dropped out college 4 years ago due to crippling anxiety and lack of direction. I then got a depressing, dead end graveyard shift job (pun sorta intended) which made it pretty hard to have a life outside of work. Wasn't just the job's fault though. I definitely isolated myself due to the shame I had for my general situation.  About a year ago, I finally sought professional help for my issues. It ended with me quitting my awful factory job, rekindling some of my old friendships, and going back to college to finish what I started. Two of my friends and I were even apartment hunting. I'm on the road to finally moving out if my parents' house. Long overdue, I know. More on that later.\n\nSo yeah. I'm fairly satisfied with my lot, as it stands. Only one problem, though: I'm a total piece of shit.\n\nFor most of my adult life, I've had this horrible habit of completely ghosting the people I call my friends for months at a time. Maybe it's a holdover from my childhood. In school, I would try to win the affection of those who never cared much for me at all. I was seen as an inoffensive goofball at best and a punching bag at worst. Anyway, after becoming aware of that, I would lament over the friends I couldn't have and push away the few I already did. It was so shitty of me. I know that.\n\nAnd all these years later, I realized that I still have this habit of slipping away from the people I'm supposed to love. But it's not out of hatred or contempt. Sometimes it's a fear of intimacy and commitment. Other times it's because I can be sort of moody and I don't want to subject them to my randomish bouts of sadness or frustration. Sometimes it just... kind of happens? And it hurts them, and it hurts me too, just not as much. I don't even bother making new friends anymore because I don't want to put them through that shit. Besides, I gotta focus on keeping the friends I already have. And romance is out of the question.\n\nRemember those two friends I said I was moving in with? Just yesterday I told them I'd rather live on my own. They completely understood and respected my wants, but I could tell one was especially hurt. I knew him since 7th grade. He told me to try to not isolate myself. He's onto me, guys. He knows I'm trying to pull that distancing shit on him again. I want to prove him wrong. I want to make myself care.\n\nTo put sprinkles on the shit sundae, it bugs me (the severity depends on the person doing it) when people abandon me. It's like I'm the only one who can do it. That's some narcissistic shit, isn't it? \n\nThis isn't my \"love language\" or simple introversion. It's a part of me that I need to repair. Or at least repress. I want to have a family, for fuck's sake. And spoiler alert: dudes with attachment issues typically don't make the best fathers. \n\nI've been thinking about just doing more good deeds for friends and strangers alike. We're creatures of habit, so maybe making a conscious effort to be more caring will change me over time. Any ideas? Thanks for reading the ramblings of a madman.",

        "text": "I'm in my mid 20s. I've always been an introvert but over the years, I have become more comfortable in my own skin. I work a very social job which involves constantly talking with patients and colleagues. Yet, outside of work, maintaining a social life and enjoying social activities has been a struggle. \n\nI spent the first few years of my career living hundreds of miles away from home without a support network. My response to that, and to feeling inferior in my career, was to shut myself away and isolate myself. I moved back home afterwards and made real efforts to integrate a social life into my career and joined many Meetups and hobby groups. The people were great but...All I found was the relationships formed were transient. People moved away and disappeared after a few months. It all made forming new connections feel somewhat pointless. I felt after a while like I had nothing new to say. I found this to be the case with many Meetups. Forming acquaintances was easy enough but it was difficult to make anything other than superficial relationships. And that gets tiring. \n\nSo, the last few months, I've again retreated into myself and found myself going to these groups less and less, to the point where it feels pointless to even attempt to do so. It's odd. At work, I feel my social skills and communication are fine. But it's like I exhaust all my mental energy at work, and my social skills outside of work feel really really rusty and awkward. \n\nI do feel socially burnt out and I'm not sure if this will ever go away, but is there a way to navigate this?",

I’m autistic and adhd so I know there’s a reason why I struggle socially but I want to try and improve my social skills at least whilst talking to people.

        "text": "(23M) This has been on my mind heavy. I used to be apart of a dance group with my friends but I left for a lot of reasons. The main reason was that I felt tolerated. They talked behind my back, I got tired of being used for rides, I didn't want to put up a facade for social media like them, and they wanted me to make dance a career like them. I was physically and emotionally drained and too busy working night shift and going to trade school to keep up. Not to mention I was dealing with abuse at home from my narc mother. I left the group and still tried to hang out with them as friends when i could, but i always felt worse after because I could tell i wasn't that respected by everybody.  I eventually just left everybody alone. I ended up joining another dance group of friends I had because I felt they fit me better and respected me. Next thing you know some of the people from the group that I left get an opportunity to go on tour and start throwing shade calling me jealous so I unfriended them on facebook. Then they started to smear me telling people in the dance community and even people in my new group that I was a bad person, unloyal, and a hater and that's why my life is bad. \n\nMy life actually has gotten worse since I cut them off and they say it's my karma for being an unloyal, selfish, narcissist. I missed major important dance opportunities because I was stuck in therapy, my mom ended up lying on me and getting me sent to jail, I lost my apartment and had to move back home, and I lost a lot of friends. Basically the star of the group and he's into self help, being positive, spirituality, etc. but he was the most passive aggressive towards me. He was the main one that got people to go against me People keep saying things like \"How can you hate on somebody who's nothing but positive and shows nothing but love?\" Nobody believes me because he acts super positive all the time online. He even posted something like \"Watch out for people who don't like to be used. I'm a giver and you can use me for anything, etc.\" They've been talking to all of our mutual friends and telling everybody bad stuff about me and about how I'm selfish and unloyal, but I don't go around telling people anything bad about them. Am I going through karma for not being supportive and a good friend or is it a smear campaign?",

I am decent at holding conversations with people, but I always feel there is some sort of an awkward gap between me and the others. I think people also see me as emotionally distant. I notice I am often left out when my friends cuddle, hug or hold hands together. I just want to seem more approachable.\n\nI am almost always awkward, especially when having one to one conversations.  I believe at last part of the reason for this is my tendency to over-analyze social situations and the lack of confidence to approach people that aren't my close friends. I also notice that I rarely try to hug people, especially people that I'm not so close with because the idea of rejection puts too much pressure on me. Almost all hugs I recieve are from other people making the approach to hug me. \n\nThis matter makes me geniunely sad at times. Are there any good practical tips on increasing one's emotional approachability and lessen social awkwardness? Are there any books you would find useful in my situation?\n\nTLDR; I am often socially awkward and feel almost always emotionally left out around people. What should I do?",

I have great coworkers and my bosses are very involved and work along side of us all. \nWe recently hired back an employee that I’m really struggling with.  It started out well, they’ve been so friendly, texting about how similar we are, things we love to do, we have a lot in common… and they even donated a sizable amount of money and support to my family when we struck hard times. But lately… it’s been super difficult. One min things will be great, and then the next Im on the shit list for things out of my control. For example: clients changing their mind on what they wanted just as their appointment starts(which is doable for us), or if I don’t have the exact info they want right when they ask for it, or if a client doesn’t show up. They will lash out at me in front of clients, or completely ignore me when I try talking to them.  I’ll be on the shit list for a few days and then suddenly I’m receiving gifts from them, and getting texts like I’m their best friend. They start asking me to do things for them and while it’s already a part of my job to do these things…they act as it’s a personal favor and I get scared if I don’t do it immediately, it’s going to be another thing. It’s really back and forth and it’s starting to mess with my head. It impacts everyone in the shop too. Work suddenly seems more difficult, stressful and I dread going. I don’t know how the day is going to be from one day to the next. Do any of you have tips, tricks, ideas anything on how I can keep myself mentally stable while working with this person? How can I protect myself from falling victim to the manipulation? I’m great at my job, my crew loves me, and I haven’t had any issues previously. I’ve talked to my bosses and they are aware of what’s going on because it’s happening to them as well but in different ways. I just feel like there’s something I can do to keep myself in control, I just don’t know what or where to start.",

I could socialize with friends and ask teachers questions even speak with them when it didn’t pertain to school! I'm in high school now and I feel like a part of me has died. My socializing skills are horrible to the point where I cannot speak with “friends” . I tend to stay silent when I am in group settings and when in one on one, it is extremely awkward mainly because I don’t know what to say and I kind of feel nervous. I remember being told from a teacher they thought I hated them but this was a result of how I struggle in social interactions (I did not hate them I just struggled with socializing) I’ve been told even I look sad but I don’t mean to be this way. To be frank, I don’t have friends really, and part of being “silent” with some is because I didn’t feel comfortable with them. Now, I just don’t know what to say and sometimes I do feel like they don’t like me and worry if I’m being annoying. I’m mainly being left out in groups mainly because I don’t know what to say. Making friends is very difficult for me. Sometimes if I want to ask a teacher questions, I grow extremely nervous and retreat from asking them. I feel bad especially anyone speaking to me because I feel like my demeanour gets misunderstood even though I mean well and am worried how I can keep the conversation going without being awkward.

What do people do at birthday parties??? I’m in that awkward phase of teenager where all my friends make fun of me for the stuff they’ve just outgrown so I don’t know how to host a party that they’ll enjoy but that I also want to have. I also haven’t been to a party in 3-4 years so I have completely forgotten what teenagers do at parties. Any suggestions?",

I've never been able to approach people out of fear of rejection/being ridiculed, so I never developed any social skills beyond those I use in my professional life. I currently have no friends and have never been in a relationship (aside from a FWB-type deal over 10 years ago). Obviously, I'm WAY behind my peers in the socializing department, and I need to catch up.\n\nRecently I decided to join a Meetup group for people in their 20s and 30s in my area, and this group is hosting a game night (tabletop games, card games, etc) at a local bubble tea shop tonight. After a ton of self-deliberation, I decided I'll be going - I'm not getting any younger, and I feel like if I don't start making friends now, I'll be alone forever.\n\nA couple of questions:\n\n1. What is the best way to properly approach people, ask to join games, etc? I know it sounds obvious to most people, but confidence does not come naturally to me so a little advice on how to do this easily would be greatly appreciated.\n\n2. How do I avoid looking like a socially awkward nincompoop?\n\n3. How do I start/maintain conversations?\n\n4. Is there anything else I should know?\n\nAny help you can provide would be greatly appreciated!",

It's like I try to say the word, but it gets stuck and I can't say it out.\n\nI saw someone describing this stuttering and it is very close to what I experience. \"Would I be correct in believing the stutter you're having is a block? As in you're attempting to push air through but it's stuck, like you're holding your breath?\"\n\nI don't stutter if I'm just reading to myself, or reading something when no ones there etc, it's usually when i have to talk to people where vowel sounding words will get stuck and I cant say it, it also worsens the more nervous I am (etc presenting to a class). I rarely stutter when I speak to my parents or family.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHas anyone else experience this?

Or even things like when they ask you to wait, are you supposed to respond to that?\n\nAnother thing with emails is once you get an email that resolves the issue, are you supposed to email them again just to say thank you? I assume that would be wasting the representatives time because they probably already moved on to another email and replying might reopen the case for no reason. There was one time where I felt bad leaving a rep on facebook hanging after they were so helpful so I said thank you, which caused the chat to assign me a new representative just to look at my thank you message which was pretty embarrassing.\n\nAnyone else confused on the appropriate level of interaction?
