It is seriously a lot better and due to it covering the whole thing in 30 minutes you can follow along a lot more how the flight went south.   \n\n\nFor me the Netflix series kind if messed that up, I couldn't really form an actual time line in my head of the events happening on the plane (displaying actual events on the flight and how it came to be known) by a bunch of misdirected story lines going on for 20-30 minutes at the time just to come to the conclusion; well that's not what happened. When you have that much sidelines presented as factual (by factual I mean displayed as the way it might have happened without indicating that it was actually incorrect) the viewer kind of loses track of what is actually presented as evidence and posable theories.\n\nEdit; Anyone that say they are dropping the show because of the bad reviews, watch Lemmino\u2019s YouTube video about it.\n\nAfter I have finished watching this I went back to watch it again. He shows the timeline of what happened on the plane in a continuous time line, explaining each and every step, how they figured things out.

There were definitely flashes of brilliance, and the animation particularly for the major combat sequences was absolutely stunning.\n\nThat said, I couldn't help but cringe at quite a bit of the dialogue. It felt like a kid in middle school *trying* to be cool and edgy by just swearing for the hell of it. It made sense for Trevor, as that seemed a genuine part of his personality, but for most of the other characters, it felt incredibly forced.\n\nI also felt like the monster designs were kind of a dud, personally. They were just all random, vaguely-humanoid \"shapes\" than actual creatures or demons of any kind. I feel like I would've been more invested by more relatable \"monsters\", like skeletons, werewolves, gargoyles -- no need to reinvent the wheel. And hell, doing some Castlevania staples like Fleamen, or the various \"attractive women with monster parts\", possessed inanimate objects... I feel like there would just be more to latch onto. Maybe even just more \"cultists\" in general?\n\nLike I said, besides that very tail end of the show, I actually enjoyed it well enough. But I think letting the dialogue be more organic, instead of *forcing* so much swearing, and also leaning into more iconic, traditional types of enemies, would go a long ways.\n\nI'm also personally hoping if we get Simon Belmont, they lean more into a more \"warrior\/barbarian\" sort of personality. I was always a huge fan of his original design, where he looks like some crazy buff nordic viking, which would be a far cry from Trevor. Which, I liked Trevor well enough, but definitely ready for a change of pace, personally.","upvote_ratio":0.4,"created_utc":1678753317.0},{"title":"[Curious] Netflix's In The Name of God: A Holy Betrayal- Is Jeong \/ Jung Myeong Seok \uc815\uba85\uc11d a common name in Korea?","author":"PitifulRun3933","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/netflix\/comments\/11q71f9\/curious_netflixs_in_the_name_of_god_a_holy\/","text":"First time poster here and not Korean\/unable to read or speak Korean.

Articles about the cult leader\/scum Jung Myeong Seok was buried in pages 2, 3, 4 where most people hardly ever access. Even on reddit, searching for posts on Jung Myeong Seok \/ JMS yields more content on the drama EAW than the cult leader and his \"church\".\n\nAfter multiple searches, I found articles detailing how pervasive JMS followers are, with many in places of influence (e.g. KBS producer, translator etc).\n\nBased on the Korean spelling that I found online, both JMS (cult) and JMS (Attorney Woo) have the same spelling \uc815\uba85\uc11d.\n\nHence, I was wondering if Jeong \/ Jung Myeong Seok is a common name in Korea and this is purely a coincidence or could it be an attempt of closet JMS followers in the entertainment industry trying to conceal his name in western website searches?\n\nAnd am I overthinking or is JMS (cult) not super known in Korea?

(SPOILER WARNING)","author":"MactoTillDeath","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/netflix\/comments\/11oiylv\/outlast_survival_show_was_hard_to_watch_thanks_to\/","text":"This show was a rollercoaster of a watch. It started out like a normal survival type game show. Who can outlast who? Simple, right? But then we see the true colors of Amber, Jill and Justin, and holy shit was it hard to watch sometimes just because of how they acted.\n\nThey singlehandedly forced 4 decent, moral people out of the competition by resorting to, basically, bullying. After they interrupted the merger of Bravo and Delta teams with their childish, petty, deceitful, cheating, and evil behavior I almost wanted to stop watching. It was nice to see Justin get his in the end, but my stomach was churning the entire time Amber and Jill started acting like victims and hypocrites, accusing their own teammate of \"cheating\" after he sabotaged them like they sabotaged others. It was disgusting behavior to watch unfold. \n\nUltimately, I had to finish the show while simultaneously hoping those horrible women wouldn't win and **THANKFULLY** they didn't! Yay!\n\nHonestly, I didn't want anyone from the last 2 teams to win. Not after one of the guys from Charlie betrayed his former team and especially not after they didn't give Javier a chance. I thought Javier deserved to win the most out of all of them. He could have survived all on his own of the show would have allowed it. And when Charlie team lost the chick that was on their team due to some colon blockage or whatever, then he would have fit in perfectly. Ultimately, he just wanted his rightful vengeance against Alpha team and even said he would leave if they wanted him to once they knew those bitches would be defeated. It just felt like a kick in the face that they didn't give him a chance. They acted like they were \"too worried\" about Alpha retaliating and sabotaging them like they did everyone else, but how COULD they when it would be 5 against 3? They could have had 2 people guarding their camp at all times while 1 hunts, 1 fishes, 1 forages, etc.\n\nWhatever. It was an annoying show with horrible contestants. I'm soooo glad that Amber and Jill didn't win though. And I honestly wish NOTHING but the worst for them. If those two actually remain close friends after the show (like they claim), then I feel bad for ANY person that ever has to cross paths with them. Jill is conniving and selfish, and Amber is just horrible in every way imaginable. She even LOOKS like an evil bitch. Like she would melt if she got caught in the rain.\n\nAnd they both are pretty ignorant too lol. I mean, in episode 7 Jill was writing that note to Charlie team and she literally said \"he stold our stuff.\" Lol. \"stold.\" Nice 4th grade education you got there. Enjoy the rest of your life acting like a victim, being sexist, being a deceitful liar, theif, and overall dishonorable person.","upvote_ratio":0.93,"created_utc":1678537616.0},{"title":"How is You not listed as a comedy?","author":"Fishtank-Brain","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/netflix\/comments\/11pqpke\/how_is_you_not_listed_as_a_comedy\/","text":"I wasn\u2019t really inclined to watch it because i thought it was a thriller about a creepy stalker obsessed with a girl. but three episodes in i haven\u2019t laughed so hard in a while. not only is joe pathetic and incompetent but there couldn\u2019t be a less interesting person than beck. lmfao how could anyone be obsessed with her?

Meanwhile those who actually know the ins and outs of the MRSAT start debunking key points of his theory, the key ones being\n\n1. They have NEVER used the MRSAT data to track the location of an airplane before. This was the first instance of this occurring, which is pretty evident in how long it took to collate and translate the data.   \nWith this in mind.. why would these supposed Russians go to all this effort to turn of a machine that is inconsequential to them with minimal tracking capabilities. \n\n2. This machine stayed on for a further 6hrs after the main comms cut out, which speaks for itself. \n\n3. You categorically cannot control the flight of an airplane from the communications area in question, so again, whats the point?\n\nThe smugness of this dude touting his theories and using it to get attention, only for this to be given more attention with him as a key narrator for most of the series, spreading false information and conspiracy theories. \n\nThis whole series is purely speculation by people who are more interested in fame and notoriety or at the very leas want to be 'the one' to figure it all out.\n\nThe reality is whatever occurred is a mystery to the general public and we may never know the truth. \n\nWhilst I don't have an issue with forming theories and ideas, especially surrounding such a strange and mysterious incident, it's only natural to want to form answers to gain some level of understanding. My issue lies in the sensationalism and platforming of these theories touting by specific bad actors and pulling the families back in to experience the grief all over again. \n\n3\/10 wouldn't recommend.","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1678280687.0},{"title":"Accidently bougth code in wrong currency","author":"ulrich_rudenz","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/netflix\/comments\/11n3g2x\/accidently_bougth_code_in_wrong_currency\/","text":"As the title says, I bought a Netflix Code accidently from Amazon US instead of Amazon EU.

I spend an hour locking down a profile to be age restricted and title restricted then realized that the child could just create a new profile on the profile selection screen, watch any title, R rated, NC-17 rated, etc AND because of their horrible UI (see item 1), they can simply delete the profile when done.\n3. The account holder doesn't get an email when a new profile has been added or deleted thus allowing item 2 to happen over and over again without any email notifications.\n\nI reported all anomalies to support.

And I feel like I NEED to vent about this one. This will be full of spoilers, you've been warned.\n\nLet me just say that I don't think every aspect of the show is bad. Performances, I think, are good. Dialog is acceptable. The core concept (at least, one side of it) is interesting. It's just that the plot is downright painful. It's like the writers just wrote in random contrivances to progress the plot, and did this multiple times every episode. I didn't even make it to the end, but by the time I stopped watching, I'd just roll my eyes whenever some new development happened instead of being shocked.\n\nIt starts with an interesting premise. Stanley Tucci is a former crim. professor and currently convicted murderer on death row somewhere in the American southwest. He solves crimes that the police otherwise don't touch or are unable to. Sure, cool. David Tennant is a vicar (priest I guess?) in England. Not sure how that factors in, but OK I like Tennant. Whatever.\n\nThis story has two sides - the Tucci side and the Tennant side. The Tucci side is fantastic. Good premise, fun dialog, interesting characters. The Tennant side is where, in my opinion, the story falls apart. It's just one random contrivance after another to back Tennant into a corner where he's left with \"no choice\" but to take the actions he does. Let me explain.\n\nThe first big confrontation that, I think, makes little sense is after the Tennant gets home from a day at his church. That day, he was handed a flash drive containing porn by one of his attendees. A clearly troubled, most likely mentally unwell boy. But he agrees to take the flash drive for safe keeping from the boy's puritanical mother, and not recommend the boy seek other forms of help. Because church, I guess? Anyway, he leaves the drive on a shelf in the entryway, where by coincidence his son grabs it to load some learning modules on from his math tutor. I think he hands the drive off to the tutor? The story's already getting a little hard to believe, but it's still within the realm of possibility.\n\nThe math tutor, Janice, quickly realizes what kind of porn is on the drive while she's moving files. The illegal kind. She calls Tennant over to the computer and confronts him about it, and Tennant starts to explain that it's not his. She jumps to the conclusion that it must be his son's, and he tries to deny it   \n and tells her it's a member of his church but can't say who it belong to. I assume because he made a promise before God and takes it VERY seriously. You know, more seriously than pedophilia. Good ol' Church!\n\nSo this is where things get even less believable. See, they try to circumvent the weirdness by having a prior scene where Janice is shown to be a bit of a weirdo loner who has a hero complex. She doesn't believe the Vicar at all, and acts very cagey. He repeatedly asks if she's going to tell the police as soon as she leaves, and she does a very bad job lying about it. Ultimately they get physical as she's trying to leave, and Tennant winds up pushing her down into his basement and locks the door behind her. The idea is that, in parallel with this, Tucci is telling the audience how it doesn't take much for a normal person to become a murderer. Tennant's story is supposed to be one such example, unbelievable as it is. \n\nMy problem with this whole scene is that normal people don't act like that. I think most reasonable individuals would try and have a calm, rational discussion with someone who is clearly very trusted within the community, and claiming you're mistaken. Especially when the evidence is circumstantial at best. It just so happens that SHE is one of a handful of people on the fucking planet who'd act really awkward about it and immediately try and bolt to tell the police the version of the truth they're SURE must be true. Instead of, ya know, talking about it.\n\nObviously Tennant's character is also in the wrong for not just coming out and saying who the drive belongs to, but he's the Vicar of course. It's just another contrivance in the long list of contrivances to make this whole story possible.\n\nAs you can imagine, things keep spiraling out of control from there. The next big contrivance to move the plot along is that the boy who actually owns the porn, Edgar, suddenly has a 180 and vehemently denies ever owning it. Tennant tries to secretly record a conversation of him confessing to the ownership, but he has this big dramatic scene where he can't even say it in front of God. Further driving the Vicar into a corner and giving him \"no way out\". Also side note: did he not expect Tennant to see what was on the drive? I feel like people who deal in that stuff are way, way more careful. Then again, he's deeply mentally unwell and shown to be suicidal. How convenient! Gotta keep that plot rolling somehow! Also, is getting him to confess without him knowing somehow not breaking your vow? Seems very loophole-y to me. \n\nSo now you've got a story with one woman who's probably on the spectrum and a boy with deep mental health issues, all coalescing around this deeply devout man of god who feels honor-bound to keep this boy's privacy...but only sometimes. By coincidence. And even then, the obvious solution is to just go the police at this point. If the boy is careless enough to hand unencrypted drives to people, he's probably got a digital paper trail on his home computer. Tenant's character apparently never even considers this possibility. There are just so, so many other obvious ways to resolve the situation that any normal person would think of. But he doesn't....to move the plot along.\n\nI could keep going (and believe me, there are more), but I've already written enough. I made it the end of episode 3 as more and more of these contrivances stacked up to make the story \"work\" that it just became comical and unfun to watch.\n\nI'm just curious if anyone else who's seen this one disagrees, or what they thought of it.","upvote_ratio":0.75,"created_utc":1677742341.0},{"title":"Harlan Coben has teamed up with Netflix for another thriller series","author":"Geeki_dude","url":"https:\/\/www.stylist.co.uk\/entertainment\/tv\/fool-me-once-netflix\/763545","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.88,"created_utc":1677692346.0},{"title":"can't watch downloaded shows on my phone","author":"FemTheHutt","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/netflix\/comments\/11fzzpa\/cant_watch_downloaded_shows_on_my_phone\/","text":"Help!

Then episode 19 the show changed drastically became a lot more positive vibes, no conflicts,  and in the start of season 3 seems like wrestling isn't even an important aspect of the show anymore.  \n\nI know shows can change season to season to stay fresh or try to but when you instantly dislike every single change idk how to continue \n\nIdk they took a perfect show imo and ruined it.  Slowed the pacing took away all the struggle.  All these feel good moments.. Marc Maron was great as a surly bitter guy they turned him into a big softee trying to win over Ruth.

They want to subvert what you thought the story would be and actually make it about a deeper message of some kind, or have it more complicated in an attempt to make it more interesting. This worked for How to train your dragon, and it's excellent because of it. But I feel it really didn't work for sea beast and the biggest reason why I think that is because of the story they planned to subvert.\n\nThe opening scene of sea beast was really well done and the introduction of the kid character was actually handled pretty well. It was set up to be a story about legacy and the story we must carve out for ourselves, all while hunting a mythical beast that had driven the old captain to crazed obsession.

I know everyone wants to rock the world and show a whole new way to tell old stories but that's not necessarily needed.

I\u2019m very interested in clinical psychopaths and sociopaths, and would like to see them in the lead (their pov maybe), not just being chased around. By clinical I mean real representation of them, not all killers are psycho\/socio, and not all of them kill. \n\nI would really love a show with multiple seasons, the more the better but more than 2 preferably. I\u2019m looking to be drawn in to something I want to binge. I would settle for an exceptional movie. \n\nExamples of what I\u2019m looking for are characters with no remorse, guilt, regret, nothing surprises or bothers them, their reactions to violence, death, intimidation are not normal reactions. Extra point if they have genius level intelligence. \n\n-I liked the Santa Clarita Diet for many reasons but the family wasn\u2019t phased by killing and eating people.    \n-I loved the movie The Hunt because the lead actress was so nonchalant about the whole ordeal (till the end which was very real representation of someone with trauma).    \n-The lead in the movie The Guest was great. Funny, deceptive, dangerous, charming. \nI do like shows like Mindhunters, Dahmer, It\u2019s The End of the F*cling World, so good but too short.\n\nEdit: oh yeah, I loved Killing Eve.\n\n**Edit #2: I just saw the movie Thoroughbreds. These are exactly the type of characters I\u2019m looking for, especially Olivia Cooke\u2019s character (Amanda). True psychopathy that needs to observe people to learn to fake human. I loved this!**\n\nEdit #3: Just saw the first episode of \u201cYou\u201d. I found it to be unbearable. They tried to make a rom-com about a stalker.

It was available on Netflix Canada for a while but it\u2019s not anymore. I\u2019m not sure if it is an American movie or maybe British or something, since I watched it with the French traduction at the time. There are no big actors in the movie (unless I just really don\u2019t know them) so they mostly look like usual not so popular actors. \n\nThe story takes places in a medium-wealthy suburb, probably in the USA but I can\u2019t say that for sure. The film follows the story of a group of friends in their twenties or thirties, mostly couples I think, doing a house party with food and alcohol. At the beginning everything is going well (so the viewer can get to know the place and the characters a bit) but after some moments strange things begin to happen. We don\u2019t really follow one specific character or couple, so the movie is mostly about the situation. At some moment, one of the character (a man) goes to the bathroom, and when he comes back to the others, things have slightly changed. Some people act a bit differently, are more tensed, but not because they are drunk or high. They are just different. The guy finds this strange but it\u2019s not enough for him to panic. Then the same things start happening, but to other characters. One time, someone goes outside for smoking or taking a walk maybe (I\u2019m not sure). When he comes back, things have changed for him too. But it\u2019s not something he can possibly discuss with the first men, because it\u2019s just a personal experience for both of them. When it happens, everyone around them has changed. And it will also be like that all to all the other characters who will go trough this. I don\u2019t remember the other exemples of people leaving, but I know that each time one of them comes back, the situation gets weirder. One time, for exemple, someone comes back and one of his friend is drunk and violent, but he was not like that at all before (he was not even a drinker I think). So many things like that happens, and at the end of the movie (SPOILER ALERT NOW) we (the audience) find out that the street where the house is on is a suburban street where every house is exactly the same. But what is happening is that In every house there is the same group of friends, but slightly different from each others (like clones). So, every time someone gets too far away from the group (like they go to the bathroom) they switch to another house without knowing it, like another \u00ab\u00a0reality\u00a0\u00bb where things are slightly different. At the very last scene, we see the street from sky view, and there is a huge UFO on top of the houses. We, the viewers, then understand that this situation is caused by aliens intervention. However, the characters don\u2019t know about this, and probably think they are going crazy because everyone of their friends are changing around them.\n\nIve been looking for this movie for a very long time, ever since I realized that It was not on Netflix and that I couldn\u2019t find it anywhere. I searched for it on Google several times with a lot of descriptions, and even asked chatgpt today with the exact same details, but he was not able to find it. I recently talked about this movie with my sister, with whom I watched it and she also remembered it vividly but doesn\u2019t know the name (of course). At least I know It was not a dream! But maybe my sister and I switched in a dimension where this movie has never existed? I\u2019m really starting to believe I\u2019m crazy, but I know I watched this movie, on Netflix, a few years ago, between 2017 and 2019. If anyone has any informations or clues I would be so happy! Thank you everyone for taking the time to read this! \n\nTL,DR : searching for the name of a 2010\u2019s sci-fi suspense movie I watched with my sister about a group of friends having a party and weird things happens and they switch houses with like clones of themselves and it\u2019s because of aliens","upvote_ratio":0.7,"created_utc":1676347645.0},{"title":"Various Error Messages on Smart TV\u2019s","author":"justaguyin2019","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/netflix\/comments\/111rm8n\/various_error_messages_on_smart_tvs\/","text":"For the past week I haven\u2019t been able to access Netflix on my Samsung Smart TV or my Amazon Fire TV.
