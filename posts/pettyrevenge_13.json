Fast forward 2017 and we started talking and she wanted something serious, but I explained to her that I don’t want a long distance relationship, so it ended there and never spoke again. \n\nWhen I went to visit my home country, I happened to stay a couple of days in her city, so I texted her to let her know I was in town. She was in disbelief, so she invites me to her home, and I went there the same night.\n\nWe sit in the apartment park, started talking about our childhood memories, what have we been up to, and other random stuff.\n\nShe mentioned me that she had a boyfriend and were getting married soon, and that she was getting a bunch plastic surgeries next month, all paid by her boyfriend.\n\nI told her I wanted to exchange my dollars, so she offered to take me to  a currency exchange, but they were all closed, so we went back to her apartment.\n\nWhen I decided to leave, she told me the doorman shouldn’t allow visitors at this time of the night because of covid, so she told me we should bribe him. And asked me to pay him 5$.\n\nI only had 20s and 100s on me, so she offered to take a bill up to her home, and come back with the exchanged currency.\n\nI gave her a 20$ bill and there she went.\n\nI waited for 10 minutes, until I got impatient and started calling her. She didn’t respond, so I went to the doorman and asked him if it was true that guests weren’t allowed at this time, and he told me no, so I told him how she scammed me.\n\nThen she comes out the balcony and told me: those 20$ are not going to make you go bankrupt, nor will they get me rich.\n\nI was fuming on my way home… not because of the money, but because I got played.\n\nI screenshot our conversation where she invited me over, and some old horny texts she used to send me, and photoshopped the dates so they looked recent. I searched her whole instagram followers and found her boyfriend. Right on time before she blocked me.\n\nI send the dude the screenshots, and told him I was having sex with his girlfriend, but I felt too bad for making someone cheat, and decided to make the right thing.\n\nHe went to the apartment to check if I was really there, and there I was. Good thing he didn’t check the whole thing, otherwise I would’ve been busted\n\nHe breaks up with her, and she calls me insulting the living shit out of me for lying. I acted as if we did have sex just to make her angrier, and in case she was recording for proof.\n\nHe asked me if I was the one who gave her 20$. She took him out for ice cream with my money lol.",

        "text": "Background info: New roomie (M25), invited to live with the boyfriend (M25) and I (F25) in our 4 bedroom home, because he needed a place to live cheaper than his situation, we wanted to save on monies, we had extra space. NBD UNTIL I noticed he's frickin' WEIRD around my two dogs (M2 &amp; F2 - both rescues)\n\nFirst weird thing, I'm home alone with roomie eating dinner together and he casually asks if the towels in his (guest) bathroom were ever used on the dogs. I said no those are humans only, the dog towels are the ratty colorful ones in the garage. I figured they were stinky or something. Instead he says, oh no, I'm allergic to dogs and when I used that towel, I broke out in hives on my body. I naturally freaked and asked to check out the hives (there were none to be seen), if he had an epi-pen (no), if he needed to go to the ER (no). He kinda was just very casual about it and was like, nah it's chill, maybe the dogs laid on it because I leave it on the bathroom floor. Insert bewildered face from me here. I've never had someone be allergic to something and so casual about a brief encounter....Thought it was weird but he seemed totally ok so I left the topic alone until the BF came home from work. We're in our bedroom laying in bed talking and I bring up this situation, mostly asking the BF if he knew in their 20 years of friendship that the roomie was allergic to dogs and why on earth would he agree to live with us when I have 2! The BF is just ask bewildered as I am, apparently the roomie grew up with 2 dogs at home and a few years ago a roommate of his had a dog too. We decided to drop the topic because the roomie was so *casual* about this allergy.\n\nNext, I notice that sometimes the roomie will attempt to jump scare my female dog. She's a rescue and came from an abusive situation so she's fairly jumpy and skiddish. The roomie likes to hide behind walls and jump/yell at my girl scaring her and just... *cackle* so evilly... this just seems so *mean.* He will also occasionally chase her like they chase you at haunted houses. So she's like frickin' RUNNING for her life because he scares her. I talked to him about it and he's like, yeah I'll stop it's just hilarious sorry. Except...I don't think he has stopped. Only stopped doing it when I'm home. Sometimes I'll come home and she will be cowering in the bedroom looking frickin' traumatized. Note- he doesn't do this jump scare to my boy dog. In fact he tends to be sweeter and tell him how pretty he is.\n\nThird, this is what really got me and spurred my reason for petty revenge. The roomie will grab my girl dog's face and hold it between his legs, so his butt is centered over her face and **FART** on her face. I saw it happen once, but based on her reaction when he was grabbing her face, I'd assume he's done this before. I was LIVID. I flipped out and yelled at him for doing that. Who the hell farts on a dog's face?!?!?! He basically told me I was over-reacting and it's normal for humans to fart and he wanted to direct it into her face because he thinks her skiddish behavior is hilarious. The boyfriend wasn't home yet so I left with my dogs to go to the dog park to cool off and get her away from him. The BF comes home and I informed him of what happened and how I felt like the roomie didn't care for my feelings, brought up everything else stated above too, and the BF goes to have a chat with his friend. The chat was fruitless. The roomie said sorry, but prolly didn't mean it. I really think he still does this shit when the BF and I are at work. \n\nSo. Finally. **Petty revenge time**. I came home and my girl was acting strange again, she was scared, cowering and kept whimpering under the bed. I figure the roomie did something while we were at work, so when he left for his next shift I went to the backyard. Picked up every single shit that was still out there from the dogs, each in their own individual bags, had 8 piles of bagged shit. AND HID THEM ALL OVER THE ROOMIE'S ROOM. I'm talking hard to reach corners, under furniture, in the closet. This dude wants to claim a dog allergy, harass my girl dog, fart in her damn face and think he can get away with doing it when I'm not home? **Not gonna happen.** \n\nHe hasn't said anything yet, but damn his room smells.",

        "text": "Hello! Everyone who knows me knows I’m someone who loves to write medieval fantasy Royal stories. \n\nThis story starts way back 5 years before, In freshman year with a former friend. I’ll call her Sheila, Sheila is a typical rich girl who believes she can get whatever she wants at the snap of her fingers. I however, had to work for everything I got, it be clothes or electronics. \n\nIn our English language arts class, there was a writing competition, and the winner got 500$ and a chance to get their story published. \n\nI of course set out working right away, it was a few chapters and around 10,000 words. I love writing in third person because you don’t have to think about it much. So I was able to write it up in about a week. \n\nThe story revolved around a large royal family set in a different universe on a continent called Manaria. Basically they were all fighting each other for the throne and were trying to wipe each other out. (The book began with a branch of the family being slaughtered by the kings guard) that type of stuff. \n\nWell the assignment took three weeks, so I had it looked over around twenty times by four different teachers and read by around thirty classmates. They all loved it and gave some constructive criticism. \n\nWhen Sheila asked to join me for the project I obliged because I was a pushover and already finished. So I added her to the Google doc. \n\nFlash forward the day to the submission, I was locked out of the Google doc, but was still able to read it. So much about my story was changed, it was now some flimsy story about royal elf’s battling for an elf throne. But much of my writing still remained. \n\nI tried telling the teacher but they didn’t believe me. The girl had read over the story around fifty times so she knew all the facts I knew. \n\nShe submitted it and won the contest. I received a 0 on the assignment. However she never got it published because she was too lazy to send it in. \n\nFlash forward to last week, I wanted revenge, Sheila always wanted to change her last name to something more sophisticated. Valgarian. It kinda fits because it sounds like Vulgarian, but hey it’s still a nice sounding name. \n\nI wrote a three thousand word first chapter and put it all over my social media. In my book the Valgarians are a ancient royal family set in a medieval universe called Rathnara; however the current king has declared war on his two cousin lines because they conspired to kill his children. (He had went mad before but this was because he was being poisoned, and wiped out his distant cousins family and had planned to wipe out the others) I got so much positive feedback I decided to continue on writing it, I’m around 10,000 words now but lo and behold I got a email and text message from Sheila bashing me from taking her idea. \n\nI played dumb of course, asking her what idea? What name? And then she admitted to stealing my story back freshman year and how she was childish but she would really like me to change the name. \n\nI however, will he keeping the name, I have already created their family crest, family tree, etc. I have a plan to get published and I will probably be finished with it in 6 months. \n\nTLDR; a classmate stole my book idea. I steal her planned last name",

We slept in. (Also, sorry for any mistakes, and ... Need ... caffeine...)\n\nAfter the baby and furbaby rush hour settled down, something made me check the monitor by the front door. On the camera, I could see the Bucket Woman approaching the bin from across the road on the other side, away from the eyes. She looked like she was trying to appear casual, but because she is on crutches, she actually looked more like Matron Dorothy Conniving-Bitch trying to sneak up on someone. *Sneak sneak sneak*. (If you don't get the reference, Google \"Let the Blood Run Free\". It's an anarchic Australian comedy from the early 1990's. Consider yourselves warned.)\n\nIt may be the lack of caffeine in my system making me cranky, but I jammed my finger on the intercom and said loudly: \"LEAVE THE BIN ALONE\". \n\nI hope she didn't hurt her foot again.",

I also saw this post on tiktok as well so a lot of people are from there wanting updates too!\n\nSo I cooled off before texting her and took out the whole “paid for it” part because I feel like the truth is already damaging enough. To answer the comments about him finishing in me and lying about having a condom on being sexual assault so I looked into it. It’s only considered sexual assault in California and we’re not in California. Hopefully that law will change for victims in the future but unfortunately there’s nothing I can do. \n\nWhen I sent the text it never delivered because it turns out he had gone on to his mom’s phone and he blocked my number. Then he drove to my house and started spam calling me to go outside so we could “talk” and he could give me my stuff. I agreed (I wanted my stuff) and when I got there he begged to talk to me and explain himself so I agreed. I wanted to hear his lame excuses. He starts BEGGING me for a second chance. The man was hyperventilating and crying. Blowing snot into his shirt. Tried to “hold my hand to calm down.” Having a full on panic attack while I just sat there trying to hold back laughter. I think he noticed because he kept saying how his “pain isn’t funny.” I told him what ISN’T funny is having sex with random strangers unprotected because he put my health at risk. He proceeded to tell me that “they were all virgins” because he liked virgins and “knew they were clean.” I asked him if they bled on him and he shrugged and said “Some of them did. Big deal”. Does he not know that virgins can still have AIDS??? So I had to sit there and explain to this GROWN man that virgins can still have AIDs. Well turns out he didn’t know. Apparently his Christian school didn’t have a BAISC HEALTH CLASS. Then he told me he’d do anything to have me back and even said he’d get an epilepsy ribbon tattoo for me because I’m epileptic. What the fuck..? So I was like “okay you’re fucking insane.” Then went back inside. \n\nA week and half later I was at the gym running on a treadmill when I got a notification. I looked down and low and behold, it’s his mother. To be quite honest, I was nervous because I didn’t know how she’d take the news. The text read this:\n\nHi OP, when I found out you two had broken up I went to text you and noticed he blocked your number on my phone. He was very ashamed of himself like he should be. His father and I are both very hurt to hear he has done this to you. He came clean to us just now and I’m very disappointed in him. Just know our family still cares about you. I also want you to know that he keeps saying how he got tested back in September and that he is clean. \n\nThe relief I felt when she was on my side. As for everyone asking if I got tested for STDs I did a urine test and I came back clean for everything but I’m contemplating getting a Pap smear as well. \n\nHe still bothers me and shows up to my college “just doing his homework in our study area because at his college there isn’t a good one.” Which is bizarre because we go to different colleges. He used to go my college to get his pre requisites but he doesn’t anymore. I’m too busy/tired to even complain but I just think it’s weird. Idk if I should call it a happy ending or not but thanks for the support everyone y’all are dope.",

        "text": "So I was a single mom several years back, living in a trailer with an unfenced yard (yeah, I know). My new neighbors moved in with their (grand?) daughter in the unit next door. The nasty mother (or grandmother, I had no idea how old this woman was) told the girl that she had free reign of both yards, which was normally fine, because my daughters would occasionally play with her. She wasn't a nice child though; bratty, mouthy, and none too smart, so my girls generally stayed away from her.\n\nOne evening in the summer, when the temperature was getting low, I decided to tackle spraying the stubborn wasp nests that were around my trailer. I waited until I knew most people had headed inside for the night. Not the neighbor girl, though. She was outside, sitting in the middle of my lawn with a friend.\n\nI tried to warn them, \"I need you two to move to your lawn to play; I'm spraying for wasps tonight.\" Mouthy little princess replies, \"My momma says I can be out here if I want to.\" And then sticks her tongue out at me for just good measure.\n\nI gave one more warning, \"Okay, I'm still spraying my property so you do what you want, I guess!\" I then proceeded to douse the first nest in poison. The nest fell off the awning and wasps started pouring out, aggressive as hell. I smiled just a little tiny bit when I rounded the corner to the back and heard little screams of terror as the girls ran into the house. Surprisingly, the girl never played in my yard again.\n\n(Just to add for anyone that may get upset - neither girl was stung, just frightened by them. Also, I won't apologize for spraying wasp nests on my house. The ones in this area are aggressive and do not help pollinate.)",

        "text": "So I live in a townhouse where each unit has one designated parking spot. These are pre-chosen for each of the homes, so you can't park in a different spot unless you were to move houses. \n\nIn these spaces there's very little room for each car to park. You need to park very carefully and directly in between your lines in order to fit in and not move into a neighboring space. If there's one ***hole parker, the whole line will be messed up and the last person on the line likely won't even have a spot to park. \n\nNow my neighbor (RN) drives a SUV, nothing too big, but apparently big enough that he can't seem to park it in his lines. Ever. Frankly it's just the fact that he straight up pulls in and doesn't bother to readjust his parking. No matter how crooked or out of his space it may be. I have watched this. \n\nI've put notes on the car politely asking him to stay within his lines, but he still parks the same way. It was not too big of an issue until my neighbor (LN) with the spot to my left bought themselves a car. This meaning that me being forced to park out of my spot puts them out of a spot, too. \n\nOnce I received a note on MY car from LN telling me not to park in their spot, that was the last straw. \n\nRN always drives into his spot, meaning that his driver's door is on my passenger side. My car is honestly a 23 year old junker that's been through a significant amount of road torture over the years. If it gets a scratch/dent/etc, it would not be noticeable to me at all is what I'm saying. \n\nSo what I've started doing is expertly parking AS CLOSE AS POSSIBLE to his doors. I'm talking about 2mm of room between my side mirror and his vehicle. I am a fairly skilled driver and am able to make that parking job with a couple corrections. I have been taking my time to do this every single day I see him over my lines.\n\nYesterday I walked outside with my dog and I saw him crawling across his passenger seat to the drivers side. Mission accomplished.",

My own fault I had so much anxiety that I couldn’t bring myself to go half the time. It was 20 years ago I was 18 and an untreated nut job.\n\nSo partly because I thought it would help me make new friends, admittedly immaturely. I had a stuffed naked mole rat from a certain Disney show that I put in the water bottle pouch of my messenger bag.\n\nOn the first day of class this girl who was about my age was sitting next to me and quietly mocking me to a friend. She mocked my weight, my beard, and especially the stuffed animal. She didn’t stop the whole first class and made me feel awful.\n\nThe first few weeks of class were easy because it covered only things I had already covered in psych class in high school. So I did really well and she saw me get 100% on the first test. But then the class got a lot harder and I was having trouble keeping up. \n\nThen I noticed the girl who had been mocking me copying my assignments and tests. Even though I knew I was doing really poorly. During the midterm which I was sure I was going to fail I slyly made sure to move my arm so she had a better view of my test.\n\nWhen the test came back the next week I got a low D and she got an F(probably because there was a short essay that she couldn’t copy and she did worse on that than me).\n\nShe approached me after class that day and said something like “What the hell I thought you were smart?!” I wish I had said something funny or cleaver but I just responded “yeah sorry I’m not” and walked out.\n\nShe dropped the class that week so she could take an incomplete instead of fail.",

Shortly after, her engine blew up and she needed a new car. \n\nShe went to a small local car \"dealership\" that was in someone's front yard and bought a \"gently used\" Buick. 1 week later the engine blew up in it and they refused to do anything about it and oh well the warranty was voided because of xyz. My uncle called them and they said \"not every purchase is a winner, its luck of the draw\". \n\nThis of course made him upset but there was some truth to it. About a month later, granny calls him and tells him that once again this has happened except this time to her bingo friend Mildred. Mildred had heard about her going there and thought it was good not realizing the issue granny had (bingo was every 3 weeks).\n\nThis is now 2 old ladies that he knows of that have been sold defective cars that eat the dust right after buying. \n\nHe learns that Sandra  is wanting to trade her car in and he gets an idea. He asks Sandra if he can buy it and she go get another car. She says deal so he goes and gets the title transferred and a bill of sale. He goes to that guy with the 2 faulty cars and asks to sell his car as he is strapped for cash. Being the shark that he is he lowered to price a good bit and my uncle lost $400. However, the car guy did not know that my uncle had clogged the radiator full of that stuff to clog leaks cause there was a small slow leak, did an oil change but apparently did not put in enough, same with the transmission. \n\nWhen the guy asked he told the truth. I did a fluid flush and there was a small leak but I fixed it. Next day the guy is calling and said that that this car was ruined and had no fluids at all. My uncle laughed and said well you should know not every purchase us a winner, its luck of the draw. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I say this man owned a dealership, I mean he had 10 cars in his driveway with for sale signs and all he did was basically buy junk cars and flip them to unsuspecting people like old ladies.",

        "text": "Girl spreads lies about my boyfriend, gets reminded that her life sucks.\n\nSo this story needs to start from the beginning. Before I (21 F)ever met my boyfriend (22M), let’s call him Bobby, I had a pretty close friend group. In this friend group it was a mix of girls and guys. Well one of the guys started hooking up with this girl (22 F named Miley) off Tinder so she starts to show up in our friend group. She was vapid and really hard to hold a convo with so me and the rest of the girls in this group didn’t really like her. We didn’t dislike her, but we had no reason to be around her except our friend. A few weeks after she starts coming around I meet Bobby and we start dating. From there I found out that he is friends with Miley, no biggie, he can be friends with girls. Well Miley decided to start telling Bobby’s friends that he wants to fuck her, that is an absolute no so he confronts her and tells her to stop telling people that and then completely blocks her from everything, you would think that would be the end of it, but no.\nBobby and I are at a friends party when Miley shows up, we don’t speak to her and decide that we are gonna leave after we finish the conversation we were having. Well Miley decided that right then and there she wants to start an altercation. Lots of yelling and her calling me insecure and fat so I went to leave. Bitch grabs my arm so she gets a face full of my vodka cran. Cue the waterworks and her screaming that I’m crazy and attacked her. Bobby and I leave and deal with the repercussions later. The people at the party take our side and she was never seen again.\nHowever, a year later she decided to text my boyfriend from a fake Google voice number. This is showing you the crazy. But her messages are her wanting to apologize to me and him. Seemed kinda genuine but I was the messaging her from his phone (important later) and I wanted to see what her true intentions were. I think she just wanted peace because we all had mutual friends and we would never be totally rid of her. I agreed to get some drinks and she apologized to my face, and I told her it was me she was messaging (mostly so she doesn’t think that she and my boyfriend were doing anything without my knowledge). All is well, her and I arnt really friends, but we see each other more frequently because of our mutual friends. \nThat was about a year ago, and a month ago she has a complete meltdown and crosses one of her best friends, let’s call her Sarah. Sarah then comes to me and tells me that Miley and Bobby had made out in the past and provides screenshots of her saying that. I confronted Bobby and he tells me that it never happened and she’s lying. I have complete trust in my partner and I know that he won’t lie to me especially about something like this. I mean if u met this girl or saw what she looked like, it would be so embarrassing to have people think that you would get with a guy who ever hooked up with her. \nSo I come up with my plan. Miley has a long distance boyfriend that she cheats on frequently, however we arnt too sure of that validity of their relationship. It seems very one sided as he will not messages her for a week and she will complain to whoever is listening about it. I decide to message this boyfriend and tell him about her adventures with frat boys, as well as everything she has told people about their relationship. He was not very happy. I then inform her old workplace that she breaks in and steals things from them(did I mention she’s on parole? Have fun with that when they finish their investigation bitch) Finally I craft the message to end all messages. When I tell u this message was peer reviewed by my friends and her friends and that this message deserves to go into the any hall of fame, I am not lying. It just was perfect. \nThis crazy bitch sent me the most sad response anyone could send. I mean you had all the time in the world to respond to a text and you chose a message about my boyfriend spending his money on me? At least give it a better thought. After she sent her one weak response I blocked her. Apparently that wasn’t good enough for her and she first sends the screenshots of this message to my boyfriends friend? I don’t understand the reasoning behind this. She then sends it to my boyfriend (I had him unblock her to see what she would say) as if he would say something about a message that he checked for any grammatical errors. Delusional psycho. He blocks her. I wake up to messages from her that she sent me from a fake number!!! When I tell you this bitch is crazy. She sent me the screenshots of her messages between her and “my boyfriend” (remember it was me she was messaging) so I block her again on this fake number. She then has one of her friends send me the messages again. Well I have a date stamped message to my best friend explaining the situation and multiple screenshots about what I was texting her posing as my boyfriend. If anything that’s the most embarrassing thing out of all of this. She tried to get her friends to say that I’m the problem for tricking her when she was texting my boyfriend from a fake phone number. I mean being delusional must be contagious. It’s been crickets ever since but I still get the screenshots of the group chat and just to see her sad and depressed and drinking ever night to sleep is probably what made every second of pretending to be her friend worth it. \n\nI hope she doesn’t see this cuz she will probably go even more crazy and start making new fake phone numbers, but if she does, I got one thing to say to u, im truly sorry for sending you that message, animal abuse is not something I take lightly and it’s not good to beat a dog especially while they are already down. I hope you can find some sliver of happiness in your sad existence while online strangers feel bad that you have to wake up every morning and live with yourself. The saddest part of all this is that you lack the depth and emotional intelligence to understand that everything I said is true and you will continue to live that degrading life because you will not change. From the bottom of my heart I hope you will take this opportunity to fix yourself.",

We weren't prepared for how expensive it was so we discovered that £800 didn't go very far in 5 days. On the second day we walked into a restaurant just down the road from the hotel. Now you have to picture two British people both wearing leather bike jackets, ripped jeans and tattoos. We were seated and the waiter was an arse, talking down to us and acting all superior. We ordered two pints of Brooklyn Harbour beer, one fish and chips and two ice creams. Because my wife  didn't order a main course he brought an extra plate and knife and fork. He said \"I thought you'd like to divvy it up between you\" . Then flounce off. When the bill came he said \"that's not too much is it?\" $49.90. I gave him my biggest smile and gave him a fifty and told him to keep the change. As funny as I found that the next day was even better. When we went to a really good value for money deli. As we go to sit down with our food this twat of a waiter is sitting eating. I sat at the next table, leaned over to him and whispered \"you might work in there but you can't afford to eat in there can you, you fucking twat\"",

They ofcourse freeloaded off of me and wanted me to send my report to copy. I had to comply because all teammates needed to have the same copy. It was frustrating.\n\nNow, fast forward to the 8th semester, everything is now offline, still my teammates didn't want to do a thing and freeload off of me. I decided it was enough and I needed to do something.\n\nThis semester, we had to work on the same project but do some more research yada yada. \nThey didn't even turn up to any meetings the teacher kept for discussing the projects and how to do it.\n\nI did everything as usual, but this time, I took the introduction part to explain. Remember, this time the presentation would be offline and that means no more hiding behind the camera with video off stuff.\n\nI made the necessary changes for my slides but didn't really double check their slides for the presentation. (I did the presentation and the report all by myself while coordinating with sir, so there were mistakes that I couldn't see)\n\n D-Day arrives. They didn't even print out their report until the last moment and blamed it on me how I should've printed it out for them. I just rolled my eyes.\n\nI started with the presentation, answered the questions of the external examiner and came back to my seat.\n\nThis is where the fun part begins.\n\nTeam member A went next, the image of the truck I put in had 16 wheels and the one we worked on has 10 wheels and he was asked about that. Had no clue, got roasted.\n\nTeam member B was asked what torque is, as I put the SI unit wrong and was dumbfounded. \n\nTeam member C was asked about everything wrong in the presentation, dude started saying all the references I put and the teachers were laughing amongst themselves.\n\nAt the end the examiner could guess I was the one who made the presentation and I agreed. \n\nI'm happy I got my revenge. They deserved it as they contributed nothing.\n\nTo summarise : I had the best day and still laugh about it when I narate this story to my friends.",

        "text": "So I had been with this girl for 6 months. Since the very beginning I did not trust her. She would always tell me about other guys but insist they were just friends. So eventually she wanted me to create an instagram for her. So I was happy to do it and said yes! I told her that it would be connected to my instagram and that I would be receiving all her notifications. Sure enough after a few days, I looked at the messages that were being sent and I saw her hitting up other guys. So I deleted her instagram that i created for her and was pissed but never broke up with her. 2 months after this, one of the guys who she insisted was just a friend and had no interest in her, was actually her other boyfriend and I found out because she wanted to put it on her Facebook. So after this I broke up with her. We continued to talk and I forgave her. Another 2 months later she tells me that she made out with her ex husband and I was so pissed at this point. The next morning she said she was lying and was just scared. I said mean things after i thought she had cheated on me again, but we continued to talk. After awhile i realized i could not be with her and broke up with her. The next day she decided to have her pussy eaten by a female. This was completely out of character I thought for her, but it was probably my own ignorance. So after some more fights she said I was never her boyfriend and that I was completely single. I knew she was saying this to be manipulative and make me beg for her so I did and strung her along until i went on vacation to Colombia. She had been fooling around behind my back and broke my heart, so now it was my turn. I made sure to call her and reassure her that she was the only one I wanted. Which she loved to hear. The next morning, I met up with a girl I had been talking with on tinder and we had unbelievable sex. Toe curling, make me not want to move type sex. So we made sure to take pictures and I sent them to the girl who had cheated and broke my heart. When I say I have never gotten so many phone calls (over 50. I blocked her number but she found a way around it by adding  00 or something to her number) begging me to talk to her and over 200 text messages over 3 days, I can't stress that enough. She never wanted to talk on the phone or text much before this and now she was telling me how much she was crying and her heart was broken and how she can't sleep and how much she loved me. I knew that feeling because I had been there so many nights with her lies and infidelity. I put up with so much of her shit, it was my turn to make her feel how I did for so many days and nights. I feel like I took a piece of myself back. Being cheated on is the worst feeling there is in a relationship. But getting petty revenge and seeing phone call, after phone call, after text message come in, was priceless. I had done what I seeked out to do. Get petty revenge on a cheater. I did it for myself and for all the people who have given their hearts and been treated like dirt and have been cheated on. Absolutely no regrets and i can move forward with my life, with a big smile on my face.",

        "text": "This happened 20+ years ago. My senior year government teacher hated me and my two best friends for some unknown reason. We weren’t the popular kids (band geeks), is the only reason I can think. If the popular kids laughed and talked about the party last night, she said nothing. If we whispered to each other on a project (that we were allowed to work together on), we’d get yelled at. \n\nSo I started taking her word. To a T. My seat was the very first left seat in the room. It was a large class so I was maybe 2 feet from the board. She liked to walk around the room when she taught too. So I would turn in my seat to follow her and pay attention. “Turn around! Face the front!” She’d yell. So I’d turn around and face the front. “Why aren’t you listening to me? You have to look at me to listen!” So I’d turn in my seat to look at her. “Turn around! Face the front!” Wash, rinse, repeat multiple times. Finally she kicked me out of class. Principal asks why I got kicked out? I followed directions. I got sent back to class. More of the same ensued for the rest of the school year. \n\nFinal day of classes comes around. She pulls me aside and says “I have good news and bad news. You failed your final but I gave you a D in the class. I don’t ever want to see you again.” I still got to graduate!\n\nLater in the summer, right before the next year started but kids knew their class, I was at the school visiting a teacher (that I did like). I made sure to stop by that classroom of the above teacher. She was less then thrilled to see me and rudely asked “What do YOU want?” Without a beat I said “Just wanted to let you know, my little brother is in your class this year. And oh, by the way, he’s got a different last and if you think I’m horrible….” I let the statement fade and I evilly laughed and walked away. \n\nSure it wasn’t my actual brother (hence the different last name) but another friend’s brother who was a walking nightmare.",

        "text": "Met my nextdoor neighbor the day we moved in to rental house. It's a nice neighborhood, so I can only imagine having a rental property isn't popular. I figured that going in and planned to go out of our way to be good, responsible, and quiet neighbors, and to make friends if we could. We complimented their freshly laid sod, which was being put in by landscapers while we chatted. It was clearly a big deal to him by how he talked about his yard.\n\nTwo days later I accidentally rolled onto the edge of his grass while trying to back out and return our moving truck. It bunched up a piece of sod, but did virtually no damage. Didn't even create a divot in the dirt. Before I was even out of the truck he screamed something and slammed the door behind him. \n\nI knocked until he answered, admitted the error, and offered to pay the landscaping bill to have it repaired, even though simply pushing the sod back into place and adding some water would have made it good as new. He said he would send me the bill and shut the door in my face.\n\nNo bill, because surprise there was no damage, but nonetheless he started treating us like we ran over his grandmother. Not only does he refuse to talk to us, he'll even go as far as turning 180 so to not face in our direction if we drive by. Ridiculous.\n\nNow honestly, he's putting in way more effort to avoid us than we even care about his approval in the first place. So really, jokes on him to begin with. But it's about the principle of the thing... Queue petty revenge.\n\nWhen we first met, he had said Halloween was a big deal in our neighborhood. I bought king-sized candy bars just in the chance he'd be told or hear how great our house was for having them.\n\nI made Christmas gifts for 3 neighbors on both sides (and these guys to be polite) and delivered them to introduce ourselves. Then, we've had every one of our other neighbors over for dinner. It's a very close neighborhood, so when they inevitably talk about us, it'll always be brought up how we had them over. Just a matter of time before he'll have to explain why.\n\nI also befriended his wife and now we go on dog walks together every week. Since I had a group chat to give them both my number when we moved in, I use it to coordinate when we're meeting. \n\nHe may not have anything to do with us directly, but I'll be damned if it's not going to be as difficult as possible for him. I've got big plans for a neighborhood BBQ this summer. That should really be a riot.\n\nTl;dr My new neighbor is a baby and trying to avoid us so I'm making friends with everyone to annoy him.",

Every last one. She jumped up to turn her paper in, and I quickly changed all my answers before turning mine in.\n\nWhen the scores came back she had a zero and I had a perfect score. She was so mad she put her head down and cried, and I was all sing-song fake kindness: “Oh no, what’s wrong? Didn’t you do well on the test?

One Sunday we were there for a leisurely lunch with a couple close work friends when a co-worker from another department at our company came in with his wife, their kids and a few of the kids' friends. There must have been at least half a dozen kids that were all about age 10-12. Every time a new pan of crab legs came out the kids would run up and take all of them before anyone else could get there, sometimes even cutting in front of people. This happened at least 3 or 4 times until other diners started complaining and the workers told them they needed to stop the kids from doing that. The parents basically ignored the workers and the kids kept going back. Eventually they all left and we talked about how bad the kids were probably going to feel after eating that much crab and butter.\n\nThe next day I overheard the co-worker talking about how his kids and their friends were missing school because they all got really sick later that night and they had no idea why (duh). Nice petty revenge win for the crab legs!",

I mean like the kind of dumb that gets angry when they don't know something. He misspelled his own nickname on a tattoo and tried to tell people it was on purpose. Yes, I was rebounding hard.\n\nWe met through a mutual friend who should have warned me about his anger issues to be fair but she didn't. She only ever played MTG with the dude. So I talk to him for about a week on the phone for hours a day. Even help him through a small panic attack which is easy for me.\n\nHe invited me to a BBQ in town that weekend. Everything went so well that I went back to his place and spent the night. Cuddling only, all clothes on. This is important.\n\nNext day he just whips his dick out like no warning. And here's where I as the presumed dick-handler, should have received a warning. Dude had a micropenis. I mean rock hard it was a third thumb down there. This was my second time running into this though with men and obviously its not something they can control so it's not like I said anything. I flinched though. It was surprise. I'm sorry. From that moment on he never forgave me. Didn't matter what I did. No matter how I tried to please or pleasure him. I was an asshole because I flinched. Even when he would yell about it I would never say anything about the size. I just said a version of the truth, seeing his dick for the first time surprised me because he didn't tell me he was whipping it out.\n\nWell only two weeks of this go by and finally he wants to try and have actual sex, which I admit, I had avoided. I'm fat, and I already have my own insecurities about my body and this was a new person. But we had done damn near everything else so, we tried.\n\nGuy couldn't get past my thighs. Starts yelling about how my thighs are too big to fuck me. Somehow I stay a few more days and don't leave until this fool manages to tear/pop the muscle off my right forearm bone from not letting me go.\n\nI leave yelling at him that basic fucking math said he knew how big my thighs were when we met but I didn't know how big his dick was, only he knew the value of X, that shit was an unknown variable to me. \n\nLater when my mother, yes my own mother, found out ab8my arm, I also mentioned what caused the argument. I had to stop her from being violent towards him because she was furious. \n\nHowever I did not stop her Plan B which was to go to Spencer's Gifts in the mall, buy these stupid freaking baby sized condoms, and mail them to him anonymously with no return address. Which she did. \n\nI never heard from him again.",

        "text": "&amp;#x200B;\n\n**“The supreme** ***art of war*** **is to subdue the enemy without fighting.” - Sun Tzu.**\n\nA while back, when I was in high school, my school was having a wave of teacher layoffs (don't ask me why, nobody knew). Well, my science teacher left and another one came in, let's call her Alexandra. i'm going to be honest, she seemed cool at first, but looks can be deceiving.\n\nOk let's get straight to the point. She passed a huge book for us to read and summarize it. She would grade it for dedication/effort/writing/the full summary itself. I was inspired, and I'll be honest, I don't think I've ever worked so hard on a resume/school assignment before ( It was worth half my semester grade if I'm not mistaken)\n\nAnyway, I handed her the summary. Passed one week and the day came for her to hand them back. I could hear all my classmates screaming happiness with A+ grades when they got their work back. I was excited. Then I hear my name being called by her, but it was... different than expected.\n\n\"chris, can we talk privately?\"\n\n????????, that was my reaction. Anyway, we leave the room, and I get the bad news that I got a D. I was shocked. Never in my life had I received a grade like that. My heart was pumping a mile a minute. \"Teacher, but what is wrong about my essay? \"\n\n'your writing is trash. If you can't write well, then go back to elementary school.\"\n\n'K, i got you.\"\n\nI'll be honest, I wanted to punch her. I was pretty sure my resume wasn't shit like she said. And calling my writing trash? wtf?. But I decided to keep my composure, apologize, and leave the place.\n\nOn the way back home I had the idea to take my old science teacher to check the work and see if it was bad like Alexandra said, and guess what? He said it was spotless, and it was a straight-A job. Now I was pissed. if i didn't do anything about it, ther people would suffer because of her to.\n\nI told everything to my father ( since i don't have authority over school, etc ), who was also pissed.\n\nHe scheduled a meeting with the school to discuss the issue. They got together in a room, including Alexandra, to talk about it, and how the teacher was totally irresponsible in grading my work. I could hear the screams in the room. Basically, Alexandra was trying to defend herself from the accusations, saying that what she did was completely fair regarding my essay.\n\n\"And what about calling my son's writing trash? What do you have to say about it?\"- My dad asked her\"\n\nAs expected, she was out of words in there. School dudes ( director, staff in general ), were trying to calm down the situation, but there was no escape for her.\n\nApproximately 1 hour has passed, and all I can see is Alexandra leaving the room with a hateful look at me. Guess what happened? she was fired shortly after the meeting ended due to incompetence at work.\n\nIn this case, revenge was very, very welcome and tasty, and i don't regret abbout ANYTHING.\n\nEdit: no, i wasn't allowed to enter the room, but they were speaking loud. I couldn't hear most of it, but my dad told me the details later.\n\nIf anyone is wondering, yes, i posted this on prorevenge before, but felt it wasn't appropriate to the server's topic and decided to post in here.\n\nAnd sorry for any writing mistake, i'm not american, and not that fluent in english lmao.",

What that meant for the week was I had to basically singlehandedly put on a 3 day event where people could buy and sell used ski and snowboard equipment with the team getting a percentage cut of all sales. A ski swap, if you will.\n\nSetting up this event took all week, and while I had a lot of help basically everything funneled through me. \nIt was exhausting but a lot of kids paid their team fees from fundraising events like this.\n\nThe night before the event I got home at about midnight. I had worked all day about 16 hours and when I got to my bed I could not wait to fall asleep for about 4 hours before opening day when I had to be at the top of my game to sell as much equipment as possible to benefit the team.\n\nMy upstairs neighbors who I really did not know were incessantly pounding into the floor. \nI knew they had a few young kids and this had happened one time before, so I tapped on the ceiling with a Broom stick. \nThey were not phased by this, which was a little confusing as it worked before. Nothing major just a hey, trying to sleep here. \nYou couldn't really hear then walking or anything regularly and a little noise is to be expected, but this was not that. \n\nI am a young guy and typically stay up pretty late so it's never really been an issue if they are kind of loud. \nBut this sounded like a 200lb man jumping off the counter type of banging. \n\nI tried to sleep, even put in earplugs but this was shaking the building. \nAfter I had enough and it was about 130am(on a Wednesday btw) I grabbed a big long wooden ski and pounded the ceiling 3 or 4 times.\nWithout skipping a beat, they pounded back! And then continued whatever activity they were doing that quite literally had art on my wall noticeably vibrating. I did it again, and they returned with a BANG BANG BANG onto their floor, my ceiling. \n\nMy roommate at the time worked nights, so I was home alone. I had a decent stereo system in the closet so I hooked it all up and turned on an 8 hour Excision Playlist at full volume with the speakers pointing towards the ceiling, one of them on top of my kitchen cabinets. \nIf you don't know what Excision is, think grinding metal dubstep sounds. It's kind of disorienting for someone who doesn't regularly listen to that kind of stuff. \n\nAt that point I knew I only had a couple hours to sleep if at all anyway so I left. \nWent to a friend's house and crashed for a few minutes and then went to work.\nThe speakers blared at full volume until about 7am when my roommate got home. \n\nI didn't really want to be that petty but it was so rude that late at night to pound back into the floor that I had enough. \n\nNever again did we have any issues with the noise.",

When I did I saw what company he worked for \n\nI kept him behind me \n\nOnce we got into the city he started driving normally.\n\nHe followed me right into his yard.\n\nI waited for him to get out of his truck. When he did he started yelling at me .\n\nI just handed my dashcam to my neighbor, Steve whose name was on the door if the cab.\n\nYeah, he was fired immediately and walked off the lot.",

        "text": "So for a quick bit of background info, I got super into astrology, crystal collecting, tarot cards, runestones, paganism, modern witchcraft, vulture culture, etc when I was about 19. At 21, a close friend, we'll call her Marcy, also started expressing interest in the occult, so I started sharing my knowledge/supplies with her. Anyway. \n\nSo around that same time, Marcy had a crush on this absolute slimey douchebag of a guy. She asked for my help to get him to like her (not that she needed it. She's drop dead gorgeous, has a perfect body, amazing fashion sense, super interesting personality, etc) so as much as I hated being the third wheel, I said sure. I'd come along and help hype her up and make her seem that much more amazing. \n\nLittle did I know, her entire plan to make herself look good was to make me look bad. Apparently, the guy thought witches were super hot and wanted to \"get with\" one, so Marcy used this as her in. \n\nShe starts rattling off everything I  had taught her, but with a holier-than-thou air about her. She pulls out *my* tarot deck that I had lendt her so she could read his cards, making sure to throw a quick \"maybe one day you can get your own deck too\" my way. So the whole date goes on like this. Shes passing my own knowledge and crystals and cards off as her own, all while claiming I know nothing and that shes taught me everything she knows. The real kicker was when she invented a coven she was the priestess of, and claimed I was a \"hopeful initiate\" but that she had to confer with her deities as she wasnt sure I'd make the cut. \n\nI was livid. At no point had I agreed to let myself be belittled and demeaned and insulted just so she could spend the night with some idiot womanizing tool. But I held my tongue through the evening. I let her look good. I let him be impressed by her \"vast knowledge of the occult\"\n\nAnd I planned my revenge. \n\nThis was over winter break in my junior year of college, so I was used to working like a maniac on projects, but I had nothing else to occupy me. \n\nI spent the next week and a half writing my own personal grimoire. I used one of those artisan made journals with the thick, rough-edged paper that feels like its hand-made. I drew star charts, palm charts, astrolgical signs, crystals and their alignments, deities and their powers/areas of jurisdictions, I mapped out the pagan calendar and detailed each of the holidays and what they were celebrating, I wrote spells, I wrote curses,...i just went crazy. So when Marcy asked me to hang out with her and douchebag again, i was *ready* \n\nHe took us to some sleazy bar and bought us drinks. At some point I made up an excuse to get up, at which point I \"accidentally\" knocked over my purse and **whoops*** my grimoire accidentally fell out of my bag and into his lap. \n\nHe flipped through the book and was immediately hooked. For the rest of the evening he only had eyes for me. Only had questions for me. Only bought drinks for me. My friend was so mad. But what could I do? It was only an accident that my grimoire had fallen into his lap! Hehehehe. She kept trying to get his attention back but it was all in vain. \n\nHe left the bar with me that night. I brought him back to my place, watched an episode of The Vampire Diaries, and sent him on his way. \n\nIt was never about the guy to me. I just loathed being used as the butt of the joke: the antithesis of the picture of \"desirable\"   \n\nI think, to some extent, Marcy understood. She never asked me to be her third wheel again.",

I have lived here a year longer than the roommate that is \"on to me\" and wants to catch me in the act of trying to get over on my og roommates. \n\nhe's very suspicious of me and thinks I'm trying to get over on my other roommates. \n\nHe's \"caught\" me a few times, like once i was doing my laundry in the laundry room and watched him sneak up on me trying to \"catch\" me doing something nefarious. He didn't know i could see him sneaking up on me in a reflection.\n\nLike when i go downstairs i can audibly hear him turn down his phone so he can listen to me in the next room. I'll hear his phone playing whatever but as i come out of my room and down the stairs i hear the volume go down. So he'll sit in the living room and very intently listen to me in the kitchen, hoping to \"catch\" me doing something. Catch me eating what i am not supposed to be eating, or taking something that isn't mine. \n\nso last night i walked in to the kitchen poured myself a glass of water and then as silently as i could just stood there drinking my water in silence for like 10 minutes as i watched the microwave clock trying to not make a sound letting the tension build because i know he is on the other side of the wall and cant see me. I know he's going nuts trying to figure out what I'm doing that he can't see or my reason for standing in the dark in the kitchen drinking water like a goddamn psycho. \n\nI know its petty but I get a thrill from expecting him to come around the corner expecting me to be doing something to get caught for, but i'm just fucking smiling at him drinking water.",

Instead of changing my password and signing out of all devices, I just kept pausing the song every once in a while. Pausing escalated to relentless skipping, then I started playing classics for him such as “Never Gonna Give You Up”, “Deepthroat”, and “Sh-Boom” over and over again. He would change the song, I would change it back. I then discovered I could control his volume from my end and made sure he was hearing everything loud and clear. Every time I catch him listening I do something of this sort until he gives up and closes Spotify. It started with me doing this about 5 times a day and it’s dwindled down to about once per day, each time he gives up quicker and quicker. I listen to music quite a lot so it’s easy to catch him.\n\nWhenever I want to listen to my music I just click forget device and then I’m free to play music on my end. Other than the few times he’s started playing music while I’m listening he’s barely an inconvenience. Eventually I’ll change my password, but part of me wants to keep doing this until he gives up entirely on my account.",

        "text": "Hi first time poster, and this happened yesterday. I (30 something male, never will reveal my age lol) had a hard day at work and just left the gym with my roommate. As most of you know going to the gym usually makes you hungry as heck, so I was already slightly cranky. We live in a apartment building in the city on a major street. Our building has two driveways: one in and one out. The clickers to open the garage will only open the in doors, and theirs a button to open the out doors inside the garage. So as we  are about pull up to the turn to get to the driveway we see a huge black Suv blocking everything. Seeing this I was definitely ticked because I hungry and tired. Since I didn't know who's car that was I called my landlord and see if anyone had a car like that in the building. However the landlord told me the person was chased off earlier for blocking the driveway. The landlord tried to have him towed but technically since he was on public streets the towing companies wouldn't touch it (still wondering why but whatever).They called the police earlier but the person disappeared before the police got there. So I ask if I could call the non emergency number to get the police to tow it away. He said be my guest. So I'm halfway through dialing the number when it clicked that they said this was the second time today that this guy has done this. That's when I think the hanger become petty. I backed up my car and parked it 3 inches from the guys driver side and put my hazards on. Then called the police  and waited. I knew the person wouldn't be able to move his car at all because his passenger side door was being blocked by a tree. We waited about 45 minutes for the police to show up. They asked me if I called the police island I replied yes. They asked me why I was parked so close and I explain the above. The cops burst out laughing and asked me to move up and bit so they could get the information. 10 minutes later they came back to my car and said I was free to go and a tow truck would be there in 20 minutes (slow day aparently). Aparently this guys plates didn't match the vehicle, and the plates were expired. So that's 3 tickets and a tow. I pulled into the garage and smirked as I cooked tacos watching his suv get pulled away. Best tacos ever 😋",

Our kids are happy and dont see our personal struggles.\n\nIm never left with enough money at the end of each week because im the default parent for 4 children (2 step sons). Whenever he gets an idea that i have  cash saved... something comes up and i need to pay an extra bill. The last 5 months ive just been working on me. Ive been working out again and now sent emails back and forth to a surgeons office for a mommy makeover\n\n10 years of this and I set up a cashapp (he doesnt know about) to crowd fund a mommy makeover. Whenever i brought up a goal for a mommy makeover he laughed... then would make \"joking\" comments where hed call me a whore or hoe out of no where. \n\nPETTY REVENGE CASHAPP!",
