[{"title":"What does \"Personalized Off My Chest Style Post\" mean?","author":"TimPowerGamer","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TrueOffMyChest\/comments\/m501ud\/what_does_personalized_off_my_chest_style_post\/","text":"People have been telling me that their posts I've been removing actually shouldn't be removed because they are \"personalized\" and meet the \"off my chest\" criterion.  I'm going to explain this is greater detail with plenty of examples so what type of posts are allowed is more clear for everyone to understand.\n\nPersonalized in this case means that what you're posting has to be directly related to you (this would include a close person, such as a family member).  And it can't be something that's impacting a large number of people unless it has a specific application to you.\n\n**Examples of valid \"personal\" posts:**\n\n\"I just found out I owe a bunch of money on my taxes!\"\n\n\"My parents just found out they owe a bunch in back taxes and might go under!  I wish I could help them!\"\n\n\n**Examples of \"impersonal\" posts:**\n\n\"Taxation is theft!\"\n\n\"Don't you hate it when you have to pay taxes?\"\n\n\n**What is meant by being an \"off my chest\" style post?**\n\nAn off my chest style post is you getting something off your chest that's personal in nature (so, both related to you or someone you know quite personally and has a direct impact on you or them that isn't generalized) AND that is a story, situation, hope for the future, or some other type of direct situation.\n\n**Note:  Opinions, hot takes, asking generalized questions not tied to a valid post, political commentary, talking about things that have nothing to do with you SPECIFICALLY, generalizations, etc. do NOT count as off my chest style posts.**\n\n\n**Example of valid off my chest style posting:**\n\n\"I stubbed my toe and cried today.  I feel so humiliated.\"\n\n\"My friend is transitioning and it feels like they're becoming a different person, but I want to support them.  It just feels like I'm losing them.\"\n\n\"I lost my job due to [insert cancel culture thing here].\"\n\n\"My parents hit my kids and I don't want them to ever see or touch them again!\"\n\n\n**Examples of invalid off my chest style posts:**\n\n\"Stubbing toes is the worst thing ever.  Does anyone else agree?\"\n\n\"Transitioning fundamentally alters a person to the point where they aren't even themselves anymore.\"\n\n\"Cancel culture is bullshit!\"\n\n\"Children should not be hit!\"\n\n\"As an (insert group here), I feel that (insert opinion here).\"\n\n\"I like X TV show.\"\n\n\"Does anyone know how to fix a broken headlight?\" (we've gotten these before, lol)\n\n\"Not ALL men\/women...\"\n\n\"[Insert any commentary on any hot-button topic here.]\"\n\n**Note:  You can give your opinion on a personalized situation, but your whole post can't just be the opinion, and it has to be something that's meaningfully specific.  But you cannot stand on a soapbox and preach it.**\n\n\nIn some cases, a post may be removed that can be reworded to \"fit\", but the majority of the time there isn't a way to reword a post to \"fit\".\n\nI am quite aware that this kills a large portion of what the sub used to allow, but after seeing the types of post that are now front-paging that simply weren't allowed to before due to all the flaming and getting the same hot takes over and over again, I honestly can't help but feel like this was a net positive.\n\nAlso, my removal of your post for not following the rules has nothing to do with whether or not I personally agree or disagree with the post.  I've removed something from every major category recently.  I'm also pretty good about explaining how posts don't fit the criteria if asked on any given specific.  This absolutely sucks for me.  I've removed over 500 posts in the last 4 days.  I hate this, but the benefit to the subreddit is substantial, so I'm going to keep this going as much as I can.\n\nAlso, if a post is up that violates these rules, 99\/100 times it's because I'm sleeping.  I may also make a mistake or another mod might approve a post that was removed by the automod and not my manual flagging.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1615744332.0},{"title":"I saved someone from being SA\u2019d.

He has the voice of the gods. It really is a gift and he uses it for good.\n\nHe gets ppl to stop filming in the gym by calling them out publicly and loudly. \n\nHe usually says \"Hey bud, there's no filming here\" or for women he's says \"hey sister\"\n\nSince his voice is very loud and booming, it immediately fills the whole room and everyone turns around to see the A-hole who's filming.\n\nThis is actually pretty genius because calling people out publicly forces them to comply since everyone is now aware and looking at them. They don't get the opportunity to play victim or create their own narrative since everyone is already apart of the conversation.\n\nI remember seeing a video of a guy confronting this girl privately about filming at the gym, and the moment she realized that she was being called out, she immediately ran away and played victim, which could have put the guy in danger.\n\nI'm so thankful for the guy with the voice at my gym. Sometimes when he's really angry he'll continue to rant very loudly about how everyone isn't comfortable with their bodies being on the Internet. And there's a no filming rule for a reason.\n\nI owe that guy a Christmas card.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1678642602.0},{"title":"My mom abandoned me for her husband when I was 16 and he just got murdered 4 days after my 21st birthday","author":"webbie143","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TrueOffMyChest\/comments\/11pvsoi\/my_mom_abandoned_me_for_her_husband_when_i_was_16\/","text":"Life\u2019s crazy and karmas real.

I had gone on a small vacation to another country for 10 days. I have a cat. She is the most adorable, loving cat ever. I have had her since 5 yrs. She is honestly a HUGE part of my life and it devastates me to think that one day we'll be separated. So I am planning on going on this trip and ask my mom if she'll mind looking after it for a few day. She says it's no problem and I go on my trip come back yada yada. The day I came back after dropping off my things at my house and freshening up I go to my parents house to pick up my cat. Mum opens the door starts asking how the trip was and I am talking to her but do not see my cat anywhere. When I ask her she says my cousin had come and asked to have it till I come back. I panick cuz my cat does not do well in new environments (she was well acquainted with my parents house). I go to their house and my cousin opens the door. I ask her where my cat is and she casually say the attic. Mind you the attic has a window and that's it. I ask if she put it then and she says that no it has been living there. The way she was casually was mentioning all this I WAS SEEING RED I SWEAR I WANTED TO STRANGLE HER THEN AND THERE. I go up to the attic panicking and there she was. She was so scared that she jumped onto me at this point I'm about to flip out. She did keep food and water and litter box. I admit I lost my temper. She knew about my cat. She knew it was scared in new places. She HERSELF asked my mum for it. \n\nI hate her. I hate her. I wish hell on her. The attic was dark at night. My cat is still acting scared. My hearts breaking seeing her behavior. All this as a revenge for me having an allergic reaction at her wedding. I'm going No contact.

And yet he still continues to show up to family functions (birthdays, family dinners), even though I have moved on with another boyfriend. We are now expecting a baby. I just don't understand why his scrawny clown looking ass just won't fucking get the message. I have moved on with my life but he is this irritating thorn in my side that I can't dig out. \n\nAnd the worst part is my family is still just happy to see him. Like oh yeah just come inside, it's not like it will be super awkward when my family member, your ex, shows up with her partner. Nice to see ya, just get comfortable. \n\nI have no issue with my siblings seeing him outside of my life. I understand we were together for a long time. But it has gotten to the point where I didn't even go to my sister's birthday celebration yesterday because I just knew he was going to be there. And guess what?! I checked Facebook this morning and my mom has posted pictures of them all with him. \n\nI had already decided to distance myself from my brother because his head is way up my ex's ass. This morning, I have decided to distance myself from all of them. I can't deal with this while I'm pregnant. \n\nI'm just so tired. I left him, but it seems I never really had the choice to leave. I'm just stuck, forever with no choice other than to leave everyone else behind for my own mental well-being.\n\nSince you and your friends like to watch what I post on my accounts and stalk me online, i know you'll see this: Hi Derek, and fuck you.\n\nUpdate: I am only 8 weeks pregnant, the baby was not planned but we are going to do everything we can to raise this baby right. My partners family is a wonderful support system so we are not alone.\n\nU2: I want to emphasize the fact that I am not trying to say they cannot see him. Just do it on their own time in their own space. Go to his house, go to a bar, go fucking fishing for all I care. But no not enter shared spaces where I have to deal with the awkwardness and the stares from across the room and look at his face after everything he has put me through. By no means am I perfect. It was not a good relationship. We both did unpleasant things. I just want to move on and not be reminded every time I see my family that I will never be rid of him. I know he will be a part of their lives, I couldn't stop that if I tried. I just don't want it shoved in my face.

I'm 18F almost 19 and my nephew is 3. His mum is my cousin.\n\nI have a really bad touch aversion issue(OCD). It's always been like this but I tried to fight it for years. I would hug my friends, hi-fives etc. And I thought that that repulsion inside me would go down but it kept getting worse.

My nephew is *very* affectionate. He loves hugging people and he kisses a lot. Especially me. I sometimes take him with me so that my cousin can catch a break(she has a 1 year old too) and it's usually him talking about everything. It's endearing. Most of the time it's something that he's told me a 100 times before but I don't really care. (The thing is, I have ADHD and my family always made fun of me for rambling on when I was a kid so I always pay attention to kids talking). While he's talking, he'd randomly reach up to my face and say \"I want to kiss you because I love you.\" And I let him. Because I don't want him to think that I hate him. It's his way of showing love. I let him do it even though it physically hurts me to do so. \n\nHe'll never know. Even if he's 13 or 30, he'll never know.

I just didn't know where else to turn to.\n\nI (32f) had a childhood bestfriend, I'll call her Jiya in this post, who I was very close to. We were always together growing up. Even when we went to different colleges, we still made time for each other and filled each other in of all the details from our life. She used to talk about this guy she was dating and I could just tell how much she loved him. I eventually met the guy and was happy to see both of them so much in love. She eventually married him and they both moved to Canada as he got a really good job there. She uprooted her life here in India and went with her husband. We were all 24 at that time. With time we got busy in our lives and the close bond that we once had, slowly faded away... Part of growing up I guess. We still stayed in touch... just not as much. \nAfter 4 years, one day i got a call from her and she asked me to meet. She told me she was back in India. I was happy to hear that but something felt off. We met and we were so happy and it felt like we were still the same. But then she broke the news to me that she and her husband got a divorce. Her reasons were just that with time they just grew apart and with both their work schedules they couldn't make time for each other. I understood that. But then she broke the even bigger news that she was pregnant with his child and that he didn't know and that she was planning to keep it that way because she wanted him to move on with his life without any attachments to him. I was shocked and I didn't approve of this at all but it was her child hence she was the one to decide afterall. She wanted to have a life of her own back where her parents lived and wanted to give birth to this child. I asked her what her parents had to say about this and she said they were supportive of whatever she wanted. What I was feeling was a mixture of emotions... As i was happy to have her here but also sad that she was going to face all this on her own. I decided to support her on every step of the way and be the best aunt to that child ever. \nTime passed and she gave birth to a beautiful baby boy, Rehan (fake name) and for a second everything felt peaceful. She was so happy. She moved back into her parents' house who were more than happy to take care of both her and the baby. It seemed like everything was going to be okay. But peace was only short-lived when only 2 years after giving birth to the baby, my friend, my childhood friend who was like a sister to me passed away.\nI won't be going into details but she had some terrible health issues and she couldn't fight them anymore. We were all devastated. It felt like I lost a part of myself. I couldn't even imagine what her parents were going through. I wanted to be there for them in whatever way possible. They were old and Jiya was their only daughter. I was worried how they would take care of Rehan who was now 2 and now didn't have a mother. We had a serious discussion one day and I asked them if they would be okay taking all the responsibilities. I even brought up Rehan's father because he still didn't know anything about his son. But aunt seemed a bit agitated and it felt like she wanted to say something but wasn't able to. I asked her what it was and after a bit of hesitation, she finally spoke. She asked me if I would like to be a parent to their grandson. I was shocked. I didn't know what to say. They asked me to not dismiss the idea altogether and to just think about it. I said okay and went home.\nWhat they asked of me was huge but it also kinda made sense, I guess? They were old and they couldn't possibly take care of a child on their own. On the other hand I've been a part of their lives since Jiya and I were 8 and a part of Rehan's life since his birth. And I was a single woman who didn't really have any plans of getting married. I did plan on having kids at one point in life but I just never got around to it. And with Jiya and Rehan, I just felt like it was enough. I decided to adopt Rehan. I informed Uncle and Aunty that I'll do it and they started crying. My parents were also supportive because they were going to be grandparents as well. Amidst everything, things somewhat seemed okay.\nI legally adopted Rehan as my son and even though the process took some time... It was worth it. Rehan is 3 now and I was happy taking caring of him and him having two sets of grandparents was kinda nice. Losing Jiya was a shock to all of us but her death brought all of us even closer than before and we became a family.\nAll of a sudden I got a news from Aunty. That Jiya's ex husband has come back to India. And that he wanted to have dinner with them. Aunt told me that he informed them  he never really got married after Jiya and that he was devastated by the news and he was sorry that he couldn't come to the funeral but now that he was here, he wanted to be there for them. Aunty understood his position but she was worried about how things will turnout so, she asked me to join them as well. The Dinner is in 4 days and I am scared. Rehan is my child. He is a part of my best friend. I am scared that if I see Rehan's father, I'd feel so guilty and Jiya's parents and I, we might blurt out the truth. And if we do so... I'm afraid that he'll try to take Rehan away from us. A lot of things that can go wrong. I'm not sure how to approach this situation. Rehan's father is not a bad person but he might (and mostly definitely will) feel betrayed that he didn't know about all this that we hid his own son from him. We're not sure how to face him and we know we're in the wrong here. We just don't know if we should tell him about his son and if we do, how he will react and what he'll do and what we can do to convince him to not take him away from us. We're all very scared. It's making my heart feel so guilty. I know we're being selfish here. I just don't know what to do here.","upvote_ratio":0.94,"created_utc":1678640840.0},{"title":"We Autistic people do not give a fuck what you call us, just give us *actual* resources and respect us as people.","author":"AutisticFloridaMan","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TrueOffMyChest\/comments\/11ptaoe\/we_autistic_people_do_not_give_a_fuck_what_you\/","text":"Most Autism charities don\u2019t give a fuck about people with Autism, much less Autistic adults.

The only thing I would say we really went out on was his cake and the table for the desserts. We rented out a not so fancy area as our house is too small. I had plenty of games and prizes for the kids.

So I\u2019m now 23 years old and accept white chocolate bunnies every year on Easter and probably will continue until the day he dies cause I don\u2019t want to break his heart. So I will continue to get the white chocolate bunny because it makes my grandfather so happy that he can show his oldest granddaughter that she\u2019s still his number 1.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1678603542.0},{"title":"Im in the happiest stage of my life!","author":"dagryy","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TrueOffMyChest\/comments\/11px9pg\/im_in_the_happiest_stage_of_my_life\/","text":"Hey,\nreading trough this sub made me realize that many people feel down.\n\nI was feeling depressed for the last 3-4 years, but since 6month my life has completly changed.\nI found a fun and good paying job, i have enough food on the table and healthy family and friends.\nI am thankful for everything, and if you read this just know that better times will come!\n\nSending love to every stranger out there","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1678673758.0},{"title":"I slept with a very famous politician(Female) when I was in high school a few times and she told me some pretty dark things.","author":"Gloomy_Painter_7392","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TrueOffMyChest\/comments\/11pvtgv\/i_slept_with_a_very_famous_politicianfemale_when\/","text":"I grew up in the northeast and I went to high school with a woman who\u2019s now in the us congress.

She's an MA student and does some tutoring on the side. Meanwhile, I used to work as a writer. Because the pay was low, I had to work three jobs to support our living (rent, bills, food, etc.). She chips in for minor things like food from time to time, but the bulk of our bills still fell on me. We've talked about this though, and I was totally fine with this setup. Then, at the start of 2021, I took in my brother when he was kicked by my parents after coming out as gay. A lot of things happened, but long story short, we were essentially cut off from our parents so we didn't have financial support from them. Also, because of that, my brother had severe mental health issues, so he was seeing a therapist, which, while absolutely necessary, still cost a lot. I didn't mind though because, again, I love my brother and I'd do anything for him.\n\nLater that year, my brother started college, and because he's brilliant, he's on a full scholarship for his tuition. He also has a small monthly allowance for school-related expenses, but that's nowhere near enough to cover all of his living costs.\n\nSo, just to recap, I am now essentially supporting three people (myself, my gf, and my bro). I then got a new job as a manager later that year, which pays more than all my former jobs combined. We were kinda living comfortably, but we didn't really have buffers for huge emergencies and luxuries.\n\nThe three of us were living happily. We're also close with my bro's boyfriend, who comes over often.\n\nThen, last October, everything changed when my brother was diagnosed with a heart condition that required surgery. The surgery cost about $37k when converted in US dollars, and while that might seem cheap for a heart surgery, it certainly wasn't for someone like us who has very little savings. From where we're from, our only option was to pay out of pocket or let insurance pay for it if we were covered. Unfortunately, my brother doesn't have insurance since he's still a student. I've also consulted my girlfriend's aunt who's a nurse and she guided us through our options, which weren't a lot to begin with.\n\nWhen I checked my bank account, I had about like $5k. My girlfriend volunteered to chip in with like $2k of her money and $5k from her parents (they've been angels to us), but I told her I'd only accept it as last resort. My bro's bf also chipped in like $300 (he's also in college, so this was essentially his entire savings). I then sucked it up and turned to my parents, who, after quite a lot of guilt tripping and nagging, agreed to cover $10k as well (we were not from a wealthy family, so that was already a huge amount for us). I then tried for government subsidy and was approved a $5k loan as well, then a charity covered another $5k. To cover the rest, I swallowed my pride and reached out to everyone I knew. After a lot of begging, groveling, taking on freelance projects, doing odd jobs, and basically doing everything I can, I finally came up with the amount.\n\nMy brother was eventually scheduled for surgery 2 weeks before Christmas, and it was thankfully successful.\n\nNow, he's on his way toward a full recovery, but for the last 5 months, I feel like I've just been really suffocated by the whole situation. Don't get me wrong, I'm not blaming him. I'm also not blaming our parents because, despite our differences and their strong feelings against my brother's sexuality, still came through with the financial support when we needed it. \n\nBut now, my brother has maintenance meds that cost a lot. From here on out, it just seems like one expense after another, and I'd like to think that I'm doing the best I can to make things work for us. It's just that I feel like whenever I get a bit of reprieve from all our burdens, a curveball is always thrown our way that keeps us stuck or even worse off. And worst of all is that I feel really guilty feeling this way.\n\nI don't want to make the situation about me because it really isn't. I also don't want my brother to feel like he's a burden due to his condition because I don't see it that way. But for the first time in my life, I just had an emotional breakdown in front of my girlfriend last night when we were discussing our future. She's set to finish her studies this year, so hopefully we can move forward financially when she also gets a full-time job, but I just can't help but think that something new would come up that would cause us to sink once again.\n\nI also feel really guilty because my girlfriend has pointed out that I've become quite distant and irritable lately. She said that while she understands the pressure I'm under, it's become quite frustrating and is affecting everyone I'm living with, especially my brother (he talked to her about it and asked if he did something wrong). I talked to them and apologized for my behavior, and I assured my brother that I don't resent him or feel like he's a burden (this has been a major issue for him ever since he was kicked out and became suicidal over that).\n\nI don't know. I'm sorry if this has been all over the place and really incoherent. I'm really just rambling now, but yeah, now I gotta focus on paying back all the loans I've incurred. I've never been in debt before (I was also on scholarship in college) so I'm just kinda overwhelmed with everything that's happening. I've also created a plan, and as long as I work every holiday and on Saturdays and don't get sick in the next 7 years, then I'll be all good. But yeah, I'm just really tired. Don't worry, I'm not suicidal though. I love my brother and my gf too much for that. It's just that...I really just want to rest and breathe for like 2 days with just myself and my hobbies, but yeah, maybe someday.","upvote_ratio":0.88,"created_utc":1678649360.0},{"title":"I opened up to my girlfriend and its kinda nice","author":"Deathstroke6627","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TrueOffMyChest\/comments\/11pvhr6\/i_opened_up_to_my_girlfriend_and_its_kinda_nice\/","text":"I just wanted to tell someone, anyone how I feel, still feels kind of weird to tell people how I feel. \n\nAnyway here goes. So I (23) have known my girlfriend (21) for 4 months, we've been dating for about a month now. The day before yesterday the topic of feelings and such came up, and how men, or well me at least, have never really talked to anyone about anything, just kinda dealt with it you know... put it in a bottle toss it and try forget about it if anything ever bothers you. \n\nAnd to my surprise she understood, wasn't pushy about it, just told me I could trust her. Wich for some reason I did. I've never been one to trust anyone with my feelings, just too scared of the unpredictable outcome of sharing. \n\nSo I told her about how I've never shared with anyone, how I've never trusted anyone, how there's always the stories about guys sharing their feelings just for it be used against them, how I've never just cried and let all my emotions out because \"men don't do that\", and even cried just letting it all out.\n\nAnd all she did was listen, comforting me, telling me I can cry in her arms when I need to and that she's always there for me. She just let me share and unload half a lifetime's worth of emotions. I even told her about all my insecurities, things that hurt me in past relationships, the reason why I do certain things a certain way. She never snapped, never got annoyed or uncomfortable, just supported me.\n\nEven more surprising is I don't feel any weaker for sharing and displaying my emotions, don't feel like any less of a man for being vulnerable. \n\nStill feels weird to and wrong to tell people how I feel but after that I feel I can share it here, still not sure why I want to do that, guess I just want to tell people and get everything off my chest.\n\nDespite the hesitation to share I do feel I have somewhat of a newfound freedom.

I suspect he may have been slightly embarrassed about that evening. Whilst I reassured him about it I didn\u2019t want to push the subject and make him regret doing it in the first place. \n\nUnfortunately a few days ago his poor mum passed. I managed to see her a couple of days before and my boyfriend saw her the evening before. Once he found out he shut himself in his office for hours. I tried knocking several times but never got a response. I could hear him moving around in there so I knew he was physically ok. Late in the afternoon he eventually came out and sat down with me to watch tv. Neither of us said Anything but he looked rough as can be. I placed my hand on his knee and we both just sat there watching. \n\nI was kind of panicking because I couldn\u2019t think of anything to say that would make any difference to his pain. I got him to eat something and we just sat there. A couple of hours later he said that he was going to shower. Originally I just said alright but then maybe 5 mins later I realised that he probably wanted me to shower with him again but didn\u2019t feel comfortable asking. Kind of kicked myself for not thinking to offer him it earlier. Guess I was so caught up in thinking about what I should say that I completely forgot that I don\u2019t actually need to say anything but can show it instead. I undressed and joined him, it was a similar experience to the previous shower. It was a very intimate experience. Although I obviously don\u2019t enjoy the reason why we were doing it, I very much enjoyed taking care of him. \n\nOnce we got out I again dried him off and I walked & tucked him into bed. Now this next part might be a tad controversial but me and him both smoke cannabis occasionally. I normally will not allow any to be smoked in the house as personally I think the smell it leaves is unpleasant and grubby. On this occasion though I figured it would help him sleep and so got one of my pre rolls. We both smoked it in bed whilst watching tv. He looked really upset and I was honestly surprised he hadn\u2019t cried so far. Some users previously mentioned that I asked if he was ok too much so I made sure not to this time and didn\u2019t press it. \n\nI turned out the lights and we both tried to get some sleep. I could hear him sniffling a bit so turned over and curled up against him in his arms.  I didn\u2019t say anything just layed there with him.  I fell asleep pretty quickly but my cat woke me up maybe an hour later and he was still awake. I moved up and swapped to being the one doing the holding. I rubbed his back and kissed his forehead. He just suddenly began crying. Not just the normal day to day tears you see from some people, these were heart broken tears. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve actually ever witnessed anyone cry that hard in real life. It\u2019s a sound I never want to hear again. The pain he was feeling must have been insane. Again he buried his face in my chest and just cried and cried . I could literally feel him shaking. We were lying there for hours. I had my arms around him and one leg over him. he was squeezing me so tightly the whole time. He would occasionally drift off loosening his grip on me in the process before waking up, starting to have some more tears and almost grabbing at me, pulling himself into me again. As though he was afraid he\u2019d wake up and I wouldn\u2019t be there. It was heart breaking. Every time I\u2019d just squeeze him back and whisper that I\u2019m there or something similar. I\u2019d kiss his head and rub his back until he drifted off again. He never stayed asleep for long though. \n\nHe properly fell asleep after maybe 3 or 4 hours of this drifting. and I stayed awake for maybe an hour past that just holding him. In the morning I woke up first and when he woke he lay there for a moment before the tears started flowing again. We stayed in bed all morning just embracing each other. A user mentioned before that two people, lying naked together being vulnerable is the ultimate intimacy and honesty now I couldn\u2019t agree more. I\u2019ve never felt so close to someone. I was feeling so many emotions it was intense. \n\nHe\u2019s cried in my arms a couple more times since at Random points of the day.  Whilst I\u2019m obviously devastated  for him  I can\u2019t help but be so so grateful he\u2019s willing to allow me to be there for him. Crying in daylight out of bed is a huge step from only allowing himself to do it once in a dark bedroom. I\u2019m honestly honoured that he trusts me so much. Hopefully he continues to allow me to be there for him in whatever capacity possible. \n\nToday I saw a tiktok video where a girl was mocking an ex for crying infront of her and it enraged me. I cannot begin to imagine how these people think like this, to have someone willing to be as vulnerable as possible in front of you, to be Comfortable asking for help in their darkest hour and then Turing around and fucking mocking them for it?! It\u2019s disgusting and I am so so so so glad I am not one of these awful people. \n\nAnyway that\u2019s it out, just reading it back I can see how insanely long it is! I\u2019m sorry.

I will try to keep it vague for anonymous reasons. I'll call them \"P\"\n\nI was only a teenager(female for context). Fresh into a huge high school from a tiny elementary. I didn't know about toxic relationships or abusive situations, My younger friends and I all were luckily from good homes. But oh boy did you open my eyes.\n\nIt was love at first sight. I can remember the day so well even now. Our eyes met across the class table and I think I nearly melted into my chair. It started out so pure and the sparks were unbelievable. When I look back on the memories with you, I try to remember the good ones. I wish you were the person you presented as. Not the one under that mask you wore. \n\nIt started off the usual; P was not getting along with my oldest friends. Which slowly led into being told not to hang out with those friends. They were \"bad influences, stupid, annoying, etc\". I lost them all and became isolated - entirely focused on P. Then it was slowly pulling me away from my family, unravelling the close bonds I had with my parents and siblings. My dad hated P - looking back, he had good reason to. But P constantly encouraged me to pack a little bag and come live at their house with their family. \n\nP's family was not the greatest. Their mom was an addict, their siblings were left neglected. That's when it got bad. But I stayed at their house through most of it. I \"lived\" there almost more than I was at home.\n\nP often threw me against walls, pinned me there or on the floor to scream in my face about any little flaw they could find in me. If I went to visit a friend, or if a male friend texted me - I was in trouble. I would go to their house after and be screamed at for hours. P called me every name in the book. But after they would pull me close and hug me, tell me they only want to \"keep me safe\" because they loved me. I remember P pinning me to the wall with their arm and screaming so harshly there was spit coming out of their mouth. \n\nThen it got worse. They would push me around, grab my wrist so hard it bruised. Then the hitting began. The first time P hit me, my lip split wide open. I think in that moment maybe they had a realization of what they did, P tried to comfort me but I ran home in the snow late at night. I told everyone I had a coldsore. They didn't hit much after that, but they did still physically hurt me when they could. I'm a petite girl, even more then, it didn't take much effort.\n\nThen one night, we had an argument. I can't remember what it was about, but the next thing I know, P's hands are around my throat and they pushed me to the ground. P tightened their grip and I was trying to grab their hands away. I remember I was crying at that point. My vision started to go dark and it felt like I couldn't fight anymore. Then P rolled off me. Adrenaline kicked me up onto my feet and I cowered against the wall catching my breath while we just stared at each other. \n\nThere was so much more that I don't think I have the energy to type. P cheated on me, spread lies about me, would throw me out of their house at any time of day for any reason. Kept me from going to school because I might interact with other men. And so much more.. If I tried to leave, they would threaten to take their own life. I was nearly SA'd and you blamed me! Asked what I was wearing and how I let myself get into that situation.\n\nWhy did I stay? I gave five years of my life to this person who used me as a punching bag. I wasn't a person. From 15 years old until I was 20... Now I'm about to reach 30 and it still lingers in my mind. I still shrink away when a man is yelling. I can hardly handle a normal couple's fight in my relationships. Someone moves too quickly and I flinch, my heart races. I fear men. I don't trust men. I've been battling depression and anxiety for most of my life. It has ruined many relationships and friendships. I've had to rebuild everything I am from the ground up, and I still don't feel whole. I don't feel like a person worthy of existing.\n\nI can forgive you P, but I don't want to. We were just dumb teenagers in a bad situation, but wherever you are, I do hope karma came and hit you back for me. I'm done holding this all in. I'm sick of my stomach dropping every time a door is closed a little too loudly, or when someone even shows the slightest amount of anger around me. \n\nAnd I hope to never see you again.","upvote_ratio":0.81,"created_utc":1678674186.0},{"title":"Missing my ex","author":"Dekusenpai777","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TrueOffMyChest\/comments\/11pxcm9\/missing_my_ex\/","text":"Sometimes I fear that I will never find someone that fits me as he did.

I don\u2019t know if I panicked because I was brand new working BOH and i was struggling or what. It hit the ground then I picked it up immediately but I still know it was so so wrong. How often do you think a small restaurant chain checks their cameras? If they do and they see what I\u2019ve done, I\u2019ll be fired. Rightfully so.

I\u2019ve agreed to a coffee but I\u2019m nervous as fuck.\n\nOur relationship was always a bit of a rollercoaster, we went through some really tough times in our own lives and supported each other through it, but in the final year or so it got bad. His alcoholism got 100x worse and his personality changed dramatically. He became utterly miserable and made it his mission to drag me down with him. The kind, empathetic, fiercely loyal, intelligent, strongly principled, supportive, open-minded man became cruel, callous, entitled, self-destructive, manipulative, and selfish. He lost a lot of friends during that time because of it. At some point I realised I was enabling by allowing him to treat me like shit, mending his burned bridges for him (unbeknownst to him due to his blackouts), being his free therapist and talking him down from the ledge etc.\n\nI was a fragile shell of my old self by the time we split for good. I recovered quite well, I even found someone who treated me with real love and respect for a while (we aren\u2019t together anymore for unrelated reasons and are on good terms). As far as I heard through the grapevine, he got sober not long after we split and began to piece his life together, which I think must have been hard af since even more traumatic shit happened to him (not his fault) after we split. I think he even found a nice stable woman to settle with and I have no doubt she likely has 0 idea of what kinda of monster alcohol had turned him into before.\n\nNearly 2 years of no contact later, I get a message from him out of the blue asking if I would be okay with meeting up for coffee because he wanted to make amends for what happened, but he understood if I wasn\u2019t comfortable with that. My heart jumped into my stomach. Now, by this time I\u2019ve made my peace already. I processed how things got to that point, shit I\u2019d even forgiven him and have no hate towards him. At the same time I still kinda want to hear it come from his mouth in person. I used to dream that one day he would apologise and now that the possibility has actually become reality, I don\u2019t know how to handle it. I did a little stalk and it seems likely he might be moving cities soon (has a new job there) so I don\u2019t think this is him trying to get in my pants. He was never that type of person anyway even when things were bad (a shit, neglectful mess of a partner but not a \u201cmanipulate you to stay\u201d or unfaithful one). \n\nI\u2019ve agreed to meet him on Tuesday on my lunch break for a quick coffee. I\u2019m still nervous as fuck and I\u2019m hoping I made the right call. I know I don\u2019t owe him shit but he was a massive part of my life and I do hold some value to what we had before things went tits up. Fuck.","upvote_ratio":0.87,"created_utc":1678620075.0},{"title":"I\u2019m not sure if I should continue my hobby.","author":"Dependent_Wasabi2499","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TrueOffMyChest\/comments\/11pyzih\/im_not_sure_if_i_should_continue_my_hobby\/","text":"It\u2019s gotten to the point where I don\u2019t even know if I have enough time to do the hobby I truly desire doing (art), I wake up every day and do the exact same thing, weekday or weekend.

So about 2 1\/2 years. Throughout the relationship, he never wanted to spend time with me. He was always too nervous to hang out with me around my family, but hardly ever wanted me to come to his house either. He never wanted to call, and would pretty much ignore me when we did to play video games with his brother. He stood me up on the Fourth of July, and granted I was grounded so he couldn\u2019t contact me to change plans, but my parents were sympathetic and let me use my phone that night, and he hadn\u2019t texted at all. I asked what the hell happened and he basically said he got too nervous. He pulled that sort of thing at least two more times over the course of the relationship. We argued a lot over that, and he\u2019d always make promises to change and never would. Once, I sent him a long paragraph about how he never puts effort into anything, and he felt bad and promised me that he would learn to put more effort into stuff, and never did. I put up with so much. So essentially, the relationship was sucky.\n\nDuring our relationship though, I found music, and decided that I want to pursue it as a career. It\u2019s my biggest passion in life and tbh I think I\u2019m pretty good at it. But soon after I found it, he found it too, and decided the same thing. So part of my anger in this whole situation is that it was mine first.\n\nThe main part of this though is that he doesn\u2019t work on anything BUT music. He has a horrible GPA (last I knew at least, but I\u2019m sure it hasn\u2019t changed), no job, can\u2019t get his license because he has panic attacks when he gets behind the wheel (I know I shouldn\u2019t be judgmental of this part because he did have a bad car accident when he was younger. I guess I just associate it with all the excuses about being too anxious to hang out with me that he never pushed against at all. So just take this for what you will), and he\u2019s honestly very emotionally immature (as evidenced by my junior year when he apologized for everything, which I was grateful for and genuinely wanted to be friends, but he couldn\u2019t accept that and kept trying to get me to break up with my now bf to get back with him).\n\nSo there\u2019s all that. Jump to this year, senior year. The talent show was 4 days ago, and he and his band won. I ended up not even competing because of all the homework I have, but I\u2019m somewhat glad now because I know I would\u2019ve lost to them and that would be a hard punch to the ego. But this has just been driving me insane. Every year that they\u2019ve announced that the talent show is coming up, I start getting crazy anxious. I\u2019m in constant competition with him and he doesn\u2019t even know it. I\u2019m terrified that he\u2019s better than me at music. If he is, it\u2019s only because he REFUSES to do anything that he doesn\u2019t want to do, while I\u2019m juggling high school (trying to graduate salutatorian), a college class, an EMT class, and my job as a manager for the local movie theater. I don\u2019t have the time to practice, and now he\u2019s being rewarded for doing like %5 of what I do with everything I want. It\u2019s driving me insane.\n\nTL\/DR: My shitty ex refuses to do anything except work on music, while I\u2019m juggling responsibilities and have no time to practice. As a result, he won the talent show and I didn\u2019t even end up competing because of lack of time, and I feel as though he\u2019s getting everything I\u2019ve ever wanted as reward for being lazy.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678677574.0},{"title":"I think I completely messed up my relationship with my best friend","author":"AdIndependent4103","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TrueOffMyChest\/comments\/11pyf9w\/i_think_i_completely_messed_up_my_relationship\/","text":"To be honest I\u2019m not quite sure where to begin but I got to start from somewhere.\n\nEnd of senior year a girl made a comment about one of my friends which I ended up expressing the comments to her because I couldn\u2019t withhold that kind of thing.

I don't know if this belongs here. If it doesn't, do what you must. I'm 29 now. It all started four years ago when I thought I was in a healthy relationship. My depression is manageable overall, but when something triggers it, I can be down for a couple weeks. At that time, my then bf invited me to his  niece's baptism. I was in a depression and to make a long story short, I ruined the reception of that event when ppl overheard me sobbing into the phone to my older brother. When I understood what I actually did (a wk or so), I apologized to my bf and his family profusely. I owned up to it. They led me to believe I was forgiven. Boy was I an idiot to believe them. \nA year passed, and bf's other sister had a wedding. His family went behind my back and didn't invite me, then they left it up to him to tell me last minute. Of course, I didn't take it well. I told him I thought they forgave me. He said that they didn't trust me in family events due to my mental health. He justified going behind my back as well. We took a break, and you guessed it, I was stupid enough to take him back. His family at that point never talked to me, never bought me gifts at Christmas. (My family didn't ghost him). The baptism was like a light switch with them. How dare I suffer from a common condition that I go to therapy for. His mom would make him skip our dates at last minute to make him do things. It later got to the point that we only saw each other once a wk as his work schedule was also demanding. I once told him that if he treated me half as good as he treated his family, I'd never complain. Excuses. Excuses. He eventually broke up with me. I knew his family was involved b\/c he didn't have the balls to do it w\/o their involvement. Now I'm with my longtime best friend, who is my new bf and life is good.

My long time partner and live in girlfriend broke up with me. Seems standard but the reason got to me.\n\nI was driving home from work and I call her. Cause I always call her on my way home to check in. She sounded off and so I started prodding. She lets it slip that she wants to breakup.  While I\u2019m driving, I become hysterical and have to a abandon my car on the side of the road and my family had to drive out to get me.\n\nI call her again minutes later. I needed an explanation and she just blurts out on the phone she wanted an open relationship. Now from my time on the internet and life. If someone suddenly proposes a open relationship in a previously monogamous one, it may be a sign that they have cheated \/ have someone in mind. \n\nIt\u2019s a huge red flag. I will add she had gotten cold towards me for a while and had joked about going on \u201cfriend dates\u201d.\n\nAfter staying the night with my parents I went over the day after to get most of my stuff, I ask her to fully explain herself. Her answer was simply she fell out of love with me and she hasn\u2019t loved me in a long time. She then decided the best option was to ask her college friends.\n\nThey suggested we start an open relationship. I was furious. I don\u2019t know who thinks that\u2019s the solution to a relationship issue. I got angry and took my stuff and left. She threw away 4 years because she wasn\u2019t willing to be an adult and talk to me. \n\nShe also added she felt like she had no options because I wasn\u2019t home enough and didn\u2019t give her enough affection. \n\nI will also add I\u2019m the only one of us who has a job. She does college \u201cfull time\u201d\n(She has only 3 classes and spends most of her days out with friends while I work 40-50 hours a week) and I did almost all house chores except dishes. \n\nI\u2019m now scrambling because I don\u2019t have a home anymore and we adopted a cat. \n\nShe is unable to care for the cat as she gets overwhelmed at scooping litter and basic care. Currently the cat is still with her but when I went to get my stuff it was clear litter had not even been scooped once and was overflowing as well as the cat didn\u2019t have food in the bowl. Don\u2019t get me started on her and the rats. She refuses to clean there cage so that also falls on me. \n\nToday I\u2019m going to get my animals. My mom is willing to see if we can house them here. \n\nThat\u2019s all. I lost 4 years over someone who saw me as a mother and not a partner. Sorry for any formatting issues.\n\n\n\nEdit\/update\n\nto clear up some frequent asked questions and concerns. \n\nOne- we did not have an appartment. We lived in a home owned by her father as her family is very well off. The home was payed for and we where not asked to pay rent. I covered all utilities month by month. She dose not have my cards anymore so clean split on finances. No joint accounts thank god.\n\nTwo- pets all safe with me now. Writing this as my cat attacks her toy mice at the food of my bed. I got all my stuff today with my parents. Everything that I payed for, so the bed, sofa. All the decorations, my wine glasses ect. Rats are also safe and have a nice cozy space to adjust. Happy boys are getting plenty of food and love in a newly cleaned cage. Kitty has a spotless litter box \n\nThree- I have blocked her on all media. Thank you all for your concern. Now that the anger has subsided I\u2019m ready to be myself. I\u2019ve missed a lot so I\u2019m ready to find myself. I also understand she was very sheltered and spoiled, she was never truly ready or prepared for something serious. That I find comfort in.

A year before we started hooking up he got divorced and I lost my mom to brain cancer. We were definitely both in a fragile place when we met. It wasn't until I moved out of state that he insisted we be exclusive. The relationship was nice in a lot of ways but also extremely toxic. When I moved out to where I am now, he would fly out every other weekend. But he has three kids from 2 marriages and is seventeen years older than me. I think we both knew in the back of our heads this wasn't extremely realistic. \n\nWell in August reality caught up with us and we broke up. It was hard, really really hard because I became attached to him at such a weird time. But after a few months of not being with him I found that things started to really improve for me. (Career wise, socially, etc..) \n\nAnyways, ever since we broke up he will pop in every few months to say he misses me and that he loves me and doesn't know what to do, etc. Last time this happened was around new years and I was almost buying into it but then I did a bit of digging and found out he was seeing someone else seriously (and flying out to see THEM now like he did with me. This girl lives about 30 mins from me.) SO i blocked him and told him to please leave me alone. \n\nWeeks go by and he sends me flowers, food, gifts, he messages me on facebook and from a burner account on instagram. He's saying all these things asking me to please just let me hear him out, that he loves me, that he broke things off with that girl etc. etc. etc. \n\nI finally cave and unblock him but I'm still doing a good job holding my own (not talking to him everyday etc.)  But then before I realize it's happening we start talking almost every day again. He then says he booked a flight to come see me. I did not ask him to do this. In fact at first I told him absolutely not. But then as the day got closer I just ended up being excited to see him. So I go get him from the airport and we spend 24 hours together. Once we are together it feels just like before so we're holding hands, laughing, going out to eat. I ask him to take a photo of me wearing his jacket, he takes a bunch and they're all cute and it's just lighthearted and easy.\n\nThe next morning, I drop him off at the airport, we say goodbye and do a cute hug and that we will see each other soon because I am going home to visit family in a few weeks (which is where he lives.) \n\nI spend the rest of the day giddy, but in the back of my head knowing this was stupid because due to circumstances we wont really ever work out. Like I said, he has three kids and a business etc at home and I am just starting my life out here. \n\nI post one of the photos he took of me to instagram and thought nothing of it. It went with my feed, no one here knows him or his apparel because why would they. It's not like he's in it. No captions alluding to him. Nothing. It's just me looking like a fun girl wearing a jacket. \n\nThis man LOST his mind. He texts me saying this is why we will never work, tells me to  never speak to him again, asking why I would think it's okay to post a photo wearing his jacket (mind you, he took this photo, and was laying in bed with me while I was choosing which one to post.) He then blocks me on everything. Obviously the girlfriend he promised he did not have saw it and now he's just thrown me to the curb. \n\nBasically posting here because I don't need relationship advice. I am not at a loss about what to do. This man has no respect for me. I do not want a relationship with him, I don't think I ever really wanted it while we were together. I am so much better off mentally\/emotionally\/etc. when I am not talking to him. I have a lot going for me and a project I'm working on is getting the backing it needs and I've been putting myself out there more, it\u2019s like when I remove him from the equation things start going great again lol. \n\n  \nIt's just such a heavy feeling right now. It's hard to focus, I don't want to think about him as he is terrible for me. But whenever I think of him with this other girl my heart hurts so much. He felt like my safe space for two years and I hate to think he never really was to begin with. \n\n(This helped so much thank you for letting me vent <3 )   \n\n\n**TLDR; My ex blocked me after insisting on flying out to see me and now I feel anxious.**","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1678618838.0},{"title":"If you have a job, do it.

After I came back, he had done one piece. One.\n\nI told my supervisor again that he's doing absolutely nothing if someone isn't constantly watching him. I was placed next to him at a machine where he's de-nesting while I'm forming parts (bending them into shape). He stood there for three hours on his phone.

I don\u2019t go out to eat at a restaurant often specifically because it\u2019s expensive, and when I do it\u2019s a special occasion. Thing is though as expensive as eating out is you have to add a tip on top and they want you to base it on how much you spend, if I\u2019m taking a small group out to celebrate and I already spent $100 on just the food the last thing I want to do is spend 15-20% on a tip. \n\nNow don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019ve had servers that made me actually WANT to tip and I have no problem with that, but a tip SHOULD be a way to show appreciation for exemplary service, not a hidden fee that the nice but ordinary server expects. \n\nThen to make matters worse if you\u2019re a regular non tipper then restaurants can refuse you service, obviously they have the right to refuse service to anyone but that\u2019s something you have to worry about because they have done it to people. What\u2019s even worse is fast food workers making minimum wage work harder in some instances and don\u2019t even consider getting a tip. Having worked both I know both can be stressful but depending on the job\/time\/location but servers make more due to tips or at least are guaranteed minimum wage. I\u2019ve seen some of my former co workers brag about how much they average an hour in tip. \n\n\nEven the whole method at which tips are given can be messed up. One thing that really shocked me is when I talked to the hardest working server at one of my jobs (I\u2019m not gonna lie and say I was anywhere near the hardest, a very stressful job that want for me) and he was making much less than some of the female employees, including some of the ones who put more effort into complaining how hard their job is then the effort they put in their actual job. I\u2019m not saying some of those tips weren\u2019t earned obviously but it was frustrating to see one person averaging $40+\/ hour in tips when the hardest working people (certain high stress positions in the kitchen) were making a dollar or two above minimum wage.\n\nAgain, I\u2019m ok with tipping for excellent customer service but anytime I do I feel like I\u2019m lowballing the server because it\u2019s the same amount I\u2019d pay a non-excellent server who might not have even earned it. \n\nBut of course it gets worse. When I get my hair cut it takes 15-30 mins and costs $40 and they ask if I want to leave a tip. Now hear me out, there\u2019s one barber that I tip every time he cuts my hair. Most of the others take 20 minutes and ask for a tip and originally I\u2019d add like $5 cuz I knew they were watching. But in my financial situation getting my hair cut is the monthly privilege I look forward to the most. Now there\u2019s one barber he\u2019s only cut my hair twice . He took 15 minutes on the left side and from the way he was doing it I could tell I was going to love it. I ended up tipping a whole $20 when I saw it and that might not be much to many but to me that\u2019s insane and I didn\u2019t regret it. Im not gonna go into my bad experiences but in short I find it hard enough (on my wallet) to spend that much on a haircut but it\u2019s where all my self confidence stems from. Believe it or not I\u2019ve become far more productive throughout the month when I stopped cutting my own hair.\n\nDutch bros as another example. they pain me the most when they ask for a tip. Like what would you like a tip for; making a drink or taking the order? I\u2019ve never had Dutch in my life as my limit for expensive coffee is one or two pumpkin spice lattes from Starbucks in October. So every time I go there I can\u2019t even tip because it\u2019s not my money it\u2019s for a friend. It still bugs me though. Some of them are shy about it and just turn the tip screen to me so I can comfortably tap no and some of them prey in my emotions by forcing me to say \u201cno I don\u2019t want to tip you for doing your job for two seconds before you go back to talking to your coworkers\u201d obviously that\u2019s not how it goes but they still ask me to make me say no out loud. \n\nI understand some people are only able to afford to make a living because of tips but it shouldn\u2019t be that way. I\u2019d rather restaurants raise their prices so I know what I\u2019m paying from the beginning and if they earned a tip I will gladly fork over half an hour of wages (sometimes more \ud83d\ude0f) \n\nAnd for the record, my main job is doordash so I rely solely on tips to make money if that means anything to you.","upvote_ratio":0.77,"created_utc":1678648580.0},{"title":"Each year, I find birthdays sadder. It sucks.","author":"BirthdaysSuck2208","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TrueOffMyChest\/comments\/11ppsju\/each_year_i_find_birthdays_sadder_it_sucks\/","text":"For personal reasons, this is a throwaway.\n\nI reworded it to make sure it fit the sub more clearly, in case the title somehow didn\u2019t make it clear. \n\nAs every year around this time of year, my birthday draws near.\n\nAnd as every year, I can\u2019t wait until the time passes.\n\nWhen I was a kid, I had a step family who outright made me hate my birthday. It would always be a bleak event where I was reminded how little I accomplished, how little anyone cared about it and how it wasn\u2019t a day of importance to anyone.\nEven my mistreatment wasn\u2019t special as all of the kids in the family received a similar speech. (Although, the blood children did receive better gifts than I did).\n\nSo to spite them, I used my birthdays as an excuse to hang out with my friends, gathering a large crowd of children and teens to eat pizza and play Super Smash into the deep night. It was a great time and many good memories were made.\nIt was a way to break the bleak outlook professed by my step family and their shit life philosophy.\nNow, 20-30 years later, I\u2019ve grown up. Im far removed from my step family, have a wonderful wife and family life. Im doing great by all accounts, truly.\n\nBut as my friends have moved away and I\u2019ve gotten older, birthdays have lost their luster for me. Lately (about 5 years or so) it\u2019s as if my step family has been prophetic. And it\u2019s been weighing on my chest.\n\nOutside of my wonderful wife, nobody remembers or calls that I\u2019ve made one more turn round the sun. My best friends, my mother, they all forget. (My mother had forgotten to call last two years asan example)\n\nIf and when they do remember, it\u2019s usually as long as a month after, calling in a rush, apologizing profusely.\n\nSometimes, my wife will go out of her way and remind my friends that it\u2019s that time of the year and wouldn\u2019t it be nice to remind your friend that it\u2019s his birthday.\n\nAnd thus is the source of my blues.\n\nOn one hand, I understand that people are busy, leading hectic adult lives. I don\u2019t want to be an inconvenience to anyone, nor a source of grief. Whilst I generally reach out to my friends and family on their birthdays, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a fair standard to keep others to as you never know what they maybe up to at a given time and how busy their life may be. We all have a variety of stressors and unexpected life events keeping us in their thrall.\n\nI certainly don\u2019t want to come across as needy nor do I want to put the burden on my wife to try to cheer me up and have her herd my friends to send me coerced messages.\n\nI also don\u2019t want to make this a major point in my friendships as I\u2019ve known some these people for over 30 years and have found them to be great, kind people worthy of friendship.\n\nOn the other hand, I feel like nobody cares and during the weeks up to and including my birthday I find this upsetting, perhaps more than I should. If nothing else, I miss getting together with my friends for the event and making a long night out of it. A hard ask when everyone\u2019s got families and is scattered all over the world, working long hours and raising families.\n\nThat\u2019s all.

Basically her body goes into convulsions or paralysis for a  couple minutes as her brain resets itself due to the emotions and  stimulus that over-stresses her. She gets a few episodes a day and has  recently hurt her foot so she is very immobile right now and been living  with me the last few weeks. Last night I threw my wallet on the ground  from the bed and the loud noise made her go into an episode. Her eyes  got wide and it looked like she had PTSD. She keeps apologizing for  everything and saying it\u2019s her fault but it never is.\n\nShe  said something disturbing to me last night along the lines of \u201cI\u2019m just  trying not to feel so I don\u2019t have episodes.\u201d We got the diagnosis two  weeks ago and she\u2019s made one phone call to a psychologist for CBT  therapy.

She really has one close friend but she is a single mother of  two and lives with her parents. Her family is a toxic situation too. I  feel like I\u2019m battling this alone and I just don\u2019t know what to do.\u00a0\n\nShe\u2019s  so dependent on me and I\u2019ve felt so overburdened the last few weeks.

It seems so dumb compared to all the heavier stuff in this subreddit but I realize maybe writing these feelings down can help me lighten up a little. \n\nI'm constantly envious of my friend but feel like admitting it to her is just going to ruin our friendship, which I cherish very much. But keeping this in is killing me. \n\nWe've been friends since high school and I'm so grateful that we never lost touch, even though we don't see each other nearly as much as we did back then, our friendship remained the same. For context, we're both women in our early twenties and both are sapphic (i'm a lesbian, she's bisexual) - I greatly appreciate my sapphic friends because there's just so many similar experiences and feelings we bond over. Furthermore, I've always been the late bloomer kind, for example: I didn't have my frist kiss till I was 17 (and was the last one out of all my friend groups) and since then I just haven't been with many people, and to top it all off I've never been in a relationship. Because of that I often feel patronized by some of my more \"experienced\" friends and it is a great source of insecurity for me, but I often don't say anything and\/or just joke about it. (It is important to note that this friend of mine has always been nothing but kind and empathetic towards my insecurities - the occasional insensitive joke here and there, sure, but nothing too hurtful). \n\nThis last month I came back to my hometown since I was on a break from college and was so excited to see my friends, including the friend in question. Both of us like to party (her more so than me, as she's just more energetic and extraverted) and we made so many plans to go out, get drunk and just have a good time.

Not to mention she's conventionally very beautiful and girls always approach her. And I'm... well, not that. Not to say I'm a bummer to hang out with, I think I'm good company and all but I'm never going to be like her and (god, I really feel like a shitty and superficial person for even caring about this) I just never get noticed when I'm next to her and as much as I hate to admit it it gets to me. \n\nI already knew I was an envious person, this is not news. In fact, I've been envious of past female friendships as well and decided that drifting away was the best thing I could do so I wouldn't hurt myself or them. But now I regret dealing with things that way. I don't wanna push people I love away like this anymore. But I just don't know what to do. \n\nSo... yeah. There's no conclusion to that. Just a shitty feeling and not knowing exactly what to do with it.

She asked me if I had talked to any other woman, I said yes. Explained that I reached out to a few but she fixated on one from another country that my buddy was trying to hook me up with. She was shocked, I didn't mention said person directly. But we made our relationship work again for another month until...\n\n*see other post*\n\nAt the airport, she got a \"DM from someone who looks legit\" accusing me of cheating, said there was proof when she looked into a certain place. She refused to tell me at first and that led to me telling her straight up that I had NEVER cheated on her in any way, shape, or form.\n\nWe finally reunited after this terrible trip, we had a ton of sex, laughed, professed love. She brings up this DM and said, \"I'm so fucking stupid, I didn't screen shot that DM and the person unsent it. So now I have no idea how to find this person again.\" She then asked, \"Do you have any idea of who sent it?\"\n\nI told her about this said person, made it clear that she hurt me deeply and that I needed companionship. I made it crystal clear that I expressed interest in another woman.\n\nShe then accuses me of withholding the truth and that I'm untrustworthy. She loses her mind, tells me how terrible I am and how she absolutely hated this relationship. I basically say, \"Yes, I didn't tell you about this said person because I felt it wasn't important as there was no intimacy whatsoever and I made it clear I was not looking for anything romantic with her\" \n\nShe then asks after a ton of verbal abuse, \"How do you expect us to get to stay together and make this work?\" \n\nI said \"We don't, we're done.\" \n\nSister came and picked her stuff up from my house the next day.

Wednesday and Thursday, he contacted multiple prostitutes. Some he sent money too, one he even went to their house. But according to him, he was scammed and they took his money and never showed or he was too afraid and drove off. He says he didn't participate in any sexual activities with them, which I do believe because there is nothing in the messages to prove that he did. He told me that he's unhappy but what to afraid of hurting me to tell me. Even though he didn't physically cheat, I still view it as cheating because you planned a sexual encounter with someone who isn't your wife. I am high risk, we lost our first baby last year and this time around I'm suppose to be taking it easy but how can I do that when I've learned this news. I'm angry, hurt, and I feel betrayed. I am a damn good wife, l've been with him through multiple relapses, suicide attempts, and when he was kicked out of the military for his drinking. He does suffer from bipolar disorder, which is why he drinks.\nHe said he was having a manic episode while the cheating happened. I understand mental health and I understand that drinking makes you make stupid decisions but honestly I feel like he's issuing that as an excuse for his infidelity. I feel like I'm done but on the other hand I don't want my daughter growing up without her father, I know how it impacted me and I don't want that for her. I'm just really lost.

So thank you for that. Men, women, anyone who suffers from mental issues. You are enough. Just because someone invalidates your feelings, or doesn\u2019t make you feel like you\u2019re supposed to feel the way you do. You have every right to be uncomfortable with something. Sure, sometimes you may be wrong. It takes your self awareness to recognize that. But that doesn\u2019t mean just because you love someone means how you feel is wrong. We all have boundaries. One thing I\u2019ve learned as a man is that you have to believe in yourself first to have truly healthy relationships. I believe that to be true with women too. And everyone in between. You can\u2019t expect people to treat you better than you treat yourself. Your self respect and boundaries will always lie within you. You tolerate and accept what you allow.

I grew up in a family touched by both violent mental illness (my brother) and terminal physical illness (me - still alive because of science). One or both of these factors have made me a magnet for chaos. And here\u2019s the confession - I love it. Overcoming a challenge that would make most people piss their pants gives me such a power rush. \n\nI\u2019ve been trying to channel this positively. I\u2019ve started my own business, adopted the world\u2019s craziest and most perfect dogs, gone on a mission trip to the middle of the jungle, explored my own spirituality in intense ways. Took up Spartan race training until my health shut that down. Putting down the bottle was the best decision I\u2019ve ever made.\n\nThe one part of my life I can\u2019t seem to make progress in, is men. I\u2019ve been boy-crazy all my life, in a relationship for 19 years one after the other. The horror stories are stories I don\u2019t tell, ever. They\u2019re all different, but none are healthy. I finally married my soulmate, but we were very different people. Both stubborn, wanted our own way, and even though he married me he never fully let me in. Lots of fighting (never physical). I felt like fate had dealt me a bad soulmate hand, but jfc I loved him. Then he walked out.\n\nI spent a couple years to myself finally, and I LOVED IT. So empowering. I really got it together. Started finally loving myself. Then one day I met a guy, asked HIM out (a feat of confidence I can\u2019t believe I did), made the moves instead of following blindly. He\u2019s so nice, patient, laid-back and understanding. We\u2019ve been together almost a year\u2026 and I\u2019m bored out of my mind.\n\nWtf!?\n\nI\u2019d be okay if it\u2019s just that I\u2019m still shell-shocked after the divorce. Maybe I\u2019ve given up on love, but that would get better with time. Of course a more mature relationship decision is going to feel different. I\u2019ve always been drawn to men with baggage because I have so much baggage. I\u2019ve spent all this time waiting for this guy to open up, but now I\u2019m realizing that he\u2019s not closed off, he just doesn\u2019t have any nasty thoughts or skeletons that he\u2019s hiding. And that\u2019s a good thing! He doesn\u2019t seem to be bothered by my baggage, so it should be okay. He\u2019s supportive, and that\u2019s new. \n\nI think the thing that scares me is, what if I need the drama? I feel like there\u2019s no passion at all. The sex is not good, but that\u2019s okay too because that\u2019s easy to work on. Unless my definition of passion is wrong. On paper, this is the relationship I want. Why don\u2019t my feelings back it up? Am I just pathologically incapable of being in a healthy relationship? We never fight. I always watched my friends be in relationships like that, and I was so jealous. I hated fighting with my ex-husband. But instead it just feels like he doesn\u2019t care enough to fight with me. \n\nI like him. I just find my attention wandering more and more.

We have always been so close, he is like a big brother to me. So, I informed my boyfriend. Now the problem is my family is used to interfere a lot with my personal life before my bf taught me to put boundaries and they are homphobic. My bf doesn\u2019t want to bring that into his life so he wants me to cut contact with them as he is very private. However, I have been pushing this visit away for 6 months now and I came up with every possible excuse to the point where my cousin did not even ask to come this time he just gave me the heads up. Long story short, my bf blocked me last week as he did not want me to see them (mainly according to him in fear of them changing my mind on some topics that me and him have already established and some decision we\u2019ve taken also so that I don\u2019t skip seeing him during the weekend as I visit him every weekend and we have been doing that for 7 months non stop, I am not complaining btw i love it). I ended up postponing the visit a week further to comfort my bf and be able to spend time with him and he was okay with it. But later during the week, when friday started approaching my bf became iffy. I informed him thursday night that my other cousin (20 F) and their other cousin (24 F) are also coming immediately after I knew I also told him that the girls will be staying in a hotel while my cousin and I will stay at my place. He has already been making \u201cjokes\u201d (or so i thought) about me sleeping with my cousin in the same bed and doing sexual stuff with him (i have different pillows and covers) so he started it again. I told him that it is not even in me to think of anyone sexually let alone my cousin who I share the same blood with. He would not let go. He went as far as saying he\u2019ll sleep with someone (as a joke i hope) as well as texting a guy of the same nationality as me on tinder to get on my nevers.

At the end, I said bye as I felt disrespected and I hung up on him which is not a habit of mine. I have been blocked ever since.

It was pretty toxic and weird. Felt like we got attached and couldn't go more than 2 days without talking to each other. I had more pride than him tho so he always used to text first after we had a disagreement. The disagreement always used to revolve around me wanting to end it and him being like no blah blah. I admit I was very back and forth. After everytime we met up I felt like I was letting go of my morals and tbh it was very stressful but at the same time when I felt bored and horny I seeked him out. We never had sex I would've definitely regretted that. But I ended up sucking his dick and he touched my \ud83d\ude3a and that was only the 3rd time we met up alone. To him it wasn't a big deal even tho it was his first time doing any of that too but to me I was like wtf did I do. I rlly wanted to end it after that and I made my friends know that they have to stop me from ever meeting up with him again. That 3rd meetup felt like it was lvl 5 then it want to a 100. I couldn't handle it. I hadn't done anything with someone before him. I prided myself on waiting for college. Idk why I had that deal with myself but I messed up senior year of high school. But yeah after that I really tried keeping my distance from him and keeping the convos as casual as possible but he made jokes regarding what happened which left me shook lol. Senior trip happened but he still was talking to me and wanted pics and vids from me not nudes but just wanted to see me. I was like nahhh. I thought I was convincing myself that I was over him but then the convo turned flirtatious again and sorta reminiscent of our past experiences and I never felt as horny as I ever did. His comments weren't even sexual but it felt that he was very attentive of me. And I felt damn maybe I'm not over him. Then the next day not even 24 hours he tells me that oh I was right and we should just be friends. That felt like out of nowhere especially considering his possessive sexual msgs from the night before. I had a feeling there was a girl he wanted to date. I would've been completely fine with that if he did it when I was literally telling him to find another girl a couple days before not when he ruined my mindset of being over him. But he did it after he was being sexual w me which was rlly weird. But yeah he was putting the blame on me at first and then I got him to admit there was another girl. He didn't want to end what we had forever. I said let's end it for good and he said well I didn't expect that. I said I'm not gonna be your backup option and he started being all gaslighty and being like I didn't see u as that but if u wanna think like that... And I was just over it. The first week without talking to him was very hard and the day I saw em together for the first time hurt more than I could ever imagine. But I ended up getting used to em together and moving on. He just avoided eye contact anytime he saw me while I laughed to myself cuz it was so obvious. I was able to laugh at everything that happened between us. I don't know my feelings towards him still. I don't wanna date him but idk. He asked me in the beginning if I wanted to be in a relationship and I said no and then after that he was always like oh I don't want u attached and then sometimes he was like I think ur obsessed w me in a joking way and also saying shit like ur mine. I feel like we were both rlly confused. Him getting a gf was the best option now when I think about it. A weight feels like it's been lifted off me in a way even tho my heart hurts sometimes.

I asked him if he was ok and he said \"Realized you deserve atleast an apology or something so I decided to do the bare minimum. That's it\" I just joked around and was like ooooh character development. It's ok thx\" and he left me on seen so \ud83e\udd23 I feel like he wanted me to be honest and ig mean but I didn't do that.

So what I normally do is look for girls on tinder , see if they have Snapchat in their bio and then I text them. A lot of them won't text back but some of them do. But the conservations always seem dead and soulless , even if I try to make it feel more alive , I tried a lot of things to say to girls when I texted ( btw im in Germany and German girls are a special kind in my opinion) I had some nice conversations with girls but at the end they said they were not looking for a relationship which I obv respect so I left them alone. Then I get demotivated and suddenly I text girls on Snapchat a week later again craving that dopamine rush when she texts back , even if I just said like \"hey Lianne \" for example . I may often had the chance to meet with a girl thinking about it afterwards , like I could've said or asked different things so she might have responded differently and maybe I would have atleast gotten a number. I tried asking out girls In person but when this happens I am not myself and I talk and act like a shy 10 year old all of a sudden. I plan the asking out thing different in my head and when I talk to them I completely Flubber up my Monologue I trained in my head haha. I am really just trying to have a relationship where you care about each other. But I can't seem to break though if you know what I mean. I don't do social stuff besides work and don't have lots of friends , no female friends. I often just walk for miles hoping to approach a women outside and hopefully a girl that I like. But that never happens and  I never see woman my age outside where I live so I don't know what to do. I had so many chances at school but now I'm just at home or working. I don't know the opportunities to meet new women and getting into a relationship.

I'm not sure exactly why I'm like this, but it's to the point that I don't even bother. I can't ever unfuck a face-to-face situation by lying. It's a double-edged sword.\n\nNone of that stopped me from lying my little ass off as a small child \/\npreteen. I'm still not sure why I did it. It was mostly exaggerations and\ntall tails in the way that toddlers do when they start testing boundaries.\nIt doesn't matter why, though.\n\nThat's not the thing I'm trying to get off my chest. I want to talk \nabout the last time my dad lied to me. He's been dead for about 14 years; it was one of our final interactions. \n\nHe was in late-stage cancer that had spread to his brain and was positively loopy from all the meds they had him. He had trouble stringing thoughts together outside of increasingly rare moments. It was hard because he was always the quasi-genius of the family. He was hard-working, good with his hands, and even better with computers.\n\nAs a preteen, he was still perfect in my eyes. It was so, so hard watching\nhim go out like that. I was old enough to realize that he'd miss most of my\nlife. He'd miss the graduations, the promotions, the marriage(s), and all the rest. He was a superhero, and I desperately wanted to make him proud.\n\nAnd like the average preteen, blissfully unaware of themselves and the true complexity of others, I got it in my head that I'd lie to him so I could have a 'true' moment of him being proud of me. It was dumb and short-sighted, but that's how it is.\n\nSo, while hanging out with him on his deathbed, I pulled up a youtube video, one of the stick figure animations that were super popular in the mid-00s. It was well made and complex and had some absurd view count. At the time, I was also dabbling in animation. I thought it was plausible that *I* could've been the one to make it, especially from the perspective of my drugged-up father. \n\nIt was not something I could've made myself in the time frame I claimed. There was a flash of not-pride over his face. For a split second, I saw it, but I didn't know what it was, so I ignored it. Then \"it\" turned into a smile and as much praise as I had hoped. For a long time, it was an anchoring memory for me. 'Knowing' my dad was proud of me, like, *really* proud of me, got me through low points in the coming years, even if it was a lie.\n\nIt wasn't until this morning that the memory resurfaced suddenly in the shower. I've been bawling my eyes out since then. There's no way I could tell anyone I know about this for obvious reasons, but I got to get it on the outside of me else I might explode.\n\nI realize what that look was is now. My dad knew I was lying straight to his face as he was at death's door, but he also instantly knew *why* I lied. He lied straight back to me as if to say: 'It's okay. I'm already plenty proud of you.'\n\nAll these years, and I'm just catching up to the bastard. I wish I could see him again, talk to him as an adult, find out he wasn't perfect, and have an honest relationship with him.   \n\nPlease, *please*, if your parents are still in your life, hug them today and tell them you love them. They aren't around forever; it might be one of the last times you get with them.","upvote_ratio":0.92,"created_utc":1678625779.0},{"title":"I\u2019m really disappointed in my brother","author":"swimlikeaduck","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TrueOffMyChest\/comments\/11prexr\/im_really_disappointed_in_my_brother\/","text":"This is a vent, there\u2019s a bit of backstory. Bear with me. \n\nMy brother Joe married his wife Kate about 5\/6 years ago after being with her for 2\/3 years. At first she was lovely and we\u2019d all hang out as a family but after a period of time they\u2019d come round less, and they\u2019d make odd remarks and only maybe stay an hour on big family events. \n\nKate worked for the family business under my dad as the owner for about 2 years at the beginning of their marriage. He was (in my opinion) a fair boss as she really took the piss with illness, she ended up having 1\/3 of the year off due to illnesses. \nAnother of my brothers Kyle, got married in their third year of marriage, and as expected Joe was his best man. About 1 month prior to the wedding, which my dad was paying for, I got phone calls saying my dad was no longer invited to the wedding because he had tried to \u2018have an affair with Kate\u2019. I spoke to my dad who categorically denied it, but nevertheless I never voiced my opinion due to not wanting to upset both sides. My dad was upset with Kyle for uninviting him as it wasn\u2019t true and he was still expected to pay for the wedding. Joe gave Kyle the ultimatum of \u2018dad or me\u2019 at your wedding. \nIt turns out Kate was actually having an affair with one of my dads staff, which is what she was doing on her sick days (I should say who she was doing) and my brother Joe found out something was going on and rather than coming clean to Joe she blamed it all on my dad and came up with the lie so Joe wouldn\u2019t look into the situation any further.

For privacy purposes I will keep everyone's names to the initial only so we will call her A. \n\nFor starters, I want to say that she has been my best friend since 2016 and don't get me wrong, I love her to death. We are both very different especially with styles of clothing and height but we are both there for each other and we bond like no other. She has been there for me and I have been there for her.\n\n\nWith that out of the way though....lately I have been jealous of her. I don't know why but it's been increasing for months now after she got married in November of last year. She is this short girl with short curly ginger hair. She dresses in mostly pink and has a round soft face. Naturally, she draws so much attention from others. Her husband A (24m) loves her to death and always hypes her up. Everyone at the Young Sdult study I go to are always eager to talk to them and hear all about their stories as a couple.  She gets compliments and gets called cute often. \n\n\nAnd then there's me. I am tall and O have put on some weight. I wear black and I love the gothic style. I have long black hair and my features are a bit more sharp and defined than hers. ( I am partially Native American so I do have some Native features). Naturally, I always look very intimidating. Sure people do talk to me but I can tell they try to avoid me at the same time. I don't get as many compliments as her and there are people at the Young Adult study I go to that do ignore me. Last night when my best friend and her husband were talking to this one couple, that couple kept on talking to them and did everything they could to not include me in. I even tried to tell my bestie this bur kept reassuring me to not worry about it.\n\n\nBut the thing is....I cannot but be jealous and envious. I don't want to be but it's so hard when she is so small and cute. Guys love girls like her and I feel like I'll never be cute as a tall goth girl. I do dress Ina girly goth fashion but I still get left out. I want to be short like her sometimes. I want a guy to like me but I feel like I will never be good enough for them.

I will always love her, so please do not talk down on her.\n\ni (19f) am the oldest daughter, and for anonymity reasons, i will be changing names. I have multiple younger siblings, but this is mostly about my (15f) sister, A. For a bit of background, we all have different fathers (please do not judge my mother). I was born when my mother was 17, and my bio father left before i was born. I have never had any sort of contact with him (even though i have tried to contact him) and he is basically a ghost. A's bio dad \"adopted\" me and basically took me in as his own daughter. He abused my mother horribly and isolated her. She got out a long time ago, but they are still in contact due to A and I. I will call A's dad F.\n\nF went on to abuse me, it was never really physical, except for the few times he grabbed me by the face or shove me because i wasn't walking fast enough. It was mostly emotional abuse. If i didn't wash his dishes after i got home from work, he would threaten to punch me and A, and he would call me ungrateful. He would pick at me until i reacted and then i would be grounded. I didn't have a phone until grade 10, but it was taken away for a year at a time. F used to kick me out of his car for getting snow on his car mat in the middle of winter, and where i live it is always -20 Celsius in the winter.  He is a major narcissist who also happened to be a born-again christian. I was 13 when i came out to him as bisexual, and he told me i was going to burn in hell. I could go on about the things he did to me, but then i would have to write a novel. \n\nMy mother was not the greatest to me growing up, but she has since apologized and we have a great relationship. She is much better with my younger siblings, and that is all i could ever ask for. A is just like F. She screams at my 4 year old sister, she cries when she is told to clean her room, she rants to friends about how terrible her family is, and she picks at people until they react and then she cries and plays the victim. She grunts like a dog whenever she is told to something she does not want to do. She throws huge temper tantrums and jumps up and down and slams doors. My mother tries to be patient with her, but A is just too much to handle. She recently made fun of me for crying because of a cat that was run over. We had seen this as children and she brought it up for no reason. She stated it was funny that the cat had been run over, and when i told her that laughing at it was gross, she kept going. I told her to not expect empathy for others, when she does not feel it herself. She instantly started tearing up and trying to tell on me to my mother (even though i am quite literally an adult and my mom had heard the entire conversation) and when my mom told her to knock it off, she lost it.\n\ni love her, she's my little sister, but being around someone who is just like F is horrible. F traumatized me and made it hard for me to actually trust men. F almost killed my mother, and he drove me to harming myself. He once told me that he was going to tell my therapist that everything i said was bullshit. He got married to a woman he had known for 3 months, and then when she started to not like me, he blocked me. Then when they got divorced, he suddenly wanted me in his life again. I stupidly gave him another chance, which was a major mistake. I currently have him blocked for telling me that i always act like a victim and that i always make him seem like the bad guy.\n\nanyway, im scared my sister will turn out just like him, and i don't know what to do. i just needed to rant about this honestly. i would love to say that i am healing, but im not. thank you for listening.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678649726.0},{"title":"People are mad because I am happy","author":"RecommendationOk8793","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TrueOffMyChest\/comments\/11pw7dc\/people_are_mad_because_i_am_happy\/","text":"So I 20M, got some good luck in my life and people who I have thought of as friends couldn't be madder.\n\nFirst let me give you a bit of context, my ex 20F left me on December 2nd last year, or a bit over 3 months, few days later she posted that she is in a relationship with the guy she said was just a online friend she played games with and she would never do anything with him as he is in fact 30. I broke down after that, I knew one of the reasons she left me was because my life is a mess and I was working on fixing it, few reasons she brought up while breaking up with me were, I was jobless college dropout with no friends and a broken home life. Which is understandable and I was ok with that, but I was not ok with her broadcasting our breakup call to her friends and after that I have decided to change. 2 months ago I was still a bit broken but I got a call from one of said friends of hers, who came out and said she was sorry for listening in that call and how she felt bad and that she can't hold anything in anymore and sent me a audio recording of my ex saying she was with me only because she was bored and that she has had a crush on this guy for our whole relationship (more than a year) which again sent me even deeper down but still I was a bit happy that she did send me this and she felt bad about it. We kept in touch and one thing led to another we slept together a few times, same went with some of their classmates. No I am not proud of this and this was done at the lowest point of my life yet. I ended those situationships early so they don't develop in something serious as I was not in a good place mentally.\n\nNow 2 weeks ago my life long friend came to visit and we started talking more again as we were both single again and it's not that weird for us to hang out more. Yes when we are in relationships both her and I tend to lower our contact just so our partners don't get the wrong idea. We never saw each other in that light but still life is weird and we went on couple of dates and 3 days ago decided to to make it official. We didn't go around yelling that we are together but some of the people me and my ex were friends decided that I was always in love with my best friend and that my ex was just a play thing to me, they started harrasing me and calling my job and saying how awful of a person I am and how I never loved my ex, I just blocked them, my ex came out and apologized to me for what they were saying as they were mostly people I met trough her.\n\nBut yeah they also started to badmouth me because I got my job trough some strings that I had to pull, it's hard out here I might have stolen it from someone but still I don't care that much about that. I was also told how I continued on too fast and how I am not supposed to get better that soon. Yes those are exact words used by few people I knew.\n\nToday I am 50 followers shorter, but still those are just those who I should have cut off along time ago, the part about me sleeping with my exs friend well now ex friend and some of her classmates is there just because I had to say it to someone I will take that to the grave and those girls too or until they get pissed off at my ex and use it as ammunition. I never meant to hurt anyone and I feel bad for that, I will not make excuses I did it because I felt like it and I wanted to spite my ex, I thought I was better than that but still it happeneds to the best of us.\n\nMy point with this is I am in a place and time in my life where I have taken care of most of my problems, only thing that is left is my family and I will take my older half brothers route and cut them off, it sounds harsh but the abuse towards me and favoritism towards my younger brother was and still is unbearable.\n\nTLDR: I got dumped, got my revenge, got my life together and left everything behind that was causing me any hardship.

She was rly upset about it and she seemed rly into him. Fast forward maybe like a few weeks after i matched w him on a dating app (me and the ex) but I didn\u2019t know it was him. That was until she sent some pics of them together and I realized they were the same person. I told her and showed her his profile and she just seemed rly lighthearted like \u2018haha, it\u2019s not my business anymore so he can do what he wants\u2019 vibes so I thought it wasn\u2019t that deep.

To be completely honest I never had intentions to go on a date with him or pursue anything in that direction but I think I just liked the male attention. Anyway I texted her a few days later asking if she was okay and saying how I felt guilty and I never had those intentions. She responded that I will never find anyone loyal if I do this, she can\u2019t be friends with me and her and her friends would never talk to an ex like that. I think her concerns were totally valid and apologized and gave her her space. I literally feel so terrible because I\u2019m usually not this type of person but I\u2019ve had a lot of issues with relationships, attachment problems, SA and male validation which I think I why I continued to talk to him without thinking deeply about it.

I've lived here for just over a year and there are some things I have observed that I can't look past anymore. I come from a culture where respecting parents and elders is absolutely imperative. My aunty and uncle were born in the Gen X\/millennial fringe, so just somewhere in the middle. They are considerably more open minded than others i.e. like my parents, but the idea of respect is still something they value. In my head it's toxic because you can't really say anything and that leads me to the crux of the matter.\n\nMy aunty and uncle have a thing about weight. They've worked hard to reduce their weight over the years and have changed their lifestyle and diet. They also put these ideas on my cousin that she has to be skinny. She's not but she's not by any means \"fat\". They tell her things like she's going to be like [insert name of person they all think is objectively overweight] or she's going to be bullied or eat herself to death. I need to add that whilst they stress a healthy lifestyle they still allow for treats or whatever she wants to eat as long as she does so in moderation. Unfortunately, this is something she doesn't do. I think she can't control herself  with this and it's been a cause for a LOT of screaming matches. This has also bred her to start sneaking around to eat. Locks are going on doors and constant telling offs and punishments are being had. \n\nMy aunty and uncle care but I personally think the way they are going about it is creating a perpetual cycle, causing her to do it more. Her relationship with food is bad. She wants it but she knows she'll get in trouble but I don't think she's managed to distinguish the fact that the trouble only comes when she eats too much. She's a teenager, she's learning but what I heard today made me realise it's gotten worse.\n\nA couple months ago, I could hear throwing up in the bathroom and thought nothing of it since I never heard it before and my room is beside the bathroom so I hear most things in there. Note, only the two of us, my cousin and I, use this particular bathroom, so I know it's her. Today, I heard throwing up again and it went on for a long time. This made me very concerned as we had just bought some takeout which she loves. I don't want to assume anything as this is the second time I've heard throwing up but I don't want to leave it alone. \n\nI fear she is forcing herself to throw up. I don't even know how to approach her with something this sensitive. Im so scared that if she is doing this, she's going to kill herself one day. So how do I do this? What do I say? How do I bring it up in a flow of normal conversation? How do I tell my aunty and uncle this? Honestly, part of me really really doesn't want to tell them. There's a certain trait in a lot of older people in my culture where they do not understand feelings and emotions and trauma and so on. They think it's silly, for lack of a better word. An example is when my aunty brought up a conversation my cousin had with her school counselor where she expressed her bad relationship with food. She basically told her it's her fault and she should fix it if that's how she feels. It was so insensitive but I feared saying anything due to the whole respect thing.\n\nEveryone plays a part in this and everyone needs to work to better this but I really don't know where to start. Sorry for the long post but I really wanted to make sure to put as much detail to understand the full picture.\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated, thank you.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678641220.0},{"title":"I lost all my friends and most of my family.","author":"Flat_Confusion7177","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TrueOffMyChest\/comments\/11pm3b0\/i_lost_all_my_friends_and_most_of_my_family\/","text":"19M\nI\u2019ve been raised as a Jehovah\u2019s Witness by a narcissistic mother and a stepfather. \nIt wasn\u2019t the best to put it simply.

He only did this to the females and all of us were underaged (fast food place). What I heard from my other female coworkers he would go up behind them and lightly tug their hair. \n\nNow this was only when he interacted with us, most of the time he got paid to sit on his butt. He stayed in the office most of the day or left and went down to the liquor store. I cant count how many times we needed help from the manager only to find he wasnt in the building anymore he was at the liquor store or smoking weed. He often came back in smelling like pot. \n\nThere was one time it was just My coworker(i'll call her Emma), my manager, and I working. The place was closed so Emma and I started with end of night cleaning. The manager(Steve) said he was going to step out a bit which isnt unusual he does it all the time. Im cleaning front when I realize Steves car is no longer in the parking lot. He had left two teenagers alone in the building with no supervision and left completely. Emma and I didnt know what to do. We just continued cleaning and hoped he'd come back. He did and said he had gone home to relax for a little before finishing up.\n\nTwo days before I had offically quit, if I wasnt already quitting(waiting for the end of the 2 weeks) I would have quit right on the spot after what my manager did. I am an artist so sometimes i'll bring my sketchbook with me and doodle on break. Which is another thing, Steve almost never gave us our breaks. When we did get a break it was only 10 minutes. Back to before, I was showing one of my coworkers a base of a character I was creating, asking for advice. When Steve takes my sketchbook out of my hands and starts looking through it. It was a relatively new sketchbook but still had a good 20 or so pages filled out. My manager was a tall guy maybe 6\u20195 im only 5\u20195. He refused to give my sketchbook back so the only option I could think of to maintain at least some privacy was to knock it out of his hands. This caused the spine of the sketchbook to break and covers fall off. I\u2019m glad I quit 2 days later.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678653493.0},{"title":"He\u2019s hungry and always on the hunt for new game!","author":"Top-Engine-6737","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TrueOffMyChest\/comments\/11pur27\/hes_hungry_and_always_on_the_hunt_for_new_game\/","text":"He\u2019s a psychopath undiagnosed literally, who lives for sex\/porn, a compulsive liar, coward, 2 faced, back stabbing, spoiled mommies boy.

I have 3 roommates, they all have dogs. I have 2 cats. Cats have to stay in my room; which is fine, most of their dogs are in their rooms most of the time anyways. I sound like a dick for keeping them in my room, but they were to be put down if I didn't adopt them; they imprinted on me when they were strays and are terrified of other people. They lived in a foster home for almost a year with no luck of getting them to ever be comfortable around a person and I write them with one of them sitting directly behind me on the corner of the bed and another on my lap. Sorry that was long winded; I wouldn't have gotten the cats and lived in college housing had they not been in jeopardy of being put down.\n\nAnyways, my room mates' dogs are all huge. It's fine, but they don't train them or do anything to have them have manners. For example, today one came in and immediately unleashed his dog. The dog smelled that I was cooking, jumped, burned himself on the stove. Then the dog jumped on me and scratched the fuck out of my leg. I nudged him away and he started barking super loud at me and the room mate was just like \"lol she's hungry.\" Like train your dog. I have no issues with dogs and grew up around dogs. I got attacked by a pitbull and I still don't really have a problem being around pitbulls. It is what it is, if you're dog is well trained he's fine.\n\nMy Gbig's girlfriend had a dog that when she got it was SUPER well trained. Like wouldn't jump on furniture, knew how to tell you she wanted to play, etc. Like to the point where the dog was basically communicating with us. After just a few months all of that shit went out the window.\n\nAlmost every dog I've met owned by a college student has been some type of neglected that just puts the responsibility of dealing with it on everyone else around the dog and it's so frustrating. If you're like 18\/19 and thinking of getting a large dog, just think about the power that that dog has. If you're not going to take time to train it \/ make sure it's comfortable and happy then don't get the dog. It sucks sometimes, because sometimes it comes down to simply not having time to do that, and that just means you're not at a point in your life where you can own a dog. Maybe your living situation doesn't necessitate having a dog. For example, one of the dogs when it stands up is literally a foot shorter than me and lives in a tiny room. That's miserable.\n\nI don't mean to sound entitled when it comes to my cats; I have two so that they are well entertained and create enough hiding spots intentionally in my room so that they can hide \/ play with eachother.

I was like what the hell what does she mean \"too\"? then when I read my gf's message it was \"Mark is a very good guy, I'll probably marry him at the end, yesterday he told me he loves me and I felt it's sincere\".\n\nI was fucking furious, checked the vocal before it and my gf is saying \"I met Mark yesterday and he's really sick\".\n\nThen I searched now for \"Mark\" again, she mentioned his name twice, the one above and another one, when she was asking a friend to send her Mark's number (forgot to mention I deleted his number from her phone once, when she blocked him).\n\nI was very mad and sad and confused at the same time, I lost the message (her asking for the phone number), so I searched again for the dude's name, well guess the plot twist? now there are three occurrences not two. SHE JUST WROTE HIS NAME AT THAT MOMENT, and to who? TO FUCKING LISA, LISA isn't actually Lisa, it's Mark, and \"My Butterfly\" is the real Lisa. \n\nI'm so upset and don't know how to react tbh. I'm just thinking about what to do now, I didn't tell her what I found out yet btw. I'm thinking about just starting to ignore her, maybe tell her to come for a date then I tell her everything.

I currently work at KFC in UK. I am a female, 4ft 8inches tall. I have worked at KFC for 3 weeks now. I have a new manager, she is aware of my height as everyone else is. Some of my colleagues are not being very nice about my height, making comments. I have been put on window 1 [drive thru window] where you basically stand there when a customer comes and takes an order and that's all. Without even trying other things [like making burgers, packing chicken etc] I was straight away put on window 1, due to me 'being too small for other task' which isn't right. \n\nThis store is short staffed so it means I am more around the burger station, packing and chute area [shelves where you put products like mighty bucket and popcorn] etc. And some of the colleagues do not like it. Yes, I may have a problem putting things on the top shelf at the chute, and reaching to get the fries. But all I have to do ask another member of staff to help me, that shouldn't be a problem at all. But some do not like to help me. I ask the member of staff who is at the chute to put the bags of products on the 2nd or bottom shelf so I can reach [shouldn't be a problem]. I asked the Team Leader on shift that day to put them on other 2 shelf but he didn't take any notice of me. \n\nOne of my colleagues then made comment whilst I'm on the front counter packing, helping out. He said 'that's why she's always put on window 1 taking orders, because she can't do fuck all'. The point I'm getting at is that all of the staff even team leaders and manager have put me on window 1 without thinking of me doing other jobs. They should give me a chance and not discriminate against me because of my height. I had a previous team leader even stop me from doing a job I am fully capable of doing. I have had people push me to the side, grab things out of my hand [whilst I was bagging chicken] for orders and told me to 'go and do whatever you were doing'.\n\nI feel very upset about all of this, I don't feel part of the team. Or if I said anything to possibly make a change, nothing would be done about it. I am actively looking for another job, but I do love the job itself, I just don't want to go to work to be bullied and discriminated against because of something I cannot control. Should I report this to the head office? I am only staying there because of the current living crisis and I need the money. \n\nThank-you for reading.

I'm a future biologist and im completly LOST.","author":"TOMYCAT97","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TrueOffMyChest\/comments\/11plb0s\/i_need_help_with_my_future_path_im_a_future\/","text":" Hello all. I'm an Argentinian 25 y.o guy who is completly lost about the future. I gonna divide the post in different parts so it's more organized. I would REALLY appreciate if you read the post and use your time to answer with your opinion\/ideas\/whatever come to your mind.\n\n1. BACKGROUND\n\nI study a \"licenciatura\" in biological sciences in Argentina. It is a career that is considered as \"bachelor's degree + master's degree\" abroad. I have been studying it for 7 years and I will graduate in approximately 4 months. Did it take me a long time to complete it? Completly. But the reality is that in Argentina the biology degree is much longer and also has the disadvantage that the degree is not oriented to a certain branch in particular as it happens with the masters. Most of my cohort has not graduted it yet \/ some are doing it these days \/ others will take longer than me. I'm going to graduate with quite decent grades, having done 1 volunteering, 3 internships, teaching practices, and some courses. I don't think I've really acquired tools that are in demand with internships\/etc anyway. I am currently finishing my degree thesis in the area of \u200b\u200bmarine ecology, and my idea is to publish the thesis when I finish. I know how to speak\/write English decently although I lack practice. During my career I realized that I like practically everything, when I get interested and learn it I end up liking it. But the downside is that I'm not passionate about anything. Neither in marine ecology, nor in microbiology, nor in molecular biology, nor in anything (what I like the least is actually molecular biology). The good part is that i really like science. Not only as a career path but also as a way of thinking. My profile is currently more oriented towards what is research in marine ecology (both because of the internships I did, as well as because of a scholarship that I have for research in marine sciences, and because of the thesis that I am currently doing). But I am willing to change course because I'm not sure on pursuing a research career.\n\nI would like to try my luck in Europe (I also have Italian citizenship).\n\n2) OPTIONS ABOUT FUTURE PATH\n\nI have 3 options here (in order of priority): a) apply for an Erasmus+ scholarship (for that I have to take the IELTS) and spend two years in Europe doing a Master. Pros: maybe I can get contacts\/language experience or living abroad\/I wouldn't stay away from academia in case I eventually want to go back to Argentina and pursue a PhD. Option b) Go to work in Europe for 1 year in things that have nothing to do with my career. Advantages = I would get money\/experience in languages \u200b\u200band living abroad that might help me try to find a job from what I studied at the same time. Disadvantages: I need to raise a LOT of money in Argentina (at least 6 months of work because I need to prove funds to leave). In addition, I would not have as much continuity with my academic profile. c) Look for a job as a biologist in Argentina (or remote, although it would be difficult to find) and raise money. I don't know what I would do with my life afterwards. This is the least feasible option I see. I would like to stay with option a) and failing that, b). The issue is that since I don't know what I want to dedicate myself to\/or the availability of jobs abroad, it's hard for me to choose the master's program. I liked the remote sensing\/gis part a bit but I have practically no experience of that at university. I was just interested. It could be something related to marine ecology, although I see it as very research oriented. Or perhaps microbiology, idk. Perhaps the best option for my profile is to look for a master's degree that will give me the tools for tomorrow to be able to work in industry, consulting, or research. Perhaps something related to statistics\/big data? But I don't have a good level in statistics either and I think it would be more accessible for me to enter in ecology programs (although maybe I don't want to because I don't know if they would give me the tools I need for the future!) Age is a factor that worries me too. Taking a master's degree at 26 means finishing at 28 without work experience in the field. Here in Argentina it is relatively common. But it scares me because I know that in other countries it works differently and there is other competition. I'm afraid I won't be able to land a job of what i have studied.\n\n3) FINAL CONCLUSIONS\n\nI don't even know what response I hope to get from all this I wrote. But I wanted to get it off my chest. Any advice\/opinion will be greatly appreciated. I would like to find a job that I like one day and to earn enough money to live nice, just that. Also, I would like to one day transition to remote work as well, to be able to work in different countries. I don't know how viable it is. I'm lost.\n\nTL;DR: I need help choosing my path as a biologist. I feel a bit behind and want to choose a path that will give me some kind of stability in the future. Although perhaps stability is an illusion, idk. I would like to live in Europe for a while to test myself.

I've only had one relationship, but in our entire time together, we never actually *fought* once.  We disagreed, of course, but know what we didn't do?

We talk for a bit and I end up catching feelings. She has a master's degree and was more than capable of having an intellectual conversation on top of just being really sweet. We had been talking pretty much all day every day from October to January. She would write me all these long messages complimenting me and praising me and all kinds of other stuff. I told my therapist about that and she and I both thought that this woman liked me romantically. This past December, the conversations started slowing down and I felt like my window of opportunity was closing so I told her I liked her and wanted to meet up IRL. She then says that we are two vastly different people with little in common and that we weren't compatible (I felt the opposite tbh).\n\nNow that I knew that our interaction was not going to go anywhere, I lost interest in talking with her. I told her this, but I prefaced it with \"we can still be friends and have an amicable relationship.\" She then says it's best for both of us if we just stop talking and I never hear from her again (she also expressed that she started talking to her ex again too). I haven't heard from her in two months and the wounds are still fresh. Right now, I feel anger, heartache, frustration, and all kinds of other things. I have no other place to let these feelings out because there is a lot of personal family drama going on involving my parents so I can't go to them. I also don't want to annoy my friends about it. Frankly, I don't even want to post this on Reddit because I'm expecting a storm of comments from people implying (or plainly saying) that I have no right to be upset about this situation. I have nowhere else to let this out. It embarrasses me that I'm so torn up about someone I've never met IRL. A few weeks ago, I wrote her a message telling her I missed her and how much she meant to me (of course she doesn't respond...). Honestly, a part of me feels extremely angry at her for what happened because she has been able to go on as if nothing happened and I'm the one who has to live with the pain. On top of this, the frustration at not having been able to meet someone else just morphs into rage and exacerbates the shitty feelings.\n\nRight now, I'm in a life situation that's not conducive to meeting women (I'm taking steps to address this, but it will take a while). Also, I've just had very shitty luck with women in general. I have enough self-awareness to know that my low self esteem that I've had for most of my life has contributed to that too. Currently, I have the best relationship with myself that I've ever had (even in spite of this). I can honestly say that I love myself and I've accomplished a lot of things worthy of being proud of. Still, every single time I meet someone things end up falling apart. I've tried dating apps, posting on various subs (and my posts get downvoted, which makes me even more angry and frustrated), trying to talk to women IRL, etc and still keep coming up short. I still miss this woman so much. I didn't care if she was 2 hours away; I would have made it work just for her. Every day, I looked forward to talking to her. I still cry when I think about her. I fantasized about finally meeting her IRL and us going on adventures together, but all of that will remain a fantasy. Believe it or not, throughout my entire communication with this woman I didn't have a single sexual thought about her. I loved who she was as a person so much more.\n\nI don't expect a partner to make my life perfect. Honestly, I just want the kind of relationship my dad and stepmom had before she passed. They used to work on cars together and go to shows and watch movies together and always playfully teased each other. Honestly, I don't think they had a single argument the entire 10 years they were together (none that I knew of, anyway). I love you and I miss you even if you don't feel the same toward me. I wish we could have met IRL and I miss waking up to your \"good morning\" texts and I wish every day that you were back in my life.","upvote_ratio":0.82,"created_utc":1678622212.0},{"title":"My sister told me I was unlikeable and it still haunts me years later","author":"SevereAir9768","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TrueOffMyChest\/comments\/11pqnxh\/my_sister_told_me_i_was_unlikeable_and_it_still\/","text":"Hi!

People will tell me 'he had a good run'. The paramedic who came today was one of the first I've heard to try and reassure my dad that he's 'still young enough to help', for all the good it did.\n\nHe's not perfect. He has flaws, has made some choices that still impact me to this day. He himself has expressed how guilty he feels for a lot of it. He never realised until I was grown just how much his choices impacted me, and he's one of the few people I've ever met who I can truly say has worked to change for the better. He inspires me to believe better of people, that they're capable of improving and *wanting* to improve.\n\nHe's been the parent who always showed up for me. There were times he was both mum *and* dad. My mum had to be sectioned in a psychiatric facility for long terms and, even when stabilised, could be very selfish and unsupportive. I couldn't lean on her for advice or count on her to have an emotional connection. But I can - could? - always count on him.\n\nWe only really got close when I was in my early 20s. Before that there were so many things that got in the way. But when we finally clicked, we really clicked. I can't put into words how important he is to me and how much I love him.\n\nHe showed some signs of struggle three years ago but seemed to improve with diet and lifestyle changes. Then, last year, things started going wrong.\n\nThe big problem is that he has no trust in the medical profession. He experienced multiple instances of malpractice. A dentist who did unnecessary work that caused him issues, hospital staff that killed a close relative through neglect, more staff that made a relative an amputee as a result of a careless mistake during a surgery and they later lost their life due to infection. It made him resolved to never see a doctor or go to a hospital again. He told us that he wanted no ambulances called for him, and that he'd refuse help. He made it clear that we should never let an ambulance take him when he had no capacity to choose for himself.\n\nSo here we are. He's spent from July last year until now trying home remedies and online advice. I'm just as bad. Because he wouldn't seek actual diagnoses, I would have to ask questions in forums of people with similar sounding conditions for advice. Knowing he would never seek help or treatment from professionals, I did my best to do a bodge job in his health. And - of course, of course - I failed.\n\nI don't think the home diagnoses he made were ever right. I'm not sure any of my attempts to find him diet changes made a difference.\n\nHis ability to eat tapered off until he was on liquids in December. He's been able to intermittently eat solids since then, but never quite enough. His weight has plummeted. I didn't realise how much until I saw him laid out on the floor, paramedics trying to bring him to consciousness - his legs are skeletal, his shoulders are skeletal. His wrists are so tiny that even my small hands\/fingers could probably encircle them fully. They never could before. His trunk is what tricked me - he still looks broad and healthy in the chest and belly.\n\nHe kept getting obstructions that prevented him from eating solids. He'd take a laxative, but it would make him weaker and weaker.\n\nHis breathing became so bad two days ago that he can't make it from his bed to the nearby bathroom. Today, it's so bad that he collapsed on the way back to bed. He got lodged between the bed and the chest he keeps nearby, face-down on the night stand. He was making such terrible noises.\n\nHe made me promise to never call an ambulance, but I did it anyway. The operator was instructing me to try and get him flat on his back. By some insane feat of strength I moved the impossibly heavy chest away, but couldn't move him onto his back by myself. I got him flat by pulling on his legs, but he hit his face on the way down.\n\nThe paramedics came as quickly as they could. Gave him oxygen, checked his vitals. Oxygen down, heart rate up, blood sugars high. He looked at me with such anger and disgust when he regained consciousness and realised I had called them.\n\nThey made it clear. Hospital, or death - any time from now to a few days. They wouldn't even guess what was wrong but said it's very serious. Dad, being dad, refused help. No matter what my mum or I said, he refused.\n\nThe paramedics said that if he falls unconscious and doesn't regain capacity, they can take him and treat him anyway. But he would never forgive us for that - it would be against his wishes. It feels like an impossible choice. I want to be greedy and selfish and get more years with him, if possible. But it would be at the cost of his love and his respect. I would be denying his most sincere wishes for my own comfort. And given that now, hours later, he's showing signs of either heart attack or stroke (but is still conscious enough to reject treatment) I'm not sure he'd be in any condition to survive even if I disrespected his wishes. \n\nI hate that I'm in this position. I hate that I feel resentment for being put in this position. He's barely accepting water right now. He's probably not going to accept solids. I don't know how to handle the care of him except to ply him with water and see what happens. He still talks as though this is fixable. It's either the confusion that's settled over him or he's probably trying to spare me because I've had anxiety and depression for years.\n\nI don't know what's wrong with me. Losing him is my worst nightmare, it always has been. Now that it's right in front of me, it's a 90% certainty at this point, I feel like I've overloaded. I feel numb, clinical. But also cold and sweaty. I have to put my mum first - she will break after this. They've been together for 55 years.\n\nThis post probably sounds hollow, emotionless. I'm not sure why I'm writing this. Maybe I just want someone to hear me. I have to keep a brave face for my mum. I'll have to notify siblings, even the ones I'm NC with. I have to bear the burden of finding our future because to be honest, I've never had to adult very much and I don't know what I'm doing. I've given money for bills but never been part of the process of paying them. Mum and I can't afford the rent of this house by ourselves. I have no idea how I'll afford to move. So many people to call, so much to arrange, but it's a Sunday so I can't even begin. I know this is my worst nightmare and this will break me too, so why do I feel so numb and clinical?\n\nI'm currently just giving him water and panicking about what to do if he needs to go to the toilet. He won't even make it to the bathroom this time. I'm telling him much I love him, how lucky I am that he's in my life. I'm telling him I'm grateful every day. That I wouldn't change anything, even the painful stuff. I think he's coherent enough to understand what I'm saying. He responds with similar sentiments even though he's not always making sense. He said that he feels guilty about my upbringing, that he's failed as a parent. I've held onto some bitterness and anger over the years but in this moment I just want him to know the unfailing truth which I didn't fully know myself until now: ***I wouldn't change a thing***.\n\nI don't want to cause him more suffering by unleashing my own, so I have to shower him with love and smiles instead. I want to have no regrets about whether or not he doubts just how much he means to me. I know when this finally hits me I'm going to be destroyed. I wish so much he would have sought help, but I'd be lying if I said I didn't know it would be like this. He never hid his feelings.\n\nIf anyone has advice (UK) on how to even begin with preparing for the future I am all ears. Money advice, grants, finding a smaller council place to move to. I just feel so blank. This is going to hit me like an avalanche soon and I'm so lost. Please, no insults of his personal choices. I know his choices are not ideal or sensible. I know his choices are hurting me but he's a real, wonderful person who gave me everything and I'm about to lose him.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678643394.0},{"title":"Cold sore","author":"Hello891011","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TrueOffMyChest\/comments\/11p904b\/cold_sore\/","text":"I\u2019ve had cold sores for what feels like as long as I can remember.

This isn't the type of doctor I want to be, but its part of training. \n\nI was doing a physical for an elementary aged child... and she was the most combative and defiant child (or patient in general) I have dealt with yet. Usually with kids this age, as long as you don't pull out a needle they cooperate. \n\nThe moment I walked in she screamed. I told her no needles today but that didn't seem to work with her. I couldn't shine lights into her eyes, she would bury her face in her mother's chest screaming. She constantly moved her face so I couldn't look into her ears. I couldn't even put the stethescope on her chest, she wouldn't have it. I couldn't even put headphones over her ears to check her hearing. \n\nI asked her if she wanted to listen to my heart first. I put the stethescope in her ears and she listened to my heart. Then she let me listen to hers. I figured it out, if I let her do it to me first she would cooperate. So that's how I did the physical. Unfortunately what's usually less than 20 minutes took about 40 minutes. \n\nI go to report to the attending pediatrician and she is really unhappy with me. She is yelling at me about how long I took. Not a big deal to me,   you get yelled at in this field I got yelled at a lot in the military. You don't make excuses. You just take the ass chewing, apologize, and say it won't happen again. It really doesnt bother me. After I got chewed out I look behind me and my little patient had followed me into the hallway. \n\nShe runs up to me, tightly hugs my legs and says sorry. I'm not sure if this child was sorry I was being yelled at or self aware enough to realize I was being yelled at due of her but it was literally the sweetest thing ever. I take the child back to the treatment room. Finish my case presentation. Mom and attending talk as I pull the child out and find a ball to play catch with in the hallway. She asks me if I'm in trouble and I assured her I wasn't in trouble. She feels better and I give her an underhand toss. She beams the ball at me \ud83d\ude05. I see im dealing with a future ball pitcher. \n\nAfter I waved her and her mother goodbye, it dawned on me that this child actually was trying to comfort me. When you're a grown man, people don't generally do that for you anymore. I had to drink a bunch of water to keep it all together.

You have completely possesed me and I was obsessed. I loved you and hated you for that. \n\nI don't know if you ever gave a shit about me, or if you liked the attention and empathy I showed you and that I admired you so much. You narcisist! You don't need anybody to tell you how great or beautiful you are. You know that!\n\nI wanted to be like that too. \n\nI know I made you feel good too, but you never admitted that. You were ungreatful, self centered, vile. But it's not you. It's a reflection of you past, we both shared similar trauma. We both understood how it was to be neglected, abused and growing up in a toxic society. It just affected us in a different way. \n\nYou made me feel present, and that I was living in the moment when you were next to me. I was alive and happy, you were like a drug. I felt so completely empty each time we said goodbyes. I hated that. \n\nThe feelings I had for you were so unhealthy and I was aware of this. I didn't want to be addicted to another person. \n\nI told you I started going to therapy, I never told you the reason. The reason was you.\n\nI started reading more books on self improvement. Because of you. \n\nI started to meditate to clear my head, because of you. I needed to occupy my mind, I started new hobbies. I had to change! You made me do it. And for that I am so grateful! Ironically I became a better person because of you. I will forever be grateful to you.\n\nBut.. it still wasn't enough, despite months of self improvement, I knew only time would be the best healer. 3 months has gone since the first day I met you. I am better. \n\nI told you that I am learning a lot, just from being in your presence. Only thing I wish is that you could tell me that you got something from me too, but you never said anything like that. I don't mind, but it still hurts. \n\nI was just a cry on the shoulder when your boyfriend hurt you. I couldn't be just that. It wasn't fair to him and it wasn't fair to me. I wanted everything or nothing. It was nothing. \n\nI knew you were in a relationship yet I kept pushing and hoping for something more. I broke your trust, you didn't deserve it. I am sorry. I was completely obsessed with you, I know it is not an excuse, but it is all I got. \n\nI am relieved, it's over. I just wish I could repay you even more. You were acting flirty, I got too carried away and everything ended so abruptly. I said I wanted only friendship but it was never possible, not here. \n\nBut I guess this is how it was supposed to be. Nothing lasts forever. Some people are only there in your life for a short time, to serve some kind of purpose. We both learn something from eachother and then we move on. I learned to be more self dependent and more of an egoist. I needed that.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou will always have a special place in my heard. I loved you from the first moment I noticed your presence. I don't know what it was, it was just there, I think it was in your cold, icy gaze.  \n\nI shed tears, you shed yours. We both knew nothing more could happen, not in this situation, maybe not even in this lifetime.\n\nI believe that I healed and I hope you did as well. I hope you will get well and live a happy and fullfilling life.\n\nYou deserve everything that's good. And despite all the nasty things we said to eachother at the end, my feelings for you have not changed.\n\nI fucking love you and I will as long as my memory will remember you.

The worst part is the feeling better part. The hope that things are getting better and I\u2019m getting better and becoming a better person just kills me in the end. And it makes each period of soul sucking depression longer and the hole gets harder to climb out of. It also makes me hate myself more. The fucking self loathing Jesus Christ. It\u2019s just fuck you this and fuck you that in my head all the time.

But I know it will be for me, I can already tell. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever felt like I\u2019ve belonged anywhere, yet I\u2019ve moved a couple times now with all this hope, and the freshness and glamour wears off in about a month. Then I fantasize about moving to the next place. By now I know it\u2019s just gonna be the same thing over and over. Then what? Get married and have kids? \n\nFirst of all, why? The fucking world is ending it kinda just seems cruel to have children. Plus I already know it\u2019s gonna take awhile for that to happen. Like I said, I\u2019m an asshole. I know that, and I think I justify it by saying I\u2019m just being myself and being honest, but I am often an asshole to people anyways. Then regret it and introspectively punish myself for it. It\u2019s just hard for me these days to imagine someone choosing me. The whole other part of it is hoping for it to change my life or make me happy, when I know I\u2019ll eventually feel the same as with everything else. And then hate myself for feeling that way.\n\nPoint being, I don\u2019t see a path to happiness and that\u2026 just really sucks. All you can do is basically do all these mental gymnastics to make your brain think your happy and then try not to break character. Sure, works for awhile. To some it\u2019s the secret to success or whatever. My brain just doesn\u2019t buy it after awhile.\n\nAnyways, don\u2019t really have anyone to talk about this stuff with. I have friends that are a supportive but there\u2019s a limit to how much you can burden someone and how much they can take. Don\u2019t really give a damn if anyone reads this.

It was kind of sudden and out of nowhere. I asked her to do marriage counseling and she said it\u2019s too late for that and wanted to move forward with the divorce. At first I was kind of broken, but I am pretty good at hiding my emotions, so I showed that I was upset, but not as upset as i really was. I was under the impression for so long that our marriage was fine and yeah, she had some things she was upset about, but I was trying to work on them. I guess not good enough. We never really argued, and I\u2019m the type of person that doesn\u2019t raise my voice or get angry very easily. I\u2019ve never been abusive, drank, did drugs, etc. So none of these are a factor in case you\u2019re wondering. \n\nShe started living in the spare bedroom until she could find a place and move out. After telling my friends and family what was happening, the consensus was that there is something more going on, or there\u2019s someone else. So I checked our phone records and was able to read her text messages to someone else. What I read disgusted me, and I can\u2019t look at her the same. She is on dating apps and talking to multiple other people. When I asked her about it, she denied it at first and then I asked her to stop lying to me because i have the messages to prove what she\u2019s been doing. She then stated that she didn\u2019t start using dating apps until after she asked for for a divorce, which I guess in her mind was fine but to me I found it to be completely disrespectful because she is still living in my house at that point and we\u2019re still technically married. She got even more angry when she learned that I told my family what she did and begged me to tell them that it was a misunderstanding, to which I did not oblige because she did what she did and cannot take that back.\n\nAfter she moved out and she asked me for no contact until I get a court date for our divorce, I started slowly accepting the fact that she\u2019d been planning this for a long time. Over the months, she\u2019d been working out a lot more, working more to save money up and distancing herself from me, which I hadn\u2019t noticed until now. I feel hurt, betrayed and she shows no remorse for what she did. I\u2019m starting to accept what happened and working to better myself every day. All the feelings I had for her are gone because I see now what a treacherous snake she really is. I wish it hadn\u2019t turned out this way, but at the same time, I\u2019m glad it did rather than staying together where she would have probably ended up cheating on me or doing something worse. \n\nWe wanted to keep things amicable regarding the divorce. She keeps her stuff and I keep the house, which was mine before the divorce. I\u2019m thankful that we weren\u2019t married long enough for her to really be entitled to anything of mine, like my retirement. She also makes more money than me, so she can\u2019t come after me for alimony. \n\nThat\u2019s all really. I\u2019m getting back to my old self. Trying to be happy again.

I have a half-sister whom I haven't seen in 16 years, he doesn't know where she is\/how she's doing, nor will he help me find her. I feel ready to give up on everything sometimes. I feel so overwhelmed and unsupported.

Someone pulled a pic from my wife's Instagram and posted it along with the link to my Twitch (which is why Google pulled it up).  My wife has been physically different all her life, people tend to gawk or treat her like she's a child or intellectually disabled.  The comments on the picture were some of the most vile shit.  People suggesting that I take her disability check, take care of her and let the govt pay me to do it, living off the teat.  Others asking how I could possibly be happy being married to someone who looks the way she does.  I know that's what 4Chan is for, but why in the hell do people need to be this way?  I wasn't able to comment as it was just an archive of an old deleted post, and I know feeding the trolls is the worst thing you can do, but I mean...FUCK.

Excuse any errors, English is my second language.\n\nMe (24m) and my boyfriend Shawn (25m) have a friend, Anna, who's not monogamous, I'm not sure if polyamorous is the right term to use, but she maintains sexual relationships with 4 men, and she's much happier then our friends that are in exclusive relationships, though that may be Anna's personality.\nMe and my boyfriend were discussing that one night, and he asked me if I wanted an open relationship since I was speaking so highly of Anna's life style, he wasn't angry or anything, just curious. I asked him if he wanted one, and he said he wasn't opposed to it, so we decided to try it with some rules.\n\nOur rules were:\n\u2022 No sleeping in our bed with other people \n\u2022 Always make the other person aware if a hook up is going to happen\n\u2022 Don't sleep with the same person more than twice unless the other approves \n\u2022 Always come back home after a hook up, no staying overnight \n\u2022 Be safe and responsible \n\u2022 No hooking up with mutual friends \n\nOne of the first people that my boyfriend asked for permission to hook up consistently with was his childhood friend, Sebasti\u00e1n, who I know has had a crush on him since forever. I accepted and approved of Sebasti\u00e1n and in turn my boyfriend approved that I hook up with some of my friends. \nIt worked well for a while, he asked me to approve of two other people later on but mostly had one time things, I had my fun with my approved friends and the occasional one night stand too.\n\nEvery time he came back from a hook up he'd give a lot of attention and asked if I wanted to know what had happened, it turned into some sort of game of him talking about his hook up while we had sex, I enjoyed it and we did sleep together without talking about our hook ups sometimes. When I felt insecure because one of his partners was better looking that me he'd reassure me that he loved me and only me. \n\nIt went on for a few months until Shawn told me he had to be honest with me. He sat me down and told me he had started developing a crush on two of his regular hook ups, Sebasti\u00e1n and a girl named Kira. He told me that he wanted to know how I felt about this and that he will stop seeing them if it makes me uncomfortable. I told him I had to think about it and he offered to arrange a date so I can meet them personally and give him my honest opinion. I accepted.\n\nThat was a week ago, he hasn't seen them since then, and today he told me that they planned a day together ( Shawn, Sebasti\u00e1n and Kira) for tomorrow, and I'm panicking a little.\nI've seen Kira, she's a gorgeous girl on the chubbier side, ginger with stunning blue eyes, and I know how strong the bond between Sebasti\u00e1n and my boyfriend is, I'm afraid that if I tell him I'm okay with him still seeing them he'll realize that he likes them better and dump me. But I don't want to stop my boyfriend from having his fun, since I'm having mine, it feels hypocritical.\n\nI will go on the date and figure out what to tell him afterwards, I've decided that, I'm just a little scared.","upvote_ratio":0.5,"created_utc":1678646274.0},{"title":"I am a bad person who lived a bad life","author":"uhfuhgvujfhdijvf","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TrueOffMyChest\/comments\/11plzxu\/i_am_a_bad_person_who_lived_a_bad_life\/","text":" \n\nhello  \nI am just getting this off my chest.\n\nsome details are fake like ages and years  \nI was born in 1998 I am the first child of my parents we were very poor for 6 years. we lived in a 30 cubic meters house full of scorpions and bugs. we would try to sleep as high as possible from the ground to avoid scorpions. I barely remember that. after the age of 6, my dad opened a restaurant and it worked so we moved to another house which was much better, my dad got in prison when I was 7, and his mother moved in with us, she despised me, she used to hit me, hide my toys, not let me eat snacks, my mother did not care. he got back after 6 months, then I got to school, it was a horrible year i always got bullied and hit by other kids bc I was small compared to them, also my parents used to leave in my aunt's house bc their house is close to school, my cousin who is a male that is 10 years older than me, used to always sexually assault me, touching me with his hand and his private in some places, I used to get sexually assaulted by a female cousin as well who is 9 years older than me, I got sexually assaulted by my dad workers, by a random bricklayer, by people in the street who claimed they are playing with me, when I reached the 5th class in elementary school, older students who failed 3 or 4 years used me sexually to help me from bullies, but they did not, the principle got tired of me reporting many people and he told my dad to move me to a private school and he did, it was perfect for the first week, I was the nominated for the student of the month, i was very clean and smart i always do my homework's, when I said it was great, it was because i finally found a real friend, or so i thought, after a month he started changing, he told me sometimes to stop studying and spend time with him and he made me do things at school like pranks and other things, I never refused a thing because he is the only friend i got in my life, i became a bad student, i didn't study anymore i behaved very bad, and he started to tell me to cut people off which i did bc he was the most important to me, then he started asking for sexual things like kisses and touches, i refused, but he was stronger and forced me to do some, later he started saying if i dont do them by willingly he would leave, I started doing them, then after months he asked for a picture of my butt, he threatned me by saying he will leave me, but it was too much for me and I said no this time and he is not a real friend if he would leave me like that, he said fine then i will unalive myself i cried so much and asked him not to do it, after some hours we agreed that i will send it and he will not save it, he did save it, and started threatening me with it to things, after one year of him using me, he got tired and left me, but he destroyed me, i used to cry everyday literally and i hated myself so so so much, i hated everything about me, i really hated me face and the way i look, this part might seem like a lie but it is not, i never never and i mean never look anyone in the eyes form more than 1 second, a lot of people tried to fix me but they could not, i never posted any pics with my face bc i hated it i never was in any family or friends pic, i don't have pics of my face when i was younger, onetime a classmate suggested that i smoke a cigar and cover my face with the smoke and take a pic, i was only 15, i did it, and he said he will send it to my dad, if my dad saw it, he would kill me, he used for year also, ( damn it looks fake but believe me it is not, i was known in school for being stupid and easy to use, people used to take money and food from me) and then after a year of of being alone, i trained basketball and boxing and i got some trust, i made it in the school team, and I was known to be strong with boxing now because some of my classmates are with me in the boxing club, that really boosted my ego and I started using it, I started bullying people for everything, for the way they look ( even though i hated the way i look) for their weight, and for everything, I did two mistakes that I will forever regret, I harassed my little sister once sexually, and harassed a young female cousin, I really hate myself for it but no one knew about it so I swore to never harass any girl ever, now for my family side, my dad used to beat me from the age of 7 and until 3 months ago, he used to beat me a lot A LOT with a belt with a stick with his hands, I lost consciousness a lot of times due to him beating me too much, my mom used to beat me a lot too, they only showed me love with money, they used to say horrible things to me, how they wish i was never born, how i am a punishment for them, how they wish i was dead, i overheard my dad once saying that beating me up relive his stress, my uncle once threatened to kick me out of the family as soon as my dad dies in front of him, they fought for a month but they came back together, it didnt matter anyway bc my parents did threaten to kick me out and disown me many times, my aunt calls me the dirty human and sometimes Satan, my other aunt said that my presence causes trouble, i was nothing to my dad but an image to how good people think he is as a dad, so i really hate the way I look with a beard so I always shave it, one time a friend of my dad told him that he is a horrible dad for letting me do that, and its not manly, he never allowed me to shave it again, i did shave it once, and he beat me up so bad I spent 3 days just sleeping and crying, in my senior year in high school, i educated myself a lot and improved, I stopped bullying people, i never harassed any woman, i started posting pics of myself, and I started studying nursing, i didn't care to anyone anymore i became so emotionless, and after 3 years in college i found an amazing girl i asked her out and she accepted, after two years of dating, we weren't compatible anymore I told her about it and we said we will work it out after 8 months of trying and going to counseling we just couldn't do anything, we both were not happy so somehow I managed to breakup with the love of my life it was the hardest thing ever, i cried a lot, but what she said to me broke me so hard, she said she never loved me and never cared for me, she started listing a lot of things that she hates about me, my height, my hair, my big nose, that really destroyed me, and now I am here, 23 years male, all alone, no friends, no gf, no love interests, no will to love again, no real family, i have no one to trust, if you read this thing to the end, thank you so much.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678646157.0},{"title":"My friends are faking

since I changed schools about a year ago. He seemed nice, and we both had similar interests, so we became friends very quickly.\n\nA few months ago, he started struggling with tics. I was really cynical and doubted he actually had Tourettes, as he never had them in class, and despite him saying that his parents were helping him get a diagnosis, he did not tic AT ALL at their house when I went there, and they seemed to have no idea that this was happening. I felt like a really bad person for being so cynical, but I'm almost certain he's faking at this point.\n\nAnyway, his tics disappeared as quickly as they came, until we started hanging out with some more of these tics kids. They've suddenly come back, way worse than before, but not when he's just with me (I try to ignore them as best as possible). Suddenly his entire personality was his Tourettes, we had nothing in common anymore because all he talked about was conditions he didn't have. I'm mostly ignored by the entire group because I don't do this.\n\nAnyway, apparently he has DID as well now. He had one alter at the start of the day, by the end of the day he had split about 3 more times. He had no disassociation even though that's literally in the disorder name and now he always gets mad if I refer to him by his name, because it's \"not his name\" or something. Also within FIVE MINUTES of him \"coming out\" with this disorder, 2 other people in the group also claimed to have it.\n\nThey all have \"littles\" and they just run around screaming all break. I have a brother the same age as their younger alters, and kids that age do not act the way they claim at all. \n\nI've been trying my best to avoid the group since all they talk about is DID now and they literally just do glorified roleplay the entire time we hang out. I have nothing in common with any of them and I literally only liked the original friend, I don't like any of the people I've been forced to hang out with to talk to him and I hate how annoying all of this is.\n\nI haven't said anything to anyone's face because I don't really like confronting people, I'm just trying to avoid them. It's actually quite nice being by myself because I don't get jumpscared by fake tics every 5 seconds.\n\nSorry for the long post, if you have any advice I'd appreciate it.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678610987.0},{"title":"December of last year I got scammed at a car dealership","author":"ExplanationDazzling1","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TrueOffMyChest\/comments\/11plr89\/december_of_last_year_i_got_scammed_at_a_car\/","text":"I had just got in an accident with my 2006 Honda Accord car which was paid off. It was my fault my insurance paid for the other persons damages. Because I only had liability my car insurance didn\u2019t pay for me. I felt so horrible about what happened that night. I had no car so I had to catch the train and bus to get back and forth to work. It was 2.5 hr going and 2.5 coming back home. I did this for a month because I felt really bad and I didn\u2019t want to jump back into a car right away. I was still in shock and I wasn\u2019t ready for the expressway. It started to get cold outside so I desperately needed a car. I had 19k saved up in my back account. I went to my mechanic who sells really great cars for cheap. He didn\u2019t have anything on the lot because during the winter time used car sales are bad and the market was going through it. He only had a Mitsubishi lancer with 250k miles on it for $3500. Nope I decided to keep looking. So I had no choice but to purchase a car from a dealership\n\nLong story short i saw an ad on Cargurus for a Mitsubishi going for $18,500. I went to Mitsubishi car dealership the next day and made a very impulsive decision that I regret to this day. I naively went with the first car and signed every paper the finance office gave to me. All I can hear was blah blah blah and gap insurance. I ended up with a $24,998 car loan. I never knew this until the loan was accepted through the finance agency. I was disgusted at what I saw. That price for a 2020 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport! Oh hell no instantly went to the dealership canceled the warranty and gap insurance. Ended up paying $21,504. Still I believe I could\u2019ve got a cheaper price but I say all this to say, I have to learn to be more patient and ask questions. If I was patient I could\u2019ve caught those hidden fees and possibly walked away to find better deals. \n\nI paid the car off within 3 months because I naively accepted a high APR and long monthly term, 84 months.\n\nI need to read more up on personal finance and economics because I am very ignorant when it comes to that. So now that I have a $18,000 car parked out front I can\u2019t wait to sell it and buy a used cheap car from my mechanic. Not only I impulsively bought just a car but I impulsively purchased a car I don\u2019t actually like.\n\nBuilding back up on my finances 3 months later:\n\nI have \n\n$5,000 in the back \n\n$3,400 in my Discover Savings account with a high yield \n\n$1,788 in my 401k\n\n$2334 in my other my bank account I call her ( Rainy Day )\n\nThe plan is to sell the car I have now at at least recoup from the money I lost and look at this like a learned lesson. I may not be able to get all my money back but I\u2019ll get most of it back for sure since the car only has 12k miles on it. It\u2019s practically brand new I just had the power in it.

We went to family therapy, we poured our heart out, we tried everything to reach out to him.\n\nAnd he just doesn't get it.\n\nWhenever we bring up specific situations of abuse, be it emotional or physical, he's always got a myriad of excuses ready and refuses to acknowledge he did anything wrong. His apologies are always empty - they're offered not because he empathizes with our pain, but because we doesn't want us to be angry with him anymore. And that's when he remembers the situations correctly - because most of them left no mark what-so-ever on him, so he can't even recall the timing or circumstances leading up to them.\n\nAnd last session the family therapist said something that made me finally come to a decision. *My father simply does not have the emotional tools to give me what I need to heal \u2013 genuine remorse, an apology and change*. And if he can't give me what I need... I just can't have a relationship with him anymore, because I am so, *so* tired of being hurt.\n\nIt\u2019s not an irreversible decision. Should he decide to go to therapy and work on himself and then approach me again\u2026 I\u2019d be willing to hear him out.

So I can\u2019t help but already feel judged before I\u2019ve even told them anything. And to be honest, I\u2019m kind of angry too. Everyone is so concerned with his feelings \u2013 what about *mine*? What about the years of sorrow and hurt he caused *me*?\n\nNow I\u2019m just a ball of anxiety and apprehension and I\u2019m not quite sure what to do. I\u2019ve told my therapist and she advised me to write down my reasons for limiting contact with my dad and to explain them once to whoever asks me, then simply respond that I\u2019ve already explained myself if they press on regardless.

Spoiler alert: it got worse. At this point I think I'm looking for the strength to leave him, and it's breaking my heart. \n\nMy leaving party was last night, and my boyfriend \"Liam\" ended up taking the day off work so that he could attend. As I said in the previous post, I was trying to sort this all out while we were away for his mother's birthday weekend. I first tried to arrange it for Saturday (tonight), but one of my friends couldn't make it if that was the case - she was my manager and one of my closest personal friends, so I needed to give her a chance to come. Liam took the day off on Saturday before consulting me, so he was angry about having to change the date, I apologised for messing him about. The whole time I just kept thinking \"I didn\u2019t ask you to do that\"... I wanted him there, but not if it was going to cause problems at work. Anyway, he managed to get the day off and all was well until a couple nights ago. \n\n\nWe had another fight which I detailed in another post on my profile - the TLDR is he was being very possessive while I was out with my girlfriends, despite updating and calling him regularly throughout the whole night, and he ended up going out without letting me know beforehand, with \"(named friend who I know) and some others\", and ended up doing MDMA in his flat by himself because he was sad and wanted to \"feel something\". I don't have too much of a problem with any of those individual behaviours, but I knew for a fact if I'd done even one of those things it'd be a huge sign of disrespect to our relationship in his eyes. So I came over and told him this, I was visibly upset and made it very clear that I was upset because of the double standard. I asked him how he'd feel if I'd behaved how he did, and he agreed he'd be upset. He apologised and hugged me, but I find it very difficult to get over these things straight away. It'd normally be fine, if it weren't for the fact that I just feel like I'm in an endless cycle. I wasn't comfortable there and decided to go home for the night. He was very upset by this and kept saying I was turning it into something huge when he had just apologised. As I went to leave, he started tearing up. I was heartbroken by this, and I hate myself for thinking it but I was worried it was just a tactic to get me to stay. I still ended up leaving but I don't think I'll ever get his expression out of my mind, it was devastating. This was the night before my party. \n\n\nYesterday (my leaving party) comes around, and he tells me he doesn't want to come if we haven't resolved things and I'm still being \"off\" with him (we were both being a little short and not as enthusiastic with each other as usual). I didn't have time to see him earlier in the day since I had a job interview (I got the job!). I called my mother and my sister afterwards to let them know, and went straight home to change and go back out into the city because I was seeing my girlfriends for a few drinks before the actual party. I didn't call Liam but I let him know I got the job. I do feel bad for calling him and he asked why I didn't. Honestly, I didn\u2019t think he would want to hear it. We were still in a stage of not speaking to each other how we usually do. He asked me what my priorities were. I said \"you're asking me this because I called my family about the job and not you?\" he again just asked what my priority is, and what he is to me if not family. I don't even have an answer for that. He is my family but I felt in this situation I'd rather call my mum and sister. I don't know if I'm in the right for that, probably not. \n\n\nHe kept saying he didn\u2019t know if he was coming. He said I was just going to be rude and off with him in front of my friends, I said no, I don't air our grievances publicly, and there's been situations where I had to laugh and smile in front of his family and lie about why he'd hurt his hand instead of truthfully saying he'd punched the bed. He accused me of being fake, I told him there's fake, and there's social aptitude. I told him I'm sorry, I loved him, but this night was very important to me so I was still going to go regardless of what he chose to do. He kept being cruel to me saying \"don't worry, I know I have no sway over YOUR plans\". I ignored his jabs and just kept reiterating that I understood if he didn\u2019t feel like coming, but I'd be disappointed since I did want him there. What I didn\u2019t say was I'd also be disappointed because I'd reorganised things just so he could make it. I was so upset that he'd given me so much grief for maybe not being able to come, and now he wasn't even going to come at all. \n\n\nAnyway, he did end up coming. To be honest, it was absolutely horrible. He arrived to the restaurant I was at with my girlfriends and came to sit with us while we finished up. He'd clearly already been drinking, he completely switches up when he drinks. He becomes so cold and moody. My friends instantly knew something was up, he went out to have a vape and my friend \"Emma\" (the manager) asked if he was ok. I just said he was tired. He would get up to vape and buy more drinks all night, getting more and more drunk, accusing me of paying more attention and being more affectionate to my other friends because he had tried to hug me and I'd rejected him (I never noticed him trying to hug me but I still apologised), and I had hugged my friend when he arrived. For some reason Liam was angry about being ID'd and was rude to the waiter. I apologised and said we knew he was just doing his job. He then for some reason was angry that my friends bought my shots for my leaving party, but didn\u2019t buy him any. He kept saying how rude my friends were when they did the utmost to try and include him. He was annoyed that we were talking about work related topics, when they were literally my colleagues and this was my work leaving event?\n\n\nThe one thing I do agree with him on slightly in terms of my friends' behaviour is that when Emma and her boyfriend left, they both hugged me and said goodbye but didn\u2019t do the same for Liam who was stood beside me. (Edit to clarify: I definitely think they'd be justified in being annoyed at my boyfriend and I wouldn't hug my friend's boyfriend if he behaved the way Liam did either, I personally would feel quite rude if I didn\u2019t still say goodbye just to be cordial but I completely agree that Liam was the one being very rude all night) I do agree this was rude and I didn\u2019t have an explanation for why they did that, or if it was intentional at all.

I was also just an ignorant kid, and so whenever one of the girls got irritated with me for braiding\/touching their hair, I would sulk or laugh, thinking I was just teasing them playfully.

My parents tried to help him, but since they dont work in the same city where we live, I had contact with him. \n\npls note my brother is stronger than me!!!\n\n2 years ago in summer (august 2021) we as a family visited him in his psychiatry, where he was forced by law to go there. He talked to my parents, about how bad they treated him and raised him wrong. My parents left and I stayed, because he started talking about my now ex-girlfriend. He said to me:\"Soon i will break out, find out where (name) lives and r\\*\\*\\* her and you cant do anything about it.\" I didnt tell her that this happened, I had many problems in that time and i couldnt tell anyone anything. I just told her we cant meet at my home anymore and things in our relationship got worse, but thats an other story. In march 2022 I broke up with her, because of many reasons, but one reason was, that i couldnt protect her from this monster.\n\nThe psychiatry let him go, because they said \"there is a higher risk to traumatize the patient for keeping him there.\" On November 28 2022 he broke into our flat, he attacked our mother, I hold him off and threw him out of the flat. I went to the law again, they gave me an interim disposal, which should keep him away. \n\nLong story short: He ignored this piece of paper, we called police several times, nothing changed.\n\nToday he threw rocks in our window, scared the shit out of my mom, hit my father with the 2nd stone. In one moment i was ready to storm out with the pepper spray I bought and spray him down. Break all his bones so he wont be able to do anything. Police arrived and sent him home. Nothing more nothing less. Now he could just come back, throw rocks and other stuff again, break in or worse. This problem wont solve. Right now i feel nothing. Just an empty head. This problem wont be solved with police, law or anything like that. Im thinking about ending it a different way. I dont know what else is left to do. I mean we tried everything we could.","upvote_ratio":0.5,"created_utc":1678638255.0},{"title":"Maybe I am the problem","author":"jennie033","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TrueOffMyChest\/comments\/11pdk9t\/maybe_i_am_the_problem\/","text":"Everyone ends up excluding me.

But instead of getting professional help for the problem child, they just encouraged him to join the army! \n\nWe met when he was close to finishing military prep college and would be looking at who he wanted to enlist with (though he quit after 1 week of basic training and came home).

Also sorry this is long.\nBackstory: I (19F) have been friends with a group of guys for about 3 ish years I met them through my best friend( they were all friends before for a few years.) One of the guys(I\u2019ll call him E)and I became very close, I considered him my best friend or even a kindred spirit so I trusted this guy wholeheartedly.(I\u2019ll add that he tried pursing something with me but I shut it down every-time cause I knew my best friend liked him and even they kinda fell out I continued to reject his advances)\n\nAnyways we all hung out yesterday but I had to leave early. The energy seemed off but I chalked it up to me being paranoid. That group of guys ,a guy Im talking to ( Let\u2019s call him M)and some of my other girl friends went bar hopping and got really drunk. I already a bad feeling but I just ignored it, half way into the night the guy I\u2019m talking to (M)starts messaging me  these really angry and confusing texts. Asking me if I\u2019m wasting his time, if I\u2019m sure I like him, saying he doesn\u2019t know if he wants a relationship anymore, just going off on me.It was really bad like I started sobbing ( Mind you I am confused cause we spent the past two days together and we left on good note)When he finally calms down he explains they were going through each other galleries.M shows his gallery and there are pictures of me in it.Then E and some of the other guys start bragging about their collection of nudes. So they take out their phones and are showing the others their pictures. So when one of the girls sees the picture of me in M\u2019s phones she says oh E has pictures of her too and E tries to shut her up. Then they all start laughing and acting sneaky then show M a nude they claim to be a picture of me and ask if he\u2019s ever seen that picture. When he says no all these guys start laughing in his face and mocking him. Now I am the type of person that NEVER EVERR sends full nudes (I don\u2019t even send nudes at all unless it someone I dating and EVEN THENN it\u2019s done in a way that if they got out I could post it myself too) and from the description of the picture, of what underwear the person is wearing, how they are posed (I pose in a very particular way the person is standing l\u2019m insecure about my lower body so I NEVERRRR pose standing up in any picture AT ALL)and the background and the mirror used to take it doesn\u2019t sound like me at all. Anyways M tells me that the picture looks like me and all my friends including E and the girls start laughing and talking shit about me not one of them defends me or try\u2019s to delete the picture. I\u2019ll also add that my best friend is good friends with these guys and less than 4 weeks ago she messaged me very upset and sad because someone had told her that E and I were fucking around.Which isn\u2019t true but she believed it and said that she sensed something and how I was replacing her with him and how  have no loyalty because E and I were still friends after they fell off.So if these so called picture of me are exposed ( which they might be because E as of recently like to fuck around )that is going to kill our friendship and I know her well enough that she probably isn\u2019t going to believe me and it\u2019s already putting a strain on the connection that me and M have. Correction he doesn\u2019t want talk to me right now he wants to \u201ccool down\u201d.I don\u2019t know what to do I want to see the picture and confront E about it but that would mean M being a snitch to his own friends he doesn\u2019t want that. I want ask the one of the other guys but I don\u2019t trust them not to lie.I want to cut my friendship with all those ppl but then they might retaliate with anger and post it and send it my best friends. I live in a small town so rumors and pictures like that travel.I\u2019m stuck in a hard position and I don\u2019t know what to do. These people are my closet friends I tell what I\u2019m going through ,go to the for advice and comfort and they do the same with me. I\u2019m so hurt and confused right now.\n\nEdit: My face isn\u2019t in the picture it\u2019s covered with a sticker but body wise M told me it looked like me. About 80% sure and this picture was in a folder labeled with my name in E\u2019s phone.\n\nUPDATE: I\u2019ve confirmed the pictures are not of me but of another mutual female friend who is shaped similar to me.

I don't have any ill feelings towards her about it. I'm not an easy person due to various issues so I'm grateful to have even had her.\n\nI feel like my life very suddenly has no purpose, she's the only good thing I've ever had. I don't have friends, I don't speak to my family. I work from home and hardly have any human interaction. I'm socially awkward (never made friends since as young as I can remember), have crippling social anxiety which just gets worse the more I insulate myself from people. The very first time we had a conversation (at work) it was so effortless, easy, magical, I'd never known anything like it, never thought it was possible. To just have a conversation that flows. To not have to sit there thinking about what I should say next. I thought it was still going well until now. I felt like we were a permanent thing, just unmarried because I don't believe in it. To this day she's the only person who got me. I had no idea this was coming. I'm really struggling to process it. I imagine I'll be alone for the rest of my life.\n\nNow I'm looking at the empty spaces where she's taken some belongings already and it makes me very sad. I look at the things which are still here and get sad thinking of them disappearing next time she comes. I've cried for the first time in my adult life. My chest is tight. I've never felt much sadness in my life, even when \"close\" family members passed away, so I wondered what kind of personality disorder I must have. But I am truly devastated and lost. At times it feels unbearable. This is a feeling I didn't know I could feel.\n\nShe wants to be friends but I don't see how that will work. I don't want to lose her from my life completely but I don't think I could stop hoping she'll change her mind. Is that really a friendship? Will it just torture me? Will it be unfair on her?\n\nI'm sure time will heal. And then once I'm past the worst of it I should probably seek therapy for my other issues. They say you can't expect love if you don't love yourself, and I don't. I don't know if writing this out will help at all but I feel like I need to get it out.

Got kicked out to live with our dad. I didn't get the chance to get out and live with our dad because I was \"better at dealing with mom\" and didn't have it as bad as sib, and any time I brought it up mom was mad for two weeks. Our dad focused on sib and our mom focused on me. Our mom was narcissistic and emotionally manipulative and used me as her live-in therapist but I was just so adaptable! And mom's favorite! So according to our dad he didn't need to put in as much effort with me, it wasn't fair for me to have 2 parents and my sibling to have 1. Sibling was delighted with this and every time I went over to dad's for the weekend made damn sure I knew that it wasn't my house and my input didn't matter. That they had it SO much worse. Because at least I had mom focusing on me. The mom that sib had spent my entire childhood fearing and telling me how evil she was.\n\nOur dad outright told me to my face when I was seven that I wasn't wanted and the reason they divorced. He put the token effort in to relate with me. But he was never attached to me like he was my sibling. He was a stay-at-home dad for them, he taught them how to read and how to ride a bike and painted the nursery and made them custom instruments. I learned to ride a bike at 14 by accidentally drifting into the road and adrenaline-boosting myself back into the driveway, because the only one willing to teach me was mom, and only when she felt like it. I'm 26 now and talk to dad basically on holidays only. He hasn't reached out in two years.\n\nIt took my sibling until last year to realize our dad wasn't perfect. That I didn't have the same experience. That our mom isn't pure evil and our dad isnt pure good. \nI just cannot put to words the way this frustrates me. How do you go so long living in a black-and-white world? How do you spend so much of your life not taking a step back and looking for nuance?\nHow do you have so much trauma and yet not a single speck of situational awareness?\nI spent my whole fucking life watching you, and watching mom, and watching dad, trying to make sense of WHY my pain wasn't worth it to anyone. I kept your secrets. I accepted your mistreatment because mom had hurt you and I thought that was only fair. I accepted living with mom because I thought it was the only way I could make up for breaking up YOUR happy family by existing.\nI know I was mom's golden child. How do *you* not know that you were dad's? *How has it taken you this long?*\n\nI dunno. Maybe I'm just bitter that I spent so long silently suffering for **your sake** and it turns out that you never saw a single second of it. You whine and martyr about how tough it is being the oldest but that doesn't stop you from being blind.","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1678575262.0},{"title":"My brother-in-law drank himself to death.

I thought it would be fun and something new for us as a family to experience. First off my children are 12, 13 and 9. \nThey were very excited to do this and picked out the class we should attend. \n\n\n\nEverything was going well at the beginning. I should say my middle child has ADD, is very sensitive and takes a long time to complete tasks. I should have taken this into consideration. \n\nThe instructor said one point in the painting you had to \"move fast\"\" so the paint would not dry. And when everyone else was like on step 3, my daughter was still on step 1. And I was fearing that she was not going to get the paints blended in time and then she would later cry at home because of it. \n\nI started saying\" (name) you have to blend the paints. You should start blending the paints...you're not blending..\" and I was dumb and tried to help.. \n\nAll of a sudden, she starts crying. She's bursting with tears \"you are criticizing my painting mom..\". I tried to tell her I was not criticizing. I just thought we had to move fast and I did not mean to make her cry.. \n\nI felt like such an asshole the rest of the night. And the instructor just kept glaring at me like I was an absolutely terrible mother.\n\nMy husband stepped in and saved the day. He helped her get on track , but from then on , the instructor did not seem comfortable and the whole demeanor of the class changed. \n\nI wish I would have hugged her and said it was all right. No worries, it's just art. \n\nAlso, her Art turned out Beautiful. And I should have just let her do her thing. I don't know why I was rushing her knowing that she has never gone at the pace of everyone else. \n\nBefore yesterday, I had already been struggling with depression as well. I was hoping that participating in this class would help . I always feel like I'm not good enough for my children. I feel like my children are annoyed with me a lot lately, while my husband can swwop in and make them better.\n\nI have been a SAHM for almost 14 years and I guess recently I have not been the best. I try very hard to be there for them ALL the time . But, I seem to be just an annoyances to my children lately. I am the parent that has to check up on their schooling, tell them to clean their room etc.. and I want to be the fun mom. \n\nI swear being a mother is one of the hardest things I have done. I thought The Military was tough when I was younger, but I feel like I am failing as a mom. \n\nSometimes I think I should never have become a mom. Especially after yesterday when I made my daughter cry. I did not mean to make her cry and apologized profusely, but I can't stop thinking about it. \n\nI felt selfiah after the class yesterday . I should not have tried to get my daughter to move faster\n\n\nPlease no negative comments. I apologized to my daughter. I just need to be better. \n\nFinally, I will say again, her art work turned out Beautiful. She has ways been really good with art. \n\nAnd my artwork turned out absolutely terrible.","upvote_ratio":0.75,"created_utc":1678614010.0},{"title":"I don't think I wanna be friends with my beast friend anymore","author":"Slight-Ingenuity4545","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TrueOffMyChest\/comments\/11p6q9b\/i_dont_think_i_wanna_be_friends_with_my_beast\/","text":"Edit: title is supposed to say Best not Beast\n\nThis is the first post I\u2019ve ever done so I apologize if it sounds like a 5th grader wrote it. I\u2019m also sorry if this sounds like some kind of petty high schooler drama. I've never had a conflict this big with my friends and I need an unbiased perspective.\n\n\nMe (F18) and my best friend (F18) recently turned 18. I turned 18 a few months before she did. Let\u2019s call her Amy. Before we get to the story let me give some context. I have just recently realized that I have been the doormat in this friendship. Anytime time or money has been involved between us, I\u2019m expected to expend my resources because her parents are always \u201cso strict\u201d. Before I got my license it was always my parents who drove us around or my parents who would spend money on us. Whenever I got my license and a job, I drove us everywhere and spent money on both of us. Obviously, as a child, I never second guess that she was always tight on money and had strict parents. I understood where she came from. But she didn't seem like she came from a poor family. She's always had expensive tastes and has had some kind of superiority complex over everyone. ANd she's also an only child. Anyways, now to the story.\n\n\nAbout a week before my birthday, it came up in casual conversation that my birthday was coming up the next week. My birthday fell on a Friday so I thought we\u2019d be able to celebrate that weekend. I would expect her at least remember my birthday, but she didn\u2019t. She had told me that \u201cshe forgot\u201d and had something important to do with her family that weekend. I\u2019ve known this girl for years, I know she would rather do anything else rather than spend time with her extended family. I felt a bit discouraged but said that it was fine (it wasn\u2019t) and that we could just hang out the next weekend. Throughout the week we were planning what do to. I invited Amy and another longtime friend. Let\u2019s call him James. James also comes from a poor family, and is also closeted, but he has always been the sweetest person I know. At the time, both Amy and I have been in relationships. I was PLANNING to bring my boyfriend. However, she EXPLICITLY told me not to bring my boyfriend because it would make James jealous and uncomfortable. I agreed because I would never want to make him feel uncomfortable, so we just agreed on \"girly time\" as we call it. When the time of the celebration comes, she pulls up to my house with James and walks to the door with an aloe vera plant. I had asked for this plant for a few years now. Amy's parents are very big plant people so it was easy for her to get one, free of charge. I thanked her and we went on our way to celebrate.\n\n\nI had gotten a big sum of money from my parents for my birthday. So, the whole plan was just to go shopping at a popular, and expensive, shopping center. Maybe get some lunch or a little dessert as a special treat. So we go about shopping, we walk to multiple different stores. Finally, we get to Forever 21. We walk around and James finds a sweater that he really loves and wants. It's important to note that Amy and James did not have a lot of money to spend on anything other than lunch. I offer that I'll buy something he likes because it's rare for him to get new clothes. He politely declines my offer because he has just enough money to. I keep my offer on the table and we continue shopping. While walking around, Amy picked up a dress. I thought nothing of it at the time. When we get to the checkout, James pays for his stuff first. I go next and put the stuff I have accumulated while shopping on the counter. Then, Amy puts her dress right on top of my things. While I did not specify that the offer to buy things was specifically for James, I thought that Amy would take the hint. I checkout and the bill comes to around $150. I didn't expect that I would be paying for Amy's dress so I said.\" I really wish you would've told me that I was buying you that dress before you put it with my stuff.\" She didn't seem apologetic at all. All she said was \"thanks\" in the most monotone tone you could expect. \n\n\nThat REALLY threw me off and so I decided that we should find some quick food and just go home. We end up stopping at McD's and that's when she decides that she can pay for herself and buys her own food. I was honestly appalled because she had decided that she could pay for her own food, but not her clothes? And you might be thinking, How much was the dress? The dress she got was $20, and her meal at Mc'Ds was $12, Max. After lunch we head back to my house I'm under the impression that we'll hang out for a few more hours. Not to her. We're hanging out in my room for about 30 minutes and the gathers her stuff up quickly and says that she's going home. She also tells me that I need to take James home since she's going home. Not the best way to put it IMO but I'm just drained from the whole experience so I take James home and that's the end of it. The next time I see her in school, I ask her if she can pay me back for the dress. In the past, I have never explicitly asked her to pay me back for things. It's always been I get you, you get me next time kinda thing. It was only $20 so no big deal right? Wrong. She proceeds to go off on me and says, \"You don't have to be a bitch about it. If you want the money back so bad why don't you just take the dress and return it yourself?\". I was taken aback and honestly shocked. I didn't know how to respond so I just left. Eventually, I worked up the courage to talk to her and said that what she did wasn't cool. She just said next time specify who you're offering to buy things for, and she also never actually paid me back.\n\n\nFrom my point of view, she was just kinda bitchy the whole day. On top of the fact that Amy even said that the Aloe Vera plant she got me didn't count as a birthday present because I've been asking for it for so long. So she just admits that she didn't get me a birthday present. I'm finding this whole situation to be unfair because 1. We couldn't hang out on my birthday because I'm 70% sure she lied to me about being busy. 2. She didn't get me a birthday present or something to suffice as a birthday cake. 3. I bought HER something celebrating MY birthday.  and 4. she called me a bitch for asking for her to pay me back. I honestly would've been fine if she had at least offered to buy me something. It seemed to me that she was thinking of herself the whole time. But yeah that's it. I'll update if there are any questions. I just wanna know if what she did was wrong or if I did anything that seemed asshole-ish.\n\n\nTLDR: My best friend made my birthday the worst i\u2019ve ever had. I bought her shit on my birthday and she called me a bitch for asking her to pay me back.\n\n\nEdit: For Amy\u2019s birthday she got a nice ass hotel room and we did a shit ton of things for her. Got her a cake, real presents etc. AND her boyfriend was allowed to come along and essentially spend the whole celebration. But I wasn\u2019t ALLOWED to bring my boyfriend JUST to the nice ass dinner she had. I would\u2019ve paid for him, or he could\u2019ve paid for himself.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678600157.0},{"title":"Feeling it","author":"Practical-Bad-4231","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TrueOffMyChest\/comments\/11p6pb1\/feeling_it\/","text":"For once I want to talk to you again just like the old times\n\nTo sleep forever and forget the pain,\nthat once was felt with no gain;\nHe tried his best to no avail,\nhis heart could stand no more hell;\nSo he ran away to be forgotten,\nso that he could die alone and rotten;\nFor his heart was gone shattered to bits,\nforever lost in the deepest pits;\nIf you wish to find him look into the shadows of every hole,\nif only to remember what you left in his chest that is now not whole.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678600069.0},{"title":"my neighbor deceived me into helping him buy drugs...now what","author":"IgnorantMule","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TrueOffMyChest\/comments\/11p40h7\/my_neighbor_deceived_me_into_helping_him_buy\/","text":"This is a throwaway account I created just for this post, my real account has videos of me playing instruments that I don't want attached to this.\n\nI live in an apartment building with my wife and dog, and everything is generally fine here. People don't pick up their dog shit and occasionally there is some package theft, but everyone is quiet or nice enough. An apartment down the hall houses a husband and wife, mid 40s, who are always very nice to me and my dog (my wife has somehow never met them, her schedule is opposite of mine). Anyway, today my dog and I were leaving the community dog park and going to pick me up some food when the male neighbor was standing on the corner and waved me down. He knows our names and said hi and was very friendly, and asked if I could help him out and give him a ride 15 minutes away. I had nothing else going on so I said of course; he got in the front seat and my dog was in the back seat. \n\nHe wouldn't give me the address for my gps, but while we were having small talk he would say \"turn here\" or whatnot and guide me. He tried to smoke a cig in my car without asking and I had to tell him that there's no smoking in my car. We pull up to a random liquor store with people loitering outside, he gets out and walks around the corner, and comes right back without ever entering the store and tries to get in the back seat, trying to slide my dog over to make space. I ask what he's doing, and he is saying there's no room in the front seat. I asked if someone else was joining us, and he said no but there's not enough space up front. (this guy is pretty big, and my back seat has stuff on the floor; he would never fit). This is the first time that I started feeling uncomfortable and didn't know what to do. I told him he wasn't getting in the backseat and I'm going home now, so he just got in the front and we drove off. \n\nA minute or two later he pulled out a very small bag and a small clear glass pipe. He bit open his bag and started packing the pipe. I saw it and immediately started asking what is he doing, why is he doing that, please put that away, etc... trying to stay calm but I felt very panicked. This guy knew he was getting me to take him to buy drugs, and just chitchatted like nothing was happening. I started to question what other things he may be capable of, and feared for my safety but just truly wanted this scenario to be over. He put everything back in his pocket, and I said i'm going home now and he could either get out somewhere along the way or at the apartment. He kept saying he was going to get out \"down the street\", but it was nowhere along the path. I should have kicked him out, but at this point I was truly fearing any more confrontation. We made it all the way back to our building, and I just double parked by the door so he would get out (I wasn't going inside with him). I watched him walk through the door into the hallway, and through the window of the door, I could see him smoke his pipe in the hallway.\n\nI have no problem with people doing drugs at home. I suppose I have my own moral line of what drugs I think are appropriate, but regardless... I can't hate on anyone being high in their own home. But this person recruited me into this and I feel so uneasy living next to him. He's never been anything other than nice (and even in today's bullshit escapades he was still friendly enough), and my assumption is that his wife doesn't know about this, or else he wouldn't be hitchhiking to buy crack and smoke it in the public hallway of his apartment building. So it's hard to tell what type of person I'm living next to, or how to proceed from here. We're friends with another couple down the hall, who happen to be this guy's neighbor, so is this something I should tell them about? Is something I should report to the police or our worthless leasing agent? I don't give a shit that he is doing drugs, I give a shit that he got me involved. (At one point when we were in the car, I thought about driving straight to a police station or getting pulled over for speeding, but honestly I assumed the guy was armed.) My wife is out of town currently, but she thinks I need to try to relax and do my best to avoid them in the future. At least I know where I can find some crack when I'm ready to get to relaxing.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678591796.0},{"title":"i\u2019m losing all of my friends but i\u2019m happy","author":"WTFPOSERO","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TrueOffMyChest\/comments\/11p826u\/im_losing_all_of_my_friends_but_im_happy\/","text":"I\u2019m losing everyone that i know left and right, but i don\u2019t seem to be sad. i just got a new job, helping my girlfriend move into her place, and i\u2019m saving up to eventually be able to transfer and move in with her. \n\n\na lot of my friends are frustrated because they think i spend too much time with a girl who i\u2019ll just eventually breakup with, but that\u2019s simply because of my past with women. i would sleep around and had a reputation.\n\nin just 6 months, she has introduced me to a lifestyle i would\u2019ve never imagined myself in. i\u2019m more spiritually inclined, physically capable, and even mentally stable. i couldn\u2019t begin to describe our dynamic. \n\nfor a bit of context as to how much time we\u2019ve spent together. it\u2019s been every single day since late november. \n\nwe aren\u2019t very flaunting of our relationship, but because we\u2019re in highschool, word gets around pretty fast. we like our privacy, so we didn\u2019t share our experience together with tons of people. \n\nwhen we did all kinds of rumors came out (this is where that reputation comes in) her ex was in class when he told a group that she was a bitch and said \u201cshe broke up with me but at least i\u2019m not a cheater whose playing her\u201d. \n\nthis pissed me off for a multitude of reasons but i especially didn\u2019t like when he called her a bitch, not even two months ago he was begging her to stay in his life. it\u2019s sickening. \n\ni wish people could see how close we are but then again i could care less, it\u2019s a contradicting statement i know but it\u2019s how i feel. \n\nwe have such an amazing bond and i can\u2019t wait to see what the future awaits.\n\nthank you for reading, i know this was off from what the prompt was, but this was all \u201ctrue off my chest\u201d","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678604666.0},{"title":"I dream about abandoning my family","author":"boriboriguy","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TrueOffMyChest\/comments\/11pdzdb\/i_dream_about_abandoning_my_family\/","text":"\\\\\n\nI don't like my family.

I was the golden child in my childhood, effortlessly excelling at things, I was always the smartest in the room till grade 10, I chose a wrong set of subjects to study in my grade-11&12 because of my parents and I was at my lowest those two years. I quickly found a career path I liked and somehow convinced my parents to let me take up that path.\nWrote entrance exams for that degree and got into a average university but I was glad that I get to study that subject,, made few friends in the first year but there was always a cloud of sadness over me, I was always negative and expecting the worst of everything and not to mention my grades were also average. Covid started, I got my freshman year results and it was bad. Over the summer break something in me changed and I started to work hard, I just wanted to prove myself I guess. Started to ace all the tests and in fact came in first position after so many years and boy did it feel good. All my friends in university used to have fun and enjoy their life and not care about grades at all but me on the side, I was going crazy if I got even one mark less than 100. Spent 2 years of covid isolation working my ass off. My interest in academics increased and my next goal was to get education from a top university. I saw many people from other top universities in my country easily getting many internships even if their work is equivalent or sometimes even worse than mine. That pissed me off and reality started to surface quickly. No matter how my work and how many hours I put in I couldn\u2019t get any summer internships at all and because it was a compulsory credit I had to settle for a mediocre unpaid one. That summer I\u2019ve decided to apply for masters and try to improve my skills so that I can get better jobs and also for once I wanted to learn from the experts. \n\nI applied to 9 universities, till now 1 acceptance and 4 of them already rejected me and the worst part is that the profiles worst than me got in. It was not only just a big hit to my ego but also to my self worth. I got one acceptance but every rejection is hurting me. I had to work so hard to craft the applications and it looks like I\u2019m just a worthless person. I just wasted tons of my parents money just to get rejected? Maybe I set my set my expectation to high maybe I\u2019m just a dummy who just got lucky those 2 years.

She says and does weird stuff all the time and sometimes makes me feel uncomfortable. I don't know how they're even friends.

It's fantastic really. My parents have a super nice and very large house, I get along with them really well, and the rent free part is amazing. But I want to go to college and found the perfect university I want to attend in a different state. It has everything I want in a university, a speech and hearing undergraduate degree (which apparently doesn't exist in my own state??), a deaf studies minor, rotc college, and is in a state that is considerably cheaper then the state I currently live in. Here's the issue, I can't afford the move.\n\nI have a baby girl, she's 5 months old next week so I can't get a dorm room. I've been looking at housing options and I've found several 3 bedrooms for $1200 which is a fantastic price compared to what the options are here (I found a single room for rent for 1200 here \ud83d\udc80). I could of course look for smaller housing, but with myself, my daughter, and my boyfriend who would come with us I can't imagine living in a studio while I go to school for the next 6 years while I pursue a medical degree.\n\nDaycare\/nanny is roughly 600 a month give or take. But I need someone to watch her because I can't take her to class, and I need to have at least a part time job to afford everything. My boyfriend has agreed to work full time while I'm in school, and once I am solid in my career he will become a stay at home dad and take care of the house and kids (it's what he wants I promise I didn't ask him to do that). But I don't know if we can rely 100% on his income alone while I'm going to not just university but medical school. I built a projected budget for my stuff alone that included rent, tuition (before any grants or scholarships), insurance fees, childcare, food, etc and the total came out to be 4300ish a month. That's a LOT of money monthly and expecting my boyfriend to cover all of that as well as anything else he needs is ridiculous.\n\nI was looking at costs of uhaul today, it's roughly 1300 to rent a trailer, or 1400 to rent a shipping container and have them ship it. Then I have to pay first last rent, and the gas to get my vehicle down there (19 hour drive and that doesn't include stopping every few hours to eat and feed baby girl). Then we have to stock the house with any added furniture that is required that we don't have, have to buy the kitchen from almost scratch, fill the kitchen with food\/buy meals until we can, and we aren't getting any income for at least a week so we can drive there, unpack, and get settled. The first month of a move is always the most exspensive. While I have everything needed for baby girl including all furniture, the stuff we have for the two of us is considerably lacking because we both live with our parents currently.\n\nBoth of us are military. My boyfriend was infantry Marines for 4 years and got out almost 2 years ago. I'm a reservist and have a year and a half left. But because he's out his benefits are free college for himself and a VA home loan that we don't want to use for my college. As a reservist my benefits hardly exist. I do have a partial gi bill, but that is about $600 monthly and while it certainly helps won't put a dent in monthly expenses. It also means that I have to fly back to my home base every month, which will cost me. They will reimburse me for my flights every time but I have to pay out of pocket first. I was trying to join the rotc program at the university which would pay 100% for my tuition and would Jumpstart my career in almost every way, but after reaching out to recruiters in my state, that state, and the program directly, not a single person has responded to me. Which honestly makes zero sense since there's still enlisted recruiters hounding my brother who talked to them 5 years ago and decided not to join. But hey someone who wants to is ignored. Thanks uncle Sam.\n\nNow you could be thinking \"OK so don't move and go to college where you are\" and I certainly could do that. But the medical colleges here are drastically more exspensive then where I want to go. I also want to move out of my parents, not because I dislike living with them quite the opposite, but because I have a baby girl and I want to live with my boyfriend so we can be a family. Currently we spend our weekends together and that's great but I do want to see what kind of dad he can be on a daily instead of weekly basis. Like I said earlier, I found a room for rent for 1200 here. No thanks.\n\nSo I'm just struggling. I want a career as an audiologist, and to do that I need to go to college full time and have lots of time to study. But going to a college here for 10k extra makes no sense. I could find a smaller place to rent, and I probably have to, but I don't want the 3 of us to be crowded in a cramped space. I could ditch my medical career altogether and give up on being able to support my family 100% and force my boyfriend to work the rest of our lives while we struggle to afford living and can't have anymore kids without substantial income. But hey, I'd rather not.\n\nSo yeah I'm just applying for scholarships hoping to the Goddess above that I get something, looking into state benefits, trying to work with my career planner on base to get military aid (doesn't seem like they will be much help financially), and wondering if a recruiter will ever respond to my calls and emails.\n\nTldr my state is insanely exspensive to live in and yet the cost of moving is so daunting as well","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678598781.0},{"title":"My grandma is dying and I don\u2019t think I am sad enough","author":"Zegr08","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TrueOffMyChest\/comments\/11p6370\/my_grandma_is_dying_and_i_dont_think_i_am_sad\/","text":"First I have to say she IS NOT a bad person, but she isn\u2019t a loving person, her side of the family jokes are just about making fun between each other, is bullying, kinda fun but still not liking it.

I am great at it but am working on not losing myself under pressure.\n\nStory: We were doing assessments on Friday and I was doing better than I thought I would under pressure. A surprise assessment on Monday left me unconfident because I had to keep myself from losing it and remain focused on what was being asked of me.\n\nI an doing well. It's a physical assessment.

I finish my fourth or so task and am about to finish my fifth when a coworker(I'll call her Lina) adds additional requirements while I'm finalising my second last task. These requirements are unspoken and the assessor is focused on something else and doesn't notice but I do.(Gotta pay attention to detail for this job) My friend notices as she is watching what is happening. (We tell each other if a mistake is made so we need to pay attention to each other's work.)\n\nI can't comment, but I know that Lisa, who is so nice to everyone just tried to get me to look as though I just made a big mistake because if I started sending the fifth task out and the assessor just saw the extra requirement and my position she would have told me I'm doing things wrong. I know at this point that Lisa has tried to screw me over. I can't say anything, have to be focused and confident. Not my strong suite but I've gotten better recently.\n\nWe can do these types of things to each other during training to test eachother but this was an actual assessment in which we would be kicked from the program if we weren't up to standard or couldn't handle the pressure.\n\nSomebody _was_ kicked after assessments and Lisa actually came to me and a friend in tears, stating \"That just could've been any one of us.\" Damn right it could've.

And the worst part is that I doubt myself so much. Maybe she's really just so stupid and didn't realise that she would put me at risk.

And a lot of my old friends back home compliment me that I look prettier but couldn\u2019t pinpoint what. \n\nI keep making more money, investing in myself, making more friends, and the snowball effect gets bigger and bigger.\n\nI have gotten used to the new me, and it didn't hit me until not long ago when one of my friends introduced a guy to me who was also from my home country, and it turns out he was from the cool kids group. \n\nThis really hit home. And it made me reflect on how far I have come. If I had never come to the acceptance of the rules, I wouldn\u2019t be able to explore life to my full potential like now .\n\nI wasn't super smart to the point that I could change the world or have a grand mission in life like Bezos or Bill Gates. I was just simply accepting the rules... \n\nIf you can't beat it, join it.","upvote_ratio":0.78,"created_utc":1678579065.0},{"title":"My convocation is in next 1 month and I am having anxiety about it.","author":"Ok_Understanding7043","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TrueOffMyChest\/comments\/11pbb7p\/my_convocation_is_in_next_1_month_and_i_am_having\/","text":"Hi all , firstly I'd like to acknowledge this sub for helping me calm my anxiety at times.\n\nSo a little bit about me - I am almost done with my medical school and my convocation is in 1 month.

I\u2019ve lived on my own since then for five years, and have one more year to go in my studies. My dad is extremely wealthy, and so is my brother, who\u2019s a dentist. \n\nLast year, before summer, I had a massive exam coming up. It was the hardest exam of my medical studies, and is the last step of basically guaranteeing graduation. Before this exam, I had some money saved up from my birthday, and decided to buy a packet of cigarettes, it was an extremely stupid decision, and the biggest regret in my life. After buying these cigarettes, I smoked them, and my brother noticed the purchase in my online banking app. After he noticed, he cut my living allowance (money for food, transport, toiletries, basically everything except tuition and rent) to 3 dollars a day, from my previous 12(USD). I lived off of that for 3 months, lost around 30KG. Two months after I passed the exam, I was increased to, thank god, 40 dollars a week. I always thought this was enough, and this is how everyone should live, I always had enough to eat two meals a day, so I never questioned, but the country I study in has been going under some hard times, and the price of everything has almost tripled. \n\nNow we get to now. Ever since Christmas, I\u2019ve been slowly fucking starving. I begged my brother to help me because he\u2019s very well off, god bless, not in a small way, in a very large way and he accused me of eating all my money on cigarettes. I tried telling him it\u2019s not the case, going as far as documenting my spending for months, to no avail. For months I was screamed at over the phone, ridiculed, accused of wasting my money every week When I asked for my allowance. I was too scared to get a job, as my dad was always extremely against it, telling me he\u2019d stop paying for my tuition and that he can provide everything I need if I ever worked but I couldn\u2019t take it anymore. I\u2019d go to restaurants with my friends and drink water, whenever I\u2019d go to the stores I\u2019d have my calculator ready incase I overspend and would have to miss meals because of it. I cried myself to sleep countless times because I just wanted to eat something other than oats with water for dinner. I honestly fucking hated my life. All around me I saw people eating meat and wished I could try some. I ate eggs for dinner when I didn\u2019t have any unexpected expenses, but if I ever needed to buy say, toothpaste I\u2019d be fucked for the next day. Everything recently changed when my friend asked me if I\u2019d want to work part time for his uncles company. I was so scared to say yes but I asked how much he\u2019d pay me and it was ten dollars. I almost cried with how much money it was, so I told him I\u2019ll go and meet his uncle. My friend thought I was going to work for a few hours a week but his uncle gave me almost 7 hours a day and I took all the hours available. When he found out he got really mad and told me it was so irresponsible of me to take so many hours ontop of my studies for no reason. He lectures me for a few more minutes then I broke down crying and told him I\u2019d been starving to death slowly. After this, he told me he was sorry, and that he never knew, because I hid it so well. It\u2019s true, I always had excuses for not eating around my friends, so no one ever clued on.\n\nI told my dad I\u2019m working now, my brother screamed at me on the phone but I didn\u2019t give a fuck. I\u2019m never ever going to beg anyone for money ever again. I get my first pay check next week and the first thing I\u2019m going to buy is ice cream and some fried chicken. I\u2019m going to drink cola. I can almost cry just thinking about it all. I\u2019m never going to forgive them for what they did to me here. I\u2019ll hate my brother in my heart for cutting my money.\n\nSorry for my extremely bad English, I study in Germany and barely use it.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1678491577.0},{"title":"Can we stop saying \u201cunironically\u201d?

I didn\u2019t find out until I was pregnant. In the beginning of my pregnancy the woman at my job he had been sleeping with told me everything. He was apologetic at first but I was so upset and humiliated because she showed coworkers their text messages of him begging to preform oral on her \u201cone last time\u201d. She was tired of being on the side. He had recently lost his job so while I was work 10+ hrs a day he was using my car and money to cheat. He finally got a new job making close to my income so I guess he felt like he didn\u2019t need me anymore. I would come home crying and fussing because I was so embarrassed about everyone at my job knowing our relationship drama on top of me being pregnant. He got tired of the arguing and move to his mom house to cut back on the arguing so he said. But in reality he was sleeping with his coworker in my car and a few other women. I didn\u2019t find out the truth until I was 9 months pregnant and he admitted to sleeping with one of his female \u201cfriends\u201d who I was suspicious of when I saw him liking all her pic online. When I came to his mom house crying about it and making him call her to break things off I saw a video of him having sex with his coworker in my car that he kept as a trophy. This broke me and I fell apart. He basically abandoned me while I was pregnant so he could sleep around. I worked 2 jobs took care of my oldest kid cut grass and prepared for a baby alone. Sometimes he would come to my appointments but was very cold to me. He would barely speak. When he sat down he would make sure he didn\u2019t accidentally touch me. I missed him so much I took the treatment because I just wanted him around. Literally moments after I gave birth he told his mom within earshot of me that he wouldn\u2019t post a pic of our baby because he didn\u2019t want the girl from my job commenting and acting crazy. I was hurt that she was on his mind right after I had our son. The next day while still at the hospital he looked over at me and said how did free food turn into a baby. Basically sum me up to that. I turned and pulled the cover over me and silently cried so he couldn\u2019t hear me. I took him back because I really love him and wanted our family. He was probably still cheating the entire time but 2 months later he gave me a std and I put him out. To this day he is still very cold to me. He was never apologetic until around tax time. He basically wanted money from me until he saw his name as crumb snatcher in my phone lol. And told me he wanted nothing from me. I still love him but I know he never loved me. He love to remind me by telling me he don\u2019t love me when we\u2019re arguing. I have been blocked from his phone for maybe a month. I had a dream about what I went through with him Again and woke up crying. Our son is 8 months now and I\u2019m finally giving up hope of him realizing what we had. I\u2019m not reaching out for anything again. He communicate to me through his mom and I\u2019m going to respect that and stop calling him from my daughter phone for things for our kid \u201cI really just want to hear his voice\u201d I\u2019m going to get my mom to drop our son off to him instead of doing it myself. I just want to move on and not see him because it\u2019s possible. I\u2019ll file for child support soon. Last he told me he doesn\u2019t have a job or car. Im giving up. I want to be happy again and finding ways to be near him only hurt me he doesn\u2019t care about me and is most likely annoyed with anything dealing with me.

I will not comment further; so any speculation or analysis I shall not comment. I do not want the standard \u201cyou are a good person\u201d shit; nor do I want any invocation of deities or theological texts; nor will I hear the standard \u201cnihilistic\u201d philosophy rhetoric. I do not possess harm of myself or others, heads up.  If you know who I am, I ask that you keep my name out (this post is intended to be anonymous).  \n\nThroughout my life, I have considered myself the most hated, regardless of age. Be it that kid who never is invited to a party (I recently texted someone what it was like to be in a house party), be it someone who once had their own hotel rooms during state extracurricular activity trips due to no one wanting to room with me. At my grad party, two peers showed up for approximately thirty minutes each. \n\nI do not possess someone I would consider a friend. My last human as a friend left in June of 2007. My last get together with a peer in a house was in early-to-mid 2005 at some throwaway birthday party when I was a kid. I remember once being dragged out by six peers when I attempted to enter a party.  I once lived in such fear from these individuals that I once shoved a baseball bat handle up my rectum to quell the fear of retaliation. \n\nI was told at a young age that, yes, it is ok to not have a rite of passage, so long as you study hard and get the good grades. Now,  the ones I considered assholes are Doctor residents, analysts, and, lawyers. I was told at age eight that, it was okay to be suicidal enough to choke oneself out with a PlayStation 2 controller one day whilst stabbing oneself with a pencil remarking \u201cI want to kill myself.\u201d After all, let\u2019s not allow one to interact with society and let that person cope by watching films depicting hatred of society. I should know this. At age eight, I once indirectly advocated for an act of terrorism against an elementary school of mine. \n\nNot a single family member (immediate or extended) wants anything to do with me, period. When a sibling is raped, I do not know until a year-and-a-half after the fact. When texting to asking to talk, I am blocked. One day, I will sign a will handing my cousins a half-million when I pass after attending, the next day, I am a \u201ccocksucker\u201d who says \u201csob stories\u201d in response to an Aunt\u2019s hatred of me for identity differences.  I send a letter denouncing them, next thing you know, I am threatened with a restraining order. \n\nAt first, I assumed that the reasons behind it were the usually \u201cyou were abused like shit as a child,\u201d or, \u201ckids can be assholes.\u201d Part of it makes sense. However, I have noticed something. Maybe I am the utmost dirtbag and deserve the abuse of others. \n\nI have come to the conclusion that I am perhaps the most toxic individual you will ever meet.  I have become so disillusioned by humanity and myself that many things I have noticed. I have to be truly a real piece of shit for a rapist (my biological father) to refer to me as a \u201cpiece of shit punk.\u201d I have to truly do something wrong for an individual who molests their kid out of spite will label me as an accident, and, tell people that I have threatened to kill the family (I only want one family member dead, for very good reasons). In an age of society where commonality between sides is rare, ones hatred of me can be made public. Political parties. Community service groups. Divided families. \n\nIt takes a special kind of asshole to unite everyone under a cause. Even Dylann Roof and Nikolas Cruz had support from family members. \n\nI have told only one person this, but, my propensity to develop thoughts of harming myself and others came at the age of seven. To me, these thoughts have been so consistent and so prevalent that I have been used to them, akin to how one is used to breathing. For me, the thoughts (which have and never will be enacted upon) advocate for a quick death since, in my mind, the loss of conscious by my enemy is much better than prolonging someone in pain. They are not intrusive where they randomly enter the brain; nor are they detrimental and \u201cobsessive.\u201d They just exist.\n\nContrary to what may some have described when they label Amber Heard as \u201ctoxic,\u201d she is not toxic. She possesses wealth. She has fucked men such as Depp, Musk, and a woman. There are rumors of her hosting sex parties. If Amber\u2019s life is \u201ctoxic,\u201d that is a toxicity I would envy. \n\nThe reason why I will not go much further into anecdotes is, because, if I were to say about them, the absurdity and complexity would make my post \u201cbullshit.\u201d I could document abuse. I could document strange stories. However, no doctor or psychologist would believe what I say is fact. To them? Fuck off.  Who cares about my past? Other than to label me and hand me some medication that does not work. The time to randomly diagnose me (I have been diagnosed with about a dozen ailments from a mental part over my lifetime) will continue if forced into a hospital setting. \n\nI have attempted to take advantage of socializing with males and females in recent years. The problem is that, how I communicate and act shows toxicity. At one point, I would offer people tens-of-thousands in life insurance policies when I passed away to bribe them into letting me hang out with them. They declined. I would try to chat with a group on life, only to realize that I had no ability to associate, interact, or stick around. For me, the ideal human interactive experience is a Q&A session. After a period of chatting, a person usually is annoyed, or, wants me to leave outright. \n\nWhen it comes to attempting a romantic relationship with a human, I am zero. Romantic relationships, from what I have gathered, attempt to unite personality traits that two members of society have in common. I have not convinced a human in my life to go on a date with me because I am a dirtbag. At this point, due to my hatred of therapists and a realization that, at this point in my existence, looking back at past \u201cresults\u201d, no individual can teach me how to romantically court a human. \n\nIn order for me to obtain a \u201cromantic experience,\u201d I have to shell out $1,400 to someone whose personality lacks even a mask of anything, or, a \u201cboyfriend experience.\u201d One round of herpes later, and, I realize that my future ability to obtain any form of romance will have to cost significantly on my part.  While I hold a high view of the concept of males and females, I realize that I am probably destined to be unable to entice a human towards a hint of romantic feelings. \n\nContrary to the last paragraph, the bitterness is not of an \u201cincel\u201d mindset: I detest the misogynist who feels as though they have \u201cearned\u201d the right to sex; and that if not given, said incel feels determined to rape-and-kill. Rather, the bitterness stems from me attempting to interact with the opposite sex and realizing that I cannot, period.\n\nI detest the therapists that I have seen over the years. Some blonde thirty year old whose propensity to smile when once asking me \u201con a scale of 1-5, how are your purging habits today\u201d would spite me to continually vomit; and my decision to end such therapy caused me to stop purging. Another psychologist wanted me to do a certain type of therapy that did not work. I declined and asked for a different therapy. I could no longer be prescribed meds at the place. The same company who, upon a recent attempt of mine to try therapy again and failed, I will now inspire to denounce the health system as a whole.  There is no \u201cSean\u201d from Good Will Hunting, I have learned. \n\nAny individual is dispensable for the right price. I have learned this as a kid interacting with humans my age. Today, my public narrative of someone now has to change from \u201cgood folks,\u201d to a complex denunciation that, does not sound malicious (while said persons name will not be said in the narrative, the implication will target someone), but rather, sounds something that is accurate. I have to, from now on, change the narrative of someone I used to consider an acquaintance as someone who is now shallow as how I perceive 99.99 percent of humans to be.  Incidentally, during a nervous breakdown a couple of months ago, I warned this individual about me being worried about if my breakdown was more severe and this individual did not believe it to be the case. Of course, if anything would happen someday, this person is free to explain their side. \n\nThe problem is, I do not have a keen ability to interpersonal relations, that is, an inability to interact. Yes, there have been attempts to correct such as a kid. Things such as being unable to leave the house. A two-week social skills thing in third grade, etc. But, even in the year that I have attempted to interact, my ability to interact has been so apparently low that people will openly comment about it to other people in front of me. Many have questioned whether I am on a spectrum of sorts due to how I speak and talk.  I get spoken to as if I were disabled, or, a child. It pisses me off; and yet, for job reasons, I have to play the old Jay Leno \u201caw shucks,\u201d card to show a modicum of humility. \n\nThe fact is, I do not have a desire to socialize with the outside world apart from my job. Contrary to belief, I do not feel alone. I can write a 10,000 word essay on philosophy and Finance that no one reads. I once offered a woman $60 to read one essay \u2013 she declined. Nonetheless, if writing prevents me from developing thoughts, then so be it. \n\nI was offered a spot in a good state University. While academically, the proverbial \u201cknock out of the ballpark,\u201d will apply, socially, I will not fit.  I will piss everyone off. I know from experience that I will not delve into. Looking at this post, you, the reader, can predict the outcome. \n\nIn order to succeed in life, one has to have connections. I have a mind that has beaten the market over three years with what money I have raised; yet, not a single family member is willing to chip in a dime. I have been in both political parties, yet, when attempting to run for an office, I can let everyone know in advance, and, no one shows up. I can debate philosophy on why the atheist and the theologist\u2019s viewpoints on free will should be different, no one will care to read it. No one has read anything I send to them. What\u2019s the point of even writing. Who the hell cares? \n\nIn my view, the reason why I have not been institutionalized (via hospital or prison) is because, legally speaking, I have not committed any crimes; nor do I intend to. One cannot go to jail because said person is merely hated. If I do commit a crime, however, I would not be surprised if testimony from forensic psychologists would portray me as something as antisocial, narcissistic, and, malignant, a modern-day triangle of toxicity. An anecdote or two may state of how I once had four people in my life either (twice in private overheard, twice in public) legitimately believe that I would grow up to murder many individuals. While I do not wish to harm myself or others, if someone were to label me as that whilst a psychologist concurs, I am fucked. \n\nOne more thing, no therapist, no peer, no human has ever had the guts to tell me why I am so toxic in humanity\u2019s existence. I know that I am a piece of shit, detested by more than MTG at a Katie Porter for Senate 2024 rally in Los Angeles with Alexandria Ocasio Cortez. But for Christ sake, the only reasonable explanation is a woman\u2019s husband saying I am too blunt. Well if being blunt makes one universally hated, then to hell with humanity! No human has had any testicles to describe to me in ten minutes while I suck. Because contrary to popular belief, one can change on lengthy advice. I realized that I should not laugh at being abused; nor should I develop an obsession with \u201cTo Catch a Predator\u201d as some coping mechanism. But the fact that no singular person has told me why makes me spiteful. \n\nAt the end of the day, I am beyond redeemable. Therapy does not work. Medication does not work. Attempting to form interpersonal relationships with males and females has not worked. I am sending this because, I wish to warn others of the dangers of meeting an individual such as myself. Society should be grateful that there has been no catalyst to light my spark. Their best bet is to ignore me apart from essential interactions (such as when one such as myself attempts to eat at a restaurant). As long as I have my job and money continually flows in, I can take hatred from humanity and myself and confront the world on some perverse belief that, maybe, I still have a future beyond driving.  The day that I am let go, however.

When we were kids we were relatively close, we had a good friendship and bond. But when we started getting a little older he started being a horrible person. He was always mean to me and every interaction we had ended badly. Sometimes we would do something together and he would just end up making me cry. There was a period of time where my mum would go to yoga a couple of nights a week, and every single time I would cry and beg her to stay home because I could never bear hearing him and my dad argue. I\u2019ve always just had this subconscious need to protect him, which I hate, because I feel like he doesn\u2019t deserve it. When we were little he would take advantage of me being younger than him to be mean, but after we grew up a bit I\u2019ve always felt like the oldest because of how childish he acts, I can always relate to my friends complaining about their younger brothers for that reason.

My local community college has a foodbank, but it's only on Fridays from 10 am to 2 pm...my prime working hours. The last few times I was able to go, I was getting less and less each time. One time they gave me moldy bread past the expiration date. It's not their fault I know they're overwhelmed with people like me needing to use their services.\n\nI finally was able to go after my ex to pay child support and the court decided he's only going to pay $50 a week. When I told my mom (who was also a single mom, raising me) she said I should be grateful because \"she never received anything\" from my dad. Told me I was being ungrateful for what little I receive. She also told me I was an idiot for pursuing child support from my ex because he could \"take\" my daughter away when he's never even tried to be in her life. He's told me to my face he considers her a mistake and wishes he never f**ked me and he regrets forcing me to go without a condom. This measly child support is going to have to go to some after school care for my daughter because I need a second job just to deal with food being so expensive. I thought about stealing a pack of breakfast sausages the other day just so my kid could have something other than knock off cereal for breakfast. I've even thought about selling freaking feet pictures just to make ends meet but I know that isn't possible with my daughter in the apartment either. My rent is going up from $925 to $1250 in May, my apartment complex will no longer be paying for water so that's another utility I will have to manage, and they're upping the prices for the laundry unit from $2.50 to wash a load and dry a load to $4.50.

I didn't even have half of a box left so I just made sure my daughter could eat. She always tells me that school has better breakfast than what I have in our apartment.

We\u2019ve been married for 4 years and we have two kids (3y and 4m). He is a good father. I can\u2019t say he is a bad husband, but he isn\u2019t a great husband either. \n\nWe met when I was in my early 20\u2019s. We just clicked, he was good to me, he made me laugh everyday. There wasn\u2019t a day that was boring with him. He was still finishing his last year of college. I was already working. I got lucky and got a high paying job. We moved in together very quickly. After he got his degree, he couldn\u2019t find any work in his field. I was the one who paid for food and the groceries. Sometimes I paid his rent too. I took him out for dinners, paid for it, bought him presents. But I didn\u2019t mind. I saw how he was struggling and doing his best. He decided to find work in IT. He gave up his passion\/working in his field. He told me he wanted to make money so he could take care of me. IT was the safe way. I told him that he doesn\u2019t have to, i made enough money for the both of us. He told me that he loves me so much, he wants to do this for us. He wants to take care of me. \n\nHe worked really hard. He got promoted 2 times in a few years. We bought our first house. We got married and i felt like the luckiest woman in the whole world. He worked really hard. But he was too focused on his career. We had talks about it, he told me he would focus more on us. But life after settling down was different. We had our first child 3 years ago. He went with me to every appointment. But he was always on his work phone. He was there with me, but he was absent. \n\nMy husband got a lot of stress because of the high pressure at work. So he was on his phone a lot. We don\u2019t go on dates anymore. Even at dinner time he is on his phone working, or just browsing social media. I have to call him multiple times to get his attention. I have to remind him to put his phone away and to spend time with our baby. When he did put his phone away, he was there for us. He\u2019s really good with our child, our baby loves him soo much. I really cherish those moments. We had many talks about his absence after work time, because he was always on his phone. He told me he relaxes like that when he has too much stress, when he is on his phone he doesn\u2019t have to think. It became a habit. He told me he would do better and be there for us more. It went well for a few weeks but he fell back into his old habits again. \n\nFour months ago i gave birth to our second child. It wasn\u2019t planned. I have postpartum depression. The pregnancy was heavy. I did all the housework and i took care of our first child. I had bad thoughts because of the depression. I began to regret having this baby. I felt alone. I felt tired. My husband was barely there, too much focused on his career, too much time spending on his phone. It felt like i was burning out. It has been so long since i last went to the gym. I barely see my girlfriends anymore. \n\nI love my husband so much. The years we have been married I tried to take most of the burdens for him. He went on trips with his boys so he could relax. I was the one who took care of everything at home. I\u2019m the main care taker of our kids, I do the cooking and the groceries and I am the one who does the cleaning. Basically I do everything so our household can function. My head is full of to-do lists. I can\u2019t remember the last time i did something fun for myself. My head is working 24\/7 trying to take care of everything and everyone, except myself. I let myself go. I let myself down. I don\u2019t see the woman who was full of life and passion anymore. \n\nI finally broke down. I felt lost. I couldn\u2019t breath. It felt like i was suffocating. I love my husband and children soo much. But i forgot to love myself. My husband saw my pain. We had a long talk. He said he appreciates everything that I do. He admitted that he has a phone problem. He said he got lazy after getting used to me doing everything. He promised me he would do better. And I do see his effort. He is trying. But bad habits are difficult to break. I still have to remind him to put his phone away. I still have to call him multiple times to get his attention. I still have to remind him multiple times to help with the housework. \n\nAnd today he told me that next week he has to stay late at work for two days. I know that it can happen. I know that he has his obligations. I know that its work. But i just feel disappointed, sad and angry. I have to take care of two young children by myself. Its frustrating me. I don\u2019t want to feel like this. Maybe its the depression. Maybe i\u2019m just overreacting. I don\u2019t know. \n\nSince we got married he hasn\u2019t put any effort into our relationship. We don\u2019t go on dates anymore. He didn\u2019t get me anything for my birthday or mother\u2019s day. I have to remind him. While I was always thinking about him. Trying to make every special occasion special for him. \n\nHe is trying lately. I can see that. But he isn\u2019t trying enough. I promised him I would give him time. I promised him I would help him to change. But I am so tired. I feel like his mother because I have to remind him to put his phone away, to do the housework, to spend time with his kids. I just want to feel cherished. I just want him to be there for me. To help me. I\u2019m struggling. I have depression. I have to take care of my children. I have to take care of my husband. I have to do the housework. Soon my pregnancy leave will end and I have to go back to work again.

It's a painfully long procedure, but the benefits mentally are outweighing. I saw this one video where this individual undergoes 18+ cm of leg lengthening. He went from 5'2.5 in height to 5'10. His proportions after lengthening 7+ inches looks fairly balanced and in no way does he look like a \"t-rex\" with \"super short arms and long legs\". His arms remarkably look longer after the surgery, possibly because his wide thighs thinned out post-surgery. He also looks more proportional with the longer legs. This seems apparent in every other before-and-after LLS video - the patient's body ratio seems evened out after the surgery.\n\nI feel like LLS is a game-changing operation because it will literally solve anxiety-related problems for many people who don't realize height as their setback. If doctors can further advance this surgery, making hospitalization, rehab, and healing time shorter than a year, then this could be a win-win for both sides. More financial gains for doctors\/surgeons specializing in this field and speedier recoveries and discharge times for the patient. I am very excited about LLS and watching the field grow from the Ilizarov Technique, to the LON, and now Precise 2. I am imagining that a new method may develop in which an internal \"scissor lift\" device attached to the cut area of bone will be used for lengthening in replacement of the Precise 2 method. The \"scissor lift\" device will encompass a smaller area of insertion rather than a 10 inch metal rod drilled inside the hollow of a bone. Any advancements on this surgery is a definitive plus.","upvote_ratio":0.6,"created_utc":1678598437.0},{"title":"I want to die","author":"Mental_health896","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TrueOffMyChest\/comments\/11p5yz5\/i_want_to_die\/","text":"It sucks.

Idk if it\u2019s just me coping by ignoring the problem and hoping it gets better, but I\u2019m really struggling to care. \n\nI don\u2019t care about my stupid and irresponsible dad just as he didn\u2019t care to pay the house when we all know he had enough to catch up on his payments. He\u2019s many months behind and we\u2019re in pre-foreclosure. Everything is literally his fault and idk how he expects me to act like everything is okay with him when it\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t care about my mom, even though she has suffered and has been the victim in this 20 yr old suffocating relationship with my dad, bc she\u2019s never been there for me emotionally. She\u2019s used me as her personal therapist and has fucked me over because of it. She\u2019s always tried to force me to do what she wants or what she thinks is best when it\u2019s done nothing but restrict me and left me to hide my true self. I feel like I\u2019ve missed out on so much in my life because of her. \n\nI don\u2019t care about my younger brothers who literally go out of their way to annoy the fucking shit out of me. I genuinely think I deserve a gift from god for putting up with them and not getting violent. I could care less if they know about the family problems now, I\u2019m done trying to protect them from my parent\u2019s shit.\n\nI don\u2019t care about school, if I didn\u2019t have the self control I have now, I would\u2019ve dropped out last year. I don\u2019t care about my job or my coworkers even if I considered some of them my friends. They\u2019re annoying. \n\nOverall, I\u2019m selfish and apathetic, I don\u2019t care about everyone else\u2019s problems and I can no longer sympathize with them. I only care about my own comfort and if I could right now, Id disappear from everyone\u2019s life. \n\nI\u2019ve accepted this. I\u2019ve accepted that I\u2019ve become a bad person but it still hurts to think about sometimes. I just want to die alone at this point, maybe with my dog bc she\u2019s the only thing keeping me from going absolutely insane. Man I hate it here :\/\n\nAnd please don\u2019t tell me that LiFe gEtS bEtTeR!1!1!

I\u2019ve had self-esteem issues all my life. Dad said I had ugly legs because I have a lot of scars.

She said yes, was in a state of pure awe for over 20 minutes and loved all the effort to bits.**\n\nA little over a week ago, I posted here about how I have been proposing to my girlfriend for the past 6 months. Today, I've popped the question for real. \n\nWe had a rocky start of the day, but we eventually started our trek through Scotland. We'd rented a car with the intent of visiting the beautiful nature of the highlands. I was nervous the whole day and could barely sleep the night prior, and my inexperience driving on the left side and the roads being a bit tight here and there didn't help matters much either. \n\nAfter a few stops on the way up north, we eventually arrived at Altnafeadh, where, while she was taking pictures of the gorgeous landscape, including the vast plains, the imposing mountainside and this tiny white house to offset against it. (Look it up if you haven't heard of it. It's magnificent). \n\nAt one point, when she was with her back towards me to focus on the picture and the nearby area was devoid of other people, I got down on one knee and was ready to pop the question, trying (and failing) to use the line that I had conjured over nearly 180 notes. \n\nUpon turning back to me, she was in complete awe when she saw me, and could barely utter a single word after I asked the question, and just nodded instead (and followed it up with a soft yes). She mentioned to me after the shock died down that she didn't hear anything I said, only registering her name and the word 'marry'. \n\nHer face was frozen with this smile of utter disbelief once she put on the ring (which she absolutely LOVES). It took well over 20 minutes until she was able to speak cohesively again. We took some more pictures and videos before heading back to the car, where I could finally tell how she could have known for almost 6 months. \n\nAs I was telling her about the work I'd done, without giving away the solving method, you could see the wheels turn in her head. However, with the emotion and disbelief of the proposal still dominating her thoughts, her processing speed was very slow. Still, once she knew it was a puzzle she desperately wanted to solve it. \n\nAfter some more giddy talking and eventually driving to our next hotel, I provided her with the final clue again and some of the notes. I'd informed the hotel of my intents upon reservation so they'd been so nice as to set a congratulatory gift in the form of chocolate covered strawberries and more delicious fruit. Once she started solving, it took her a bit to understand but eventually she figured out how to solve the puzzle and it made her even happier. \n\nRight now, she's fast asleep cuddling up to me, exhausted from the tumultuous day, while I am writing this update for all of you and for myself to process it all as well. I feel like the luckiest man in the world.\n\nEDIT in advance: For those wondering why it's 180 and not 183 (half of 365): I asked 2 days early so I wouldn't be on edge the entire weekend and February is a thing.","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1678486980.0},{"title":"My toxic mom is asking me to help her when she grows old","author":"idk-foxs","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TrueOffMyChest\/comments\/11opa9u\/my_toxic_mom_is_asking_me_to_help_her_when_she\/","text":"TW- childhood trauma, homophobia.-TW i just really have to rant about this. she has always been very rude to me i can barley remember the most of my childhood and one of the only memory i have is her screaming at me to clean my room when i think about 4-6 or i had got soap in my eyes in a bath as a kid and she said to me to shut up.  another when i was about 11 or 12  i was extremely scared of car crash (still am) we where on a gravel road going to her boyfriend's house she wanted me to drive so y'know what she dose, she unbuckles my seat belt and after i got scared she yells at for not trusting her. i have one more because if i wrote the other one i would probably cry writing this (and i'm already tearing up remembering this.) when i came out to as a lesbian she thought i was joking and after she found out i wasn't joking she didn't want me to go to any of my friends that were girls because she thought i would have sex with them AT 12! yep and now i just need to get it off my chest if your still reading this please give me some advice and thank you so much. have a nice day or night and get a good resting.","upvote_ratio":0.86,"created_utc":1678554498.0},{"title":"Sick of Looking for External Validation.","author":"Samuri44","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TrueOffMyChest\/comments\/11p2wrk\/sick_of_looking_for_external_validation\/","text":"For the longest time I\u2019ve always been searching for others outside my family and closest friends for validation.

I can\u2019t wait too pour my love into this child and give her the best possible life that I can. \nBack In January at my 8ish week mark my husband and I went to go see my dad cause we didn\u2019t get to see him at Christmas (we live in different states). And the morning after our arrival while we were sitting and eating breakfast my dad kept making remarks on how \u201che\u2019s not pregnant buuuuttt. . . .\u201d And \u201cI\u2019m not a woman buuutt. . .\u201d Usually ending with \u201cwomen should only gain so much weight in pregnancy\u201d and \u201cwomen should only gain 20-30 lbs in pregnancy\u201d. He also kept making remarks on how big and fat my mom got in all of her pregnancy\u2019s (don\u2019t worry they have been divorced for y years now and have gotten remarried). Finally my husband and I went to his restaurant too see his new bar that he just had built and that\u2019s where he laid it into us. He told me that I was getting \u201ctoo big\u201d gaining \u201ctoo much weight\u201d and I was going to get gestational diabetes if I didn\u2019t take care of myself. Now to be fair my dad doesn\u2019t know that I ever had an eating disorder. I struggled with bulimia and then binge eating for a few years and I have been doing really well. I can stop myself from eating too much now and I have no urge to make myself throw up after every meal. As soon as we were alone I cried and sobbed. I called my mom and she made me feel better about my weight gain telling me that she was 260 with me and easily went back down too 140 after she gave birth. My husband wanted to intervene but I stopped him I don\u2019t like confrontation. The next morning we left as early as possible. My sister sent me a text message the next day telling me not to listen to our dad and that she thought that I looked BEAUTIFUL carrying another human. I shared it on FB and just said how much I had hated myself lately and how that her words made me feel better. But my step mom commented on almost with the exact same wording as my dad \u201ccareful though over eating will give you gestational diabetes\u201d and then I cried some more. Although this was a full blown panic attack. I actually had too throw myself into the shower fully clothed and turn on the cold water so that the cold water would make me gasp for air. . . . I\u2019m now 19 weeks and feeling somewhat better I still don\u2019t feel beautiful anymore and have a hard timing looking into mirrors.  But I\u2019m trying REALLY REALLY HARD to be thankful that I was blessed with a body that can do this. \nNow here is a curve ball Reddit. I\u2019m going on a cruise with my dad and family March the 20th. I have already been making mental notes of how I can tell him too fuck off with his remarks about my body in general and how I can avoid him. This will be my husband and i\u2019s first cruise so any tips on how to avoid him on the ship are appreciated and please leave your subtle \u201cfuck off\u201d remarks.","upvote_ratio":0.75,"created_utc":1678573718.0},{"title":"Ive been reported for DV by a narcissist.","author":"lonelydoormat97","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TrueOffMyChest\/comments\/11ox2od\/ive_been_reported_for_dv_by_a_narcissist\/","text":"Thow away account because i need some anonymity.  Also a first time poster so tips are appreciated.\nI 24f live with my friend 29f Mel (fake name). To paint some background. Mel moved in with me 5 years ago after her family sold her belongings without her consent. Over the last 5 years, we've become close due to many factors such as similar work roles, similar upbringings, shared interest in hobbie,  and a sound understanding of eachothers struggles. We both have CPTSD, anxiet,  and major depression. Although we are friends, we have built a home together, share a pet and  go on holidays together. Our friends refer to us as \"hetero life partner.\". I have also supported Mel with her mental health over the years by covering her living expenses ( approx $1700 per month) for the better part of the last 3 years while she focuses on healing from trauma. \nMel has a very unstable family, the typical nasty divorce of her parents (over 20 years ago), a father that went to prison for fraud and theft, a brother that abused her for years (emotionally, physically, sexually), her mother is also incredibly manipulating and generally lacks any form of morality. Mel is regularly told by her mother that family is everything and you must forgive them because 'no matter what  they love you'.\nNow that the background is painted, Mels brother scab (fake name) 33m, has been carrying on to Mels mum about our 'domestic relationship'. He has never liked me, probably because i asked mel not to give him a key to our place 4 years ago. I dont feel safe given his track record. \nScab has been telling anyone that I will listen that i am   manipulatative, i harm Mel, and i steal her money. As of a week ago, Scab has reported this to the police in the hopes that i cut contact with Mel. \n\nMoving forward, i dont know what to do. If police choose to investigate, could that come back to bite me? \nI know that Mel does not share the same views as her brother and has decided this will end their relationship.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678573552.0},{"title":"I cant let go of the past","author":"dumblonde6","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TrueOffMyChest\/comments\/11owpzv\/i_cant_let_go_of_the_past\/","text":"To keep it short and simple, i can not let go of something traumatic that happened to me.

Girls have like boxes for men that they check out and if u check out all of them then ur the one, its confusing. Anyway i loved her so much, she had an apartment and we were basically living together for like 3 months. i was buying her flowers, we had best sex as she said, (shes my first so ofc it was great lmao), we loved each other but i got blinded by love and didnt focus on what i should improve myself on, she tried helping me but i only cared about her and not me.... We break up like 5 months ago and she asks me if we can still be friends but i decide not to talk with her cus i cant stay friends with that kind of person that i love so much. We got in touch about 2 months ago cus we go on a same collage and we are door to door neighbors, few days before she was flying out to another country and was coming back on summer, i asked her to grab a coffee cus i still havent gotten over her at that point. She says se got a new man but bc shes going its nothing special but still they love eachother. I got 2 jobs, got my ass into collage by that point but i was still devastated at that point despite i had sex with 2 girls regularly but i still loved her. We followed eachother back on ig and i started feeling love towards her again and jealousy. She flew, i decided to mute her stories cus i couldnt look at them anymore and ignored her sending me tiktoks. After about a week ago she sent \"are u alive\" on tiktok and i said yea im busy with job and collage and didnt go on tiktok anymore... She decided to stike a convo on how i crashed my bike 2nd time and injured my knee and how dumb i am, she started going off on me how she doest want to text with me cus im acting \"edgy\" and how i dont know how to talk but i said \"thats how i talk to my homies lmao\" and she answers with \"thats not how u talk with the ladies\".... Then starts saying how guys there are so short and she cant fuck any of them blabla we stoped talking for couple od days. Today she sent a WhatsApp message saying \"u good?\"..... I was like wtf is she texing me now - i answered \"im great\" bla bla and we talked for a bit and she says again how there is not any guys there to fuck or have fun... Stuff like that and asks me hows my sex life, i ignore that and she says shes still kinda sad about her and the other guy breaking up and when she comes back it will not be the same cus \"people change in months\" and i said - people can* change - she answers with - feelings are not forever, do you still love me? - i got stunned and ignored that aswell.... Then she hits me with can we ft and says \"i want to talk about a lot of things with you\" and \"i miss being friends with you\"....and i said sure. We talk for a bit about her apartment, why i dont watch her stories cus she somehow noticed (i said im just busy), and some more basic shit. She mentions again how my sex life is and i say that im kinda busy but still get some from time to time, and shes like \"ahhh u fuckinnn\"......tf? Anyway i dont know is she playing any games, does she miss me, does she want to go back together, im confused.

I was diagnosed with Autism three years ago, which fundamentally changed a lot of things. To the better, and the worst. I am happier with myself now, knowing that nothing is wrong with me.\n\nOn the other hand, the ableism and the doors for absolute loneliness opened. I have no friends to meet, I am entirely by myself where I live. I am staying with my family because I simply can't afford a place to stay, and getting work has been tough. It feels like everyone runs away the moment they read \u201cdisability\u201d. Making friends online has also been extremely hard, don't get me started on that.\n\nI feel just very empty, no more life hopes left within me. Just going on day for day, and threading through what is basically an empty life. \n\nWhen my birthday was, nobody congratulated me, because there is nobody who can. I see people on social media I know through my interest in art, how they get to go out and eat food with their friends, get gifts and gratulations on their special day. While I spend it with my family, had some nice food, that was it. \n\nMy hobbies don't fulfill me either anymore, I do art and I went to art school until bullying made me leave, I made costumes, write stuff and game a shit ton. All of these things don't fulfill me anymore. They were my shining little hopes of light out there, where I would get my validation from. But there is none anymore. \n\nI slowly develop a social anxiety from being at home and unemployed for too long, trust issues due to bullying and having to quit apprenticeships because of that already. Going outside to a party is a no no, there are none in my bumfuck village, and socializing in general is a tough task for me, but I do try any time I can. It's not an excuse for me, being awkward but not trying and then complaining about no successes. \n\nAlso, people are often not talking to me anymore the second they find out I am socially a tad bit awkward, or just stiff and overall, Autistic. I also get mistaken for 16-18 all the time with my baby face and being downplayed, and just belittled, which is very humiliating when it happens.\n\nAll of these things just grow over my head lately, and I have no idea what to do other than vent it here. I can't get therapy because of the \u201cyou are Autistic, I can't help you, but you can pay 100 bucks an hour for a professional!\u201d. Like yeah, I have no job to even feed myself my guy if I had not my gracious family having a heart and letting me stay!\n\nNo friends, no validation from hobbies, and slowly letting the days drag me by has been getting too unbearable. Watching my Sister graduating, getting a place to study immediately, having friends and going to parties on the weekend, that was basically the fuel to the fire of my current emotional hole. I am very happy for her, that someone younger than me has an easier time out there (she is also not disabled or ill in any way, somewhat my opposite situation). \n\nAdding to that the Ableism seeping in from everywhere I try to apply, and things just get this much of a negative emotions cocktail. I don't know what to do other than be a soggy, sad washcloth on this sub.  Honestly, just talking about this made me feel a very tiny bit better. \n\nAnd no, I don't feel like leaving this world. I just can't do this to my family, so I basically have to live with this emptiness for the unforeseeable future. Or until I find something that gives me the validation and happiness back, to get through the depressing days like these.\n\nTo leave this on a slightly positive note, I found something I am going to apply, which might help me to get into my dream job somehow. It's being a freelance journalist in home office 20 hours a week, which is just perfect for me. Wish me luck this is going to work out, which would be quite the light at the horizon of shit for me.\n\nWell, thank you people in this sub in advance. I am going to try to sleep and read any potential replies later. This is my second account, because I didn't want to post this on my main and give away my identity to my gender or where I am from, or anything like that.\n\nGoodnight Reddit, have a good one!

I actually just woke up, again, from a bad dream surrounding the situation. Basically back when I was in high school around Senior year, (we were both 18) I was a virgin still. I was really interested in this guy and we got kind of close pretty quickly. He invited me to his house so after school we traveled there together. I was so nervous but kept telling myself it\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe get to his house and go up to his room. Basically, it\u2019s really awkward. In my head it seemed like he did this all the time so I was kind of expecting him to be\u2026. A little more smooth? Lol\n\n\nI get hit with the \u201cwanna make out?\u201d And so we do, for about a minute. I can tell he was eager to just get to the main event. So we undress and I lay down and he gets on top of me and nothing. He wasn\u2019t able to get in. I was so embarrassed and I was trying to focus on not focusing on it to help myself relax but nope didn\u2019t work. We try different positions and nothing. It was so humiliating. I bled too. We give up and we chill for a bit before I leave.\n\n\nNow that I\u2019m older, I know that 1. I have vaginismus (lucky me), and 2. There was absolutely 0 foreplay, and he\u2019s just as responsible as I was for the lack of this. I HATE how embarrassed I was at the time, I wish I could\u2019ve called him out on expecting me to be a slip n slide after one minute of kissing.

I say this because if this was a book or movie, no one would believe it. Either that or I am just a fool. Either is possible. \n\nMy adult son lives with us for a variety of reasons, but mostly he can\u2019t afford to live on his own. \nOur house is set us that we each have privacy. \n\nAbout 3 1\/2 years ago his girlfriend moved in with her 6 month old baby. She also had an older son that she lost custody of. She told us why and it seemed she was working hard towards joint custody. She told us that the baby\u2019s father had nothing to do with the baby. My husband and I watched her 3 days a week and her mother watched her the remaining time. It was strange to me because her mother kept her overnight and the girlfriend would have to go to her house to see the baby. \nHer hours at work were long and she often didn\u2019t get home until 3am. Living here helped them save money for a house. Or so I thought. \n\nFast forward a year and my son accidentally finds out that the babies father is actually involved and he\u2019s the one who has partial custody and he has her those days not her mother. My son and her had a big fight because the baby calls him daddy and she lied to him. They worked it out. \n\nFast forward again she is now about to turn 4. We love this child like all of our grandchildren. She\u2019s taken over our hearts and our lives. I can\u2019t imagine my life without her. \n\nThe girlfriend had a few career changes, but started working for the same company as my husband. She gets close to the people she works with. One of the girls my husband works near and her got close. One of the guys in that area and her joked and talked a lot. \n\nFast forward one more time to this week. My son finds out that she is fooling around with this guy. She said she loves him, packs up her clothes and our granddaughter and leaves without another word to him or to us. Our world was blown up. \n\nWe found out the guy is married and has a special needs child. He also has an older child that he can only see on supervised visits. But the real mind blowing thing is the girlfriend has a daughter that she lost total custody of and we had no idea she existed. She never told anyone about her. So, she has 3 baby daddies, 2 have custody and one has joint custody. WTF\n\nWhen I found out that she had a daughter that we never knew about, he left a wife and special needs child. supervised visits with the oldest child, I lost it. I texted her that she was the worst mother and she should be ashamed. She told her mother she\u2019s not suicidal but would blame me by name in a note if she was. I never contacted her again. \n\nShe hasn\u2019t seen the child since last week. Not even for her birthday. We gave her birthday present to her bio dad. Since then he\u2019s ghosted us. I guess he figures she\u2019s better off without us. \n\nMy heart hurts.

He's unsure if he is bicurious, trans, or just wants to crossdress\/be a sissy. He is very ashamed and does not communicate about it. How can our relationship work?\n\nLast night, I (21F) caught my boyfriend (24M) lying to me. He took 2 hours and 20 minutes to come home from his friend's house, when it should have been one hour. I asked him what took him so long, and he said he stopped for food, got gas, got a drink, had to stop to pee a bunch, etc.. I knew he wasn't telling the whole truth. \n\nI went through his phone and saw in his Apple Maps app he had been to a sex shop on the way home. He spent $99. I looked through his truck and saw an opened dildo package, lube, and in his room I found lingerie. I was super upset because he lied to me. I knew these toys were for him because I know he has a fantasy of performing oral on a \"femboy\" or trans woman. I know this because we've had begrudging talks about it before. He would talk to me about his desires if he was drunk\/high but was too ashamed to talk about it sober, ever. He would deny if I ever brought it up sober. But this was the first time I really had to accept he wanted to crossdress too. And I had to accept that these thoughts and feelings weren't just a simple kink that would just go away (I hoped). Not that I find it gross or unappealing, but I think it will be the reason I lose him. \n\nThe next morning I gave him a chance to come clean about visiting the sex store, and he denied it. When he found out I knew, he got very defensive about me going through his phone at first. But then he seemed super defeated and ashamed as I talked calmly to him about how lying is wrong in a relationship, usually no matter the reason. I was not really angry he went to a sex store and bought the toys, but I really wish he at least told me or did not lie. \n\nWe talked (mostly I talked, he was very quiet and could not look me in the eye) and he admitted he had been thinking about this fantasy involving trans women\/femboys and him crossdressing a lot this past week and just wanted to try something new by buying these toys. He wanted to see if experimenting with the lingerie and dildo would hopefully make his urges go away. He said he was \"figuring it out himself\" and wanted to keep it private. He said he was ashamed of these thoughts and feelings and really wanted them to just go away so he could be solely focused on\/happy with me. \n\nIn the first year of our relationship, I caught him on a dating app sexting trans women and crossdressing men. I have never trusted him the same since. I've tried to understand his obsession with these fantasies but he is not open about talking about it at all. whenever I ask he says the thoughts have gone away, but then when he's being honest he says he thinks about it all the time. Ever since then I've felt a looming feeling of anxiety, like there is something below the surface of our relationship waiting to pop out and destroy our happy lives together. And it's worse that he never communicates with me about it. \n\nDuring our talk I told him he needs to be honest with me. Transparency is the only way we could even possibly try to make this work. He said he really loves me and doesn't want to break up or go on a break. He said he just wants to satisfy himself on his own because he's not comfortable including me in this fantasy (I offered to peg him, experiment, etc.). He also reassured me he would not cheat and just wants to explore with himself. I told him, \"How do I know that?\" There's no way for me to be certain. Either he can repress these feelings and be unhappy until he can't hold it back anymore (and possibly cheats) or he indulges in them and finds out he wants to hook up with other people and experiment. He told me he doesn't want to hook up with anyone else, he doesn't want it to come to that point because he knows he'll lose me. \n\nHe really wants to make this work and so do I, but I feel like it might not be possible. I asked if he was trans, he said \"I don't know... No, I know I'm a boy, I just feel like I wanna be a girl sometimes. But I'm not trans, I wouldnt want to like walk around in public dressed as a girl, just sometimes in private.\" He fantasizes about receiving anal, giving oral, and crossdressing. I've seen videos such as \"Sissy Hypno\" in his youtube history. I really do try the best I can to indulge in his fetishes and fantasies myself, and I try to make him comfortable to experiment with me, but he's so ashamed and uncomfortable he can't. \n\nWe ended the talk by saying we would both think about what's best for him and I individually. I told him he *needs* to keep open communication as he's thinking because otherwise I'm in the dark and anxious and have no way of knowing the state of our relationship. He said he would think, and he'd try to keep open communication. \n\nIn my mind this could go a few ways:\n\n1. He chooses to focus on me and us rather than these emotions\/urges and they go away (unlikely, \"perfect world\" for me)\n2. He openly tells me he needs to pursue this and our relationship can't work, or I tell him I can't do it anymore\n3. He continues to not communicate and pretend things are find, tries to suppress his feelings so he can keep us going and keep me happy, until everything bubbles over again.\n\nI am unsure where to go from here. I'm hoping we'll have more talks and try to come up with some kind of solution because we love each other so much. We've been through a lot together. I've helped him clean up his life a lot and beat certain addictions and he's added so much spark and light into my life. \n\nAny advice of how to deal with this situation would be amazing.

I used to \"make youtube videos\". You get what I'm talking about.\n\nWell at the beginning of 2022, I was contemplating on killing myself becos I had been failing all my classes and felt like a dissapointment in general. My finals were coming up and I knew I wasnt gonna pass it and go on to the next grade. So I decided to just commit suicide. I had a bottle of sanitizer all ready to go.\n\nBut before I did anything I thought, \"why not just write the exam and then kms if I end up failing?\". \n\nNow, like i mentioned before, I used to \"make YouTube videos \" when I was a kid. At some point, it kind of became a coping mechanism. I was pretty lonely and all my friends were backstabbers so just being able to talk to the air felt amazing.\n\nSo coming back to the moment I thought of downing that bottle of sanitizer, I had gotten this million dollar idea. I was going to pretend like I had a stream that ran always. It would only stop on the day I die. Ofc it was only going to be a tiny thing, I was sure I'd fail my exams and I'd kms, so I didnt rlly think much of it.\n\nI ended up failing but I did pass into the next class due to some fortunate reason. From then on, this stream has stuck with me. \n\nI never rlly cared much about it. But somehow it evolved. Now I was getting atleast a million \"viewers\" throughout my whole \"stream\". From then on, every single thing I did, I was aware of it.\n\nIf I did smthng funny, my first thought would be the non-existent chat box going \"lolol she so funny pepelaugh\", or if I sang to myself I'd immediately think that everyone must be thinking I sing well.\n\nNow u might think I'm narcissistic, but my self-esteem is actually shit. I hate everything about me and think I suck ass. Hence this validation coming from a direction I didnt even know of was somehow exhilarating. \n\nAnd then one day I realised how fucked this stream had made my mind.\n\nMy mom, after 2 years of seeing her happy and content with life, came to me and started crying. She talked about how she was worried about me and my brother. I was failing my classes and my brother wasnt even going to his. She was extremely upset that we were breaking the one promise that we were to never break, to get bad in our studies.\n\nAfter she left, I was in absolute horror. The reason? Throughout the whole time my mom was crying, I was thinking of how I had to do better. How I had to make my mom feel better again. And then suddenly, another voice sprung up in my head and said, \"What a fucking hypocrite. You're only \"regretting\" your decisions so that you think your viewers pity you\". \n\nThey're not real. They never existed. They were just something I created to battle my loneliness. But somehow it had become real for me. \n\nEver since then, whenever I've cried, or regretted something, I would always be thinking about how horrible I am to act like I regret things in order to impress my viewers. Whenever I do something nice to another person, I think I'm a horrible person to act like I'm nice just for attention. \n\nI used to be someone who noticed little things and would act accordingly to it. Like a girl changed her earring, or a guy changed his cologne, and even doing small acts of kindness that I was taught by my parents to do towards others like opening the door, letting the younger ones walk in front of you to protect them, etc.\nBut now all I can think of when I do those are \"wow, hypocrite much?\".\n\nThey're not real so why the hell are they influencing my decisions. There's no need for me to think that I'm doing it for attention becos they dont even exist, but they still end up fucking with my head.\n\nAnd then one day, while I was crying, I decided to vent to my \"stream\". I was talking about how hard things were getting in life, all while fighting the thoughts that popped up in my head that said I was a horrible to person to milk sympathy out of people. At one point I was talking about how lonely I was getting and I said, \"And it's so hard when you don't have friends. Even you guys...\" and then I stopped.\n\nI couldnt say it. I couldn't say it out loud. I couldn't say they didnt exist. That they were just a figment of my imagination. I just sort of sat there in silence, staring off into a corner of my room. There was absolutely no thoughts in my head except the words \"Hypocrite\".\n\nI know I should probably talk about this to someone, but I'm someone who would rather bear the heat than to tell the devil that hell is a bit hot and it kind of hurts. I fear ranting to people cause I know it'll chase them off. I'm not an attractive person and my cheerful personality is the only reason I have friends. I'm scared of opening up to even my family. \n\nEven as I type this out, my head is filled with thoughts like \"Wow look at the hypocrite try to get internet likes\", \"fake ones weren't enough so now you want sympathy from real people?\" \n\nI just want it to stop and I wish I never started this damn stream in my head.

I feel like I do such a great job at work and that I\u2019ve gotten really good at what I do and then to end it seeing that I only got $2 makes me so sad and incredibly unappreciated. \n\nThe other day I worked with all managers so all the tips would go to me and we were so busy that day but I didnt mind it because I knew at the end I was gonna be getting more tips. Towards the end of the day, this family came in and he saw I gave him a little bit extra (I tend to give extra towards closing to avoid tossing as much as possible) and he was so happy about it he gave me $10 in tip and I felt so good making their day from just a little bit of extra food. Anyways, I ended up receiving $20 in tips that day meaning if that family didnt tip me $10 I would\u2019ve only earned $10 in tips despite having such a busy day and it just felt bittersweet really. \n\nEverybody tells me to find better which I understand but I\u2019m hesitant because I love how good I\u2019ve become and I have fun doing it because I love my co workers but at this pay I don\u2019t think it\u2019s even worth it anymore. The worst part is that no matter how well I do I\u2019ll still be paid the same as the people who slack off and barely do what we need. \n\nAnyways thanks for reading this if you did.

We both are not from this city, her family only lives an hour away and mine are 7 hours away (driving).\n\nOur friendship has struggled since moving in together, for example, there was a month when she refused to turn off the heating leading to us getting a \u00a3700 heating bill (this has still not been resolved and we just have this debt hanging our heads as she refuses to do anything about it) as well as I disagree with her relationship with her boyfriend (30M) for many reasons including the relationship has moved incredibly fast in 3 months, that she now mostly lives with him, this month (February) she has slept at our flat 2 nights. We haven't spoken (if you don't include me sending her tiktoks and asking when she'll be home) or seen each in 2 weeks. The last time we spoke, I told her that my mum (55F) was incredibly sick and had been rushed to the hospital days prior where the doctors had no idea what was happening but were suggested cervical cancer and they took blood, scans and a biopsy to make sure. She left hours later to go on a walk to clear her head and I haven't seen her since. She told me yesterday that she will be living with her boyfriend for a bit.\n\nI know that she has had quite a lot of family issues recently as well. There are 3 generations that live together and they can't decide who owns the house now that they plan to sell it. Although I am understanding that this has been difficult for herself and her mother, I can't help to think that mine needed a little more support from someone who is supposed to be my best friend.\n\nMy mum has been sick my whole life, she had a devasting stroke 10 years ago. Most recently she has been experiencing what we thought were chronic fibroids, which has caused her to have continuous bleeding, stomach aches, and passing golfball-sized blood clots for the last 2 or 3 years. Every doctor said it was just fibroids and that it was this bad for some. Last week, my mum has rushed to the hospital again, this time the doctors were prepared to say that it was, in fact, cervical cancer, they still needed to wait for the biopsy but they will perform a hysterectomy. A surgery that they said was too high of risk only weeks ago.\n\nDuring all this, I've only had my boyfriend to rely on for support. It has been the hardest week of my life, I have never felt so sad for another person before. I love my mum to bits and I can't cope to be a 7-hour drive away from her.\n\nI have looked into universities closer to home that I could transfer to and there is one a 2-hour and a half drive or a 2-hour train from my mum's, my little sister (16F) also wants to move to that city too to study so we have planned that if they allow me to transfer, we will get a flat together. My boyfriend agrees that we will be able to make it and see each other every other week.\n\nThe only problem is that I haven't told my flatmate, I have tried messaging her and our group chat with a mutual friend saying that things aren't going well with my mum and that I've been feeling incredibly depressed. I haven't told them that my mum has cancer, mostly because it feels beyond insensitive or ingenuine to have to tell my closest friends over text that my mum has cancer. Neither of them has tried to reach out. In fact, they have been together, in our flat without me. Even joked about how they were at the flat and I wasn't here, that things can't be too bad if I was able to go to uni and work. Both of them know that I have depression, am medicated for depression, in therapy for depression and that this depression is mostly caused by neglect I experienced growing up due to my mum's stroke and mental illnesses. I feel completely neglected by this friend. Completely disregarded. I don't feel that I should have to chase her again to tell her that my mum has cancer and I will be renewing the lease on our flat. She won't be told until I'm ready to tell her. But would that make me an asshole?\n\nupdate:\n\nIt's been a week since this initial post, I am still yet to see or talk to my flatmate properly. However, a lot has happened, more than I could ever have predicted a week ago. Basically, it's the worse possible news for my mum, her condition has declined a lot as in continuously has been sedated and given morphine as the pain is unbearable and half the time morphine doesn't even touch it and she has also not eaten in days. The cancer is no longer localised, and the hysterectomy will not cure the cancer, it will prolong her life and hopefully get rid of most of the pain she is in at the moment, which the doctors expect roughly a year if all goes well with the hysterectomy on Wednesday. She has refused radiation and chemotherapy. It's an incredibly high-risk surgery, the recovery will be months, and she could possibly never fully recover. I'll be flying up to see her before and after surgery. Before, coming back to move out of the flat by the end of the month. I've spoken to the landlord, who has allowed me to sublet the flat\/ find a replacement so I posted an ad, someone is interested and can move in at the start of next month. My dad has a flat in the city I will be moving to so I'm all good, I just gotta wait until the tenants' lease is over and then I will be moving in. I started to make the arrangements to move, move my things into storage, cancel bills in my name, cancel our joint bank account, everything is a lot. There's so much more to do. I messaged my flatmate saying that I will be going home at the end of the month, and her response was 'okay have fun'. I said 'I won't be coming back to the flat, someone will be taking over my room'. She called me an hour later sobbing, demanding 'how could I do this to her? she doesn't want to live with a stranger that I'm a terrible friend and flatmate' etc more and more for about 2\/3 mins, I simply responded with that she 'has been a stranger to me for months now and I don't want to live with a stranger any longer'. She sobbed, and balled until I hung up, I felt like I was making the biggest mistake at that minute, I almost cried myself until I realised the complete silence, that nobody was here for me, nobody important that my mum is the most important person to me and that I needed to be with her for her last year of life. Her last birthday, her last Christmas, her last holiday, her last everything. Nothing was more important.\n\nINFO: My flatmate was planning to leave the flat to work full time over the summer in her home city, starting in May. She is also currently living with her bf for a 'bit' although I don't know how long, she would not be 'living' with a stranger.\n\nMy heart is broken, shattered. I feel so numb, my heart is the only thing that provides me comfort with the feeling that I am still alive, surviving through all the heartbreak rn. I'm mourning not only my mum but my friendship, the city that I loved a few weeks ago, and the life I had with my amazing boyfriend, oops I mean fiance. I do have amazing friends here, I have never felt so loved... or pitied. I've been given endless flowers, hugs, kisses and tears on behalf of my mum and me. I almost felt bad having to throw out my flatmate's dead flowers her bf gave her for valentines that she shoved into one of my vases and left to die. I somehow have managed to allow myself to have some excitement for the next year, my family and I have a lot planned to make this the best year of my mum's life. I could cry that my mum will be able to go wedding dress shopping and walk me down the aisle. Yes, my bf and I are young and possibly stupid but it was my mum's wish and my bf adores her as if she was his own mother. Even if the marriage doesn't work, especially since it will be long distance, I will have photos and memories of my mum at my wedding. In the end, I'm happy with being the asshole, I have made peace that I am the asshole. She will have to 'live' with a stranger for a few months, not knowing why I left, she never even asked or let me say but I will be losing my mum forever in a few months so I'll be the loser too in the end.\n\nNow:\n\nEverything feels like a lot at the moment, there's so much to do regarding, transferring universities, moving flats, job hunting, looking after my mum, and being there for her alongside dealing with family members that are being cunts about my mum, absent friends and everything else. It's a lot. I tried again to reach out to my friend\/flatmate that I wasn't sure when I'd be back and that I missed her and all to which was no response. I facetimed our mutual friend, I told them everything, we cried, we laughed, and we sat in silence for a while afterwards. It felt good to tell someone and we agreed that it was better to tell my friend in person what was happening but the chances feel below low. I feel completely alone, even though I'm surrounded by family, and old childhood friends. But I'm over 400 miles away from the flat I love that has all my belongings, the part-time job I love, the university I love, the city I love and my boyfriend and friends that I love most. I feel like that part of my life ended long before it was supposed to. In so many ways, I don't know how I'm supposed to go on with life rn. I don't want anything to change, I wanna go back to how life was when it was lively when everything felt like it was fitting perfectly into place. Nobody seems to actually understand what I'm going through, all anybody says is that \"life has to change sometimes\", \"everything has changed for everyone\", and \"everything will work out in the end\" or that I should be happy not that the worse part of my mum's treatment is over. But everything can't magically fall into place again, not with my mum gone. It feels so unfair, I know that my mum has it worse than everybody involved rn. She doesn't deserve any of this. But I can't help to think that it's bad enough losing my mum without losing my entire life with it. I want to be there for her, but I've also made my life in a different city 400 miles away which has now fallen to pieces, my friend\/flatmate would rather avoid me by living with a 30yo man than support and comfort her best friend of 3 years.

We did that a few times but i never thought much of it because i think i just liked all the attention i would get from other kids in band. Its a small school, so everyone knew, especially teachers. I did that sticker thing a few times. He would always take them down and leave hints that it made him uncomfortable but i never picked up on it because i was so wrapped up in what everyone else thought of it.

I asked her how she thought he would feel about it. \nShe basically said that she thinks he would think its funny, but be uncomfortable about it.

I mean from small things like being forgetful all the way up to straight up being inattentive, ever cycling thoughts, hyper focus and the symptoms have been very prevalent but ignored through my childhood. I was called lazy I was called a quitter when I would start things like a hobby and quit after you know not really getting into it. I really started to think that I couldn\u2019t do anything right. Basically not knowing about my ADHD made my childhood kind of hell. Everything that was actually an ADHD symptom or behavior was what I usually got yelled at for. Too many water bottles in my room? Screamed at. Forgetting to take my rooms trash out? Literally came home to it dumped in my bed. Walk a little too loudly on the second floor because I was excited(I was 7 or 8)? Got my ass beat (by my step dad). \n\nIn 2020 I spoke to my primary care physician and actually had to convince her to give me a referral to get tested because she didn\u2019t believe I had ADHD (because seeing a person once a year for a 20 minute physical means you really know how they behave daily).\n\nWell fuck her, I was right and I was diagnosed inattentive ADHD, with sides of depression and anxiety and now after going to multiple therapy sessions we\u2019re also thinking possible BPD and a dash of cptsd. \n\nNow, I love my mom, don\u2019t get me wrong. She is one of the few things that has kept me on this earth this long (she is my only family). However anytime I talk about having ADHD she blames my symptoms on my zodiac chart. \u201cYou have a lot of air placement\u201d she says. This isn\u2019t to knock anybody that believes heavily in astrology, but the fact that she can\u2019t even admit her part in my shitty childhood and instead just blames it on astrology pisses me the fuck off. And the thing is I\u2019m pretty sure astrology is just her current hyper fixation because she\u2019s only recently gotten deeply into it. I haven\u2019t said anything to her about this because I know that she cares a lot about astrology and and is very heavily into it to the point of getting tarot readings from a lady in a purple wig at a random expo. But just the fact that I\u2019m now having to go to therapy for a lot of the shit I got to go through as a kid (that was contributed to by her), and she won\u2019t even admit it, is infuriating. I\u2019ve talk to my boyfriend about this and vented my frustrations but it\u2019s just one of those things that almost comes up every time I go to see her. So it\u2019s not even like a one time mention. She talks about my astrological chart every time I see her and say that\u2019s 100% why I am the way I am.

Throwaway account. I\u2019m living in a foreign country, and I\u2019ve made some friends and have been casually dating. Last Saturday, one of my fwb (P) invited me to celebrate his birthday w him and his friend group (an fairly even mix of men and women ) that he\u2019s known since uni. I\u2019ve known him since December. We\u2019ve hung out and hooked up a couple of times, and we chat every once in a while. \n\nI meshed well with the group, even had a deep convo with one of the girls about life. We drank, we danced, it was tons of fun, and nothing out of the ordinary for this city.  Eventually we all went back to P\u2019s house, and it was along the way there that things started to get fuzzy.  I had been dancing all night with in of P\u2019s friends, and when we got to the house idk why or how but we decided to sneak into the bathroom and hooked up. I remember all of that and I remember P knocking on the door that the party was moving to a different location.  \n\nAnd then I don\u2019t remember much else. I remember walking and my legs weren\u2019t working right. I kept falling. And then that\u2019s it. \n\nI woke up in my bed, naked, and there was a note on my work desk that said \u201cYou\u2019re too beautiful \u201c in a foreign language (not the native one here or English) that the whole friend group speaks and so do I. \n\nI woke up at nearly 3pm, which is totally unlike me no matter how much I drink. \nThe more time has passed, the more in realizing that I didn\u2019t drink that much to be falling down drunk.  And then last night it hit me: they drugged me and raped me\n\nDuring the week I had tried to reach out to P to piece things together and he was really evasive about things, which is what made me really suspicious. \n\nI just wrote him this morning to be honest with me because things aren\u2019t adding up and I\u2019m thinking all kinds of bad things. He said he would pass by to talk in a few hours. \n\nI needed to get this off my chest because I am not ok right now\n\n\n\n\n\nUPDATE: P gave me almost no new information. He couldn\u2019t meet up so we spoke on the phone. \n\nStory goes: We went from his house to a nearby bar in a car. P and I live about 15 walking distance from each other btw, bar was a halfway point. \n\nAt the bar I was falling down and the guy I hooked up with in the bathroom said I was in really bad shape and needed to go home. \n\nThe driver took me and the guy to my house, and came back to the rest of the group at the bar without the guy. \n\nThe guy told P that he left my house at 9 am.  P says he hasn\u2019t spoken any types of particulars w the guy because he\u2019s married, which is also why the guy doesn\u2019t want me to have his contact info. \n\nI told P there was no way it was only alcohol that got me like that and he tried to blame it on the fact that I had smoked some weed\u2026 He just kept saying he didn\u2019t anything about that and his friends aren\u2019t like that and  \u201csometime\u2019s alcohol effects you differently on different days\u201d. It felt a little gas-lighty \n\nI am torn on whether or not to believe what he\u2019s saying is true. \nOn the one hand, It\u2019s entirely possible that I was drugged by someone else that wasn\u2019t in our group, and dude just took advantage of what he figured was a VERY drunk woman. I\u2019ve been randomly drugged in the USA before, and I had the same: \u201cwait, I didn\u2019t even drink that much, how did I get so fucking drunk\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, P\u2019s friend could have drugged specifically to rape me and P doesn\u2019t know anything about it. \n\nAnd the third option is that P is lying about what happened after we left his house, and that\u2019s where the nightmare fuel starts. \n\nIf P\u2019s story is true, then the awful things I was imagining didn\u2019t happen. I was imagining being unconscious and being gang-raped by all the guys in the friend group. Maybe even the girls are there recording it and laughing or something. I don\u2019t know. \n\nIf it really was only the guy there, then it would have just been him raping me. Even if he didn\u2019t give me any drugs, he new I was unable to consent by the time I got home. I don\u2019t know if that happened or not, and it doesn\u2019t look like I will get an answer for it. \n\nThe anxiety levels have gone down a bit.  I\u2019m going to choose to believe P\u2019s story for my own sanity.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678562261.0},{"title":"I (18F) am tired of being considered strong because I'm not.","author":"anony_throwawayy","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TrueOffMyChest\/comments\/11os8a1\/i_18f_am_tired_of_being_considered_strong_because\/","text":"All my life, I've played the role of the 'strong' elder sibling, the 'strong' kid, classmate, friend, everything. Not physically, but mentally and emotionally. Even when I was just a kid, I was expected to take things easier than others would. \n\nIt started with me being heavily abused, physically and verbally, by my grandparents from a few months old to 3 years. It made me a scared kid, too terrified to express anything. And I think due to that I cut myself off people. I didn't express many feelings, didn't express displeasure or happiness. Just a quiet kid who mostly showed terror, if anything. That somehow fit in my mom's brain as me being 'strong' and needing less emotional and mental assistance than normal kids. I don't blame her, she had a lot going on in her life, too. \n\nWell, the image stuck and my dad left for 3 years when I was 4 without any warning to us kids (my brother and me) and it fucked me up a bit because he was the person I was closest to. I was devastated, confused, and had  so many questions but I never asked. I stayed quiet and accepted it. I honestly got to know where my dad was after a year and a half had already passed with him being absent. So, this put the stamp on the notion that I did not feel. I did not need any sympathy, condolences or anything of the sort. No emotional talk or anything. Because I was strong. \n\nThe 3 years with my dad absent were some of the most horrid ones. I lived with my mom and her side of the family. They all (my mom's 2 uncles, and father, along with their respective families so around 11 people and the neighbors) lived in the same locality and were fiercely close. I was a quiet kid, like I mentioned and a terrified one. New people scared me. I remember I'd scream and hide behind my dad whenever the bell rang as a kid. But he wasn't there anymore. So I stayed quiet. I didn't talk. Those people are big on talking. They're lively people, I'm not. Never was, never will be. But my brother was and he still is. He would talk, engage with them, he was friendly and most of all, he behaved like a kid. He was fun to hang out with. And since there were no other kids in any of the families, he became a favorite. I had nobody to talk to unless my brother decided he wanted me there too. Even then, I was mostly ignored by everyone except my brother. But I managed. \n\nThat ignorance and the loneliness from age 4 to 7 kind of fucked me up. I became heavily insecure about everything. I opened up a bit, wanting people to like me, but it got made fun of. I guess they were mostly jokes but they hurt. Still do. And I remember my attempts at socializing are still jokes there. They still laugh and remember awkward or embarrassing things I did as a kid and make fun of it. I just remember a terrified 5 year old trying too hard to be liked. Anyway, the plan failed miserably and I wasn't liked. At all. \n\nSo, the insecurities kept adding up until finally my dad was back and we moved. I had never been happier to get out of any place as I was then. But my mom and brother would miss that dreaded place dearly and we visited there almost every weekend. And as my dad dropped us off, I'd cry throughout the ride. I said it was because I didn't know how he would manage alone but it was really because I could not imagine setting foot there again. But I had to. I managed better this time because atleast I was with dad for 5 days. \n\nThe thing is, getting treated as if he was royalty for 3 years got to my brother's head. He kind of became a jerk who expected that everyone should treat him like a prince. And instead of making him learn a lesson, my mom decided it would be good to tell kids in the new neighborhood to treat him better than others because he had come from a new place. They did that, they were just kids too. And me being an awkward, terrified little girl at the young age of 7 years, again did not talk a lot. I didn't make many friends, not any I'd ever remember or miss. He did, however. \n\nBut soon enough, after a year or two, the misery ended. We stopped visiting that place every weekend and visited twice or thrice a year. However, my quiet nature had been formed. So as I went to school, I didn't talk. I quietly cried most of the time because I was heavily bullied when I was 7-8. But that improved too when I made a friend. She was a good friend, not someone I ever miss though. But she did make things a bit better. However, I still felt like an outcast, I have always felt a bit out of place no matter where I am. So despite having friends, I didn't talk much. But that was okay. \n\nThis quiet nature was now taken as 'strong'. As I got older, I stopped going out of my house, I didn't go down to any park even though my brother left every day to meet his friends. But I think it was okay. It wasn't, however. I learnt to internalize everything.\n\nThen we changed schools when I was 10 and I think that is the next best thing that happened to me. I loved the new school, it felt like a new start. I could make up a good personality who people would like for the first time in my life. So, now I started speaking a little. Opening up, I'd talk but I was too hesitant to actually 'open up'. I learnt to talk but I also learnt to selectively give information. I learnt to internalize my thoughts and feelings because I had friends who would want to know things about me. Things I don't want them to know. \n\nSo, my 'strong' nature continued and I was 'stronger' than ever. Never sad, never affected by anything at all and me crying became a big thing for I rarely allowed myself to. But I made a friend, I love her so much and I would definitely miss her if I ever lost her, and I confided in her. I shared things. I think she is the only one who knows how not 'strong' I am. But to the others, I was very strong, very happy and always preppy. \n\nI became a lively person, one who was always smiling and laughing and talked to a lot of people, super extroverted and fun loving. Invited to lots of parties, being a part of the 'cool' people group. It was a good time. I was rotting on the inside. \n\nMy early teenage years were when I mastered hiding emotions. I remember having too many bad days in a row and I had an ear infection when I was 12. My brother was yelling as loud as he could to make my ear hurt after I had told him not to and I begged my mom to make him stop, she didn't care. I started crying due to the pain and he finally stopped but since the crying wasn't only because of the pain, I took that as an excuse to cry about everything that had happened. I cried for over 20 minutes sitting in the same room as my brother and mom and neither bothered to ask if I was okay. Well, my mom finally got up and said, \"Why are you crying? I've never seen you cry. You didn't even cry as a kid, you're too strong.\" And that was when I decided I would only cry alone, if ever. \n\nAnd I cried. A lot. I cried myself to sleep wishing I was dead with my mouth covered using my hand more times than I can recall. I'd even get excited to go to bed so I could cry. It was a dark time and that is when the depression hit. It hit hard. \n\nBut I was 'strong' to everyone else. I never cried, I was always preppy, always jumpy, always energetic. I came to high school and it hit bad. I went from a straight A's student to having some B's in my report card, got yelled at for them by my parents (mostly mom) and it was a shitshow. \n\nI do not know how I survived the freshman year. The sophomore year was better at the start but by the end, it crumbled me. I would cry before putting on clothes to go to school and cry after coming home while changing out of them. It was a very bad time. I remember confiding in my mom once when I cried all day before an exam and she told me, \"Don't study. Leave it. I can't see you crying, you're too strong, the last time you cried was years ago!\" and once again, I had to be 'strong'. \n\nYears have passed and I've justified my 'strong' image. I don't cry, but I've slowly been going back to the quiet, terrified 5 year old I was and the whole world feels like that town where I was ignored. \n\nThe 'strong' nature has messed me up so bad that I feel like I wasn't allowed to be weak. I'm still not. My brother would cry and throw tantrums routinely. However, I was 'stronger' so I didn't cry. I've cried twice in my whole life according to my mom and I've never cried according to most of my friends. I wish I was allowed to be weak because I am. I'm not strong, I never was. I was a terrified kid who was forced to be strong by giving constant reminders that I was strong. \n\nOne day, I wish for one day where I can be weak. As weak as I want to be. Because I am weak, I'm not strong, I am a liar who has convinced everyone that I am so when I'm not. I never was.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678561693.0},{"title":"I am so tired of seeing sexism in some of the subreddits","author":"gylotip","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TrueOffMyChest\/comments\/11oxnt2\/i_am_so_tired_of_seeing_sexism_in_some_of_the\/","text":"I was reading some subreddits, and they are literally hating each other's guts, like sexism after sexism.

That is the best way to explain it. They really love and cherish my elder brother (19M). My mother (50F) especially, she is mentally, emotionally and physically abusive. However, she always treated my brother gently. No matter what he did, she supported him and loved him. To me? She takes out anger on me. Someone had a fight with her? She beats me up. Or any sort of anger at that place.  \n\n\nMy brother and mother are very close. So my brother justifies my mother's actions as that I am not being emphatic enough to understand it. However, I don't think I can be emphatic to someone who never showed me love.   \n\n\nMy father (55M) is straight out fucked up. He was a little bit abusive to my brother too. And he is abusive to my mother a bit too. But to me? He makes me want to go kms. He took out the lock of my door because I locked it like my dude???   \n\n\nI am not given the least bit of privacy in this household. Like my brother and father were discussing how to install anydesk into my phone. And I won't be going to details in quite a few things because thinking of those make me want to cry but you can ask me if you rly want (It will be okay because I think I would have calmed down by then).  \n\n\nSo anyways, I have always been the \"punching bag\" of the family. And whenever I talk about my feelings, they either ignore me or start beating me up and blaming me. And they try to act loving and shit too because:  \n1) They must protect their pride to their siblings (My grandparents are dead) and friends  \n2) To manipulate me  \n\n\nI unironically had to make my doctor (Not a therapist btw) interfere with this bs because they do not understand. They literally hid my phone because I was texting someone \"too much\". And whenever I express my anger on them, they just go: \"SO YOU'RE ANGRY ON WHOEVER TF YOU ARE TEXTING AND TAKING OUT YOUR ANGER ON ME???!!!\"  \n\n\nLIKE DUDE YOU CERTAINLY WEREN'T THERE FOR ME WHEN I ALMOST KMS LIKE THAT PERSON HAS KEPT ME HAPPIER THAN YOU EVER EVEN TRIED TO???????????????????  \n\n\nAnd to worse it off, my parents are proud of themselves when I cry.  \n\n\nAnd the insane part is, I am unironically going mentally ill. After 13 years of this shit, a snap happened in my head. I started to have voices inside my head (They are not usually that very violent). Whenever my parents beated me up, I started beating them back. That is the only reason the beatings got a bit lesser and they started resorting to emotional abuse.  \n\n\nBut I scared. I am scared that it will end up getting worse. Either resulting to su-cide or m-rder. But I don't want to do either. I also wish I could love my family. But I just cannot anymore.   \n\n\nBut there is still hope, because when I turn 17 and go to college, I will get to move out. But I don't know if I will be able to hold on that long.  \n\n\nTo be worse, it is taboo in my country to talk about mental health. And I proposed therapy to my parents AND THEY FUCKING LAUGHED  \n\n\nPS I have always been scared to tell people because they consider 13 yr old to be children and disregard their problems so this one of the first times I am properly venting.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678553391.0},{"title":"Why am I always feeling like a burden to my family?","author":"RyujinS_Tokkii","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TrueOffMyChest\/comments\/11oxm1f\/why_am_i_always_feeling_like_a_burden_to_my_family\/","text":"English is my second language so I apologise for any mistakes, I also apologise for the really long post, but once I started writing was it like I couldn't stop. I'm not from the USA, so me being in uni is normal here and we go from elementary (8 years) to high school (4, 5 or 6 years).\n\nEdit: I don't wish for this to be shared on any videos\n\nMy (17F) family life is complicated. My parents divorced when I was 11 and my little brother \u201cJay\u201d (now 13M) was 7, they had been on a break before and got back together. This time, however, they didn't get back together. My mother had used me during the divorce to get more days with my brother and me, I have been told that she only wanted us to go to my dad when she needed to work and that he needed to be home when we were there, making him unable to work. It had worked at first, but in the final agreement, a 50-50 split was decided, with the change of responsibility over us at Monday 12.00h. At first, everything was fine, there were slight digs at each other's families here and there, but most things were okayish, but I could feel the difference in primary custody. My dad had primary custody over Jay, while my mother had it over me.\n\nMy grandma \u201cAnne\u201d was helping dad out when we were younger, she would come over every day around lunch so we could eat at home and would stay till after dinner, often she even made dinner and cleaned up afterwards. Something I'm not proud of is that my dad nor my mother ever let me or Jay do chores, mother didn't like it cause we would walk in her way, be too slow or didn't do it the right way and dad barely did any chores at that point in time (from what I saw). My grandma kept the house running and she took over a lot of the housework, with the exception after I went to high school at the age of 12 of my room, which was my responsibility. My dad complained a lot about how she did things, and that she did chores on days he didn't ask for them to be done and that there were more important chores to be done those days (I now have the insight to see that he shouldn't complain on grandma and taken responsibility for it himself if she didn't do it correctly, but she took all his complaints and never changed anything about when she did things). After grandma stopped coming over every school day, my dad changed. Where we barely heard about the divorce from him, was it now a topic he constantly talked about and couldn't leave alone most nights for some reason? A lot of dinner conversations excited around the divorce, on how mother wanted too much for everything, and how her family was bad and that they didn't care about us, my brother and I, on the state of the house after we left and on how my mother's family treated him that he thought was wrong.\n\nMy mother had a whole different tactic to the divorce, she talked about it a lot from the beginning, she talked in front of us about how her hunt for a place to stay was going, and what the prices were for houses. My mother was the one who initiated the divorce after Jay told her a part of a conversation he overheard my dad had with his mother, grandma Anne, about how maybe mother should leave for the night to her parents and come back in the morning (or something in that avenue, I can't remember all details). He later said that he was pitching ideas with grandma on how to help mother get better, as she was feeling burned out at the time and wasn't healing. Instead of waiting till dad got back home did she call her friends and family and left with us. I later learned that she never told dad where we were and that he didn't know where we were for a while. We stayed in a holiday park for a while mother was house hunting, the first time we stayed with her parents, but that was too far from school. We finally found a place to stay after months of living in a vacation home, that wasn't meant for living that long as it barely had enough space for that.\n\nAt first was the relationship between my parents okay during the divorce, but the longer it went on the worst it became and the more I got pulled into it. I was asked at one point to write a letter to the judge of the case about what I wanted, at that point in time was I a stupid 11y\/o kid who knew two living situations. One where I got away with a lot and could do a lot of stuff (aka mother's place), and one which was strict and had caused me physical harm twice in the years before (dad's place). I had sprained my fingers from getting slapped on them on the edge of the table for doing a clapping song after being warned to stop and something that had become a game to my father but was not clear to me while playing the flute. The latter was no longer like a tick, but at that age, everything seemed worse. Mother had taken me to the doctor for my fingers and made up some lie about how I sprained them. I had written about the second instance in my letter to the judge and expressed wanting more time at mother's place. In the end, was it finalized on a 50-50 time split with dad having primary custody over Jay, mother having primary custody over me, and dad paying child support for me and Jay. Dad needed to provide Jay with clothes, school stuff and everything while mother needed to do that for me. This is where I first started feeling like I was less important than Jay.\n\nGrandma Anne would constantly get Jay the stuff he needed and give it to him with me there as well, while at mother's place if I needed stuff Jay also got stuff. If I got something (except on my birthday) then Jay got something, but when Jay got something I got nothing. This happened at mother's place, and I never got stuff at dad's place when I also needed stuff. Jay got sandals even though he hates wearing them, I never got any cause dad thought mother had bought a pair for me and by the time he realised she hadn't they didn't have any for me anymore, this wasn't dad's fault but it hurt a lot when I was younger. I saw Jay getting a lot of stuff and I barely got what I needed while he had more than he needed. At mother's place was it clear that Jay was her favourite as rules were made loose for him while the same rules were stricter for me, and oftentimes were they ignored for him. Jay could do no wrong and never got punished. I remember getting kicked in the chest when going to bed by him and by the time mother finally asked me how I was doing was it no longer hurting. She had spent so long talking and cuddling with him that I had metaphorically speaking, cleaned my own wounds. The same always happened when Jay would hurt me, he would kick, bite, slap and yell at me for the slightest of things (he really had anger issues and never saw anyone for it). Mother only noticed something going on when I started screaming because of the pain and afterwards needed so long to calm him down, explain to him that she wasn't disappointed in him but was in his behaviour (which to him meant she wasn't disappointed as he was not over 10 at this point) and cuddling him that I needed to take care of any bruises or other possible injuries he made myself while having no medical knowledge. This was even more infuriating, knowing mother worked in health care.  He never saw consequences for this behaviour and I was told that he hurt me cause he cared a lot about me and that he didn't mean any of it.\n\nI had three hobbies at that point in time, dancing, reading and playing the Flute. Mother supported the first two, and dad only supported the last one. He never came to my recitals for dance and always complained that I read too much. While mother never bothered with that I needed to play the Flute (she always made dinner late which made practising impossible as when you play too close after eating you'll get pieces of your dinner in your instrument according to dad), she also couldn't be bothered to get me to rehearsal on time.  Back then I played at another woodwind orchestra as I play now, but we were always late. I've quit dancing now and still read a lot and play the Flute. Music has become a really important factor in my life and even helped me make friends. I can go on for hours about how my childhood was and all that yadayada, but if I were to talk about everything this post would become way too long to also include what prompted me to write this post.\n\nLately, have I been feeling down, I've got low self-esteem and my family seems to love insulting me in the name of love and jokes. I've got constant headaches which are written off as not important, I eventually went to see a doctor after the counsellor at uni told me I showed signs of stress and that my body was giving me the pain to notify me it was too much. Those same headaches that weren't important together with other small pains I get (which were also not important) got me a recommendation to a psychiatrist. My past issues with self-harm are rising again (one of the many things my family doesn't even know about) and I'm feeling confused about myself as well. All of this to say that I'm not really in a good place recently. One of the ways it has manifested itself is in making me dead tired, I've had days that I've slept for more than twelve hours and still feel dead on my feet, I feel the same way when I've slept for five hours.\n\nThis morning was the only day this week that I could sleep in a bit, so I decided that I would put my alarm at 10 am to not still have a whole day ahead of me. When I woke up, I heard dad telling Jay he was leaving, and probably wouldn't be back before 1 pm. Jay asked him if I was still asleep and was given as answer \"I don't know probably well and you don't have to take it into account and if she says anything about it just say that I said that\".  I don't expect people to be dead silent just cause I'm sleeping, but with the number of times I've complained about having trouble sleeping and feeling tired I thought it mattered enough to at least show some concern and not write me off as a lazy person. Dad has been constantly acting like I don't do enough, yet when asked he doesn't know what he wants me to do, when I do what he's asking of me he complains I don't do enough for uni.  It's also frustrating knowing that when my brother sleeps in till 10 am or later I get told he needs the sleep and to take it into account.\n\nLately, have I been getting complaints that I eat too slowly, that I shouldn't talk at the dining table and just overall given smaller portions, which has made my relationship with food and eating not that great. I'm constantly hungry nowadays, but can barely eat. I go to bed hungry almost every night, which makes it even more frustrating that I couldn't bring myself to eat or drink today. I've eaten dinner cause I'm expected to eat that with the family and drinking is some sort of social gathering here.\n\nOn to the most fun part of today. I've got rehearsal with the woodwind orchestra every Saturday night from 7.30 pm till 9.30 pm, with the exception of holidays. Today like every other Saturday did dad take me to and from rehearsal, no public transport and I'm not old enough to drive. The place we rehearse in is dirty, it smells and we know for a fact that there hasn't been cleaned since February even though Carnaval has been celebrated in that room and the floor is sticky and the mess from that time has still not been cleaned up. One of the things that tell us that cleaning is not done is the carton of juice that is still near the sound system after 3 weeks. The smell in there made more as one of us feel a bit unwell, and with the amount of sound an orchestra creates do you have a lovely combination (\/s, for my last sentence). I was talking to one of the girls in the orchestra and when I got in the car was the first complaint I got that I was talking too loud, when I speak softer I get complaints I'm speaking too soft. The normal agreement is, that I get drinks after getting home. Dad and Jay were watching a movie and after asking was told they were watching James Bond. I was trying to say that, I wouldn't like getting in the middle of the movie so I won't stay around for long when I couldn't even finish \"I wouldn't like\", cause I got interrupted by dad. He told me that they should be allowed to watch a movie and that I shouldn't dictate what they can and can't. I wasn't even trying to, and when I told him this, did he complain about my attitude while saying it and that I think everything should be about me. What he was saying and the tone brought me to tears, but I wasn't saying anything as I was angry, hurt and trying to stop myself from harming myself to soothe myself. When dad heard me cry I only made things worst for myself, he started almost yelling at me for crying and that I was being ridiculous and that I needed to stop with the nonsense. At this point was I exhausted, I was thirsty, hurt, angry, in pain and frankly felt like I didn't belong to the family like every Saturday.\n\nI enjoy going to rehearsal and I enjoy playing, but dad has put a lot of pressure on playing and constantly growing in music, while also making clear I should never make a career out of it as it doesn't pay well. Why I don't feel like I belong every Saturday? Simple, when I'm not here on Saturday they watch stuff together, a movie or series, but when I'm at home we never do things together. Not even when I'm home on Saturday. We would make plans to watch a movie or series, but we never do it. It feels like they don't enjoy it with my company. There are many more instances and things that make me feel like I don't belong in the family and I've joked about it feeling sometimes like I'm a roommate instead of a member of the family.\n\nOnce grandma Anne even told me she was afraid dad would die early from stress and that I need to step up more. I wish I could and I'm trying to, but at this point in life is it hard looking after myself and taking care of just me. I take on the dog whenever I'm home and dad's out of town, but even then I get accused of not doing enough cause I needed to be in a meeting for a school project and the dog wanted to go out halfway through or because I'm walking the dog too late (it was 1.30 pm instead of 1 pm). I'm not trying to say that I do enough, but sometimes it feels like I'm drowning alone and no one (that aren't online friends) notices I'm drowning. I just am done. I can't continue like this, but I don't have any way to go other than moving out which isn't an option.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678574837.0},{"title":"He said a part of him doesn\u2019t love me.","author":"SeaworthinessOk9827","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TrueOffMyChest\/comments\/11okqu4\/he_said_a_part_of_him_doesnt_love_me\/","text":"Nothing anyone has ever said to me has hurt this badly.

We weren\u2019t ready for that kind of long term commitment and I was also having a really difficult home life and was letting it out on him. \n\nA few years after the breakup, I messaged him because I had heard a lot of rumors about how he was doing (namely that he was doing meth for a period of time after our breakup but had since gotten clean) and I was wondering how he was doing. Part of me also really wanted to apologize for some of my shitty behavior in the relationship and thank him for being supportive and present in a really difficult period of my life, especially since I made that difficult. I think a big part of why I messaged him was because I just wanted some sort of closure, to let him know that I wasn\u2019t the same person and to know that he\u2019d grown and changed too. \n\nIt went better than you might expect. I got the closure I was looking for and we occasionally message just to talk. I don\u2019t have any romantic interest in him and we\u2019re both in relationships now, not the mention we live in different states now. I kind of just think of him as an old high school friend. We talk very occasionally just to talk and catch up, largely because we\u2019ve both struggled to make and keep friends in our adult lives. It\u2019s nice to have someone to talk to from time to time. \n\nThe reason this is a true off my chest is my boyfriend is very\u2026 how should I put this. Jealous? I just know he\u2019d panic if he knew that I was messaging someone I was once in a relationship with. I am completely dependent on my boyfriend for my living situation and transportation and if he were to kick me out I\u2019d have to move to a  different state to live with my aunt with no job and no car and no money to keep a roof over my head. I don\u2019t know if he would kick me out, I honestly don\u2019t know what he\u2019d do. I think best case scenario is I\u2019d have to block one of the only people I really feel comfortable talking to. He\u2019s not abusive, just very jealous of other men and while I don\u2019t think he\u2019d do anything too severe, it\u2019d certainly rock a boat that I can\u2019t really afford to be rock\n\nI have my ex in my phone as a fake name of a real friend from that city, and talk to him on a social media platform I don\u2019t really use anymore to lower the chances of my boyfriend seeing it. I have message notifications off so he doesn\u2019t see a message pop up and ask about it. I pretty much only talk to him when I\u2019m home alone.  It\u2019s my secret that I\u2019m terrified to tell anyone cause I\u2019m scared of the consequences and judgement, but I guess I\u2019ll let strangers judge me now.","upvote_ratio":0.33,"created_utc":1678574246.0},{"title":"I feel a profound sadness that my children don't show interest in things I was interested in as a boy","author":"AdamicAtom","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TrueOffMyChest\/comments\/11oxbta\/i_feel_a_profound_sadness_that_my_children_dont\/","text":"I want to share with my girls the media that I grew up with and loved.

I have intense feelings for my friend, but I\u2019m in a position where I can\u2019t act on them. I need so badly to vent about it, but have nowhere to go, and that\u2019s what this Reddit is for right? So here goes. If anyone actually reads my stupid story, thank you.\nCW: Langauge, innuendo\n\nMen are confusing.\n\nI\u2019m (18F) a student, and last semester I met this boy (18M) and we hit it off-we\u2019ll call him Dog. Ended up having two classes, so we hung out for a lot of my school day. Every day his friends (17-18M), who I\u2019ll call Cat and Lizard, would join us for lunch and we\u2019d have a blast together. I quickly became part of the friend group, who are all awesome. We hang out constantly now. Despite my anxieties, they always include me and now I\u2019m good friends with them all. They\u2019re so damn cool.\n\nNow, a few months into knowing Dog, he revealed his crush on me. Ever since, he\u2019s made being, to put it lightly, being extremely into me very clear, including how our relationship strongly controls his emotions. We share everything, and I\u2019m closer to him than anyone in my whole life. He cares for me so much and is so sweet. I love him to death. To make it more complicated, our conversations sometimes get sexy, which isn\u2019t a big deal to me but is a huge one to Dog.\n\nBut I don\u2019t want a relationship with Dog. And honestly I don\u2019t even really want anything physical with him either. I can\u2019t bring myself to think of him as more than a friend despite caring for him. But when I try to make my feelings clear, he falls into depression for days. Legit. He already goes through so much, so whenever I say something wrong it causes his wellness to plummet. I feel like I can\u2019t navigate my way out of this without hurting him, maybe irreversibly. (And okay, between you and me Reddit, I love him but he has some nice guy vibes)\n\nNow comes the stupid crush. Not on Dog, but Cat. Cat is so dumb, immature, ignorant, and at times alike to my brother. He isn\u2019t even that conventionally attractive as he\u2019s a bigger guy and crushes are so stupid and aghh\u2026but god damn it. He is so hot sometimes. I can\u2019t take it. It all started at this sleepover when he wore a muscle shirt, and ever since then I see him differently. When he pushes his hair back. When we\u2019re calling all night and his voice gets deep and raspy from no sleep. When he gets passionate about things. When he gets red and flustered. When he\u2019s so considerate to his siblings or me (like offering his lap when there\u2019s no more chairs, which I take gladly). When he acts like a tsundere. When he\u2019ll make a rare comment about his desires (he\u2019s a SUB AHH). When he wrestles anyone and always wins. When he teases me relentlessly. When we banter.\n\nAnd GOD the bantering. Reddit. Jesus. It\u2019s the best flirting ever and it\u2019s NOT EVEN FLIRTING. We are so competitive, always betting, teasing, fighting and trying to beat each other in anything. We mess with each other, pushing each other's buttons, and try to outwit each other, and he plays keep away with my shit, and I agdhfhfk it\u2019s so good. \u201cF*** you\u201d \u201cNo thanks!\u201d and \u201cShut up!\u201d \u201cMake me.\u201d etc. etc. He comes up with unique ways to piss me off and I come up with constant bets I can beat him in. The other night alone, I won a bet where he has to wear a collar, played this stupid game where he keeps bonking me with a spoon while I try to wrestle him for it, then we bantered for hours over call until bed.\n\nI\u2019m a total mess over him, and I don\u2019t know what to do. It\u2019s gotten to the point that I think perversely about him while I\u2019m having me time, or even seeing him sweaty does it for me. What\u2019s wrong with me?? Pheromones suck. I can\u2019t help it but I like him so much.\n\nYet-I can\u2019t be with him. I know that. I\u2019m rational and mature enough to make the smart choice. Shooting my shot would ruin the friendship between all three of us. I don\u2019t even know if I want something serious with him anyway. It never ends well for me, and I care for him too much to make him an eventual ex instead of a long-lasting friend. Plus, he\u2019s 17, and while we\u2019re practically the same age the ethics are still odd and I\u2019ve been gr**med before so I\u2019d rather die than possibly do that to him.\n(To clarify, they\u2019re all 17-18 because they\u2019re seniors who take local college classes to earn credits early. So they\u2019re a few months to a year younger. It\u2019s not that odd since I turned 18 last Summer, but still.)\n\nThe part that really sucks though? Apparently he used to like me too. Early on, he told Dog he thought I was cute but wouldn\u2019t go for it \u2018cause he knew Dog liked me. Now these days it\u2019s a 180\u00b0 shift; supposedly while hanging out he couldn\u2019t stop thinking s*xual thoughts of me (over a very normal outfit mind you) and told Dog about his moral dilemma, saying, \u201cShe\u2019s like a sister and I don\u2019t want to objectify her like that.\u201d (As I said, Dog and I tell each other pretty much everything so he told me all this)\n\nBecause of this and me spilling the beans about finding Cat hot, Dog got it in his head that we were secretly a thing and became horribly depressed for weeks before I could clear up the misunderstanding, which put him right back to normal. During that time, though, he was visibly and unnaturally mean to Cat, and their years-long friendship was compromised all because I brought this up. If I even do so much as spend too much time with others, it\u2019ll set him off. Like the other night-Dog was hurt by all the attention on me from his friends and my lack of attention on him, and it made him so upset.\n\nSo what would happen if I did actually go for Cat, and he reciprocated? Apparently Cat once said to Dog if I initiated anything he\u2019d oblige, bro-code be damned I guess. So if I did? I\u2019d either have to try (and most likely fail) to lie to Dog, my dearest friend, and risk hurting him badly, or be open about it, and not only hurt Dog deeply but change a *lot* in the group. And for what? A dopamine fix? But I can\u2019t help how I feel and it\u2019s unbearable these days. I think about Cat like crazy.\n\nTo make matters weirder, Lizard has confessed to having feelings too after months of openly trying to wingman Dog. This friend group is getting complicated. I thought he \u201cflirted\u201d because I was one of the boys; he does it with all of them, after all. Men..are confusing.\n\nAnyway, this schoolyard crush is torture. Cat\u2019s so hot without trying and it\u2019s making me into an idiot. At this point, it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if he knew. He\u2019s quite clever, and I\u2019m so obvious; like I\u2019m walking on thin ice, with no one to help me with my dilemma since these are my friends now.\n\nSo here I am, coming to y\u2019all hoping anyone will actually read this and offer me some pity, because I can\u2019t come to Dog about *everything* anymore. There\u2019s nothing I can do, but hey, I got it off my chest.\n\nTLDR; I like my friend, but due to many factors like our mutual friend liking me, I can\u2019t pursue it and it\u2019s driving me nuts.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678573569.0},{"title":"Gf of 9 years sleeps with someone she\u2019s been talking to while we break up","author":null,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TrueOffMyChest\/comments\/11p24qn\/gf_of_9_years_sleeps_with_someone_shes_been\/","text":"\nSo pretty much English is my second language so don\u2019t judge me on my spelling lol.

I broke down at work, I became useless and a puddle; and could not mentally handle any events for the remainder of the day, let alone to this point of me writing this. I had to take some anti-anxiety medication for panic attacks I\u2019m prescribed to get through. I'm still reeling from this, emotions are all over the place, and don't know where I'm going yet. The most likely solution is cutting off my family completely. I've seen a therapist and my PCP, and am on the road to help with my mentality. \n\nHere it goes...My parents are\/were hoarders. Growing up, there was a constant height of trash off of the floor, with only paths to the various rooms. They were also cat people, but obviously did not clean up after them, resulting in more issues. Going through school, I was the one who smelled (and growing older became conscious of this), and had several issues. Elementary and Middle I'd have issues with even borrowing a book from the library, but I would go to return it and they'd have to call my parents. In later grades I found out it's because of the smell of the book, they'd trash it and my parents would have to pay to replace it. There's one vivid day I remember going to school, and being told \"there's something stuck to your leg\". Ok, whatever, I checked it out, and it was a dryer sheet, BUT it was attached because there was cat fesces adhering the sheet to my jeans. I was old enough at this point to be embarrassed as hell, cleaned it the best that I could, and folded the bottom of my jeans (where it was) to hide the stain.\n\nProtected services did get involved thanks to a neighbor who called. I was pulled out of class and asked some questions, then ultimately was told that I would be staying with my grandparents for a while due to the state of our house. They never enforced this, so I still stayed at the house, and after school tried cleaning the house. I remember filling a trash bag I found, giving up at the state of the house and crying. It took a 15yd trash bin to be delivered for the house to get \"cleaned\". It was clean... for a time. They put new carpeting down (patchwork lengths from the store), cleaned what furniture they could and threw the most severe away. CPS checked in, and decided things were fine. Then the house returned to \u201cnormal\u201d.\n\nI did have medical issues growing up, which always had the same series of events. I had symptoms, and pain, but were usually written off that I didn't want to go to school. Months later, a Doctor would run the correct test and BAM, I was proven right. First time this happened, it was a sensitive genital issue causing stomach pain. Finally a doctor did a physical and noticed X wasn't right, and had to have surgery. Yes, surgery. The second time I was having stomach pains, vomiting, more, and the same story occurred. My 10th (not sure what actual count) ER visit, a doctor did a cat scan and noticed I had a tumor causing an intussusception (intestine going inside itself, causing a total blockage). Hours later I was having emergency surgery because of the severity, and luckily the tumor portion was non-cancerous. I remember both times my parents apologized for not believing me.\n\nDid I mention I never had a bedroom or bed of my own? I was a living room couch child. My brother got to have his own room, and if our house was clean, there would have been rooms for me. However, due to the state of hoarding even after cleaning, rooms were still filled with stuff. It wasn't until I was about 16 I \"stayed the night\" at my grandparents and had a room with a bed. I more or less occupied this room, couldn't make it my own, just slept in the guest bedroom every night with my stuff at my parents\u2019 house. Even then, I was used as a sort of baby-sitter for my grandfather (whom i adored) who had severe Alzheimer\u2019s and dementia. Grandma couldn't handle being there, so I had to stay and watch Grandpa to make sure he was fed, clothed, cleaned, etc...\n\nMy brother was helped with everything throughout his life. My parents and even grandparents would co-sign loans to get him new vehicles. My mom got him a good Physical Therapy technician job, and he squandered it. He stole money from the company, and my mom and him lost their jobs because of it. Me? I had to work for everything that I had, and eventually with my SO's help and that of her parents, we made it to where we are now.\n\nMy brother also had mental issues that were never addressed. He would constantly run away, and the entire family would kick into gear to go find him and bring him home. One occurrence was even on my birthday (tween ish years). We rarely got along and would physically fight in whatever space there was in our house. He would make points to target my \"family jewels\" to make it more painful or who knows why. There was an incident we got into a fight, and his SO made him go outside and she went with him. My mom told me to leave, he needs to cool down. Whatever, I was leaving, and saw him pacing in the back yard by our barn with an axe. His SO was blocking his route to the front yard, I GTFO'd real quick. That image of him with that is burnt into my skull.\n\nMy brother came first, but I was the support system of the house. My dad worked during the day and I don\u2019t really have a relationship with him. My mother because my best friend, and she would air everything out to me. How we couldn't pay the bills and had to \"rob peter to pay paul\" (pay one bill and skip another). My dad didn't care as long as he got his allowance, and he'd just go off to work. Well, mom would go to me for support. At the age of 16 I had a mental break as well. I had a promising job offer, but due to not having a car, they couldn't use me. I broke, became suicidal and knew exactly how I was going to end it. I ended up in the hospital, where they wanted to send me to a mental facility, but due to finances, I never got the help I needed and was ultimately taken home. A medication side-effect may have caused this, but this still broke me, that I couldn't get a job to help my family.\n\nMy SO and I even have had to hold back our life to help my parents and brother. My parents never paid the taxes on the house, so each year we'd get a notice that we had to pay X years taxes from 3 years ago plus interest or they are taking the house. My SO and I lived with my grandparents, helping them as they aged and worked jobs. Our money would go to pay their taxes to save the house. To get groceries because X happened. We even had to bail out my brother, when his electric was going to be shut off for a delinquent $2.1k bill. We bailed him out because he had two little girls under 6 that we adored.\n\nFast forward, I was working as an EMT in my hometown. In July of 2016 I had a mental break again, and became bed ridden. On the bed was my only safe zone.. At this time my parents, and brothers house became infested with fleas. I would manage to get to my parents, but would get fleas on me, freak out because of my lack of mental stability, and leave. I was in a cycle of going home, showering, and being stuck on the bed. I still receive counseling and am on medication to manage this, it's terrible. When my SO would manage to get me to go out, and see my parents, it just led to worse things. I'd start having a panic attack at their house, and Mom would tell me just to calm down. I'd have a flashback of a horrific car accident, but just calm down. My Mom never really understood it, and that has always bothered me\/affected me.\n\nIn 2017 my SO and I found a job that came with an apartment. We jumped on it, and got the F out of there. This job ultimately led us to save up, buy a house, pay off our vehicle, and work together. The parents still effected us. Even after moving out, my mother would call for me to fix her problems. They didn't have money for this, something's wrong with their car and I need to fix it, complain about my father treating her badly. There was always SOMETHING. My mom didn't have the best health, and would air this out to me as well. That if something happened to her, my brother would more than likely not watch out for my father. She made me promise to take care of him if he out lived her (this is important for later). They still have the routine of the taxes not being paid, and this just became a yearly occurance. Eventually a pipe burst at their house, and the city shut their water off. They didn't have they money to have someone come fix it, and it was on long enough to effect the foundation of the house (dirt crawl space foundation for a 100 year old house). The house was on the edge of being condemned. Finally, they moved out about a year ago. They wanted help moving, but I could not bring myself to their house because of the smell, and buggy past. I managed to skate by without helping. Last spring, they had gotten furniture from the rent-a-center places, and low and behold got bed bugs. I broke down, I knew they needed help, and needed money for an exterminator. Ofcourse, my SO and I offered, but they were able to manage to roll it into their rent somehow. Whatever, we didn't have to shell out for something, again. After this call, I never went to their apartment, rarely saw them, and would freak out at the thought of meeting up with them. I would talk to my Mom on the phone every few days to hear about about the family (that i purposely distanced myself from), and hear about all her problems.\n\nWell... January of this year she passed away suddenly. We believe a virus had effected her heart, and her body gave out. She has a long medical history, and we believe it really would not take a lot for this to happen. Remember that promise? Now I have to grieve my mother somehow and take care of my dad. Now he lived alone in said apartment. I was forced into making conversation with all this family I had pulled away from for so many reasons, including my brother. I regretted not talking to her more or seeing her, but I mentally could not handle knowing the state of their house and apartment. I don't even remember the last time I actually hugged my mother. The last text I sent her was the morning of when she passed, was when she texted me \"cold is kicking my butt\" and all I said was \"damn thats not good\". What kind of last words is that? With the bed bugs and apartment issues, We never did christmas or anything. I STILL have her presents wrapped sitting in my living room. What are you supposed to do with those? But I digress, I'm rambling; there's a lot of regret and issues there. My sister in law stepped up, and has been managing his finances, etc...\n\nFrom the day that she passed, I have talked to my dad EVERY single day. If it gets to be noon, I feel guilty I haven't even texted him and will immediately do so. We live about 30 minutes away from him, and have seen him once a week at the least ever since. I still can't bring myself to go to the apartment or have him to our house, so we're breaking our budget to take him out somewhere. Mental catch 22. Mentally can't tolerate going to his place, or him possibly bringing something to ours. On the flipside I can't leave him alone because of this damn promise I made my mother.\n\nAbout a week ago, my father had a stroke. Before I continue, I will make these parts clear, he had zero right sided movement or feeling in face, arm, and leg. He is now in physical therapy rehab at the hospital expected to make an absolute full recovery. My sister in law is still co-ordinating care for him and managing whatever else is needed. I broke down again, but this time became numb. I didn't feel anything, nothing tasted good, didn't want to eat, just numb. I failed to take care of him. How didn't I see this coming? What did I miss? This is his second stroke, his first was 5 years ago, he was on the right path of things he needed to fix. His diet, stop chewing tobacco, stop all the energy drinks, etc.. Well... That had stopped. He stopped taking meds for some reason, and began chewing tobacco again! (Found it in his bag when we went to visit him at the hospital). All the things they warned him to stay away from, and he went right back to them...\n\nThis brings us to somewhat present. 3 days ago was my mental break at work. For two days I was taking the anti-anxiety meds (they are as needed). They can be addictive, and are considered a controlled substance. I usually save those as my last resort, but to function, I had to. Ever since I can't handle a single thing about my dad. He needs a phone charger? Panic attack. Text message notification from him? Oh hell what does he neeed, what happened, BAM, Panicy again.\n\nThere's so much more that I haven't put in here. I have been realizing how much my family, my own parents screwed me over mentally. Knowing my dad is being taken care of and will recover completely from the stroke, I am an inch from cutting everyone in my family out of my life. I simply cannot handle the stress they bring me. When phone calls are always problems to be fixed, and there is zero positive interaction with them, it just mentally wears me down to the point I am now. It feels like my only way out.. God this post is long, but so much isn't here... I feel used to hold the family together, and I'm done. I literally cannot continue for the sake of my health.\n\nTLDR: My parents and family really f\\*\\*\\*ed me up, and I'm finally at a point to be done with the entire family for my own health and sanity.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, I do know there are horrific things that have been done to others out there by their parents, but this is just my story and how they f'ed me.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678550278.0},{"title":"My parents gave me crappy genetics.","author":"Tiny-Mechanic-7178","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TrueOffMyChest\/comments\/11p4g2i\/my_parents_gave_me_crappy_genetics\/","text":"I (16F) loathe my life, and l wish my parents didn\u2019t have me or I was born to another family. I hate my life. Yeah, my parents are nice and kind, and take care of me blah blah blah, but literally all I got was crappy genetics, both physically and health wise. \n\nI understand life isn\u2019t fair, but It\u2019s so irritating that other people are born with pretty privilege or the ability to be healthy, and I just got absolutely nothing. \n\nFrom the physical standpoint, I\u2019m literally mixed with everything. My facial features don\u2019t seem to match me, or fit my face or anything because they don\u2019t work together. For example, my nose. It\u2019s not a black nose, but it\u2019s also not a white nose. It\u2019s just a whatever nose, that\u2019s just big and ugly. There\u2019s no heritage for me to maybe be like \u201coh hey look! I have the nose of my ancestors! so I feel better!\u201d because literally I can\u2019t pinpoint my nose to any type of ethnicity or whatever. It\u2019s just\u2026 there. There\u2019s also my teeth, which I inherited from my dad. I\u2019ve been in braces since I was 8\/9 years old. They\u2019ve spent close to 15k trying to fix my teeth that are jacked up. I have extra teeth growing under my permanent set, Teeth that refuse to come down, and teeth that are stuck in the roof of my mouth that are crookedly growing sideways instead of down. I also had a horrible underbite and a giant gap that you could drive a truck through in the front. I don\u2019t even feel like talking about my hair right now. I hate my hair too. \n\nIt absolutely sucks. I\u2019ll never be the pretty friend or the friend that gets noticed. I\u2019ll never get asked to prom or homecoming by a boy. No one will come up to me and compliment me on how pretty I am, like they do with my best friends. I can pile on as much makeup as I want, and I still won\u2019t be noticed. I\u2019m just plain ugly. My friends have crushes who like them and boyfriends, and I have no one.  \n\nThen there\u2019s the health side. I have lung issues, digestive issues, immune system problems, and a ton of allergies. I have a weird deficiency I was born with, so my immune system is weak and I\u2019m always sick. A ton of what I have is inherited from parents, and I just turned out to get the luck of the draw to get every single bad gene they have. I never get to just live my life normally. I always have to deal with some sort of pain or some issue every single day. \n\nAs much as I love my parents, I wish I was born to a different family or not at all. I hate my life every single day and sometimes I wish  I were dead.

For further context, we\u2019re both ASD\/ADHD (I\u2019m passive and inattentive, he\u2019s manic and hyperactive). Within minutes, his mood can go from hyper and playful to full panic (often about his dog roaming around the home unattended even though he\u2019s the one who lets him out) to volatile anger (yelling, cussing, and hitting things) and back to calm (laughing at videos on his phone). I\u2019m the kind of person who keeps a pretty consistent mood when I\u2019m alone (usually calm\/melancholic), but I\u2019m also very empathetic so I ride his emotions with him. \n\nThe first problem is when he\u2019s in panic or anger, he\u2019s aggressive and shifts a lot of responsibility to me and expects me to help change his mood. \u201cHelp me! Why did you do that?! Why didn\u2019t you remind me?!\u201d In the moment, he sometimes blames me for whatever went wrong and expects my immediate support regardless of what I\u2019m doing. He gets more upset if I don\u2019t immediately respond the way he expects me to, even though it\u2019s not always clear what he needs. As soon as the issue is resolved, he\u2019s calm again and will usually apologize for yelling and stressing me out.\n\nThe second problem is when my mood doesn\u2019t go back to calm with his, he gets upset again. He either gets defensive (\u201cI was angry because I didn\u2019t know where my crippled dog was\u201d even though he\u2019s the one who let him out and got distracted while monitoring him) or passive aggressive (\u201cSorry I asked for help\u201d) and walks away. I\u2019ve told him multiple times that I need at least 5-10 minutes to transition from panic\/anger to calm. \n\nHis constant mood shifts and lack of support for my emotional needs are making me feel avoidant. My day is generally pretty quiet until he comes home. I feel on edge because his moods are so unpredictable and I have to drop whatever I\u2019m doing to support him, often while he\u2019s criticizing me. It\u2019s so draining that afterwards I just want to be alone for the rest of the day, but it hurts his feelings because he constantly wants my attention. I\u2019m tired of reiterating my needs to him only to repeat the same situation with no accommodation for my own emotional needs.

He went for it and after months he succeeded and he bagged her. \n\nThey went on to date for 2 years, and throughout that period i became the middle ground between them, the 3rd POV if you want to call it that. \n\nI was completely fine and I got over H ever since she blew me off for him, i was happy for him but a lot happened during the relationship, too many fights and scenarios that a couple of 15 years old shouldn't go through for their age. o\n\nEither-way, i stood by their sides all up until each of us went a in a direction. We were now split in three different countries, and the relationship between S and H started to rotten up. Fights on the daily, no effort from both sides, outrage about so many little things caused the inevitable which was them breaking up. \n\nS had had enough of H months prior to the break up, actually letting me know that he cannot continue much longer and that he is starting to lose feelings, and H on the other hand wanted to break up due to the fact that S wasn't putting in enough effort. I knew that their breakup was coming but i stayed silent because i was not going to betray either of them. \n\nAfter the break up, S let me know that he's doing fine and that he found himself two potential girls that he's talking with and he's enjoying, while H needed a lot of support which i gave to her. \n\nThey broke up in the beginning of December 2022 and i kept talking with H all up until she came back to the country for xmas break. Throughout that time, sentences like \"I should've went for you \" and \"you've been practically dating me for the last 2 years too you know? \" were said, and i kept my ground by ignoring them and continuing the conversation. \n\nHowever this is when shit turns: I knew that S was also coming back in the break so we planned new years eve together, and we invited many people to the mountains to celebrate with us. He knew i had a lot of female friends and that if i could set him up with one, so since i was friends with my ex i asked him if he wanted to go for her as i didn't mind. He obviously went for it and as a joke i told him that since ur going for my ex im going for yours and he agreed thinking i was serious. \n\nI didn't think much of it until H came back to town and i went to see her with a couple of my friends, when we went up, we had a lot of fun catching up but all my friends had to leave and since i lived close by i told her that i could stay there for a little longer. I shit you knot this girl slams the door as soon as they leave, jumps at me and makes out with me, I'm shellshocked and i leave that night mind blown at what just happened. I go home and im lost between telling S that we made out or not. I end up not telling him as we agreed and two nights before new years he decides that he doesn't want to go for my ex anymore and here i decide to cut off H as i'd rather keep my childhood best-friend than keep her. \n\nI completely ghost her from dec 28 up until 21 of jan 2023.

I was so thrilled and got a little emotional about it. \n\nWe had a lovely time (or so I thought) until the very last night when she had arranged for us to go out to a few local places for a few drinks.

It\u2019s Bape and their sweatshirts are really something if you know. The guy thanked me and it was a friendly interaction and very brief. \n\nI walked over to my friend and gestured over to the guy explaining I liked that designer and that\u2019s what that was about.

We were about done with darts and I suggested with the last of our drinks to go into the other room in the bar so I could tell her about the guys I found attractive, you know, classic people watching. Her response was something along the lines of, \u201cOkay, but we\u2019re not going to point and stare.\u201d I clarified I wasn\u2019t doing that and she then referred to sweatshirt guy. I said I didn\u2019t think I did that and besides his back was turned.

Partner was hurt at first, but thankful for my honesty and grateful that I value his and my freedom. \n\nI\u2019ve been with my partner roughly a year and a half. One week ago, he surprised me by calling me his girlfriend. I was pleasantly surprised as we had discussed a couple months prior how we were tiptoeing around labeling our relationship, yet we were fine with what we had, even if we weren\u2019t ready to describe it. Even a mental health professional thought it was a healthy decision for both of us to not rely heavily on labels. I suppose that changed when he first told me he Loved me. \u201cLove\u201d is a word I don\u2019t take lightly and we\u2019d talked about that months before he said it. It was kinda cute how it happened: We\u2019d had a heartfelt conversation about familial relationships and we both wanted to say it, but hesitated. Then we opened up about why we were hesitating. I told him that I was afraid I would hyper-fixate on wanting to move near him so we could be closer, which could take months if not years, since we both had recently made big life decisions and moved to a different place in our respective states. This fixation could put a strain on our relationship, I\u2019d feared. He said he understood my concerns and assured me there was no rush bc our love for one another developed without me making these changes. Then he said he loved me. Since I personally believe love transcends time and space, I told him I loved him too. That feeling has not changed and I don\u2019t think it ever will. \n\nA few weeks later, I brought up the idea of polyamory and open relationships. I was honest with how I felt, saying that we were young and inexperienced, so it would be selfish of me to deny him of experimenting with others, especially since I\u2019m pansexual and he\u2019s bisexual. He was uncomfortable with what I said and asked for clarification, to which we discussed how we felt for a couple of hours. We talked about our insecurities. My biggest insecurity was the potential inevitability of one or both of us developing a strong relationship with another person, that we would not be the primary support partner for each other, which could get tricky if we shared assets one day. His biggest insecurity was me seeing other men. Even though I\u2019m pan, I don\u2019t form strong bonds with others very easily, so it is unlikely I\u2019d have enough time to even see other men, let alone anyone else on the spectrum. But since our libidos are different, I still thought it a good idea to open up an avenue for both of us to experiment regardless. We came to the conclusion that for now, monogamy is best as there\u2019s so much richness in one another that we\u2019d like to explore. I still believe this. \n\nBut one week ago, he called me his girlfriend. And while I was happy, it\u2019s also a term I take very seriously. Quite frankly, it\u2019s a label that has implications of being fully committed to each other\u2019s well being. I blushed and giggled, and called him my boyfriend, openly communicating my surprised joy. For me, this was a sign that it wasn\u2019t foolish of me to spend the next couple of years securing a life with him. \n\nThat brings us to today. He asks me if I\u2019ve ever experimented with women before and I replied with of course. We never had a problem talking about our past relationships, so this question wasn\u2019t out of the ordinary for me. He says he\u2019s never experimented with a man, but he\u2019d like to one day. I asked him if this meant that he wanted an open relationship, to which he replied he think he could see himself in one. I thought it was a nice thing we could have a conversation about later to see how we should move forward with our relationship. i.e., I wanted to set time aside later to talk more about it before we made that decision. Then he asks me, \u201cDoes this mean we\u2019re in an open relationship?\u201d I laughed and asked \u201cAlready? \ud83d\ude06\u201d. He said yes. \n\nOkay. I realized he was serious and remembered that not only am I young, but he\u2019s even *younger*. There\u2019s so much space and beauty in this world for a person in their 20s to explore, and even though we\u2019re committed to each other now, there\u2019s no way in hell that\u2019s guaranteed for a lifetime. I love living in the moment, yet I also like to prepare myself for the future. And the future I glimpsed when he told me that was full of resistance from the loosely monogamous relationship we currently have. A familiar knot in my stomach formed and I asked myself if I was acting on insecurity. It didn\u2019t feel like insecurity; it felt like maturity. So I told him that I loved him and because I love him, I\u2019d like to remain label-less. At first, he thought he\u2019d done something wrong. So we talked for an hour about why I made my decision. My idea of love is being committed to my partner\u2019s wellbeing and a HUGE part of my wellbeing is freedom. If I want freedom for myself (even if it\u2019s not geared toward relationships), it would be selfish of me to not grant that freedom to someone else. It was hard and I did cry later, but I believe I saved both of us a world of confusion, betrayal, and hurt. \n\nHe told me that no matter what happens between us, he will be eternally happy and grateful he got a chance to love me, which is something I\u2019ve told him in the past. \n\nI still love him and he still loves me. I\u2019m so young, though, and it eats at me that I\u2019m being foolish for not wanting to be his gf, at least not yet. I don\u2019t have a problem with open and poly relationships, but I only brought it up to him bc weren\u2019t officially bf & gf. I want to be closer to him, but I want to give him space to explore other people.","upvote_ratio":0.5,"created_utc":1678566178.0},{"title":"Today I acted being asleep, didn't end well.","author":"Chainsaw_Cupacake","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TrueOffMyChest\/comments\/11ou16v\/today_i_acted_being_asleep_didnt_end_well\/","text":"I, (M 19) was trying to catch my sleep when I overheard my two roommates talk.

Alex & I met online about 3-4 years ago & ever since our friendship was never broken, I\u2019ve been there for them ever since they\u2019re cancer came back & I\u2019d worry about them everyday. During that time they got together with Dan, eventually all 3 of us were getting along till last night I was feeling jealous & lonely for their relationship & that\u2019s when my stupidity started the downfall of the friendship, I sent an image of \u201cme\u201d (it was from a website called Pony Town) crying & when my friend saw it they told me they felt like shit.

There was a period in my life where I would play outside and play video games on consoles, without any access to the internet or phones. \n\nAt the age of 5, my father introduced me to the computer. I was excited because I was really hyperfixated on dinosaurs so I would spend all day looking at Jurassic Park MVs on Youtube. \n\nThen, I made a facebook at around age 11. I admittedly was very into My Little Pony, so when I opened the account I discovered the concept of roleplaying, so I began to roleplay on Facebook. \n\nOne can imagine where this is going. \n\nI had a lot of adult friends on facebook. I want to reassure that I was always honest about my age, and I typed like a kid too. Most of them were kind and while weird that you would befriend an 11-12 year old, they were pretty chill when it came to that. \n\nSome would engage in sexual conversation with me. Mostly in the form of roleplay, and I would engage because I didn\u2019t know any better. \n\nI remember one conversation clearly, because this person was clearly an adult. The way he typed was mature and he would use sexual terms that I was not familiar with. \n\nWhile not to get too graphic, it was very uhhh detailed on what he would do to my character. I don\u2019t recall feeling scared or ashamed, and truth be told, I believe it negatively shaped my relationship with sex. \n\nThere was another person too, but I don\u2019t recall that many details. \n\nThese memories resurfaced a few days ago, and I don\u2019t know how to feel about it. \n\nIn my head, I\u2019m just like \u201cyeah, that was crazy.\u201d \nYet, I feel somewhat numb. The more I think about it, the heavier my chest gets. As if I want to cry, but can\u2019t or don\u2019t want to. \n\n\nTL\/DR: i was like 11 or 12 on mlp facebook and was engaged with sexual rps by adults and i don\u2019t know how to feel about it.","upvote_ratio":0.5,"created_utc":1678555294.0},{"title":"This will be the last month of my life","author":"Brief-Art-4281","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TrueOffMyChest\/comments\/11opiil\/this_will_be_the_last_month_of_my_life\/","text":"And I want to do as much good as I can for other people, what can you advise","upvote_ratio":0.33,"created_utc":1678555068.0},{"title":"Everyone's hate for low rise jeans is making my life fucking frustrating","author":"SakuraNectarine","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TrueOffMyChest\/comments\/11op57z\/everyones_hate_for_low_rise_jeans_is_making_my\/","text":"I can't handle waistband touching my stomach, I think it's an autism sensitivity thing, it's been a thing my entire fucking life.

I have this ex, and we're still friends, or rather, acquaintances. We didn't break up that well, but over the time, I handled it, I know it's a dick move, handling it just now, but still. I'm changing myself, and so, this is when we just become \"friends\" whenever she's in trouble, I help her. She has a new boyfriend? Okay, don't care. It's my best friend? Okay, still don't care, that's your love life. You're in a tough spot? Okay, I'll help you as always. I gave her advice, each time she needed it. But no, not anymore. My best friend has been suffering, for so long because their relationship is toxic. And my best friend is a pushover, so he can't necessarily make decisions by himself. He asked a lot of people whether or not he should break up with her, and they all said yes. But he still doesn't wanna do it.\n\nFast forward this night. My best friend called me, he wants to break up with her and whatnot, I said sure, go ahead, it's good for you. And so while we were in a call, he sent the message, and so, she replied, asking why? And that she's crying, now he doesn't want to break up, but I told him to go on.\n\nHe does, and so, since she hasn't been replying, he checked her acc, (they have acc to each others acc) and saw that she messaged a mutual friend of theirs, and said that \"He's just like my ex\" We were laughing, because me and him? We don't even have any similarities. Hell, he's a much better bf than me, I know that. And so, he further saw messages, and saw that \"I hate my ex, I only go to him for advices but I fucking hate him\"(I'm using my ex since she said my real name) and so it ticked me off. I didn't show it to my best friend, but after we ended the call, she went to me, and asked what to do.\n\nI'm not fucking replying to that. I've put up with you for so fucking long, I helped you in so many ways. I helped you from stop breaking up with him, but no, this is too much, I don't care anymore, I don't love her, I don't care about her. That's what I do know. But being so fucking reliant, on me?

So this is something I never told anyone but the more i think about it I need to get it off my chest. \n\nA bit of background. My parents split up when I (F) was 12. It was a bit of a messy situation, but well I ended up living with my mom. I didn\u2019t have a super great relationship with my dad, but I would still see him every weekend or every other weekend for a meal. \n\nFast forward to when I was 16, and this is what now I realize I should have told someone a long time ago. My dad had to travel a lot for work, so he once offered me to come along with him to a big city he had to go to (city name irrelevant in the story) and have sort of a vacation. I thought it would be cool to visit the city while my dad would be working, and maybe that would make us bond, so I came along. \n\nAfter breakfast in the hotel, we would go back to the bedroom to brush our teeth and leave for the day. Thing is, after my dad brushed his teeth, he would spend some extra time in the bathroom. At the beginning I just thought he had to number 2, until I heard certain noises that made me realize he wasn\u2019t pooping but masturbating. I remember this made me extremely uncomfortable and I just wanted to get out of there. Also, the hotel room was really small, and the bathroom didn\u2019t even have a proper door (it was more of a sliding plastic door). I remember sitting as far from the bathroom door as I could because of how grossed I felt, but it still wasn\u2019t far enough to stop hearing it. This happened every day during that trip and also another trip where it was only the two of us. \n\nI thought it was really weird a dad would masturbate in the same room as his daughter while she would be waiting for him to go out. But I was a shy kid and this made me feel very weird, so I buried it in my memory and never told anyone. \n\nNow ten years later, I realized this might have caused me some trauma and I should have told someone when it happened. The other day I heard my bf masturbating in the shower and hearing the same noise just triggered me so much I started crying and hyperventilating. After he came out of the shower he of course asked me what was wrong and wanted to help, but I felt I couldn\u2019t tell him because I don\u2019t want to make him feel weird for doing something that triggered me. We have also had conversations before for me feeling weird about masturbation. \n\nI honestly didn\u2019t realize how much it affected me, but I can\u2019t tell anyone in my family since it was a long time ago + will only bring problems. I wish I could tell my bf but him being the reason I connected the dots won\u2019t be nice to hear and I don\u2019t want this to affect his masturbation\/our sex life.

Focus on yourself, improving you and be productive. \n\nIf you treat your family and friends like crap and expect them to just be ok with it, stop being selfish.

Stop using the people who love you unconditionally. \n\nIf you are a person who ghosts, or does the slow fade without communicating to the other person that you are not interested because you\u2019re too afraid of conflict, you need to grow up. Stop bread crumbing and pulling the zombie BS. Like I don\u2019t know who hurt you, but hurting other is not the way to deal with that.

Yes it will initially hurt the other person, but they will get over it and move on a lot easier. It\u2019s called accountability.

It\u2019s not rare to have cats in our yard they like to hide there and since we aren\u2019t there the whole week they stay there all the time.

He said he had to put it outside or else the house is going to smell like dead cat once he dies. I looked outside when he said that and there was the cat staring at me, it was camouflaged in some leaves so it wouldn\u2019t be seen but it can\u2019t even move. I felt so sad because I have no money to take them to a vet. \n\nHere in Mexico most people don\u2019t really care about the animals, we already have enough problems to deal with.

Why can't I get frustrated about being sick, being let down over and over. Why? What's wrong with me. I just want to express myself normally. I want to see my family more often without worrying about how it would affect my health or being scared I'll collapse if I go. Why can't I control my hands enough to paint the way I used to?

So I did just that I was walking (not very far) for 4-5  weeks on this broken foot. It was painful yes but I thought I had to do this. Sometimes it didn't hurt. \n\nPrior to my injury I was a very active person hiking, travelling, walking, volunteering and walking along the beach. I own two dogs so I am very active with them. \n\n5th week comes around I still had this large bump on the size of my foot, it was hard and painful when pressed on. Doctor told me to get x-rays done weight bearing, laying down x-rays, I got an MRI told and ultrasound also. It was confirmed Lisfranc fracture broken in 3 places. I cried and I know I may sound weak crying over broken bones. They told me I needed surgery I'm going on 3 weeks post op. I'm in a cast, I have no idea how long this cast stays on when I can start weight bearing again or walking. They told me nothing. \nI'm in bed all day watching the world go by I do have several mental illnesses that do already impact my daily living.

No seriously what's the point of going through that? The endless suffering, the surgeries, fusion if necessary. What's the point? I'm never going to be able to run again, hike, walk long distances. Some people can after this some people go back into their careers but not all. Some even run again marathons the lucky ones.  What if I'm the one with the pain luck?

All this money has been achieved on the verge of financially cheating her partners.  For example, dating multiple men at once, let's say one gives her a bag, so she comes and tells the 2nd boyfriend that she wants to buy a bag that costs $100, so he gives it the money to her, finally she ends up with $100 and a purse. It's just an example but that's more or less the way she gets money.  \n\nThat's how she managed to get a loan for a house, one of her ex-boyfriend paid for her car loan and she always finds someone to pay her expenses(but not like sugar daddy kind, more like lying to middle worker men). Although she has a stable job, it is not enough for her.  \n\nAlmost all the money she gets, she saves it.  She tries to spend as little as possible on herself.  (she buys cheap food, buys hardly any clothes or makeup and only goes to the salon if she can get her boyfriend to pay for it). This is what I have observed since we started to drift apart little by little (especially since I got married) however we always tried to talk and support each other when we need it.  (once she lent me her car to go to another city that was 1 hour away, obviously I paid for the gas but it was a life saver at that moment) \n\nRecently she has lost a lot of weight, almost 50 pounds less, so she she feels prettier and kinda entitled, she is still obsessed with continuing to lose weight (although she no longer needs it, she is right at her ideal weight).\n\nApart from the money thing, it seems like she has a complex where she always tries to date her boyfriends or ex-boyfriends of her friends, I remember many years ago, that when I started dating an ex-boyfriend, and we stayed at his house, we all drank, I fell asleep on the sofa, and according to my ex-boyfriend, some months later, he confessed to me that they slept together that time, and he asked me for forgiveness, I honestly didn't believe it, rather I believed that he wanted me to end the friendship with her bc he was toxic af (I ended up breaking up with him later). \n\nAs time went by, I noticed how she had things with the boyfriends-ex-boyfriends of her other friends, but there was always an excuse on her part.  I moved to another country years ago so I no longer found out about those details, until recently.  It turns out that she is going to marry the ex-boyfriend of one of her friends (now ex friend). And apparently that guy is not a good thing (he has 3 children with different women, he doesn't have a stable job, etc.) Besides, he is a Jehovah's Witness, so Kelly is also converting to that religion but just for convenience. \n\nMy husband has asked me to please keep more distance from her and her affairs, that she is not a good influence on our son (when he was born, I chose her as his godmother, since I have no siblings or family close).\n\nYesterday I was talking to my other best friend, Paul, who is also a friend of hers, and he told me something that surprised me.  Last year I went to visit my country with my family (husband and son) we didn't go for many days so I didn't have much time to go out with my friends, so when I went to the beauty salon, we agreed to meet there (the owner of the salon is my friend too), Kelly and Paul arrived, we drank wine, talked and had a good time. When my hair was done, Kelly and Paul took me to my mother-in-law's house, where my husband was waiting for me to go out to dinner (I had to specifically ask my husband to please come out and say hello since he I didn't want to) Kelly and Paul greeted, my husband greeted them, everything was friendly and respectful.  Well, Paul told me, that because my husband greeted Kelly, she immediately thought that he wanted something with her (which was not the case, not at all, Paul and I were there and it was not like that) Paul told Kelly that he didn't see anything unusual in my husband, just a normal greeting and that's it, but Kelly insisted that he wanted something with her, and that makes me feel really uncomfortable and awkward with her, because I 100% know that\u2019s not the case. \n\nI have already told Kelly before, that it would be good for her to take psychological therapy, because she has a distorted perception of the reality of things, she is so used to lying that she simply no longer tells the truth.  I think the best thing I can do is get away from her, which is a hard decision for me because I love and appreciate her so much but she doesn't listen to any advice and doesn't want any help from her either.\n\nPD: the reasons because my husband doesn\u2019t like her is because he thinks she\u2019s a bad person, and bc of the way she gets money from men. Her ex bf that paid for her car loan was an ex-classmate of my husband\u2019s,and at the same time she was dating other guys.","upvote_ratio":0.5,"created_utc":1678546571.0},{"title":"I kind of wish my mum wasn't free on my birthday","author":"Haunting-Amphibian23","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TrueOffMyChest\/comments\/11om5co\/i_kind_of_wish_my_mum_wasnt_free_on_my_birthday\/","text":"This is probably going to make me sound like a bitch, but I just need to vent.\n\nMy birthday is next week.

But I was looking forward to spending that time with just my dad and husband. I wouldn't have to remember to censor what I talk about, or worry about whether she wants to do what I do. I just know she's going to be like \"it's your birthday, why not do something you usually can't do?\". Maybe she won't be, I just don't know.\n\nI do love my mum obviously. Just the limitations get stressful sometimes. Like I said, just wanted to vent into the reddit void.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1678546530.0},{"title":"I don't want my younger sister to grow up","author":"Door_Kun__","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TrueOffMyChest\/comments\/11o57sj\/i_dont_want_my_younger_sister_to_grow_up\/","text":"I'm 21(m) my sister is 12 about to be 13 (to clarify she is my cousin but we adopted her ) but I was looking back at pics of her when she was little and just thinking about how much she's grown up in such a short time and I know it's not cool or manly but I nearly cried my eyes out thinking about her growing up idk why but I needed to post this somewhere","upvote_ratio":0.9,"created_utc":1678493036.0},{"title":"I don't know what I am feeling.","author":"NegativeParticular99","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TrueOffMyChest\/comments\/11olwo4\/i_dont_know_what_i_am_feeling\/","text":"Me and my boyfriend have been dating for almost a year already or to be specific, 10 months. For the first few months, he was really head over heels for me and I showed the same energy too. He did things that may not be forgivable for others, but as someone who\u2019s positive, I believed that he would change. Don't get me wrong, he really changed that one bad trait of his. And while our relationship lasts longer, he has always been in the wrong since he's new to really committed relationships. But, I do not like whether I am right or wrong. I like that we fix things and I don't really care if I'm right or wrong because if I were wrong, I would choose to admit it right away. And I don't raise my pride just so I can win an argument. I stand by with what's right and everything and he gets that. \n\nEver since he's been back to school, he always had hectic schedules since it's a Science Senior High School. I would always try to help him out because he easily gets frustrated. \n\nOne day, he took someone home without telling me (it was one of his friends from his old school)and what tore my heart is his friend\u2019s grandmother thought they were dating. The friend does not like him but him not telling me he took a girl home without me knowing because commuting is hard is what hurts me. He had all the time to update me but did not update. When I got mad because he did not even ask permission from me, he insisted on a break up and I said yeah okay but after a few hours he came back to me saying he's sorry.  \n\nI'm writing this because he changed a lot. I was used to his clingy side, where he would always flex me on social media and proudly say I'm his girlfriend. Now, he doesn't even post me and posts other people more, yet he's not cold to me. Mixed signals. It's like he just loves me because I'm there. I'm the one who's chasing him all over right now. I don't know what went wrong, because I managed to stay mature throughout the situations we have been in.  I love him so much but thinking, I don't deserve this. I don't deserve this kind of treatment that you'll only show your efforts in the beginning only.","upvote_ratio":0.67,"created_utc":1678545904.0},{"title":"My partner is driving me nuts","author":"Electronic_Fox_2708","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TrueOffMyChest\/comments\/11olure\/my_partner_is_driving_me_nuts\/","text":"English is not my first language so I apologize for any grammatical errors. I (27 female) and my husband (32 male) have been married for 5 years, and have a 2 year old daughter together. We have shared a bed almost every night since our first date, and never had any issues with bed wetting for the longest time. I found out over the years that his two adult brothers struggle with this heavily and sadly it is pretty evident it\u2019s an on going issue as each of their houses has a very potent smell of urine. I don\u2019t know if they do not notice anymore or if they have come tired to clean up so often. I did not think my husband had any issues with this, and then I found out that it was an issue up until he was 16. Then, in our first year living together it happened for the first and only time. He was clearly embarrassed and quickly cleaned up after himself and we pretty much never discussed it again. That is until recently. For background, I work 50-60 hours per week from home and I\u2019m currently pursuing my masters through an online problem at night. My husband works long hours away from home and is pursuing his masters on campus. Through this, I\u2019m my daughter\u2019s primary caregiver which I love but it means my schedule is very demanding. For the last couple of months, my daughter has been going through a sleep regression and my husband is a heavy sleeper so I usually wake up to take care of her. For the last three weeks, however, once I\u2019m finally able to get my daughter down (sometimes it takes many hours) I come back to bed and am woken up within an hour or two by my husband asking me to go sleep on the couch because he\u2019s once again wet the bed. To be clear, it has not been every night but almost every other day. I feel bad about getting so worked up, but it has been so frequent lately and I\u2019m exhausted. I have trouble sleeping to begin with and it is driving me insane to not be able to get a full nights rest. My husband always cleans up after himself and I can tell he\u2019s sorry and feels embarrassed but he refuses to see a doctor. It has been nonstop and quite frankly it\u2019s all I can think about whenever he tries to be intimate. I don\u2019t know what to do. How did this not happen for years and all of a sudden it\u2019s such a frequent issue?I\u2019m so close to telling him that he needs to sleep in the bathtub, and I feel like the worst person for even thinking it. He\u2019s wonderful and I love him, I just need this to be over with. Am I the only one going through this? Is this normal in male adults? I must be missing something.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678545766.0},{"title":"my sister is gonna ruin her own life","author":"PracticeImaginary832","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TrueOffMyChest\/comments\/11o9zmd\/my_sister_is_gonna_ruin_her_own_life\/","text":"I (19F) have a younger sister (17F) who is currently a senior in high school. For the past year or so, she\u2019s been the \u201cproblem child\u201d, and having a LOT of mental health issues that my parents have dealt with while I\u2019ve been away at school. \n\nShe\u2019s run away multiple times, she gets violent against us when angry, she steals large amounts of clothes frequently, she\u2019s high out of her mind 24\/7, she snuck out to bars in the nearest large city, has totaled her car, she skips school while failing all her classes, and has begun experimenting with psychedelics on the regular. \n\nShe\u2019s thrown heavy objects at my mom, tried to choke my mom, tackled my dad, punched holes in my door, and beaten the crap out of me on many occasions.\n\nObviously, this behavior has been super scary for me and my parents, and I spend basically all my free time worrying about her well being. I love her a lot and just want her to be safe. \n\nThe issue here is after her prom, she plans on spending a weekend in a rented house in a beach town, pretty common around me. She has told me that when there, she plans on trying cocaine that someone is bringing. \n\nI think this is a terrible idea because of the fentanyl issue going around currently And because she has a very addictive personality and I see this as a step down a very dangerous path for her knowing how she\u2019s reacted to these things in the past. \n\nOn the other hand, the after prom weekend is something every senior looks forward to. I don\u2019t want to make her be the only one of her friends to not go, and I know that if she isn\u2019t allowed to go, my parents could potentially face violent wrath. And my therapist thinks that at some point, this cannot be my problem anymore. Once she goes to college next year, I have no control over her actions any more. And that absolutely terrifies me. \n\nI feel like she\u2019s gonna get herself killed on of these days. Between the drugs and the drinking, the way she drives (not sober may I add), the amount she steals, and her irrationality when she\u2019s angry, one day she\u2019s gonna face some real consequences. But it only takes one mess up to end it all. \n\nI know I\u2019m not her parent, and it\u2019s not my job to oversee her decisions. But she\u2019s not even an adult, and this seems serious to me. I don\u2019t think the people around me want me to snitch, but that\u2019s what my gut is telling me. \n\nMy parents themselves are completely tired. She\u2019s broken them. I\u2019ve never seen people in such defeat. My mom had told her that she hates her. That is an awful thing to say to your own kid, but despite her apologies, it still feels like the truth. \n\nI just want my sister to stay alive.","upvote_ratio":0.83,"created_utc":1678506758.0},{"title":"it might be my fault that a kid ran away","author":"bakedmiddlebean","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TrueOffMyChest\/comments\/11olgfo\/it_might_be_my_fault_that_a_kid_ran_away\/","text":"I gotta get this off, I feel so guilty  \nit's at least partially my fault; apologies if the title is a misleading\n\n(this is my alt account for personal things; I don't wanna associate with my main)\n\nTW: mentions of intended self harm \/ unaliving themself and others (none committed) \n\nso this kid, he's my classmate. junior college. we'll call him ZH. I've talked about him before. somewhat problematic. he's accused of a lot of things, none of them good.\n\nI've called him out on his bullshit before, reported it to the teachers, made posts accusing him of shit, the whole thing. bad blood between us, we hate each other.\n\nanyway, most of the class ignores or actively hates on him. if he sees me outside of class he'll literally take off running the other way.\n\n\/\/\n\n\nso one Sunday night he starts posting some worrying shit. like, more worrying than normal (normal for him). talking about offing himself and all that. saying \"don't contact me after 9\", he's also posted his full address up on his status. messages to him are not getting through either.\n\nso we're all concerned, because this kid is known for being Not Okay. me and a close friend (let's call them Sauce) make a group chat with our maths teacher and spam text him info. he says he'll look into it. we get told they called his parents and it turns out he's fine!! just frustrated. I think, okay, and move on with my life.\n\nthe next day he's not at school. we get pulled outta class and they (the school people) ask if we know where he is.\n\nI'll cut the long story short, they found him Tuesday hiding out somewhere. alone, and probably hungry, but otherwise in good condition (alive). he's back in class last Thursday and won't talk to us (expected). \n\nand this week he's not in school again, apparently suddenly off to live with his aunt in another country for a while. he's been talking about knives that he allegedly stole (why are they letting him have sharp things?) but he's alive and kicking. very literally.\n\n\/\/\n\nand this is the part where I talk about me\n\nI can't help but feel guilty.

I hear him screaming and the dog yelping. My grandmother in law runs downstairs to see what's going on. He just keeps screaming \"stupid bitch\" and I hear more yelps. Everything goes quiet for a minute, then she comes back upstairs and tells my wife and I that his dog just either tried to or did bite somebody outside. She couldn't tell what he was saying because he was shaking angry. She said to us \"I think the dog is going bye bye\". She said he dragged her into his bedroom and slammed the door refusing to talk about it anymore. \n\nThe dog is a pit bull with a history of violence. She's not fixed since he doesn't want her to be fixed for whatever reason. She's bitten people in the past and just recently bit a friend of our family to the point where he bled. She's aggressive towards other animals (2 cats) in the house for no reason. When we try to leave, she nearly attacks us and tries to bite, so we have an electric shock collar that we HAVE to use or she will hurt us. She got into a dog fight last year, which wasn't her fault since the other dogs were unleashed on our property, but she still could've easily killed them. She even chased a group of children a couple of months ago.\n\nMy uncle in law does not socialize her properly. He barely even takes her outside to use the bathroom enough. She isn't housebroken and he won't clean up after her when she does go in the house. She was crated 24\/7 for a good portion of her life before he lived with us. \n\nI don't have any authority over his dog, but I just feel like he should give her up for adoption or get her training if her biting is even reversible at this point. She's 4 or 5 years old and only seems to be getting more aggressive. Sometimes she bites one of the cats and he yelps. \n\nI haven't spoken to either one of them today so I'm still not sure what happened but I don't think she's gonna go anywhere. I don't think he's gonna do anything about this and just keep kicking her whenever she does act up. I don't know what to do about the situation even though it's not my animal. I guess just deal with it? Make suggestions to him? He won't listen anyway. \n\nI'm just worried about the dog.\n\nEDIT: Of course I'm worried about other people and animals, as of right now I'm worried the dog will be beat more. I think she's ok and he's calmed down but still.","upvote_ratio":0.43,"created_utc":1678544030.0}]
