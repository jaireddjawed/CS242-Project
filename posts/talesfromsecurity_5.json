She calms down after a bit and we ask what was wrong and she said \"There is a old guy in there!\" and points at the stall she ran out of.  So we hear over and open the door and...nothing there.  \n\nWe both think that she just got spooked from hearing someone in the next one over and head back over to here to let her know there is nothing there.  \nShe looks my partner right in the eye and says \"He's in there!  I saw him!\".  It takes a second for it to click before we realize what she meant by \"*In There*\".\nSo we head back over, open the door and use our flashlight to open the lid and sure enough there's a shit &amp; piss covered 30-something year old guy that looks like the worst smurf ever.  Partner gets out his taser and has him get out and lay on the ground while i'm paging Metro to get a cop down here.  \n\nFew minutes later and both of us trying not to spew our lunch and the cops show and the first one takes one look at the guy on the ground and shakes his head and heads back to get his partner and they both come back gloved-up.  \n\nThey cuff him and take some photos and then find the nearest hose and spray him down as best as they can before stuffing him into the back of their car.  About 20 minutes of statements &amp; papers later they are back in their car and head off to the Jail with every one of their windows completely down.\n\nWe ended up getting a extra person for each shift after that just to stand near the johns.  \n\n\n**TL;DR : Worked at Fairgrounds, Shitty Smurf-Man hiding in the toilet goo scared a little girl out of the Port-a-Johns.**",

I'm sitting in my car, vaping and listening to tunes and I hear rocks being thrown a ways down from me, so I get out and check what the ruckus is, and I kid you not its a 40ish male throwing rocks in the air trying to hit birds. \"Great, I try to walk up to him he's chucking one towards me\" I think to myself. He will be known as HM and ME as myself.\n\nMe: \"Excuse me sir why are you wandering on the active train tracks?\"\n\nHM: \"those damn birds tried to take my backpack!\" \n\nMe: \"Well I don't believe they would have enough strength to take that from you.\"\n\nHM: \"F*** off and kill those birds!\" \n\nMe: \"I'm going to call the police if you don't leave the property sir, please follow me to the road.\" \n\nHe followed me but not before trying to climb train cars and falling back down to the nice hard rocks at the bottom, anyways he finally left on down the road. \n\nTl:Dr; Hobolo tries to kill birds, then stunt off a train car.

Im halfway around the property when my main torch flashes twice indicating low battery, so I think to myself, no issue I have a backup. Pull out my backup and it doesn't even spark, no batteries in it great. \n\nTurns out my SO needed batteries for our tv remote and took them out of my backup light.

        "text": "QUICK EDIT: I would like to add that at no point in my past (this story included) was I or am I a police officer. I'm a security officer.\n\nAdmittedly, this story occurred in 2009/2010 while I was working with the police department during a college Commencement event. The officers at the PD LOVED me and considered me another officer; I ate with them, I took breaks with them, and I worked the line with them. Three of them even told me \"You're one of us\" while I worked with them; one year later I would work riot control with them as they worked to show their presence during the building of a potential riot; we had three departments providing support at the time and I felt honored I got to be part of it since I was not a LEO myself. That in itself is a story for a different day (which I will of course post) but this is the story of my very first arrest as an officer.\n\nI'm a big guy (6'5\") and I'm even more imposing while I'm wearing my boots and a suit. All of these were true at the time; I am still currently a large imposing figure but my badge now says \"Chief\" on it. I don't have as much to worry about any more but the safety of my people is paramount.\n\nAnyway, I was walking the line and talking to the individuals that were about to graduate. I knew some of the people who were graduating so I stopped for a couple of minutes to talk to each of them. It was important to me that I not only knew the individual that was about to walk across the stage but that I also knew their motivation and who was going to be rooting for them when they crossed said stage.\n\nI came across an obviously drunk individual holding a wine bottle and said calmly \"Hey, you should either place the wine bottle back in your vehicle or throw it away\". He started running his mouth and going off on a tirade on how he was going to kick my ass and yadda yadda yadda. I reiterated what I said prior and added \"If you do that now we can forget this ever happened and you can walk across the stage\". I thought I had given him an out and I was waiting for him to take it. Fate, however, had other ideas and the reality of the situation soon kicked in.\n\nHe swung at my head. Not only did he swing at my head but he happened to be holding a full wine bottle as he did it. I blocked his swing and took him down; my left knee rode his back to the ground and my right knee unfortunately bounced off the concrete. I had him in custody before he had time to process what had happened. Two of my police buddies saw this guy swing at me and came running. They got him in cuffs while I held his arms behind his back and immobilized him.\n\nThe three of us pulled him off the ground and my buddies carted him off to jail. He went down for \"Assault with a Deadly Weapon\" and I think they tacked on something about assaulting an officer because they liked me and I was the one that had been attacked.\n\nUnfortunately my right knee had bounced off the ground and I hadn't noticed what had happened due to the sheer adrenaline of the moment. One of the detectives said \"Hawk, are you okay?\" and it was only at that time I had noticed I was limping. I worked the rest of my shift (albeit on soft duty) and we all made sure the rest of the day went off without a hitch.\n\nAnd lo, my friends, that is the tale of my first arrest.",

        "text": "This happened last month. I'd been working night shifts at Apple in Cupertino. Usually there is absolutely no one around, it's deserted, and even the people working late don't hang around after 9 or so.  Around 2 AM I'm driving around (the place is huge) and notice this guy in a parking lot really struggling to carry something huge, but he's not headed anywhere because there weren't any cars in the lots at all. He's just walking straight into this former brownfield site wasteland with like 8 monitors in his arms. I pull up to him and he immediately panics and drops everything he was holding and starts running. All the monitors break, lol. I run after him because, well, I was bored of just sitting all night and running would just feel good. So I catch up to him and grab his arm, a little worried he would have some kind of knife or something, but he just turns around and calmly tells me he's an employee.  I ask to see his security badge and sure enough, he has one and it is not temporary/contract even it is the real deal. I ask him what he was doing with all those monitors and he told me he was in charge of inventory and they were going to be tossed anyway.  I didn't believe him but I had to let him go because he had a badge and I really didn't want to get fired or something if he was a high-up.  I told him I would have to report his name the next day anyway just in case. He nodded and was very calm. He didn't have a car or anything and I asked him how he was going to get home and what he was going to do with the monitors. Then his mood completely changed and he got very upset, wouldn't answer any questions and got combative. He kept trying to touch my forehead with his finger and I told him if he kept doing that I'd tase him.  Then he said \"I have to do more work now,\" walked back across the lot to his building, and went inside using his badge. As he passed the pile of monitors he kicked him but didn't pick any of them up.  \n\nI drove away and felt really weird about the whole thing.  The next day I reported the incident but it turned out he was in charge of inventory, was a long time employee, and that the monitors were scheduled to be thrown out. Today, one of my friends on day security whose girlfriend is an employee told me he was fired last week though, because he wasn't supposed to take the monitors even though they were going to be thrown out. *Shrugs*",

One I had to place in the morgue and the other 4 I had to help funeral homes with pick ups. It dawned on me granted they used to be alive they are no more and can not hurt me or anything like that and they can't argue. I honestly felt relaxed and found it to be easier when talking to them even though they can't hear me. I think I am going to be just fine at this post. So thanks everyone who gave advice.",

Usually I'm in one of the internal areas walking around &amp; keeping an eye on things/people but this time I was down on the pitch level, initially at one of the gates leading from the crowd stands to the football field. Today is a regional game instead of an international one, so the crowds are all contained to one stand. Right when the first game starts &amp; the ball boys (kids who bring the ball out to the pitch for the game) come out, this frantic little 10 year old runs down to my gate and starts talking frantically at me, saying, 'I'M THE BALL BOY, I'M THE BALL BOY'. I just keep looking at him, because I have no idea what to do. Then, he starts pointing to a part of a jersey he's wearing, obviously just a run of the mill jersey with a team logo on it or whatever trying to convince me it's somehow valid accreditation. Stupidly, but whilst keeping an eye on the kid, I mention who the kid says he is to a nearby official, and he just sarcastically replies 'I would be very surprised', without even looking at me. The kid eventually buggers off.\n\nRoughly 2 hours later, I'm moved to a stand to deter people (kids really) from jumping it and running onto the field. I meet the SAME kid, who's been going from gate to gate telling porkies to the guards there and he asks me if he can get to the pitch. I tell him obviously no, and he says 'HEY HEY, LISTEN. Take this and forget about it'. He reaches into his pocket and pulls out 10 bucks and tries to give it to me, whereupon I instantly burst out laughing.",

        "text": "On mobile so please forgive the crappy formatting. \n\nA few years ago I worked security for the mall downtown in my city. Being downtown and right next to the bus terminal we saw a lot of shoplifters, young teenagers and homeless (which wouldn't be a problem but they liked to defecate in the back hallways for some reason...the homeless that is, not the kids)\n\nAnyway, we had this one group of kids that would come in every day, skipping school and trying to be as loud and disruptive as possible to get attention. Of course their behavior eventually got them all banned from the mall. The only problem was that they didn't give a shit and would come in every day anyway, only now when they came in a bunch of security guards would chase them out...turns out this is exactly what the kids wanted, (who woulda thought) to be chased around the mall by a lot of overweight security guards and never actually get kicked out. This could literally go on for hours every day. Eventually I started to think the guards looked forward to trying to chase all the kids out. So it was a never ending cycle...until one day. \n\nIt was the usual deal, the lead guard of the day came over the radio and told us to start looking for the banned kids as they were seen in the mall. By this time, I was pretty over this hide and seek bullshit but it just so happened I found the kids right after they told us to start looking for them. So, I hear them start laughing because they think I don't see them or something, until I say \"Yeah, I see you and know who you are. I just don't really care.\" and proceeded to stay where I was, looking over the balcony to the ground floor. They instantly stopped laughing and stood their awkwardly. A few minutes later, they all leave the mall on their own. Like magic. Turns out they only stayed around because they thought being chased around was funny. (It was kinda funny)\n\nHope this post was mildly entertaining, if not as exciting as some posts on here.\n\nTldr: kids banned from the mall won't stay out",

Well part of my detail is dealing with the dead. I have been in many a morgue in my time so this should not be anything new to me. Well this \"morgue\" or dove room as they call it is way different than anything I have dealt with before. Instead of it being vault style it is a stand alone unit that can hold up to two bodies at once. Meaning if you have more than two bodies you have to rotate them every 4 hours. For some reason this part of the post has made me feel extremely uncomfortable. I get it people die and the dead can't hurt you , but every time I go in there I get this real uneasy feeling. Furthermore since this is a stand alone model cooler you have to use what is basically a transmission lift to move the body to the cooler. Any advice on how to cope or get over this ? Don't get me wrong I enjoy my new job the pay is good and easy to move up the ranks. Does anyone else have any experience in this field ?",

        "text": "Hello r/talesfromsecurity! It's been a couple weeks, but I was feeling froggy, so I figured I would write a tale that happened just last night actually. u/ButchStMagnus was present for this one, and boy was it a wild ride! In reality, the incident itself wasn't too bad, however, we were fucking terrified. Here goes.\n\n\nOur staffing has been cut again; now we're down to two officers and one supervisor. This means there's only two people to respond to any given situation, and that's if the supervisor isn't tied up on something else. Utter bullshit, and a serious officer safety concern, but admin doesn't like spending money where they can get away with it. \n\nI'm working at the dispatch post, its around 1530, and I'm set to leave at 1600. Super boring day, and we have a fill-in officer so I'm stuck working dispatch all day. This dispatch post duals as an information/security window at the entrance to our ED. A guy pulls up in an older looking Ford pickup, and walks in kind of frantic.\n\n\"Hi Sir, what can I do for you today?\"\n\n\"Uhh, My buddy is out in the truck and he's detoxing from something. Can I use a wheelchair to help get him inside?\"\n\n\"Absolutely. Let me know if you need help, partner.\"\n\nOh great, I'm thinking, another freaking drunk. I hate dealing with drunks. I mean, I like being drunk, but I don't like dealing with them sober. \n\nOur fill-in (FO) makes his way into the security office to await the oncoming shift so he can skedaddle on home, and I'm doing the same. On this particular day, our supervisor decided to call in an additional officer early since he had meetings planned all day. She was off doing a patrol, seems how she had to stay until 0000. \n\nI remember seeing the guy that was 'detoxing' being wheeled in, however I never saw the signs of what was to come with him. He just kind of looked like a short, bald, fat guy with a hell of a scruffy stubble going on. He got wheeled in, checked in, blah. Thought that would be the end of it. Approximately 5 minutes after he was checked in and taken to the back, I got two phone calls.\n\n\"Security, this is RentABacon.\"\n\n\"Hi, uhh, this is triage. Can you send someone to the ambulance bay please?\"\n\n\"They're on their way. Hold on.\"\n\nSecond phone call went:\n\n\"Security. RentABacon.\"\n\n\"We need some officers in psych. Now!\"\n\n\"They're en route.\"\n\nSo since FO was in the office, I told him to respond to the ambulance bay, and I would send the other officer (OF2) to the psych area. (These areas are linear to each other, so I assumed it was a mental patient trying to escape.)\n\n\"Patrol 2, dispatch. Start towards psych area, ED. Possible elope, unknown if combative.\"\n\n\"Patrol 2 copies. I'm on my way.\"\n\nI should also mention at this point that we were in the middle of a computer fuckall, and that I had no eyes on what was happening back there.\n\n\"Dispatch, FO. Code 4 at the Ambo bay.\"\n\n\"FO, Patrol 2. Meet me in room XX stat.\"\n\n\"Copy.\"\n\nNow I'm really curious. It's about 1550 now, meaning the other shift should be walking in at any moment. \n\n\"Dispatch, has anyone from the next shift arrived yet?\"\n\n\"A-firm. One member.\"\n\n\"Send him back.\"\n\nIronically, it was u/ButchStMagnus that had unfortunately walked into the office, arriving for his 1600-0000 shift. After I told OF2 that he was here, he turned and gave me the absolute filthiest look I had ever seen. In that split moment of eye contact, I realized he didn't want to be my friend any more. He rolled his eyes, turned,  and just short of stomped his way back towards the psych area. (Sidenote: He's not insubordinate or anything, in fact, he's one of the best officers. He just happens to get the 'fuck-you' end of the stick in most situations.)\n\nSo, this means we're now at 3 people back there, dealing with god knows what.\n\n\"Dispatch, Patrol 2. Start additional officers as they come in.\"\n\n\"Copy.\"\n\nFuck that! I want to join in on whatever is going on, now! About three minutes late on the dot, the last swing shift officer comes through the door. I tossed him a spare radio with the simple statement of, \"Cameras down. Watch the window. Going to deal with stuff.\" and I headed back to see what the commotion was about.\n\nI walk into the Psych area and I see our three officers, a doctor, and a medical scribe all around the dude that was 'detoxing'. We're gonna call him BMF(BigMotherFucker). BMF wasn't just sitting on his bed getting medical treatment, he was consistently tensing up, screaming, and head-butting the fucking wall as hard as he could. He was about 5'11\", and maybe 250 lbs. Really big dude, and really fucking pissed. So, there's four of us officers now circled up around him, waiting for him to charge. He's staying in the room for now, so we just wait, poised, ready to pounce.\n\nOF2 walks over and picks up a phone and calls our supervisor, telling him we're gonna need some help in psych now. He starts our direction. We were also told by medical that they called the police as well, due to this guys massive size. We were trying to hold out until the cops got there, given we were just security guards and the fact that it's a lot less paperwork if the cops tased him. Our captain walked around the corner and immediately went to the front of the crowd to talk to BMF. Assume all statements made by BMF are in a very angry, pissed of tone.\n\n\"Hi sir, my name is *captain*. What's going on today?\"\n\n\"I'M ANGRY. GET AWAY FROM ME.\"\n\n\"Okay, okay. *steps back* We're just trying to figure out why you keep hitting yourself on the wall. We don't want you to hurt yourself.\"\n\n\"ARGHHHH!\" *smash smash, sits back down on bed*\n\nYep, we're gonna end up in a throwdown with Big John here, any minute. Please God, let the cops get here soon. Captain backs off a little bit, looks at me and u/ButchStMagnus.\n\n\"I want to wait for the cops to get here, obviously, but if he hits his head on the wall again, we're going to have to take him down. If I go after him, follow my lead.\"\n\n\"We got your back like a buttcrack, sir.\" (That part was in my head)\n\nBy now, there's 5 members of the security team here, a couple male nurses, two doctors, and other miscellaneous staff. A nurse also had what we like to call the B-52 (Ativan, Haldol, and Benadryl) in a needle, ready to put BMF out like a light. Still waiting on the cops. Captain approaches again.\n\n\"BMF, how about some medicine to help you feel better? You seem pretty upset, and we have some medicine that will help you relax.\"\n\n\"NO. BACK OFF! I MEET AGGRESSION WITH AGGRESION!\" \n*Stands up* ARGHHHH--\n\nBefore he could hit himself on the wall again, Captain charged him, wrapping up in a full on bear hug-\n\n\nI yell, \"GO GO GO!\"\n\nAbout six of us jump on BMF. Captain did a great job tackling him onto the bed, however BMF had him in a front headlock. Butch and I immediately grab BMF's arm and wrench it up to allow our Captain to free his head. I have his right arm, one hand on the wrist, one on his upper forearm. I'm a portly fellow, but it was taking all of my strength and body weight to keep just his arm pinned down. Fighting BMf's stupid strength, it takes maybe two minutes for the other staff members to place the leather restraints on the bed and wrench him down. \n\nOh yeah, the police showed up. One officer. After we had BMF wrenched down to the bed, he walks up and says, \"Sir, I'm a police officer, I'm giving you an order to calm down and cooperate with these people..\"\n\n\"I DON'T GIVE A FUCK IF YOU'RE A COP, I'LL STILL KILL ALL OF YOU. LET ME GOOOO!\"\n\n\"Well okay, then. Call us if he has to come out of restraints and hasn't calmed down.\" \n\nSo, BMF is now restrained to the bed, administered his \"Shut the Fuck Up\" needle and is starting to get really drowsy. I lied, by this time he was out fucking cold. \n\nCaptain suddenly pipes up-\n\n\"Has anyone seen my glasses?\"\n\nAlas, nurses, doctors, scribes, medics, and techs could be heard-\n\n\"My glasses!\"\n\n\"Oh No!\"\n\n\"I can't see without my glasses!\"\n\n\"Where are my glasses?\"\n\nHe found his glasses almost unscathed, apart from being slightly bent. He rolled his eyes at everyone and promptly walked off.\n\nAhhh healthcare security. How I'll never miss you. \n\n",

Its a dangerous job so we have firearms and everything you can think of on a duty belt. One night I attempted to go into work, but my car wouldnt start because the battery died. So I called a tow truck to give me a jump. At this time im waiting outside my house next to my clean car in my full armed uniform. Next thing I know a beat up honda civic with a security sticker pulls up. Inside the vehicle was a security guard with no uniform.  He then asks me ir the vehicle was mine. I of course told him yes and that my battery died and I was waiting to get a jump. He then says he received multiple complaints about a guy standing near an abandoned vehicle.  He then says \"yeah im gonna have to call a tow truck and impound your car\" I immediately say \"the fuck you're not! Otherwise there's going to be rounds fired\" the guard then looks at me and says \"oh shit you're armed\"  after some minor banter he drove off. Shortly after that I got my jump and I went to work.",

I guard a lumber yard and essentially make sure theres no fire, not so much vandalism or theft (out of the way industrial area fenced in barbed wire). So i dont expect anybody to show up while i work. I was sitting reading my book and was going to do a patrol soon. I guess the guard who trained me also got called in closer to the time i would be off duty just to go over the lockup and alarming process. Anyways he must have used the back entrance (this yard is huge) and I have no cameras available for me to use. He also used the back door with his key and he walked into the building. I heard the noise of the door closing but I just thought it was crap outside because the sites loud. So he walks behind me and i heard those footsteps and when I turned around all I could see was his silhouette facing me. This all happened really fast but as soon as i turned around i let out a shriek of terror (like a girl) it was the only noise that came out. He started dying laughing and said he hoped thats what i would do...He has access to the security cameras which also have audio. Im sure the rest of the company is going to see that too.

        "text": "This story is so difficult to tell without just laughing at the ultra fail on my department's half. Just a little background: the party mentioned in this story that we ended up in an altercation with is the same party in my co-worker's story u/Bass_tapdiddle. \n\nSince we knew this patient would be a major pain in the ass, he was so lucky as to get his very own security officer sitting outside his door 24/7. He had proven to be violent once already, and we knew he was a huge flight-risk.\n\nSince I'm a filthy daywalker now, my shift typically runs from 0800-1600. The entire day went smoothly, I did some training with a new employee at our dispatch post, while my co-worker patrolled in the ER. We typically don't see too much of the supervisor on day shift, since he's mostly doing admin type stuff and being pretty.\n\n1200 rolls around, and el captain finally surfaces to give lunch breaks. I told him to let my co-worker go first, since she's been walking around all day, and then she can come switch posts with me. 1230 arrives, I go on lunch. All is still calm in the world. And by world, I mean the Psych area.\n\n1300, still nothing. I mosey on back to the Psych nurse's desk where my favorite paramedic is covering for the day. I ask him about our buddy, and what will happen when his 72-hour hold expires. P informs me that the patient's mental health hold will be renewed. \n\nFuck. The only word running through my head. This guy's going to snap and try to run for it, I just know it. After working in healthcare security, you start to develop that sense of knowing when people are going to try and do certain things. You start to notice things like body posture, if they seem nervous, eyes darting around, looking for exits, etc.\n\nI could already see this guy getting really tense (our psych patients are monitored via CCTV). He was giving me all of the signs that I described above. This fucker was going to run.\n\nJust a little bit more information: He was brought in by the local police department for ingesting meth and cutting the head off of his niece's guinea pig in front of her. He wasn't the type of psycho we were going to let escape from the facility. \n\nP told me to make sure I'm present around 1500, because that's when the hold will expire and the new one will be written. I acknowledged and went about securing shit.\n\n1455 rolls around, and I start making my way back to the psych area, because my gut is telling me that guinea pig murderer is going to pop off at any moment. I arrive and see the patient's doctor filling out the new form that was discussed. I asked P if the guy had been informed yet. He had, and he wasn't too happy. Oh boy, it's going to happen soon. Better get my wrastlin' boots on. I also double checked to make sure I had a pair of nitrile gloves tucked behind my handcuff case, in case he wanted to wrastle.\n\nI look at the camera, and see Guinea Pig Killer (GPK), come out of his room and start talking to my other officer, who was sitting 1 to 1 with him.\n\nGPK: You know I can leave, right?\n\nOfficer: No you can't. You know that.\n\nGPK: No, you don't understand. After my first hold expired, I was free to leave. I can leave now. I'm going to exercise that right.\n\nOfficer: No. Hold on, I'll get P to explain it for you. (Looks directly at me) \n\nMe: P, can you explain the situation to GPK again, I think he's still confused on how this is going to work.\n\nP: Sure, no problem, I'll talk to you in your room. \n\nThe patient then approaches the nurse's desk, which puts everyone on edge. I decide to step to his side, so that way I have sort of a tactical advantage should he try to bolt. The other officer notices and does the same on the opposite side. Good, at least this guy knows what he's doing. \n\nP: So, as I already explained, your doctor wrote another 72-hour hold. You can't go yet.\n\nGPK: See, that's where you're wrong. In the minutes proceeding the second hold being written, I was technically free to go, right?\n\nP: Technically. However, the second hold is already in place. You're not free to leave. \n\nGPK: This hold doesn't even apply to me! I'm a citizen that is sovereign from the laws and regulations of the state! I don't adhere to any of these standards! You can't keep me here.\n\nAhh, fuck. I quickly jump on my radio and request my captain (the only other available support) to meet me in the ER by psych, stat. He responds that he's up on another floor, but is en route. He was aware of the situation with this guy, so he wasted no time making it to my location. Captain comes in with gloves already on. \n\nCaptain: Sir, can you return to your room please?\n\nGPK: No. I'm going to leave! Like I said, I'm a citizen that is sovereign from the rules that you people adhere to. They don't apply to me.\n\nCaptain (after arguing back and forth with GPK for a bit): Your sovereign citizenship means nothing in regards to a state ordered mental health hold. I'm getting tired of arguing with you over this. You need to go back to your room. \n\nGPK kept inching further and further from his room, and it was obvious to all of us that this guy was just waiting for his opportunity to make a break for it. \n\nGPK: Well, I guess if you won't return my clothing items to me, I'll just have to leave the way I am. (In a hospital gown, no undergarments).\n\nCaptain: Look man, just go back to your fu--\n\nBOOM! GPK pushes my captain as hard as he can and starts to run up the hallway. Captain happens to be wearing his dress shoes, rather than his tactical boots. He takes one hard step forward in pursuit and falls. Hard. But, he managed to catch the guy's ankle and GPK starts sliding down the hallway. \n\nI'm in hot pursuit, GPK managing to make it to his feet and make a sharp left up the next hallway. I'm right behind him now, (He didn't think a big fella could move so fast) I grab him with my left arm, swing my right around him around and basically full on form tackle this motherfucker to the ground. Apparently, I had more forward momentum than he did. As we went to the ground, we hit once, GPK as my cushion, I slid over the top of him and his gown abandoned him and draped over my face.\n\nFuck! My first extinct is to grab a leg, an arm, his penis, whatever I can to ensure this psychopath doesn't escape! I start grabbing at anything I can make contact with. Aha! Yes! I got his leg. I wrap up on his leg so tightly, and I'm about to head-butt this guy in the back of the knee to make him fall. I then suddenly hear the slapping noise of feet on linoleum moving away from me, almost as if..\n\n\"You got me! You got me! let Go! It's me!\n\nAwww, Fuck! I  latched on to our other officer's leg, mistaking him for the patient. Nobody needs to know about this. Except for all of Reddit and my two co-workers that browse this subreddit. Fuckers.\n\nOnce my idiotic tactic of holding the leg of my fellow officer fails and I elect to not proceed that way anymore, the officer takes off in pursuit, as well as my captain and one other nurse. P and another nurse turned around and ran the other way, since the hallways make like a large rectangle pattern. Instead of following the herd behind the patient, I elected to follow P and the other nurse. I had plans to blindside this now naked, guinea pig slaying weirdo and hopefully concuss the bastard. \n\nI'm running up the hallway, about to make the turn when all I hear is a very shrill, \"AHHHHH, FUCK\". It's hard to type and accurately describe this scream. It was rather feminine, and more like a 6 year old little girl saw the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. But I knew it came from a man. If that makes sense?\n\nAnyways, I round the corner and see a tiny little red-headed nurse looking at me and pointing to what I assume was a dogpile on GPK, so he could be taken back to his room, restrained, and medicated. I round that corner and would you look at that? I was right. Dogpile!!\n\nI quickly jump into the fray, placing my right knee into the back of GPK's left knee, and holding his left hand down on the floor. Then I notice something strange. Wires. There's wires all over the floor. Whatever, doesn't matter. Captain seems overly stressed and pissed off at this guy now, adding a very audible, \"YOU'RE GOING TO JAIL NOW, MOTHERFUCKER!\" El Captain is also breathing super hard. Dude must be pretty out of shape, I suppose. Must be pissed that GPK made us work for it so much.\n\nCaptain: \"Cuff this sonofabitch\"\n\nCaptain slides me his cuffs. I put the left one on.\n\nMe \"Alright, roll over onto your stomach, give me your other arm.\"\n\nGPK: \"Really, man? Is all this necessary?\"\n\nMe: \"Yes. Now give me your fucking arm, or I'll force it.\"\n\nGPK: \"Alright, Alright. Fuck.\"\n\nHe complies, and I cuff his other hand. I noticed that the captain is now sitting back against the wall, still breathing super heavy. He's also holding his left arm kind of funny. What's with these wires? Where the hell did these come from? That's when it all started clicking in my head. \n\nMe: \"Cap, you alright?\"\n\nCaptain: \"Fuck no! You know how bad this hurts?\"\n\nHe holds out his left arm, and I see these two fish-hook looking silver things about two or three inches apart, dangling from his inner tricep. Oddly enough, they were attached to these stupid wires that were on the ground. It still hadn't quite clicked all the way, but when it did, I know I had the stupidest confused look on my face. He tased himself. \n\nMy captain, our leader, fucking tased himself. I couldn't believe it. All of the clues finally started making sense now. The shrill, girly scream that could be heard anywhere from within the ER. The weird wires that were all over the ground. The two fucking taser probes sticking out of his arm gave it away the most...\n\nAll in all, we got GPK back to his room. He sat in handcuffs until the local PD showed up to assess the situation (We have to call the police if there's a taser deployment). A familiar officer and hospital favorite responded with her supervisor and one other officer. They took our statements and watched the replay of the altercation. They laughed quite a bit at our mishap of a foot pursuit. We have to call them a lot, so they give us a lot of shit, all in good fun. \n\nGPK didn't get arrested, as it's not illegal to try and escape the hospital. He never actually punched or kicked anyone actively. He carried out another 72 hours, with no incident, and was then discharged. Free at last, to continue on with his campaign of smoking meth and decapitating furry little rodents. Ahh, what a life.\n\nThe captain was subsequently checked into the ER as a patient, to be seen for his battle wounds... He ended up surviving just fine. Turns out, as he was running up the hall, he pulled and deployed his taser... but it didn't fire. It had what's called a 'hang fire', where the cartridge deploys several seconds after the trigger is actually pulled. He ended up cornering GPK, at taser point, with it still not firing properly. He then attempted to drive stun the guy in the stomach, still with no effect. GPK knocks his arm back once again. \n\nThe taser fires.\n\n\nMy captain screams.\n\n\nGPK is tackled down the hall by P and another staff member.\n\n\nYou know the rest from there.\n\n\n",

        "text": "Hey TalesFromSecurity, long time fan and long time security officer. The following is a small story from when I was just starting as a security newbie. I had finally landed a job as a guard in a healthcare building after months of fruitless job searching and I was glad to have a source of income running. My coworkers were pretty cool and even the shift supervisors', while they were strict, they were fair and knew when to work and when to play. As for the job itself, every site where you have to interact with people will always have its ups and downs. This was one of those downs.\n\nThat afternoon I strolled into HQ a few minutes before the start of the shift to check where I would be posted that day. Checking the post roster I see that tonight I'm stationed in the ER. Fuck. I guess I have to hang around the serious stuff today. At least I get phone service there so I can pass some time on my phone so that's a plus. Hopefully there aren't any violent people in there today.\n\nAfter seeing a few of my shift coworkers come in I make small talk with them while the shift supervisors prod the previous shift supervisors about anything of importance that might be happening before they decide to sneak out with their belongings and rush to clock out leaving us without any knowledge of anything. I clock in and head over to the ER. Walking in I see the brunette nurse with a nice rack and plump ass sitting at the RN desk. Tiffany's her name right? I wonder what she looks like naked. Is she seeing anyone? As I walk by her I imagine myself bending her over the desk, pulling down the lower half of her scrubs, one hand on the back of her neck, the other hand on her hip,  inserting myself in, and going to town on that.\n\nSitting beside her is the registration clerk. I've talked to her before plenty of times. Really cool, down to earth, no nonsense chick. I greet both of them and walk over to the guard who I'm there to relieve. After getting the rundown from him, he goes and I make myself comfortable at the podium. Should be a nice, steady night. I check my radio with HQ. Everything's transmitting smoothly. Good thing since you never know when you might need backup. I check the waiting room and see that it's three quarter's full. Not too bad. I walk back over to my podium, take a seat and begin to mess around on my phone. I'm careful to use it out of sight and pause when I notice someone coming. You can never be too careful especially since I've heard this site seems to attract the type of people with a chip on their shoulder looking for any excuse to tattle on somebody for no particular reason. After half of my shift is done, I get relieved for a break and come back. About a half hour I hear it, the panic alarm button.\n\n\"Shit\", I'm thinking to myself as I walk over to the panel to check where the alarm is coming from. As I'm walking, the blaring sound of the indoor wall horns becoming as pleasant as a car alarm going off at 3 in the morning when you have to wake up at 5am and you've only been asleep two hours. I reach the panel and it reads: Zone 20. Where the fuck is Zone 20? I get a call on my phone and it's one of the nurses from inside. They're telling me they need help with a patient. Shit, guess it's the real deal. I grab some gloves and head in. When I get to the area I see a skinny guy on the floor flailing and screaming like the devil was after him with 3 nurses and our undercover cop holding him down. I immediately follow their example and get down and hold onto this dude's left leg. After a little bit, the guy calms down and we get him back into the stretcher. I walk back to my post thinking that's that. Boy was I wrong. About a half hour later the alarm goes on again as well as another call. The same guy is screaming bloody murder again and flailing about. I call for backup and wait till someone arrives. 2 Sgts and the Lt. show up and we restrain this dude and tell him to calm down until he stops screaming. We find out that the dude's a psych patient and he has to have a doctor evaluate him as well as a crisis worker before he can be transferred out to a proper facility for his needs. Just great. In the meantime I now have to stay near this guy to hold him down when he decides to exercise his vocal cords. \n\nI end up having to repeat this process over a dozen more times throughout the rest of my shift. I end up being relieved before Screamo was transferred out though. Hopefully he got the help he needed and is doing better now.\n\n",

Psych (lets call him the philosopher) arrives and is straight away very strange.\nA little back story on the philosopher. He was brought to our facility because he cut his niece's guinea pig's neck with a dremel and then cut it's head off. Then he threatened a bird and attempted to hold a knife to his sister's throat.  \nSo intake with the the philosopher goes well, you know the norm, \n\"do you want to hurt yourself?\" \nthe philosopher: \"Me? God no never wanted to hurt myself.\"\n\"Do you want to hurt others?\"\nthe philosopher: \"No never others, well you know just birds and lizards.\"\nAwesome. This guy is a fucking serial killer.\nMe and /u/ButchStMagnus take turns sticking around the psych area as we are called to other things. Sometime later that night, both of us are called for an extreme combative arrival to another room. Just as we leave, the philosopher peaks down the hallway and bolts into another patient's room. /u/ButchStMagnus is notified and quickly makes his way to the room and grabs the philosopher by his gown and drags him back to his room. /u/ButchStMagnus sternly informs the philosopher not to do that again or he will be tied to the bed. For a time, this worked on the philosopher. However, about 45 min. later the philosopher attempts to talk to another patient in a room across from him. Again, /u/ButchStMagnus corals him back into his room. the philosopher states that there was mail for him in that room and he had things to do in that room. /u/ButchStMagnus then tells the philosopher if you have anything you need, you go through me GOT IT!\" Once more this seems to keep him in his room...until exactly the time when /u/ButchStMagnus and myself are busy on a call. the philosopher peaks out of his room then bolts into the room he claimed the mail was in. Myself and /u/ButchStMagnus fly into the room. Explain to the philosopher that he will now be a one on one watch and will only leave the room to use the restroom. Further if he attempts to even step one fucking toe out of his room will be tied to the bed. We placed restraints on the bed and I stayed behind until our sitter showed up. The following is some dialogue from the philosopher. \n\nWARNING BAT SHIT CRAZY STATEMENTS AHEAD\n\nMe: Do you understand that it is highly inappropriate to go into other people's rooms?\nthe philosopher: Yes well only if it is not the right insinuations.\nMe: No, the philosopher, It is never appropriate. How about if you had someone barge in on you in a hotel room. Is that something that would be ok?\nthe philosopher: Well no yes but under the right circumstances it would be good and...\nMe: No the philosopher that is weird and not OK.\nthe philosopher: I get it, I get it you don't believe me but its just this damn radiation coming from the walls you know I see you look at me like the guy with tin foil on his head *laughs* but this wall is and I knew that it was the same because the last time I came here it was like this. You know the floor is emitting an electromagnetic frequency like maybe 60 hertz. You don't feel that?\nMe: No, *smh*\nthe philosopher: May I go to the bathroom?\nMe: yes \nthe philosopher goes to the bathroom and comes back and starts with this shit.\nthe philosopher: Here is how time and space break down ok; so you have digital and analog information ya know that creates a singularity. Then those are going in a figure eight then you put in consciousness and that makes a trifecta which you can create anything with. These are the fundamentals of matter.

        "text": "About 2 years ago I was a floating security guard for a company that doesn't exactly have a sterling reputation for screening their employees for, you know, their levels of sanity. But for Christmas weekend I agreed to work 3 overnights at a commercial building for an area manager who was a crackpot himself. \n\nSo on the third night of the overnight I was working from 12am to 8 am.Around 4  am while I was stationed at the front lobby area of the building I heard keys jiggle and open a side door. I walked over to the area where I heard the door open and all I saw was a half drunk water bottle on the ground that wasnt there on my previous patrol of the ground floor. Concerned, I went right back to where I was stationed and gathered up all my stuff in case I had to run the hell  out of there. I work way too hard to die in a building where there's a LuluLemon office, I wasn't goin out like that.\n\nSo nothing happened for the next 2 hours and I calmed down. Around 6:30am this Road Supervisor startled me by jumping out of a random office like a bat out of hell and began screaming at me. He was yelling about how I failed as a security guard because I \"failed to investigate the water bottle\" that he left on the ground when he snuck into the building. I first asked him what the hell was wrong with him. Then I told him that there was nothing to investigate because if he used keys to get into the damn building, then he was obviously someone who had the right to be in the building, otherwise he would have keys. Secondly I told him that I am just a security guard, not a detective so he needed to pony the hell down. And then I asked him what type of psychopath must he be if he purposely hid in an office for 2 hours to scare and yell at somebody. He told me that he would be telling the area manager on me and then I told him that I would be going to HR on him. He left and when the shift ended I did as well. ",

We have a lot of home schooled kids here, and I have a feeling that that had something to do with what just happened.\n\nSo about five minutes ago I'm just sitting here watching netflix when this scrawny freshman walks up to the desk and hands me a little packet of daily vitamins. I am **ODK** and the Scrawny Freshman is **SF**\n\n**SF**: \"Uhh hey, I found some drugs in the bathroom.\"\n**ODK**: \"Oh... um... those are vitamins?\"\n**SF**: \"No those are drugs.\"\n**ODF**: \"Nah dude, trust me those are just dietary supplements; they're natural.\"\n**SF**: \"Ohhh...

(this is at 6:30pm, so unlikely to be anyone moving out the few remaining chairs/what have you). So I go outside to see what they're up to, car is at the rear of the building, only the woman is in it. Where the hell did the man go? \n\nThe woman gets out, I watch her pick up a CD off the ground that I'd seen earlier and think had fallen out of trash or something it was some shit like a conference recording from 2008 of like engine dynamics or something completely useless to the average person like that. She gets back in the car, sees me. I greet her thinking oh, it must be an employee or an employee's wife or something, bloke has gone in the back of the building. She super nervously says hello back then drives her car across the street and sits in it. \n\nWut?\n\nSo I go around the back to see where the guy went, all the doors are secure... I go inside, no one there, go back outside the back. RUSTLING FROM THE WOODED AREA BEHIND THE BUILDING!! \n\nI'm peeking through the leaves like some kind of stalker and see the dude kneeling, digging through the underbrush/leaves and pulling ? out and putting it into a bag/toolbelt. \n\nSecond wut?\n\nObviously these two jokers aren't employees at this point, so I watch him and eventually he comes walking out, what follows was so bizarre my mind was playing catchup the whole time;\n\n\"Ahhh I knew you'd seen me there, I told her... Did you ask her to leave?\" (referencing the woman, who had driven out of the car park to across the street)\n\n\"Nah, I never told anyone to leave\" (Pls don't bury me in the woods)\n\nHe proceeds to call/signal the woman back in. (Company property, but I'm still wondering what is going on so yeah I'm not about to prod him.)\n\n\"I had to crash in the woods a few days, I only arrived in [CITYNAME] recently, gotta wait for work. I stashed my tools in there, so I was digging them up... look, let me show you..\"\n\nHe walks to the back of the car, which is now with us (at this point all I'm thinking is... dude is better dressed/more presentable than I am, clean-shaven, doesn't look grimey, doesn't look homeless, yet he's been sleeping in the woods, wut?) pops the trunk, HUGE STACK OF TOOLS, BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT I FOCUS ON. \n\nRUSTY HAND-AXE, RIGHT AT THE TOP.\n\nPLS DON'T DRAG ME INTO THE WOODS WITH YOUR AXE MISTER. \n\n\"See I stashed these somewhere else!\" \n\nHA HA OKAY BUDDY! NICE! \n\nI'm not asking any questions at this point I don't give a shit bro, buildings empty, you can take your hand axe and put the windows in if you want. It's all on camera anyway, I'm not facing the judgement of Henry VIII for an empty building. \n\nDude starts thanking me immensely (gotta say, for a guy toting a rusty hand axe he was 10/10 friendly) gets in the car, they drive off. \n\nYou'd think that was the end of my adventure, but no, I wanted to investigate the woods to see whatever body parts I was going to find. \n\nInstead I found a pretty sick shelter that he'd strapped together from fairly decent branches that he'd clearly cut from trees and tied in a weird tipi-esque support structure then roped a tarp over it (tarp looked like it was a tent cover or something, which was weird since he left it... was pretty nice?) inside there was minimal garbage,a few plastic bags along with empty razor packages. Guy was urban Bear Grylls and I'd been in that area multiple times whilst he slept with his hand axe, neat. \n\nSurprisingly no body parts, not sure if I'm disappointed or relieved. ",

        "text": "Hey TFS.\n\nCasino employee here, but not exactly security. More like security's Big Brother (ah. ah ha ha.)\n\nI work in the surveillance department. Good job for me, as I just get to sit in a dark room and watch the cameras. I still get a lot of interaction with coworkers, as I average about a phone call every 3 minutes for an 8 hour shift, but no interaction with customers. I just watch them, and security deals with any problems that may arise. But this one is about the employees.\n\nUp in surveillance, we have a healthy dislike for most of the floor employees. We see everything they do, we talk with a lot of the supervisors frequently, and all of security pretty much constantly. Yes, we protect the employees from shitty patrons by catching it on camera and sending security over nice and quick, usually before the Pit Boss is even made aware. But we aren't friends with any of them. Actually, part of our employment agreement forbids us from being friends with any other employees because we may need to initiate disciplinary action on them.\n\nThis is the tale of The Purge. We call it the Purge because through it we replaced no less than 5 dealers, 1 pit boss, and 8 members of security, and 1 of those 14 had formal charges brought against them.\n\nLike all casinos, we have a lost and found. People turn things in, they go to this room. People could call in, ask if we had a certain item in lost and found, and security would go check. What tipped us off that something was amiss came when a customer called in asking about a specific phone. Lead Security supervisor (We'll call him Al) went into the room to check. Sure enough, we had it. Customer said they would be in the next day to collect it.\n\nCue the next day. Customer comes in, asks about the phone. One of the guards goes in to check. No dice. Phone isn't there. Customer complains that Al told her it was there. Customer is pissed. Obviously this makes it's way to the security manager, and the General Manager. They call Al in to ask him about it.\n\nNow, Al has worked here for awhile. He's never given either us in surveillance, or any of the management any reason to distrust him. So when he says it was there, no mistake, 100% certain, the phone described was an exact match (it had a fancy case, and they got the lockscreen picture right.) we believe him.\n\nAlright, time for an internal investigation. We have a little pinhole camera. There is a clock in that room. One of the other surveillance guys goes down on a night Al is working (because we know he will keep his mouth shut about what's going on) and install it in the \"6\" on the clock, looking at the lost and found. We decide on a period of 1 month to monitor that camera and document everyone who goes in, and if they carry something out in their hands, give it back to the customer at the desk which is in full view of the camera. \n\nWe watched for a month. We saw a total of 6 dealers go in there after hours, when security was not at the door (casino closed, they have other duties) and help themselves to a few items. All of this was recorded, documented, saved, and compiled. We also had a pit boss go in. Took a few hats, and some other small items. Again, documented and video saved.\n\nAs I said, 8 security personnel were also seen taking things. One of them (let's call him Steve, because he's a scumbag) was seen to take 12 phones over the course of that month. Now, these were new iPhones and Androids, which go for $6-700 a pop. Multiply that by 12, and you have more than $5000.\n\nSo, the month comes to an end. One by one, the guilty parties are called into the office to be interviewed by the GM, Security Manager, and one of the surveillance team for record-keeping purposes. They are told they can leave the interview any time, but are encouraged to come clean, as it would be better for them.\n\nNow, one of the dealers fessed up immediately. He had taken a beanie from the lost and found, and told us how he was trying to support his sick mother (true, we verified), himself, his wife, and 2 kids on a single income and couldn't afford a hat for the cold winter. He was made to return the hat, but the General Manager gave him a hat from the casino store, and only a writeup. He was grateful, but we can understand the circumstances. He had a good history with the company, and we could all understand the situation. (The writeup was off his file after a year, to nobody's surprise. He still works here.)\n\nThe other ones tried to deny it, demanded to be shown the proof of them stealing. All were refused (it's confidential. Nobody but the General Manager, Security Manager, Surveillance, or police can review any footage they like. Games Managers and Security Supervisors can review footage if it has to deal with a recent or ongoing incident.) Everyone in that room but the accused had seen the footage, and it left no doubt. They were promptly relieved of duty and escorted off the premises by Al and another guard.\n\nThe last guard though, the one with the cell phones? When he came for his interview, there was a police constable sitting there as well. The interview was conducted as normal,with the officer (who had seen the footage) asking questions as well. When he left the office newly out of the job, with was with the officer to his car, where he was provided with a subpoena for court on charges of theft over $5000. Not sure how that case turned out, as none of us were needed for testimony, just written statements. I'd imagine it was a slam dunk case though.\n\nSo, that was the Purge. If you guys want more, I have tons of stories from my time in surveillance. Customers do strange things.",

        "text": "This is at a former job that's no longer in the building.\n\nWhen the company moved in the main entrance door system was setup with mag locks and key cards and motion detectors with the cards in common with interior doors.  It was all controlled by a PC that talked over a cable to the door system hardware to updates settings.  Even interfaced with the elevator so you swiped your card for the floors you could get to. All very fancy and it worked well.\n\nUntil one night several managers on the exec/management/account/IT floor had things go missing.\n\nI'm not in security, we didn't have anyone dedicated to the purpose, but I had full access to the camera system.  It was setup to cover every entry and exit to/from every floor (all three). I was tasked with reviewing the footage.  I also had access to the key card management system.\n\nI found that a guy managed to wave something through the interior door gap of the main entrance after hours and trigger the motion sensor.  The setup was where the vestibule was unlocked with the key card reader in it.  Your card got you inside past the interior doors.  He then found a former employee key card left out at the reception desk (!!!!) and used it to get around the building.  It had access to most doors.\n\nIn summary, never rely on a door with a motion sensor and a gap after hours for your security.  You can be defeated by something as simple as a stick poked through.\n\nThe fix- hard lock the front exterior door and after hours access was moved to a side entrance at the parking lot.",

        "text": "Well, my trial post went pretty well, so here's a little background: My Co-worker (CW) and I work for a contract healthcare security company in a kind of sketchy part of town; one that has an unsavory love for methamphetamine and apparently only ever consumes two beers. If you've worked in a hospital, you know shit can get weird fast. So, that's why they hire private security to take the brunt of it. Here goes to my first full story and my second-ever post on Reddit.\n\nThis story still kind of boggles my mind at least the sheer coincidence of it. Starting off, our shift only consists of three officers and a supervisor. Generally speaking, two officers are at a post, one patrolling the emergency department (ED) and the sergeant walks around and causes hate and discontent wherever he sees fit. One post CANNOT be left unattended, as it's our dispatch post. The other post can be deserted if there is an emergent situation. I was working the non-important post, another boot officer working the dispatch post, sergeant in the ED, and our Lieutenant working with us to pick up OT. \n\nI was sitting at my post, being all innocent and harmlessly flirting with a couple of volunteers that were sitting in the same entrance that I was. The dispatch officer (who is conveniently the same officer that I will be collaborating with /u/ButchStMagnus) radioed to patrol 1(supervisor) that we had a report of a suspicious white male in the employee parking lot. \n\n\"Dispatch, this is Patrol 1, can I get a better description?\"\n\n\"Copy, Sir, caller advises suspicious white male, 6'0, wearing a black sweatshirt, blue jeans, carrying a guitar on his back and a black duffel bag. Caller also advises that the party is looking into car windows in the physician parking lot.\"\n\n\"Patrol 1, I'll be clear and headed in that direction.\"\n\n\"Dispatch, this is Patrol (Lieutenant). I'll also be clear and headed that way for a search.\"\n\n\"Copy, Patrol and Patrol 1 en route.\"\n\nI hear this over the radio and wonder why in the hell two supervisors would leave the ED unattended, since our psych ward is in there and conveniently right by a door (Genius, I know.) But I figure, Eh. What the hell. Maybe I'll get to tase and handcuff some fucker who is trying to break into a doctor's car. \n\n\"Dispatch, this is Patrol 4. I'll be en route to the parking lot as well.\"\n\n\"Copy, Patrol 4 en route to the employee parking lot.\"\n\nThe parking lot in question was down a set of stairs and out a door from me. My sergeant radioed me that he was starting a sweep from the West side of the lot, so I started from the East. It was dark outside at this point, so we all three had flashlights out, shining them in windows on the off chance the guy found an unlocked door of a car and crawled inside. We swept the parking lot twice, with negative contact.\n\n\"Dispatch, this is Patrol 1. Negative contact so far. Advise on any further updates. Responding officers to my 10-20.\"\n\n\"Dispatch copy.\"\n\nWe met up around the sergeant and he said that he was going to sweep the lot one more time, and that we could go ahead and clear back to our posts. The Lt. and I nodded and started walking together back towards the building.\n\n\"Patrol and Patrol 4, turn around, he's heading right in your direction.\"\n\nI told the Lt. that I'd take the lead (only to impress him of course) and I started to approach the man. Wait, what? What the fuck? This wasn't a man. This kid looks like he's 12. And there was no way in hell that he was 6'0. I'm 5'10 and he was shorter than me. \n\n\"Evening, Sir, mind if I talk to you real quick-like?\"\n\nK (Kid): \" Yes, Sir, what can I do for you?\"\n\nMe: \"We just had a report of someone matching your description looking into car windows and being kind of suspicious. Was this you?\"\n\nK: \"No, I just got dropped off by my dad. Wasn't me.\"\n\nMe: \"Alright, then- wait, what? Dropped off by your dad? Why would your dad drop you off in a hospital parking lot?\"\n\nK: \"My mom works here, and I'm staying with her for the weekend. I think he may have just dropped me off in the wrong place. I kind of just wandered around for a moment since I was lost. But I wasn't looking in people's car windows at all.\"\n\nAt this point, the Lt. and the Sgt. approached. I let them know of the situation, and then let them take the lead from there. The Lt. decided to just point him in the right direction and bid him a good night. Cool, probably just some old biddy of a nurse who saw a young kid with a guitar and assumed he was a crime-ridden heathen.\n\n\"Dispatch, this is Patrol 1. Positive contact, just a young kid who was lost. All officers returning to post.\"\n\n\"Patrol, Patrol 1 and 4, returning to post.\" \n\nAlright, well, that was stupid. I went back to my desk I was at and resumed my initial flirting attempts.\n\nNow, time lapse about an hour and a half later. I was still at the same post, but now the volunteers had left. So I resorted to watching the cameras in hopes of fast forwarding time. My attempts failed. The phone on the desk rang next to me. Hm, \"1234\" that's the number of the dispatch phone. \n\n\"Security, this is RentABacon.\"\n\n\"Dude, didn't you guys say that the suspicious guy from earlier was just a lost kid?\"\n\n\"Yeah, why?\"\n\n\"There's a guy in the ED waiting room matching the same description. Except this fucker looks overly homeless.\"\n\n\"Hm. Weird. Call the Sergeant and fill him in.\"\n\nI'm assuming he called the sergeant and informed him, but I actually have no idea. Sarge never approached the guy, so I really don't care. \n\nTime lapse another 30 minutes or so. Guitar guy number 2 had already been taken back and triaged. The dispatch officer called over the radio again:\n\n\"Patrol and Patrol 1, respond to the triage area and ED waiting room for a report of a disturbance caused by a patient. Staff would like him escorted out immediately.\"\n\n\"Patrol and Patrol 1, clear and en-route.\"\n\nHm. Interesting. I'll keep any eye on the situation through the eye in the sky. I see both the supervisors approach this guy, and start to talk with him. Sarge has a reputation with staff for how verbally-fucking-amazing he is. Dude really has a knack for being able to talk people down. A master of communication if you will. So, Sarge sits down to give this guy the business, and act like he actually gives a shit. Mind you, I'm only monitoring this via the CCTV, and I'm paying pretty close attention, because you never know how these situations will go. Especially if this guy is homeless.\n\nBlah Blah Blah...... Sarge is talking to him, and then I see Sarge promptly stand up, take a short step to the guy's shoulder, with the Lt. mirroring on the opposite side. They stand this guy up out of his chair, guitar and all, and start marching his ass straight out of the door. They get out in front of the ED entrance, and let go. I know they're saying things like \"Keep moving or we'll call the cops\", or \"Get the fuck out\" (We don't exactly always stay diplomatic). \n\nClosely watching the camera, I'm also ready to spring up and sprint across the parking lot, in case No-Home-Joe decides to roll with the Rent-a-cops. Or, he may leave peacefully. No one knows. Joe decides that he's going to try and pull a fast one on the commanding officers, and tries to simultaneously duck and spin under the Lt.'s arm and run back in the hospital; which I still don't get what he was trying to accomplish with that... I see the Lt. shove Joe back and immediately un-holster the only stimulant security is allowed to give out- Edison Medicine.\n\nFUCK YEAH! I'm up and out of my chair faster than ever and it's off to the races. (Now, I'm a heavier set fella. I don't move in the swiftest of ways, and I have a mid-range speed. I also have a fetish for gear flying off of my duty belt any time that I have to run.) I bolt out the door, and I'm off and running across the parking lot to hopefully see this asshole get tased. From where I'm at (about halfway) I can see Homeless Joe kneeling on the ground, throwing shit into his duffel bag and yelling some weird shenanigans. I slow my pace and approach sort of to his side, so he's basically cornered with his back to a fence. The Lt. is mainly speaking to him:\n\n\"Sir, just leave the property or we're calling the police.\"\n\n\" Maannnnn.... this is bullshit! I need a emergency!\"\n\n\"You've been cleared, and you can't act the way you are in our hospital. You need to leave now.\"\n\n\"Dude, I already called the FBI on you fuckin' assholes! It's a government conspiracy and it's bullshit!\"\n\n\"Sir, this is your last warning. Leave. Now.\"\n\n\"BRUH, I'm just saying-\"\n\n\"SHUT THE FUCK UP AND GET MOVING!!\"\n\n\"Damn, man! Chill!\"\n\nSometimes during the week, we would have a police officer that would be there from around 1800-0300. The particular officer this night just so happened to stroll outside during this little predicament. He walks up, crosses his arms, and basically just re-iterates what we were telling him; except this guy can actually arrest the weirdo. Essentially, it turned into \"Leave in five seconds or your ass is getting tased, hobo.\" He left. Or so we thought. I started walking back to my post, and turned to see if Joe had actually left. What I see instead befuddles me, even today. Joe is viciously assaulting a handicapped parking sign. Punching it, trying to pull it out of the ground, and I think he even head butted it once. I look behind and see that the other three are starting to head that way, so I do the same. We circle up around him, the Sgt. and Lt. with StreamLight flashlights on his face, me with my hand on my Taser. He went on rambling and rambling about government conspiracies and how we were basically the illuminati. Our boy in blue even stated one time, \"Dude, you're fucking mental. Get out of here.\" \n\nWhen No-Home-Joe (guitar guy#2) finally came to what little bit of sense he had left, he grabbed his shit and started leaving once again. We even heard a car blare its horn and slam on its brakes, as the dumbass crossed the intersection against the flow of moderate traffic. \n\nAs a final kicker, Sarge looked at Lt. as we walked back towards the building and smiled when he said, \"Welcome back to swing shift, motherfucker.\"\n",

        "text": "I just found out about this sub and was encouraged by a few other redditors to share a number of my experiences. Up front, this is going to be a long post with multiple stories. Some are sorta funny, some are tragic, one is flat out terrifying. I've told a few of these stories to friends but have never committed most, if any of these to Reddit before but here we go.\n\nFOR THE RECORD\nI worked at the House of Blues on Sunset in West Hollywood, CA from February of 2004 to just after Thanksgiving of that same year. Immediately following that I worked security at Barneys Beanery, also in West Hollywood, CA from that same Thanksgiving until March of 2005. All of the following events took place at these two venues. Other than a very short stint at a bar in Charlotte, NC, these two are the only security jobs I've ever had or hope to have ever again. \n\nHouse of Blues  \nAfter being hired at HOB I reported for my very first day of training/orientation. As I am walking up to work on this first day I see a mob of people out front. Not unusual except for the fact that this was at 2 in the afternoon and this mob were all reporters. Before I even get on work-property a number of these reporters bum rush me asking all sorts of questions that I couldn't even keep up with. I have zero idea whats happening. One of the HOB PR/Management ladies comes running out, grabs me, tells me to not answer anything and come on inside. Once inside I learn that the week before this during an NBA All-Star Game afterparty a rapper had stabbed a security guard in the neck with a broken champagne flute and I pretty much was filling his position. Gulp. \n\n[MTV news piece about that particular stabbing](http://www.mtv.com/news/1485324/loon-formally-charged-in-stabbing-as-new-details-arise/)\n\nOff to a fine start. Before we get into more nefarious territory here's a few lighter incidents that happened while working at HOB.\n\nFinger Puppets  \n1) During a Ministry show I was walking thru the pit on the floor and I happened to look up at the balcony above. The balcony railing is one of those slatted wood deals. Mind you, the music is loud as hell, its dark, and there's a crazy light show going on which created a strobe effect on the crowd. I double take at what I thought I saw in the balcony and just keep staring waiting for the strobe cycle to illuminate where I was looking again. And sure enough, I see it plain as day....there's a woman sitting right up against the railing, Catholic school girl skirt hiked up, finger-blasting the ever living BEEJESUS out of herself in time with Ministry playing Thieves. Yes, I let her finish because, well, it would've been rude not to.\n\nJACKASS  \nAnother night, a lot of the guys from Jackass were in the house to see Turbonegro or Cradle of Filth. (I cant remember which) Anyway, flash forward to the end of the show and we're slowly clearing everybody out. I'm right outside the back door poorly hitting on one of the concierge girls that worked the upstairs Foundation Room when I hear a bunch of people chanting inside. So I rush in to see Bam Margera climbing over the railing of the 2nd floor balcony with a crowd chanting \"JUMP, JUMP, JUMP!!!\" I didn't mention it before but this was my first night as Security Lead so I am freaking out that my first night in charge one of the Jackass guys is gonna jump on the crowd from the 2nd story balcony and paralyze somebody. I go hauling ass up the stairs and get to Bam before he jumps and bodily haul his ass back over the balcony railing. I mutter something about \"please god don't do some shit like this on my first night in charge.\" Bam laughs and sheepishly says to me, \"Thank god you showed up. I thought I was actually gonna have to jump.\"\n\nProtect Ya Neck  \nThose were fun. The rest of these, not so much. One particularly scary incident was the night Stiff Little Fingers played. Irish punk-band, rowdy crowd but nothing our staff couldn't handle. Untilllllllll a group of idiots started launching people onto the crowd. They'd lock hands and by the foot LAUNCH each other up and on top of the crowd. Now, crowd surfing is one thing, this was something else. I knew somebody was about to get hurt. I was actually on the side of the stage when they started doing this so I radio for somebody to go tell em to stop. Before anybody can get over there they launch this kid up in the air and he just lands stomach first on the back of a smaller girls neck/head area. I see it happen. Her head just snaps forward and she just drops. It's PACKED in there too. I kinda wave the band down to stop because she looked to be SERIOUSLY injured and was pretty much right in the middle of the pit. They finally understand and stop the show. We get a perimeter formed around this girl who is out cold and unresponsive. I legit thought she was dead. While we're waiting on paramedics from outside a particularly violent fight breaks out towards the back of the hall. Myself and another guard who was trained MMA guy go to break it up but its fairly obvious quite quickly, these two knucklehead combatants are on something. PCP, ton of coke, I have no idea but we both literally had to choke the two guys unconscious to get them to stop. They were covered in blood with numerous wounds to the face and neck from their fight. I am dragging one of these unconscious yahoo's out of the back door by the leg of his jeans when the paramedics show up. They bend down to start looking at him and I say something along the lines of, \"fuck this guy, he'll wake up in a minute. Who you're here for is the unconscious girl inside with the neck injury.\" I will never forget the look on that one paramedics face. Late, late, late that night around 3am that girls parents showed up to retrieve her car from valet. She apparently was fine but stayed in the hospital for the night. Her parents thanked us. For what, I'm not really even sure.  \n\nStop, Drop, Open up Shop....  \nAnother night the LOX and their whole Ruff Ryder crew were closing a night out for us and during their last song, they invite everybody in the club up on stage with them. It's nothing short of a complete disaster. Stage security was totally overwhelmed and just let it happen. The LOX and company then try to take EVERY PERSON ON STAGE UP THE BACK STAIR WELL TO THEIR DRESSING ROOM on the 3rd floor. Myself and a few other guards go to block the stairwell halfway up and try to send the fans back to the music hall. Some testy words get thrown around and next thing I know we're exchanging blows with the Ruff Ryders in the stairwell until some Sheriff Deputies who happened to already be on the scene show up and put a stop to it all.  \n\nReality Check  \nAnd now for the scariest thing that almost happened. It still freaks me out to think about what could have been. We had just finished up a Turbonegro concert. (Norwegian punk) Most everyone is out of the music hall and milling around the back driveway where the valet is. A blacked-out Yukon SUV pulls up to the entrance and a sheriff deputy gets out and walks right up to me. He starts telling me \"they\" are looking for a specific individual who is believed to be on premise and is a known heroin dealer they've been investigating. Dude is a sheriff, uniform and all but it just seems off to me so I radio for my boss, our operations manager. He shows up and I hand the sheriff off to him to deal with. As I said, something felt off with him and his story so I get on the radio to the rest of the staff saying \"this is what this Sheriff looks like, if he comes inside the venue make sure myself or my boss is with him.\" Little bit of time goes by and I don't see the Sheriff guy but his Yukon is still parked there by the back door. I radio my aforementioned boss asking whatever happened with the Sheriff. Boss said he gave him the same spiel he gave me and boss-man told him to hang tight a moment while he radioed our staff about the \"drug dealer situation.\" Boss radios me that he too thinks this feels weird so he is going to see if any sheriffs were upstairs that might could come vet our \"sheriff\". West Hollywood Sheriffs would hang out on the frontside of HOB on Sunset all the time as it was a pretty busy part of Sunset Blvd and between HOB, the Mondrian Hotel next door, Comedy Store across the street and Saddle Ranch just down the way. Meantime, we lose track of \"Sheriff guy\". I start getting a real bad feeling about this whole thing. This was a few months after the Daryl Dimebag shooting in Ohio so yeah.....Anyway, I finally find the \"Sheriff guy\" in the main music hall talking to a few concert goers. Mind you again, this guy is wearing the full legit Sheriffs uniform for West Hollywood. Boss radios me that a couple of Sheriffs were upstairs on another call and should they come down to check this guy out. I said fuck yes. Something is wrong here. So the Sheriffs come downstairs and approach our \"sheriff.\" I am about 20+ feet away from this so I can't hear what is being said but after a very brief conversation our \"sheriff\" turns around and puts his hands behind his back and the other sheriffs put cuffs on him. He aint no \"sheriff\". After he's cuffed they start pulling an assortment of knives from various pockets off his person. 3 or 4 best of my recollection. They walk him out to a Sheriff car and put him in the back. And this is where we lose cabin pressure. I'm standing right behind our \"sheriffs\" Yukon when the real Sheriffs come over with his keys to search his vehicle. I have a clear view when they pop the back hatch open and right there, in the back is a box of shotgun shells, two shotguns and a hand gun. I seriously almost passed out. We seriously just avoided a hellscape I'd still rather not even think about. \n\nFuckin' Drama  \nNow for a couple of Barneys stories. I'm not gonna claim 100% responsibility for the line but one day I carded Kevin Dillon (Entourage) just to make sure it was him. It was. Next season of Entourage Drama drops some line about him not being old along the lines of \"Hey i just got carded the other week at Barneys Beanery.\" I got a good chuckle out of that whether our interaction was the impetus for that line or not.\n\nJackass II  \nThe Jackass guys used to come into the Bean quite a bit during these days. One night, I'm working, leaned up against the jukebox talking to Johnny Knoxville. In walks Luke Wilson and while Knoxville isn't paying attention, talking to me, Luke walks right up and backhands Knoxville in the nuts and walks right back out. They weren't filming anything. Luke never said a word. And he had JUST gotten to Barneys. He basically walked in, smacked Knoxville in the nuts and left. Hilarious. \n\nTracy Morgan Chronicles  \nNow on to Tracy Morgan. Ugh. That dude was a lot of fun in these days but also a GIGANTIC pain in the ass. Tracy liked his booze and when he was especially hammered he would go into this alter-ego thing. I cant for the life of me remember what he used to call himself when he was hammered but he had a nickname. We kicked him and his boys out one night because he had his shirt off, climbing over other peoples tables singing karaoke. It wasn't karaoke night. He then goes on Jimmy Kimmel later in the week and gave us a shout out for being \"security assholes.\" Thanks Tracy. \n\nNow the absolute best, funniest security story I have also involves Tracy. One night, when we didn't have to kick him out, he and his buddy leave peaceably headed to their next spot or whatever. He even apologized to us about the Kimmel thing. I thought it was funny, I wasn't even mad. Anyway, I am standing by the side door which looks out to the parking lot and I turn to see our valet guy frantically waving for me to come out there. So I walk out to the parking lot to see two pretty good sized rednecks in Tracy and his friends face about to fight for whatever reason. I call my other guard out there and we try to de-escalate the situation. It's a lot of shit talking but nobodies really gonna do anything. In the middle of all this a total crackhead from out of nowhere ends in the mix telling Tracy and the rednecks just to relax, calm down, get a drink, get some pussy...that sort of thing. To which, one of the rednecks stops, looks right at the crackhead and says (and I quote)\" Shuttup you fucking monkey.\" As soon as the -key sound leaves this guys mouth the crackhead slaps the ever living shit out of him and takes off running. These two idiot rednecks chase this crackhead Benny Hill style in circles around the fountain across the street from Barneys. Finally, crackhead takes off up the street and the rednecks give chase. Tracy gets in his car and they start to drive away when here comes the crackhead back, running full speed down the sidewalk. He slows down just enough to grab the bag he had dropped after the initial slap, looks me dead in the eye on the run and yells, \"I GOT EM AGAIN!!!\" Rednecks meander back to the parking lot a couple minutes later and the one that dropped the monkey-bomb has a gigantic red hand print on his face where that crackhead must have slapped the absolute soul out of him. I legit fell down laughing. The other guard is bent over laughing while Tracy is hanging out of the passenger side of his friends car driving away, laughing hysterically. While I haven't read it, apparently Tracy mentions this incident in some book he wrote, maybe his autobiography? I keep forgetting to look into that. Sooner or later I will. \n\nMurder at 8447  \nMy last story of this post is a pretty sad and awful one. This also happened at Barneys. I had accepted a full-time job at a local radio station and had JUST quit working security at Barneys but was there just boozing the night this went down. At some point in the night I notice three guys walk in who are definitely out of place. If you've worked security before, anybody who is super out of place usually will cause or become a problem. These guys were legit, local, cholo types. Super tattooed. Mean mugging. Out of place for Barneys. Later in the night I am at my usual spot, leaned up against the jukebox when these same three guys jump a guy right in front of me. Mind you, I don't even work here anymore but instinct kicked in and I jumped in and separated them while the on-duty security got over there to handle it. No biggie really. Security kicks the three guys out, should be end of story but its not. Flash forward a few minutes and the guy that got jumped starts getting super-angry about it and wont let it go. I say screw it, its not even my job anymore-i-dont-care, I'm going outside for a smoke. I'm out front of Barneys smoking when I look over and see our guy that got jumped before, walk around the corner with a weird look on his face. Before anything else even registers I see a circle of red start growing on his white t-shirt. His eyes go out of focus a bit and he stumbles and falls right in front of me. I immediately know he's been stabbed and when I pull his shirt up, he's got what I pretty much immediately realize as three mortal stab wounds to his chest and abdomen. Shit gets kinda blurry in my recollection here because as you can understand, its pure madness. A couple girls from inside come out and say they are nurses so I hand first-aid over to them about the time paramedics and police show up. I am absolutely covered in his blood at this point. Police get my information and tell me to go to the IHOP that was directly across the street with another office to wait for Homicide to show up so I can give a statement. Yep. Dude died pretty much right after the medics showed up. This was around 1am. I stayed in that IHOP with no shirt on (i had used my own t-shirt to try and stem the blood flow from his wounds), covered in someone else blood until 8:45AM when the Homicide detectives finally showed up to get my statement. Regular cops wouldn't let me leave for whatever reason. I guess they had to make absolute sure I wasn't with the stabby guys. They would later turn themselves in. [Here is a article about the incident and the legal outcome for them](http://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/2-Plead-No-Contest-in-Fatal-Barneys-Beanery-Stabbing.html)\n\nI would find out later that the reason they both got lenient sentences was because the victim followed them to the parking lot looking to continue their altercation and actually decked one of the guys before the other two stabbed him.\n\nEt tu?  \nWait. I forgot the other big one from HOB. I wasn't actually working security at the time but its related. I left House of Blues for a number of reasons. 1) I caught them massaging everyone's hours to make payroll and confronted them about it. About a year plus after I left they got hit with a major class action suit and I got a check in the mail for $400 some odd dollars. Thanks for the Ipod! and 2) at some point a corporate guy came to our venue and thought our security staff looked too \"thuggish and threatening\". So, they got rid of most everybody who was an enforcer/badass. A couple of monster Samoan brothers. Our 6'9 behemoth. And three other guys who were all huge and very good at their job. To replace these gentlemen they decided to hire 18-20 year old kids who had zero experience or training and were honestly too small to do the job. Shit started to get dangerous so I peaced out. Now. I lived RIGHT behind HOB at this time. Like, within 200 feet or so. One night, I'm home playing Xbox with my roomie and we hear a super loud car accident right outside our door. We go out to inspect and there is a car THRU the courtyard wall of our complex. We go out into the street and there is probably 20+ people fighting in the middle of the street. (The accident was a valet driver from the Mondrian Hotel next door swerving to avoid the fight and plowing into parked cars). As we start to take in this tableau of complete fuckery, a guy we hadn't noticed was laying on the sidewalk 10 feet down the hill starts screaming he's been shot. Me and my roomie rush over to him and I pull his shirt up to inspect the wound and he's legit got just a chunk of flesh missing from his stomach. It really looked like somebody took a melonballer and just scooped out part of this stomach. Luckily for him he hadn't been shot, he'd only been stabbed AND he was lucky that he was a bit chubby around the middle. If that kid would've been rail thin, that stab wound might've been very serious. Since he wasn't skinny, it wasn't life-threatening and it had pretty much stopped bleeding by the time the paramedics got there. Sad part though is when the paramedics relieved me I walked back up the street to check on all my former co-workers to find paramedics working on another stabbing victim. His wound was a bit more serious as I saw with my own eyes a butterfly knife sticking directly out of his chest. He blinked out and passed right then and there. Gone. \n\n[Here is the news link to that one, if you're interested or for proof or whatever.](http://articles.latimes.com/2006/aug/04/local/me-blues4)\n\nTl;dr- a number of crazy fucked up things will happen to you working security ANYWHERE but especially on Sunset Blvd in Los Angeles. \n\nOh shit, I almost forgot. One more quick one. Most people that live in LA for any period of time end up having an encounter with Andy Dick. Here is mine. \n\nOf Course Andy Dick  \nSiouxsie and the Creatures are set to play two nights in a row at HOB. At this time, I am security lead for our staff and on night 1 in the afternoon while we are having our security meeting Siouxsie's manager asks for a private word with me. We step aside and he says, \"Only thing you need to worry about is if Andy Dick shows up. If he shows up, radio me immediately on channel 5 and I will handle it.\" It felt personal and despite my own curiosity I didn't ask why. Flash forward hours later and I am out front of HOB on the \"bridge\" (a little wooden walkway that connected the venue to the sidewalk on Sunset) smoking a cigarette and what do you know, here comes Andy Dick. I make the radio call and in less than a minute, before Dick can even get by the doorman, the manager comes barreling out of the venue bee-lining for Andy. Manager walks right up to Andy, grabs him by the scruff of his neck/jacket and starts hauling him down Sunset Blvd. They disappear and about 15 minutes later the manager comes back. As he walks by we make eye contact and I start to ask WTF and before I even get a sound out he says, \"don't even ask. If he shows back up, call the police.\" No idea what that was all about.\n\nIf you've read all of this, thank you. It's been cool writing all this stuff down for the first time. Also, u/slugo17, I said I would let you know when I finally posted this so here you go. Sorry it's so long. ",

        "text": "In a previous life, I was the area manager for security firm, and was the sole patrolman/guard/sales/etc during the day due to our branches size. Part of our job was responding to home detention events. Had a couple of interesting ones you may like...\n\nWe had had the contract for about 4 months at this point, and overall our company and our client were still working out technical bugs in the system. Often this meant offenders had to be put on manual monitoring, which meant visiting the site at a set period to make sure they were still where they were meant to be. This was generally ok provided the night or day didn't get too hectic with alarms or noise complaints. But one night, the network that communicated the status of the offenders went down. We had 15 offenders spread across a 30 mile radius of our base. Along with all of our scheduled work, we had to call in an extra 3 staff as well as myself in addition to the 2 patrol officers already doing it. It lasted 3 nights before everything was back up and running properly. Never had so much respect for guys running on empty and still getting the job done.\n\nSecond was a job for an offender that said he had left the property at 07:30. I went around there, and expected him to be there as we had had issues with the cell signal during the setup. I knock on the door. Half a minute goes by. Knock again. Still nothing. Just about to go around the back, and the door opens - with the offender holding a machete. I quickly take a step back and explain who I am and what I'm there for. He puts the machete down and explains he uses it only to lock the door. I say no worries and I'll be on my way. Needless to say I called it in and got a call later that day to collect the unit from the local police station.\n\nHave come across a couple of bodies too, if you want to hear about them...",

        "text": "Still amazes me how quickly people flip when they have a few beers in em. \n\nThree early-30's lads - one whom I recognised as the younger brother of a bloke I used to tangle with frequently in high school back in the day - in my relatively quiet venue tonight for a few hours. Out on the smoke deck, having a brew, one playing some god awful rap album on repeat about 'hoes' or something from his phone. We had a bit of a natter every now and again when I was checking on my rounds. Same as his brother, by the sound of him. Thinks he's hard. \n\nI'm on post at the door about 20 mins ago when I could here a commotion around the corner at the bar. Walk around, 2 of em are hanging back whilst the third was berating a table of Indian lads from the shop around the corner (they have a few beers here after work cos they know the manager) with the usual bogan tripe: 'Fuck off back to yer own country cunts' type of shit. I could tell straight away the other two didn't want a bar of him, so Greedy's beast mode flipped on. \n\nBellowed out a nice and loud ***'Oi!'*** as I double timed over. Didn't even look my way, but his friends parted; confirming at least I know they won't be a problem. He's shorter than me by about half a foot, stockier though. Fuck it, hard mode it is. \n\nChoke hold from behind and knee in the back of his thigh brings him down to his knees. Don't let him drop, don't let him stand: hold him by the neck. Good blast in the ear - \"Pull your fucking head in or I'll pull it off, are we clear?\" \n\nNothing. Face is going a bit red. Tighten the choke, pull up a bit so his airway is completely cut off now. \n\n\"I said, are we **clear?**\" \n\nFeeble nod. Good. \n\nI allow him to stand. Release, bit of a nudge. He spins on me. Heeeeere we go. \n\n\"Don't roll up on me like that mate!\"\n\nI laugh in his face. \"You grab a random patron and try to start a fight with him purely on the fact he ain't from here and you are upset *I* grabbed you? First, how's GET FUCKED sound and second,' I waved his friends over, \"If you don't want to leave by the *fucking window* I suggest your friends walk you out. Now.\" \n\nThe little fucker struts out with his mates, only to try and start me back up at the door. I open the door and say point blank \"5 steps. Walk out in 5 seconds. 4 seconds. 3 seconds...\" He is dragged out by his mates. Door auto locks. \n\nI go out to the smoke deck to check on the bloke he grabbed. I could hear his mates calming him down. Usual platitudes, \"He's not worth it\" etc etc. I'm cool with that. What I'm *not* cool with is him going to his car for a tire iron, one of those cross ones. As he's coming back, I just point at the camera. \n\n\"Licence plate for your car, and whatever you have done and are going to do.\" \n\nThey left. Came soooo damn close to raging out on the little chucklefuck. Been a while since I've gone Beastmode. ",

        "text": "So, essentially, a CW of mine and I discovered this subreddit recently, and have been lurking for a few weeks now. We've both talked about collaborating and posting here from time to time, so I'm going to lead off and see where it goes. I'll edit and link his username if he ever decides to come around and help me out with these stories. We both work contract security for a hospital in a generally sketchy area, with an undying love for methamphetamine and doing weird shit. Since this is my first post in this subreddit and my first ever post on Reddit at all, I'm going to attempt to write some \"teasers\" of my experiences. If I get enough positive feedback, I'll bug my CW until he gives in and we'll write some killer tales from our weird ass post. Or maybe I'll post them anyways, because writing passes the time while I'm sitting at this desk doing nothing. \n\nSo, here goes:\n\nThe Tale of the Two Guitars; Call comes out over the radio of suspicious white male in the employee parking lot, looking into physicians' car windows, and that he has a duffel bag and a guitar on his back. Three officers respond, contact individual. Turns out just to be a young kid, mom dropped him off to meet dad (employee), he got a little lost. Since he was the only one in the lot with a guitar on his back, and he matched the description, we bid him a good night and sent him in the right direction. Some time later, the dispatch officer called and inquired about the guy with the guitar we encountered earlier, so I filled him in on the situation. He then informed me that there was another man, who was probably in his fifties, with a  guitar on his back waiting in the ER lobby to be seen. We all kind of just stared at the CCTV for a moment and simultaneously thought, \"Eh, to hell with it.\" He'll deny anything we ask him anyway, and he has legit business now (Being seen by a doctor). We go about our night as usual, until we get called back to the ER lobby for a report of a disturbance. It was guitar guy #2. Ending to this story can be done if there's interest in it. \n\n\"Ma'am, stop flapping your breasts at me\": This story is one that happened to my CW that I want to collaborate with, and I witnessed it via CCTV. We would probably each write from our own points of view. The title is the teaser in this one.\n\n\"STOP RAPING ME\": A story from my second day of on-the-job-training. It really opened my eyes to what could be experienced in healthcare security. Basically, a patient with drugs in his system was placed on a doctor's hold and refused to give a urine sample. Side note to anyone who ends up on a doctor's hold- do what the staff fucking asks. Even if you don't agree, seek legal counsel afterwards... don't fight with staff. Doctor's have a lot more power than you think. Well, without ruining the story, we obtained urine from him. Forcibly. \n\nJessie's Girl: The story about how I got an absolutely shit-faced patient to start serenading my sergeant until he said, \"Fuck you, I'm out\" and stormed out of the room to leave me to assist the patient in draining the alcohol from their body. \n\n\"Uhhh, Patrol 1.... This guy's trying to steal our wheelchair\": This may be a story that you really had to be there to enjoy, but I'll do my best to describe it. Essentially, This guy got discharged from the ER and wanted to call 911 to have EMS transport him to a different hospital. We knew EMS would just laugh at him and probably call him a worthless drug seeker (which is exactly what he was doing), so we refused to let him use our phones. He tried to steal our wheelchair. Hilarity ensued.\n\nI have a lot of other stories, as they happen weekly. Like I stated before, this is just a preliminary post to see if my writing and storytelling skills are worth a hot damn. I am interested in hearing any and all constructive criticism, and if you folks would like me to elaborate on any of these stories. \n\nEdit: Here's the link to my first story! \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromsecurity/comments/47ho9g/the_tale_of_two_guitars/\n\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "So, you'll probably think that I'm crazy, and I completely don't blame you. I've questioned my own sanity more than once dealing with this stuff, so you're not alone in looking at me funny. When I started working in hotels, my training officer told me that the building we were working in was one of the most haunted in the city. I didn't believe him, obviously, but it always tickled the back of my mind, late at night, walking the empty hallways alone...\n\n**Through the Wall:** So, I'm patrolling the floors one night. Our hotel is part of a multi-property building that houses two of our hotels and an apartment complex. \n\nThe route we take is dictated by specific buttons we have to hit at opposite ends of the floors, and in the stairwells. This leads us from hotel to hotel to apartments, and then down a floor, apartments to hotel to hotel. \n\nNothing major, standard crash bar fire doors between each property, no big deal, right? \n\nOne night, I'm walking through the hotels, and I come to the fire door. I push it open quietly, as it's 0200 hours and guests are sleeping, and step through. I close the door gently, and turn around, looking down the long hallway.\n\nAbout halfway down, there's a woman standing in the hall, looking my direction. Early 20's, dark red hair cut about chin length, white or pale blue sundress and bare feet. Pretty, in a kind of timeless way, with striking blue eyes.\n\nI do the standard 20-10 rule. Make eye contact and smile at 20 ft, and greet at 10 ft. I'm walking towards her, looking her in the eye, and smiling, and she does the same.\n\n**\"Good morning.\"** I say softly, so as not to disturb those sleeping. \n\nHer smile widens a bit, and she walks forward towards the wall, and then right the hell through it. \n\nI stopped dead in my tracks, and blinked hard. Surely I must be imagining things. Our hotel rooms are set back from the hallway wall, so she surely must have walked into one of the alcoves and into an open door. Surely, I'll hear the door close behind her any second. \n\nI take a few steps forward, to the place where she was standing. I can see the footprints that she left on the freshly vacuumed carpet, and sure enough, there's nothing but wall where she was walking.  \n\nI put my hand on the wall, expecting an electric shock or something, but it was just cold, which wasn't unusual. It was the middle of summer in a Gulf Coast city, and we kept things chilly.\n\nI saw her a few more times in my time there, and she always looked up, smiled, and walked through a wall before I could do much more than realize who I was looking at. \n\n**THAT'S NOT FUNNY!:** So, the building we worked in used to be the home office of an oil company back in the early 1900's, which really isn't saying much, because Houston. You could still see traces of the old office building, in the parking garages, where the hallway tiles were still laid in the concrete, still in excellent shape, due to countless hours of janitors polishing them. \n\nOn the floors of one of the properties, there was an old mail slot that ran from roof to basement. Now, it was sealed up, with the doors closed and the locks engaged, their keys lost to the ages. You could still see through the glass front, though. The slot was maybe 12 inches across, and six inches deep, painted white on the outside and black on the inside. Nothing major. \n\nSo, one night, I'm walking along, doing my rounds. Standard night, no big. I'm coming up on the place where the mail slot is standing out from the wall, and I see something fly past. Like, an envelope dropped from floor to ceiling, on it's way to the basement, fluttering against the glass as it went. \n\nI pause, wondering how in the hell someone had gotten the mail slot open upstairs. I walk on, and glance into the slot, where I see not the back wall six inches away, it's black paint cracked with age, but a deep black void. \n\nI stop, and blink. Surely my eyes are playing tricks on me. I rub my eyes and peer into the darkness. Sure enough, it's like there is a vast empty space beyond the glass. I move closer (against my better judgment), and cup my hands to peer into the space. \n\nAs I press my face up against the glass, I start to make out a shape in the distance. Before I can react, this shape comes hurtling towards me, and I realize what I'm seeing. \n\nIt's a man, dressed in a finely tailored three piece gray suit, red striped tie flapping, pale and gaunt, hanging by the neck, swinging towards me at the end of his noose like a pendulum. He slams up against the glass with an inhuman shriek, and I fall backwards, tripping over my own feet in an attempt to back away (I don't laugh at people in horror movies who do that anymore). \n\nI can't tear my eyes away from the figure beyond the glass, and he laughs, pointing at me, as he swings back into the darkness. Apparently my terror amuses him, as he disappears back from whence he came. \n\nI stand up, trembling, hand on my radio mic, ready to scream for help (which wouldn't come, since I was the only one on duty), and look back into the glass.\n\nIt's a mail slot. Nothing out of the ordinary. No marks on the glass where he hit, nothing. Not even the residue of my breath. \n\nI get moving, and skip that floor for a few nights. Never saw him again. \n\n**The Puppy Ghost:** So, this one is a little hard to explain, but I'll do my best. \n\nIn the other property of that hotel, an extended stay kind place, we had three more floors than the main hotel. They were all much smaller, with only a few rooms and roof access. \n\nThis happened multiple times, and I can't describe it as anything more than a feeling, with one exception. \n\nI'm doing my patrols, coming off of two weeks straight without a day off (covering my partner's vacation). I'm absolutely exhausted, damn near sleeping on my feet (thanks for that, US Army). I come in off of the roof, and lean against a wall, closing my eyes for a few seconds. \n\nWhen I go to walk forward, I trip over something, and hit the floor. No damage done except to my pride, I get up and try to move on, but I find that my boots are tied together in a complicated weaving knot. \n\nNow, I wear military style boots, with the laces tightened, crossed, and wrapped around my calves, and then double knotted in front, laces tucked into the boots. It's not like they're loose to be grabbed or anything. I sit there, staring uncomprehendingly at my feet, and I get this feeling like there's somebody with me. \n\nIt's not a bad feeling. More like an exuberant puppy, excited to play. Like it just learned to fetch and brought me back the stick for the first time. \n\nI feel this feeling probably once every few weeks on this top floor, like the presence or whatever it is has been waiting on me to return, and is excited to see me again.\n\n**The Cage:** So, once I moved to hospital security, the property we were on had the old main hospital (built in the 40's), the new main tower (built 2013ish), a cardio hospital (built mid 2000's), an office tower, a few specialty buildings, and a single story office building. \n\nThis single story building was in the shape of a U, with offices on the interior and exterior walls of the hallway. We didn't do anything inside the offices (a lot of which were just used for storage), but locked and unlocked the building morning and night. \n\nOne night a few months before the building's destruction (to make room for a new office tower), I'm walking along through the dark hallways, and I see some movement in one of the offices. The blinds that cover the glass front are moving, like there's someone inside. I don't have keys to any of the interior offices, so I slow down and put a hand on my radio, just in case somebody's broken in and I need to call for PD backup. I creep up, and hear a muttering voice from inside. I call for our PD Officer to come meet me, and we investigate, but can't find anything amiss, so it goes in the daily log, and when morning comes, the owner of the office reports nothing wrong. \n\nOkay, cool. \n\nFast forward a few months, and the building is getting emptied to be torn down. My partner and I are wandering in and out of the now unlocked offices, supervising people taking whatever junk they wanted that we were just gonna throw out. I find that this office has something hidden behind a bookshelf. I call my partner over, and we move the bookshelf out of the way. Behind it is a latch to a hidden room. It's separated into two halves, one of which is a floor to ceiling steel cage that looks to be welded into place, and is bolted to the cement floor. Inside the cage is a metal cot with a dingy dust covered mattress, and above it is a red lightbulb in one of those old style metal and glass cages. An ancient padlock sits on the door, broken ages ago by what seems to be bolt cutters. Outside the cage is a single folding chair, a small table, and a brand new notepad with the words \"It's over.\" scrawled across it in blue ink.\n\nNow, it's not unreasonable to assume that the notepad was placed there in the last few days by some chuckle head who was trying to be creepy, but we check the records of previous tenants, and nobody has any idea of WHY IN THE HELL THERE'S A CAGE IN A HIDDEN ROOM!!!\n\n**The Laughing Man:** So, there's this little old guy in the Emergency Department. He speaks no English, only Italian. We don't have a translator available who speaks Italian, but smartphones are a beautiful thing, and Google Translate does the trick. He's afraid I'm going to arrest him for whatever, and I assure him that I'm not arresting anybody. I'm just security, I'm there for his safety, since he was getting fussy with the nurses, and that as long as he remains calm, we're good to go.\n\nIn the wee hours of the morning he gets admitted and moved upstairs. I'm doing rounds, and I happen to pass by the room that he is occupying (unbeknownst to me). From the darkness of the room I hear this creepy little laugh. Like, clearly an old man's laugh, but almost forced. \n\n*\"Heh...heh heh....heh. Hah...Hah...HAHA...\"*\n\nIt keeps getting louder and louder as I peer into the dark room to check on the patient. I find him there, hair wild, gown in disarray, his eyes like a cat's in the darkness, almost glowing with reflected light, laughing to himself like some sort of mad king as he stands there on his bed, alone in the darkness. \n\nI grab a few nurses, and we talk him back into bed. He goes to sleep, and we have no further issues. The image of him standing there in the dark, laughing to himself, won't ever go away.",

        "text": "Hi, Guys. I've seen some.. Well, weird shit in my time. Most of my friends and co workers have frankly remarked that I'm an out and out magnet for the weird shit. Couple that with the fact that I've mostly worked night shift for distribution centers/trucking yards/production plants and, well, I guess I sorta am, yeah?\n\nAnyways, onto this particular story because I think I should tell it.\n\nI'd like to preface this with the fact that I am not, in any way, shape, or form discriminatory folks with an alternative life style. I'm from the Southeastern United States, I'm a bit \"different,\" but I do my damndest to accommodate folks the very best that I can, but I'm not the most politically correct fellow out there. I apologize for it, and I try to make do, but it is what it is.\n\nWith that said, onto the story!\n\nSo, I was working a 3-11 shift at a production plant that... Well, they processed hams and meaty goods, what have you. Now, most of the employees are lower income/ex cons making mostly minimum wage. Most ain't exactly the most educated, or accepting, but hey, who is these days? Anyways, one of these fellows that come up to get me to check their ID is named Ted. Now, Ted was special.\n\nBy special, I mean Ted was around 6'5\", 250 pounds, black as midnight and wearing a sundress and a blonde wig. Yeah, I said that. Yes, it's true. No, I wasn't drinking on that particular shift, fuck you. See, that's the thing, we conversed a bit. Ted *told* me to call him Ted. Ted *told* me that he was a man. If Ted wanted me to call him another name, I would have. If Ted told me to call him Princess Ana-fucking-stasia Roma-fucking-nova, I'd have called him Princess Ana-fucking-stasia Roma-fucking-nova; being polite costs nothing.\n\nAnyways, Ted was a nice enough fella, I liked him. His dress didn' technically violate dress code, but whatever. Guess the guy liked to be pretty. Of course, while I might be wholly tolerant, some of those plant workers weren't. While you can imagine he got taunted and ridiculed, you can probably also imagine that he got tired of the shit. \n\nHe did. Oh boy, he got fucking tired of that shit quick enough.\n\nNow, I get a call on my radio. Some asshole at the office is telling me that Ted's got a knife and that he's trying to kill one of said assholes. Now, first off, I'm immediately thinking \"why the fuck are you callin' ME about it!?\" Second off? \"Fuck, I'm Security, that's why they're calling me!\" So, naturally, I call the cops and head up there because uh, well, there's a large man in a dress with a knife trying to kill someone/kick their ass. There's no way in fucking hell that I can't NOT look at it!\n\nWell, I get up there, and shit. Ted really is going after this poor dumb bastard. See, I like Ted well enough, he's a good enough guy, and honestly if some Barney Fife deputy sheriff shows up? Ted's gonna be dead. Black, dress wearing, knife wielding man? That's a three-fer for a country cop! I try to talk Ted down, but he's not having it. Fuck it. Anyways, I get it in my head that I can handle this and I do one of the dumbest fucking things I've ever done as a security guard.\n\nI tackle Ted.\n\nTed's a large man, but I'm also a large man and I wasn't half bad as a Left Tackle in my shitty high school football days. Well, the knife miraculously goes flying, and I take Ted down but... You see, I now have another problem I did not yet account for.\n\nI'm on the ground, with a large man, who's wearing a dress.\n\nThis no-drawers-wearing, horse-dicked, mother fucker's dress goes up to his waist. I feel his cock hit my leg and it weighs about as much as a sledge hammer. I tell you, man. I'm bisexual, I'm not homophobic, but there's just something ... I don't know. I got the fucking heebie-jeebies from his pet iguana being on my goddamn leg while I'm trying to subdue him. It's comically horrific now, but fuck! It was horrifying back then! Anyways, I manage to subdue Ted. [I ain't supposed to use a Rear Naked Chokehold but desperate times. I was trying not to die/trying to be in a situation where his cock wasn't on my leg.]\n\nAnyways, yes. I've seen some crazy shit.",

        "text": "Yall seemed to enjoy my stories, so here's a few more. \n\n**As a Jaybird:** So, at the smaller hotel I used to work at, we only had bellmen on day shift, so if luggage or heavy items needed to go up later in the day, it fell to me. One of the first things I did when arriving for duty at 2100 hours was to take guests' dry cleaning up to their rooms. It was usually only a few stops, but I found out quickly that I needed to do one of the guests first so I'd have an excuse to walk away. \n\nThere's this really nice guest. Top level reward member, in house three to four days a week, and had her dry cleaning done on the first or second day of her stay. Very nice lady, from somewhere in one of the former Soviet States, maybe. She spoke beautifully accented English, and was always very respectful to all of our staff. She was drop dead gorgeous, without that  condescending \"I'm prettier than you\" attitude. These are the guests that we bend over backwards for, not because of the reward status, but because we absolutely adore them.\n\nMy first time meeting her, I'd taken up her dry cleaning, had dropped it off without incident, and she'd thanked me profusely. I walked away thinking *\"Now why can't all guests be like that?\"*.\n\nThe next week, I go up, and am looking forward to dealing with her, so I save her for last. I've got a couple of items for her, and had ditched the bell cart on my way down from the top floors, and am standing there with her dry cleaning in my hands. \n\nI knock. **\"Loss Prevention. I have your dry cleaning, ma'am.\"**\n\n*\"Just a second...\"* the reply comes, and I am vaguely aware of the shower in the room being turned off. \n\nAbout thirty seconds goes by, and I hear her footsteps just inside the door. The flip lock clicks, as does the deadbolt, and the handle turns. \n\nThe door swings open, revealing her standing there dripping wet, without any clothes on. I'm not complaining, mind you, because the view was worth viewing, but my \"I'm about to get fired\" instincts kick in, and I immediately drop my eyes to the floor. \n\n**\"Here's your dry cleaning, ma'am.\"**\n\nShe backs up, opening enough space for me to enter the room. \n\n*\"Please come in. You can just put it on the bed. I'll get your tip.\"*\n\nI freeze for a half a second, every warning bell in my head screaming at me to run, that they're watching, that this is a trap...due to privacy laws, we don't have cameras on guest rooms, since for the time they are staying, it's their home, and as such they have a reasonable expectation of privacy, so I know nobody can see me, but I'm terrified she's part of a secret shopper type sting. With that said, she's a top level reward member, and thus essentially a god...or goddess, as the case may be (and she was indeed that).\n\nSo....I stepped inside. \n\n*\"Give me one moment. I've just got to find my bag.\"* she says, busying herself around the room.\n\n**\"Oh, that's not really necessary, ma'am. I do appreciate the thought, but this is all just part of the service.\"** I say in my most customer service-y voice, still staring at the floor.\n\nShe takes the dry cleaning from me, and I can feel her eyes boring into the top of my head, trying to make me look up. \n\n*\"Well, thank you very much...\"* she says, glancing at my nameplate. *\"ISometimesCrit. I will tell your management about you.\"*\n\nShe stuck her hand out to shake mine. I took her hand out of instinct (dear sweet bouncing baby Buddha, her hand was soft) and stammered a reply and beat it out of the room.\n\nI started dropping her stuff off first, so I'd have an excuse not to stay. Not that I didn't want to stay. The offer was enticing, to say the least, but I knew that I'm just smart enough to get away with that kind of thing, and that's not what I wanted my department to be known for. \n\n**Anatomic Names:** That smaller hotel, which was in the middle of downtown, was right at the end of the bar crawl on Main Street, so we had our fair share of drunk guests. Nine times out of ten, they're a non issue. They stumble up to their room and pass out. Cool, no worries. \n\nSo, one night, me and the front desk guy, named FDG, were chilling out in the lobby. We're buds, and talk on anything that crosses our minds, wasting the minutes away until my next set of rounds. We have a Top Level Rewards guest come down and inform us that she's not been given her Top Level gift. \n\nWe both apologize, and FDG offers her anything she'd like from the little snack shop we have right off of the front desk. She grabs some horribly overpriced instant noodles, and asks for help cooking them. I go around the desk, get her noodles running, and the three of us chit-chat for a few minutes while they cook. \n\nThe microwave dings, I hand her the noodles, and she stares hard at me, while speaking to FDG. \n\n*\"Just go ahead and charge this to my room. Room This Number. The name is Jane. Jane Zdick.\"*\n\nNow, I should clarify, this wasn't her real name. Not even anything close, but her last name made it sound like the name was \"FirstName's Bodypart\". \n\nFDG just kind of shrugs, since it was her free rewards gift, and we say goodnight. So, she trundles back upstairs, cheeks and nose flushed as red as her hair with the alcohol, and me and FDG just kind of shrug it off. A few days later, the Lead Valet, LV, and I have rented a suite (employee rates FTW) for the night, and are planning on hitting up the bar crawl. We park at the hotel, go inside to get changed/spruced up, and run into her in the hallway. \n\n*\"Oh hey! It's me, Jane Zdick!\"*\n\n**\"Right, right, how are you?\"** I ask, hating the fact that I'm recognizable out of uniform. \n\n*\"Good, good. What are you up to?\"*\n\nLV speaks up, helpfully...\n\n\"Oh, we're gonna hit the bars on Main Street.\"\n\nHer face lights up. \n\n\"*I would love to crash that.\"* she says, doing this weird little girl voice out of nowhere. \n\nLV seems to realize his mistake, and his eyes go wide. \n\n\"Oh, yeah...yeah, that sounds....great.\"\n\n**\"We're gonna go get changed and done up, so if you wanna meet us down in the lobby in say....an hour and a half?\"** I said, stepping in. \n\nShe squeaks with delight, and scampers (literally scampers) off to her room.\n\nLV and I hit our room, change as fast as possible, and GTFO of the hotel. Never saw her again. \n\n**Racist AF:** So, FDG and I became really good friends, to the point that no topic was off limits. We talked about politics, religion, sex, and racism. Now, this last one is important, because he was black and I was white. I mean, we are both still black and white, but.....anyway. I digress. Dude was smart. I'm a fairly intelligent guy, but this kid makes me look like an idiot child. There was nothing that didn't come as easily to him as breathing came to us. He was working in hotels because he was in school and the schedule was convenient.  \n\nSo, one night we're watching the news on the Lobby TV, and some racist has done something racist, and we start in on the topic of how racism is stupid, and every race is worthless in the eyes of the Army (we were both vets), and started talking about racial slurs and their origins. \n\nSo, obviously we eventually circle around to that word that white folks in the South aren't supposed to say ever for any reason ever. \n\nWe talk about it, how it got it's origins from the Niger region in Africa, and oh now let's talk about other words with interesting etymologies. Like I said, dude was smart. \n\nSo, after a bit, this late arrival (like 0200 hours, late arrival) comes in. Nice lady, tired, but sweet. We greet her, start getting her checked in, and she and I are making small talk while FDG does the computer stuff. \n\n**\"How was your trip in?\"**\n\n*\"I've had worse. Flight was delayed, and then the traffic getting here was a nightmare.\"*\n\nI make a dismissive sound like Will Smith as the Fresh Prince. \n\n**\"Psh. Figures.\"**\n\n*\"Yeah, figures.\"*\n\n**\"Well, have a good night.\"**\n\nI turn back to FDG as he's handing her the key cards to her room, and he's just got this shocked look on his face. She goes upstairs, and FDG grabs me by the arm. \n\n\"What the hell did you just say to her?\"\n\nI'm confused. \n\n**\".....have a good night?\"**\n\n\"The thing before that!\"\n\nI'm racking my brain trying to figure out what the hell's got him so riled. I have no idea what's going on.\n\n**\"We were talking about traffic, and I said \"Psh, figures.\".\"**\n\nFDG relaxes, and his smile (which was dazzling, BTDubs) returns. \n\n\"Good god, man. I thought yall were talking about traffic and you said 'Psh, n*ggers.' and she went, 'Yeah...n*ggers.'. You confused the crap outta me.\"\n\nIt took me a minute to formulate a reply.\n\n**\"Well....welcome to my world, asshole.\"**\n\nWe finish our shift, and all's right with the world.",

        "text": "It was suggested I post this here too and, since I'm a subscriber, I see no reason not to...\n\nA little background; I work in corporate security. I work long hours and my shifts end at midnight so, if I unexpectedly run out of something at home, I am sometimes forced to stop over at the 24-hour Walmart after work. Of course I'm going to be wearing my uniform, which is actually a blazer, slacks, white shirt, and a tie, with my company name and \"SECURITY\" modestly embroidered on the breast pocket of the blazer, along with my name tag. Very professional-looking. I do *not* resemble a \"mall cop\" or the typical security you'd see in a big box store. Now, people do sometimes mistake me for an employee at various places when I shop in uniform, but I've gotten nothing more than a \"where's the bathroom\" or \"could you help me reach something\" until this situation...\n\nSo, one day I realize I am almost out of dog food. There won't be enough to feed them in the morning, so off to WM I go after work. I walk in at about 12:45 am on a weekday. The place is near deserted. As I make my way back to the pet food I notice a pack of obnoxious, possibly drunk teens goofing around in the toy section. Typical yelling, throwing around Nerf footballs, running up and down the aisles, etc. Annoying, but nothing destructive or dangerous going on, so I ignore them and go about my shopping.\n\nI've selected my giant bag of dog food, placed it in my cart, and I'm browsing the treats and toys when I feel a firm tap on my shoulder. I turn around to see a very old, very pissed off man standing there scowling at me.\n\n(ME=me, OM=old man)\n\nME: Yes?\n\nOM: Are you going to do something?\n\nME: About what exactly?\n\nOM: You think it's ok to let a bunch of stupid kids treat this place like a playground?\n\nME: Oh, I don't work here. Sorry, can't help with that.\n\nOM: What do you *mean* you don't work here? You're wearing a suit and the jacket says you're security.\n\nME: Since when do WalMart employees wear suits? I'm a customer and I'm *shopping*, see? (point to my cart)\n\nOM: Doesn't matter. You're security. You're supposed to be trained to deal with situations like this. It's your professional *duty* to do something about those kids before they hurt someone.\n\nME: *I. DON'T. WORK. HERE.* I'm a security officer, not a cop! I am under no obligation to help this store with their security issues, and could actually get into legal trouble if I tried and anything went wrong. This store employs their own security. If you find kids tossing a rubber ball around so terrifying, go up front and complain to an *employee*, not me.\n\nOM: (squints at my name tag and company name on my blazer) I'm going to get in touch with \"Security Company\" and let them know all about this, Gorilla1969. You should be **FIRED**, and I hope you are after this!\n\nME: That's wonderful. Knock yourself out, sir.\n\nOM: And you're rude too!\n\nME: I'm off the clock and off-site, this is my own personal time, so enjoy the real me old man.\n\nSo, to recap; security officers apparently double as stealth Boy/Girl Scouts or ninjas or something, and must be prepared to Do Their Duty at all times, in all situations, on any property, and for no pay.",
