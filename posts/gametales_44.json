        "text": "We rejoin our heroes, currently in Sigil, in their shop, standing over a feverish and delusional druid and wondering what's going on.   \n[Previous Story](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2iujxk/saving_a_soul_from_hades_part_five_dd_35e_e6/)  \n  \nThe Party is:  \n**Fortinbras** Dragonborn, Favoured Soul 6, &amp; his pet wyrmling silver dragon Nero.  \n**Kurask** Silverbrow Human, Paladin 6, &amp; his special mount: A Drakkensteed with no name (that I'm aware of).  \n**Roku** Mineral Warrior Human, Crusader 4 / Barbarian 2  \n**Stanley** Human Warlock 6    \n**Azrael** Human Sorcerer 6 &amp; his familiar, a Blinkdog.  \n**Baha Abdur** Human Duskblade 6  \n**Norril** Human Cloistered Cleric 6 of Olidammara, and a member of the thieves' guild.  \n  \n  \n**Session 12**  \n  \nSo Fortinbras takes the doctor aside and discovers that Dalan was trying to help a Nymph friend of his out in the Beastlands when he was bitten by something poisonous. He managed to make it to the portal and collapsed in Sigil, the doctor cannot give the right antivenom without knowing which venom he's dealing with. The party agree to venture forth to the beastlands and question the Nymph as to the nature of the Druid's poisoning.  \nThe party head to the beastlands and well, do no research at all so it comes as a surprise when the party step into the beastlands that the Azrael's blinkdog immediately goes native and starts chasing wildlife. As they're telepathically linked he tried to reason with it, but it would just say things like \"fun, fun, fun, chase, chase, chase, play, play, play... SQUIRREL!\" in his head.  \nAlso Stanley's fly spell didn't work... so he fell flat on his face, being paralysed from the waist down as a result of a botched anti-petrification potion ([Session 5](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2djjc1/beholders_basilisk_blood_and_bumbling_heroes_dd/)). Using some rope they lashed the warlock onto Roku, giving Roku a Warlock Backpack/Eldritch Blast turret, which he didn't mind.  \nThey then journeyed to the Nymph's realm, noting the polluted river on their way. The Nymph said the Modron March ([Session 2, Remember that?](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2csbp6/my_dd_35e_e6_planescape_game_xpost_rdnd/)) had marched through her river and she didn't know why, they normally march over it and don't disturb it for too long, but they'd been marching up it for some reason. She was ditsy and distracted, looking really ugly for a Nymph, with oil in her hair and blemishes on her skin. She did not remember Dalan and couldn't help the party with regards to his poisoning.    \nThe Party went north, caught up with the march (they trudge slow through the mud and had almost come to a stop) and eventually found a Modron able to speak to them, it explained a diversion was caused by the [Wemics](http://forgottenrealms.wikia.com/wiki/Wemic), whom they could not trample due to old accords.  \nThe party decided to approach the Wemics and negotiate with them. The wemics only diverted the Modrons due to a pact with the winged elves.  \nThe party approach the winged elves, who asked the wemics to divert the Modrons because they were already diverted and were going to hit their great tree city. The Prince suggests they speak to Breath of Life, a semi-divine air elemental that blew them off course.  \nThey visit Breath of Life, who is busy raining thunder and lightning down on some Slaad interlopers. When they eventually get his attention he tells them he only blew the modrons off course as a favour to his friend, the Nymph.  \n[My Party's Faces When](http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/112/480/OpoQQ.jpg?1302279568)  \n  \nSo Breath of Life will only help them if they return to the Nymph, get her blessing, they do so, get a lock of her hair, actually a bit of scalp too... the pollution is making the ordinarily beautiful nymph ugly, diseased and generally unpleasant.  \n  \nOnce they have done this Breath of Life helps get the Modrons back on course and they leave the Nymph's river, a few hours pass and the Nymph is already looking more beautiful and tells the adventurer's she will make a full recovery, she asks what she can do to thank them and they tell her about Dalan. She fills a vial with water from her mouth and hands it to Kurask, telling him it will cure Dalan. She also notices Stanley's staff, Treebrother, which makes him a friend to Dryads, noticing his affliction she kisses him, and I describe the sensation returning to his legs, he can walk again... he stumbles like a newborn but he's pretty pleased with the outcome, and uses the staff to balance.  \nThe party return to Sigil, heal Dalan and he thanks them for helping himself and the Nymph. He promptly passes out and the party checks in with Norril's Thieves that run the accountancy whilst they're away. (leadership).  \nThey tell the party that one of the outstanding debts has been paid after they sent out debt recovery letters, which is an easily couple hundred gold. There the session ends.  \n  \n**Session 13**  \nThe party decide to get their affairs in order and really gear up for going to Hades. They get a refund for the cheap wand of \"Rose Tricke\" that was supposed to be \"Rope Trick\", from \"Teh Majicke Shoppe\".  \nThey then hunted down a Paladin called Amalthalda, a Half orc of Pelor, and sold her the Blessed Mace they found, made from a Golden Crystal called Frystalline which is good aligned for overcoing DR, that could be rearranged to deal slashing, piercing or bludgeoning damage as a swift action (tesselating) and was +1. She traded it to them for 6,000gp worth of Darksteel she got from the 9 hells of Baator.  \nThe party also collected a debt from a halfling that owed the accountancy firm a little money and visited an orphanage that owed them two hundred gold. They wrote off the second debt and Fortinbras actually donated money to them. Marcus \"Red\" Redding, the Orphanage owner thanked them, later he sent them a thank you card from the children and a note telling them \"Tell the boat man to take you north of the wall\" as a token of advice from his \"more adventurous days\"  \n  \nWe left it there, it was a short session of admin basically, a few too many players were missing for much else. Plus it got everything set up nicely for next session.\n  \n  \nBaha Adbur by the way has been absent since around the time the party killed all those Khaasta. His player went to America. He had a bonus session when he got back to catch up, but now the party is reunited.  \n  \n[Bonus session here](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2j994f/game_tale_saving_a_soul_from_hades_bonus_session/)  \n  \n",

        "text": "One of the longest running campaigns our group ran was with an evil party. \n\nOver the course of the campaign we took turns DMing so everyone got a chance to play, and it probably kept going strong through the more casual attitude and fresh approach each DM brought to the table.\n\nThis is the story that stuck in my mind of when my character was at his most badass.\n\nOur oddly cohesive party:\n\nKnight: a mage-slaying, heavy armored, in-your-face, in-your-base, nightmare-riding, glaive-waving drow elf who gained a myriad of resistances after she had her heart removed in a ritual performed by....\n\nNecromancer: a star elf that could maim, energy drain then apply a zombie template to your withered corpse before it hit the ground, her army of undead minions matched only by the living minions of...\n\nBeguiler: a tiefling that blended illusion and enchantment to make her bullshit flow like gospel and turn each and every random NPC into an expendable butler; a refined and subtle maniac and the antithesis of....\n\nDruid: a weak, unhealthy, uncoordinated dwarf who, by virtue of the Natural Spell feat, had no reason NOT to be a bear at any given time, mauling enemies, defecating everywhere and providing plenty of distraction to serve...\n\nRogue: a goblin with a pair of daggers who's core concept was \"sneak attack\" and was effectively what you would get if an Invisible Stalker had a child with an empowered Disintegrate spell and the ungodly progeny found an open cutlery drawer.\n\nThen there was my character, Warlock, a human man who had been granted the power of shadowy fey creatures to turn inky darkness into weaponry to destroy his enemies. And innocent bystanders. And lush scenery. \n\nI can't remember why we were breaking into this vault. Warlock was more concerned with inflicting pain and destroying foes than frivolous things like 'ambition' and 'plot'. But, a vault needed to be raided and we had fought our way through the petty guardsmen and bankers to get there.\n\nDruid was eyeing off the tastier looking NPC's that Beguiler had taken control of as we rode a slow, stone elevator down to the level of the vault. Knight stretching in preparation for more fighting, Warlock was impatiently humming and Rogue was nowhere to be seen, indubitably exploiting cover rules or something to hide from everything ever until he was ready to stab it. Necromancer wasn't there because the player was running this section.\n\nElevator reaches the lower level and we step into a small square chamber. Opposite end of the chamber is an arch opening into a larger space; at the end of this area was the vault door. \n\nBetween us and the door were four Warforged. A Warforged is a bit like a golem with slightly more personality. They were standing at attention, watching us disembark the lift. From the outset they were either guards or strictly ornamental but, fortunately, Evil parties are the ones who declare 'roll initiative' and worrying about the motives of the people we meet was secondary to judging whether we could kill them and take their stuff.\n\nI got to go first. Warlock had high physical abilities and, unlike a wizard or a sorceror, had more hit points and could wear armor; as such, he was geared towards invocations that let him shine in melee. That said, he usually opened with a ranged attack, his eldritch blast. The source material is non-specific as to what eldritch blast looks like; for Warlock, inky blackness dripped from his outstretched hand to the floor at his feet. It then scurried like a snakeweasel (kinda like an owlbear) while shrieking before leaping at the target's face. \n\nNicely horrifying when it works.\n\nIt didn't work. This blob of shrieking, snaking darkness got as far as the archway then vanished. \n\nWarlock scowled and warily advanced towards the arch, ready to go through and cut the Warforged apart with melee invocations (looks like the blast, but a melee weapon. Still shrieks). \n\nDruid goes next. To reiterate, he is currently a bear and has been since we've known him. Taking on animal form is a magical power druids have; the key word here being 'magical'. He got to the arch and his outstretched paw withered to his pathetic humanoid hand. Recoiling as if he had been burned (because his powergamer player knew his shitty physical stats outside bear form wouldn't hold up to against a strong breeze) he retreated back to the elevator like a chastised puppy.\n\nThe group figured out quick smart that the area beyond the arch was an antimagic field and that anyone who's job description included 'using magic to ruin everyone's day' was going to be fairly redundant for the encounter.\n\nChuckling at our feeble non-glaive battle tactics, Knight waded into combat with the four warforged that, at this stage, were still just watching us. She challenged the one she figured was the strongest and gets into a hearty duel with all four of them. If you don't think 4v1 counts as a duel you haven't seen a high level knight. Rogue decided to join her because, with the absence of magic, it was a good chance to get some kills in and if everything went bad he knew he could run faster and hide better than  Knight. So they go off to have a jolly murderous time while Druid and Beguiler cower by the elevator, ready to bail on their companions if the encounter turned against them.\n\nBut not Warlock. \n\nMagic may not have been functioning, but Kill Everything was not a magical compulsion.\n\nWarlock could hold his own in a direct fight about as well as Rogue and his ability to reduce damage was, by game mechanics, supernatural, and not subject to antimagic, penetrated only by cold iron which only well-prepared heroes tended to carry. So while he couldn't fly, spew shadowy ink or drop clouds of darkness he was determined not to be useless. Not when there were new and interesting enemies to kill.\n\nMore importantly, I had recently read the grapple rules and even almost understood them.\n\nAs Knight clashed with three Warforged guards and the fourth realised Rogue shanking his metal kidneys was probably a priority target, Warlock strode into the antimagic field and tackled the nearest one. \n\nWarlock successfully got hold of the metallic minion of fiscal security. The DM raised an eyebrow at my tactics, unusual for a 'caster', but didn't hesitate to go along with it, even deciding that the Warforged would have probably spikes all over them (because of course they did). I didn't argue because a) if I was a metal soldier I'd want to be spiky and b) the spikes weren't made of the specific metal needed to hurt Warlock. Despite the flailing, Warlock held on.\n\nKnight proceeded to smack down on a different Warforged and Rogue got into position to stab that one, making it clear that Warlock was on his own with this gambit and if he died, it would be 'hilarious'. Druid and Beguiler kept cowering like the non-Warlock casters they were.\n\nThen it was my turn. I succeeded on the grapple check.\n\n'Okay,' said our DM, 'you do damage like an unarmed strike. What is that, 1d3+3?'\n\n'Oh, no.' I reply, handing him the PHB open to the relevant page. 'Grapple can do many things. I move this way,' moving Warlock back past the arch, 'and the Warforged is coming with me.'\n\nLaughing maniacally, Warlock dragged the Warforged guard back into the magic zone and dropped him in front of Druid and Beguiler. It took no time whatsoever for Durid to shift from 'cowering bear' to 'mauling bear' mode. Beguiler, expecting Warlock to use his darkness powers on the stricken Warforged, watched him wander back out through the arch.\n\n\"Where are you going?\" she asked.\n\nWarlock turned. 'I'm going to go get another one.\"\n\nAnd that is why Warlocks are better than Wizards.\n \n",

        "text": "We rejoin our heroes, currently drunk from honey mead and treewine in the dryad's realm within a great branch of Yggdrasil.  \n[Previous Story](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2gkc3k/keeping_calm_and_killing_khaasta_dd_35e_e6/)  \n  \nThe Party is:  \n**Fortinbras** Dragonborn, Favoured Soul 6, &amp; his pet wyrmling silver dragon Nero.  \n**Kurask** Silverbrow Human, Paladin 6, &amp; his special mount: A Drakkensteed with no name (that I'm aware of).  \n**Roku** Mineral Warrior Human, Crusader 4 / Barbarian 2  \n**Stanley** Human Warlock 6    \n**Azrael** Human Sorcerer 6 &amp; his familiar, a Blinkdog.  \n**Baha Abdur** Human Duskblade 6  \n**Norril** Human Cloistered Cleric 6 of Olidammara, and a member of the thieves' guild.  \n  \n  \n**Session 10**  \nThe party reach the tree-burg of Crux, a town nestled between two branches of Yggdrasil, the town is has about 800 residents. The closest thing to a church it has is the carpenter's guild that worships the great world ash, Yggdrasil, receiving it's gifts and forming them into tools, homes and the like. The party arrive in town and make their way to the market square, on the way people of the town are whispering and pointing, words like \"heroes\", \"freed the slaves\", \"Dragon...\" are banded around in awe. Upon reaching the town square's market the players are approached by a tall, athletic, handsome blonde man that walks with an abundance of confidence and others bow and nod to in respect. He is apparently unarmed and dressed in fine noble garb. Stanley's Eldritch sight picks up that he is actually armed with an invisible greatsword.  \nHe introduces himself as Veridis Mov, and asks the heroes if they are indeed the ones who freed the slaves and sent them to Crux. The heroes confirm this and ask him if he's the mayor. He declines and tells them he is simply a humble citizen that does what he can. He directs the heroes to an almshouse where the slaves were offered sanctuary for a time, and he is off on his way.  \nThe heroes make their way to the almshouse and find a lot of grateful ex-slaves who cheer and applaud them. They discuss with the heroes their intention to return to their homes, a few wish to remain in Crux, the rest plan to return to Sigil and then make their way home from the city of doors. They discovered a route from Crux to Sigil, it is used by the traders of Crux and they plan to leave tomorrow, the heroes volunteer to accompany them for safety and they're heading back to Sigil anyway.  \nAs they discuss travel arrangements shouts and screams can be heard from outside. The party head out to investigate and it's immediately obvious one of the largest buildings in Crux is on fire, a deadly threat in a completely wooden town. The party scramble to the scene, the Carpenter's Guild Hall is ablaze, people are already bringing water in buckets and there are healers with people laid out on the floor, covered in soot and mild burns. Kurask starts giving orders, organizing some bucket lines. Fortinbras and Roku overhear from the wounded that a couple people are still inside, they wet rags, place them over their mouths and rush into the building. Passing fortitude saves against the smoke inhalation they manage to find one of the main workrooms with one of the head carpenter's, a woman who may as well be the head priestess in town, spilling oil and reaching for a lit torch. Roku tackles her to the ground whilst Fortinbras picks up two unconscious men, passed out from smoke inhalation and they start to head out. The priestess breaks free for a moment and tries to fling oil at Roku, he avoids it, grabs her again and drags her outside where she passes out. As they get outside I describe movement in one of the third floor windows, Kurask notices a young boy and summons his Drakkensteed special mount, flying past the window he yanks the boy onto the mount and flies him to safety. The rest of the party and town eventually manage to get the fire under control. Veridis Mov thanks the party for their intervention and sets about trying to organize stretchers for the wounded.  \nLater that day the party head to high point, (the highest building/point in Crux) where the local guards have a station and hold prisoners. They wish to speak to the Priestess, they're allowed into her cell where she is crying and shaking. The guards and Veridis explain she's been like that since she woke up and won't talk to them. The party try to interrogate her and Veridis warns them she is assumed innocent until proven guilty. The Kurask makes a vague threat about smiting evil and Stanley straight up slaps the priestess. The party are forcefully asked to leave high point which angers Kurask. \"How am I supposed to smite evil if they won't let me ask where the evil is to smite it!?\"  \n  \nThe next day they receive a messenger from Veridis Mov with a coin purse. A total of 2,000gp and a note of thanks for their heroism at the Carpenter's guild hall fire. The party meet with the ex-slaves and they venture forth to Ranais, the funereal world. Ranais is a dead prime material world that happens to have two rather close portals from Sigil to Crux making it an excellent trade route. The party enter a grey and dusty world, full of ruined buildings and ash. They followed a worn path that looked well traveled through the ash. It was a journey of about eight miles, which took them around four hours with the slaves. During this time they heard wails and moans, were accosted by more and more wraiths that would flee if attacked and refused to say anything other than \"Your lives are ours on which to feed! You belong to the lovelost!\"  \nOnce they arrived at the portal to Sigil they said their goodbyes, informed the slaves where they lived in Sigil if they needed further help and the slaves left through the portal to Sigil The party remained behind in Ranais.  \n  \n**Session 11**  \nThe party wanted to know what the Lovelost were, they noted that now the slaves were safe they could go back and explore. All the wraiths seemed to flee in the same direction, so that's the direction they went. As they got further and further they were attacked by more and more wraiths, some got close enough to get hits in before they were sent scurrying away. Then eventually the party entered a ruined amphitheater and there three wraiths stood still, watching the party. As the party spoke to them they began to speak.  \n*\"We are the lovelost. When this world died we were forced to live on, without home, without family, without love. Even when we died we lived on.... and on. And the one who did this to us was he whom we had worshipped He whom we had held above all others.  \nWe heard that, in time, even he had entered the halls of death, and this gave us joyless satisfaction. But now even that has been taken from us, for he lives again. His servants roam not only this world, but those nearby, for his former temple holds an ancient pathway. He seeks knowledge of that which he has lost, he seeks revenge.  \nYet as a speck can irritate the eyes of a man, a man can thwart the plans of an immortal - at least for a time. For can a man not eventually remove the speck? Pass through our city now, taste the fruit of his works. Choose your path afterward as you will. We will plague you no longer.\"*  \nWith that the wraiths faded away, ignoring questions from the adventurer's. Our Heroes decide to walk through the city and explore.  \n  \nOur Heroes hear music, see light and head toward it. A slow chanting to music becomes clear as they get closer and discover a temple, with worshipers in black robes gathered outside. Obscene runes and marks cover the outside of the structure. Evil hits Kurask like a truck as he detects evil and is stunned. Azreal fails his will save and feels compelled the enter the temple, when the party ask him where he's going he dreamily waves them off \"guys, it's a cool party, don't worry I'll be fine\" Roku manages to restrain the daydreaming sorcerer and as a he does the temple's illusions begin to fade, revealing the ruins, and the worshipers vanishing into mist. Norril identifies the runes and symbols as belonging to the cult of Orcus, a dead demon prince. Kurask notices an abomination of some kind and declares the attack.  \nThe Visage takes note it has been spotted and assaults the party's minds, Azreal fails his will save again and suddenly things the Visage is his ally and his party members are evil beings that need slaying... The rest of the party shrug off the mind games and attack. The Visage throws up some spells that daze the party and escapes into the floor and ground (it's incorporeal), the party regain their footing and tread warily for a moment but after a few minutes they realise it's not coming back. They enter the ruined temple of Orcus and Stanley works out there is a portal in here, but no idea how to open it. They make their way back to the Sigil portal, considering what they have learned.  \nThey step through to Sigil and find themselves in a building, face to face with a Formian Queen. The Queen sighs heavily at them and they realised this Formian is a little small and frailer than the average, it demands they leave and shows them the door. They apologise for trespassing and leave, realising they were in the clocktower in Sigil's market ward. They return to the store and find Dalan, the Planar Druid that helped them get to sigil is gravely ill...and a doctor is tending to him in their store. The party is quite confused and that's where we left it for next time...  \n  \n[Next Session](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2iv37q/saving_a_soul_from_hades_part_six_dd_35e_e6/)",

        "text": "Hello all. I wanted to try something new. I wanted a more detailed record of the journey thus far so I could reference and use past events in future plot and junk, and I sort of started to get carried away.... What follows is not by session, and some of the dialogue has been cleaned up, tightened, or reworded from shitty \"Roleplay Improv\" to make more sense. If there's enough interest I'll keep posting them. Let me know if you want to see more!\n\n**For King And Country**\n\n**Chapter 1: Sometimes The Bite is Worse**\n\nWe start our journey in the magnificent city of Stocot. Capital city and home to the king. It is sir Ewain’s graduation day. He is a brave Paladin of the Church of Isaac, sworn to an oath of fealty to the Royal Family. Upon completion of the academy, he is given a most important quest from the king himself. Upon completion of his quest, he is to be knighted. For Ewain could weep at the thought of wearing that most sacred of holy titles. The “Knight” of Stocot! Sir Ewain! He could think of no greater a fate than by the sword in search of such a title.\n\nHe is joined by a Halfling with a fire in his step, and a tranquility in his eyes. Elias Valentine, a man once of Passion and war, had become a crusader for nonviolence and peace. He was the willing sacrifice. The blade for the cause. Violence was the sin that took his daughter away. He would fight so others needn’t, and he would never needlessly take life, or impart unnecessary suffering. He would use this sin to be above it. to watch it closely. To know thy enemy as thyself.\n\nAlso the random dude Elias’s roommate brought over. This man was but a lowly thief. They were college buddies or something. The roommate was a half orc, the rogue a half elf. He sort-of shrugs and goes, “Yeah I can go do that with you guys…”\n\nThe King speaks. There are spies from the mysterious Island country of Tamaris. They have been in the country for at least thirty years and they have yet to be infiltrated. He tells them to go to Port Wendlebury, for it is believed to be their whereabouts.\n\nAnd the very next day they are at sea. They travel in style. The latest of coal-driven boats at their disposal. The Captain Godric, while gruff, becomes a man the party endears themselves to as the days of travel tick by. He is the proudest ship captain in all the land. There is a song or two about him you’ve probably heard at the local Pub.\n\nThey make a stop in the port town of Endlesmith, a small yet thriving town on the east bank. They head to the only pub in town while they wait for the captain to refuel the ship. As they file into the renown “Esmond’s Tu Tu” they are greeted by a man known only as Esmond Flannery. The crew swaps stories with the barkeep, a sharp witted young gentlemen with a passion in his eye. Esmond exudes class and charisma. He hears of our heros most noble of quests, and buys them all drinks. The three heros proceed to get ridiculously drunk and totally chill with Esmond all night. If only all nights of this most noble mission could be so pleasant as this one.\n\nThe Captain delivers the bad news at daybreak. Endlesmith hasn’t received it’s monthly shipment of coal. Esmond tells them of the bandits that have been raiding the shipping lines between Endlesmith and the City of Kromshold, nestled in the massive caverns of Mt. Ajar. Without that coal, the heroes cannot be on their way to Wendlebury to the north. The three great walls block all mainland access to the peninsula.\n\nSir Ewain always answers the call to adventure, and to aid the citizens of this kingdom. He will fight for all with the passion and dedication usually reserved for a small few. With this call to justice, Our heroes head forth to remove these bandits from the forest, and help the shipment reach Endlesmith safely and without incident.\n\nThey skirmish with a small band of goblins who attack them on the trail. They disarm and maim the party of goblins, and Elias’s edict calls to him. He spares them, and tends to their wounds. Elias, who speaks goblin (of course he does….) tells them he means them no harm. They are tied up and they spend the night with Elias by the fire, half enjoying conversation and smoking the pipe, and half terrified that their captors will push them into it.\n\nThey leave the prisoners to their fates at dawn, and are in Kromshold by day’s end. They head to the pub and a gruff Dwarven barkeep named Oswine tells them where to go about the coal, and they are off in a hurry. They are asked by the duke of the mountain to bring back the only surviving member of the last party to leave with the coal. They welcome the companionship of Cedric on their quest. He is regrettably useless with a blade, and but a hapless manager to oversee the shipment. He is but a missing father to a family living in Endlesmith, and the party is as always, eager to lend a hand to those in need. They encounter some monstrous Bugbears and engage in a brave and fierce encounter. They trade blows with the beasts, and one by one, are brought down beaten into the leafy foliage on the forest floor. The team seems bested. two of them reside in pools of Crimson, and one struggles to stand. The next blow from such a creature would surely be Sir Ewain’s demise.\n\nSuddenly, Cedric jumps out from the direction of camp. He is a blur color and steel. He deals with the beast in a single blow, and the danger is averted. As the team slips in and out of consciousness, Sir Ewain watches Cedric bring a knife to the Rogue’s throat.\n\n“Why doesn’t everyone breath for a second?,” he says as the rogue struggles weakly in his grip. Sir Ewain is stunned as he beholds the horror before him. This simple thief had become a comrade in arms.\n\nThey had fought together\n\nThey had bled together.\n\nand now there was a knife to his throat.\n\n“I’ll be taking that coal shipment now. When I’m well on my way I’ll kick the street rat over the side of the cart. Either of you moves and he’s dead.” his calmness sends chills down the would-be-Knight’s spine.\n\nEwain brings his middle finger and thumb together and holds his hand out towards the cart.\n\nHis knees quiver, but he forces them to remain firm. “You harm him and the coal shipment burns!” he shouts to the traitor before him. Ewain’s eyes flash with a fire unheard of for a person as injured as he. Cedric snickers. “Is that how much this one’s worth to you then? A cart of coal? Why are you being so stupid? I will kill him, just give me what I want….”\n\nThe Paladin, in a panic filled moment of passion and fury, lunges at Cedric. The traitor’s eyes show a split second of fear, and he cuts the thief’s throat end to end. Blood pours over the Rogue’s tunic and leather padding and he gurgles softly on his way to the ground.\n\nIn a flash Ewain has his sword in Cedric’s side, carving a solid lash into his torso. In another instant Cedric is lost in the local brush. Ewain takes pursuit, but he quickly loses sight of Cedric. His pain hitting him in waves, he limps back to the cart. He lies Elias across his steed and says a pious word for his comrade. His mind is focused, fueled solely by drive and adrenaline. He pushes through his pain to reach the town of Endlesmith.\n\nSir Ewain bursts into Esmond’s pub from the rain. As he lowers his cloak, he looks to Esmond Flannery with pleading eyes. This was not the noble deed he had envisioned. He was the pride of the academy. He was the top of his class. Didn’t that mean something? He was a hero set out to right a notorious evil by the king himself! Traveling with a party of brothers in arms, He feared neither death nor pain!\n\nWhy then were his knees quivering?\n\nWhy then could he not stop his hands from shaking?\n\nHe had entered that forest a brave and proud graduate with a chip on his shoulder, and had re-emerged white as a ghost. His title was worth nothing if he could not uphold it. He had accomplished his mission, but at what cost? He swayed and then righted himself. He tasted bile. Truly the taste of victory.\n\nAs the local Cleric treated their wounds, Ewain came to a firm conclusion. He would be better. He would become the Knight the bards would sing about. He would be worthy of the title, rather than simply covet it.\n\nWith a renewed sense of duty, our heroes set out to the Mysterious northern city of Wendlebury, to find the traitors lurking in plain sight. To expose the unknown spy guild of Tamaris.\n",

        "text": "Alright, so the last time we left off, the Taffy Puller and Mister Fields had busted a warehouse full of goons shipping crates of boom to a human-supremacist terrorist named Gabriel. Problem was, the boom was already gone and we had few leads to find out where it had gone or what Gabriel wanted it for.\n\nEveryone got to some down-and-dirty investigation as able. Taffy Puller went undercover as his Warren Sweet alter ego, doing work to track down information on the PRISM group from the A-plot. The Stranger continued to use his unique abilities to search, while Mister Fields tried to build leads using a weird metal-centric clairvoyance technique he'd picked up recently.\n\nEverything dropped when he got the call. Gabriel himself was on the line, and he wanted to play a game, to prove that superhumans were more destructive than helpful. He'd rigged an incoming passenger train to blow, and we didn't have long before it pulled into station and took a lot of innocent people with it.\n\nFields jumped into his car and started to work to see how many traffic laws he could break in a short span of time. Meanwhile, Taffy Puller slipped into an alleyway, switched from civilian clothes to his Taffy Puller outfit, and started on his normal method of locomotion, which alternated between swinging from large buildings and launching himself off rooftops using elastic force when necessary.\n\nWe got to the train, and things looked bad. Several cars plus an engine, and they were all rigged to blow. That rat-bastard Gabriel had even given several of the explosives unique triggering methods, making it more difficult to disarm them without setting them off. More importantly, there were goons on the train holding the passengers hostage, so the direct approach was going to be tricky.\n\nThat said, we went with our typical Plan A, with the Taffy Puller taking point and Mister Fields making sure things came out roses. TP went right through the roof, ending up on a fairly sparsely-populated passenger car. There were hostages sitting in some of the seats, and goons on either side. These were decent henchmen, too; rather than try to point their guns at the Taffy Puller, who was quite capable of shrugging off a slug or two, they aimed at the hostages and ordered TP to stand down.\n\nLuckily, the plan *wasn't* for the Taffy Puller to singlehandedly deal with the goons. While TP drew attention from the goons, Fields levitated around the train, identifying the explosives and their trigger methods. The bombs in the rear cars were set to detonate if the car decoupled or came into station.\n\nMeanwhile, more thugs had clustered around the Taffy Puller and were holding him at gunpoint, still threatening to go after the hostages if he tried anything. He held the standoff as long as he could, until Fields gave him an all-clear.\n\nFields used his ferrokinesis to disable the gun of the goon actually aiming at the hostages, and at the same time, the Taffy Puller broke out his syrup-sludge blast attack, engulfing the nearest thugs in sticky candy glue. Bowled off their feet by the blast, they were stuck to the ground and helpless. Man, he sometimes had problems fighting other supers, but that sludge-blast was *incredibly* broken when dealing with normal human thugs.\n\nStill, resolving the hostage situation was the least of the worries. Fields started using a targeted EMP blast to disable some of the detonators while TP worked to usher passengers into the rear of the train. Plan was to take out the explosives on the rear car, move all the passengers in there, sever the linkages to the other explosives and decouple the car, then deal with the rest of the train once the passengers were safe.\n\n\nIt was while doing this that the Taffy Puller came into contact with the train's engineer... who was slightly frantic. The entire engine had been wired to blow with the bulk of the remaining explosives. It was rigged to blow if it went under a certain speed... and the engine was already slowing as it prepared to come into station. There was enough explosive material on board that *any* kind of detonation would be catastrophic now that we were in the city, but the engineer told us that according to the schedule, they'd hit the detonation speed right as the engine passed a city convention center. That was... bad. It meant a lot of casualties.\n\nWe didn't have time to set up a fancy plan this time. A quick glance at a map gave us our only chance. The train track ran near a river that cut through part of the city. If we could derail the train and get it into the river, the water would contain the explosion and prevent a lot of the damage. Trouble was, neither one of us could lift or move a train by any stretch of the imagination, and there was quite a distance between the water and the tracks.\n\nTaffy Puller and Mister Fields shared a salute as they went to work. Fields floated ahead of the train and began pushing on it with every bit of telekinetic force he could muster while the engineer triggered the emergency brakes and then looked for a safe opportunity to ditch. The Taffy Puller stuck himself to the engine, then lashed out with his arms and snagged a sturdy-looking building, also connecting himself there with the full power of his stickiness ability.\n\nThis was a harrowing few rounds, because we were all pushing as hard as we could. Fields had to find a way to slow the engine enough that we wouldn't overshoot the target, and meanwhile Taffy clung for dear life, the DM allowing him to drastically exceed the normal maximum limits of his stretching for the special circumstances. Pushing like this drains your endurance quickly in HERO mechanics, so both of our heroes were quickly running dry and having to burn STUN (think nonlethal damage HP) in place of endurance.\n\nFields broke off first, having a lower endurance pool than the Taffy Puller. He got himself clear just as the train hit the bridge. The Taffy Puller was running on fumes at this point, too, and so... he let go of the building he'd been clinging to.\n\nHis hyperstretched body started to snap back like a clipped high-tension wire. With the last of his energy, he formed one of his huge hard-rock-candy boxing gloves, and slammed it into the side of the train engine with all the force he'd built up from being stretched to the breaking point and well beyond.\n\nFun quirk about HERO, and one of my favorite mechanics in the system: The Move Through. HERO features two main velocity-based attack maneuvers; the Move Through and the Move By. The Move By is basically a running clothesline or equivalent, while the Move Through is a charging tackle; both get scaling bonus damage based on how fast the attacker is moving at the time of impact, allowing you to deal some pretty fantastic damage but causing the attacker to also take recoil damage from the hit. I declared that what the Taffy Puller was doing was a Move Through attack against the train with everything he had. Normally it's hard to hit with this maneuver at high speed, but against a target the size of a train there was virtually no way I was going to miss.\n\nThe Taffy Puller hit that engine like the wrath of an angry Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man, and I ended up rolling no less than 40d6 for damage, the single largest effect roll I've ever performed or witnessed before or since. He went out the way he lived: refusing to throw away a long-standing tendency to call his attacks, the last thing he screamed before he hit was the name of the rock-candy super punch attack, *\"CANDY ROCKER!\"*\n\nHERO's got some cool knockback mechanics, and while an object the size of a train has enough knockback resistance to prevent it being pushed around by even superhero-tier punches, pretty much *nothing* has enough knockback resistance to hold back against a 40d6 hit. The impact practically splattered the Taffy Puller, but it also sent the train flying a good twenty meters. Engine, cars, and Taffy Puller all vanished beneath the water of the river seconds before the whole thing blew, sending a huge geyser of water fountaining into the air and seriously jostling anyone unlucky enough to be on or near the water at the time, but otherwise doing little damage.\n\n\nThe shocker, the part I didn't expect, was that the Taffy Puller was **still alive** after all this. His high natural resilience, *very* high BODY score (lethal damage cap), and bonus special resistances to exactly that kind of impact damage had all conspired to ensure that when he went into the water he was an absolute mess, but he was still breathing.\n\nMister Fields shucked his trenchcoat and dove into the water after him. By following his metal senses, he was able to track down the wreckage of the engine quite quickly, and he managed to find the broken, bleeding Taffy Puller. Shocked as anyone else that the Taffy Puller was still alive, he dragged him to shore, where medics among the rapidly-growing crowd immediately went to work trying to stabilize him.\n\nGabriel got away that day; even with an ability to speed his healing by gorging on candy and refined sugar, the Taffy Puller was still down for days. But that was one of my all-time favorite sessions, and a major high-five moment between me and JusticeDude, who actually more or less formed the most effective partnership I've ever had at a gaming table over the course of the Taffy Puller/Mister Fields adventures.\n\nAnd I'll always remember the day that the Taffy Puller punched a train full of explosives into the water.\n\n\n\nNEXT TIME: The Downfall of Dragon Knight",

        "text": "Alright, here's another one. This is the first part of the Gabriel Saga.\n\nAs a B-plot to the overarching PRISM storyline (which typically took place whenever ThatGuy wasn't in attendance), Taffy Puller and Mister Fields tangled with a human supremacist (IE: hates supers/metahumans) terrorist who went by the name Gabriel.\n\nOur first encounter with him was a bit ominous; he'd set firebombs in an apartment block. We arrived pretty late, and by the time we got there we couldn't stop the bombs from going off. It was pretty much just a statement to us, the jerk.\n\nMister Fields set about levitating and saving people trapped in the upper floors, while Taffy Puller used what's called a Power skill. This is a skill roll that lets you attempt to perform a feat that you don't have an explicit ability for, but which should logically be within your established power set. That few points came in handy several times.\n\nAnyway, Taffy Puller starts hosing down the apartment block with the candy glue he usually uses to imprison thugs, while Fields saves stragglers. It doesn't take us long to settle things down, and we wind up with no leads on Gabriel. That's fine. Time to turn to the single best GMPC ever made.\n\nThe Stranger was nominally part of our group, but refused to participate in any actual operations. The nature of his powers made that okay by us, because the Stranger would have been worthless in a fight. Instead, he helped shore up our intelligence-gathering capabilities.\n\nThe Stranger's powers revolved around anonymity and crowds. He could step into a crowd of people and partly influence their actions through a sort of partial group hypnosis. He had perfect visual shapeshifting, so he could look like anyone at any time, and he could literally teleport between one crowd and another. Many times, a beautiful woman, a young child, an old man, you name it-they'd step out of a faceless crowd and start talking to us in the Stranger's typical gruff, sarcastic voice.\n\nWith the Stranger's help we tracked down a warehouse. Problem was, the warehouse was full of thugs, and we didn't see any good way of assaulting it before they could destroy any evidence or get out. We also weren't too interested in racking up the kind of body count assaulting a warehouse full of normal-but-armed humans would bring, especially considering that despite some powerful defenses neither TP nor Mister Fields were bulletproof.\n\nA plan was hatched, working around one of the Taffy Puller's odder tertiary powers. He can squeeze himself into and through very tight spaces; in HERO terms, it's built as a Desolidification effect with the built-in disadvantage of not actually protecting him from attacks (basic Desolidification renders you immune to attacks not tuned to either a weakness or specifically built to hit Desolidified targets). In actual terms, it meant that the Taffy Puller could fit comfortably into... well, just about any damn thing, in addition to squeezing himself through cracks and holes as small as a bullet hole if he had the time.\n\nSo, the thugs at this warehouse get a knock on the door. It's a gangly guy in an apron, wheeling a freakin' hotdog cart. \"Yo, this the expo, right? Someone ordered catering?\" Thugs tell gangly guy to piss off, and they take his cart away from him. They wheel it inside while the guy protests, and set it aside while they go back to their business.\n\nThere's a thumping sound from within the hotdog cart. Head thug comes up and inspects it, asks which moron brought the damn thing inside. Some guy says that he was hungry, gets smacked in the head by the boss, who then gives the cart a kick. It starts to rumble, and they back away slowly, beginning to reach for their guns.\n\nThen the fucking thing *EXPLODES* as the Taffy Puller bursts free, immediately using the element of surprise (and his slightly-better-than-human speed) to start spraying gunk bombs around indiscriminately.\n\nTaffy Puller's gunk bombs are built in HERO as an Entangle effect. This can be anything from a web blast to a brick twisting a metal girder around you to keep you in place. He had two different versions of the attack; the regular blast, which hit a single guy, and a wide-area explosive version that could hit several. The area version features a weaker Entangle that's easier to break free of... but it's still well outside the range where the average human can burst free in any kind of reasonable time frame.\n\nIt took seconds for a good chunk of the thugs to be rendered helpless, at which point Mister Fields, having shucked his apron and donned his shades and trenchcoat, came through the wall and started a rampage. Several of them did get shots off, and the Taffy Puller took a few bullets, but as I noted in the Rage installment, TP is a tough dude and a couple glancing blows didn't do anything more than rattle his cage.\n\nDidn't take us long to bag the whole operation. We searched the place and interrogated some of the thugs, but what we found raised more questions than answers.\n\nThese guys were running weapons, and all the goods were already gone. Gabriel had himself a big ol' box of explosives, and we still had no leads on finding the son of a bitch.\n\n\nNEXT TIME: in which the Taffy Puller punches a train",

        "text": "This is a story about one of the gaming sessions we had when I was in college, and it's stuck with me ever since. A bit of a backstory before we jump in. Liam was our DM, and he was a great story teller. He really liked his world-building and would typically run his own home-brew worlds instead of boxed settings. He also didn't suffer fools lightly, and was more than willing to kill a PC if the player did something stupid. In his mind, \"Lawful Good\" did not equal \"Lawful Dumbass\", and actions had consequences. There were three of us who wanted to play D&amp;D with him. The three of us were fairly experienced and had played before, so we knew what to expect when Liam told us he wouldn't be pulling any punches. He proved that in a pre-session we had that ended up with us rolling up new characters because we screwed up an entire city (but that's another tale for another time). After that and one other session with our new characters (a Fighter, a Cleric, and a Wizard), we realized we really needed a fourth to round out the team. We put the call out among our other friends that we knew had played before and we got one response, from Chuck. Chuck was an ok guy, but his characters tended to be munchkined-out caricatures of heroes that had no business being played in a serious game of D&amp;D. He also was the pushy type that could be annoying if he didn't get his way, and didn't know Liam that well. Here's how the session went, as best as I can recall:\n\nLiam: Ok, guys, we'll get the ball rolling here. You other three have already had me check your character sheets last time so you're good to go. Chuck is going to be joining us, so let's see your sheet.\n\nChuck: S'up? (hands his sheet to Liam)\n\n(Liam looks at the sheet)\n\nLiam: Oh...kaaaay. So you want your character to be named \"Ladicius\"... that's \"Suicidal\" backwards? And you've listed him as being CE with the \"Ninja\" class?\n\n(The rest of the party was varying shades of \"Good\", but Liam wasn't against mixed-alignment groups)\n\nChuck: Yeah! He's this totally badass psycho ninja with a katana and poison darts and throwing stars and...\n\nLiam: (cutting him off) Ok, but you do realize that's out of the range of what we had planned for this game? I could let you play a thief instead and...\n\nChuck: No way, I want to play a badass psycho ninja. I'm not taking some pre-made character.\n\nLiam: (annoyed but resigned, because he just wants to get the game on) Fine. Let's just get this thing going. (DM Hat ON) When we left off last week you three were heading in to the catacombs and had just made it to the first room. There are three exits heading off of it, to the East, West, and stairs down to the South.\n\nChuck: I head South!\n\nLiam: You're not there with them.\n\nChuck: What?\n\nLiam: You're not in the room with them. When they entered the catacombs you weren't in the party.\n\nChuck: Aw, come on!\n\nLiam: You'll have to be patient. I'll get you worked in soon enough.\n\nChuck: But I want to play now!\n\nLiam: (withering stare) I'll. Get. You. Worked. In.\n\nAt this point any rational player would STFU and STFD, but Chuck kept pressing his luck and continued to bitch to Liam as the rest of the party worked their way down a potentially trap-laden stairway to the south. It led down into a large, round room where we couldn't see the ceiling. We were told that looked like it was the cellar of a tower we had seen outside, although all the intermediate wooden floors had long since rotted and collapsed in. Liam then told us that had the floors still been there we probably could have come in through the tower instead of the cavern entrance. There were no other exits out except for the stairway where we came in. He also noted that there was a white substance on most of the walls in the room and that there was what appeared to be a man clad in black lying on the floor of the room.\n\nChuck: HELL YEAH, LET'S GET GOING! I stand up and head out the door.\n\nLiam: You're unconscious and at zero hit points. You're not going anywhere until they heal you.\n\nChuck: WHAT?!?!?\n\nLiam: Hey, you wanted to be in on the session as soon as possible. Also, add a Spider Kit to your inventory.\n\nMe: I'm the heal-bot (Cleric), I'll check him out and see if he's conscious. \n\nLiam: He's out cold and pretty banged up. He has a lot of wounds that look like punctures and slashes.\n\nMe: I lay on hands to heal him.\n\nLiam: Ok, I'll let you do that and then everyone needs to roll initiative.\n\nGroup: *groans*\n\nSince Chuck was being a PITA about getting included immediately, Liam wrote him in as a guy who was trying to solo his way into the catacombs using spider-climbing gear. The giant spiders that had taken up residence in the upper part of the tower took exception to an invader to their turf and beat the hell out of him but didn't follow up and kill him after knocking him off the walls. The team made it out of the battle, but not without having to heal Chuck back from the brink of death two more times because he was being an idiot and not letting our fighter take the point against the enemies. We managed to kill the spiders, but we ended up having to head back to the nearby town to rest and recuperate due to being low on HP and potions. We unanimously decided to head back to the inn where we had rented rooms.\n\nLiam: Ok, so you limp back into The Twisted Staff, battered and beaten. What do you want to do?\n\nChuck: This is an Inn with a bar, right? I WANT TO GET HAMMERED!\n\nRest of us: *groans and eyerolls as we opt to head for our rooms and rest*\n\nLiam: Ok, what's your Con score again? (Chuck tells him, Liam rolls a couple times) Allrighty. You drink for a while and you're totally plastered. What else do you want to do?\n\nChuck: Are there any hot chicks in the bar?\n\nRest of us: *resounding facepalms*\n\nLiam: (rolls a couple times) As far as you can tell, there are.\n\nChuck: I want to try and hit on them!\n\nLiam: (makes a couple more rolls) You chat up a couple of them and one seems to be interested in you.\n\nChuck: Is she hot?\n\nLiam: (glances down at the dice) You think she's an 11 on a scale of one to ten.\n\nChuck: Hell yeah! I'm going to take her back up to my room!\n\nRest of us: *heads shaking, looks of disbelief*\n\nLiam: She happily follows you to your room.\n\nChuck: AW YEAH, Ladicius is gettin' LAID!\n\nLiam: (rolls a few more times) Yep, you get lucky and then pass out with her in bed.\n\nAt this point, Chuck has a massive shit-eating grin on his face.\n\nLiam: The rest of you get a full night's sleep, note it accordingly. Ladicius, I'm going to let you get back your full HP even though you didn't get a full rest, but you'll take a penalty to Con and Dex checks due to the hangover.\n\nChuck: Don't care, GOT LAID!\n\nLiam: Yes, about that. You wake up in the morning and the woman you took to bed is still sleeping, with your arm under her. You see her yellow-blond hair spill down her naked back and the hint of a slightly pointed ear poking up from under the hair that's covering her face.\n\nChuck: Aw yeah, I knocked boots with an elf!\n\nLiam: As she wakes and rolls over on your arm, you are greeted by her smiling face, ample bosom, and long, flowing blonde beard...\n\nChuck: *makes choking noises*\n\nRest of us: *snickering and holding back laughter*\n\nLiam: She introduces herself as Dinarra, and thanks you for being such a gentle lover last night. She then remarks that it is hard to find anyone who is interested in having relations with half-dwarf and asks if you are betrothed to any maiden of the land as she traces her hand down your chest.\n\nChuck: *looks pale and about to throw up*\n\nLiam: Mead-goggles are a bitch, eh?\n\nRest of us: (laughing uproariously) YOU BANGED A DWELF!!!!\n\nStrangely enough, Chuck didn't come back for the next session.\n",

        "text": "Good day, gents. Pull up a chair. I just discovered this subreddit, and after laughing my ass off at some of the top-rated stories, I figured I'd share one of my old characters. I have a few more for later, but this one is special to me.\n\nHERO system. I love it, I really do, and this was one of my biggest introductions to it. The only other players were JusticeDude and ThatGuy, and together, we formed one misfit mess of a team.\n\nJusticeDude, being unsure about the whole thing, rolled together a ferrokinetic dude with a lot of Magneto thrown in. Basically described as JusticeDude in a trenchcoat, Mister Fields had turned to superheroing after making a fortune cheating at roulette and getting ejected from every casino in Vegas using his magnetic powers.\n\nThatGuy wound up being assisted with his character, and made DragonKnight. DragonKnight was a cool tanky dude with powerful magic fire blasts, and a significant chunk of his points were spent on his partner, an actual red dragon, which lived on the roof of the building where he lived. There is a story in this later if anyone's interested; there's a reason I refer to him by the catchall term ThatGuy.\n\nI, for my part, wanted to harken back to old-school Golden/Silver-Age superheroes and villains, specifically the kind with oddly-specific and weird power sets. I remembered seeing some of those old-style taffy-pulling machines in Gatlinburg, Tennessee (there's like four shops there on the main street that have them on display where they make the taffy), and inspiration hit.\n\nWarren Sweet, owner and proprietor of the high-class chocolate shop known as the \"Sweet Shoppe,\" was working in the back room one day on a project. A bolt of NONDESCRIPT SUPERHERO ENERGY zapped him, and he fell onto one of those machines and got caught. What should have been a gruesome-but-sugary death turned miraculous; he was reborn, with his body exhibiting the powers and properties of CANDY!\n\nCampy as hell, I'm aware, but god damn did I love this dude. One of my all-time favorite characters. Mix one part stretching powers (more akin to Luffy from One Piece than classic stretchers like the Elongated Man/Mister Fantastic) with a few other fun themed abilities, most notably the ability to render himself ultra-sticky, the ability to throw blobs of super-gooey candy glue that could hopelessly ensnare anyone short of high brick-level super strength or energy blasting powers, and a sunny, sweet outlook on life. Finish off with the tendency to occasionally break out absolutely rancid candy-related puns and you've got the general idea. \n\n\nOne of our first calls wound up being just TP and Mister Fields; ThatGuy missed the session for whatever reason. We got called to deal with some trouble, but what we found was several metahumans from a color-themed gang called PRISM (I think this was an old Champions pregen with some later house mods, but I'm not sure).\n\nI don't remember the other guys, but the real standout was a guy named RAGE. Think Red Hulk. Huge slab of beef fueled by blood and liquid angry, with red skin. The rest of his gang was actually not all that big a deal for us to deal with, but RAGE had sky-high defenses.\n\nTP left Fields to deal with the rest and stepped up to Rage. Rage promptly punched him hard enough to stop a speeding car.\n\nTaffy Puller no-sold it. See, he's not quite in Rage's league in terms of toughness, and his defenses against energy blasts and such were piss-poor, but his taffy-boned body was incredibly resilient, and a punch from a dude like Rage was well within the realm of things he take relatively easily.\n\nHe wound up and struck back at Rage with the Candy Rocker. Encased his fist in a huge red boxing glove made of ultradense rock candy and smashed Rage in the face with it.\n\nUnfortunately, Rage no-sold that one.\n\nThis was going nowhere good; TP didn't have the means to actually hurt a beeftank like Rage, but Rage could eventually KO the Taffy Puller if he kept swinging for a while.\n\nSo I rolled a skill check to taunt the big guy. Rage roars at him and goes in for a headbutt. Just what I was waiting for. TP activates his hyper-stickiness power and glues himself *to Rage's face.*\n\nRage promptly freaks out and starts trying to pry him off, but the Taffy Puller's stickiness power is actually  right on Rage's strength tier; he was not going to get me loose without prying off most of his face with it.\n\nAnother taunt roll, and TP convinces the guy that jumping is the answer. We're on floor 1 of a massive high-rise hotel, and Big Red bunches up muscles like steel cables and launches himself face-first through about six of them.\n\nTaffy Puller stays on.\n\nRage is absolutely frothing at the mouth at this point, and decides that more is better. He powers up again, launches himself through another seven floors.\n\nTaffy Puller is still glued to his face and still hanging on, despite having just taken the better part of a hotel full on.\n\nOne more super leap, and we wind up on the roof. Taffy Puller is looking pretty ragged at this point; he can stay latched all day, but he's woozy from all of the weaponized architecture and if he passes out he'll fall off. Still, he taunts one more time, suggesting that he's barely holding on and he's not sure if he can stand another leap.\n\nRage obliges, powering up and launching himself as high into the air as he can go.\n\nMeanwhile, the Taffy Puller deactivates his stickiness and drops to the ground, watching Big Red sail straight upward.\n\nI grin, and lazily pull out more dice. This was one of my favorite aspects of the HERO system; it got a little unwieldy, but the tactile joy of rolling up a 12d6 for damage never got old. With the time to wind up, though, I was able to push it all the way up to maximum; a 16d6 haymakered swing, something that TP usually wouldn't have the time to ready up. But Rage was going to spend several combat phases on a relatively-predictable ballistic trajectory. \n\nBy the time he came back down to the roof, the Taffy Puller was waiting for him with a maxed-out Candy Rocker, and he punched Rage so hard he wound up sticking out of the next building over.\n\nThings cooled off after that. Rage's companions had long since fled without their beef golem in play to back them up, and while Rage had actually managed to stay up through smashing a hotel into ruins with his face and getting catapulted into a second, he quickly decided he didn't want any more of that business and ran off.\n\nThat was our first real fight as a team: the day the Taffy Puller spent most of the session glued to the enemy brick's face.",

        "text": "Alright, so our party is a CN human rogue/wannabe sky-pirate(me), CG minotaur demon(former minotaur paladin), GN drug addict Ranger and a CN Bard(wielder of a singing sword).\nOn our random adventure's we stumbled across an orchard of very rare and hard to cultivate tree's, the roots of which happened to be the rangers narcotic of choice.So while he cut the roots for a stash \nand I cut them to sell i noticed we were being watched, by a bird man(peregrine falcon specifically). We began speaking with him, his squawks and whistles being interpreted by the bard.\nTurns out he was on and expedition to harvest the entire orchard and was from a floating, invisible city to the far east. Having gained this information in exchange for a vial of dog drool,\nhis race's narcotic of choice, we wandered further into the orchard due to the bird-men seeming fairly aggressive.\nFurther toward the center of the immaculate orchard we met it's keeper, an adult black dragon by the name of Watayru. We judged by the extreme dilation of his eyes we assumed he used\nthe roots of the trees for much the same reason as our ranger.However this particular drug makes the user particularly susceptible to the effects of music and seeing as the \nranger spoke draconian, we formed a plan.The bard started playing his violin while the minotaur and I provided further background music through beat-boxing, while the ranger rap-battled him.\nSick rhymes were busted and the entire scene can only be described as dope, but through mad skills we gained the trust and friendship of Wataryu. Then having pointed him in the direction of the \nbird-man logging camp, and following him, seen his grief and the mass destruction. He has become enraged to the point of murderous aggression and his high has come down pretty hard,which is when he invites us onto his back. We then set off to assault the magic,floating,invisible city of jerkish bird-men.Us being four adventurers and a dragon.\nAs we pass the barrier of invisibility we see the city is actually suspended by five massive chains attached to a huge magic flying rock, and our battle plan is formed.we instruct Wataryu to start\ncutting the chains where the connect at he top of the rock and he begins to ascend. Then we are attacked by the first of the bird-man defenses, and our dragon is shot in the rear by a baillista.\nOnce we disembark from the dragon's back our minotaur with aid from the ranger dislodges the ballista shot form the dragon without causing further harm. With further aid from the ranger he manages,\nwith pinpoint accuracy and immense force, to throw the shot right back and entirely disable the cities lone artillery station.At this point myself and the bard were making our way down the chains\nto the city floor, and noticed 24 bird-men flying up the chains. I killed one with a throw from my trusty grappling hook and the bard killed six and terrified the rest with a well timed thunder \nwave. Much higher up the chain the other two had started working down towards us, the minotuar killed one but the ranger was knocked off the chain. Seeing this I threw out my grappling hook again\nand he just about caught it. He rope burned the skin off his hand and still hit the ground but was still half alive and i joined him on the ground.However the bard was then also knocked off and we\ntried to catch him, but ended up doing more harm than good. But he was still alive and it was therefore a success, we were then joined by the minotaur and all four of us were now on the ground. It\nwas at this point that Wataryu finished cutting the chain. This gargantuan kilometer long chain with links the size of a small car destroys any part of the city it contacts and is long enough to \ndrape over the edge and touch the ground, throwing the city off balance. With everything in chaos we start looting, we find good, valuable treasure which included a rather ornate shield. We also \nreclaimed the harvested coal-root for personal use and called the dragon. At this point we notice a regimented cloud of bird-men, doing what we assume to be preparations to dive bomb us with their\nbeaks. After Wataryu lands we climb atop him and start ascending. The bird-men then maneuver in front of us and are about to attack.It is at this point Wataryu launches a huge blast of fire right \ninto the middle of their ranks.This annihilates half of the over thirty bird-men, and the rest dive at us. I stand atop the dragons shoulders and hold the looted shield in front of me and the\nrest got ready to attack. All of us got through the assault fine, except for the bard. He was hit in the neck by the beak of one of the birds, which he then instantly killed. We escaped, just about.\nThe bird-men were too busy with their homes to chase us. The ranger was just able to patch up the bard till we got him to a proper healer.\nOverall I call it a success and we came out with a bunch of loot and a powerful new friend.And that is our story of petty revenge through minor genocide.  \n\nEDIT:The bard is still alive.

The streets overflowed with Sabbat amok, and the Domain was officially folding. Prince called the final Elysium, wanted everyone there for protection while the Primogen organised an escape. What was left of the domain was in attendance, all thirty or so. Jalees was not the last to arrive, but he was in the last 5. The PCs noticed as Jalees walked in that he looked ready for war - far more so than he had ever looked.\n\nJalees had spent the day preparing. His handler had acquired a Lasombra Abyss Mystic to cast a few rituals to help him prepare - one that created a pocket of night in his haven that lasted the entire day, and another that allowed him to see clearly in that pocket of night ( [Empowering the Shroud of Night and Pact of Shadow](https://www.scribd.com/doc/67189745/abyss-mysticism), respectively ). Jalees was then able to spend all day casting his own rituals completely unhindered. \n\nJalees walked into Elysium that night loaded up to his eyes with magic: Power of Invisible Flames, Pavis of Foul Presence, Deflection of Wooden Doom, Invisible Chains of Binding, and Blood of Potency (drop to Gen 5) (Path of Blood:3) with Four Shafts of Belated Quiescence, Four Splinter Servants, Six uses of Extinguish, and a necklace of 14 Bloodstones. He also carried four scimitars, two on either hip, one set with Scorpion’s touch (Qui:2, 4 successes, 6 points) the other with Baal’s Caress ( Qui:4, 6 points). He had spent around 40 points of blood over the course of the day, and had just topped up again - a few more mortal lives for the cause.\n\nThe Elysium had a few secret exits, but one was most easily used for an escape route as it lead directly to a secondary carport in one of the basements that emerged onto a street three blocks down. It was here that Jalees had instructed his backup to wait. He had gathered a small group of exceedingly effective stealth agents - two Lasombra ( Lasombro and AbyssMystic ), two Assamite, one Serpent of the Light and one Tzimisce. They waited in the darkness for Jalees to bring them victims.\n\nThe Prince addressed the Elysium, announcing that the escape plan was ready, and that it would commence shortly. An explosion rocked the building, another shortly after that. A ghoul came in, spoke quietly to the Prince, then ran off again - he was leaking blood at a somewhat alarming rate. Prince repealed his earlier statement, *someone* had just exploded the two armored trucks (classic money trucks) that had been procured for evacuation, and he was having to find another way.\n\nJalees hurried over to the Prince and relayed that he had a backup plan for this very purpose, which he had put together with Regent and the Gangrel Primogen, both of which had already taken the exit. He could lead groups of four or five out, but it would take some time for each group to be safe before he could come back for another group. The Prince polled the other Primogen, then the ST had me roll Persuasion to convince the assembled vamps as a whole - 16 successes on 12 dice, luck was with me. The entire Domain was convinced and, in a self-conscious yet self-preserving way, split into groups of four before patiently waiting their turn.\n\nJalees could hardly contain his ecstatic joy as he led the first group down the hallway to the exit, through the hidden door, across the antechamber, and out into the carport. As he walked out the door, he received a mental knock, then a codeword. He responded with the all green signal, and a Shroud of Night (Obten:2) popped into existence on the four victims following him. He hit them with Invisible Chains, the other Lasombra drew his Arms of the Abyss(Obten:3) into the fore, piling on even more grapples, allowing the Tzimisce time to Fleshcraft (Vic:2) the victim’s arms and legs together, effectively turning them into slugs. They were completely unable to resist any further actions.\n\nEach vamp that had spent blood drank his fill, then Jalees used some rather ridiculously large containers he had previously augmented with Preserve Blood to store some excess blood before draining the first victim down to one blood point. He then began the Ritual of the Bitter Rose on that victim.\n\nAs is said: “Lather, rinse, repeat.”\n\nBy the time the seventh group had been dealt with, the group had gained a collective 13 generations - Jalees none at all, of course, but his brothers and sisters benefitted much. Their newfound power had increased their effectiveness dramatically, and each group was completed more quickly than the last. They were down to two remaining groups: the Sheriff, the Prince, and the Scourge, and the PCs.\n\nThe NPCs were first, of course. Jalees wasted no time in hurrying them down to the carport, but paused in the antechamber to move himself to the back of the group. As he exited, he hit all three of them with the most powerful blast of Invisible Flames as he could before the rest of everything went down as usual. The group waited until the three had worn themselves down before conducting a new Ritual that Jalees had created on the fly - Rite of Marduk’s Favor, a ritual that allows a vamp to combine many higher generation vampires in an effort to still gain the effects of diablerie. (I’ll detail the full effects if someone wants, but it’s fairly simple). Jalees’ first test subjects were these three, and it performed beautifully - Jalees was now 6th generation.\n\nSheet changes: Celerity 7, [Flower of Death](http://reference.l2fury.com/index.php/Flower_of_Death)\n\nWhen Jalees led the PCs out of the back door, Ventrue’s player was the first to quip “and now he stabs us in the back, right?” I would have replied, but Jalees had just hit them with another full-power Invisible Flames. They were not told why they should roll Fortitude to soak damage, they assumed another bomb had gone off, and had taken some damage from it.\n\nJalees, meanwhile, activated full Celerity, plus Flower of Death, and brutally crippled each of the PCs. He was able to bring them down to 1 Stamina, with about 2 health levels remaining (each). The Lasombras skipped Shroud this time, both bringing Arms up and wrapping the PCs tight. The players wrote expressions of shock and incredulity. Jalees was too smart to bathe in the PC’s defeat, however, and performed the Rite of Marduk’s Favor again. Tremere was the first to die, Malkavian was second, then Ventrue, finally Brujah. Jalees had used almost none of his preparations for the night - only Invisible Flames, Invisible Bindings and his swords.\n\nPermanent 5th Generation Jalees Kamal hauled his ridiculously large pots of Preserved Blood into the van, making sure to pad them adequately to avoid any possible mishaps while the others swept up the last of the ash into individual baggies, tagging each with the name of the deceased contained within. They had 32 baggies in total, tossed into a larger garbage bag which they loaded into the van as well. The Sabbat had won the Domain, and Jalees would spend the next few nights hunting down the rest of the Anarchs and the few straggling Camarilla that did not make it to the final Elysium.\n\n-- --\n\nThe players sat in stunned silence for a while - or left their computer to rage out, I cannot know. It was about 15 minutes before they said anything else:\n\n&gt;Ventrue: “How long has Jalees been planning on doing this sort of thing?”  \n&gt;Jalees: “He was created with the goal in mind.”  \n&gt;Malkavian: “How did you get him to sign off on it?”  \n&gt;J: “My previous character was dead within the first game. Revenge was a bit high on my list.”  \n&gt;M: “But how? I don’t think I could ever come up with something half as awesome as that was, and doubly so never play it to the hilt.”  \n&gt;J: “I stared small, and then grew the concept. I had to badger him a bit, and I probably got more than I should have, but I really, really wanted to kill all of your characters. The way you treated someone new to your game was appalling, and needed to be corrected. I tapped my Sith side a bit.”  \n&gt;V: *Begins to complain about how unfair this sort of ending is*  \n&gt;Brujah: “Shut up man. He played us like a fiddle. That was the one ending that could make me feel better about what *you* forced us to do in the first place.”  \n&gt;V: *Complains harder about how John Random would have ruined the game*  \n&gt;Tremere: “Bro, we will never know how he would have been played. We killed that character so quickly, there was no chance to see what would happen. Shut your damn mouth.”  \n&gt;V: *Rages about how unfair we’re being*  \n&gt;ST: “Ventrue, I never want you in another of my games again.” *Kicks Ventrue from server*  \n&gt;J: “Don’t take this personally, guys. I was actually a bit sad to kill all of you at the end. You all play well, and I think you have the potential to have some fairly intricate characters. Being murderhobos is not the best way of playing *any* game.”  \n&gt;All: *paraphrase* “It was nice of you to continue on, and it was a really awesome character. Do you think you’ll stick around for our next game?” *other random questions*  \n\nI hung around for a while making small talk, and generally getting to know a couple of the people and having a fun time. I would end up not joining their next game (DnD 3.5e over chat? ick to the max), and I eventually fell out of contact with them. Hopefully I did my part in helping them be better players. I know that the situation that they put me in, and I accepted, pushed me to be both a better player and a more diverse player. \n\nI had a great time overall, and I still have that character sheet for use when needed. I (briefly) had a chance to play him in a friend’s LARP as a Dominion of a Black Hand Column that was called in by the local Hand member for assistance. Jalees, having since moved away from Path of Blood to Path of Honorable Accord, almost wrecked the game. It was fun.",

        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2iiiqi/through_the_memories_of_an_old_senile_man_to_find/",
        "text": "So I was looking for ideas for campaigns and came across the idea for players to go through the memories of an old man looking for something he has lost, and his memories were always slightly wrong or exaggerated and he couldn't specifically remember every detail.\n\nI decided to use a rotating tower for the location, there were 3 layers to it, an outer ring that rotated left, a middle one that rotated right, and a center that rotated left. They would rotate a bit randomly, according to when the old senile man decided he remembered it. (random rolls mostly.)\n\nI allowed the players to map it out if they choose to, they did a few rooms before getting lost and giving up on the mapping, remember that, it was a mistake that nearly killed them.\n\nThere were about 15 rooms in here:\n\n1) A main entrance that describes that the tower is the tomb of a great artificer named Phein who created it, the tower would be his place of death and place of afterlife.\n\n2) A lab where another artificer by the name of Riley Emanuel took residence here learning from Phein's writings. Rileys master, Frank Stein, who was taught by Phein in life told Riley to come here after he taught him everything he could. The pcs ended up fighting Riley, but after they killed his constructs he begged for life, the pcs are good, and since he explained he is just here to learn they let him live. It helped that after they attacked him he turned into a woman, more of the old man just forgetting what was really here.\n\n3) Fun trap in this room. They brute half orc it was really meant for however wasn't here for it though. It's a circle room with a hole in the center for one medium sized creature, and the ceiling starts to lower. However the ceiling will leave a gap of 2 feet allowing everyone in the room to live. One pc, the ranger, has a companion with him who he adores so he convinces the other players to let her go in. Everyone is freaking out looking around and then I tell them the ceiling lowers, they all get crushed...everyone is so confused. Kick in with the old man \"**Ohh, wait no sorry, I forgot this trap is broken, I disabled it, there should be a gap for everyone to live.**\"\n\n4) A servants room of sorts. In here there were 3 different types of constructs. \n\n* Stone statues \n* Metal statues\n* Machines\n\nAll constructs in range will attack when a player walks by them, pcs are free to tumble check through.\n\n* The stone statues within 5ft come alive when the players attack a Machine.\n* The metal statues within 5ft come alive when the players attack a stone statue.\n* The Machines within 5ft come alive when the players attack a stone statue\n\nAlso, when they reached the half point of the room, the old man describes the room in a different way and all the constructs move to a new random location. They managed to activate about half of them, also, during the boss fight one player had to run through this room to get back.\n\n5+) A lot of the other rooms were small fights, small traps, or rooms containing treasure. There was a puzzle involving opening a door by covering it in blood and whatever's blood you use come out to kill you, but they opted to pass on it. Also, I had them walk in one room and the old man told them there was an elephant in the room, the pcs addressed the elephant in the room and it disappeared as the old man realized that was crazy and he must be remembering it wrong.\n\n**Boss room**) Right before this room there were hundreds of magical items that Phein had gathered or made, and they all decided to load up on them, they were surprised I let them have so much, they seem to have forgotten that this was a memory (I let everyone have one magic item when they came out of the memory stating the old man's magic was just powerful enough to bring that many items from his memories to the real world.) Good thing they did take so many however because taking any of Pheins treasures will make him fight them, and since they had all these magic items it was an awesome fight. So, since I like drama, I decided everyone could die once during this and end up back at the entrance of the tower (Magic memory magics). The fight consisted of four brain washed treasure hunters Phein captured and Phein himself. When the player entered Phein said \"**You do not have the power to wield my creations, you shall all perish by my hands and I will recover my items of power**\" Our monk ended up getting chopped in half and everyone thought their friend was dead. Without the other Pcs knowing the monk woke up at the entrance, but like I said they didn't map the tower. so when he died he was out of combat for 3 rounds trying to find his way back, but since the room rotated the doorway was blocked. Que UMD checks to try and break down the wall with a ring he had. It worked and he busting a fist sized hole in the wall. Their NPC is in great danger only having a few HP left so the monk thinks it's a great idea to stick his magical boomerang inside the hole and try to use it's power. If he hits 2 people with it they will switch places, he hit's himself and just as he throws it to the NPC, the rotating room that he now has his arm in rotates breaking off his arm but his sacrifice was worth is as he hit the girl NPC and saved her life. Now, our other party members notice that he is back alive, missing an arm, he has swapped places with the near dead npc, and are confused to no end. The fight goes on and a few more deaths happen and they piece together what happened to the monk as well as them killing the four other treasure hunters. The boss fight is nearly over, only one person is alive right outside the room looking through the fist sized hole the monk punched and Phein thinks the fight is basically over and he is grabbing his magic items the players took. The one alive player is a ranger and has an auto hit arrow, useable once per encounter and he decides to use it right here, though the hole, he is also using Pheins bow he stole. He draws his bow says \"**This is my bow bitch**\" and kills the boss with a headshot and a max damage roll.\n\nThey find the item the old man lost and they come out of his memories. It's a locket, with a picture of his beloved wife who had died many years ago, and in his senile age he had forgotten about her. He lost the locket there when he was there in his younger years and it was his only memento he had of her, everything else was lost to the ocean when his old home collapsed into it...along with his wife.

        "text": "Hefting the maul in my hand I walked back down the hallway, pointedly ignoring my mothers room. After a quick check through the other rooms revealed nothing except a few more roaches, I opened the sliding glass door to the back patio and stepped out. Standing at the edge of the patio was a shadowy figure, a figure literally composed of shadow, staring directly at me. Without pausing to wonder at what I was looking at I let loose a high-pitched yell and swung the heavy maul at the figure awkwardly, muscles unused to activity responding slowly, and it sidestepped my pitiful swing easily and swiped at my arm in passing.\n\nWhatever it was made of was sharp and three deep gouges in my arm began immediately fountaining blood and shrieking pain signals to my brain. Stumbling badly and falling bodily to the ground from the failed swing I let go of the maul and jumped back to my feet, realizing I was more likely to hurt myself than anything else by using it. While the thing made a noise like bubbling tar that I took for laughter I looked behind it into my dining room where the fire was spreading quickly and made my decision. Lurching into motion I charged at the thing with my arms spread wide and I saw something like surprise in its stance before I caught it up and brought both of us crashing through the glass door and onto the dining room table.\n\nThe table shuddered and collapsed underneath us, throwing me off of the thing to land a few feet away. Sore and slightly woozy from blood loss I flopped up against the cabinet and stared blearily at the thing approaching me, realizing that everything I had done hadn't phased the creature in the slightest. Despair washed over me and for a moment I considered just letting it kill me, until I looked over to the still open microwave and remembered what it had done.\n\nGiving myself up for dead I decided I would die screaming defiance at this murderous shade and I got to my feet once again, grabbing a kitchen knife and setting my face grimly. About to begin my last assault I paused when I heard something so incongruous that it snapped me out of my dazed state.\n\n\"Knock knock!\" someone shouted before my front door exploded inwards, and through the wrecked door stepped someone I had never seen before. He stood over six feet tall and had a neon pink mohawk stretching another foot above that. Grinning happily he leveled a shotgun at the shadow-creature and with an explosion of sound blasted a hole through its torso. The shade shrieked and dove out through the broken glass door to the patio and disappeared into the night.\n\nNumb fingers dropped my knife and I stared blankly at my savior for several long moments. \"Holy shit dude you got fucked up. Sorry I didn't get here sooner we just got the alarm a few minutes ago. We should probably leave.\" Smiling at me again, pink mohawk turned around and sauntered back out the front door with me stumbling behind him. \n\nA black Jeep was parked on the front lawn with the drivers side door hanging ajar. Pink mohawk slid into the car and gestured at me to hop into the passenger seat, I did and mumbled an apology for getting blood all over his upholstery which he waved away, saying that there had been far worse things soaking into his seats. We stayed in park for a few minutes and watched the flames begin to consume my house. \"You should smoke a cigarette.\" Pink mohawk said, \"It'll give you something you can control and something to focus on. Helps when shit like this happens. Name's Thrash by the way, nice to meet you.\" I shook his hand, giving my name, and then shakily brought a cigarette to my lips and lit it, smoking while my life burned down.\n\nWhen the flames had fully taken hold of the house, Thrash reversed back onto the street and drove away, avoiding conversation by way of blaringly loud punk-rock. We drove at a rapid clip through the streets of the town I had lived for a few minutes before Thrash cranked the wheel hard to the left and we shot off the road and into a tunnel I had never seen before. By the time I had begun to react to his sudden, apparently suicidal, turn we were out of the tunnel and pulling up to a small, homey looking cabin in a clearing of pine trees.\n\nThrash pulled up in front of the cabin and turned the car off, silencing the music and leaving just my panicked breathing to fill the silence. \"Hey dude, chill out it's not like that was the scariest thing you've seen tonight. Let's go inside and get you some pants and introductions.\"\n\nHaving had enough time to calm down from the near-constant adrenaline rush of the past fifteen minutes I stepped out of the car and immediately passed out. Waking up sometime later I looked around and saw that I was in what looked like an amalgam of a doctors office, a surgical suite, and mechanics shop. I sat up, immediately regretted that decision, and groaned unhappily while the world twirled around me. A face came into view and smiled down at me, \"Glad you're awake. Please drink this.\" the unknown man placed a straw between my lips and squeezed a large quantity of some citrusy liquid into my mouth. I swallowed reflexively and immediately felt my body break out into pins and needles. After a few seconds the uncomfortable sensation left me feeling refreshed and energetic, I sat up again and looked over at the new guy, who nodded at me and then turned around and left through the only visible door. Hopping off the table I put on the clothes sitting nearby and walked out through the same door as the new guy. I found myself in a sparsely decorated living room and saw the new guy sitting in front of about eight computer monitors, when he heard the door opening he turned around and looked at me again. \"Hello, my name in Brain. Welcome to Monster Squad.\"",

I put effort into that, damnit!*\n\nNow, there's something very, very important I mentioned  about Svetlana in the linked post. Go and read it.\n\nBack, deep beneath the bowels of Red Hall, Kizmet and Ianya easily slay the soldier/demon/things. That done, Kizmet stuffs a sack full of Red apples, licked with a faint golden glow. He dumps Dural Suratal's skin (which, asides from the vast about of damage around the legs, with the knees in particular, is completely and utterly in one piece) in a sack. Ianya removes the remaining apple from Andarta's mouth, and prepares to carry her.\n\nAll done, they sprint past the moderately prolonged death of Dural (still ongoing, and to be described in an addendum) Suratal, and hurriedly return to the surface, and the front gate.\n\nThe argument is *still* ongoing, of course, and Cassapin looks close to throwing a hissy fit because he hasn't won yet.\n\nHis day is not made better when Ianya and Kizmet turn up and hand the Apples to Svetlana, around which they *shine* with pure, golden light.\n\nSvetlana eats one (after the priests have inspected them), and does not die. In fact her wounds are healed, and her touch is able to rouse Andarta back to consciousness.\n\nMuch Hilarity was had when Ianya asks Andarta \"Can I put you down now?\" and the GM takes it in an *entirely* different way.\n\nNow Cassapin *does* throw a hissy fit. Not the usual, *I will destroy/insult/yell at you* kind of hissy fit. No no, those would be beneath his dignity. Instead, he gives us Roren.\n\nLet me repeat that: He gives us *Roren*. Not the city we currently find ourselves in, but the former Kingdom. Sure, it's only so he can brutally murder us on the field of battle, but hey ho. He asks for two days to allow his troops to leave, which he is given by the Lord of the City (much facepalming was had.)\n\nThe Commoners proceeded to get incredibly drunk, the Nobles agree to meet tomorrow at noon, Svetlana attempts to calm down Cal Thurr, formerly our greatest alley, and now rather annoyed because he believes that Svetlana has been angling for the throne *the entire time* (as far as I can tell, perfectly true.) Also betrayed his trust by not telling him, endangering his family by being around them, even as they sheltered us whilst we were wanted criminals nadda nadda yadda. Political bullshit.\n\nKizmet spends some hours talking with the Duke identified as the Loyalist, convincing him to come to the meeting tomorrow at Noon. He's not entirely a Loyalist: He acknowledges that Cassapin is a fucking prick, but has decided, for now, that his oaths are the stronger bond, and that even if Cassipin is a terrible ruler, after him will come his children, who may be better etc. etc. Essentially the very long view. Perfectly understandable, and *entirely frustrating* for that reason.\n\nThe next morning, Kizmet takes a little walk to the Lord of the City's estate, Ianya in tow because she has nothing else to do. The first order of business is convincing them to move, as soon as possible, to Red Hall, for reasons of security. They agree quickly, as on the matter of war, we're the rather more experienced lot: She's a traditional lady, and he's know as an academic and an enchanter.\n\nAbout him being an enchanter. In this universe, enchanting is made much, much easier using a substance called Moonsilver. It's typically collected using extensive, prolonged ritual at the height of the full moon, and a collection brings a few drops, and every drop is precious. (Every drop is great. If a drop is wasted, Ninnisar gets quite irate...)\n\nWe show him the barrel we have and ask him what he can do with it. '*A lot* is the answer, apparently. Such as turn all of the city's statuary into soldiers on very short notice. Given a bit of time, he could change the border between Roren and Vargo (an in theory line, which likely cuts across several farmer's fields) into a giant chasm, or possibly a mountain range. The Statues idea seems fine for now: Bad things happen when people mess with the environment on that scale. (Remind me to regale you with how we *got* that much Moonsilver in the first place some time.)\n\nWe arrive to the meeting fashionably late, noting that, whilst one of the Dukes (the one called out by the Loyalist yesterday) is absent, a few of his vassals remain, acting under orders to keep his Lord's options open.\n\nThey enter the room to see a banner raised at each end: At one end, the Banner of Roren, and at the other the Banner of Vargo.\n\nBy this point, Svetlana has gained her Cohort, as allowed by her leadership: A priest, following the same Goddess which she's a Paladin of (who also happens to be the National Deity of Roren...) He was locked up by Cassapin for asking, very loudly, to see the tree. He is now released, has a two axe, a sworn loyalty to Svetlana (due to her Religious-Political status) and a russet red beard. The two handed axe is a bit of an annoyance, because Svetlana has a magically enchanted banner (+2 to attack/damage/saving throws for those fighting 'under it' in line of sight) and he can't us eboth at once, but we dig the rest.\n\nSvetlana won't become Queen, not here. The Nationalists are split into two camps: One under Cal Thurr, due to his military experience, and the other under the Del Morral family, due to their hosting of ambassadors of both Soroster (the country to the south Vargo is at war with) and Dragonholme (who are across the sea, far to the East, and integral to much of our earlier adventures. Please see [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1xm4bh/pathfinder_in_the_depths_of_the_formian_hive/) and [there](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/1zuk4n/pathfinder_the_fateless_campaign_the_escape/) for a little more information on them.\n\nIt's a deadlock, and seeing that no-one will vote her Queen *now*, convinces them to defer the election of the ~~Queen~~ Monarch until the fight is won, rallying them behind Cal Thurr (who, Ianya continuously points out for her own amusement, Svetlana will likely have to marry) as a General, in order to ensure our continued survival.\n\nBut never mind that.\n\nIn talking with the Loyalist, Kizmet teases out that the Loyalist would be much more inclined to abandon Cassapin if the party could prove he had ever broken a swore oath.\n\nIanya excuses herself, and goes off in Raven form to raid the castle. Again.\n\nHer Survival and Stealth and high enough that see finds Cassapin's offices fairly quickly: After all, shackled to the ground like most, he'd put it up high, out of reach (usually.)\n\nHer first search doesn't reveal anything that she needs. She decides to stay longer, as the guards outside and behind deaf today.\n\nShe finds a lockbox, concealed well (but not well enough) that zaps her when she picks it up. Three times. Bringing her down to 10hp. After passing all of the reflex saving throws for half damage. The guards still don't hear it.\n\nNow, from here there are a number of interesting What-ifs, given that the Lockbox is too large to fit in Ianya's pockets and still Polymorph.\n\n* What if Ianya had a bag of holding, or borrowed Kizmet's? (Answer: she gets away with the Lockbox)\n* What if Ianya had abandoned the the quest, or returned later with Kizmet (Answer: I dunno)\n* What if Ianya simply hacked the box open with her axe? (Answer: Answer, I dunno)\n* What if Pathfinder had an integral fate point mechanic? (Answer: Ianya likely gets away with the Lockbox)\n* What if Ianay had remembered she had five Potions of Cure Moderate Wounds (for 2d8+4 hit points) and drunk a few of them? (Answer: Ianya likely gets away with the Lockbox)\n* What if Ianya, when attempting to take her running jump out of the window, in order to gain enough horizontal momentum to allow the ring of Feather Fall to carry over the walls, *didn't roll a* **1**? (Answer: My Jimmies aren't rustled, and Ianya likely gets away with the Lockbox)\n\nSo, Ianya takes a flying leap out the window... And catches her foot on the ledge, and begins tumbling down. Thinking quickly, she thrusts the lockbox downwards and polymorphs. The lockbox smashes against the ground, bursting opening, revealing five ruby-like stones with a malevolent glow, and a stone of some sort, with the carving of a chain around it. Ianya goes for the stone.\n\nUnfortunately, the people training in the fucking courtyard and have been forewarned for this sort of thing. And they had Crossbows.\n\nSix shots, two hits, 2d10 damage, rolling 9 and 7 for one unconscious Ianya.\n\nAnd that's why Pathfinder needs Fate Points.\n\nOf course, rescuing Ianya is down to Kizmet. He gets in easy. Getting out is a little harder, but Ianya's feeling a little better with 4d8+8 healing in the form of two cure moderate wound potions. Kizmet left the two guards outside Ianya's cell intact for now. But they plan to change that. Kizmet goes for the stealth sap on the right, Ianya goes for the grapple to keep the other silent until Kizmet can whack him.\n\nBecause fuck Ianya today, Ianya rolls too low, and the Hue and cry is raised.\n\nThey both move quickly, Ianya insisting on recovering at least the more expensive parts of her gear before they vanish (She had quite a bit on money on her, and she refuses to have her fortune fill Vargo's coffers.)\n\nIanya scoops up a Guard's Crossbow, and takes a bolt herself (Ianya is starting to detest crossbows) before they make it up the stairs to the level just outside the exit to the dungeons, which contains, off to the side, the locked room where Ianya's stuff is stored.\n\nIn order to buy them time, Ianya summons a Backup Pony, on the stairs. It's job is to prevent people coming up the stairs.\n\nKizmet picks the lock in short order. Remember he's a Acrobat. No Trapfinding. And he didn't see the trap.\n\nKizmet gets standard actions only for four rounds, because fuck traps, that's why, and because he should be asleep but he passed his endurance saves and Ianya is yelling at him enough to keep him awake.\n\nOn yeah, they've also got 8 rounds before they're screwed.\n\nIanya is allowed to grab two of her items per rounds.\n\nKizmet does quite the job of keeping the guards occupied. At first it's the Pony doing it, although it dies quickly. First Caltrops, Then the Helm of Blasting (6d6 sonic damage in 30 foot cone, once per day without risk of head exploding)  mushes up three of them, and leaves the other three  (who saved for half damage) on 2 health each. An intimidate check sends two running. By this point, four rounds is up, and Kizmet gets his boots of haste on.\n\nPoor bastard, but not quite yet. He, somehow, goes first in the initiative order, and sticks a his blade in Kizmet.\n\nBy this point, Ianya has her bow back, and Ianya is ranged DPS. Poof, dead.\n\nIanya and Kizmet loot the room.\n\nThey make off with:\n\n**Ianya's stuff**\n\n* Her +2 chain shirt\n* Her +2 longbow with +1d6 cold damage\n* Her Cloak, with gives her +1AC, 10ft flight for 3 rounds a day (which I forgot about,) can't be lost by Ianya, and if someone who isn't her is holding it (eg: Took it from her) they gain 1 geas/day over her. We are all very glad Dural is dead, because he was magically competent, and would have returned Ianya to the party under Geas.\n* Her Bracers of the Falcon\n* The Harp of the One True Chord, which align's the party's weapons to good (Eg: The magical item that killed Dural Suratal)\n* Her magic map, which transfers the knowledge of it's holders onto it automatically.\n* All of her money!\n\n**Other stuff**\n\n* A glowing amulet of Vargo's national god\n* a scythe with a black, ominous blade. (Praise be the bag of holding!)\n\nAnd, best of all, after Ianya, having grabbed her stuff and polymorphed the hell outta dodge, Kizmet bears witness to\n\n**Cassapin's hissy fit, as he chews the scenary with such gems as: 'I knew I should have killed her!'**\n\nAlthough I left behind my magic token which turns into a horse on command behind.\n\nBalls.",

Only 2-3 more stories after this!  edit: I lied, this is the penultimate story.\n-- --\n\nJalees sat in his haven, awaiting the call. After the fiasco last night of the Camarilla coming after one of the Sabbat safe houses in the city, he had put the word out to his handlers that something needed to be done. He did not know the source of information that had leaked the details to the Brujah, though he was told it had been fixed. He did not question it further.\n\nHe felt the magic of the ritual seeping into the room around him just before it began. He waited, and he heard his handler speaking in his ear. They had a short conversation on the specifics of the night’s escapade, and then cut the connection - any longer and any other thaumaturge may have inadvertently found the ‘signal’ and investigated. That would not end well.\n\nJalees made his way to Elysium, and spoke privately with the Prince before the masses arrived. He passed on the information about another Sabbat haven that should be slightly less hazardous than the previous night’s, and that he would bring it up to the general assembly when cued.\n\nThe Domain was still suffering, and the Primogen Council had not yet approved a mass Embrace to restore the numbers. There were maybe 60 Fangs in the place, about a third as many as when Jalees had arrived. Around 50 had shown up, and the PCs walked in unusually late. Jalees didn’t know what they had been up to, but it could not have been anything good.\n\nBrujah and Ventrue were still suffering many of their wounds and it showed in their step - not the pain, per se, but the debilitation that had resulted from the wounds. They made it a point to stop by Jalees and thank him for “pulling [their] asses out of the fire”. Jalees smiled and replied “everyone needs help now and then.”\n\nThe Prince came to the podium and addressed the crowd with a heartfelt and moving, though perhaps not as morale-boosting as intended, speech regarding the clearing of the Sabbat haven and how well it went. Jalees then relayed the new target to the Domain as a whole, indicating that he had personally scouted the site following the previous night’s engagement, and rated it as a low threat level in terms of traps and possible resistance. Jalees had gotten word that tonight the haven was to be used for a Sabbat ritual, and that most, if not all, of the Sabbat in the city would be there. “We could not ask for a better opportunity to strike.”\n\nWhich was completely true, as of the previous night. The haven was to be used for the Sabbat mass Vaulderie tonight, and that all of the Sabbat in the city, minus him, would show to participate. Jalees also knew that by the time the strike team arrived the haven would be heavily fortified against direct assault, new and improved traps would have been laid, and that the ritual had actually been moved to another haven in the city.\n\nThe Prince came forward again, calling on all those willing to step up and take action. He recommended that Ventrue and Brujah lead the strike again: “With a bit more knowledge under their belt, the Sabbat could not possibly survive.” The Prince then said he needed to impose on the Primogen Council, and called an immediate meeting to resolve outstanding issues. Jalees paused to dump a bit more (mostly correct) background onto Ventrue and Brujah, reminded them that things may have changed since the previous night, then followed the rest of the Council into the meeting chambers.\n\nWhen the strike team returned, their numbers had dwindled - only four of the ten had returned. Ventrue, Brujah, Tremere and Regent were the only ones to survive the Sabbat “Fun House”. All of them were about a good slap from falling into torpor, and none of them had the energy to tell the story alone, so they took it in turns:\n\nVentrue started - The strike team had arrived to the location via several different methods, mostly two per vehicle, but some went on foot or some other method. Once the entire party had arrived, Tremere and Regent were sent in Astrally (Aus:5) to look around and see what was going on. They met with limited success - everything past the first two rooms was warded against spirits with extra strength. The team decided to move in anyways, and just take it slow.\n\nBrujah continued as Ventrue lost steam - The strike team proceeded into the building, taking each room painstakingly slowly. Tremere and Regent thoroughly inspected each room before moving forward, checking for traps before declaring all clear and having the rest follow in. They managed to find four out of every five traps or so, but the ones they hadn’t found were ingenious *and* deadly.\n\nTremere picked up - Everything was going alright until the fifth room, where the first big trap sprung. After disabling a bank of claymores and getting everyone into the room, jets of two-part polyurethane sealing foam ( Think [Great Stuff](http://greatstuff.dow.com/) but commercial grade, usually as a fire extinguishing flood system ) dropped from the cieling and kicked on. “The whole room filled within seconds, and it cured hard about as fast!” This stuff, however, was not fire-proof - it was actually highly flammable, a fantastic fuel for a raging fire. The three vamps that entered last couldn’t punch through the hard foam in time to get out.\n\nVentrue had built up a bit of energy again - The next big trap was set up similarly, a somewhat easy to find bank of explosives which belied the more difficult pit traps further on. Which were both complete distractions from the four .50 caliber belt fed [GAU-19](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GAU-19) gatling cannon sliding silently out of the walls. Controlled by an array of motion sensors, each picked a target and opened up, 2,000 rounds per minute sailed through the air and most hit their target. Brujah survived by the skin of his teeth, but the other three ashed instantly. It took a few moments for the others to destroy the guns.\n\nBrujah cut in - They finally made it to the last room, the four of them that were left, and it was there that the greatest trap of all lay in wait. One member of the Sabbat was standing in the room, reading a book. As they entered, he closed the book and bid them good evening - and activated the Ward against Kindred that they had just stepped over. They were trapped, and the Sabbat fled after a few moments of gloating - the group could not build up enough tolerance to step over the circle and chase him.\n\nTremere finished the story - Only the combined efforts of himself and Regent were able to deconstruct how the ward had been set up and dispel it. The Sabbat had woven nine concentric wards into a single compound circle, something that neither Tremere nor Regent had ever seen or heard of before. Following that, they took the time to search for the exit, then got back to Elysium with as much haste as they could muster.\n\nJalees did not speak, he just looked away, and motioned for nourishment. The four got topped up, rested for a bit, then retired to their respective havens. Regent went back to the Chantry, where Jalees was waiting for him. They went inside to a quiet room, and Jalees did his best to get a better account of the action out of his mind directly. Everything checked out, story was accurate. Regent had outlived his use, and Jalees made the effort to take as much as he could before leaving. Regent wasn’t appreciative of Jalees’ gift, but Regent couldn’t really be bothered by much of anything anymore. Jalees made the magical 7th generation, gained enough XP to put it to good use, and signalled his handler that he was ready for the third phase.\n\n* [next&gt;&gt;](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2ikwve/vampiretm_john_randoms_revenge_conclusion/)",

        "text": "I woke up blearily and looked over at my alarm clock, wondering what time it was. There had apparently been a power outage because it was blinking 3:33 and I couldn't hear the TV out in the living room.\n\nDeciding to have a cigarette before going back to bed I shoved my feet into my boots and threw on my coat to shuffle out to the back porch. Walking down the dark hallway I heard my boots squishing through something and stopped to swear softly, my dog must have shit in the hall.\n\nSince the mess wasn't going to get any smaller by itself I changed my route and headed into the kitchen to grab some paper towels and cleaner, when I flicked the switch to turn the light on nothing happened and I swore again at the cheap bulbs we bought. I pulled out my phone and used the light from the screen to get a vague idea of where I was standing and grabbed the paper towels. Being irritable I decided to wake my bother up and make him switch out the bulb while I cleaned up the dog shit and stomped over to the couch where he had passed out watching the tv. \n\n\"Hey dude, wake up. Shit's broke and fatty crapped in the hall.\"\nI leaned down with the blue light of my phone and reached over to shake him awake but stopped, not understanding what I was seeing. There was a cockroach the size of an infant child sitting on his chest and chewing away steadily at what was once my brothers head. With a shriek I reached down and grabbed the roach, throwing it to the ground and stomping on it in a panicked staccato. Losing the war with my stomach I spewed over its remains when the smell of raw meat hit my nose. Hyperventilating I sprinted back down the hallway, slipping a bit on what I was not sure was shit any more, and shouldered open the door to my moms room. \"Mom!\" I shrieked while leaping onto the bed, in my panic reverting back to the six-year-old \nin me that thought my parents could solve anything. My panicked jump landed me in the middle of another group of monstrous roaches scuttling around a mound of shredded meat. \"Mom?\" I squeaked, with my mind rejecting what it was seeing, refusing to accept that she was dead. I sat there stunned for several seconds before feeling a sharp stab from one of the roaches biting into my thigh.\n\nI blacked out for a bit then, and when I came to my lower half was coated in ichor and blood. \"burn it down, burn it down, burn these fucking things down.\" I mumbled repeatedly to myself while I stumbled out to the garage. I grabbed the lawn mower and the gas can and dragged them back into the house.\n\nLifting the lawn mower up to the kitchen counter I slashed open its gas tank, letting the pungent fluid flow across the counter-top and drip on the linoleum. I turned on all of the burners of the stovetop and tossed some washcloths onto the flames, letting them start to smoke and burn. I grabbed all the forks and the gas can and opened the microwave to start another fire there and then stared numbly at\nthe mutilated remains of my dog. Tears streaming down my face I poured some gasoline on the microwave and then left a trail of it behind me while I walked back to my moms bed. I emptied the rest of the gas onto her bed and started it burning with my lighter.\n\nAs I turned to leave a thought struck me and turned my numbed state into a seething rage that started me shaking. Cockroaches couldn't have put my dog in the microwave, something else had done that, and since I was still breathing it might still be in the house. \n\nWith the heat of my mothers pyre licking at my back I stomped into my room and grabbed the splitting maul I had bought the summer before with the intention of using it to break up the logs in our back-yard for firewood. It had languished next to my bed since then but it intended to use it now.\n\nThere I stood, wearing just boxers boots and a long coat, ten pound maul in hand, the pasty skin of my pendulous gut gleaming in the moonlight, and the blood of my family coating my legs. I knew I was going to die soon but I intended to do some damage on my way down. ",

        "text": "https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bwsr0_kEk2VbZG5OVmVWU3dpLTg/edit?usp=sharing\n\nThis is it.  We knew it going into the session that this was the final run of our short campaign, so we pulled out all the stops.  Elliot spent some time and money repairing his new deck and his old deck, Hotentote communed with the ancient spirits or whatever the hell shamans do.  Crumples went hunting grenades and grenade accessories, and I looked at my character sheet and shrugged.  I had my suit, I had my crowbar, I was a troll.  Done.\n\nI can’t believe I forgot to tell this part, but we sold our souls to get Elliot his new deck.  His old one got fried in one of our previous runs, and we called in a favor from Mr. Rico, who just _handed_  Elliot an upgrade - a 100,000 nuyen plus upgrade.  \n\nAnd now the time had come to repay the favor.  Mr. Rico had lost contact with a few talismongers of his acquaintance,  and was concerned. We were to find out what had happened,  and get the talismongers back, alive if possible. \n\nWell, ok. \n\nInvestigation not being our strong suit, we go to the address of the first talismonger on the list. This worthy was set up in downtown,  and had a fairly good security system, which was intact and unbreached. We nosed around and Hotentote sniffed the aether. \n\nNothing probative.  The magisphere was flippy, bouncing between angry and happy.  This didn't make sense to any of us, so we proceeded to the next place on the list.  This place was on the edge of the Barrens, and didn't have the physical security or astral security of the first, so...\n\nThe autopicker didn't fare well against the door, so crowbar was the name of the game. \n\nAnd the warded lock blew me flat in a shower of crackling electricity.  I overflowed on stun damage and went down hard, barely avoiding physical damage.  Between chems and magic,  the boys manage to get me back on my feet.\n\nThe door is open, though.  In we go, and our sniffy sniffers are sniffing.  The inside of the shop isn't as formidable,  but it's high grade creepy.  We avoid touching anything that isn't relevant, and find a terminal.\n\nElliot does his thing, and the machine gives up the ghost, spreading it's stubby little digital legs for him.  He finds a list of contacts and we pull it, and an appointment at a bar that Hotentote is familiar with. We mull over the contacts and compare them to Mr. Rico's list, and find several matches on our way there.  \n\nThe bar is a dive, a dump, a plastic lid away from being a dumpster.  The bartender is bored and surly, but Crumples manages to cross his palm with coin of silver correctly, and we get access to the meet room.  Hotentote hits the Astral and checks the place out, and finds traces of a stun job - someone who was very briefly surprised and in pain, then unconscious. \n\nBack to the bartender for the who.  Crumples does his thing again, and we get five minutes access to the place’s horrible, old, worn out camera.  Instead of dicking around with searching the contents of it, we copy the entire day off and get out of there. \n\n\nThe manasphere is worse, fluttering around and giving Hotentote a headache.  The sky is swirling,  but we can't make out any sort of focal point or target. We drive aimlessly downtown, back to the first shop as Elliot and Crumples sniff through the footage.  Elliot starts making sputtering noises and we start paying attention.  It’s Kigami.  The girl from the concert,  who thought magic was cool and beers brought by strange men were ok to drink.  She apparently met one of Mr. Rico’s talismongers there, and he got the shock glove treatment from an invisible gentleman, and escorted out of the premises with her. \n\nWell that’s interesting.  Crumples calls her, and she doesn’t have any idea whatsoever what we’re talking about.  \n\nSure, lady.  Sure.\n\nWe make our way back to the first shop and kick the door in. The warding here is a screamer,  so we just ignore it long enough to fold the terminal in half and scarper before Knight Errant shows up.\n\nOr try to. We get out, but between the front door and the car is a trio of gangers, and they challenge us.  To a dance off.\n\nSirens in the distance mean we don't have time for this shit, so I interrupt her spiel with a crowbar strike. Hotentote tries to help, but he's hurting so bad he can't cast. The leader manages to dodge, and we steamroll past them to the car and escape. \n\nThe list of contacts we get here matches most of the Barrens list, and most of Mr. Rico's.  But there's one exception.  Kigami.  She’s the odd duck out on the lists.  Most of the others are recognizable as strong mid-level practicioners, but she’s just..  a nobody.\n\nHotentote is bleeding from the nose and the greater manasphere is spasming. The sky is rolling now, and it's pronounced enough that we can make out a rough direction towards the epicenter.  Things are getting weird on the street, there's a gun duel with guitars, a full dress dance fight, all sorts of bizarre things.  \n\nWe make it to a park with a good view of the sky and manage to figure out where it’s centered.  It’s practically a tornado at this point - a full blown mana storm.  It’s our only lead, and the bouncing manasphere almost has to be related to missing talismongers.  We can’t communicate except by singing, which almost causes us to cap each other, but we persevere, and get back on the road. \n\nThe epicenter is an abandoned pizza joint on the edge of the barrens.  Children used to drag their parents here…   to listen to horrible music performed by animatronic cartoon characters, crude drones in funny costumes.\n\nOut of character, I couldn’t help but feel a little sad.  Five Nights at Freddys is too new, too current, too relevant.  But something was off.  The mana storm didn’t figure into a badly handled FNaF clone… \n\nThe storm is worsening, and Hotentote can’t stop screaming.  I panic, since for some stupid reason he’s the one driving - and he drives straight into the building.  The valiant stolen Americar crashes through the boarded-up plate glass front, and all is silent. \n\nLiterally all is silent.  We’re in the epicenter of the storm, and nothing outside appears to exist anymore.  Hotentote is wheezing and gasping as he recovers, since the local manasphere is calm, though tense with anticipation.\n\nI peel Crumbles and Elliot out of the ex-ride and we kit up.  Full tilt boogy, nothing left behind.  That means underbarrel shotgun on Crumples’ shiny new XM30, Krime Spree and riot shield with Hotentote, body armor and helmet on Elliot, and I swapped out my dapper hat for a helmet. \n\nElliot hacked the building’s local net, which almost killed him.  According to him, it was “unhappy”, but he managed to pull the intruder tracking livefeed from the building’s security system, and put it on our various AR displays. \n\nIt showed us.  And four others. \n\nWe formed up in a staggered line, Hotentote leading the way, Crumples tucked in behind him, Elliot trailing them and myself backing the party and slightly offset to keep my line of attack open.  \n\nHotentote takes us through the hallway after the first of the others, which the building system insisted was a ‘friendly’.  The thing came straight for us as soon as we got near, and we managed to meet it at a corner. \n\nWith the AR feed from the building it was simplicity itself for Hotentote to meet its charge around the corner with his riot shield, and a charge of the electroshock function of the shield sends the drone crumpling into the corner, its systems completely bounced.  It’s a gaudy man-sized duck shell on a combat drone, its tattered padding and decorations giving it a ‘mechanical undead’ look.  The sword arms are still sharp though.  We move on, Hotentote and Crumples hearing a creepy sound from deeper in the building.  \n\nWe find the chanting, and it’s not a good thing.  There’s a massive ritual circle on the floor, with a dozen talismongers from Mr. Rico’s list standing stations around it chanting.\n\nAnd Kigami.  The stupid girl is dressed in flowing white robes like a priestess from a bad trid.  I start working my way around the circle, knocking fools out and getting my troll on, while Hotentote tries to figure out what it’s doing and Crumples and Elliot open fire on the circle itself, attempting to shatter it’s physical structure.  \n\nWe’re too late.  The damn thing flares a harsh red light, and all the chanters - and Kigami fall into it, disappearing into an elsewhere.  The light is blocked by something massive, and a four meter teddy bear climbs out of the circle.  The bear stands on the hard light and smiles happily at us.  It starts to try and glad-hand us, talking about fun and happy times forever.\n\nHotentote flips his shit and calls the bear out.  \n\nOh.  It’s actually the Adversary.\n\nOh.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Devil Himself tries to threaten us into submission, but we’re not having it.  Hotentote signals for a fastball special and charges up his death punch.  I wind up and blast him fist-first into the bear’s face, splattering tufts of stuffing and fake fur everywhere.  Hotentote manages to land gracefully and rejoins us as The Adversary laughs, and Elliot and Crumples open fire.  Full auto bursts, grenades, shotgun rounds, and The Adversary is mocking us.  \n\nI fling Hotentote again and actually hurt the bastard, but we can’t keep that up for long.  He’s winded and puffing from flinging that much mana around, not looking too good. \n\nElliot says he’s gonna go blow the building, but I notice something in the speech patterns of the Adversary.  A quick consult with the others… \n\nAnd I challenge him to a rock off.\n\n\nRest in comments. \n\n\n",

        "text": "I picked up Total War: Medieval II a couple weeks ago when it went on sale for .99 cents. Anyway, I played my first campaign on medium as England, since you start the tutorial as the Normans conquering England. After I take care of some brigands in York and Nottingham, I take three rebel cities, two on the continent and the other rebel on mainland england, and start developing my economy. As Rennes and my other city on the continent start to grow, I start building my army to take out France, one of the victory conditions (Eliminate France, Scotland, and hold 15 cities). \n\nI've been doing all my fighting with Prince Rufus, son of William the Conquer. His dread is extremely high since he's been executing everyone so far, since the AI doesn't like to ransom. I decide to take care of France first since they're bigger and most of my forces are already there. I send out spies to Paris and Angers so they can open the gates. I take Angers at a fairly low cost and then start making my way to Paris. France was probably getting ready to go to war with me too, since his armies were very close. \n\nMy assassins took out their commanders pretty quickly, but i slowed down once I saw the advanced units Angers could produce. I waited in some forest on the border of french territory near Paris. My army was full and I was just reinforcing it and changing out my more advanced units. Also, William died and Rufus became king while I was waiting. I didn't want my king to die, but his command was extremely high, so he stayed. Eventually an army challenged me.\n\nKeep in mind I was fairly new to the game. Some other French armies marched near me at the same time, but I didn't really think about it. I looked at the battle report. My troops were around a thousand strong, somewhere between 975 and 1050, fairly advanced troops, some cavalry, and some artillery. Ok, sounds pretty good. The French have no Generals, just captains, the main army 221 strong with reinforcements of around 230. But, the battle estimated 85% in France's favor. Being my first campaign, i thought I must have been missing some technology factor, or some huge slant toward gunpowder units i must have missed and not been able to get. I was pretty sure 1000 men, at least 200 being cavlary, I could charge them before they get many volleys off.\n\nIn game, I imagine the king's advisers and scouts looking at him in awe as the brave king set off to battle, cocky, commanding. Some inspired, some shitting their pants. The battle loaded and my setup zone was on a hill with some scattered trees, a pretty good start. I put my light cavalry up front and a set on each of my flanks, so they can scout around at the reinforcements. My infantry formations were set up aggressively so I could make the battle quick.\n\nI start the battle and to my surprise, 2 reinforcement markers show up on my screen. Umm, ok that's weird. One, starts to my left, behind the main force to my front, the other was on my right side, a little behind me. That's never good, but I thought it would be ok. I start scouting, but the reinforcements are pretty far out. after a little bit, my light cavalry reaches the force on my right. The force is about a thousand strong. thinking back, I realize what happened. I must have forgot to scroll down on the report. No way was i experienced enough to take that on, but I went ahead anyway.\n\nIt started off ok, doing pretty good against the nearest army, but then i tried to shift my formation so I could defend against the big ass army on my flank. This was when the tide turned. The French heavy cavalry came in and decimated some archers and artillery before I could get spear men out to protect them. These cavalry were a stronger kind than mine and killed a large section of my light cavalry before my spears routed them. By now, my army was fully engaged and both forces were destroying me. I'd never have taken the challenge if I'd have known the other army was there already.\n\nAnyway, the heavy armored french swords killed most of my spearmen, then the cavalry came in and started killing the routed men. Soon, the Generals bodyguard had broken down and the king was killed and I lost. \n\nThis defeat destroyed the Kingdom. Most of my best units were gone and I had disbanded most of the others before. Also, there was rioting across the kingdom. After playing for maybe 8 or 9 more turns i quit because Scotland declared war and took my two northern cities. France also took all but Caen and I was left with three cities and no income. I said fuck it and quit. Thanks a lot Rufus. \n ",

        "text": "* [&lt;&lt; previous](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2i0y9f/vampiretm_john_randoms_revenge_part_9_medlong/)\n\nThis is the penultimate plot of this gametale series. I still have a lot of little tales here and there, but they’re secondary to Jalees’ overall goal. I bought a couple of things for Jalees since the last tale, but nothing major so I’ll wait on a new sheet until the finale.\n\nIn which the Domain erupts in paranoia so strong it kills vamps\n\nElysium this night was edge-ier than an atom-edged knife in the hands of an emo boy band who plan to use it for group ritual suicide. The Domain had lost half its membership to the Sabbat over the past three weeks, and the Anarch State was down to a total of three members, none of which particularly thought the Camarilla was anything worth protecting. \n\nThe Prince called Elysium to order with a weary shake of his head, opened the floor to anyone who had a suggestion on how to continue to fight the Sabbat. The crowd babbled for a while, then Ventrue and Brujah stepped forward.\n\n&gt;Ventrue: “Prince, We feel that perhaps the best way to begin to drive out the Sabbat is to strike them first.”  \n&gt;Brujah: “I have a location that some of the Sabbat are using as a haven. I think if we can hit them there as the sun is rising, we will have a chance to turn the tide.”  \n&gt;V: “We believe that between ourselves, Malkavian, Tremere, Jack and a few others, we will have an 80% chance of success. We will be able to clear the haven completely, and perhaps lay traps or an ambush for those that would investigate.”  \n&gt;Prince: “All in favor?”  \n\nThe Domain decided that it could work, and should at least be investigated. Jalees recognized the location, and was vaguely surprised that it was solid information. He would have to chastise the coordinator next time they met. He decided that he would go along with this plan. Sometimes the Sabbat must suffer losses, and he could not afford to blow his cover yet. He agreed with the plan, and it was decided that the plan would go into effect the following night, and Elysium ended so the participants could gear up and plan.\n\nThe following night, the group assembled about a five minute walk from the target location, and plotted their assault. Ventrue produced copies of detailed building plans, and talked through the best course of action as far as he could see it. Standard SWAT tactics - two by two movement, each pair clearing rooms after the lead pair passed them, etc. Jalees, being the odd man out, was asked how he would best like to assist the group. Jalees, having yet to show his hand of powerful thauma, decided to continue to keep those cards somewhere inside of his ribcage, and suggested that he could be the point man. I think Ventrue and Brujah almost laughed.\n\nAfter a brief discussion, the players decided that if I wanted to charge into this den of malignant cancer known as Sabbat, they’d let me. Which, overall, was pretty smart of them. I could use the Sabbat body language to warn everyone of an incoming attack, remove myself as a target, and push a majority of my Sabbat brothers out the back door before things got too terrible for them. If only it could have gone so smoothly.\n\nSunrise was nearing, and Jalees' pocket watch chimed softly - the official cue to act. Jalees had already picked the lock, and was waiting to explode through the door. Jalees burned blood for Quicksilver Steps (custom combo discipline Aus/Cel - one blood to add Celerity rating to movement and defense rolls for the round ), kicked in the door, and rushed in. He avoided the claymores surrounding the doorframe, stepped over the tripwire tied to the electrified net on the ceiling, and leaped gracefully across the pit trap lined with punji spikes. When I describe the visual effect, I always liken it to the guy in the Chronicles of Riddick, whose spirit would move before his body did - or if I have a more scientific audience, I tell them that the subject blue-shifts a bit. When you take six movement actions in the space of one, it gets a bit crazy.\n\nVenture and Brujah, have Fortitude and Potence, just strode through it all. They took some damage, but were otherwise able to brush it off. Everyone following did not have to worry about it, as the effects had passed by then. Jalees drew his pistol, activated Silence of Blood (Qui:1), and proceeded into the haven.\n\nThe first few rooms were empty, and Jalees passed them by. The other teams would check them anyways, but he knew where everyone would be by now. They would have barricaded the final fifty feet or so of hallway to the hidden emergency exit, and laid down whatever traps, tricks or zealous brothers they could, and prepared the ambush just beyond that. It was a good plan, one that had worked its way up from a small pack in Phoenix, who had used it to great effect when their haven was attacked by Cam forces. \n\nJalees proceeded ahead of the group, pausing at the corner to look around it quickly and confirm what tactics the Sabbat were using. He flashed some quick hand signals to them, shielding the action with the rest of his body, then fell back a few paces until the rest could catch up. He explained the situation to Ventrue via telepathy, who then quietly updated everyone else on the plan - Venture, Brujah and two of the NPCs would soak bullets as best they could, and everyone else would try to throw as much damage at the Sabbat as possible, and make a decent attempt at catching one alive.\n\nThis did not turn out well for them. Jalees had signalled that Fortitude users were coming in, giving the Sabbat enough time to switch to incendiary rounds, which deal a type of damage that only Fortitude can defend against, cutting the defensive advantage in half ( normally it would be Fortitude + Stamina). When the Sabbat members opened up on the Fortitude wall, they wilted almost instantly. The NPCs ashed before they hit the ground, and both Ventrue and Brujah had to be hauled back by force, and Ventrue was one strong wind away from ash.\n\nThe gunfire died down, magazines hit the floor and reloads happened. Jalees burned more blood, flew down the hallway, and created some loud noises that were almost entirely vampires getting staked. Three relatively low power NPCs were sacrificed for the cause, and the rest fled out the secret exit. He carried them back to the waiting raiding party, and flopped them down on the floor.\n\n&gt;Jalees: “Three bloody scumbloods. All of this for three bloody Sabbat scumbloods.”  \n&gt;Malkavian: “Three in hand is better than twenty in the bush.”  \n&gt;Tremere: “Twenty? What happened to the others?”  \n&gt;M: “An expression, Tremere, nothing more.”  \n&gt;J: “Let us clear the area and get these two into bloodbaths.”  \n\nAnd so Jalees and Malkavian hauled one torpored body each, back out to the waiting box truck that would take them to a safe place. The incident was reported to the Prince, and Jalees took the three Sabbat back to his haven for interrogation - which turned out to be little more than a night of blood and stories before he set them loose again. Brujah and Ventrue should have learned not to underestimate the Sabbat, but they wouldn’t. The next time they came upon the Sabbat, it would not end in their favor.\n\n* [ next &gt;&gt;](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2igoxo/vampiretm_john_randoms_revenge_part_11_long/)",

        "text": "I'm back baby!\n\nThe Party at level 7:\n\n* Ianya, Half Elf Ranger (Beastmaster) Feyblooded due to an encounter with cursed armour, she can Polymorph into a Raven 3 times a day.\n*Andarta, Ianya's animal companion: A Bronze dragon Wyrmling, born with Green Scales.\n* Svetlana, Human Fighter (Archer)/Paladin (4/3)\n* Svetlana's Leadership followers: *N/A*\n* Kizmet, Gnomish Rogue (Acrobat)\n* Kizmet Leadership followers: *N/A*\n* Asuryan, Human Cleric (NPC)\n\nConext: The last several sessions of the campaign have been centered around organising a grand festival in Roren, the former Royal Capital of the former Kingdom of Roren, now Eastern Vargo. Said festival was organised because the Vargan Empire, the new overlords of the seven dukes whose lands comprised the Kingdom of Roren, has taken a turn for the oppressive and racist. Well, more so. They were slavetakers already.\n\nWe're kinda to blame for it. Earlier in our adventures, we ousted a City Guard Captain as a cultmaster, leading a cult fixated on people like our characters: (Fateless. Time's plan has not touched us: Scryers search for our futures and find nothing. Unknownst to almost all, the coming of Fateless is the hearld of Change, Chaos and Ending.) His thing was absorbing the essence of Fateless, in order to enpower himself. As such, he'd been kidnapping and ritually killing Fateless in Stornbridge, one of the Region's major settlements.\n\nWe tangled with his minions (and killed them) and with him (he survived.) We were able to rescue one of his victims, who elected to join the party (A Cleric! A Cleric! Huzzah! Huzzah!)\n\nHaving brought our evidence to the Local Lord (One of the seven dukes mentioned earlier) the Cultmaster was stripped of all ranks and titles and exiled from the Duke's lands, all quiet like. His crimes were never brought into the public eye.\n\nHe went by the name of Dural Suratal, and he didn't let that stop him.\n\nSoon enough, he 'ran into' (more likely sought him out) Prince Cassapin, the Wolf Prince, the Emperor's second son.\n\nSoon afterwards, his elder brother took an unfortunate turn for the dead, and a short while after that his younger Sister, the Falcon Princess, took an unfortunate turn for the 'disgraced and missing, possibly dead.'\n\nNow, the Emperor is a little busy in the West (starting a war will do that to you, espicially when your ally sues for peace indecently fast.)\n\nCassapin, his only child with a fixed address, has no oversight in the east, and enough chrasima that he wields it like a hammer to get what he wants.\n\nAnd he, perhaps due to Dural's influence and... Enhancements (Dural, Cassapin and some as of yet masked knights have enhanced strength and constitution. Which is good, or else they'd provide no challenge whatsoever) is a racist, murdering fuckhole.\n\nWell, actually the reason why we're organising the rebellion is because Svetlana is the direct descendent of Roren's last King (his personal holdings were passed over to his brother, whose descendents rule it to this day.) But Cassapin and the war is why we can pull it off.\n\nSo, we organised the festival, good.\n\nCassapin has heard about and turns up with Dural Suratal in tow, not good.\n\nNinassar's Timber, the Royal symbol of Roren, housed within the former royal castle the Red Hall, bears it's first fruit for decades on our first night in town for the Festival, good.\n\nSvetlana's kin (not that they know it) do not live there anymore, not good.\n\nCassapin occupies the Red Hall and bars access to everyone, *AH HELL NAW.*\n\nThe festival has been going on for a few days now. The Party has, by this point:\n\n* Been absolved of the accusations laid against them (Treason etc.) by the Svetlana's distant relation.\n* Introduced themselves to the ambassador from the country Vargo is at war at, who has been smuggled in because we'll need them.\n* Introduced oursleves to the Ambassador from the country we've aided and been aided by in the past, who we asked to be smuggled in at the request of one of the Dukes.\n* Fought off an assassination attempt on our Cal Thurr, our great supporter among the Dukes, which was blamed by Cassapin on 'Treasonous and Seccessionist elements' (The nerve of him! We are the Treasonous and Seccessionist elements!) And used as a pretext to bring 1000 men, handily in the area, to help safeguard the whole thing.\n* Verbally tarried with Cassapin, during which he called Ianya a bitch, and Kizmet collapsed the cart he was standing on because he annoys us *this much*.\n\n‐‐‐\n\nThe session opens at a fancy banquet, with the PCs (peasant adventurers, remember) seated at the top table, along with the Seven Dukes, the wife of Svetlana's distant relation. The seat at the head of the table is left empty, and Prince Cassapin storms off in a huff when informed it isn't for him.\n\nDural, however, remained at the low table.\n\nBy now, the eating is over and the formal dancing has begun. The discussion among the Dukes dances around the elephant in the room (the whole rebellion thing) but eventually Svetlana brings it up. I can't remember what happens next, but it ends without one of the Dukes (Whom we've dubbed The Loyalist because we'd pegged him to stay with Vargo no matter what,) storming out, ordering one of the other Dukes to follow him (and thus handily revealing his treachery to the rest of us.) As they exist, Dural gets up and stalks off himself.\n\nA few things happen now.\n\n*Ianya hurries off, polymorphs into her Raven form, flies up to the rafters where Andarta is watching, and they fly off in persuit of Dural.\n* Svetlana, who until now has been roleplaying the convsersation, begins the diplomacy rolls to draw the dukes under the banner of independence, and in addition, to stage a peaceful march on the Red Hall to gain access to the tree.\n* Kizmet begins working the crowd at the low table, in order to rally them to the peaceful march on the Red Hall.\n\nBoth rolls go well, and added to their generous diplomacy bonuses, soon enough we have one peaceful march. Well, it starts peaceful, but the nobles (and the crowd is, at first, made up entirely of Nobility, greater and lesser, along with their retainers and servents etc.) begin to arm themselves, swords worn but not drawn.\n\nMeanwhile. ahead of them, Ianya tracks Dural to the Red Hall, having discovered, due to a Spike Growth place entirely to annoy him, that he heals unnaturally fast.\nIanya, with Andarta in tow, decides it's high time she saw this tree for herself.\nGetting into a castle is an easy feat when you can fly, and soon enough Ianya finds... Where the tree was. A courtyard littered with toothless saws and blunted axes, and a vast crater from where the tree was uprooted, without a single wood shaving.\n\nIanya and Andarta hurry back to inform the others, only to find them at the head of a vast and growing column of petitioners. By now, Svetlana and Kizmet have bullied lay brothers into fetching the high priests of Ninassar, the Goddess of Roren, and naturally, Svetlana's Paladin deity: After all, it is her Timber.\n\nBreathlessly, Ianya informs the party of the tree's movement, whilst rapidly arming and armour herself from Kizmet's bag of holding.\n\nAfter some persusian, Kizmet agrees to inflitrate the Red Hall to find the tree alongside Ianya, who speeds off in Raven form to begin the search.\n\nAt the gate of the Red Keep, the troops, eight ranks deep, stand aside to allow Prince Cassapin to talk to 'his subject's (he has this annoying habit of acting like he's the Emperor, rather than his father.) At first Cal Thurr verebally spars with him, but he's outclassed. Svetlana steps up, and the Social Combat truly begins.\n\nMeanwhile, there were only so many doors large enough to admit a tree, and so Ianaya begins her hurried search of the Red Hall. Whilst there were twenty soldiers in the courtyard that did bear the tree itself, the rest of the soldiers are out on the walls or at the gate, leaving only servants in the Red Hall.\n\nIanya searches with reckless abandon, bursting open doors axe drawn and hackles raised. Subtlety is abondened: When she finds a locked door, she hurridly knocks on it if it can't be bludgeoned open.\n\nEventually she finds a door which she is sure is the right way, but it is locked and solid. She practically howls in frustration.\n\nFor roughly five minutes. Then Kizmet turns up and picks it in six seconds, opening the door to reveal a slope down into darkness. Snatching a nearby lantern, Ianya lights it and they hurry down. Remember this Lantern, it becomes very important later.\n\nOutside, Svetlana is doing what she needs to do (buy time) and more (not just simply engaging him, she might actually be winning the combat.)\n\nInside, the trio hurry along through locked door after locked door, the tumblers bowing before Kizmet's fingers. They're good locks... But Kizmet is excellent.\n\nQuickly, they come before what can only be described as a vault door: A thick, veritable wall or iron, only betraying the possibility of movement with the seam running down it's center and four vast circular locking mechanisms, which double as the mechanicisms used to actually open the damn thing.\n\nKizment cracks his knuckles and asks for a leg up, with Ianya putting down the lantern to offer it. They get to work, Andarta keeping watch.\n\nOutside, Svetlana has annoyed Cassapin into snubbing her: Apparently accquising, allowing the high nobility and the high priests access. A fresh round of arguments arise with Svetlana arguing for her right to access, Cassapin calling her a 'rabble‐rousing peasant'. All sorts of fun!\n\nKizmet, due to an fortunate series of 15+ rolls and his epic disable device bonus, rids the door/wall of three of it's four locks, a 23 minute task, in about 6 minutes, enough to open the door enough in the center to slip through, one at a time.\n\nKizmet slips through, then Andarta. There are lights inside..\n\nLo and Behold! We find Dural, sitting on the tree, one of the Red apples clenched in a fist, four Elite soldiers with him.\n\n\"So much fear and doubt,\" he quotes Lord of the Rings at us, \"over so small a thing. Such a little thing.\" He crushes the apple in his fist, and then does something to the soldiers that replaces their eyes with little fires and makes them move all wrong. Really fucking creepy.\n\nOutside, it's getting positively acrimonious: Cassapin claims that the tree bloomed for *him,* Casspin publicly shits on Roren and Ninissar, Cassapin accuses the party members of being Landed Knights of a foreign power (patently untrue: we are *un*landed knights of a foreign power.)\n\nNow, I should explain something about o/ur Player Characters: We're DPS, all of us. Kizmet has to second as a Speedtank, but that's not by choice. We win fights my making sure that the enemy wins the HP race to the bottom.\n\nMissing our Cleric, we take the only sensible strategy: Order Andarta to take some apples and return them to Svetlana: The apple can prove her heritage, and nothing else can.\n\nHowever, stupid me doesn't phrase the order properly, and she grabs an apple by the mouth. This is a bad idea: The Monarchs of Roren must consume one before ascending the throne, and it kills pretenders. Andarta is merely rendered unconcious.\n\nMissing our Cleric and our Dragon, we opt for the not sensible, but oh so tempting strategy: Focus on Dural until he dies.\n\nNow, Dural had DR of 15/Good. And our Paladin was elsewhere. Didn't matter, I had a magic item that aligned our weapons to Good. Kizmet had his sunblade and his boots of haste, and I had my +2 bow that also did 1d6 cold damage.\n\nKizmet does most of his damage while flanking, and Andarta's knocked out and Ianya's an Archer. Didn't matter: Summoun Backup Pony!\n\nWe ignored the four ex‐soldiers dogpiling us: Only Dural mattered.\n\nDural started with 130 hitpoints. It took us four rounnds to bring him down to 3, in four rounds. 130 to 3, by two characters (the poor pony never hit him) in four rounds, and for two of those rounds Kizmet was operating at a −2 to Str/Dex/Con, a act which healed Dural by some amount!\n\nOn his go on round 4, Dural twitches, writhes, and collapses as Kizmet gets an attack of opputunity. He rolls average, whereas most of the fight we'd been rolling above average on attacks, and gets, with bonuses, 25. As I established twice before in the fight, you need a 26 to hit him.\n\nKizmet leaps in the air, holding his Sunblade high, and striking it down, only to kiss a thick, black ooze, as Ooze‐Dural begins to make it's escape.\n\n*Fuck that* we say: He ain't getting away again.\n\nHe resists the Sonic Damage from Kizmet's helm of Blasting, but it stuns him, halting his healing. He's immune to Ianya's Chill‐tipped arrow.\n\nThe stun wears off, and the fucker has the cheak to heal in ooze form! The bastard's now above ten hp!\n\nKizmet's got one trick left: An enchanted throwing dagger than hits like a Fire Arrow.\nHe rolls to hit, and rolls low, but an Ooze ain't that hard to hit, and he passes on BAB alone.\n\nHe rolls damage: 4d6.\n\nThe GM hears the number and quaffs a surprised breath.\n\n\"129. You've done 129 damage to him. He had 130, and now he's got 1.\"\n\nI'm next in the initiative order. After me it's Dural, and he'll heal, and Kizmet's out of tricks and raging over the fact he stopped carrying alchemist's fire, due to the low damage it did...\n\nDid you remember the lantern?\n\n\"I kick the Lantern onto him.\"\n\nThe Fateless Campaign will return to /r/gametales soon: *Sans* one recurring Villain",

        "text": "One late night, a friend of mine texted me with an invitation: I was invited to a late-night \"meta-game\" of Vampire: The Masquerade (V20 tabletop rules), in which we played ourselves.  Upon showing up, I was told that I would be playing myself as a human, until the game's creation rules came into effect and someone decided to Embrace me (turn me into a vampire). \n\nIn-game, I turn up to our usual LARP as usual.  I noticed several of the players are unusually pale and gaunt, but it being a bunch of LARPers that isn't saying much.  Suddenly, I was Dominated (mind-control) into a room by one of my friends, D.  D had made a circle in what looked like blood, and was drawing weird symbols and chanting over the body of another friend, K.  I tried to stop him, but all of a sudden he grew fangs, and everything went black!\n\nI woke up surrounded by the rest of the group that had been similarly turned.  D was Prince D, head of the vampires in the city, and K was now Embraced by him and his pawn in some sort of strange goings-on in the city.  K had been Embraced before but wasn't \"good enough\", and my Embrace had somehow fixed that.  I was rapidly explained the \"good news\": Immortality!  Kewl powers!  And the bad news: I was a Caitiff.  (There are several clans who pass down their vampire powers reliably from vampire to newly embraced vampire.  Sometimes this goes wrong, and makes a Caitiff.  Caitiff get to pick their own powers from all the powers available, but pay for this by being firmly second-class citizens).  Steeling myself to deal with this fate, I picked the best powers in the game: Auspex (physical senses, telepathy, and the ability to astrally project while leaving your body safe), Dominate (mind control), and Presence (emotional control.  Makes people love you or unable to attack you).  \n\nSoon after, we were trying to introduce me to polite vampiric society, when the room we were in disappeared in a cloud of mist!  It was explained to me that some weirdness had gotten ahold of the Prince, and was sending the vampires in the city to this sort-of shadow realm, where our wills were made manifest, but dark things lurked at the corners and were hungry for our souls.  Upon hearing \"whatever you think of, if you think hard enough, becomes real\", I promptly turned to the GM and enacted my plan:\n\n\"I summon Baron Samedi.\"\n([Baron Samedi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baron_Samedi) is one of the gods of Haitian vodun.  The god of the crossroads of the living and the dead, he once encountered a vampire and started a clan of his own, which gets necromancy in exchange for the Baron being able to take over their bodies whenever he wishes)\n\nI mustered my will...and rolled 5 successes.  A dog promptly appeared in front of me, and made as if to encourage me to walk after it.  I walked out of the mists and into reality, where I came to surrounded by people, followers of the loa.  I was given the deal of necromancy and power in exchange for service to the Baron and to the community, and I promptly accepted.  Everything was going according to plan.",

        "text": "* [&lt;&lt; previous](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2hxdh0/vampiretm_john_randoms_revenge_part_8_long/)\n\nRegent lead him to the room with the Lasombra Sabbat brother in it. Lasombro had been nailed to a chair, and had the barest trickle of a blood transfusion set up - enough to keep him alive each night when he awoke, but not much more than that. Regent left Jalees alone, his face betraying his openly broken state. The Lasombro was in bad shape - cuts, burns, acid pits, pierced ear drums, lidless eyes - pretty much anything that could have been done with a red hot knife had been.\n\nLasombro’s eyes flicked to Jalees as soon as he entered, and he began to laugh. Among the Sabbat there is an introductory language, of sorts: body movements, specific phrases or speech patterns - things that a normal person would overlook, but Sabbat members immediately recognized. Jalees was displaying a few of these as he approached Lasombro. Lasombro did not miss them.\n\n&gt;Lasombro: “The Tremere finally found someone more competent to handle this job.”  \n&gt;Jalees: “None could be more competent than one of us.”  \n\nThe rest of this conversation takes places over Telepathy (Aus:4). The actual auditory conversation that carried on was a distraction for anyone who may be watching.\n\n&gt;J: “Knock, Knock” *standard sound of “I want to telepathy you”*  \n&gt;L: “Who are you? I didn’t know they had sent in any Assamites with the raid.”  \n&gt;J: “Oh, no, I was already here.”  \n&gt;L: “A blood traitor? Shit!”  \n&gt;J: “No, stupid. I’m Jalees Kamal, the infiltrator in the Domain.”  \n&gt;L: “Praise Caine! I don’t think I could have lasted much longer. Please, Jalees, you must help me.”  \n&gt;J: “There are only two ways out of this for you. Escape may be the worse option.”  \n&gt;L: “Unacceptable. I have important information regarding the movements of the Anarchs.”  \n&gt;J: *Jalees regurgitates similar information*  \n&gt;L: “How do you know all of that?”  \n&gt;J: “I’m the infiltrator, remember? I sent that information packet this morning.”  \n&gt;L: “Good. Fine. Maybe it would be better to let go. I’ve had a long enough unlife, right?”  \n&gt;J: “It’s never long enough, brother. I have an idea. Can you take the form of shadows? (Obten:5)”  \n&gt;L: “Yes, but I do not have enough blood.”  \n&gt;J: *Jalees mimes a slap at an appropriate moment in the auditory conversation, using the movement to slip a Bloodstone into his mouth. * “Make use of this blood, and quickly. You will hide in my clothing and I will leave ashes in your place.”  \n\nLasombro continues to talk around the stone as best as he could, which additionally gave the impression that he was slurring his speech slightly, giving slightly more credence that he was wasting away and would die shortly. When added to the immense amounts of concentration that it took to change forms, he deftly made it appear as though he had finally had his last, and crumbled away. Jalees quickly rushed over and allowed him into his clothing while spreading some fireplace ash that he had grabbed on the ride over around the chair in a fairly convincing pattern.\n\nJalees put on his most disapproving face and stormed back to the front room, where Tremere and Regent waited. He condemned the both of them for being so comically and cripplingly inept that he had not even the time to ask any informative questions before the subject had ashed. The both of them received a moderate volume, furiously intense verbal assault that gave both of them temporary RP traits of Timid and Broken, respectively. Jalees finished, still fairly quaking with rage ( actually laughter ), and stalked out of the door to return to his haven.\n\nLasombro hung around a couple of days in Jalees’ haven, slowly drinking his fill again and repairing his wounds. Jalees was delighted to have another Sabbat to babble on with about things, and brought him along to his next Black Hand meeting in the Shadowlands. The other Hands looked at him askance, but they all had a [Vaulderie](http://whitewolf.wikia.com/wiki/Vaulderie) and the Hands guided Lasombro back to his pack. Lasombro spreads tales far and wide of the heroically stoic menace to the Camarilla, and Jalees would later hear stories third or fourth hand, usually wildly out of proportion. \n\nLater, Jalees had the Harpy enter the Life Boon into the registry, and by now she knew not to ask. Jalees had a boon of one kind or another on nigh every Camarilla member in the Domain, and had even persuaded a few Anarchs into giving him a few - “unofficially” of course. Jalees fed key Domain members small amount of information in carefully worded phrases to point them in a direction. Most of the Camarilla members that followed his advice survived, but a few were captured in ambushes and killed or eaten. The Domain mourned them, but no one felt that it was directly Jalees’ fault for warning them. He had done his best, and was to be commended.\n\nJalees, under guise of Obfuscate and a few other tricks, had even participated in a few of the ambushes. He gained an additional 25xp from the feats, and dropped down to 8th generation. The Domain ended the week down 25% of its members, and the Anarchs had suffered similar losses - though they were mostly converts, not kills. The Prince and the Primogen Council ( which included Jalees, as the only Assamite in the Domain) held lengthy meetings for weeks debating what the best course of action would be. Jalees *helped* by being the devil’s advocate of the group, always pointing out the weakest part of the plan, and keeping the group going in massive circles. Perhaps a little less talk and a lot more action would have been better.\n\n* [ next &gt;&gt;](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2i4m3u/vampiretm_john_randoms_revenge_part_10long/)",

        "text": "Session Two - Dramatis personae, in which we are introduced to our players and find out how great and famous they are as hero adventurers (which isn't much).\n\n[Read Session One](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2hc3ga/diary_of_a_dungeon_master_prelude_to_the_worlds/)\n\nI recall spending many long nights in quiet contemplation, toking this and imbibing that, turning over the puzzle in my mind. It wasn't hard to figure out which combinations of race and class might be best suited to overcoming the challenges I might lay before them, and though the PCs had access to all my resources they didn't all possess the knowledge of synergy and mechanics that I did in making informed role decisions about the classes in the Party.\n\nWe started out with four players though through a fortuitous turn of events managed to acquire an enthusiastic fifth just before we launched, which I thought was excellent as the Party would surely need the extra muscle. I had only broached the subject of classes briefly before that first table meeting, and it was there where I feared everything might go awry. I stressed about their decisions, knowing it would be all too easy for a careless PC to cripple the entire party with an uninformed character design. How was I to make sure the party filled any gaps in their weaknesses without revealing that I was pushing them to make certain decisions for the greater good? I flat out told them, is how.\n\nIn fact I remember the first thing I said on the subject was something like \"I'm going to go over character creation with you guys very closely to make sure no one makes any stupid decisions like wanting to roll a Druid or something...\" Cory, the PC with the least amount of experience in the group (ie, none) happened to be flipping through the Core Rulebook on Renee's iPad at that moment, and I saw him abruptly swipe away from the Druid charts. And before any of the magical hippies cry foul, I'd like you to imagine role-playing as an honest Druid and then making the decision to willfully embark on a mission to more or less sequester yourself underground for two years. Not much nature down there beyond algae and fungus. Yeah, I didn't think so either.\n\nI watched as the iPad pages flicked past under Cory's fingers, and tried not to look too excited when he paused and began studying the Monk charts. He worried that this class had too many rules for a beginner like he. It was considerably the widest stat block in the chapter, but I tried to coolly explain that yeah there were a lot of things to keep track of but Monks were pretty much the Chuck Norris of stomping on monsters necks and thoroughly ruining the shit of any evil practitioner the Party might stumble across. I thought he might need a little more convincing by that point, but his next question was to ask me what exactly 'quivering palm' meant, and his reaction to the answer convinced me Cory was all set. I showed him how to open up the Advanced Race guide and told him it would probably be awesome to have a thing called *darkvision* (a thing I would repeat to everybody at some point), and left him to it.\n\nRob asked me politely if I could join him over where he sat clicking through .pdf pages on my laptop. I made sure he knew I'd rather asphyxiate on my own vomit than do such a thing, what are brothers for after all, but acquiesced once he admitted he wanted to step out of his wheelhouse for this character. Rob had learned to play while he was overseas, in Army and was only familiar with basic 3rd edition; the area previously referred to as his 'wheelhouse' consisting solely of levels in Dwarven Defender, which was actually a Fighter prestige class and also I'm pretty sure wasn't even a thing anymore. I told him any schmuck could swing a sword or a hammer, but it took a real man to be a *Wizard*. Magic, bro, is where it's at. I told him this mostly because I knew exactly how much of a hassle it was keeping track of spells known/casts per day and he would really just hate it, which I thought was great. \n\nI actually drilled down to the Cleric menu first and tried to sell him on the glamour and fame that came with being the party healer (a decision I lovingly referred to as \"biting the Cleric bullet\") and the influence he might wield in the decision making process. It didn't take, I'd pitched it in earnest to everyone else by this point so I had to try, but he was at least  interested in the magic bit so I switched tactics. Divine powers not for you? It's all good homie pull up a beanbag chair and feast your stank old wizard eyes on the plethora of arcane mysteries I have in store. Actually as the book describes it, with no way to leave or access to the outside world Wizards in the WLD get hosed almost as hard as Druids, but does offer a few variant rules and suggestions for coping if that's what the player really wants, one of which worked well with the introduction hook I decided to use and would let me grief my players into submission when they started to hassle me for every buff and bonus they could get their greedy little hands on. I was so proud of them.\n\nAnyways I knew I'll have to hold their hands through most of the process but to sweeten the pot I've promised each player a custom crafted item of power to get them started, as we would be beginning play at fourth level and jumping almost immediately into the action. Mark explained he had experience back into 2nd edition like myself but nothing with 3rd directly. He seems to know his way around a d20, but I'd had no exposure to his play style and at this point have only really known him for a few months. It didn't take long though, as he flipped through Renee's iPad when it was available and started asking me about multiple attacks per round, until I realized he was a power gaming weasel like myself as well as the type that might turn into a rules lawyer if he were to learn the system well enough. He seemed mostly interested in DPS, and his MMO/Xbox live play style grated on me at first. I told him DPS came in a lot of different flavors though, so he'd have to do a bit of research to find the kind he liked. This kept him quiet for most of the evening which Renee, as his girlfriend, was thankful for.\n\nRenee is my best and oldest friend at the table, and is the only PC present to have survived any of my previous campaigns. She was used to playing the caster, with many successful Sorceress and Bard shaped notches on her belt, so I felt it was time she get used to the front lines. She was somewhat hesitant at first, but she ultimately trusted my judgment. Especially after I told her she would potentially end up being the fulcrum of my story, which had plenty of perks she was interested in hearing about.\n\nBut I still wanted to see the party with some kind of healing ability at least, and Renee was on board with getting her hands dirty as it were, so I suggested she take a look at the Paladin. She was almost immediately turned off to the idea, literally shuddering when I said the phrase 'holy warrior'. But, I advised, I had a fully customized pantheon that didn't really behave like the domains of old. Her good aligned options for a divine benefactor were the Goddess of wisdom, motherhood, courage, and strategic warfare; golden Athena whom had split (and received the lion's share of) the might of Zeus' mantle with Hades after the Purge. Her Paladins were old school, classic style lawful-good heroes of justice and valor; I grinned as her expression soured. Or, I paused dramatically, she could throw her faith in with the motherfuckin' Thunderer, who was way more lax on the protocol and ceremony than his less hairy counterpart in goodness, so long as she made sure to worship by vigorously hammering the evil-loving-snot out of anything that threatened the innocent, in his furious name, Amen.\n\nI knew she was sold before she did. I watched as her eyes flicked the page and the wheels began to turn, she was holding the only physical copy of the Core Rulebook we had and was splitting the pages with all the fingers of her left hand while flipping back and forth, putting things together between disparate chapters. She was a sharp girl and I knew she was going to make the right choice, but I may have seemed a little disappointed after her frenetic search for inspiration when she informed me her plan was to do exactly as I'd suggested and put all four of her starter levels into Pally, but had a plan. I was expecting some grand amalgamation of concepts but quickly realized she had chosen a more subtle path. \n\nThor wasn't exactly the most lawful dude around, she informed me matter-of-factly. I blinked, like, duh? She knew this because I knew this; I'd designed my Thor to split the Good/Evil axis with Hades better than the Law/Chaos side of things with Athena and Loki (it didn't even take a lot of effort), thus personifying the balance of scales rather neatly, I thought. She agreed, and with the widest grin advised me it was Thor's will to find himself a champion both righteous *and* furious, and thus I should be perfectly willing to waive the lawful-only and non-lawful-only prerequisites for Paladins and Barbarians; which was quite simply one of the nastiest multi-class combinations I could think of in terms of breaking rule mechanics, for exactly the two reasons she wanted me to give her permission to ignore.\n\nWe high-fived once an hour for the rest of the evening. I mean, c'mon; Smite *and* Rage? It was perfect, elegant, and made things easier to manage from my end than I had expected this mess to be, considering the difficulty I'd had arranging any kind of party for the last decade. There had been starts and stops, I'd advertised on roll20, meetup, and other LFG forums as well as physically in the only good pair of game shops I'd had access to. I was determined to make this happen or it was going to kill me, so let's recap. At this point I had four PCs, each with character concepts of varying degrees of nastiness. I'd managed to guide them into some semblance of properly defined roles, but things were a little messy because it looked like some responsibilities would need to be split and shared between members. \n\nRenee was settling into an off-tank/off-heal build, which I advised them would only work out for so long. She'd found the idea of the half-celestial Aasimar right up her ally though, and I let her know she looked like a pretty attractive candidate for something called Chosen of the Divine which would make my intentions for her role in the campaign pretty clear after too long. I told her Thor wasn't necessarily wielding Mjolnir in an exclusive fashion anymore, let her mull over what this might mean for her, and put a pin in it. She didn't come up with a proper name until the next session but started using Red Sonja as a handle in the interim. We joked about plate-mail bikinis for the rest of the week but she eventually passed me a ninja-note with her 'Secret Name', an idea I adored. We're both huge fans of the Dresden Files and recognize the importance and power of knowing the proper Names for things, even people.\n\nCory really liked the idea of eventually utilizing a Dim Mak, and pledged his loyalty and willpower to the pursuit of martial perfection with the patience and strength of living stone. No, really, he found an advanced race called Oread which were pretty much humanoids crossed with earth elementals. So a Monk that was also basically a golem. Great. He didn't seem keen on the idea of multi-classing and figured he could stay pure and be more than fine on the front lines, so we had our main tank. We'd revisit the topic in a few levels, I thought, but let him roll stats to bring Braxton Granite to life.\n\nI found it fortunate that my brother Rob was getting behind the Wiz-biz, because there was a rather important arcane hook I wanted to use to rope them all into my labyrinth, and he was the perfect pawn I needed to guide this unsuspecting group of adventurers to their ultimate if gritty doom. I mean destiny. I also caught him browsing the prestige classes chapter and wondering to Mark how stacking arcane and divine caster levels worked. I didn't know much of anything about Fetchlings when he showed me during his turn with the Race Guide, but I could work with the descendants of humans that migrated to and cross-bred with some of the things on the plane of shadow pretty easily with this kind of campaign, so I gave him the green light to bring some soul to Alton Freth, especially since he seemed interested in a prestige class called Mystic Theurge.\n\nMark had done as I'd suggested and spent that entire first session putting together a comprehensive DPS spreadsheet for all the base classes, and when I pointed out there were a few more in the Advanced Players Guide plus plenty of archetypes in the other combat/magic supplements he only nodded and continued to compile data. We talked about Races after a bit and since he was leaning pretty heavily towards Ranger was wondering if I'd allow a full-blooded Drow into the party. I groaned because this was the first serious cliche we'd run into but I soon learned that Mark had no honest knowledge of who or what Drizzt had been about thousands of years before this campaign was set to take place. After I explained exactly how unlikely it was for a pure blooded male to survive the trip and resettlement to the surface world, a rule which as far as I'm concerned doesn't have any credible exceptions, he tried in vain to suggest he might play a female instead. I had somehow given him the impression it was the male-part and not the Drow-part which was detrimental to his concept, and I disabused him of the notion while I attempted to not laugh in his face.  \n\nEventually though we came to an agreement. Since we apparently had a whole half-human theme going on here I suggested we could swap some of the racial crap on the half-elf chart and he think about a 'born of rape and slavery' kind of back-story. I've only ever seen one working half-Drow anywhere in errata (Demon Stone for PS2) but since they were the outcasts of the outcast world the concept was more than open enough for me to work into my setting. We started to get a little racist at this point, since we now had varying degrees of alabaster/ash/charcoal skin to go around, and Mark decided Merendel was the kind of cool guy that could rock a single name. Cool.\n\nEdit: words, links\n(Continued in comments below)",

        "text": "So, as I said, I just got done with my first session of D&amp;D. I have been wanting to play for years, and, after buying the starter set last week, finally managed to round up a few of my friends to play. My one friend, who had some experience as a DM for Pathfinder, offered to make a campaign for me, solo. After I had accrued a few friends to come along, he decided he would just scale up the campaign for 4 people. And this is where my story begins.\n\nNow, I must admit, there was much beer drank during this, so bear with me, as the details may be foggy. \n\nThe story starts with my party on a boat. We decided to skip the whole, \"Lets get to know each other\" stage, and assumed that after 3 weeks at sea, you tend to know who you're bunking with pretty well.\n\nAs it goes, all of us received invites for a mysterious competition. Being new adventurers, we jumped at the opportunity. The party consisted of a LN Dwarf Cleric (Hereby known as Pouty), A Halfling Rogue (Midget), A Human CG Fighter (Minion), and Myself, a CN Human Wizard. We were all level one, and had minimal supplies.\n\nSo we step off the boat, and amass with the rest of the adventurers, at the docks. The man running the event, tells us that we are to go on a search for several hard to come by items. The first adventurer to bring all of the items to the lords manor will be deemed the winner, and receive a prize of great import. Although the items may seem like they would be easy to come by, some of them were very hard to find on the island. The items in question are\n\nA Healing Potion\n\nAn Elvin Longbow\n\nA Red Fez\n\nA Large Seashell\n\nA Detailed Mosaic Tile\n\nAnd a Lute\n\nNow, seeing as how this was a rather small island, and there were adventurers abound, we did what any other group would do, in a race against the clock, rush to glory event like this.\n\nWe went to the tavern.\n\nAs we walk in, we are greeted by the barkeep, and a fairly busy bar. Being the first one in, I spot a group of 3 tavern wenches along the bar. Doing what I want, I cast Charm Person on the 9/10 wench, and go off to the upper levels. The party, however, notices the bard in the corner, playing a beautiful lute. All three attempt to start a conversation with the bard, in an attempt to gain the lute for the party. The bard is willing to sell the lute, for a whopping 50 gold. The party has a combined 34 gold, and are unable to make the deal. They argue and bicker for several minutes with the bard, which resorts to attempts of bribery with drinks, and promises of payment later on. Meanwhile, I come back downstairs (Failed constitution save), and begin to try and drink myself into a stupor with liqour. Another failed constitution save, and I find myself puking on the bartender, and getting kicked out. Meanwhile, the cleric attempts to intimidate the bard into dropping the price. He rolls a natural 1, and the bard decides he has made his wages for the day, and packs up.\n\nThe group follows him outside, and the rogue decides to trail him to his home, with the plan to steal the lute later on. I talk the fighter into going up the hill, and checking out a cave that we had overheard talk of in the bar. He agrees, and off we go. Dwarfy McCuddleface decides to stick around town, and check in with the shops. He walks up to several shops, with the doors closed, and doesn't even attempt to open them. (First time playing.) He then sits down outside the blacksmith, and pout.\n\nMeanwhile, Myself and Minion make a brief walk up the hill, with the plan to meet the others at a later time. We end up finding an alchemist along the way. They have potions for sale, and I once again talk my minion into doing something silly. He spends the rest of his gold buying 3 healing potions. He gives one to me, and I let him have the other 2, so he can feel important. After speaking with the alchemist, we find that the cave is not far away, and infested with rats. She does, however, tell us that it used to be a shrine, with a beautiful mosaic floor. We thank her for this information, and head on up to the cave.\n\nMidget, however, is still trying to case the bards house. He attempts to look in through the windows, and seems to forget that he is only roughly 3 1/2 feet tall, and the windows are 4 feet up. He tries to jump up and see, and ends up getting spotted by a guard. He tries to explain to the guard that he was just trying to see if the house was a shop, and the guard believes his bluff.\n\nPouty McPoutersome is still pouting, and doesn't understand that he has to open the doors to go through them.\n\nMinion and myself, however, are just coming up to the cave. Outside the cave, we find a lone guard, standing outside the cave. I happen to notice however, that he is wearing a very nice red fez. Words are exchanged, because I am still pretty drunk, and mistakes begin to be made. I, err, accidentally zap the guard in his face with lightning. Yeah, uh, accidentally. Anyways, Minion takes this opportunity to help his friend(Master) and charges headfirst into the fray. Minion did not, however, notice that I was in the process of casting a cone of flame. This worked out pretty well, because in my inebriated state, I did not seem to realize that fez's(Fezii?) were made of cloth.\n\nMinion tackles the guard, causing him to just barely be struck in the legs by my fire. The poor minion, however, took a solid 8 damage, and had to take one of his healing potions the next turn. I continued to shoot lightning at the guard, who finally succumbs to the power of electricity.\n\nI now have a new hat.\n\nWe continue into the cave, and get our asses kicked by some rats, before we turn around, and run.\n\nPouty and Midget are now both at the bards house, and goddamnit, this bard is being a real prick. Pouty, who has used his solemn meditation to think of a new strategy decides what better way to turn a new leaf with the bard, than to try and break down the door.\n\nMeanwhile, Midget has successfully stolen a bucket of water from the well, and is now on the way to the roof, to pour the bucket of water down the fireplace, where he plans to sneak in to steal the lute.\n\nThey never actually met each other. They just both happened to want to mess with the bard at the exact same time.\n\nSo, Midget attempts to climb a building with a full bucket of water, gets to the top, and realizes that he has spilled all the water.\n\nPouty fails his strength role, and does nothing more than bang on the door forcefully. Which is met by a greater force. The bard has decided that he has had enough with these two, and has opened the door, now with a sword instead of a lute.\n\nYou see, neither Pouty or Midget seemed to realize the sequence of events that the poor bard has gone through today.\n\nFirst, he is at work, playing songs, when a strange group approaches him, attempting to buy his lute. He offers them a fair price, but is then told it is too high. This group, then, however, decides to attempt to get him drunk, while on the clock, while the strange dwarf gives terrible pickup lines, before becoming so angry he started to yell incoherantly. Seeing as how this was a bit odd, the bard now tries to head home, only to be followed by the harassing group. Not to mention, the dwarf who can't take a hint. Which then spent the next 6 hours hanging out across the street, staring into his window with a scowl on his face, before deciding to run up and attempt to break his door in.\n\nNeedless to say, the bard was justified in his actions.\n\nCombat did not last long, as Midget stood on the roof watching the whole time, and Pouty decided he didn't want to fight, mainly because the guard was watching the entire thing, and had (thankfully) intervened. Now getting kicked out of town, Pouty and Midget decide to head towards the lake, and see if they can find some seashells.\n\nThey find a couple of wells along the way, and Pouty decides that it would be a good idea to search the bottom of the well for any seashells. He does this by jumping into the well. The 30 foot well. The drinking well. As a dwarf.\n\nSo, Pouty is now drowning, and Midget is too short to reach the lever to release the bucket. Thankfully, Midget CAN jump, and saves Pouty from a less than desirable demise. They leave the well to itself, and come across another well, not to far away from it.\n\nWhich Pouty, not learning his lesson the first time, jumps into.\n\nSee above paragraph.\n\nSo, After being saved from water for the 2nd time, the toddler duo decide to check out a tent along the lake. Here, they find out that the only person who sells large seashells is Sally. She lives in a shop, down on the east side of the island, right along the beach. See where this is going?\n\nSo, off they go, to find Sally, and her little shop of seashells.\n\nMinion and I have taken a brief rest, and are now on our way to the east side of the island, to check if there was anything of importance in a lone store we see. Lo and behold, it is Sally's store, and we have met up with the lesser half of our entourage. We head in, and Sally is more than glad to sell us the sea shell, for a mere 5 Gold. Minion asks to inspect it, and Sally agrees. Minion, not being the brightest, attempts to run out of the store with the seashell, forgetting that although he doesn't have enough to buy the shell, the rest of us do.\n\nOh, and before he runs out of the store, he hands the shell off to me, because \"I'm faster.\" (I'm not.)\n\nSo, Sally, witnessing all this, now raises the price to 6 Gold, which we pay with sincere apologies, and off we go to find where Minion is off to. I now have a Red Fez, a healing potion, and an Ocean Simulator on my person.\n\nWe head towards the other cave, where we see Minion running. Only this time, he is running TOWARDS us.\n\nAlso, there is a bugbear following him. Pouty uses his action to pout.\n\n\nAnd that ends the tale of my first time playing D&amp;D. Sadly, Midget and Minion had to head out right afterwards, and we had to call it a night. I hope you enjoyed reading it, and if people want, I can write up our next adventure next week!\n\n\nTLDR: Get Drunk, Find Red Fez, Sally sells seashells by the sea shore, Dwarfs have ugly pouty faces.",

        "text": "* [&lt;&lt; previous](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2hsvke/vampiretm_john_randoms_revenge_part_7_mediumnew/)\n\nJalees had several options, all of them bad to some degree. The best, and probably safest, course of action was to offer Tremere help with his task, “As we Children of Haqim have an effective power of the blood for these sort of things.” Translation: Clan Assamite has Quietus, which can be very persuasive if applied with a gentle touch. Tremere was wary, and Jalees confirmed that Tremere can have all of the credit - Jalees is “merely serving the Domain as best as I can.” Tremere resigned somewhat, but told Jalees that he would have to pass it up the chain and see what response he got.\n\n*aside*  \nClan Tremere is odd, to commit understatement, and I will attempt to simplify without twisting facts too terribly. Clan Tremere is organized in a pyramid and use the number 7 a lot. Headed by the Council of Seven, generally the seven eldest tremere, who oversee Pontifices, who oversee Lords, who oversee Regents, who oversee Apprentices. Each of these are broken into seven ‘circles’ or levels, and ideally each Tremere in a level oversees seven Tremere of the previous level, but that almost never happens. A Regent of the Second Circle would oversee seven Regents of the First Circle, and his own Chantry. A Regent of the First would oversee seven Apprentices of the Seventh Circle, most if not all would be a part of his Chantry. And such like. Each Chantry has a Regent at the helm. The Regent is the head honcho of the Chantry, unless a Lord or higher rank stops in.  \n*end aside*\n\nJalees now has the enviable task of fast-talking a Regent of Clan Tremere. After Elysium, Tremere invites Jalees back to the Chantry after gaining permission from Regent. This particular Regent was a hardass - he might have been more Tremere than the Tremere, progenitor of the Clan, himself! Regent had made his way from the bottom of the totem pole to Regent of the Fourth Circle in a little over a decade, which I would describe as a meteoric rise, except that meteors fall, not rise. Regent had every bit of Clan lore, law and social norms tattooed on his brain, and ensured that everyone else remembered them as well - a Drill Sergeant of the Tremere if ever there could be one.\n\nRegent took one look at Jalees and dismissed his very existence. Regent was not at all happy that Tremere had as of yet not cracked his charge, despite having had several days of interrogation. Tremere replied that he “had neither the proper training nor temperament for this sort of work”, and that perhaps outside assistance from an “experienced professional” would be both a welcome change and far more effective than anything he could devise. Regent gave Tremere an almost wild-eyed look, and then gave Jalees a full acknowledgement and once-over. His lip twisted in distaste, and he spoke with a faint snarl when he replied: “Tremere need not the help of the Saracens.”\n\nJalees smiled, and said nothing. Saracen is an old, old name for Clan Assamite - Dark Ages old. No one that had even the tiniest amount of respect used the term anymore. More important people than Regent had been killed for using the term to the wrong Assamite. Jalees, however, was Sabbat Assamite, and could not care less about what he was called in service to the cause. As the two began to go at each other, Jalees decided to use Thaumiturgical Sight on the pair, to see if they had any active rituals or magical items on their person; results inconclusive on Tremere, but Regent was fairly well protected from a number of things - he had been expecting a fight. Regular Aura Sight kicked in, revealing that not only was Regent angry, he was also fearful and hiding something. Regent and Tremere argued for a while longer, until Jalees’ pocketwatch chimed softly - his one hour until sunrise alarm - which broke the two apart for enough time for Jalees to get words in:\n\n&gt;Jalees: “Sir Regent, I am offering aid in service to the Domain. I hold neither malice nor envy for Clan Tremere, and I am more than capable of completing this task, with the specific set of skills that I have gained. Normally interrogation is unnecessary, but it will not be the first time I have improvised with what tools I have on hand.”  \n&gt;Regent: “No, as I stated earlier, we need no aid from outsiders. Clan Tremere will handle this task on its own!”  \n&gt;J: “Perhaps you are against outside because of the nature of the task? It did not come from the Prince, you took it upon yourself.”  \n&gt;R: “What!? Nonsense!”  \n&gt;Tremere: “Is that true? Have you not told the Prince?”  \n&gt;J: *Rolls Empathy to detect lying, gets only one success - not a lot to go on, but I gamble* “The Prince knows nothing of this task and he certainly did not hand it to Regent - I conferred with him before we left Elysium. Regent is holding onto the subject in order to maneuver into more power against the Prince. Is the Chantry not quite large enough for your ego anymore, Regent?”  \n&gt;R: *Rolls a Frenzy check, barely makes the roll. With murder in his eyes:* “You lying sack of shit! You Saracens are liars, cheats, thieves and Diablerists. You can’t just go around making up half-wit theories to fit whatever evidence you think exists, Saracen!”   \n\nAt this point, Regent rolls Lure of Flames 4 targeted at Jalees. It is important to note that at this point in time no one has seen Jalees perform Assamite Sorcery of any kind. It is also important to note that the Thaumiturgical path of Countermagic has no visible ‘tell’ that it is in use. Whatever blood magic it is used against merely fizzles, as if whoever cast it failed. The Regent attains 3 successes, which is enough to contain the flame to Jalees alone, and not any of the room around him. However, Jalees has Countermagic 5, which gives 10 dice of negation. I roll my ten dice and achieve 6 successes. I ask the ST if, though it is outside of the listed effects, as I had doubled his successes perhaps it could be treated as a very light botch - not enough to do any real damage, but enough to maybe be interpreted as Jalees being impervious to magic. ST has no qualms.\n\nRegent flings his hand out and mutters a word, aptly tossing a bonfire-sized flame directly at the specific volume Jalees is currently occupying. Jalees makes no obvious moves, seemingly takes the hit, which had begun to fizzle just after Regent threw it. Visually, it looked like a smoke ring bouncing off of something solid, rebounding radially outwards on a vertical plane - and Jalees was in the middle. Not a single singed hair on his impeccable head, his clothes not even ruffled. The fire fizzled out with a faint pop before it got too far, and even the fire that had caught on a few objects died out. Regent’s eyes were wide enough that they could have high-fived each other, and Tremere had gone utterly still. Jalees lead with an Intimidation roll - 8 successes on 7 dice, no contest.\n\n&gt;Jalees: “Now that we have that out of the way, perhaps we could get down to business? You will show me to the subject, and I will get what answers you so sorely desire that you would attempt to put the Prince’s own subject to death to cover your pitifully weak ass. You owe me a [Blood Boon](http://oldwiki.mindseyesociety.org/index.php/The_Protocols_of_the_Camarilla#Blood_Boon) for your attempt on my life, and because of your severe incompetence and uncontrolled selfishness, we’ll call it a [Life Boon](http://oldwiki.mindseyesociety.org/index.php/The_Protocols_of_the_Camarilla#Life_Boon).”  \n&gt;Regent: “But - ”  \n&gt;J: *backhands him* “This is not a discussion. You have successfully found the edge of my patience. Pray you do not find yourself falling over it. Show me to the subject, and then come back here and wait for me to return. Tremere, you stay here.”  \n&gt;Tremere: “O-Of-Of course, ~~Jac~~ Jalees.”    \n\n\n* [next &gt;&gt;] (http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2i0y9f/vampiretm_john_randoms_revenge_part_9_medlong/)",

These instances aren’t terribly related to the story at hand, but I may come back with some of those encounters at a later point in time.\n\nIn which the Sabbat makes the First Move -\n\nTraditionally, the Sabbat takes over a Domain in three stages:  \n 1. The Sabbat send in ghouls and supporters to set up safe havens and resource caches.  \n 2. The Sabbat send in particularly sneaky or death-resistant members to cause havoc and break the Masquerade like mad.  \n 3. The Sabbat enter en masse, the main force takes the City street by street in necessary, but by this point the Camarilla usually fold pretty quickly under the full force of the Sabbat.  \n \nSometimes, as is the case this time, step 1 is accompanied by an ultra-sneaky, highly backed, stringently selected infiltrator is sent along with the initial wave. Generally the infiltrator is supposed to find as much information on as many different subjects as possible. Normally about 50-60% of the information gathered is on the bottom dregs of the Domain - the social outcasts, the Anarchs, the clanless - and the rest is on the Camarilla structure as a whole.\n\nJalees, however, is the shining example of everything going perfectly, having handed complete dossiers on every NPC member of the Domain, as well as fairly accurate dossiers on the PCs. The entire Domain had been mapped from top to bottom, locations of Havens, webs of connection, and on and on. His Black Hand brothers had passed the information on - Jalees had been keeping in regular contact via the Shadowlands rituals he had been taught - and had come back that the timetable of the plan was being moved up. The second step was going to be started within the month, and he was expected to help his fellow Sabbat as best he could, without blowing his cover.\n\nJalees had just finished communing with his superior via *Pebble from the Mountain* when he received an encrypted email to his Sabbat address. The ST had assured me that this was 100% plot important stuff, and not subject to being discovered by the players at all. Jalees perused the mail, and it was essentially a minute-by-minute schedule of the next week, including every target the Sabbat were going to hit, how it was to be hit, what sort of destruction and disruption was going happen, and suggestions on how to leverage the knowledge in his favor.\n\nThe game had been running about six months at this point, and about three years had passed in-game, the PCs had opened up to Jalees a bit more, and Jalees did his best to seem more open and friendly with them. He routinely chatted with them about whatever was on their mind, and had helped them out of no few dire straits. Jalees, however, seemed to never bear more weight than his shoulders alone could handle. A firm handshake and a quiet word, and doors opened, other vampires much his elder bowed to him and listened intently when he spoke. It had started to get on the hackles of Ventrue.\n\nVentrue, being the de facto leader of the group ( and Tremere holding all of the real power ), had started to make some bad decisions. He had forced Brujah into a corner on a couple of issues that had arisen in regards to the Prince and the Domain - Brujah thought that the Prince was, overall, a “twit who could not run a business the size of himself” while the Ventrue backed the Prince almost exclusively. He had staked Malkavian more than once, after he started to have more depth and intricacies as a character - that’s my fault, I had been talking with Malkavian’s player a lot about how the character could have a ‘descent into madness’ and come out a far more entertaining character to play as and with; I mostly succeeded, though the character was still fairly flat. \n\nBut most recently and importantly, Ventrue had become concerned with Tremere. Tremere had been coming and going at odd hours, suffered mysterious injuries that he wouldn’t talk about, and generally being highly secretive about whatever he was doing during his days. Ventrue, being more self-centered than the average bear, was under the impression that Tremere was attempting to pull Ventrue’s leadership out from under him. This, of course, was preposterous. Tremere was far more interested in learning his thaumaturgies than with actually making decisions outside of his clan.\n\nJalees took a while to convince Tremere that he could be trusted, and wouldn’t tattle to Ventrue or to any other Tremere. Jalees genuinely wanted to help, and any inroads he made with Tremere might help in diablerising him later. Tremere had been tasked by his Regent to interrogate a Sabbat Lasombra that had been captured. This, understandably, made Jalees intensely interested. A brother had been captured, and taken to interrogation? Unacceptable. He would have to correct the situation.\n\nTremere explained that he had been having problems, the Lasombra had high Obtenebration (Discipline about controlling darkness, moderately powerful ) and a bit of Abyss Mysticism ( Blood magic of darkness, highly powerful when done right) and was generally being a lot better at resisting torture than Tremere had been at applying it. “[Tremere is] an academic, dammit! [He] should be studying handwritten tomes to distill improved magic and better rituals!” Jalees listened, nodding along and making all of the right noises at appropriate times, plotting his best course of action to free his Lasombra brother from captivity.\n\n* [next &gt;&gt;](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2hxdh0/vampiretm_john_randoms_revenge_part_8_long/)",

        "text": "By now we understood what was going on for the most part. Our party - along with several civilians - was trapped in a dungeon and being led from puzzle to puzzle. The fourth room was much the same - shortly after entering the room a magical fog appeared to obscure our vision.\n\nBefore any of us could form any defensive plans or rally, the fog dissipated on its own. However, our somewhat overwhelmed Tiefling Necromancer was no longer singular - there were three of him. Of course, all three claimed to be the real one, so we had an investigation to run.\n\nNow, our party hasn't been known for being particularly graceful. We've managed to solve an encounter through non-combat trickery, but we've also accidentally killed a large number of guards during a training exercise because we thought they were bandits and ambushed them. Our party at the time consisted of the following:\n\n* The previously mentioned Necromancer, who is a quite crazy and absent-minded.\n\n* A neutral Monk who is straightforward and tends towards violence as a solution to difficult problems.\n\n* A psychotically evil Fighter who's bloodlust is tempered only by his simplicity.\n\n* (Me) A sociopathic Warlock who cares only about herself, a standard code of conduct, and her team - in that order. \n\n* An Evoker and a Bard who, while quite strongly good-aligned, are both very docile and unassertive.\n\nAfter quickly understanding the situation, I tried to figure out which Necromancer was real through questioning. I asked them to produce a spell and they all did so. I asked them questions the Necromancer should know - and then I quickly realized that he was far too unreliable and unpredictable for this to go anywhere. When an answer of \"I have no fucking idea\" doesn't immediately rule someone out of contention there isn't much hope.\n\nI would have continued this line of questioning, but our Fighter decided that \"the clones will obviously dissapear when they fall unconcious!\" and knocked the third clone unconscious. Our Monk, deciding that this logic was as sound as anything else he could think of, immediately went on the first clone. A few seconds later and we had two unconcious clones and one clone with a broken arm being grappled to the floor. And of course, none of them dissapeared.\n\nWith no real way to progress, we simply rested until they woke up again. This time I managed to take charge, holding back constant suggestions for further violence, and used my charm magic. Unfortunately, all I managed to do was discover that they all believed themself to be the real clone and frighten the first clone with my terror-amplfied threats. Taking the one-third odds of random success was quickly becoming considered an option and tensions were high. The civilians with us were also becoming increasingly horrified, and would likely be afflicted with intense PTSD for the rest of their lives.\n\nLuckily, fortune struck. Our Monk noticed that two of the clones had rainbow colors glowing from their eyes. Furthermore, one of those two clones was unconscious and during that time his eyes were normal. He announced this and we realized that the clones must be simply copying the spell effects. The first clone had normal eyes because he didn't notice the spell being cast, and the second clone had glowing eyes only after he realized the spell had been cast. The only clone that didn't need to recognize the spell beforehand - clone three - must be real.\n\nNow it has to be said that this was shaky logic. We assumed that the clones couldn't independently cast spells, in which case they could make their eyes glow whenever. We assumed this was his spell and not an effect of the clones themselves. We assumed this meant anything at all. However, our party was strained physically, mentally, and emotionally, and when the Fighter decided to snap the first clone's neck there was no one willing to get in his way. Shortly afterword, the second clone got his next snapped as well and we were reunited with our (supposedly real) ally.\n\nWe took some time looting the corpses, I mutilated the first clone's corpse to maintain my promised threat, and the civilians, Bard, and Evoker looked on in horror at our gathering of psychopaths. The puzzle completed, we were rewarded with an open door to the side and a lever in the center of the room.\n\n[Part 2 in comments](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2hs0jw/dnd_5e_in_that_dungeon_we_learned_that_everyone/ckvgib4)\n",

A fun thing I try to do is keep up with \"kill Counts\" of the party. This drives a freindly competition of the party trying to be glory hogs and trying to get the most kills. The party consists of:\n\nAugustan- Ranger with a murder horse. The ostensable \"leader\" of the Warband and has easily the highest kill count\n\nAthos- Nature Fang Druid Augustan's brother. Has mastered an Ancient Giant Spell that is similiar to DBZ's Spirit Bomb\n\nKiran \"the Dwarf\"- Armor Master Fighter. A skilled fighter whose fighting style and tactics are similar to dwarves. \n\nKealan- Cleric of the Undying Court, Former PC now NPC who provides the warband with healing and support.\n\nThe Warband has been tracking the BBEG for most of the campaign and have finally tracked him to some ancient super weapon that he wants to activate. Wanting to get there as fast as possible they call in a few favors and get an airship to transport them to the site ASAP.\n\nThe BBEG also called in all favors and was able to recruit a young blue to assist him and had him cover the airspace around the site of the weapon. \n\nThis results in an airborne battle where initially the dragon has the upper hand, dodging and weaving below the ship only revealing himself to breath weapon. Athos decides to give him a surprise present next time the dragon says reveals himself. Dragon takes Spirit bomb point blank and retreats into the clouds beneath the airship allowing the warband to buff and heal. \nThe Dragon Returns weary of the blast, and starts trying to destroy the ship from below. Augustan activates his slippers of Spider climb and walks along the bottom of the ship to engage the dragon in melee. Athos attaches a rope to the side of the ship and begins to Tarzan down to the dragon sword in hand. The dragon seeing its defeat drops off the bottom of the ship and fires one last breath weapon at Augustan and through the bottom of the ship. The blast goes through the ship and one shots Kealan into Negatives, but also leaving a large hole right through the ship. \n\nAugustan, wanting to secure the kill on the Dragon (and taking all the glory) releases his hold on the bottom of the ship and lands squarely on the back of the dragon. Not wanting to be out done, Kiran (whos still on the deck of the ship manning Balista's) runs past Kealan's bleeding body and dives through the hole after the dragon.... and Fails his acrobatics check to reach the dragon. Now plummeting to is doom. Thankfully Augustan is able reach out and grab over the side of the dragon. Kiran is now holding on for dear life off the side of the dragon. Athos, still tarzaning, wants a piece of the glory and decides that its a great idea to try and dog pile onto the dragon and leaps from his rope and.....\n\nRolls a 1 on his acrobatics check. He goes hurtiling below the dragon out of reach of his brother. But not the other poor soul who missed his jump, and Kiran was able to catch the light weight Athos. Augustan is barely able to hold on thanks to the Bull Strength the now gurgling cleric gave him earlier. Now Having a chain of suicidal elves on its back, the dragon decides to dive in hopes of getting them off. Athos was able to climb up the chain onto its head while Augustan swings Kiran onto the Dragons tail.\n\nThey then proceed to race to see who kills the doomed blue dragon first. The poor sucker never stood a chance. Athos eventually was the victor as his Frigid Touch freezes the dragon solid. Sadly they are still hundreds of feet up when this occurs. Augustan and Kiran hold onto dear life for each other hoping Augustan's Feather fall ring carries them both, while Athos decides to ride the dragon down to its doom. Everyone survived the fall. \n\nThe crew of the ship decide that they had enough of those insane elves, force a potion down Kealan's throat, and send him and the warband's horse's down to the players and they proceed to skin the hell out the dragon.\n\nI believe that there is something to be learned here, a slight competition to out do each other leads players into some insane situations... and its glorious.",

        "text": "I'm a first time DM running Keep on the Shadowfell for my first time players.\nI've mixed it up a bit, and the party was set up to ambush a stagecoach bringing a Orcus statuette of power to the keep (My addition, as a way for apologizing for having them get ambushed so many times be kobolds).\n\nThe party is a Dragonborn Bard with a crazy high intimidate score, a elf noble in exile who snipes from the shadows and hides his past, a half orc barbarian who keeps planning to buy a wagon, and loves charging.  There is also the Shifter warden, who is the voice of reason at times, and keeps just barely surviving double crits to the face.  And of course there is a human wizard too, who is rather trigger happy, and keeps asking if the warden minds if he gets blasted a little by the aeo he wants to throw out.\n\nThey did a great job, cutting down a tree to block the road, and pretending to be a road crew to distract the guards outside the coach, and killing them while covering up the sound with the work on the road.  Then they disguise the elf as one of them (they rolled to shoot the guard in the face to avoid blood on the suit), and asked the bodyguard to come out and help move the log.  He does so, leaving his halberd and shield inside of course.  He is dispatched silently again, though it takes almost everyone.\n\nAt this point, they roll a 1 for the bluff to get my bad guy fighter to come out of the coach, so he releases the 3 shadowhunter bats he had locked up in cages, and charges out.  But without the rest of his escort, he is quickly overpowered, and intimidated.\nAfter breaking both his legs (the barbarian didn't wait for him to refuse to answer a question, just jumped on him.), they got him to calm down the bats by having the party feed them live mice from the coach, and coax the two that lived back into their cages.\n\nIt was the best encounter that we've had so far.  They did a great job.\n\nNow the bard wants to keep the bats as pets.  Now if this was 3.5, I'd have the use handle animal, but they've cut that skill in 4th ed.  Today, I took a look at the book, and made a list of skills that were cut\n\n* Appraise\n* Craft (Many subskills)\n* Decipher Script\n* Disguise\n* Forgery\n* Handle Animal\n* Knowledge (Just the ones not covered already elsewhere)\n* Perform\n* Profession\n* Ride\n* Use Magic Device\n* Use Rope\n\nI'm going to let each of them pick 4 of the out of combat skills, and run it from there.  At least one of them will pick up handle animal I'm sure, and I feel that this gives them more options to use out of combat.  I'll see what they think.\n\nNow, what should I do about the bats?  They are actually pretty strong, especially since there's going to be darkness they can use up ahead for bonus damage.  But they really did work hard to get them, so I want them to be useful.  I'm just not sure about the logistics of keeping bats as pets.\n",

        "text": "And Crumples actually escaped his discipline.  I talked it over with the GM and it would have..  worked badly at multiple levels.  Cest la vie.\n\nThis weeks’ session was awesome, and a two-parter.  We had the players there before the guests, so we fired up a short 'milk run' type. \n\nPhone rings, it’s Mr. Blue, one of our longtime employers.  He’s a little desperate, and he’s short staffed.  Normally he would never call _us_ for a discreet job like this, but he’s short staffed.  One of his executive clients is leaving for a weekend in the Bahamas and he needs temporary security staff to watch the gentleman's pet. \n\nSure, OK.  We meet our point of contact at the mansion, and this is old money - everything is ‘rich’, but it’s conservative and not shiny.  Just the absolute highest quality in the best arrangement possible.  The outbound security guard introduces us to the pet and holy crap it’s a panther.  A full grown, sleek and glossy onyx black murder beast.\n\nOK.  Deep breath.\n\nWe familiarize ourselves with the layout of the place, and Elliot hangs a dozen wee cameras to back up the house’s built in system.  He forts up in the security closet, as far away from the cat as he can get.  \n\nI can’t really blame him.  Hotentote follows the cat into the massive back yard, and I wander around the perimeter.  It’s..  gorgeous.  This is serious high dollar living, and I want some.  Back inside, the cat is trying to explain to Crumbles that the steaks are for _now_ and there are more steaks in the freezer for _Tomorrow_, when the Elliot alerts us to a visitor, and there is a frantic knocking at the front door.  Hotentote makes it there first, and opens it, yelling “GO AWAY” at the hippy outside.  \n\nI interrupt the hippy’s spiel about freeing the “majestic beast of nature” and body-check him down the walk.  I start my own spiel about being a free troll, and a person - capable of making my own decisions, etc, etc, etc. \n\nBefore the hippy notices, he’s been bum rushed out the front gate, which is locked behind him. \n\nHotentote bellows “GET A JOB!” from the house. \n\nAs night falls, we divvy up into shifts and keep watch over a nice boring evening.  \n\nThe next day starts with breakfast.  Real sausages and bacon, made from actual meat.  Real orange juice.  Actual eggs. It’s a culinary marvel, and we actually pass our endurance checks to not have gastrointestinal issues from the unaccustomed bounty.  \n\nThe day starts off nice and slow.  Hotentote is on cat duty, and is taking full advantage of the cat’s fascination with his steak lunch, which Crumples has put in the oven for safe keeping while it warms up.  While they’re faffing about in the kitchen, I’m walking the perimeter and exercising my new Perception skill upgrade.  I notice a shimmering patch on the wall, and as I examine it closer, it disappears. \n\nCurious.  \n\nI call Hotentote over and he can’t see anything in the astral.  He summons a spirit to help run the perimeter, and we hear Crumples screaming.\n\nThat can’t be good.  The screams are coming from the rose garden, so we hustle over there and find Crumples pinned under the cat.  Which is sitting on his head, happy.  \n\nThat’s managed, so we walk the perimeter and find no other signs of infiltration.  A check with Elliot reveals nothing in the Matrix, so..  huh. \n\nLunch time.  The cat’s attention is 100% on the steak, which looks tasty enough that I’m tempted.  But we give it to kitty as intended, and the furball curls up in a ray of sunshine and snores. \n\nIt’s actually boring.  That evening, Crumples gets used as cat furniture, and the rest of us pass the night playing cards and bullshitting.  It’s nice, boring, but nice. \n\nThe only notable event is the cat kicking me off the couch in the middle of the night.  We debrief the returning security guard on Sunday, and..  mosey off home. \n\nThe cat pissed on Crumples duffle bag he was keeping his shiny new assault rifle in. \n\nI’m going to be working this week on the writeup for the ‘rest’ of the session, which was the big finale for our group - we shouldn’t have survived, and I’m astounded we did.

        "text": "On our way to a city museum (with intentions of stealing a relic), our party spotted in the forest below an unusual amount of wolves. Lowering our hippogriph closer, we noticed that the pack of wolves were cornering a small cub of some animal. Feeling something in our hearts, we proceeded to lower one of our party members into the pack via rope, in which we then rescued the poor soul. It should be mentioned that when the startled juvenile clung onto the rescuer PC for its life, it actually did a significant amount of damage. Cradling the animal in a burlap sack while feeding it oats, I then rolled for wisdom, only learn the cub was a (drum roll)\n\nFeral Yowler.\n\nUpon being shown a picture of what a feral yowler looks like, our party was filled with looks of disgust and horror. Our more \"regular\" player suggested we throw the thing off our dang hippogriph to it's death. Foolishly, I defended the thing, saying that we could raise it to be some bad ass mount, or at least sell it. After all, it WAS cuddling me. Much to my \"relief\" my party decided not to kill it. It was only after I went home and cheated by looking up what a feral yowler is, did I realize my mistake.\n\nThis is where I need your help:\n\nNone of us have handle animal.\n\nNone of us are druids.\n\nStill, I personally like the challenge of trying to keep this demonic hell-spawn. Currently, my plans of rehabilitation include dropping it off at a church/temple as a form of \"daycare\", locating a local druid to tame it for us, or taming it myself- as I am a bear monk, and could probably raise it like a normal bear cub.\n\nTL;DR, even though I don't actually NEED help, I would find it interesting to know what you guys would do in this situation.",

Life happened, and it was annoying.\n\n- --\n\nJalees hurried ahead of everyone to the location for the Rat Race. He instructed AnarchMale and AnarchFemale to corral everyone, make sure all the mortals got mind-wiped ( the Prince would later praise him that none of the mortals drown ), then slowly head them over to the Rat Race location. He got to the location, nodded his way past the front guard - still conditioned to accept pretty much anything as ‘normal’ - and made his way up to the 8th floor. \n\nShe was sitting at her desk, as he told her to be. Her pencil skirt was ripped on one side, clean-ish-ly cut on the other. She had found a couple books of matches and what appeared to be cleaning solvents for printers - high alcohol content, a good start. Jalees had had the guard go around and lock every door he possibly could, except the 8th floor stairs door - Jalees would get that when he descended again. He set down a 9mm pistol and three spare mags, loaded with incendiary rounds, and two bags of extremely sharp wooden stakes. He showed her precisely where to aim with them for maximum effect.\n\nJalees talked her through the process once more. Once he left, she should wait for five minutes, and then it was up to her to make it out of the building alive, down to the pay phone, and call the number. He would answer, she would be taken home and left alone. Any other person she encounters intends to kill her. She should attempt to kill them first. She had stopped shaking, she was determined to survive. Jalees left, and locked the 8th floor stair doors behind him.\n\nIn five minutes, the contestants had assembled in the lobby. Jalees explained the current state of the target - moderately armed, probably dangerous. The contestants were to apprehend the target with the minimum possible damage to both the building and to the target. Points would be awarded for speed, but more points for subtlety and precision. Each contestant was then blindfolded, and let loose.\n\nIt was pretty much chaos from there. The contestants weren’t given a chance to scout the building at all nor were they shown a floor plan. A majority of the contestants ridiculously underestimated the target, and would pay for it dearly. What Jalees did not know was that the target had acquired a copy of the master key for the building. She was able to navigate far faster than the contestants, even though they eventually resorted to just forcing the doors to open.\n\nThere are three encounters that the contestants had with the target. First was the Malkavian and one NPC, working together. The target heard them coming up the stairs, retreated onto the 6th floor from the stairs, but couldn’t lock the door quickly enough before the NPC opened it up. She opened with a stake to the chest of the NPC, and succeeded first go ( terribly unlikely, as the dice go ). The Malkavian attempted to use Dementation against her, but was blindfolded ( Dementation requires eye contact ). So the target threw a bottle of rubbing alcohol on them both and tossed in a lit match. Malkavian jumped out the window in fear frenzy, and the NPC burned. ( Jalees hurried over, hearing the commotion, but was unable to save him from death - though not because of the fire. +8xp )\n\nThe second encounter went similarly, stake to the chest (failed), and a followup office worker’s molotov. Those contestants did survive, but elected to remove themselves from the Rat Race.\n\nThe third encounter was the Tremere, who was… probably cheating, but pretty grey. He had used a high level discipline ( Astral Projection ) to scout the building up and down, and watch the target for a while before going after her. He carefully approached her from behind, caught her hands behind her, and slowly hauled her down the stairs, fighting against her fear-empower struggling all the way. He actually made it all the way to the ground floor, and out into the lobby before things went badly.\n\nTremere hauled her to her feet right in front of Jalees, claimed the win, and then let her go. This presented her the opportunity to spin around with a stake hidden in her sleeve, and get him good. Then she ran, quite literally for her life. It hadn’t been long enough for Jalees to summon the rest of the contestants down, but there were a few vampires there that started to take up the chase before Jalees shouted them down.\n\nThe target made it to the phone, and dialed the number. She was bleeding, with a broken arm and heavily bruised leg, burns across her back (botched a molotov), and quaking in fear and adrenaline. Jalees answered, and told her that someone would collect her shortly, and take her anywhere, after a visit to a quiet doctor. She thanked him, he hung up.\n\nThe contestants were all rounded up, minus one who had sadly underestimated the target and had ashed (Final Death, older vampires turn to dust) “due to the fire”. Jalees had a short statement in this event, and delivered it perfectly:\n\n&gt;Jalees:”This is a reminder to all of us that we are not infallible, we are not invincible. Mortals can injure us, they can even kill us if properly prepared. With mortals, as with any opponent, caution is advised - even when it seems unnecessary. We know neither when nor how we will be tested, and should treat every challenge as such.”\n\nThat sobered the gathering somewhat. As they remembered the fallen NPC, AnarchMale and AnarchFemale got everyone moving and headed back to the party, where the winner was announced for Jacques Costeau, and the news of yet more deaths or disappearances was passed around. The party quickly grew sombre after that, and resultantly ended about three hours before sunrise.\n\nJalees visited the target and fed her some of his blood, making her into his (second) ghoul. She recovered rapidly, and her family never worried for money from then on. She was known as “Abdul-Shula” (apologies for terrible romanization, roughly ‘Servant of Fire’), but since no one else could pronounce it, she became “Shelly”. She appreciated it as much as Jalees appreciated ‘Jack’.\n\nThe Prince was pleased with Jalees for picking such a good target for the Rat Race, and was not surprised in the least when she appeared again as his ghoul. She would serve Jalees well over the next few years, and he kept her family from harm. Mostly - but that’s another story.\n\nThe players were especially troubled by these events, shaken by an NPC being taken out by a mortal - “a little human woman, of all things!” They were foolish, and perhaps had begun to realise it. They forgot it almost as quickly, as the next plotline started up and we were in for a world of strange.\n\n* [next &gt;&gt;](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2hsvke/vampiretm_john_randoms_revenge_part_7_mediumnew/)",

Great....the cult's slowly taking over the region.\n\nTo make things worse the local duke is working for them! And he controls a massive fortress/keep/town that sits on a mesa near a local mountain range making it hard to move around the area with out the Bandits/Cults/Duke's agents spotting them. \n\nLuckilly for them they find out a handful of the local nobels are fightin back and they get in good with them, gaining access to a series of secret tunnels below the mesa that were used to prevent sieges. The group desides to make a raid on the Duke's keep to get intel on the Cults activities and maybe secure supplies for their allies in the revolution.\n\nInside they creep around looking for people only to discover the keep mostly empty. They stumble across a number of sacrifical altars to Lamastu and find out the Duke is dead! Replaced by a Cultist working for the Lord of Slaughter (one of the heads of the local cult.) They make a quick choice and decide to pull back. They don't have the firepower to take out the pretender or his allies. However....oh my there is a LOT of good stuff laying around.\n\nWhile they they find a Gnome prisoner, soon to be sacrifice, called Vookie. He's a...he claims freelance merchant...but he's basically a thief. He agrees to work for them if they'll protect him. They accept his terms and suddenly the group has their mascot character. Vookie shows them to the Duke's hidden rooms and they break into a locked chamber and find SILVER. For some reason the duke has been piling up silver weapons, sliverware, all jewerlry, etc of Silver nature.\n\nThey don't put 2 and 2 together right away but start collecting the silver. It's then they are jumped by the guards. A pair of heavy figthers who transform into werewolves! They are backed up by some goons (bandits) who shift into wererats.\n\nThe team discovers their weapons are...less then effective. What follows is a few rounds of cussing and trying to disarm and grapple weremonsters. Then Vookie proving his worth finds knives and a sword in the silver pile an tosses it to the group. The fight ends shortly there after and everyone agress Vookie is getting a 10% cut of profits. They pile up the gear and smash out through a 1st floor window. They can't go back through the way they came in (would give it away).\n\nThe next few minutes is the group wooping and hollering as they seperate and lead the corrupt city guard through a series keystone cop sequences. Operation \"Cheese It\" becomes SOP from that point foward. They exit the city through various means and meet up with Vookie at an old theives hideaway. They pass out the silver and head back to their tower to melt it down and sliverize their gear.\n\nWord is passed to the revolutionaries that they are going to locate the Cult's leader the Lord of Slaughter, and get allies. They just fail to mention they pocked a few hundred gold of stuff in doing so. They do however pass along some silver weapons to the revolutionaries and tell them to start stockpiling more.\n\nNext time \"I slept with what?!\" or Drunken Monk Batman get's it on.",

This is a recap of the last part of our last session! Dialog is as close as I can remember. I'm posting from mobile so hopefully no formatting errors!\n__________________________________________________________________________________\n\nThe brilliant light from the portal withdrew back to the nothingness in stutters and spurts, playing havoc with his vision. He hadn't been diced into a million pieces, flung into the depths of the void, or dropped into a volcano. That was a good start. His armour was intact, he had his swords. He could work with that.\n\nHe felt sick though, his stomach churning. Likely the aftereffects of teleportation. But wait, there was a flicker of something. A lingering on the air. That smell. Not him. Not Good. It invaded his nostrils, like black smoke. Then it hit like a sledgehammer. Undead. Evil. Everywhere.\n\nThey were surrounded. The portal had closed, the light fading, only now did he see the cavern. Ranks of undead filled the space, armed and unnaturally still. Waiting for something?\n\n\nCaelen had moved to Victarion's side. 'We knew Benny was trying to herd us through the portal, but not to kill us. Why would he bring us here?' His eyes flickered over the horde. 'And why haven't they attacked?'\nVictarion shook his head. 'It does not matter now. This is an abomination.'\nThe others pulled close, readying their weapons. They were warriors, tried and tested. But they weren't bound by the oaths he was. They could leave this place and still be true to themselves. He couldn’t.\n\nHe drew Brightstar, the steel whispering softly as it slid free of the sheath. Victarion reversed his grip, planting the blade point first into the rock. Closing his eyes, he took a knee. \n'Dawnflower, Goddess of light. We walk through the darkness, whilst our enemies surround us. I humbly ask for the strength to do what must be done. In your name.'\nThe sword ignited, a corona of fire wreathing the blade. Around him the shadows danced.\n\n\n\nAs Victarion stood, the silence was broken; laughter echoed around the cave. The silent ranks parted, and all eyes were drawn to the approaching figure. A hood obscured the face, robes that flowed to the ground sliding over the slate like oil on water. The figure raised its arms, and lowered its hood.\n\nBenny.\n\n'Very good, very good!' his voice was high, almost to the point of laughter. 'It took me a while, but now you're here. You don't ever make it easy do you? But I have some good news...My master wants to meet you! So if you'll all kindly follow me?' he gestured behind him.\n\nVictarion heard the others shuffling around. Fletch, ever mild mannered spoke up. 'Victarion. We can't win this. It might be better if we go with him.'\n\n'you've lost every time we've met.' Benny chortled. 'why would now be any different?'\n\n'He's right... you know.' Shadowbrow's husky voice came from behind. 'Think of the big picture! How can we stop the Third Living War if we die in a cave?'\n\n\n*Think of the big picture.*\n\n\n*He thought back to the graveyard. The thunder above, the stillness below. He had been a different man then, and had worshipped a different God. In his mind's eye he saw the warrior pinned beneath him take his final breath. A rattling, shuddering thing that no man deserved to be gifted. Storms! Neither of them deserved this. He had allowed pride and arrogance to dictate his actions. He had walked right up to the brink, and let Benny push him off into the abyss.*\n\n*The storm broke, and a single ray of light pierced the gloom.*\n\n*It hit him like a thunderbolt, the pain racking his body. he heard the words, felt the power leaving his body. Victarion. Oathbreaker. pelor would no longer be there for him. He had spat upon the oaths he had sworn. Allowed himself to be used by darker powers. Never again. He would wield the light no more.*\n\n\nAcross the room, he found Benny's eyes.\n\n'If you really knew me, you'd know that's no choice at all.'\n\nBenny shook his head softly. 'very well then. Well if you 'adventurers' wouldn't mind coming right this way.' He stood expectantly.\n\nThe others shuffled past awkwardly. Tyrone was the last. 'Brother', he implored. 'I know we've been through some scraps. But this is suicide. Please, you've got to reconsider.'\n\nVictarion smiled within his helm. 'I have broken oaths in the past, and been granted forgiveness. I will not throw that away.'\n\n\nSmiling sadly, Tyrone turned and strode towards the others.\n\n'I will not go quietly into the dark.' He whispered to himself. The ranks closed around him. He raised brightstar.\n\n",

        "text": "The first RPG I ever played was 40K's Rouge Trader. This was my first so naturally my favorite RPG game. My character was named Nathan Zachary (props if you get the reference) a former squadron commander in the imperium navy turned smuggler after his life went to shit. Anyways Nathan was essentially Han Solo in 40K in fact his best friend was actually an Ork named Grok (another player character). Long story short he was a Void Master (pilot) a drunk, a wise ass, a smuggler, a scoundrel, and all around pure neutral character. \n\nAnyway ones one of my favorite stories from rouge trader was the time I managed to kill 50 men without firing a single bullet. It started with us getting a call from our Rouge Trader: Tarron Damos one of the angriest men in the history of the 40K universe. His shouts could level mountains, and his eye were filled with a rage that would make even Khorne himself shy away in fear. He told us that we were to go to a prison planet and find the man known as the Warden, and that's about it. I had only just joined this crew of veterans, Orks, Kroots, and other colorful people. We collected our gear and proceeded to the hanger bay where I took the co-pilot seat rather than the pilots seat and we made our way down to the Prison planet. \n\nOur Approach to the prison was met with flak cannon fire and anti-air defenses. Our NPC pilot was doing whatever he could but one shot of the cannon managed to blow his brains all over the upholstery and my face. Doing what I could half-blind from the blood in my eyes (and working with a bad roll and slightly better re-roll)  I managed to put us on the ground in a method that I can only describe as turning our drop ship into modern art on landing. I was unconscious all the other  NPCs were dead on impact fortunately the other characters survived. After a few rounds of puking, and being dazed we managed to pull ourselves together and at least survey the area. The Ship was in crater everyone had jet lag, and I was just being made fun of because my piloting was shit (it was slightly above average but I made a mistake in character creation and allocated the wrong points to the wrong attribute and this was like my third time playing).\n\nAs we surveyed the location which was essentially the square of a prison city, our Archmilitant named Faux Shot stated that we should get moving as the sounds of a crashing aircraft would attract the attention of the prisoners. We began to pack up any supplies we could, leaving our dead guardsmen (there's a surprise) in the ship still attached to their seat belts. As we were about to leave our ork Grok notices a  box leading to the PA system of the prison. SOMEHOW! He manages to hack it and tests the system with  view taps then suddenly WAGHHHHHHHHHHHSSSSS!!! At the top of his spore filled lungs into the mic and it resonates throughout the entire prison. This led to me and several others  to tackle the ork in a vain attempt that was honestly far to late to stop. \n\nSuddeny in all four directions we here the sounds of yelling and anger as well as some gun shots that some how the prisoners got. Before we knew it we were surrounded by at least 200 prisoners (Represented by little D6s our GM haphazardly threw onto the mat). So we began to take cover behind the wreckage our landing provided and began to fire back. They slowly made their approach when someone threw a flash bang at the south side blinding several of prisoners. Seeing this as a golden oppurtunity to be that guy who actually things I proceeded to yell out at the blind Prisoners.  \"They're trying to flank us, quick shoot behind you!\"  One of the assholes despite being blind managed to nick my shoulder but the armor abosrbed it (Bad roll). I growled and yelled out again  \"Assholes, I said behind you!\" This time the prisoners turned around and began shooting at each other and resulted in the 50 prisoners dead from friendly fire.After that we made our retreat from the prisoners and escaped\n\nAnd that's the story of how I killed 50 men without firing a single shot.\n",

        "text": "Drendl Drang summoned four Pathfinders to the forgotten estate of a banished Chelish family to recover some documents detailing what Chelish spies know about Absalom's city defenses.  The adventure went well for us as we wasted all her mercs and avoided all the traps on the way down.  Finally we reached the crypt and past that the family vaults. \nWe made a deal with the few remaining goons and they deserted after a brief skirmish with hapless skeletons. Outside the door we stopped and used all our buffs.  We cast Haste, Bless, etc. I chugged potions until my Slayer was a bloated fleshy siege engine.  Bull strength, shield, barkskin, the whole nine yards.\nWe opened the door and spotted a hellhound and the traitor herself!  The DM called for initiatives.\nWe rolled rocks, even with my plus ten I got a 12 and she and the hound went first.  The hound delayed and she cast black tentacles, we all failed the DC 30 Reflex and were grappled then the hound breathes fire and because we were all grappled  it negated our reflex save and we took full damage. Let me reiterate: black *expletive deleted* tentacles, hellhound reinserts and breath weapon.  Cheap DM dick-baggery. \nSo this epic boss fight quickly degraded into a bizarre tentacle hentai, delete your browser type scene while she enjoyed full cover from ranged attacks behind a bookcase.  We immediately lobbed fuse grenades, alchemist fires, fireballs, scorching rays, thunderstones etc. anything AOE to deal splash damage or disrupt her casting.  This was only moderately effective.  However with some cooperative maneuvers and smart casting and admittedly some meta-gaming we subdued her and her \"violate party\" spell ended. It is in the aftermath of this ordeal we begin to realize our folly.  The library was a wreak. Toppled and scorched bookcases, blackened unreadable books and nearly every scrap of unbound parchment was cinders in the now settling sooty dust.  The sorceresses clothes and backpack were charred rags and heat warped bronze buckles.  She had already retrieved the documents in question and was on her way out.\nTo be fair the DM showed us the exact text that \"any fire damage dealt to her at all will destroy the documents and result in failure if the mission\".  The secondary success condition was directly related to returning with the documents so we failed that as well by default.  We all agreed that we had so utterly failed that not prestige should be rewarded.  ",

        "text": "* [glossary](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2h8xzq/vampiretm_john_randoms_revenge_glossary/)  \n\nI don’t have any of the chat logs, but I have all of the action logs - this game was played over an odd arrangement of IRC channels - one was for dialogue, one was for rolling/taking actions, a third was OOC, and everyone had a private line to the ST ( I assume ). Between upgrades and random crap cleanup, I seem to have lost a majority of the chat logs, but kept or restored a majority of the action and ooc logs. Oddly, the private ST chat I have 95% of the logs for.\n- - -\nTonight, the Anarch State Fair started, and Jalees was one of the first in line. There were a few ‘watering holes’, consisting of willing human blood sources of differing appeals, gambling tables for money, minor favors, ghouls, land, etc., as well as a few booths of one type or another. The two biggest attractions were the sign-ups for the two Anarch Games; A Vamp could only participate in one or the other, “any kindred whose name appears on both lists would be ineligible of competing in either” was a good way of keeping the others in line. Each game was explained in brief - one was to test the ability to hunt without the use of sight, and the other was to test a vamp’s strength and speed. The games would start just before midnight, and it was determined that Jalees was to judge them.\n\nJalees accepted in an appropriate mix of honor and surprise, and wandered around the fair a bit before being pulled aside by AnarchMale and AnarchFemale to have the games explained to him. Really, though, they were just handing him the signup sheets and asking what to do next. Jalees instructed them to find one mortal - a new mortal - for each person on the Jacques Costeau list, and he would handle the Rat Race contestant.\n\nThe PCs partook of the party, both in the variety of the humans to drink from and the conversation with what appeared to be a far larger majority of the Domain attending than a normal Elysium. There were a few younger members missing, Anarch and Camarilla alike, which gave the party an edge of paranoia and fear. Jalees did his best to comfort those expressing misgivings, partially by taking blame for sending a couple of the missing members out for more refreshments, which helped to calm the party, but could only dull the edge, not remove it. Eventually some of the missing members did come back, shifting the balance slightly in favor of the Anarchs.\n\nJalees had, in fact, sent out a few younger Cam members to hunt for an office building, preferably one where there was someone working particularly late and had few night guards. One of them signaled him, and he left the PCs to mull about the party to set up the Rat Race. The office building was a standard concrete slab affair, smallish windows, thick walls, more like a prison than an office. There was one light still on on one of the higher floors, and just the guard at the desk to worry over. Jalees had one of the ventrue of the Domain go in and chat up the guard, lay down Dominate commands to prevent the guard from alerting the police that night.\n\nJalees walked in, took the stairwell to the proper floor, and Obfuscated to the lit cubicle. He made a small sound to cause the contestant to turn around, waited a beat until she was looking completely his way, and dropped Obfuscate. “She nearly wet herself”, I was told. Jalees explained to her, in a calm, comforting way, exactly what was going to happen that night, and that there was absolutely nothing she could do to prevent or alter it. She was thoroughly convinced. She was instructed to prepare herself, with two hours to gather any materials she needed, and probably fifteen minutes until the competitors would make it up to her floor. She must begin the game from her cubicle, but otherwise had no other restrictions on her actions. Her goal was to leave the premises, and call a phone number from a specific pay phone down the street. If she could do that, she was safe - at least from his kind - and would never have to do this again. She would be also be compensated according to how well she did. If she died, her family would receive her full life insurance, perhaps more.\n\nBefore Jalees left, he apologised to her. She believed him. More importantly, so did the other players.\n\nEven though he is good, Jalees could not be in two places at once. As he was supposed to judge both games, it was determined that the games would happen sequentially, instead of in parallel. “Clearly an oversight on the part of the Anarchs”, the Prince complained to the PCs and Jalees, barely loud enough for them to hear.\n\nJalees decided that the Jacques Costeau game would be first. He did, after all, give the competitor of Rat Race two hours, and it hadn’t been even close to one. Though he did not particularly bother to notice the lives of humans, he did attempt to keep his promises when reasonable.\n\nIn the beginning, there were ten contestants. Two dropped out as soon as they heard the rules. Only seven actually made it into the water, one decided that the bay was “too unclean” to risk. Jalees made sure to send a couple of particularly strong vamps down to bring those three up immediately - they were still wet from putting them at the bottom anyways. The mortals had each gotten a diving tank with 5 minutes of air that had a number painted on in luminescent oil-based paint. Each contestant was given a number that matched. First one back with their human still breathing wins.\n\nBrujah and Ventrue were contents in this game, and I think Brujah ended up winning, Ventrue in third or fourth place. Two of the contestants hadn’t made it out in 5 minutes, so the previous strong vamps went back in to dredge them out. When they came back, mortals alive and in tow, but lacking the other contestants, NPCs got jumpy. The players were confused, and metagamed a bit about what could have happened to the other contestants. Vampires don’t need air, so drowning was out. The bay was man made after the Vietnam conflict ( I don't remember the exact year ), so no chance of mines or traps. Too far north for crocodiles, alligators or any other sort of creature that could cause a problem. They eventually decided on “the NPCs must have botched rolls really bad”, and let it be.\n\nBecause there couldn’t possibly have been bear traps linked to steel cages filled with stakes on the bay floor, right? Jalees would collect them later, and get 30 XP and 9th generation out of them.\n\n* [ next &gt;&gt; ](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2hli1t/vampiretm_john_randoms_revenge_part_6_long/)",

        "text": "Disclaimer - This journal contains spoilers for the plot of [AEG's World's Largest Dungeon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World's_Largest_Dungeon) The wiki purports the existence of other blogs dedicated to similar purposes but a casual Google search was unable to locate any honest, unbiased accounts of the events described in the adventure. While this is a home-brew campaign borrowing elements from more than one universe or SRD I do use the WLD as my primary guideline and build the rest of my campaign world out from there. Continue reading at your discretion.\n\nSession One: In which the Dungeon Master introduces himself, tells a tale of humble beginnings, and drops a few major spoilers for an eleven year old adventure written for a system that technically no one uses anymore.\n\n[Read Session Two](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2hy8tm/diary_of_a_dungeon_master_session_two_dramatis/)\n\nThe idea for this diary sprung fully formed from my forehead in the wee hours of one drizzly Sunday morning in September, as most good ideas are wont to do, and it took until the grey break of dawn for me to fabricate the words you are now reading. So I say Good Morning to you Dear Readers! My name is MisterStevo, and I am here now to tell you a little about myself. For you see, I am a Dungeon Master, but more importantly I am a storyteller. I have of course been many other things throughout my life but predominantly as I look back I see patterns of recollection and fabrication, of twisting tales and sometimes complex webs of deceit and misinformation.\n\nFret not, Dear Reader, and cease your worries for my precious moral fortitude, for these slanders of honesty were made solely for the purposes of entertainment. I have always sought to delight and educate with story, fact or fiction, tall or short, it has long been my pleasure to entertain an audience, be it singular or many. To provoke certain thought, to guide readers or listeners along the pathways of legend and explore the reaching possibilities, a multiverse of infinite intertwining imagination.\n\nIt was only fitting then that I gravitated towards role-playing. It started innocently enough. A chat room called the Red Dragon Inn, one of the first of its kind, introduced me to a world of fantasy that I could control. Honing my young imagination as well as my budding writing craft in those years I was as thoroughly green as I could be, but cementing those late night AOL binges were plenty daytime adventures. \n\nAD&amp;D and 2nd Edition had been the staple of tabletop role-playing since the dawn of time, as far as I was concerned. That my friends and I did our tabletop gaming outside on the sidewalk was completely besides the point, I only mean to establish to the audience that I knew what my THAC0 was. But when 3rd edition dropped everything changed. The rules were streamlined and the numbers compressed, they became easier to comprehend; and as I played, learned, and saw the way new system began to unfold I found an appreciation for how those numbers shaped the way the story played out.\n\nThe first campaign I ever ran myself was, even up to present day, my most successful and it took my players from first through eleventh level. My turn at the helm was our first departure from the guy who had been up until then our most solid DM, after having several rotating positions all around the group for years before that. After my run we began a cycle of rotating DMs so everyone would get a chance to both play and contribute to running the story, and it was during this time I got the first idea for the universe I wanted all my fantasy campaigns to take place in.\n\nYou see, at the time I had just worked my way through a series of books called the Renshai Chronicles, which wove a medieval/magical fantasy world around the Norse pantheon, my personal favorite, but cast the titanic forces of nature that were the Aesir in the role of maintaining the precarious balance of forces in the universe. I was especially enchanted with how the author wrote her Loki, this was long before Marvel's Cinematic universe made the comic book character so popular, and is based heavily on the original prose where Loki is more on par in terms of power - and is blood brothers - with Odin, not Thor. I admired the way the author made it so he had always been aware of his ultimate fate, he knew of the unfolding events that would lead to his ultimate imprisonment, torture, escape and demise having caused Ragnarok, the Death of the Gods.\n\nIn this story Loki followed the footsteps of fate willingly, chose to become the strongest personification of chaos and evil in all the worlds in order to set Ragnarok in motion and wipe the slate clean. Though he was far from the main character, by the end of the series it was clear to me it had been Loki's job to bring ultimate balance to the universe, to be that polarizing force of change to wipe away the stagnant and corrupt system that had persisted for thousands of years. Which was a great point for me to jump off of. During that time in college I was writing a paper for my mythology class on the importance of Loki and the trickster archetype, and I began to slowly roll out plans for the backdrop of an epic story of my own.\n\nIt was late in the year two thousand four, shortly after my birthday when I learned about it. A company called AEG had put out a d20 supplement to the 3rd edition rule set, which at the time was just about transitioning into 3.5 so there were conversion sheets flying all over the place and I was being sure to stay on top of the changes, which looked promising. The book they published was a massive 800 page tome, a single adventure they had dubbed the World's Largest Dungeon. *I must have it,* I thought. *It will be mine.*\n\nAnd it was. For a crisp hundo and change I had become master of a guide for ultimate adventure, a campaign purported to sport \"every monster in the manual\". I talked up the adventure to my group for weeks while I saved my pennies and waited for shipping and processing. This thing was gigantic, easily the largest book on my shelf and triple the girth of any single source-book released up until then, I tore into it hungrily. All the while promising my group wonderful adventures to come.\n\nIt took a month to read through this monster, it claimed to have enough content for two years of weekly sessions. The whole of the dungeon was split into sixteen distinct regions , and each region had a fully colored and detailed foldout poster map (Regions A through O, with two maps for Region N which I learned was the thematic climax of the adventure.) Each chapter of the book was an intricately detailed floor plan of each room, every encounter, all the treasure and loot. It also set up a detailed back-story, a history for the dungeon that they designed to fit into nearly any campaign, as well as several adventure hooks for working it into an existing story or to entice new adventurers to plumb its depths.\n\nI will go into greater detail of the actual established plot and a summary of the four dimensional layout of the dungeon itself in a later entry. Suffice to say, as an eternal prison for the worst evils imaginable it was obvious to me that the ravages of time and logical progression of events were putting tremendous strain on the garrison of angels and archons sworn to stand eternal vigil over the formerly imprisoned population of demons and devils, now freed from captivity but unable to actually leave the complex, as well as the encroaching breach of underdark creatures left to worm and wriggle their way into any new niche and now finding themselves trapped in the middle of the single oldest struggle between the forces of good and evil, the layered magic of the complex able to sustain nearly every terrible form of life and un-life. For a person predisposed to grand, epic storytelling it was clear there was only a few ways I could handle an adventure of this magnitude and also make it fun for everyone involved.\n\nBut as seems to be the norm in my life, good plans never seem to come together because it's important to note at this point that I didn't get to start running this adventure in the fall and winter of two thousand five. No my gaming group dissolved thanks to a few ungrateful douche bags who will go unnamed, and I was forced to sit on the World's Largest waste of time and money for a little over ten years, all the while refreshing myself of its pages, tweaking bits of the plot in my mind, solidifying my pantheon and filling out the details of the aftermath of my own Ragnarok, one where Odin falls as it is written, but Loki survives through a cunning manipulation of fate and reality, and becomes a driving force in rebuilding the balance and protecting the world that comes after; across the chessboard from his brother's mighty son, and two other deities powerful enough to have survived The Purge; Loki's Ragnarok was not just the death of Norse Gods, he helped make it a multiverse spanning extermination of all deities everywhere. Anybody who's familiar with the 3rd edition rules on domains and divine ranks and the specific manner deities have their stat blocks laid out might have an idea of where this is headed.\n\nSo the universe is torn asunder, metaphysically speaking. A hole is ripped between all dimensions and realities containing copies of all of the known pantheons. Norse, Greek, Egyptian, Indian, Faerun, Ravenloft, Golarion, Every mythical being and every unspoken legend, every forgotten horror of the deep scattered and destroyed in the ensuing overflow of chaos. With the borders between all copies of all planes of existence torn apart many beings of phenomenal power are unmade, and places like the outer elemental planes and the lower/higher energy planes crash into and merge with the other copies, becoming prime planes of existence. Its the Material plane that reacts the most violently to the Purge, leaving behind only one copy of one world broadly defined enough to shoehorn in anything I need or my players want to include. Surrounding that are the requisite number of aforementioned expanded prime outer planes composing the known cosmos, watched over and protected from the empty space outside reality by four divine figures wielding the combined proportional weight of every abandoned domain, every unoccupied mantle of power left behind in the cataclysm.\n\nAnd of course the Dungeon survives the whole debacle, somehow unaffected by the primordial cosmic upheaval. Perhaps its the one thing across all possible realities that never changes. Every permutation of every possible universe always sees the forces of unwavering goodness attempting to lock away and forget about the most vile forces of evil, without fail. But now the bindings anchoring those titanic forces of darkness firmly on the far side of mortal understanding are more jacked up than ever. And the new Gods in town, though they may not have been the ones to create the dungeon certainty have a full understanding of it's purpose and condition. What the dungeon needed, I would often find myself thinking, was a good cleansing. And now, about a thousand years or so after the Purge, when the chaotic balance of their new world is finally beginning to ebb towards a calmer cycle, we find an environment rife to be filled with true heroes.\n\nIt would need to be the most epic of lawful aligned campaigns, culminating in the final titanic struggle between good and evil, an old redressing of balance, the cleansing of a corrupt institution. I knew I was going to have to carefully handpick my PCs and make sure they all knew the score going in. I thought about it from the players perspective. I was familiar with the Legend of Drizzt and I knew what happened to even the brightest of souls in the underdark, recesses and cave systems tucked hundreds or thousands of miles under the surface. I knew what lurked in the caverns deeper than any sane creature has a right to go. It would take time. They would need to be guided, molded, destined for this task.\n\nWith the advent of 4th Edition I thought for sure I would never get the chance to run my pride and joy, 4ed was just too different from 3rd or 3.5 to warrant translation, and while there was nothing wrong with the old books they had seemed to fade from living memory, either that or it was because I had to put on a tie, tuck my shirt in and work for a living and I suddenly found myself without the time for games. Eventually though after many, many years of tweaking plots and machinations in the back of my head Pathfinder finally brought peace to the world, and in my search for the right combination of crazy and stupid I was finally able to assemble a party of stalwart adventurers; for purposes of bringing light to the dark places time has forgotten and slaying evils so terrible the world never knew they existed. This past Friday the 19th of September was that parties twelfth gaming session. Three month of solid dedication from players both veteran and newb alike, they've just cleared Region C and made it to seventh level.\n \nHerein to follow is a chronicle of the adventure and its players, an account of the settlement of discrepancies due to translation between systems, including a summary of the style in which I run my games, and an overview of the Introduction, Prologue, and First Ten Days inside the Dungeon Proper. Stay tuned for Session Two: Dramatis personae, dynamics of the perfect party.\n\nedit: paragraphs and words",

        "text": "Some time over a month ago, the group I'm in now started our Pathfinder campaign. It was supposed to be weekly, but some time constraints got in the way, so we're only on our fourth session. [I wrote about the first time here, if you're interested.](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2dht9x/pathfinder_how_our_first_real_fight_showed_us_how/).\n\nQuick team rundown. \nStan the Rat: Ratfolk alchemist, drug addict, the party leader for no justifiable reason.\nNekhen (I could have sworn it was Nekhet but I've been corrected): Tengu witch that makes fantastic intimidate rolls and wears no clothes. Is basically built to be a necromancer.\nGleep: Grippli gunslinger that pretends she can't speak Common just to fuck with us. Thankfully took the rapid reload feat.\nDindeep: Gnome summoner with a ferret-like eidolon that she always rides. Charismatic, good at pulling off badass moves. \nZeravica, or Z: Dwarf fighter, one of the only reasons we've survived at this point, inexplicably lucky with acrobatics checks and has thus been named the \"anti-gravity dwarf\".\n\n\nSo there we are, exploring some ruins of an abandoned Dwarven town Why, you ask? Same reason anyone would: to find mushrooms! (That's why people go there, right?) These mushrooms are the last ingredient needed to make a cure for a plague that, at this point, has probably totally annihilated the town it's in. The fact that we rested for four days at one tree alone speaks volumes about the pace and seriousness at which we have been taking this quest.\n\nAt this point we've explored all but two rooms in this pretty large dwarven complex. We choose the nearest room, and in it, basking in the sunlight from a huge hole in the ceiling, is a decently sized warg. It's even bigger to us because our tallest is 5 feet and 2 inches. The warg gives a dramatic \"why have you woken us from our slumber?\" routine and we're pretty intimidated. Stan pushes Dindeep to the front of the group because she's literally the only one with worthwhile charisma. \n\n\"Uh,\" she says, \"just looking for some mushrooms. Kind of rare, really good for medicine. We found a couple around here but we need more.\"\n\"Ah, yes, I know of these.\" The warg steps to the side, revealing a large cluster of these mushrooms in the far corner of the room. \"I would be willing to part with these if I get something in return. On the other side of this building, in what was once a library, are two darkmantles hiding, waiting for prey to amb-\"\n\"Oh, those?\" Stan pipes up. \"Yeah, killed 'em.\"\n\"...You did?\" The warg frowned.\n\"Yep. That's why I have these.\" Stan pointed to circular cuts all over his face. \"Got grappled.\"\n\"I see.. There is also a giant spider in the tower on the north-\"\n\"Smashed it with a hammer.\" Z shrugged. \n\"Right. Uh... Want to kill some bats?\" The warg sighed.\n\"Haven't killed bats yet,\" Stan mentioned. \"Let's go, guys. We'll be back, big wolfy guy.\" As usual, everyone follows the alchemist with impulse control problems.\n\nOn the way to find the bats, we stumble upon a few dwarven skeletons that get up and start coming at us. Instead of just yelling at them like she does everything else, Nekhen takes control of two of them and convinces the other one to follow her even though it rolled a good save against her powers. At this point, Dindeep stops us.\n\"Guys, wait. You realize the wolf is gonna try to eat us after we get back?\"\n\"Whaaat?\" Stan again. \"Why would he do that?\"\n\"He's a warg.\"\n\"Good point.\"\n\nWe try to figure out how we might kill him and take his stuff, but nobody has any good plans, mostly because our normal fighting style was the \"Disjointed and Messy\" technique, and even in that we were probably white belts. Not to mention this was a big, vicious beast that probably knew how to fight. Finally, Stan (who, by the way, is me. Don't know if I've mentioned that) has a lightbulb go off.\n\n\"What do we have? Like, let's pool our resources together and see what we come up with.\"\nIn the end, the plan was this. \n1.Nekhen uses Enlarge Person on one skeleton and sends all three in first as a distraction, since they keep talking about wanting to die in battle anyway. Dwarves, man, what can you do? \n2. Gleep poisons some magical crossbow bolts we have that burst into flame on impact. We weren't sure if we could but the rule of cool won this fight, so poison firebolts they became. Stan, Dindeep, and Z all have crossbows so even though the poison won't compound, if they all land it'll do a good amount of damage.\n3. During the fight, Gleep will just stand back and shoot when possible. Benefits of rapid reloading. If melee is too tight, then she'll just get to a better vantage point.\n4. Stan will, after firing a poison firebolt, go gather the mushrooms and then use a potion of Expeditious Retreat to promptly gtfo.\n\nAnd thus began our rite of passage into partydom.\n\nThe skeletons charge in and... Nothing. Why is the room empty? Well, it isn't. The warg was hiding behind the doors. It takes down the enlarged skeleton immediately. Plan is already failing, yay! But two out of three crossbow bolts hit and do a decent amount of damage. However, Gleep keeps missing. The warg is able to land a hit on one of the skeletons and take its arm off, and probably a couple ribs too. But then the magic happens.\n\nTo hit on one-armed skeleton roll: nat 20. Roll to confirm: nat 20. Damage: I don't remember the number but it's a ton. Not enough to kill it, so we decided it went down as this: The skeleton with both arms does a one-two punch, knocking the warg toward good ol' one-arm, and onesy over there goes Beatrix Kiddo on its ass and *rips its fucking eye out*. \n\nAfter taking a couple hits from Dindeep and her ferret friend, the warg decides none of this is worth it and tries to run, when suddenly-\n\nIt's dead. Z has sunk her shiny new hand axe she found earlier straight into its skull. Attacks of opportunity, baby. And I/Stan didn't even have to use the potion.\n\nI'm sure there have been cooler fights out there, but for a newer player like me, the criticals turning a wounded, weak little skeleton goon into a badass powerhouse was awesome. This was also the first time where all of us were useful in a fight. Before that it was terrible rolls, near death experiences, grapples, or all of the above.\n\nSpeaking of terrible rolls, we figured out how many people in this small town of about 1500 would have died from this plague while we took almost two weeks to do a quest that could have been done in a few days, and thanks to bad rolls in counting that, only about 130 or 140 died. Suck it, plague!\n",

        "author": "Malphia",
        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2h9u9v/penelope_the_good_succubus_part_2_killing_the_bad/",
        "text": "[Part 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2g155n/penelope_the_good_succubus_part_1/)\n\nIt was probably another 10 minutes game time when the flying equestrian came flying back with three hysterical girls. Most of the hysteria came from Melinda as she babbled about her master killing her copy. Cortanna wanted to just hit the road, explaining that a guy named Szen tried killing Melinda. She said it was pointless to fight him for he was in cahoots with Erythnul and had the town on his side.\n\nNow as for Penelope. she’s aware of the mark of Erythnul and the role Ărajă was to play in destroying him. So when she heard that some guy was working for him, she craved to destroy the evil man (for that’s what her parents taught and did. Evil things were to be destroyed). Sanji expressed that fighting him now would be smart since the wizard apparently had used a high level spell to disintegrate Melinda’s copy.\n\nWhile Cortanna and Sanji debated, Penelope remembered Luggage. During the fight, with the ooze, Goblins, and Braxats, the half elf had asked the luggage for a wand of healing. Penelope asked what all he carried only to hear that they didn’t know. He apparently was filled with stuff. So as the wizard and half elf bickered on the hillside they were at, Penelope went a bit of a distance away before calling Luggage over. She was wondering if the creature had any weapons in it’s depths, and noting how he spat stuff out, she didn’t want someone in the party to get hit by a flying sword. Plus if Luggage had weapons, then maybe there would be some strong stuff for the group to use.\n\n“Luggage, empty all your weapons out,” the succubus instructed. Luggage seemed to heave a great sigh, but obediently opened it’s mouth and purged the items that Penelope requested.\n\nApproximately 5 minutes of weapons spewed from the depths of the luggage down the hillside, marring the earth along their descent. Swords, maces, hammers, morning stars, spiked chains, halberds, scythes (you get the picture) of all sizes as well as unusual weapons like flying disks, a battleship, ballistas, and bombs (that detonated in the midst of all the weapons that had fallen before them... oops). \n\nPenelope looked on with a giddiness appropriate for a child waking up Christmas morning. When the fires subsided and the last ring of metal against metal echoed away, the chiding began. Mainly the women were upset that they could have been killed by Penelope’s thoughtless action. Let alone the weapons were probably useless and what was left was a huge mess. The succubus tried to suggest that perhaps all they’d have to do is have luggage spew all the weapons on Szen. The women shook their heads in horror telling Penelope that that’d likely kill the whole village.\n\nPenelope feeling sad that she was less than helpful asked Luggage if it could put the weapons away. Of course she asked not realizing how easy it was for Luggage to do such a task. She figured she’d help pick stuff up too. Instead Luggage gave another sigh as though frustrated that it had to clean up already. In one fell swoop, it unravelled it’s velvety tongue and scooped all the weapons back into the depths of it’s body.\n\nSanji had been able to persuade Cortanna to fight Szen. So the group marched off toward the town of Rehm. As the group approached the forest line, a fire could be seen where the little village was suppose to be. Sanji wasn’t convinced that it was real, but Penelope felt like she should go help.\n\nBefore anyone could stop her, Penelope walked out into the clearing. As she does, she could see some men on the outlying wall keeping guard.\n\n“Hey!” I had her call out, “Your town’s on fire!”\n\nThe men were quite astonished to see Penelope and stuttered over their words before finally getting out, “Oh, yes! Uh, we know!”\n\n“Then why aren’t you trying to put it out?”\n\n“We’re just keeping guard to make sure it doesn’t spread,” one guard informed.\n\n“Yes, and looking for the person who committed this arson. You’re not the one responsible for this are you?” another guard added.\n\nBefore even realizing what I was about to say, but miraculously it worked out brilliantly for Penelope, I had her respond, “Pfft! I can’t cast magic.”\n\nEveryone around the table burst into laughter as my DM looked at me questioningly and gave the guard’s response of, “You don’t need magic... to create... fire... Clearly you are an idiot!” I then joined the chorus of laughter as I realized my own stupidity.\n\nBy this time Sanji had joined Penelope. He asked if the town was Rehm. The guards gave a quick look amongst themselves and responded in unison that it wasn’t. Penelope of course failed her sense motive check and asked where Rehm was. They then pointed her in a direction to which Penelope called back to the others to follow and marched off in the direction of Rehm.\n\nOnce she was back in the forest a safe distance, Sanji grabbed her by the hand and led her back to the girls, explaining to her that the men were lying and that they were indeed at Rehm. Cortanna confirmed it too once we arrived back to her, Melinda, and Kedra. She even discovered that the fire was an illusion.\n\nCortanna led the way around the town until we all could see that the fire indeed wasn’t real. As we approached the back of the village, the fire disappeared and a perfectly normal looking town came into view.\n\nBefore heading toward the town, Sanji told Penelope he wanted to cast a spell on us all that would make each of us bigger. He thought us making a big impression would give us a better advantage over Szen. Once everyone was a whole size category bigger (yes, Penelope was now roughly 15+ feet tall... with a ridiculous scythe by her side), the succubus lead the way once more. Sanji beat her to the speaking part, asking where their leader, Szen, was. \n\nThe guards, on this part of the wall, were understandably perplexed by the sudden appearance of large folk. So they threatened us to stop advancing or they’d shoot. Penelope obediently listened. Sanji, however, more cautiously advanced, putting his weapons down and once more asking where their leader was. To that the guards fired off two arrows into Sanji.\n\nPenelope leaped into action, feeling the guards were being unreasonable when Sanji had come across peaceful. She strode two steps toward the wall and with the intentions of just placing her scythe’s blade threateningly between two of the guards, brought her scythe down on the crudely made wall.\n\nAbout 10 feet worth of wall crumbled under the weight and force of the scythe’s blade as Penelope thundered at them, “Hey! We asked a simple question!” Of course as soon as the wall crumbled under her weapon, she added, “Oh sorry!” to those who fell with the ruble. All the men on the wall and on the ground were cowering in Penelope’s presence. So she reiterated the question, “Where’s Szen!?”\n\n“He and the villagers are in the town hall!” one of the men cried out. He pointed toward the largest building in the village. Penelope immediately set off toward it, leaving her party members behind. In her mind her goal was to knock the building over, like a cup, to expose Szen within and grab him.\n\nWhen she got the to building, that was only to her chest in height, to assessed it quickly before setting about tipping it over. It took two great pushes. On the second attempt, the satisfying snapping sound of the building finally giving in to her strength echoed through the town. Then the building crumbled upon itself. Screams rented the air ever so briefly before it was all silent again.\n\nPenelope looked at the mass of rocks and wood mingled with some blood. A satisfactory sigh escaped her lips as she smiled knowing the evil was killed. As the dust settled, Cortanna, Kedra, and Melinda came wailing up to Penelope.\n\n“Penelope!” They exclaimed in unison.\n\n“Oh hey guys!” Penelope responded back with a triumphant smile, “I killed Szen!”\n\n“And the whole friggin’ town!”\n\n“I told you she’s nothing but evil!” Kedra stated.\n\n“But Szen’s dead,” Penelope responded.\n\n“And all the innocent villagers!” Cortanna shot back angrily.\n\nAs the characters bickered with Penelope, I was maniacally laughing at what I had my character do. Knowing how evil Szen was, I was very much enthused by my success over the ethics of my character’s tactics.\n\nEventually Sanji took the time to explain on simple terms the gravity of Penelope’s actions. She then felt some remorse. While the women looked about the town, Penelope feeling glum, tried doing something more useful; making sure they something they could sleep in on their travels.\n\n“Luggage, do you have a bed roll?”\n\nThe luggage appeared next to Penelope and gave a perplexed expression.\n\n“A tent?”\n\nSame expression. Then to be slightly more ridiculous, I had Penelope ask, “Do you have a house?” I was a bit surprised when the DM described Luggage coughing and spitting. \n\nSuddenly Penelope found in front of her a large tower. Just in time for the women to get back and for Kedra to command Luggage to put it was way so they could leave the town far behind.\n\nTO BE CONTINUED",

        "text": "The group who one day would be know as Serpent Squad (after they stole the name) were recruited Dirty half-dozen Style by the nobels of Thaldan. (Golarion of Pathfinder). They were a Half Orc Cavalier with his stupidly smart horse, drunken monk batman, the action librarian, and detective witchdoctor. Names hidden because I can't remember now.\n\nOne of their first assignments was to track down a group of bandits harrassing a town. The group hunted small squads of them down wiping them out with ease when they happened upon a small half ruined tower out in the middle of a forest clearing. Fearing the bandits were using it as a base of operations (they were not) they advanced to explore the structure. \n\nInside they find decaying bodies of bandits laying around on the floor and lots of cobwebs. Fearing giant spiders correctly they pull torches out and advance in a tight formation upwards. They reach a trapdoor to the top of the tower, and the larger chambers above when they feel it stuck tightly. The cavalier and monk use a prybar and a massive crit to finally wedge the door open...to a rain of thousands of tiny spiders on EVERYONE! \n\nThe quartet scream and run like mad fools as the swarms skitter all over the place from the opened nest sitting over the old trapdoor. More spiders flow out from holes in the roof and then they see the larger creatures. The Larger spiders they can hit. The monk and librarian dealing with them. But the smaller swarms are EVERYWHERE! So the Cavalier and Witch develop a plan. The witch casts a spell lighting everything he gazes upon to catch fire! The Cavalier begins shield surfing down the stairs! \n\nCowabunga, spider squish! \n\nHours later the group is shaking half a mile away from the tower in a local creek washing their armor, packs, weapons, skin just to get the senstaion of thousands of tiny spiders off them. When they DO return to the tower they slowly clean the place out taking special pleasure at BURNING everything that doesn't look useful. Later they converted the tower into a hideaway base during their operation, but I got a feeling they never quite trusted the place.\n\nStay tuned for part 2: Looting FOR THE REVOLUTION!",

        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2h7wgu/the_tale_of_scott_proudfist_an_11_year_olds_first/",
        "text": "Hi guys, this is an old story among my friends, but I wanted to share it with reddit too. It was well-received in /r/Pathfinder_RPG, so I figured you guys would enjoy it as well. I was DMing a very rules-light solo adventure with my girlfriend's little brother, who is 11 years old. \n\n---\n\nHe was playing a level 1 human Fighter named Scott Proudfist, helping out a small marshy woodland community with various adventurer-style freelance tasks. His adventure began when he was employed by a local merchant, who had recently inherited a nearby mine, which had been unused for several generations. It was his job to explore the mine, assess the condition of it, and clear out the creatures which had moved in, a typical adventurer quest. \n\nSo he dived right in, and I hoped to let this dungeon serve as a jumping-off point for the adventure, for things immediately began to seem out of place. In this mine were constructed statues, fountains, and even altars. It turns out that the ancestor of the merchant was a head cultist to a chaotic evil god, and the mine served only as a cover-story for the existence of his cult temple. However, when the cultist died, the mine was passed down to his son, who was ignorant to the entire cult and indifferent to the uses of the mine. And so it was unused and fell into disrepair over several generations, monsters moved in, rooms collapsed, etc., until the merchant who inherited it saw the potential wealth that the \"mine\" could provide. It was my intention that Scott would immediately begin to question his surroundings; why would a mine have altars, statues, and so forth? Where were the mine tracks, mine carts, exposed rock? These are all questions I attempted to present in no uncertain terms, but Scott Proudfist refused to take the bait and ask further questions, a motif which becomes almost a running gag throughout the rest of this story.\n\nScott Proudfist *desecrated* this temple. He looted and pillaged, leaving no stone either unturned or intact. In his raid, he came across two cursed items (again, unknown to Mr. Proudfist): a ring and an amulet. He found each of them, and, lacking a way to identify them (or even the cognizance that he ought to), simply tried each of them on. On their own, the items damaged him, and so this was the extent of knowledge that Scott had. When worn together, however, these artifacts, once the possession of the head cultist, served to channel the power of the chaotic god himself. I had all sorts of abilities planned out, from the ability to teleport, to command words that would let you wear one at a time, to magical affinities for amphibians, but their use fell disappointingly to the side. Scott Proudfist simply looted this \"damaging jewelry,\" and, as I like to imagine, skipped carefreely out the mine, whistling a jolly tune.\n\nWhen he rode back into town, Mr. Proudfist came across an old, mysterious wizard waiting for him in the inn he was staying at. The wizard needed help concocting a potion, and saw that Scott was an adventurer who looked capable of gathering his ingredients for him, of which there was an eye of newt, a crocodile heart, dragon's blood, and a snippet of *Scott's own hair*. This man was the only person with any affinity for magic he had encountered in the whole village, was waiting for him specifically, and was generally just described as the creepiest, darkest, shadiest looking dude I could possibly convey. This is because word had spread of quickly throughout the land of the merchant's inheritance, and this wizard was actually another cultist from a far-away city hoping to restore the derelict dungeon as a temple to the god. He came to the village, kidnapped the merchant, and tracked down Scott, even sensing the ancient relics on his person. I hoped to use this wizard as a plot hook to turn Scott back to questioning the dungeon and getting back on track towards the greater story. But Mr. Proudfist, as he is wont to do, naively gobbled up this adventure hook, beginning by ripping out a chunk of his own hair to give to the creepy guy making a potion.\n\nNow, a crocodile's heart and dragon's blood seemed much too out of reach for Scott (and they rightfully were, as I didn't expect him to accept the quest, but then again, this is Proudfist the Unquestioning we're talking about), so he set off to collect the eye of newt. At this point, his sister is in the room and half-listening to the adventure we're playing. Scott creates a plan to head into the marsh and chop up a newt, to which his sister vehemently protests- \"You can't kill the cute little newts!\" So, when Mr. Proudfist the Undoubting encounters a newt in this swamp, I instead make him bargain for the newt's eye.\n\nNow Scott knows the jewelry he's looted is pretty special, even if all it does is shock him, so when the amphibious newt asks for the ring he carries in his backpack, he finally starts to get a little bit skeptical. \"How does this newt know I have it? Why does he want it? How is this newt talking to me?!\" are all questions he would have asked, and are all questions I was desperately pushing him to ask, but instead, he just asks, \"How can you possibly give me your eye?\" (which, to be fair, is another perfectly valid question).\n\nBy the way, the answers to those questions that Scott never asked are: if you'll recall, the jewelry grants magical affinity towards amphibians. Having it on his person, even if he wasn't wearing it, was in my mind enough to communicate with this newt. The newt wanted it because he recognized the jewelry was of his god, and thus it would empower him. He told Scott, however, only that the gold in the ring was worth a lot to a newt, and he'd use it to make a new life for him, his wife, and his children.\n\nSo in response to Scott's voiced question, the newt pops the eye out of his skull and offers it to Scott- it's worth that much to him. Scott still doesn't really want to give away his magic ring, but he's becoming more convinced. He begrudgingly makes the trade, and the newt scampers away. Scott again skipped carefreely out of the marsh, whistling a jolly tune.\n\nWhen he returned to the wizard to give him the eye of newt and to ask advice for the other two items, the wizard was understandably furious, sensing the absence of the cursed ring. But the wizard was shrewd and didn't show his fury, instead making it clear to Scott what he had done. Taking the eye of newt from Scott, the wizard casually remarked, \"What have you done with that incredible magical ring? I sense it is missing from your person.\" And Proudfist the PlaysPathfinderLikeAVideoGame became upset- he'd just given away some awesome loot, and that just would not do! He ran back to the swamp, calling for Larry the newt, whom he had made the trade with.\n\nLarry's brother Jerry rose from the murky water, and let Scott know that Larry had used the ring to teleport away, and by now was already at the ocean, doing whatever religious thing he actually set off to do. And so now it's starting to sink in for Scott the scope of the actions he's already taken. But it's only sunk in a little bit, because the next thing he does is run back to the village inn, and Proudfist the Trusting turns to the wizard, begging him to teleport him to the ocean, so he can track down this newt.\n\nThe old wizard unfortunately isn't that powerful, and he tells Mr. Proudfist, \"I'm sorry, but I can't teleport you away. If you're *reaally* that intent on getting to the ocean, though, I do have this Ocean Potion I can sell you, for 1 gold piece.\"\n\nScott quickly exchanges the money and takes the Ocean Potion from the wizard's gnarled old hands.\n\nThe wizard continues, \"The Ocean Potion is an interesting thing; to use it, all you have to do is-\"\n\n\"I drink the potion.\"\n\n\"I- wait, what, are you sure?\" I say, breaking character.\n\n\"I drink the potion.\"\n\nSo, if Proudfist the Precipitous had allowed the wizard to finish, he would have described that the Ocean Potion is marvelous in that it has condensed the entire ocean into the non-dimensional space of the vial holding the potion. If he had allowed the wizard to finish, Scott would have learned that all you have to do is dump the contents at your feet, bringing the ocean to you. If he had allowed the wizard to finish, he would have quickly and easily thwarted Larry, stopping one bad guy to enable another. But he didn't let the wizard finish, and so none of that happened.\n\nI describe to Scott, \"You feel an intense rumbling in your stomach- you know the nights when your dad makes chicken curry? Like that, but times a billion. You feel a swelling in your stomach. The wizard immediately freaks out, 'Good Lord! You weren't supposed to drink it! You were just supposed to dump it out! You're bringing an entire ocean into your stomach!'\"\n\nMr. Proudfist the Bloated understandably is now quite concerned, begging the wizard to do something. Now the wizard knows he needs Scott alive to re-obtain the ring, but he's not above taking advantage of an opportunity when one presents itself. So he says to Scott, \"Well, I do have this Motion Ocean Potion, to move the ocean out of your system, but it's decidedly rarer than the Ocean Potion, so it will cost quite a bit more...\"\n\nScott throws 100 gold pieces at the wizard, which satisfies him, and the trade is made. Proudfist the FoolMeOnce now downs the Motion Ocean Potion.\n\n\"Okay, roll a d20,\" I say.\n\n\"Wait, no, I don't do that,\" says my girlfriend's little brother. \"I dump the Motion Ocean Potion on the ground.\"\n\n\"Nope, too late,\" I say. (I'm a firm believer in no take-backsies, much to the frequent dismay of my girlfriend's little brother.) \"Besides, that's actually what you were supposed to do. Now roll a d20.\"\n\n\"Alright, I got a 12.\"\n\nAnd this was the story of how Scott Proudfist the Funk pissed outside a small woodland village for 12 years, creating an ocean of pee and a folk tale that spread throughout the land. The village inhabitants grew to hate Scott so much, most of them moved from the village, and a tourist economy sprang up in its place. I like to think at the end of the 12 years, Scott simply stopped peeing, and the people who had come to see just kind of looked around, defeated, asked each other \"Well, what now?\" and then went home, kind of like the scene in Forrest Gump where Forrest just stops running. The entire storyline I had planned was basically ruined at this point, though I'm saving it for a later adventure. And of course, my girlfriend's 11 year old brother had the most fun he's ever had in any game, and now begs me every time I see him to play more Pathfinder with him, which is all I could have hoped for.",

        "text": "* [&lt;&lt; previous](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2gzq6x/vampiretm_john_randoms_revenge_part_3_extralong/)\n\nPreface: I was going to skip a few games, mostly because they were boring ( and so I don’t recall them terribly well ), but I just found parts of the chat logs for them, so I can piece them together somewhat better. I also found my XP log, or at least most of it, and remembered that the ST had some weird XP costs on things. In-clan disciplines were a flat 5 XP ( not x current level), out of clans were 4 x current, everything else was maybe 2-4 XP lower. It was definitely a high-powered game. I now understand why I remembered the PCs having shared their disciplines around up to 3rd and 4th dots already.\n\nBetween games Jalees once again handled a lot of business. He now had entire dossiers on pretty much every Cam and most of the Anarchs, and had left a few copies around town on what the ST assured me were ‘unhackable’ USB drives as dead drops for some brother Hands ( and none of that Tal’mahe’Ra crap. ). It had been three months or so ( the ST was screwy with the timeline a bit. Sometimes between games was a couple days, sometimes it was months ) since his last check in with his brothers, and he figured they may have been getting nervous. ST made the call that Jalees could not sire childer then immediately diab them for points - it had to be some other vampire. I then asked if some other vamp sired and Jalees ate them within a few minutes - ST communicated a very flat look over text. I told him I understand, and that he should have some more NPCs in the wings.\n\nJalees | simple sheet\n--|--\nhighlights | Attributes 3 or 4, Abilities 1-2, except Persuasion(Lying) 5 and Stealth(Obfuscate) 5, Willpower 8, obligatory \"Sabbat Resources 5\"\nDisciplines | Auspex 2, Celerity 4, Obfuscate 4, Quietus 3, Sorcery 3 ( Hunter’s Wind (primary) ), Sorcery 2 ( Awakening of Steel ), Sorcery 1 ( Lure of Flames )\nRituals  | Touch the Earth, Pebble from the Mountain, Gift of Mithra’s Bull, Approach the Veil, Eyes of the Night Hawk, Bind the Accusing Tongue\n\n\nJalees had used Bind the Accusing Tongue on the Prince, the Sheriff, and a few other select NPCs. They had yet to notice the ritual, as Jalees had yet to do something that required condemnation.\n\nPlot 3: the Anarch State Fair\n\nThe Anarch State, the Prince announced, was directly the handiwork of the Anarch leaders and himself. The Prince had graciously given the Anarchs a rather large section of the Domain as their own, as well as feeding rights and rights to some self-governance, as long as they did not become a problem. In exchange, the Cams got some cannon fodder.\n\nAs Jalees instructed him, the Prince said nothing of Jalees’ involvement.\n\nThe Leader of the Anarchs in attendance - AnarchMale - declared that beginning the following night, the Anarchs would be holding a “Hootenanny” that would last from sunset to sunrise, and feature games of all kinds. Amicable refreshments would be provided as reasonable, but please don’t come starving. Jalees perked up at ‘games’. He decided that the Anarchs could do to learn some Sabbat games. He wondered who could teach them…\n\nElysium was officially over for the night, and Jalees stalked off to catch a ride with AnarchMale, offering to help with any setup they needed, and maybe share a few pointers “from the open-air markets and fairs in Istanbul”. AnarchMale couldn’t turn down such an offer, and eagerly departed to fetch the car. Jalees approached Ventrue and gave him a friendly/respectful nod, before addressing him in High German ( a language no one else shared ), sotto voce:\n\n&gt;Jalees: “Ventrue, I do not trust these Anarchs. I think they will only bring pain and suffering.”  \n&gt;Ventrue: “I do not hide dislike nor contempt of them, but I do not see how they could affect us.”  \n&gt;J: “Even so, I do not think the Prince would agree to this without some … encouragement.”  \n&gt;V: “You suspect blackmail?”  \n&gt;J: “I suspect nothing. I merely know my Prince, and I do not think he would take such a drastic move on his own.”  \n&gt;V: *(Thinking I am giving signals via the ST)* “I understand. Perhaps we should watch these Anarchs more closely.”  \n&gt;J: “That is exactly what I intend to do. Please, though, allow me to work alone? I am not used to such direct handling of problems.”  \n&gt;V: *(Thinking it a compliment)* “Of course, of course. I will allow you to have the first crack at them. Let us say the first three hours, and then we will take over from you for the next three hours.”  \n&gt;J: “That is reasonable, and I appreciate that you allow me to move first.”  \n&gt;V: “Then it is agreed. Good hunting, Jack.”  \n\nJalees made neither comment nor expression of his annoyance at the nickname. He merely smiled, and shook the proffered hand.\n\nEnd of session ( it was a bit short)\nNext session:\n\nI dealt with all of Jalees’ end of the Anarchs off camera, for multiple reasons. First, if it ever got out that Jalees was teaching the Anarchs Sabbat festival games, the players would meta-game Jalees right into final death. Jalees ended up teaching the Anarchs two games, both on the dangerous line of breaching the Masquerade ( that which keeps the Vamps from being discovered). The first was the Rat Race:\n&gt;Find an office building where people are still working. The judge will find a person and explain the game to them, so that they know exactly how much danger they are in. The 'rat' will try to escape the building and the competitors must catch the rat while blindfolded. If the 'rat' escapes, she is free and may even be exempt from the game in the future.  \n\nAnd the second Jacques Cousteau:\n&gt;Kidnap mortals, give them cement shoes, toss them in a pool/lake/ocean. Competitors must jump in and \"save\" them. The Competitors must get the mortal completely out of the water ( cement shoes intact! ) before the mortal drowns. Once the game is complete and the mortals feel that they are safe from drowning ( or drowned already ), they are drained and killed. ( Jalees suggested they might just be brain-wiped via Dominate and leave it at that )\n\nThese will feature later in the story. I thought it was particularly glorious, but I am biased. Jalees thought he wrought a little bit of good on the world.\n\nJalees left, telling AnarchMale and AnarchFemale that he had some unfortunately urgent business come up, and that he just had to take care of it immediately, and  he would try to check back in with them before the night was out. The players roll in about 15 minutes after that, being big and imposing and asking rather stupidly obvious questions in an attempt to trip up any Anarchs that were either more stupid or more obvious. They did not succeed in the least.\n\nSadly, I don’t have chat logs from this session, so I can’t reproduce any of the actual dialogue, but it was supremely terrible spywork.\n\nJalees had gone off to train one of the newer Anarchs in town - an accidental conversion during a party - on the ways to not get dead. By ‘train’ I of course mean ‘drain’. Jalees gained another 5 XP, the Camarilla had one less Anarch to worry about and the Anarchs lost a particularly weak link. Wins all around, right?\n\nJalees had a few things to prepare - he had been elected the Judge of the Anarch Games, as he was still seen as new and impartial to the entire affair. Jalees conferred with the Prince on the games that the Anarchs wished to run, in order to both reveal their borderline Masq-breaking plans and to seek his approval to limit the games as best he can. The Prince decided that Jalees would be absolved of all guilt of Masquerade breaches, as he was merely acting in the role he was appointed to - punishment would fall on the Anarchs. Jalees thanked his Prince, with a smile that may have been slightly too wide, and left to make preparations.\n\n* [next &gt;&gt;](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2h8xzq/vampiretm_john_randoms_revenge_glossary/)",

        "text": "The Muscovite Tsardom had been whittled down to a shadow of their former strength, still considerable but nowhere near as numerous as they had been. Holed up in Moscow, they held out against the siege of the Cossack Hetmanate, led by Colonel Ivan Sirko.\n\nI, Ragnar, Lord of Kiev, Sofronovo, Bar Fortress, and Ilyintsy, loyal subject and champion to my liege Khan Islam Giray of the Crimean Khanate, looked with favor upon the former enemies of my lord and sided with the Cossacks to drive the Muscovite Tsardom from the land to join the Polish Commonwealth in ignominious exile forever. \n\nI snuck into Moscow, fought the guards, and vanished into the maze of streets to seek supplies for my troops. After securing a large cache of butter to last us the rest of the siege, I left my mark on the doomed city by buying a round of ale for every manjack defender there.\n\n“And whom shall I say is the benefactor of this gesture?” asked the innkeeper.\n\nI smiled. “Ragnar.”\n\n“Then the people of Moscow shall know the generosity of Ragnar and drink to your name this night.”\n\nI chuckled to myself before slipping away and out of the city gates, appreciating the irony. Saluted as a friend who stood their round one night, soon to be cursed as the conquering Cossack’s henchman the next. \n\nStill, nothing could have prepared me for an ending beyond belief. \n\nI returned to the camp, Colonel Ivan Sirko dismissive to my return, having gleaned enough info and deeming my infiltration useless to his cause. His outright hostility showed when a few of the Muscovite lords attempted to flee the city with a paltry sortie, and my cavalry helped ride them down.  “I have the field, scavenger! The glory is mine alone this day!” he growled as the last Armed Serf was led away in chains. \n\nI snorted, not pointing out one thousand of us compared to thirty of them was hardly glorious. More like butchery. My men and I returned to our camp and waited for the Cossacks to man up and raise the ladders against Moscow’s walls.\n\nWhen at last the assault began, I allowed twenty of the Cossacks to climb the ladder ahead of me, taking the time to pick off a defender or two from below with my double-barreled Dutch pistol. I then ascended to the top, taking on a single marksman here, aiding a double-teamed Black Reiter there, until we gained the walls. A bullet found its way between the shoulder joints in my black armor, knocking away a third of my health. I raised my steel shield, firing my pistol and picking off the enemy at a distance while the more exuberant of my allies charged and hacked. \n\nOkay, prose aside, this is where it gets nuts.\n\nWe were getting slaughtered. They had so many damn elite troops while we were mostly middling infantry. My elite dismounted cavalry slowly died out or were wounded. But then Deus Ex Glitchima.\n\nUp on the walls, a few marksmen refused to go down the nearby stairs, stuck on the very edge of the wall, blocking with their muskets. Below, about fifteen elite gentry cavalry stared up at them, also blocking with their carbines but well out of melee range and refusing to fire. I have an easy time of it, leisurely taking potshots, picking up ammo, dropping my sword for a little more ammo capacity. By this point, I’m about at a third of my health bar. A dangerous ammo retrieval later and a few enemy follow me up the stairs and fall to the swords of the finally-doing-something marksmen who are whittled down to about one. But that same one is holding the paralyzed attention of about thirty more enemy marksmen and archers, who still don’t fire or charge.\n\nThe ammo retrieval knocked me down to a twentieth of my health. If I didn’t have black armor on, I would have been screwed. I am the only one fighting at this point, still firing away with trusty double barreled Dutch pistol. Thankfully, it’s like shooting fish in a barrel. The enemy doesn’t move for some weird reason and I’m careful to pick off around the outside because I figure they’re bottlenecked by some hurrdurr AI tweak. \n\nAbout a thousand XP later, cheers split the air as the last idle enemy falls before my scavenged bullets.\n\nVictory! Now fight the enemy in the streets. \n\nCrap.\n\nMy health restored to a tenth of the bar, I got my sword back, and my pistol ammo is refilled. Somehow, two nohkors, a pikeman, and I fend off several marksmen and another gentry cavalryman. And my health goes back down to a twentieth or perhaps the inspiration for The Thin Red Line 2. \n\nVictory! Now fight the last defenders in the keep.\n\nDAMMIT!\n\nMy health does not increase by any helpful margin. The two nohkors with me evidently found a barrel of beer and a couple of ladies to make poetry about, because two lame pikemen trotted into the keep with me instead of my trusty guards. Those two and me squared off against five gentry cav or some other elite hoopajoop. I figured I was dead at this point, but I managed to stab one of the gentry. The two pikers got another one before taking a bite of curbstone. \n\nThen I was alone. The three elites all turned to me and started swinging. \n\nBUT WAIT!\n\nThey’re morons. They’re swinging scimitars or sabers against black armor. Slashing is mediocre against black armor.\n\n0 damage\n\nBACKPEDAL, RAGNAR! RAISE SHIELD!\n\n4 damage. They keep slashing me before I can slash back.\n\nGYAAAAAH! BACKPEDALLLLLLLLL!\n\n0 damage\n\nMy wounds oozed, coupling with the sweat that trickled down my back, my brow, my arms. The black armor, dented but holding on by threads, felt as though a thousand pounds draped around me. My upper calves hit something hard, almost buckling under the strain. I had backed into the dining table in the hall of the keep.\n\nWithout thinking, calling upon all the physics-defying power of video games, I leaped up, landing on the table, walked backwards, and dropped to the other side. \n\nWill wonders of AI stupidity never cease? Not one of the three elite gentry tried to skirt the table, sabers poised to strike but unable to reach across. My sword did not reach them, either. I sighed, sheathed my sword with an aching arm, took a long, deliberate breath…\n\n…and pulled out my double barreled Dutch pistol once more.\n\nColonel Ivan Sirko sent no word of thanks, nor did I receive any share of the prisoners taken from the fall of Moscow. I imagine he was still smarting from getting shot unconscious during the first charge toward the ladders. \n",

Also has no parents and a massive inheritance.\n\nBrutus/Ben Williams: A regular accountant possessed by the cosmic embodiment of chaos. Has had his life effectively ruined by Brutus. Is currently trapped in a magic bauble the size of a crystal ball being held by a super villain (he couldn't make this session)\n\nShotgun Surgeon: An accomplished MD with a shotgun full of beanbag rounds. Is very Southern. Hates Nightfall.\n\nSolus: The embodiment of the sun. Is very vague. Rarely talks to anyone.\n\nThe team has been fighting the illegal trafficking of a super soldier serum throughout their city. Through some shrewd detective work and a lot of super soldier fighting and eventually facing a wizard, the group finds that the source of the illegal trafficking is working within the police station.\n\nAs soon as they receive this information they are arrested for vigilantism. Once they are brought into the chiefs office, he asks to be left alone with them. He begins to explain his reason for suddenly changing his stance on super heroes when Nightfall shouts:\n\n\"I HIDE IN THE CLOSET\"\n\nMe: \"There's no closet in his office.\"\n\n\"Then I LIE FACEDOWN ON THE GROUND UNTIL HE MAKES ONE\"\n\nHe proceeded to do so and the chief raises an eyebrow. After a moment the chief begins his story again when Shotgun Surgeon says,\n\n\"I put a lampshade on my head and wait for the closet.\"\n\nSince there is a lamp he proceeds to do so. Since this is is the weirdest these guys have ever acted in game the chief sits spellbound for a second. He turns to Solus, \n\nChief: \"It appears your friends are a little... off.

In the ensuing months the super soldier serum becomes as available as pot and every Anarchist, Confederate or Taliban member can get his hands on it. As the government grows under more and more strain from a physically superior foe that seems to be attacking from every angle, it loses control of much of the United States. The world economy collapses and pandemonium ensues. \n\nThe man who ran the super soldier serum cartel made enough money to retire from his job as Police Chief.",

        "text": "* [&lt;&lt; previous](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2gvsn2/vampiretm_john_randoms_revenge_part_2_long/)\n\nPreface: Between the last game and the beginning of this one, I bombarded the ST with questions of all kinds. I made a few rolls off-camera as to who exactly out of the city thought they could trust me with their deep, dark secrets. Short list: everyone except the PCs. Since a few weeks were passing in-game between sessions, Jalees took the time to have a friendly interrogation with every NPC in town. Armed with a fat stack of notes on everyone, and some off-hand quips that indirectly linked into their deep, dark secret, Jalees was ready to start trading information for favors - and by favors, I mean diableres.\n\nIt is at this point where the specific PCs become more important than the PCs as a group. There were four PCs: Brujah, Malkavian, Tremere and Ventrue. I will refer to them as such.\n\nPlot 2: Who let the Mages in?\n\nI actually got to start this plotline, incidentally. Jalees was wandering around chatting up various NPCs before that night’s Elysium, as he is wont to do, and came upon someone being mugged. Being a smart Assamite, Jalees decided to Obfuscate himself ( I had just enough XP to buy dot #2 ) and watch. The mugger had a gun drawn on this very monk-esque looking guy ( Akashic Brotherhood, iirc? ) and demanding his wallet. Monk turned around real slow and looked at the gun, and it “melted as if dunked in acid”. J: “Well, that’s new.” And then Monk round-house kicked Mugger into next week.\n\nJalees decided to not say anything at Elysium openly. He waited to get the Prince alone, carefully explaining how his domain was “lovely” and there were “many interesting people to talk with”, before laying out what he saw. The Prince motioned the PCs over (one of them was a ‘born-again’ Tremere, somehow escaping death after going rogue), and grilled him lightly for info about any sorcery that could replicate that. Tremere said he would look into it with some of his clan, and invited Jalees along to have a guided tour of the City. The Prince warned them politely to take better care of me than their last charge, being an old friend and still under his word of safety. I did not think the players would do anything, but I appreciated the DM’s unsubtle repetition to play nice.\n\nThe PCs and Jalees toured the city, visiting each of their personal havens in turn, and ended at the Tremere Chantry. Tremere went into the Chantry, got approval to invite his friends in, and then told us to wait in the sitting room while he went to check the library. Jalees asked politely if he had any books on Assamite Sorcery, and was met with a pause and a round of laughter. Tremere replies “No, only proper blood magic is performed here.” Jalees decided Tremere should die first.\n\nA while passes, Jalees chatting amicably with the PCs while Tremere makes his rolls. He finds nothing, comes down and declares that “No known blood magic could do that”. Jalees keeps his mouth shut about *Hands of Destruction*, he knew it wasn’t another vampire anyways. Ventrue decides we should inform the Prince, and sends a text for his ghoul to bring the car around. A moment later the car pulls up, we walk outside and get in, and are speeding off. I roll Awareness, to make sure we’re headed in the right direction.\n\nWe’re not. Jalees looks pointedly at the Ventrue. \n\n&gt;Jalees: “Where are we going?”  \n&gt;Ventrue: “What do you mean? To the Prince, of course.”  \n&gt;J: “Is he not still at Elysium?”  \n&gt;V: “Yes, that is where we are going.”  \n&gt;J: “No. It is not.”  \n&gt;V: Makes an Awareness roll. “Sonuva-!”  \n\nThe short limo makes a sharp left, and the passenger side is placed directly in the path of oncoming traffic, which proceeds to kick the crap out of the vehicle and sends us for a tumble. The ghoul driver ( we confirmed it was actually the ghoul ) was super-mangled-dead, and the rest of us made haste out of there before mortals started asking questions. Ventrue was increasingly pissed as he tried to play it off as ‘good help is hard to find’. Jalees was unimpressed. He was reasonably sure that someone had either mind-affected the ghoul or made him think that he was going the right way. Not the ghoul’s fault, really.\n\nAs Ventrue and Tremere bickered about what happened in a dangerously-close-to-IC/OOC-line fashion, Jalees talked to Malkavian about his clan. Malkavian had some derangement where “everything had to be explainable, testable, science-able!” in some fashion or another. M’s player played it as simply being hyper-analytical, not really as a derangement, and did not do Clan Malkavian justice. At all. Jalees decided Malkavian should be the second to die.\n\nEventually the PCs and Jalees got back to see the Prince, and explained to him all of what happened. The Prince decided that Jalees should talk with the Sheriff about how best to contain the threat.\n\nThis was the end of the session.\nNext session.\n\nJalees had resolved the talking with the Sheriff and his deputies - there were now three, the second-newest had disappeared sometime in the last week or so - during downtime, so the players and I were able to hop right to combat. Mostly…\n\nThe Prince passed around news of the deputy’s disappearance, the Ventrue looked at me a moment, and attempted to read my Aura (Aus: 2), and I allowed him to succeed. Jalees had black diablere marks on his aura! Ventrue calls him out immediately, saying he was “Sweeping the room for suspects” and noticed. Jalees remarked, “Of course I do. The entirety of my clan has those marks - penance for our horrible past.” The Prince confirmed that all Camarilla Assamites had the marks. V’s player demands persuasion rolls against the assembled vamps. I say fine. I start at three successes - one from the Prince backing me, two from Sanctity. Difficulty of four for Jalees (Enchanting Voice) and seven for Ventrue. I total ten successes, and Ventrue has a double botch. Ventrue fails to pass it off as a simple mistake, and the entirety of the Domain is 300% on my side.\n\nIn reality, Ventrue was right. I had diablerised that deputy. He was a tasty snack, and Jalees got 8 XP out of it. Jalees had already set up a meeting with some of the higher gen vamps - 9 or 10 ( 11 was minimum in this game, what Jalees was ) - that were not at Elysium often, including a bunch of Anarchs that were attempting to get their movement going in the Domain. That is a story for another time, though.\n\nVentrue, thoroughly embarrassed, shut his mouth and let the Prince finish. The Prince wanted Jalees to help the Sheriff track down this new threat, and he was officially ordering the PCs to help me in that duty. He created a temporary office of ‘Sergeant at arms’, appointed Jalees, and appointed the PCs as his deputies. Jalees immediately retorted that while he would value the help, he did not want to force the PCs into anything without their trust and agreement. The players decided “Well, the plot is going this way anyways…” and signed on.\n\nWe found the mage in short order, and had him cornered in an alleyway not long after that. I had already bat-phoned the Sheriff and the Scourge ( I was one of four people who knew who she was ), and was waiting for them when the PCs decided to just off the mage themselves.\n\nNot wise.\n\nIn short, they were completely shut down by the mage, though they did manage to land some hits. After that I waited a beat, and walked past the alley, like some random mortal, looked in, and saw this battered and bruised guy surrounded by Torpored vamps ( to a mortal, K.O. mortals ), ran over and asked how he was doing, offered to get him to a hospital, etc. etc. Mage says no, it’s all fine, he can still walk - proceeds to take a step and stumble. I catch him, get under his arm, and help him limp away. \n\nFor about two steps, then I hit him with Dagon’s Call (Qui:3), and choked him with his own blood. He was too weak to resist anything else at that point, so I took him back to the other four, fed them each one point of his blood ( he had just enough left ), and offered the dead body to the Sheriff when he arrived.\n\nThe Players were upset that I didn’t help at the beginning, but saw the beauty of my ‘plan’ after the mage completely kicked their collective ass single-handedly.\n\nThe Prince rewarded Jalees with a haven of my own, some ‘spending cash’ ( about $1m ), and a ghoul of his own. The Sheriff, wisely, asked Jalees privately to be an ‘undercover’ deputy. Jalees accepted everything with poise and grace. The rest of the players were also rewarded in some way or another, but they were mundane.\n\nThe following night, Jalees threw a haven-warming party ( his haven had *mysteriously* been declared a secondary Elysium by the Harpy ), invited the entire Domain, Cam and Anarch alike, and threw a grand gala. The party drew to a close, and he had the Prince and a few Anarchs stay for some business talks. They discussed how having a small Anarch State in town could be beneficial to both parties, drew up temporary treaties everyone signed ( until real lawyers could be called in for the fine print ), and sent them on their way.\n\nThe two completely smashed 9th gen Anarchs that had been invited to sleep it off in the basement never left, even though Jalees had security footage that proved otherwise. Jalees dropped to 10th gen and gained 20 xp. It was a good night.\n\n* [next &gt;&gt;] (http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2h52uq/vampiretm_john_randoms_revenge_part_4_long/)",

        "text": "https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bwsr0_kEk2Vba2hDRDJFSlJzNDg/edit?usp=sharing\n\n\nThe gang’s actually all together for this week’s session, and we jump right into scouting for our next mission.  Mister Johnson wants us to snatch the _dude_ that made the cylinder we brought him last session, we assume because they can’t figure it out.  But that’s fine, we don’t care if they need him to make it work, or to turn it mauve.  We’re just here for the moneys.  \n\nThe briefing package included the home address of the target, and we were delighted to find that it was a business hotel owned by a Renraku _subsidiary_, not directly owned and operated by the megacorp.  Very reassuring.  The building had excellent security responses, and a nice tight grid though.  We nibbled carefully at the matrix defenses and made some headway while we debated on strategies. \n\nHotentote was the one to suggest it, I believe.  We hired some runners to smash-and-grab the ‘security core hardware’ from the building next door.  Hotentote made some calls and had three elementals on hand to back the distraction team up.  We loaded up with smoke grenades and flashbangs and put together the rest of the plan. \n\nThe hotel had a fire escape.  As near as we could tell from the street, there was a maglock and a door handle on the outside.  Perfect.  The target lived in the room nearest the fire escape. \n\nI hate it when our GM spoonfeeds us a lucky break like that.  It always makes me think he’s got something up his sleeve.  And I’m usually right.  This time, it’s that the target actually isn’t alone.  Hotentote got a watcher spirit into the apartment and it looks like a girl and a child.  An interesting problem.\n\nToday though, appears to be going smoothly.  The distraction team is just a tiny bit slow, but they show up and away we go.  Elliot manages to brick the cameras on our path, and up the fire escape as the High Threat Response Team chased the distraction team. \n\nIn the fire escape door, alarms go off and toss a couple smoke grenades down the hall.  Knock politely on the target’s door.  Lady opens the door. \n\nPolitely explain that we’re the security detail here for her and her boyfriend, and they should come with us.  The target comes in from the bedroom, his hands busy putting a belt on, and it’s TAKE TAKE TAKE.\n\nThe gal goes down in a blast of magic and I get hands on the target.  He gets a stun glove to the back of the neck and becomes furniture. The target goes in the armor bag, and Hotentote convinces the kid that we actually are the security detail and it’ll be OK and never mind he just stunned the kid with magic.  He gets the gal over his shoulders, I strap on the bag and hold the kid and we’re-\n\nFacing a crew of tired old men.  http://i.imgur.com/Pef1NnA.jpg  \n\nIn game, my threat sensors are going off - they have the confident stances of runners with heavy corporate backing.  Out of game, I recognize those bastards, and I can’t stop laughing. \n\nCrumbles is, IRL, so wired up on caffeine that when he makes a bribe attempt he offers 50,000 nuyen.  A third of our take.  Quite a bit more money than we have on hand. \n\nCrumbles goes down in a shower of sparks.  Shaking my hand loose, I apologize for the idiocy of our fellow, and proffer the ~48,000 nuyen that is everything we actually have on our persons.\n\nThey take it.  Hotentote hands me the gal, I manage to handle all three targets.  He grabs Crumples and we exit stage left. \n\nAnd somehow manage to walk past the Knights Errant HTR team and conventional Knights Errant officers doing crime scene control and assisting the fire protection teams dealing with the ‘fire’ in the apartment building.  We get in the car and just…  drive away.\n\nOut of character, Our GM wouldn’t stop growling at this point.  I think he actually threw away some D6, ‘cause we were bulletproof - and evaded the second part of the shoe he had planned to drop.  \n\nCrumples went in the trunk, and the targets got crammed into the backseat so Elliot could watch ‘em, and we were off.  Mr. Johnson tried to knock us on getting the girl, but Hotentote convinced him that they were a handy lever on the target.\n\nAnd off we went, another successful mission, even if we had some stumbles.\n\nNext Time: Crumbles gets disciplined.",

        "text": "* [&lt;&lt; previous](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2gswud/vampiretmthe_short_story_of_john_random_and_the/)  \n\nThis continues the aftermath of John Random, and introduces my next character, Jalees Kamal* the Assamite. (*fig. a perfect friend). Jalees, taking the name Jack since no one else even attempted to pronounce his name properly, was an extremely interesting Assamite. Names have been changed or omitted where possible to hide the guilty.\n\nI started him off rather low powered, one dot in each discipline, the bare minimum in everything else but maxed out his Persuasion, and gave him the merits Enchanting Voice, Sanctity, Blush of Health and a custom one that allowed him to get more out of diablerie than normal. Combined with a 7 point Dark Secret, I was exactly balanced on points ( I got some XP-as-freebies from John Random ). Through further finagling I convinced the GM to let me have all 5 of the Assamite possible in-clan Disciplines: Auspex, Celerity, Obfuscate, Quietus and Assamite Sorcery. How?\n\nJalees was a Sabbat Assamite, on the Path of Blood, and a member of the Black Hand. He had been sent into the city explicitly to cause as much chaos as possible, for as long as possible, and then be a sacrifice when the rest of the troops came a-calling. He was fully supposed to die within 5-6 games. The ST had approved the character based solely on that fact, though I (wisely) made him promise that I could continue the character until he was outed and dead. He survived more than 30 games. I’ll package the stories by plotline as best as I can. I can include Jalees’ stat blocks if people would like to see them.\n\nPlot 1: New guy in town. *Note, ‘the players’ or ‘the PCs’ does not include me or mine unless I specify.\n\nAt the next game session, the players were honestly, and perhaps angrily, surprised to see me. I explained that the ST had given me one more chance, and that I had a radically different character to play. They grudgingly accepted, and decided to “let me play just once more” to see if I could fit in to the group.\n\nElysium is called, everyone is told about the unfortunate accident that occurred with John Random. The Prince said that he had someone else to introduce, his “good friend from back home and under his personal protection” the Camarilla Assamite Jalees Kamal. Jalees comes out, introduces himself with his Enchanting Voice and Sanctity, and all of the NPCs just lap up my little speech about being “interested to see the New World after being stuck in Istanbul for so long”, “honored to meet everyone”, and “set aside time to talk with anyone who would like to”. One of the players instantly took note of this, and decided I was lying. He rolled to out me in my lies, and would have succeeded amazingly - except that I wasn’t lying.\n\nThat settled them slightly. The Prince handed me off to some NPCs, who almost began babbling before the Harpy shushed them. The Prince then said that the Sheriff had informed him of some unexpected werewolf guests in the city, the Sheriff was out hunting and wanted people to help. The PCs, being murderhobos, immediately said yes, and I decided that I would come along as well, despite being quite terrible in a fight. A few of the NPCs came along to protect me, as they had picked up that the PCs had not handled John Random in the most honest of circumstances.\n\nWe met up with the Sheriff, who had already tracked the furballs back to their resting place, and was just waiting for backup to go in and slaughter them. He split everyone into teams and we entered the place from different sides. The PCs were one group, going in the front entranced because they were big, dumb, loud murderhobos. My NPC buddies and I were another, and the Sheriff and Deputy were the third. The PCs decided to argue for a bit about how exactly to enter the building with the most surprise ( “quietly” came up not once ), and when they finally did, they found the rest of us standing around waiting for them.\n\nI had used Silence of Blood (Qui:1) to silence my group as we walked into the place from the back, walked to each sleeping furball, and stab the heart with a silver blade while the NPCs took the throat and head, and a third held the briefly thrashing body down ( he had Potence 5 ). All four of the targets were dead even before the Sheriff and Deputy made it down from clearing the top floor.\n\nThe players grudgingly admitted that maybe I could build a decent character and handle things strategically.\n\nThe characters went back to the Prince, and I was allowed to tell the story. I conveniently left out that the PCs had been bickering for so long they didn’t even get into the building at all. The Prince was happy, the Sheriff was happy, and the PCs were happy. I then, privately, informed them that they now owed me a personal boon, collectively. I made sure to register the boon with the Harpy:\n\n&gt;Harpy: \"What for?\"  \n&gt;Jalees: *(big smile)* \"Services rendered.\"\n\nThe players then admitted that maybe I would be a good addition to the group, and there was much joy in their voices.\n\nMy plan was coming along perfectly.\n\n* [next &gt;&gt;](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2gzq6x/vampiretm_john_randoms_revenge_part_3_extralong/)",

        "text": "Preface: I was hunting around for a game to play in after I was somewhat perma-DM’d in my group. I hunted far and wide for an agreeable group, and thought I had found a decent sort. I was terribly, terribly wrong. So I made the best of it, and ended up killing everyone.\n\n--\nThis begins the story of John Random the Caitiff ( no relation to Jack Random ), wherein he enters a new city held by the Camarilla ( he was not an Anarch ), and was killed within an hour.\n\nJohn Random was a Caitiff of the mortals. Obfuscate, Presence, Dominate, lots of Contacts, Resources, Haven, Empathy, Persuasion. Someone who could whip a mob to frenzy or calm them down into horrified shame. He knew someone on every street from one end of the city to the other, and had half of them on retainer.\n\nJohn walked into Elysium, followed all of the Cam Rules, presented himself to the Prince, asked for permission to putter about the City for a few months, gave the Prince a gift in a box ( it was a very expensive brand of wine for the Ventrue who needed to have alcohol-laced blood to feed from ). Prince says yes, tells the PCs to keep an eye on me for a couple weeks to make sure nothing dumb happens.\n\nBusiness handled, Harpy kicks everyone out, tells them to come back the next day. I can only imagine that the other players were not super interested in having a fifth wheel along, so they set out to kill John as quickly as possible, without actually just murderhobo-ing him. They maneuvered around John in such a way that to complete his current objective, he had to break rules that he didn’t know about. So, being the honorable Camarilla-fu that they were, they one-round-killed him.\n\nAt this juncture I pinged the ST out of game and asked him what just happened, while the other characters dragged the dead body back to the Prince to tell him of my terrible, terrible crimes. The ST said that it was pretty much out of his hands, and told me to just roll a new character that was more like “traditional Camarilla”. Fine, I said, I’d have one done in twenty minutes, make some room for me in a scene.\n\nAs I listened to the players mock my character - I was now firm in my thinking that the players had taken a deep dislike to the character, and perhaps by extension, me - I discovered what the ST had meant by “traditional Camarilla”: a politicking, heartless, immoral, unethical, flat character who was in it for the XP and the chance to order underlings about.\n\nThat was when I decided to kill all of their characters.\n\nAnd so concludes John Random. [Next time](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2gvsn2/vampiretm_john_randoms_revenge_part_2_long/), join me for my next character in this game, Jalees Kamal the Assamite.\n",

They hear people approaching so the Druid turns into a rat, the ranger hides in the shadows and the fighter sits at the head of the table as if he belongs. \n\nWhen the people enter and spot the fighter they star to ask him who he is and why he is sat there, he immediately starts making demands about a feast sending the members of the necromancers cult scurrying into the kitchen.

The door to the roof (and the magical death laser) was locked, and he would GIVE us the key...if I traded him my shiny new warforged arm for his older one. It was an ok trade, I would loose one of my grapplers but gain fire damage.\n\nI took it.\n\nA few days later, I wake up to my PJs on that arm being singed off. A day after that, I wake up to my arm around my own throat. This arm was Chaotic Crazy, and I was rocking a solid True Neutral. Over the course of the campaign, Inquisitive Lam tended toward leaping before looking, crusading for goblin rights (another story for another time), and eventually helping a friend ascend to godhood.

        "text": "Hello everyone,\n\nSo here’s a story from my groups last session, if people are interested in hearing about other sessions let me know. Context is it’s a homebrew Kingmaker, and after a long leg of shenanigans and writing mostly untrue tales of our valour we finally managed to create a new state for ourselves. There’s plenty of stories about our pre-adventures and the hilarity of trying to run a state, but for now I’m just gonna cover the latest thing we ran into it.\n\nFor those interested the party is level 4 with the Lord Protector Marcus, a lance toting cavalier of righteousness. Councilor Kader (me), a sorcerer who nobody in the party trusts (They got a bit suspicious when they noticed I could convince anyone of anything with my ungodly high bluff). General Krios the Monk, who does not like Kader since he’s useless in a fight. The spymaster Seneca, a Ninja who I’m convinced is either going to try and murder us or trip down a well and drown. Finally our treasurer Canuis, an alchemist who went to heavy drinking after it turned out taxing people is actually hard work. \n\nAnyway just outside of our territory is a number of independent farming families, living their life on the great frontier without anyone telling them what to do. One of these farmers pays a visit to our Ruler, Marcus, who accepts the visit because he’s suspicious I’m screening all the people who meet him (I’m only kind of). This old women tells him that a pack of wolves have been going around and murdering whole families, and seeing a good chance to get out adventuring he accepts. So cue the party leaving behind their real work to go hunt wolves (It’d been a year of people complaining about no roads so we were ready to take any excuse to leave for a bit).\n\nFast forward to meeting with a family of farmers who have oddly not been horribly murdered like every other family around them and we learn that these wolves are actually spiritual in nature. They got mad cause the farmers went out to kill them for killing their sheep or something. We’ve already murdered two big spirit animals so were not exactly druids, so this doesn’t change our game plan.\n\nIt takes a bit of searching but eventually we track down the magical pack hounding a family, who have locked themselves inside their house. We get them to stay inside as we look around but the wolves have vanished. I tell the family to stay indoors while we go searching for the pack- but the instant we get any distance we hear wolf cries back from the farm. We return and the packs gone again.\n\nIt’s at this point I realize the pack’s working on curse logic. No one in the party has done anything to draw their rage, so they have no reason to stick around when we come back. So then begins Kaders list of idea’s to piss off spirits:\n\nFirst plan, make a wolf effigy out of straw and get Marcus to shoot it with a burning arrow with the farmers bow. I think this annoys the pack but they don't come out to get us. Instead a number of the wolves circle the place, howling all the time, but I know tricks when I see them so no one goes out to get them.\n\nKrios takes out a bedroll and tries to get some sleep, probably hoping the wolves attack him so he can punch them to death. No dice however as the wolves just continue to make noise all night.\n\nAfter bumbling about on this farm for a while my plans start getting desperate. I ask Krios if he’d like to smear blood on his face (Suggesting we use a bit of the farmers). He does not. Then I’m pretty certain the farmer has a daughter and I ask if anyone wants to marry her? (Pointing out that as ruler, Marcus can legally wed people). The idea being the party member would then be family and thus take on the curse. But no one in the party wants to get married over what might be a stupid plan.\n\nWhile I’m grasping at straws I didn’t know that the Dm’s plan was to basically have the wolves howl all night so no one can get a proper rest, and attack us while we were fatigued. He was basically going to have them start hunting us and waiting for us to be at our actual weakest. But I didn’t get this far by letting Dm’s have their way.\n\nIt is at this point I make a horrifying realization. I have disguise self.\n\nVery very reluctantly I explain I could disguise myself as the cursed farmer, and with everyone else hiding in the barn the wolves might attack me. Krios immediately says “I love this plan” \n\nEveryone takes their places, I go inside the farmhouse, take some of the farmers clothes, and exit looking like the farmer. I then run out screaming into the night air “I’m here you bastards! Take me, but leave my family be!”\n\nRoll bluff, 33.\n\nI’m a very convincing farmer. In fact, so convincing every single wolf attacks me.\n\nKrios: “This has made the whole trip worth it”\n\nI originally planned to do my little speech and then dash up a ladder onto the roof where I’d be safe. I did not count on failing my will save and becoming dazed by the sight of a horse sized wolf. Everyone bursts out of the barn to save me, a second after a couple of wolves are tearing me to shreds. Our alchemist graciously saves my life by throwing a bottle of healing at my face, getting glass everywhere. This is of course when the big wolf, seeing me not really being the farmer, decides to eat my shoulder and I go down again. \n\nBig fight ensues, I almost die a few times but the party gets the wolves off my unconscious body. The fight quickly turns as Marcus charges with his lance and slays the big wolf, and the rest are cleared up.\n\nAs I’m healed up Krios looks over the group and says “Well, that went about as well as expected”",

        "text": "After completing a mission, the party had a bit of cleanup to do. Specifically, we had to go pick up a disembodied ear that had a sensory link with our Wizard. When we reached the cave I stood watch outside while the rest of the party went in to study the cave and collect the ear.\n\nAfter a short game of marco-polo they found the ear, but before they could pick it up a nearby mouse grabbed it and ran off. The pain caused by his sensory link put the wizard out of commission, and he wasn't able to help. Our Bard was distracted by something and not helping. Our second Wizard decided to try talking to the mouse, which proved useless as the mouse was too terrified and stupid to hold a conversation.\n\nThis left our fighter as the only member of the party who could do anything about this mouse. We assumed that he would simply corner the creature and pick up the ear. Instead, he pulled out his recently acquired magic sword - which allows him to teleport towards his enemy and strike them - and attempted to use it on the mouse. \n\nThere were already a number of problems with this course of action, but we were introduced to one we hadn't realized - he has no idea how to aim the sword. Instead of teleporting to the mouse he ended up directly in front of our very surprised Bard, and immediately knocked him to zero hit points. We now had an unconcious party member in an encounter with a mouse, which is fairly shameful.\n\nInstead of doing the reasonable thing and sheathing the sword, our Fighter decides that he just need to try again. He roared with all his fury and, due to considerable luck, ended up in front of the mouse. Unfortunately, he completely missed. Luckily, we were able to cast magic missile to kill the mouse before our fighter could prepare a third teleport and potentially down a third party member.\n\nAt this point I walked in, curious what was taking so long. I got to see a wonderful scene of our Wizard yelling in exultation, our Bard unconsious, and the rest of the party glaring at our Fighter. ",

        "text": "[Part 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2ga3es/dd_35_did_i_mention_that_i_dont_like_dming_evil/)\n[Part 2](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2gbmbf/dd_35_did_i_mention_that_i_dont_like_dming_evil/)\n\nWhen we last left Player, he had just inadvertently done a great deal of good for a small village, before stealing and riding off on a horse from their stables.\n\nAfter a few hours of travel, during which time he went unmolested by random encounters, Player reached a path that would lead him over a mountain ridge and into \"elf country.\" The path seemed to have been hammered into the stone, forming a long, steep path that doubled back over itself a few dozen times before reaching the top (actually the lowest passable point between two separate peaks). The path looked something like [this](http://www.explorecrete.com/various/images/crete-roads.jpg) if you want a visual aid, just picture it steeper, with a thinner path.\n\nAs Player rides his stolen horse through the path, wishing that he had a flying mount, small pebbles start falling down the mountain. The pebbles were quickly followed by rocks, then small boulders. Amazingly, he passed all of his DEX/Ride checks and took cover at the bends in the path until he could rush the horse through the straightaways in relative safety.\n\nFinally, he reached the top (the whole process taking several hours in game, not counting boulder-dodging), where he took a moment to marvel at the verdant landscape beyond the mountain, and thought about where an evil fortress would look best.\n\nAfter a few seconds, he is overshadowed, and quickly looks up to see what was above him. At first, he sees nothing but the gray stone of the mountain, until the color shifts, and he catches a distinctive silver gleam in a very distinctive shape.\n\nHe passes a knowledge check to recognize the shape as a silver dragon, and (contrary to what I expected from him) keeps his weapons sheathed, instead raising his hand and acknowledging the dragon. Not expecting this (the dragon as well as myself), the beast climbs down the rock and faces him. I had expected him to attack right away, or do something evil to give it cause to attack him.\n\nInstead, he sticks around and chats with the dragon, asking about the weather up at the summit (cold and windy), what the dragon ate (whatever it felt like snatching up), and whether or not it was currently employed (no, and also not interested in working for him).\n\nThe dragon (henceforth dubbed \"Silver\" because I can't remember her loooong name) asks what brings him to her mountains, to which he casually responds:\n\nPlayer: \"I have been forced to come this way by the paladins of St. Cuthbert, who operate in my city. I killed an elf merchant, they found out, captured me, and put me under a spell. Now, I am to deliver his remains to his family and await their judgement.\"\n\nSilver: \"Why did you kill the elf?\"\n\nPlayer: \"Why not? I wanted his stuff, I didn't want him seeing me, so I killed him in his bed. He didn't even put up a fight.\"\n\nSilver: \"Why didn't the paladins just execute you?\"\n\nPlayer: \"I guess it's because I used to be one of them. I turned away from the order a long time ago, and I now seek power through... other means.\"\n\nSilver (sighing heavily): \"Ordinarily, I would destroy you just for that. But, I hate to deny the paladins their justice, not to mention the family of your victim...\"\n\nPlayer: \"Oh, thank you.\"\n\nSilver: \"Say, I noticed that it took you a long time to get up here. Would you like to know a faster way down?\"\n\nPlayer: \"Hell yes!\" (I wasn't actually sure if that counted as breaking character, considering his Blackguard class.)\n\nSilver: \"Well then, accept my gift, and good luck with your quest. I hope you change your ways.\"\n\nWith that, the dragon places a claw on his head and casts a spell on him, repeats the process with his horse, then proceeds to pick them up and chuck them over the side of the mountain.\n\nPlayer looks at me incredulously. Probably wondering why I would have the dragon turn on him with no indication whatsoever (I didn't ask him to roll Sense Motive or anything).\n\nSimple answer? I like to have fun. Smiling wickedly, I continued.\n\nAs the mountain rushed up past him, he and his horse screamed and flailed as they fell, only noticing after about a minute that their descent seemed much slower than it should.\n\nThey did reach the ground much more quickly than they would have if they had walked, and Silver's feather fall spell saw to it that they arrived uninjured (except for the horse, who would go on to develop PTSD (although I'm not sure if there is a mechanic for psychological issues in mounts).\n\nAfter calming down his mount, Player rode off towards his destination, trying to play it cool.\n\nAfter another hour of riding, Player reached the edge of the forest, checked his map again, and continued riding for the trees.\n\nOnly to be knocked out of his saddle by an elf-shaped missile.\n\nWhen they came to a stop, he looked up to see an elf wearing strange clothing, like nothing he had ever seen. I described it to him as Aztec warrior dress with a lot more greens and browns.\n\nShe was also holding a spear, with its head consisting of bright white light, against his throat.\n\nAs an aside, I made this character after watching Oberyn's demise on Game of Thrones and a bit of poking through the list of fighter bonus feats. A few levels of fighter, a bunch of monk, and eventually druid, and we've got a reaching, ki-channeling, rapid-striking, animal summoning nature warrior. I wanted to name her something vaguely Aztec-sounding (with the help of a name generator) and came up with Atonalxotl.\n\nRolling diplomacy, Player very politely asked her what the problem was, and whether or not they could speak without him on his back.\n\nAtonalxotl replies that he would not be allowed to taint her people's forest, and that she had been sent to either turn him away or kill him before he could do any damage.\n\nPlayer: \"Perhaps we can make a deal?\"\n\n~To Be Continued.~\n\n[Part 4](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2j3m74/dd_35_did_i_mention_that_i_dont_like_dming_evil/) is up!",

        "text": "Cross-posted from /r/DnD cleaned up, and embellished. I just discovered this wonderful subreddit. \n\nThis is the only story I remember from any D&amp;D game since my group rarely gets to play anymore—too much real life and careers and parenthoods and so on.\n\n**The Cobblestone of Destiny**\n\nMy group was made up of five individuals and a sixth occasional. It was myself, my wife, our two friends who were also a couple, my brother, and \"friend\" who hung out occasionally but he was one of those super annoying stat maximizers. The rest of us just rolled fun characters we'd want to play without much thought about stats. We'd evolve them organically because that was more fun.  He was boring as fuck and would always roll a character that made him output tons of damage and would take hours to resolve each turn. Fuck that guy. \n\nAnyway, this was our first time playing together because none of us had really played since college. The friend who was part of the couple DMs this game. He's a bit serious business about DMing and will frequently call us on bullshit but he was flexible when we were being creative. So we roll our first 3.5 characters. The last game most of us had played was AD&amp;D and my wife (then girlfriend) had never played any d20 games so this was all new territory for her. The party was pretty standard: a wizard, a thief, a bard, and a barbarian. The maximizer rolled out some kind of shield bashing time traveling, killbot or whatever. No one cared.\n\nI rolled a cognitively impaired barbarian, Tork—hurr hurr, get it? Torque—with a serious alcohol problem. He could barely form sentences and needed a helper—played by my brother's morally ambiguous, elven, three-card monty hustler, and part-time thief who used [my idiot barbarian as protection muscle](http://i.ytimg.com/vi/iPhw1Ldp0fg/hqdefault.jpg). Any significant social interaction was handled on Tork's behalf by the elf since Tork was more likely to stutter, get frustrated, lose his temper, and headbutt the offending party.\n\nAt some point in the very first adventure we were attending some harvest festival when raiders—at least it wasn't rats or goblins—struck. Tork, true to form, wandered away from his handler, got into the alcohol, and was thoroughly piss-drunk. He had also managed to misplace his weapons and most of his clothes. The rest of the party had their weapons peace-bonded since open carry is allowed but the local municipality can dictate how you can open carry via bi-laws and overbearing regulations. \n\nSo, the raiders are galloping by, hitting civilians with sticks and sharp objects, ruining the festival, and making a racket. As a raider approached Tork, I declared a perception check for improvised weapons. The DM, thinking he's a smartass, states that there are none handy aside from a cracked cobblestone. \n\nTork drunkenly hamfists the cobblestone, loses any and all emotional self-regulation, and natural-20s the closest raider with the cobblestone, bursting his head like a ripe melon. Due to his intense inebriation Tork was unable to stand and perform any other action at the same time. I had to constantly roll for both maintaining my footing and not throwing up violently due to the exertion. Tork spent most of his time face down in the dirt or throwing up his guts as I managed to fail both of those checks fairly often during the fight. \n\nNonetheless, Tork was still able to brutally murder every raider who was unfortunate enough to end up within Tork's arm reach. Despite being too drunk to consistently stand without throwing up or collapsing, I kept rolling ridiculously well—no more natural 20s after the first, but good rolls nonetheless—just when I needed the rolls:\n\n* Roll for maintaining balance. Fail. **Tork collapses face first into the dirt.**\n* A raider steps within arms reach. I roll for grapple. Succeed! **Tork pulls the raider down into the dirt by his dick.**  \n* You are on top of the raider. Attack roll with cobble stone. Succeed! **Tork smashes the raider in the face, blood spraying everwhere** \n* You are feeling nauseous, roll to avoid vomitting. Fail. **Tork vomits all over the limp body of the raider he just killed**\n* Roll to stand up. Fail. **Tork stumbles and is now lying on his back**\n* A raider runs up to stab Tork... etc.\n\nThis repeated every turn. Tork managed to murder quite a few raiders and at the end of the fight was lying in the middle of a pillow fort made of dead bodies.\n\nThe next day, after recovering, Tork was convinced that the stone was magic. He dispenses with all of his weapons and most of his clothes—he believed that being naked was part of the stone's power but the rest of the party objected to him running around with his junk loose—and tied a leather strap to the stone. He rolled that way for the rest of the campaign being thoroughly disinterested in all treasure, armor, and weapons.\n\nThat cobblestone has made itself into several other D&amp;D campaigns as well as outside including a Star Wars campaign, and a Shadowrun campaign. It has become our group's locnar.",

        "text": "I grew up in the City under the guide of the grand Priest of Farolan. Weaponry and Wizardry were not the way of the priesthood thus I was taught to use a bow for Hunting and Competition. It was speculated that I was to be one of the finest competitive archers in all the land however before my 15th Birthday my adoptive father was murdered and I escaped the city in order to survive. For months I slept beneath the stars and hunted small rabbits to satiate my hunger and eventually while attempting to steal chickens from a small farm away from any major towns or cities I was caught by an elderly Farmer, who after a night of discussion decided to clothe, feed and house me if I worked on his farm with him. \n\nHe had no wife or children and was going blind, however we would often tell stories of his time amongst the kings guard in the City of Farolan and his adventures afterwards. A set of thick leather hung for years above the stone fireplace never to be used again. Eventually, after many long years of friendship and love he died leaving all he owned to me. Again years passed, me content with my quite farming life amongst the outskirts of any civilization – this was a life I gladly would have stayed with until my death were it not for one October day. \n\nWhile out in the fields tending to my crops I noticed a cloud of black smoke billowing from a nearest farm a few miles away, I left my plow behind and ran towards the fire.  The farm was owned by a Husband and Wife along with their young son but upon my approach I saw no sign of life. The house had been set ablaze and large rats attacked me as soon as I showed up. I defended myself with a nearby broom and quickly entered the burning house to look for survivors. In the corners of their bedroom I found the bodies of the Husband and Wife, murdered – their bodies red with blood, but there was no sign of the boy. I called out for him and eventually found him hiding under the bed. We quickly escaped to watch the house crumble behind us. \n\nAs we lay out front of the burning house, the boy lying beside me I knew the life he knew was over.  Moments later a man walked up to us wearing a black robe, I was clearly hesitant to speak with him as rarely do people come around these parts, but he seemed inquisitive about what had happened here. I let him know as much as I did but he seemed particularity interested in the boy. Eventually he left but I was suspicious of the man who said his name was Malik, but once he left I took the boy back to my home. \n\nThe boy said very little but I asked as much as I could; \n“Who started the fire?” I asked the boy,\n“I don’t know, I only heard one of their voices” He answered shyly, tears streaming down his face. \nI knew that he had no seen the faces of the men who killed his family, but perhaps he could remember their voices. \n\n“If you ever heard the voice again, would you recognize it?” I asked\nHe stopped crying and looked up at me with a stern stone like expression. \n“Absolutely.” He whispered. \n\nI knew not what the future held, but I knew that whoever murdered this child’s parents were either not aware he was alive or would not be keen to find out that he could identify them, so I told him;\n\n“Should a time come that you EVER hear this man’s voice again, I want you to whistle.”\n\nHe nodded in agreement.\n\nWe spent the next few days eating and discussing silently what would happen with him. He had an uncle in Farolan and after a short discussion I felt it best to take him back to this Family. We packed up and the next night we were ready to leave my home. I donned the armor my old friend left hanging above his fireplace and we left the farmlands behind. \n\nAt the end of the first day we travelled on the road towards the City I decided to make camp, however there was an odd chill in the air and the road was rather open. Unfortunately no perfect place to camp was found so I decided to err on the side of caution and place a decoy camp. \n\nI set up a tent and fire pit close enough to the road to be seen by passersby but we slept on the Forrest floor a good 100+ feet away from the camp itself giving us an advantage to anyone approaching. The boy fell asleep fast and I decided to stay vigilant, bow and arrow in hand should someone approach however I did eventually fall asleep.   \n\nI awoke to the sound of snapping twigs under the weight of a heavy man, then I heard multiple footsteps off towards the area of the camp. It was pitch black in the woods save for the streaks of moonlight cutting through the canopy above. I surveyed the situation and from what I could see there was no threat, they would find the camp empty and leave it perhaps assuming that we had already been killed. I tensed my muscles, stretching them so they were not stiff from the short rest I had taken. \n\nSlowly they approached the camp and with a whooshing sound the tent was smashed with a Warhammer. \n\n“Where are they?!”\n\nI heard a familiar voice say – it was Malik from days before. He had been following us. Still there was no call for alarm and I relaxed my shoulders – hidden where we were there was no way they would find us. \n\n“I thought you said they were going to be here?” Asked the second voice, a deeper voice.\n\nMalik did not respond and I knew that they were at a loss. We would wait them out if need be, slip out at first light or before, and take the long way around to Farolan, easy – but then a piercing noise short out from my left….. a whistle.\n\nThe boy lying next to me has woken at the sound of the second voice….the voice which he heard before the man brutally murdered his parents, the voice he heard before his life was forever altered. I turned to the boy his face trembling and white, tears streaking down his face with the memories of everything he had lost, looking at me, waiting for me to save him.  \n\n\nMy blood ran red with fire and without a hesitation I stood up and fired a single arrow into the darkness towards the second voice…..tonight I would balance the scales.  \n  \n\n",

Norril tinkers with the door and he's able to unlock it, and get his thieves tools around to unbar it. After a long, tense wait, they sneak into the pitch black building and decide to check out the basement first. They notice the tower is a bit steamy, moist, warm...  \nIn the basement they find a source of the heat, a large coal-fed boiler with slaves chained nearby, shoveling coal into the boiler. The slaves explain that the Bandit King likes it warm and muggy, something about his natural environment. The players arm and free the slaves with spears and handcrossbows, telling the slaves that this basement just became the staging point for an escape, they will free the other slaves and send them here. The slaves agree to wait and hold the room, if things go poorly they'll chuck the weapons in the fire and rechain themselves, else they will help the PCs get all the slaves out.  \nThe PCs try to move silently and sneakily upstairs and as Norril reaches the second floor he discovers an ambush, both parties are aware of each other now and combat starts. The Khaasta up here heard the door open and readied themselves for battle. Half with nets, switching to scimitar and shield after, half with crossbows. There were 8 Khaasta, 4 net and melee, 4 crossbow, and a hidden \"taskmaster\" he had some rogue levels, so he was sneak attacking with his magic whip and started in stealth. The room had 6 marble pillars that were used for cover.  \nI'll explain what everyone did in the fight, rather than a blow for blow.  \nNorril snuck up, summoned magic daggers and stabbed folk with his legacy sword.  \nKurask flew around on the Drakkensteed (ride checks, 20ft ceilings) and lanced the crossbowmen, that fired at him.  \nStanley also flew about and helped with the crossbowmen, lancing them with eldritch blasts. He was shot, but he didn't feel it (still did damage) in his paralyzed legs.  \nRoku got unlucky and had a net thrown on top of him... which basically took him out the fight.  \nFortinbras went toe-to-toe with the taskmaster once he came out of stealth with his massive whip sneak attack that dealt a bunch of non-lethal to him. I believe he crit with a claw and ripped the Taskmaster's throat out.  \nAzrael threw about some spells, realised he'd messed up his spell selection and we chatted between session 8 and 9 about letting him fix it. Otherwise in the combat he mostly used shocking grasp through his dog...which was very effective. Norril \"sniffed\" the taskmaster's corpse, and took the whip as it seemed very expensive. (Avarice Domain).  \n  \nIt was not a subtle fight, subsequently when the players entered the Bandit King's chambers he was ready for them. He welcomed them and asked if they wishes to trade. He lay on a pile of coins, one of the players likened him to a mini dragon on a mini hoard, and he didn't like the comparison. He ordered his two horse sized Iguana to attack and took up his weapon.  \nThe Bandit King was a Khaasta with levels in Warlock and Dragon Shaman and a sort of \"practised spellcaster\" for invocations allowing him to both breathe acid for 3d6 damage, reflex half, or toss out Eldritch blasts at 3d6 as a touch attack. he had a number of other tricks too. He wielded a Golden Crystal Mace (Frystalline, Elysium crystals that counts as good aligned) that shifted and shimmered (Tessellating, Swift action to set it to Bludgeon, Piercing or Slashing) in one hand and had an animated, mithril, githcraft shield floating by his other.  \nNorril used a scroll he had picked up earlier to cast dominate animal on one of the iguana and sent it after the other. Stanley began to have an Eldritch Blast competition with the Bandit King, and they traded eldritch energies whilst everyone else focused on bringing the two iguana down, except Roku who charged the Bandit King, he swung but his [Kusarigama](http://img4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20121226081734/ninjagaiden/images/6/64/KGNG3.png) cut through an illusion instead.  \nNow, once per round as an immediate action The Bandit King could teleport 50ft and leave behind a major image of himself that lasted until his next turn. He would then proceed to make hide checks behind the pillars in his room. It's a modified Flee the Scene invocation.  \nThe fight became a bit of a cat and mouse affair, the Bandit King handed out damage in spades, focusing his Eldritch Blasts on Stanley, or breathing acid over a cluster of 3 or more party members if possible.  \nEventually the party killed the Iguana and then the dominated iguana broke free of the enchantment just in time to receive a lance to the face and be killed in one hit from a charging paladin.  \nThe group focused on the Bandit King, but he was losing ground now, his health low he surrendered but his plea for mercy fell on deaf ears, I mean he was a bandit and a slave trader. Roku stepped forward to deal the killing blow, triggering his readied action to spit acid over four of the party... This is when I found out that the Paladin's Drakkensteed has evasion... and the Paladin failed his save... so the mount's Paladin Shield absorbed all the acid damage leaving the mount unscathed. The Cleric however was brought low. Roku still drove his Kusarigama forth and it shattered the illusion that the Bandit King left behind, he had teleported to the stairs and was going to make a run for it... but it was Azrael's turn and he hit him with a huge ball of electricity that was more overkill than it was regular kill. I described the body being hurled like a rag doll and Azrael looked very pleased with himself.  \nThe party then looted the Bandit King's corpse... taking his weapons, armour, shield and jewelry, even his crest gems. Then the coins were shovelled into the bag of holding, the chest was ransacked and a myriad of potions were claimed. Also the plot mcguffin, the thief of charms that can steal people's beauty was reclaimed...as well as a lot of bottled beauty.  \nMagic items of note inside the chest:  \n1. Platinum coin of returning, spend the coin, roll d100, 1-99 returns in 1d4 hours, 100 it doesn't return.  \n2. Mithril Dragon Statue, answers questions asked in Draconic randomly, 50/50 yes/no  \n3. Feather token anchor.  \n4. An Eldritch Tome for the warlock with the secrets of converting flee the scene into an immediate action, should he try to decipher it.  \nThere were also some mundane treasures, a 3 quarters of a shattered paladin's hilt (very famous paladin in this setting), a chess set, gems, trinkets. scrolls.  \n  \nOverall a good haul. Although the party don't take the expensive tapestries, rugs or gold chandelier I mentioned.  \n  \n**Session 9**  \n  \nWith the loot distributed rashly but fairly the party start objective 2, free the slaves. They sneak around to the pens but Fortinbras's armour gives them away...not horribly but the Khaasta come over to see what the shiny thing in the rocks was...so no surprise. Similar tactics here, 3 crossbowmen, 3 sword and board. The party make reasonably quick work of them, get inside and free the slaves. They are quite far from the Barracks, Fortinbras sends Nero to go check to make sure no one at the Barracks seems alerted, all seems quiet.  \nThe party instruct the slaves to go in groups of three to the tower and go downstairs to the basement and wait. The first two groups of three strip the Khaasta guards and don the weapons and armour. The next couple of groups are instructed to go upstairs and do the same on the fallen Khaasta. Eventually everyone is back at the basement and 18 of the slaves are armoured and have weapons (out of 52) and there are also 2 Dryads that were captured. The party don't want them to fight, but it's preferable to have them ready to if need be.  \n  \nThe party go ahead and sneak past the stables (which is like 300ft from the wall, so it's not hard) and find the portal. The Portal room is a 50ft long chamber with two bunkers at the end and a portal in the middle. There are four greatcrossbow men inside and the room is basically a killbox.Roku burrows in, but can't get inside the bunker's \"worked stone\", so he prepares himself very close to the arrow slit with one of Fortinbras's eggshell grenades. Azrael ducks around the corner and chucks a ball of lightning into Room 1, it explodes and the crossbowmen mount their crossbows. Room 2 reacts also. Roku chucks in the grenade and blinds one of the Khaasta in Room 2 for a round.  \nStanley flies in and lays behind some rocks, tossing out an Eldritch Blast as he does so.  \nLong and short, Azrael throws another lightning ball and kills Room 1, Room 2 are able to dish out some hefty punishment once they get their shit together. They did 2 attacks per round at 2d8+2 and they hit with a +10. To hit them back with ranged weaponry involved shooting through a huge amount of cover...  \nThey shot Stanley in the back for a critical 24 damage, on the same round they shot a 10hp Fortinbras, now Stanley was on around half health which is in the 20 range. Fortinbras very in characterly (Lawful Good) uses his immediate action heal on Stanley, saving him from negatives. I then describe the bolt heading for Fortinbras barely clipping him, but leaving a dent in his armour (5hp) I had rolled a 1 and a 2 on damage dice and he was pretty relieved.  \n  \nAzrael's blink dog wandered through the wall into the bunker, bit one of the crossbowmen and delivered a (electric substitution) combust, electrocuting him and setting him on fire. The last crossbowman took an arrow to the head from one of the party and dropped. The party was able to claim one greatcrossbow that hadn't been warped or burnt by magic.  \n  \nThe party then got the slaves from the tower and 3 by 3 escorted them to the portal. When they got out the headed for the town of Crux, whilst the party escorted the Dryads back home. The former slaves promised to put in a good word for the Heroes that slew the Khaasta Slavers.  \n  \nBack at the Dryad's haven they get drunk on mead, honey wine and sap ale. Stanley is presented with Treebrother. A legacy staff (requirements changed), that allows him to cast Shilelagh 1/day as a swift action and Barkskin 1/day.... eventually if he researches it he can use it to transform into an Ent.. but he doesn't know this. It also marks them as friends of the Dryads...which might be handy in place of a diplomacy check down the line.  \n  \nWe ended the session here, I think my players might want to check out Crux next session. It was a lot of combat... I think the next few sessions will have more RP to balance the scale.  \n  \n[Next Session.](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2iujxk/saving_a_soul_from_hades_part_five_dd_35e_e6/)",

        "text": "This happened a few months ago, during a relatively short campaign (only 5 sessions total) with some new friends; we were testing out a tabletop game system I had custom built as basically a simplified D&amp;D mixed with Fire Emblem ideas of skills. Here are three ways my system managed to be utterly broken;\n\nDue to bad wording of a Knight class skill, called 'Wonder Guard', the party became immune to a minor-boss' attacks. 'Wonder Guard' originally had the descriptive text, \"Roll 1d20; if higher than the accuracy score of a ranged attack, neutralise the ranged attack.\" The problem was, a 'ranged attack' isn't properly defined, and the boss' only method of attack was by using a powerful magic attack that had a penalty to accuracy so that the boss wasn't able to two-shot the players right away. \n\nTo put it simply, the boss didn't get a single hit in during that 30 turn battle, and died in two hits.\n\nSecondly, another class skill, this time 'Blood Rage' for the Berserker class. The original description was \"whenever you are reduced to below 50% hp, get a free attack on all enemies within range\". Now, the problem here is that there was nothing stopping the team healer from healing the Berserker above 50% hp each time, meaning Blood Rage could be triggered every single turn.\n\nEverything died until that one was patched.\n\nThirdly, this time not a skill, but a feature of a cursed sword. The swords curse was something like \"anything stabbed by this sword cannot have its health lowered below 1hp\". Once again, because I was more concerned about concise descriptions rather than properly balanced ones, the moment the players discovered this, the Knight (the tank of the group) became impossible to kill. How? \n\nThe Berserker stabbed the Knight through his chest with the sword and left it in there; this meant that the Knight couldn't get to 0hp and be knocked out\n\nBasically, I was really bad at balancing my own system, but I let all of this happen because it was utterly brilliant at the time.",

        "text": "Tl;dr at the bottom.\n\nSo in my university's tabletop games club, the leader of the club writes his own rpg. During 36 hours event at the university, we played a one shot session in his homebrew setting.\n\nTo put the fluff simply : \nThe setting is pretty much feodal japan style, with few people knowing how to read, and a few elements of fantasy in. Magic is very rare, to obtain it you must kill creatures that are basically the god's pets. There's a specific kind of forbidden magic that has horrible effects when used, so every nation unanimously condemns it.\n\nThe session involves 2 groups of players. Each group plays a squad of level 1 recruits from a different country's army. Both nations are in a cold ward standoff, a small incident could degenerate in an all out war. My group is in the Fire Nation, the others are the River People. In each group (of 4 players), there was one traitor. The traitors were from the High People, another nation who wanted the Fire Nation and River People to just decimate each other so they could conquer us both in the aftermath.\n\nThe idea was to have both group conduct a scenario of their own, leading to each group learning a specific set of information. That was part 1, set to last something like 3 hours. Part 2 would regroup both groups as negotiators, and we would play the thing out in a blaze of roleplaying glory.\nNote that the players had no idea that would happen.\n\nThe goals from each group were as follows :  \n- Fire Nation : Some spy was apparently a double agent. He turned himself over to the River People. He has a great deal of sensitive information : find him, bring him back alive for questionning.  \n- River People : The Fire Nation's army is massing near the River People's borders. Get to town X, find out the army's position in some way, asses its forces, eventually sabotage a few things, and come back to report.  \n- Traitors : SABOTAGE! the whole thing ie : kill the spy, and prevent them from damaging the army.\n\nThe scenario was really complex, with many different outcomes depending on what info the teams found, and what the traitors did. \n\n\nNow, onto the story. The particular guy was on the River People team. His alias is Real, and I've played with him for a while (He was Orok in my homebrew Skyrim campaign, for those who remember that), and he's a nice guy. Always comes up with cool ideas, good roleplay, but he's in general very reserved. The kind of guy who'd be happy to just stand back and watch the other guys come up with the plan.\n\nBut not this time.\n\nSo the blue team leaves their military camp, and travel to town X to find the red army's whereabouts. Halfway through the trip, they're talking about what to do and where to start looking when they reach the city. That\"s where Real goes : \"Hey, DM, that's supposed to be a big army, right? Like hundreds of men, with soldiers and everything?\"  \n\"Yep.\"  \n\"And they're moving pretty secretely, avoiding the roads and towns as much as possible, right?\"  \n\"Yea..?\"  \n\"Then they would either be carrying a huge amount of supplies, or they would have to find food and drinks on the road. Is there a river or lake around?\"  \n*DM puts out map of the region that their commander gave them. There's only one river nearby.*  \n\"Well, they wouldn't set camp more than a miles away from the river. Otherwise it would just be too cumbersome for everyone. Let's just follow the river for a day or two, we're bound to find something.\"\n\nSo they avoided the town entirely, and sure enough they found the encampment after a few hours of walk.\n\nThe funny part is they didn't even win in the end. There were loads of clues in the town about how better prepared and trained our army was, and that a few thousands soldiers were coming behind. Bottomline : they would just get plain decimated in an all out war.\nNot knowing all that, and having only seen the forward troup of a few hundred man, they came to the negotiations overly confident, mocking the fire team every step of the way. So the fire nation completely facerolled them, only to get facerolled in return by a sneak attack from the High People.\n\nTL;DR : Group tasked to find an army. By clever pratical thinking, the silent guy of the groups reasons that an army needs to drink : proceeds to follow the river and stumble upon their camp in a few IG hours, instead of an IG week of investigating the nearby town for clues.",

        "text": "Alright, so, I've posted here once before, concerning my first time playing Shadowrun 5E. I did not get to play that run again because I moved to college before we could continue it. This is the story of my first time GMing, and my first run with a new group of people. \n\nDRAMATIS PERSONAE\nBlake -  Elf weapons specialist with a katana, an AK, a sniper rifle, and a big fucking revolver\nReid - Dwarf, somewhat tanky, has an axe and a crippling allergy to precious metals, partner of Bruce\nBruce - 7 foot tall elf magician, terribly emaciated, has no weapon skills, and is incredibly squishy, but can kill the fuck out of shit. Has a moderate deepweed addiction\nRoxanne - Elf, sort of a mix between a street samurai and a face, has cyber hands and a katana. Bruce's dealer. Charisma out the ass, and a penchant for the most painful puns ever to exist. Despite the puns, shares the role of the straight man with Blake\nVox -  Motherfucking Vox. Human, prejudiced against other metatypes. Owns a lot of guns and a truck. Player is in character 100% of the time, and also generally has an idea of what's going on more than the other characters. \n\nFor this session, Bruce's player lost his character sheet, and so we decided he was too high to really function, and was succumbing to the forces of gravity on his and Reid's couch.\n\nAlright, on to the run: \nRoxanne receives an email from her fixer containing an address, a time, and the word \"pentagram.\" After some debate, the party decides to head to the address. They arrive a little early and scope out the place, it's in a shady back alley in Pioneer Square. The party knocks on the door, and are greeted by a massive troll demanding a password. With a little deduction, the party says \"pentagram,\" which is (no shit) the password. \n\nThe group enters the room, which is dimly lit, and occupied by the troll and a man seated at a table. The man offers the PCs to sit, and they do. He introduces himself as Mr Davidovich. Davidovich works for a group of Russians wishing to establish a business importing a product, but the Yakuza currently have a monopoly on its import and distribution in Seattle. He offers the players 10,000 nuyen to disrupt the Yakuza import business, and another 3,000 to set up a distribution deal. The party gladly accepts the offer, and are handed a folder with information, including the contact information of an informant within the Yakuza, the location of a warehouse on the waterfront where the product is moved through, and general info on two gangs: the Green Dragons, who control the distribution of the product in question (bliss, for those not in the know, this is 6th world heroin), and the SoDo Locos, a gang whose turf is immediately south of that of the Green Dragons, and who deal primarily in Kamikaze (PCP), but who want to expand their turf and dealing operations. \n\nAfter discussing the plan at a Denny's, the PCs take a cab to SoDo, which is an industrial area, and look for any suspicious/shady looking characters. After about 5 minutes of dicking about, the PCs run into a rather shady ork, who offers to sell the party Kamikaze, and brings them back to a den of sorts, where he deals out of. After Vox, Reid, and Roxanne buy several hits of Kamikaze, it comes up that this ork is a member of the SoDo locos, wherein Roxanne brings up the party's plan.\n\nThe party's plan: negotiate a deal with the SoDo Locos to expand their turf into Pioneer Square and the waterfront by \"removing\" the Green Dragons, in exchange for distributing Russian bliss. \n\nThe ork calls his higher-up, who talks to Raul, the head of the SoDo Locos, and a meeting is arranged. The group then piles into the ork's shitty compact car and blast Fortunate Son by CCR on the way to a bar, where the ork executes a perfect handbrake turn into a parking space. Roxanne and Reid go inside, Roxanne getting a surprising success at concealing her katana, while Vox and Blake keep an eye on the car. Roxanne, Reid, and the ork have a couple drinks, and are shown into the back room, where Raul is sitting at a desk. Raul is a troll with a cyber-arm and a taste for Kamikaze and unmitigated violence. After some finagling and a handful of bad puns that led to Raul loading his shotgun in a threatening manner, a deal was struck. Raul would push into Pioneer Square on two conditions. 1) he was guaranteed a constant supply of bliss to distribute, and 2) Samson, the man in charge of the Green Dragons, ceased to be alive. \n\nRoxanne and Raul shake on the deal immediately before the ork bursts in and declares that Knight Errant is on the way. Raul starts screaming that he was sold out and that Roxanne is a narc while he points a shotgun at her. Somehow (Roxanne was lucky as fuck with the dice tonight) she manages to talk him down, and he takes a hit of Kamikaze and charges outside, where he immediately drops one of the seven KE agents outside. \n\nRaul soaks a tremendous amount of SMG fire the whole fight, while Reid kills two KE agents with his axe, Roxanne drops another with her katana, Vox takes an agent's SMG and dumps ten rounds into a pair of agents, injuring one before he critical glitches and breaks the weapon, and Blake puts a round into one at point blank with his revolver, which doesn't get through the agent's armor (note, I gotta scale that shit back next time). Vox then draws his shotgun, and kills one agent while Raul drops the one next to him, leaving one agent remaining, who dives back into his car and floors the accelerator to get the fuck out. \n\nRaul then walks into the bar, hands an ebony credstick to the owner, and throws him into the street before lighting the entire building on fire. Raul then faces the party and says \"here's my number, call me when Samson's dead, I'm going to lie down for a week.\" \n\nBecause of the bloodbath, the party earned some notoriety and public awareness, but also got some automatic weapons and a sizeable amount of money. That's all we did this evening. Next session's wednesday night. ",

It's our fourth session of this campaign.\n\nOur wizard got possessed by an ancient, magic crown that belonged to a mummy's tomb that we had raided prior‏.\n\nHe disappeared in the night from my apartment, but didn't have enough money to repair the crown, so he stole several things from my apartment to make up the difference, which included my favorite desk‏. He's an eladrin, so he just teleported it out‏.\n\nFor reference, by the way, my PC is a 7'5'', 350+ pound hulk of a minotaur fighter‏. Keep this in mind.\n\nIn any case, the wizard got the money and repaired the crown and gained its power. In other words, his skin started glowing, his eyes went white, and he gained +5 to all rolls and the ability to dominate people's minds. He started gaining followers from the inn, and his hunger for power kept growing‏. So he wanders around town and makes several low rolls, failing to gain any followers besides three. He loses one after a crit fail. He tries to dominate the owners of Shark's Loans (who he could have gotten the money from without stealing the desk, but didn't trust), The Black Cauldron (armory/blacksmith), and a tavern. He fails each time.\n\nWe all wake up. I find that my desk and annoying houseguest are missing. I swear vengeance and meet up with the rest of the party. We go to the tavern from last night's dinner where the wizard actually began (we didn't know at the time) his failure of a rampage. We wake the barkeep up (the wizard put everyone to sleep to try and pickpocket them to get enough cash to repair the crown) and he tells us that our friend came through here and did some weird shit while glowing like a firework‏.\n\nSo at this point, the wizard is fairly annoyed and/or depressed...and hungry. So he goes to a place that our DM had previously established in the session to be present in the city: White Castle, sliders chain. He leaves Black Cauldron, which is across the street from the tavern, and rounds the corner. Our druid, who had been waiting outside the tavern while we did stuff, notices him and follows. He stands outside and stares as the wizard goes into White Castle. At this time, the wizard tries to dominate the White Castle employees...and succeeds.\n\nThey give him their entire stock of sliders, which amounted to about 25 lbs. of sliders. His two mind slaves carry them out for him as he munches.‏ The druid confronts him and persuades him to go find the rest of the party. The wizard agrees, and they return to Black Cauldron to see if there's anything interesting there in the meantime. The druid waits till he's inside, then slams the door shut and runs to get the rest of the party, which is now by White Castle.‏\n\nThe minotaur is the first to storm into Black Cauldron. He - I - is /extremely/ pissed at the wizard who stole his favorite fucking desk. The wizard rolls to dominate him...and immediately succeeds. The minotaur is quickly pacified with two heaping armfuls of White Castle sliders for breakfast. The bard, who is outside and behind the minotaur, sees his friend suddenly stop in place. He asks if everything's alright, to which the pacified minotaur replies, \"We're all good in here, honey!\"\n\nThe word \"honey\" is not in the minotaur's vocabulary and he in fact hates the stuff.\nIn the meantime, the rogue, who is the minotaur's bounty hunting partner, comes in and asks the wizard what's going on. He sees the crown on the wizard's head, and the heaps of white castle's sliders around him. The rogue asks what the fuck is up, and the wizard proclaims himself as the King of White Castle.\n\nThe rogue's passive insight is 10. The wizard rolls a bluff of 10. The rogue and druid believe him.\n\nAnyways, the rogue is still extremely skeptical, but believes him...or at least believes that /he/ believes it (the wizard was...eccentric at best). But just to be sure, the wizard rolls to dominate him, and succeeds‏. Right now, only the bard, the bemused druid, and their aunt, the local Elf Sorceror with an intelligence score of 5, are left unbewitched.‏ The aunt is staring at the \"shiny man with burgers,\" but the others drag her away when I stand up to force them out (as the King of White Castle needs his privacy)‏.\n\nMeanwhile, the bard takes a quick detour to White Castle and comes back wearing a paper crown. He proclaims himself the EMPEROR of White Castle and demands to be allowed in. He rolls a bluff that just barely meets the wizard's passive insight and is momentarily allowed in. There is a brief exchange in which the bard tries to get the wizard to take the crown off, Magic Duel-style, but he's not having it. So the bard is sent packing. Meanwhile, the druid has taken up position on a nearby rooftop with a sling and a smooth, polished stone.\n\nThe wizard, having failed to dominate the /extremely/ annoyed owner of the Black Cauldron, is asked to leave. The minotaur stands protectively by him, basically acting as a bodyguard. But as soon as the druid has a clear shot, he rolls to try and snipe the crown off of the wizard's head‏. He rolls an 18+2 = 20 vs. AC. The crown clatters to the ground and all mind control is instantly gone.\n\nPicture this:\n\nThe wizard's crown has just been knocked off. The rogue, who was just being mindcontrolled, is standing behind him with a dagger at the ready. The minotaur, who has just remembered not only that he was being controlled, but that the wizard /stole his favorite desk and tried to bribe him with sliders/, gets pissed.\n\nReally. Fucking. Pissed.\n\nHe uses up a daily action to, instead of with an axe, use his fists to clobber the wizard in the face for 3[W] damage. He rolls and easily hits the wizard's puny AC. The wizard takes 3d6+5 damage. The wizard goes down to 5 HP. The rogue, who is behind him, pissed off, and feeling extremely betrayed and/or violent, decides that it's stabbing time. He uses up his daily, \"Torturous Strike,\" and combines it with Sneak Attack for a total of /25 damage on a level 2 wizard/.\n\nThe wizard is killed instantly.\n\nAn assembly of guards comes up and demands to know why we're murdering people in the street...but luckily, there's a large gaggle of people around who saw the weird glowy guy shouting weird things at people and generally causing a public disruption. So we escape, and take the crown to a nice, secluded place outside of town. I split it in half with my greataxe. The soft gold breaks easily. The sorcerer follows it up with an acid orb to melt the remains in exchange for the promise of more sliders.\n\nFinally, the bard decides that he wants to use \"Vicious Mockery\" on the crown to end its life. The DM says that it will only take effect if a natural 20 is rolled. The bard insults the crown's remains vigorously, calling it the child of a \"golden chastity belt\" and a \"goblin's nipple piercing.\" And then rolls a natural 20.\n\nLights out, close curtains, exit stage right.",

        "text": "I was asked by my friend to regale you with the tale of the \"Cult of the Pillowcase\".\n\nNow, I have a rather shoddy memory for the small details, but this is one of the stories that sticks out in my mind for its sheer hilarity. I may or may not be getting the dungeon confused with another, but I'm preeety sure it was this one. (System was 3.5 D&amp;D by the way, i think i was supposed to mark that somehow in the title)\n\nThe party consisted of (and I may be missing some) a half orc 'bard' whose bardic art was comedy, an overly stupid fighter who was proficient in improvised weapons (many a door was ripped from its hinges that campaign), a Hengeyokai Shugenja that had the form of a collie dog (from oriental adventures sourcebook), and our monk named Johnny Kubrakai (if you're not keen on your pop culture, this is a reference to the enemy of the Karate Kid)\n\nSo i made this dungeon... It was full of the usual ghosts and ghoulies and the occasional floating head. It was sort of an abandoned castle built into the side of a mountain. I had been hard pressed for time in creating this dungeon, so I had neglected to put loot in. Luckily, my friend /u/inorganicangelrosiel and I put a lot of time into making a random loot generator.\n\nThat day however, the random loot generator was not being nice. It gave nothing but gold, gems, and standard boring weapons. The players started getting a little loot hungry. They began looking EVERYWHERE for loot, every nook and cranny, and when they found nothing, they started taking random shit. So at one point, they found a room with a lot of beds, and decided they were going to raid the pillowcases. The shoved like 8 pillowcases in their bags.and moved on to the next room. They finally did get treasure after the next fight (said floating head) and they moved on to the next fight of the dungeon. Now, most of the players were melee focused. The exception being the shugenga which was basically our wizard. This next boss had an aoe fear attack that made everyone who came within 30 feet of him flee in terror. The problem with that was, the fear took up the ENTIRE ROOM, and in order to attack him/proceed in the dungeon, you had to go in the room. Well, the issue here was, everyone was sucking with their roles this day, and every time someone would walk into the room, they would fail their will save and run out of the room screaming like babies. The wizard got in a few spell hits, but in a few turns she exhausted her ranged spells and was forced to try running in and hitting it with her staff, but never got there and ran out screaming.\n\nAfter almost 10 turns of this, with not a single attack being landed on him in several turns (though the monster not doing all too much damage back either) the monk has a bright Idea. \"I can't be afraid of what I can't see\" he said, and pulled one of the pillow cases out of his pack and placed it over his head. This monk did not have blind fight mind you, but he charged in to the room completely blind with the pillow case on his head and, lo and behold, passed his will save. Then started flailing blindly with his flurry of blows and starts whalloping on the enemy, hitting each time. The other players sat in awe as for a second turn the monk passed his will save and hit the enemy. The fighter shrugged and put a pillow case over his head and ran in... He too passed the will save and was able to hit the monster. The rest of the party followed suit, and suddenly everyone was passing their will saves. These were just regular run of the mill pillowcases. A bit soiled even from their time long spent unused, gathering dust and mildew, yet here the party was, wearing them on their heads, and kicking the shit out of a fear demon.\n\nThey killed it in swift order, and for that I felt the need to run the randomizer until some sweet loot dropped for them, cause they deserved it.... But it didn't end there....\nThe next fight, they cut out holes for their eyes and ran into battle with the pillowcases on their head. Battle after battle after battle. Their luck was never shit again that entire campaign... Thus the cult of the pillowcase was born. At one point, they even began praying to the pillowcase gods.\n\nWhen new people joined the campaign, they convinced the new people of the power of the All Mighty Pillow Case, and new followers were accepted into the cult as true believers... This went on the entire campaign as a running joke/plot device  and was the most fun and memorable campaign I have ever been a part of.",

        "text": "Hello again. It is I, the (in this instance) fairly dickish DM of a one-on-one evil campaign. If you've read [Part 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2ga3es/dd_35_did_i_mention_that_i_dont_like_dming_evil/), or if you have read the title of this post, then you already know that I don't particularly care for running evil campaigns. So, in what might have been a bit of unfair DMing, I set a new player against challenges appropriate to his level (13).\n\n[Part 1, if you want to catch up.](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2ga3es/dd_35_did_i_mention_that_i_dont_like_dming_evil/)\n\nAfter his captivity at the hands of the Cuthbertine order and freshly *geased*, Player is given a horse to ride on, some travel rations and supplies, an intentionally vague map to the village of his latest victim (essentially a one use map, no pillaging villages of importance once his mission was complete), and, of course, the remains of his victim, an elf merchant hailing from a northern village.\n\nOnce he sets out, Player immediately tries to test the limits of his *geas*. He turns South and rides, starting to feel a magical discomfort (the beginning of the spells effects, 3d6 damage per day and the potential to become sickened) as he does so. Once he turns back North, however, the sensation stops, and he resigns himself to his quest.\n\nHis destination is about a weeks ride, not accounting for being sidetracked or attacked (which happened), so Player has a fair amount of time to think about what he's done. Which he did for about two seconds, before shifting gears and planning his vengeance against the paladins and clerics who tortured him and sent him on his quest.\n\nIt's a decent plan, if a bit of a step-for-step copy of the plan from most BioWare games (go help your allies, get them to lend some forces to your eventual glorious assault), but hey. First time evil (wannabe) overlord.\n\nAnyway, a day or two later, Player sees chimney smoke in the distance and rides towards it. He is stopped a few hours out by a strange rumbling beneath his horse, startling the creature. He looks around for the source, correctly assuming that it wasn't an earthquake, and spots a dust trail approaching from the plains. He readies himself for combat, grabbing his lance and dribbling some poison down its length.\n\nThis is part two of my dickish DMing, by the way. The first part was his treatment at the hands of the Curhbertines. You see, it seemed to me that he was expecting to run up against humanoid enemies, for the most part. So, with that thought in mind, I revealed the threat in a shower of dirt.\n\nRising out of the ground before him was a purple worm. I shower him a picture for reference.\n\nPlayer immediately said \"Nope,\" turned his horse around, and groaned in frustration as the geas started nagging him again. He turned the horse around again, charged, and knocked off a fair chunk of hit points.\n\nOn the worms turn, it hit his horse with a bite (thinking that horse and rider were one creature, and knocking Player to the ground in the process) and swallowed it whole. Fortunately for the quest, the remains of his victim fell off the horse as well, suffering only a crack.\n\nGetting to his feet and abandoning the lance, Player draws his sword and holds an action.\n\nThe purple worm attacks, triggering the action and getting a nice slice from Player.  They exchange blows for a while, before the worm succeeds on a grapple, and swallows Player whole.\n\nThis became a theme, by the way.\n\nPlayer cuts himself free in short order and returns to combat, slimy and disgusted. Unfortunately, the worm also passes its next check, and swallows him again.\n\nAgain, he cuts himself out, and the worm falls shortly after, but not before delivering an awesome blow and sending him flying.\n\nSlightly upset about his horse, but figuring that he can just take another one at the village ahead, he gets to butchering the worm for the contents of its digestive tract (a few pounds of fairly valuable stone) and its stinger (STR damaging poison, Fortitude DC 25).\n\nOnce he tidied himself up a bit and gathered the remains of his victim, Player heads towards the town.\n\nWhere he is lauded as a hero for slaying the beast that had plagued the community for months. A number of farmers practically worshiped him for saving them from a shitty fate (:D).\n\nI pulled out all the stops, trying my best to guilt trip him into atoning. He took it in stride, however, accepting the praise and the rewards for his efforts, as well as a healthy share of the feast that was thrown in his honor that night.\n\nThe next morning, however, he merrily steals a horse and continues his journey, telling me that he plans on coming back to conscript the entire population into his as-yet nonexistent army.\n\nI shake my head sadly, and we both go home for the day. I roll up stats for a few more challenges, hoping to test his *creative* problem-solving skills in next few games.\n\n~To Be Continued.~\n\n[Part 3 here!](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2glyev/dd_35_did_i_mention_that_i_dont_like_dming_evil/)",

        "text": "Okay. Let me preface this tale by saying that, yes, I was a bit of a dick in this instance. Let me also preface this by saying that my player said that he had read through the rules before playing. I know that I should probably never believe something like that from a completely new player, but I was just running this game to kill time at work, so there you go.\n\nThe Setting (IRL): A Navy base (I was working in security at this time, and there is a lot of time to BS during a 12 hour shift (I worked 12 straight, the other guys rotated out on 4 hour shifts. Hooray for being qualified for positions of authority!). I play with a group composed of my shipmates, so we talk about D&amp;D fairly often.\n\nOne of the guys (let's call him Player, since he's the only one playing) is interested in playing, but he's never available outside of work. So, we come to the conclusion that we can roll dice with our iPhones when we get an opportunity (bathroom breaks, shift changes, lulls in traffic, etc.) and just use narrative to drive the game otherwise.\n\nA bit about me. I offer some choices to my players whenever we start a new campaign. First, what level do you want to be? Some of the more experienced guys want to jump right into the action, without dealing with that pesky \"one attack per round\" phase.\n\nThe second choice, to gestalt, or not to gestalt. Since I often play with very small groups, this option gives a lot of room for character development. It also allows me to let go of the reigns a bit, since I don't necessarily need to create an NPC to fill empty roles for the party.\n\nSo, we discuss a bit, and Player decides to play gestalt, level 13 (I talked him down from 20). Then he tells me he wants to be an evil gestalt paladin||assassin. Red flag #1. He is eventually shown the Blackguard PrC, and opts to go Paladin 10 (for the bonus blackguard abilities)/Blackguard 3 on one side, and straight Fighter on the other (until he qualifies for Assassin).\n\nAgain, I let him know my dislike for running evil campaigns during this process, numerous times. But, he wanted to go on a rampage, and would not be denied.\n\nThe Setting (In Game): We open on a fairly industrious city, well fortified against outside threats due to a long history of magical warfare and Game of Thrones flavored, violent regime changes.\n\nThe guards are well trained against magical and mundane attacks, sort of like an Anti-Magic SWAT team. Most of the wealthier people have invested in some sort of magical security (alarm stones, traps designed to deactivate only at their command, etc.). The city is headquarters for the Cuthbertines. I make this known, hoping to give him at least one quest before he burned and pillaged everything. He nods, says the challenge would be more fun, and we get started.\n\nPlayer, apparently not aspiring to do much in his open 13 levels of backstory, makes his living in the back alleys, mugging people, breaking and entering, and murdering on a whim. He says he was good enough at covering his tracks that he had never been caught. So, I dropped a note from the guild of thieves, asking for some help \"securing a shipment,\" and gave him a day to prepare for his journey to the ambush site.\n\nHe spends it breaking and entering.\n\nAfter tailing a reasonably wealthy-looking merchant to his home, he cases the joint, waits for nightfall, and tries to pick the lock. He fails his rolls to perceive or deactivate an electrical trap, sets off said electrical trap, and shakes off the damage. He then continues, not at all worried that this did not bode well, into the house.\n\nThe place is fairly nondescript, but there are a few valuables that he nabs on the first floor. He goes upstairs to find the merchant sleeping in his bed, walks over, and stabs him to death. He then sets about looting the second floor, thinking that he has all the time in the world.\n\nBehind the screen, the merchant succeeded on his perception check to know that someone was in his house, and activated a silent alarm (basically one of many sending stones that was connected to the city guard), and pretended to be asleep, hoping that the guy would just take what he wanted and leave.\n\nThis comes into effect as Player spends ten minutes trying to bash open a chest that he couldn't pick the lock to. The guard comes into the house, I have him roll listen, he fails, and they arrive of the second floor to arrest him. There are only four, but they are about level five, and all carry maces with the merciful enchantment.\n\nNeedless to say, he gets taken down. He expects to die, but I stop him from deleting his sheet.\n\nPlayer wakes up, you see. He wakes up in a featureless cell, strapped to a table. In short order, he is interrogated, knocked out again, and wakes up in a different room, on a different table.\n\nThis time, Player is not spoken to. He is surrounded by observers, and a few of them go through pre-surgical preparations. Hand washing, glove-donning, patient restraining, and tool arrangement.\n\nEventually, he is given water to drink. He spits the first bit into the face of one of the observers, who simply nods and continues to offer until Player drinks his fill. He is then exposed to the golden ice ravage.\n\nHis reactions are documented, and he passes out after a few merciful applications of a light mace.\n\nWhen Player wakes again, he is suspended by his arms, this time in a typical \n dungeon cell. He is greeted by a Paladin, who reveals himself to be one of Players former brothers. What followed was one of the best bits of roleplaying I had seem from Player.\n\nPlayer: \"What do you want from me?\"\n\nPaladin: \"I want to know why. Why you have forsaken your calling. Why you have taken up the path of evil. Why you kill innocent men in their beds. Why?\"\n\nPlayer: \"That's simple. I wanted to be stronger. Paladin training wasn't good enough, so I looked for strength somewhere else.\"\n\nPaladin: \"Yes, look at your great strength. You prey on the innocent for trinkets, you are subdued by simple guardsmen, and you hang in the city dungeons.\"\n\nPlayer: \"I may hang here now, but I am free to take my power by my own hands, while you bow and beg for scraps of it from your god.\"\n\nPaladin: \"There is no future for you down this path, brother. But I cannot kill you, not when I believe you can be saved.\"\n\nPlayer: \"Your beliefs mean little to me. Listen to me. I will get out of here. I will bring the world to its knees. I will conquer hell itself to gain the power I seek. And if you let me go now, I promise to spare your pathetic city until the very end.\"\n\nShaking his head, the Paladin sighed and silently mourned for his lost brother.\n\nThen he called in a cleric, who slapped a geas on him and sent him on a quest of atonement, just so he could justify not executing him.\n\nThe quest? To deliver to body of his last victim to his family, elves who live deep in the mountainous forests to the north, and then await their judgement.\n\n\n~To Be Continued.~\n\n[Part 2 Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2gbmbf/dd_35_did_i_mention_that_i_dont_like_dming_evil/)",

        "text": "***Into the Ruins***\n\n*We only had three Players this week - Chris's Uluku Alchemist, Indy's Human Soldier, and Matt's Nemean Sorcerer. So, we said that the other PCs were staying at the forest pool, scouting around it looking for more tracks and clues while these three head up to the ruined fortress to check it out.*\n\n\nThree of the Heroes head away from the forest pool, following the river until they find the signs of an ancient road. The road is long over-grown, but in places the flagstones are still visible and where it is obscured by grass or vines, the ground is still fairly level. The road eventually starts to rise from the forest floor on a great earthen ramp that mounts the side of the huge hill that supports the ruined fortress. \n\nAs they proceed up the ramp further and further from the river, the trio start to feel uneasy. \n*Due to the differences in rolls and skills, all the characters felt uneasy, two of them felt like they were being watched, and one of them actually spotted a group of lizardmen (Ahl-At-Rab) in the branches of a tree, adjacent to the road, up ahead.*\n\nThe Uluku leapt into the air and readied his weapon, landing in a tree ahead - directly over the heads of four Ahl-At-Rab. The Ahl-At-Rab were armed with heavy spears, javelins, bone daggers, and wooden clubs. No metal; lots of wood, bone, stone, and leather. The combat was short and brutal. Two of the Ahl-At-Rab hit the Uluku with javelins, but in a matter of seconds all four of them were dead without any other injuries to the Heroes. *Those two javelins did do 16 points of damage. The Uluku however has the Hardy Talent, so he's got 26 HP. The soldier killed three of the Ahl-at-rab - two with a thrown spear (not a javelin, a spear) and the other with her gladius. Neither the Uluku nor the Nemean are really combat characters, though they each got up close in combat.*\n\nContinuing up to the ruined fortress, they found that the front gates were missing entirely - apparently salvaged and removed in ages past. A short colonnade (missing the upper floors, but the caryatid columns remained) led to a large courtyard, open to the sky. There was evidence in the courtyard that it had been used as a campsite, perhaps by the Ahl-at-Rab. Bits of broken bone tools, scraps of worthless leather, offal and gnawed bones were pushed into the corners and edges of the space. This was a bit of a contrast to the colonnade that had contained several broken bodies (broken beyond raising obviously or perhaps slain a second time by massive damage from crushing and rending). In the center of the courtyard was a deep pool of water surmounted by some sort of ruined statuary. *The pool seemed to be a vril collector of some kind, but this one was not aspected towards any particular Atman. The Heroes used the water to refresh themselves and clean up after the previous battle and the journey through the jungle.*\n\nFinally, they stood before a pair of huge stone doors that led into the fortress itself. The double doors were massive, easily 5 meters high and 3 meters wide each. There were no hinges evident (the doors seemed to open outwards into the courtyard) but there were a pair of huge iron plates where the doors met one another. \n\nThe Heroes knocked, but could hear neither answer nor echo. They pulled on the great rings of iron set into the doors and found that they swung open easily, obviously counter-weighted with great skill and care when they were originally built. The initial great hallway was dark. There were numerous rooms off of alcoves all along this great hall that did have small, narrow windows, but these let in little light as many trees and vines outside obscured the openings. \n\nMoving inside, the Heroes found a great stone and lintel opening inset with Aenochian runes that seemed invocations and praise to the gods, particularly Shango, the god of war. The hallway beyond this arch (a great hallway, 9 meters high and 5 meters wide) was paved with slabs of polished marbles and its walls were huge sheets of obsidian. Stepping past the arch and into the hallway caused light to blossom in the larger chamber ahead and spread into the hallway. The light was accompanied by a clicking noise (like ceramics tapping together) that rose slowly in volume with some brief pauses. *This actually caused the Players some consternation. They went back and forth through the archway to see if the lights would go out (they did) and then come back on (they did). So, they threw caution to the wind and sent the soldier ahead first with the logic that he at least would be most favored by Shango of the three of them.*\n\nThe larger room inside led to another pair of large doors (slightly ajar). The clicking noise came from a pair of huge mosaic murals on each side of the hexagonal room. The mosaics shifted and moved every 5 seconds or so creating a moving tapestry with scenes of Atlantean military might: Atlantean troops fighting Ahl-At-Rab, troops fighting Lemurians, heroic leaders marshaling scores of Andamen to fight. *There seemed to be a at least a few recurring characters depicted, but none of the Heroes had any skill at Atlantean or Ophiran History and so did not recognize what battles or leaders might have been represented.*\n\nThe area beyond the doors led to sets of stairs leading both up and down.\n\nA quick inspection of the upper floor seemed to be a large tower room with six rooms branching off of it. Two of these rooms had ruined walls, open to the elements beyond. The other four were intact and had larger windows that overlooked the jungle. \n\nThe downward set of stairs led to a large hall off of which seemed to be numerous smaller rooms that the Heroes took to be former barracks and another room that might have been a meeting hall or dining room for troops. \n\nAlso off of the large hall was yet another set of huge doors. However, these were closed and the space in front of them filled with the bodies of numerous Ahl-at-rab, all dead, stacked in front of the door (holding it closed? attempting to claw their way in?).\n\n*GM Notes: Neither Chris's Uluku nor Matt's Nemean are really statted up or equipped for combat. In Matt's case, this is somewhat alleviated by his heavy selection of Modes - he can easily use Manipulate to boost his own skills or weaken/curse others. I think he has the Attack mode as well. Chris's Uluku Owl-chemist, however, is another matter. He has no armor, only carries a dagger and some metal claws (that fit on over his own). Neither are naturally adept at combat (the characters, not the players). However, the Uluku is clearly the best natural investigator among the three with high skills in Investigate, Intuition, and his natural Uluku Perception bonuses. Plus, he can be sneaky if need be. So, he makes a good scout. Also, Indy's Soldier is adept at combat. Indy needs to push a bit more, using Hero Points, Tempting Fate. She was getting the hang of it, but I think with a few more Atlantis combats under her belt, she'll be a force to be reckoned with.*",

        "text": "This is one of my more elaborate stories. We usually keep a running tally of all of the amusing quotes and conversations at the table, but this is one of the few times everything came together so beautifully to make a symphony of mass destruction. Please note that I do not like 4th edition and have a very limited idea of how it works so if this was wrong or not even possible, blame my DM for not correcting me.\n\n**THE SETUP**\n\nwhenever I play D&amp;D I have a few tenants I cling to: I like my spellcasters and I like my drow. This tale requires some build up. My Drow warlock had a pact boon called Darkspiral aura which, in essence, grants a 1d6 (1d8 at 11th level) of damage as a free action for every \"charge\" you build up. A charge is gained whenever an enemy carrying the warlock curse dies. one charge is worth 1 die (2 charges would be 2d6, and so on).\n\nEarlier in our adventure we stumbled upon a wizard's tower. Once we entered, we noticed we were in a laboratory and seeing as how my character was obsessed with explosives and poisons, curiosity got the best of me and I emptied all the potions into my bag of holding, which inadvertently, turned it into a flamethrower, Open the bag, watch flames erupt.\n\nOn another leg of the journey we discovered a magic lamp. Now one thing our DM will do whenever he throws a genie at us is will pick apart every pit of our wording or twist it in ways to get an unintended effect. The DM's wife is a furry to say the least and she immediately asked for a pack of wolves. The genie grants this wife by providing her with a pack of wolf brand cigarettes (a huge stretch I know, but whatever). The thing about these cigarettes though is once the butt touched the ground, it spawned a wolf minion with 1 hp. This was not satisfactory to her at all and the cigarettes ended up cluttered in our pack.\n\nA bit later I discovered a rod of corruption during a fight which allows me to spread my warlock curse to neighboring enemies upon their death and I quickly began searching for ways to put it to use.\n\n**THE PAYOFF**\n\nso we're in a particularly nasty boss fight when I suddenly get a really devious idea. I have our monk remove the cigarettes from his pack and toss them on the ground. There were about 12 cigarettes left and I hit them with my bag of holding flamethrower spawning 12 wolf minions. The first thing I did was cursed one of the wolves who immediately received the first attack of the encounter with its paltry one hp.\n\nNeedless to say, he promptly died and a charge went to Darkspiral aura, but due to the rod of corruption, the curse then spread to every other wolf and before I could even take my first attack, I was able to, as a free action, nail the boss with 12d8 points of damage, emptying my charge pool.\n\nI explained my plan to the DM and she not only cleared it but burst into laughter when she realized how quickly I had trivialized this boss encounter. As I stated above, it's very possible this wasn't something that I could do as my knowledge (and taste) for 4th edition is practically non-existent.\n\nI have linked the DM to this sub and maybe later she'll post one of her stories from before I joined the group that involved pillow cases. It should be a fun little read.",
