I have always used rōmaji to type in japanese as I’ve always found it easier for me. My girlfriend uses the kana keyboard (which I didn’t know was a thing until she showed it to me) and she insists that it’s faster so I’d like some input from you all on what you use and why. We’re both on iOS.\n\nI noticed when I was trying to search for Rick and Morty in japanese 「リック•アンド•モーテｲ」and I couldn’t for the life of me figure out how to type the small ｲ. I did it just now by scrolling all the way to the bottom of the suggested kanji for い",

        "text": "Alright, quick summary of my experience with Japanese:\n\n* Visited Japan in December 2019. To prepare, I learned some basic words and phrases, hiragana and katakana, and maybe 30-40 basic kanji. I really only ended up using こんにちは／こんばんは、ありがとうございます、トイレはどこですか, etc. BUT, I had the absolute time of my life and I decided that I would go back, and that I would properly learn Japanese for next time.\n\n* Didn't really study Japanese the first half of 2020 because I didn't know what resources to use and because I had a lot of other stuff going on. Took an introductory Japanese course in Fall 2020, my last semester of college. My previous studies put me ahead of the rest of the class but not by much. I ended up dropping the course a little while after the midterm because I couldn't balance the workload with my required courses (and I decided I could self study at a faster pace later on).\n\n* First half of 2021 was just like the first half of 2020 - life was (good) busy and I was seriously struggling to choose which resources to use to learn Japanese. \n\n* I really started studying Japanese in earnest in September 2021. I found a Google doc guide on reddit called A Year to Learn Japanese and it really felt like it made sense to me. In short, use Genki for grammar, an essential 2000 Japanese vocabulary Anki deck for vocabulary, and Wanikani for kanji. You get through each of these 3 resources and then you have the foundation in place to go learn from immersion (at least that's roughly what the guide said, it's been a while now since I read it but that's what my approach became at least). \n\n* I followed that approach somewhat consistently (with 3 or 4 1-week breaks for various reasons) for about 8 months, until May 2022. I didn't really do much active immersion, but I would say I got a lot of gradual immersion because I've gotten very into Japanese culture and I have heard a ton of spoken Japanese by now. It didn't really teach me much speech, but I think it helped me develop good pronunciation.\n\n* Then in May I finished both Genki textbooks, and for some reason the bottom fell out of my motivation and I dropped off (maybe because Genki was what made it fun for me). Did zero Japanese studying from May-July this year, then picked it back up August-October, then dropped off again. \n\nSummary of Japanese experience: Genki 1 and 2 done, level 21 in Wanikani, half a college Japanese course, and some TV immersion. \n\nNow I'm finally back in Japan, like I always said I would, and I've been using Japanese as much as possible. I only switch to English if I really can't get through the encounter with Japanese. And I can't explain how motivating this trip has been for me to keep studying Japanese. I certainly don't know a lot and I can only hold the most basic conversations, but being here has given me a chance to finally use what I had been studying for almost a year consistently, and off and on for 3 years. I think a big hindrance to staying motivated was that I was studying in a vacuum. I wasn't using or testing what I learned and I didn't really have the feeling that I was actually progressing. Being here has shown me just how much I've really learned in that time \n\nAlso, I'm sorry to be a little bit meme-y, but I haven't heard 日本語上手 once. Instead, I have been asked by several Japanese people if I live in Japan after they heard my Japanese. I can already hear /r/japancirclejerk getting spun up after that last part, but it was seriously so motivating and validating to be asked that question after spending 3 years wondering if I would ever be able to really speak Japanese at all. \n\nIf anyone else here has been studying Japanese for a bit and struggling to notice progress, or is losing motivation to keep learning, I highly suggest taking a trip to Japan and putting your Japanese to the test.",

This really helps with comprehension and even advanced beginners such as myself can keep up.  I can honestly say that since I've been listening to it, my comprehension skills have increased dramatically.   \nIt covers various topics on Japanese culture and pop culture in general in relation to Japan. It's entertaining, small and intimate and they're always looking for feedback and sincerely encourage their listeners to engage with them. \n\nIf you're looking for content to immerse with that is not purely didactic and that will keep you engaged no matter what level you're at, I highly recommend!",

If you're like me, these kanji all look the same and it seems impossible to ever memorize them. Especially since there are thousands of other kanji with the same problem. I felt hopeless.\n\nUntil I bought the book Remember the Kanji by James Heisig. After reading that one book I can tell the difference between those kanji. Not only that, I can tell the difference between any jyoyo kanji. They all look like different people to me know. \n\nSo if you're like me and you look at that poster with the 2200 jyoyo kanji on it and you know deep down in your jellies that you are going to learn ever one of them, try this book. It changed my life. \n\nCall to action: what do you guys think? RTK - ye or ne?\n\nP.S. A lot of people hate RTK because you don't actually learn Japanese with it. It only teaches you how to recognize kanji based on it's radicals. Also, RTK is EXTREMELY difficult and frankly the most boring study book I've ever used. However, it was also the most effective study book I've ever used. Finishing RTK could easily take up to a year and to this day, 3 years later, I still review the book daily (5 kanji a day).\n\nP.S.S. 水 - water 永 - eternity  泳 - swimming 冰  - I don't know this one actually but I can guess that it means ice because of it's radicals 氷 - ice",

        "text": "I've been having some trouble with studying grammar for my college. Usually I'd take the ajatt or MIA approach, but my tests require this. I know a lot of people know how to study this really well, I'm just so lost lately. I've been struggling for a year and a half, barely passing those tests, it leaves me so exhausted and I can't even enjoy watching media on Japanese. Everyone I ask isn't really precise, or they say it wouldn't work on me. I understand that everyone has their way of studying, I just hope someone is willing to guide me a little bit into the practices behind it. Nevertheless, let me explain the book we need to study from and the tests. \n\nThe book is called: \"初級日本語 下\", it has grammatical structures and then sentence examples right after. Anyone who's ever seen the book will know what I'm talking about. Before every lesson there is a two page dialogue in Japanese that consist of the grammatical structures that will be introduced later on. \n\nNow while it introduces new words, grammar points and when to use what, I seem to have trouble applying and remembering it. The test itself consists of:\n\n1) particles (putting the correct particle on the empty space between the given sentence. I have extreme problems with this).\n\n2) The second one consists of sentences in which there's an empty gap where you can put: verbs, I-adjectives, Na-adjectives, nouns... \nThis one is the hardest for me because I can't remember when to use what and how to apply it. I can easily learn how to conjugate verbs, but practically applying it is the main problem. I don't know how to use it properly and how to recognize stuff. \n\n3) The third one is to make up a question out of a given answer. \n\n4) Translation from Japanese to my native language. \n\n5) Native language to Japanese translation. \n\nIt is worth mentioning that I can translate sentences 99% of the time. I know the words and I understand what it wants, yet I'm unable to put anything in. I am so confused... Any advice? \nThank you in advance!",

Reached till level 19, was very useful in my progress.\n\nFew days ago I discovered KanjiStudy from TokuyuuTV, YouTube, where they talks about how they learned kanji etc etc etc. They mentioned KanjiStudy and I installed it in my phone and started discovering it.\n\nFew things that convinced me to switch to Kanjistudy in the order of my priorities-\n1. Cost effective. Kanji study is cheaper than wanikani. At the moment, just $4.2~ one time subscription.\n2. Good features- KS has flashcards, kanji writing sequence, daily streaks, and a lot more. Definitely, it doesn't mean - to be more efficient, you gotta use all the features it offers. I am anyways gonna just use the flashcards, and daily day streak.\n3. Better dictionary- offers more vocabs to learn along with its kanji.\n4. Customizable sets- Customize your words and kanji in the groups of 'New, seen, familiar, known'. Allows me to revise the words and kanji I am struggling with.\n\nThat's pretty much it. \n\nWanikani's srs is still the dopest tho, でもお金がない😭",

Just a tad difficult sometimes but that's the kind of challenge I like.\n\nI also play Pokemon Midori, which is a bit easy but taught me quite a few nature/animal related terms.

        "text": "Hi!\n\nI've been studying Japanese for about 3 years, and I'm roughly at an N3 level. I'm pretty strong when it comes to grammar, closer to an N2 level because I do a fair amount of reading and grammar sticks with me, but on the other hand I'm pretty weak when it comes to Kanji, and somewhat when it comes to Vocab, both at around an N3 level, maybe on the slightly lower end.\n\nI'm planning on going to Japan for Japanese studies, for a university year 2023-2024, but I wanna make sure that when I get there I have done the most I can to improve my Japanese, so I can make the most out of my time there, and hopefully come back having improved a lot. I've been trying to push my Japanese to a higher level. One way I've done this is reading in Japanese (Manga, novels etc.) but I find my lack of vocabulary/kanji understanding holds me back from having a smoother time reading, and means I spend a lot of time looking up words, only to eventually forget them when I move on to another chapter/book.\n\nI've been trying to use Anki to complement my learning, so that I can actually properly go through this content, and hopefully reach around a N2 level before I go to Japan next year. In particular, I'm using N3-N2 vocabulary/kanji decks. They've been somewhat useful, and sure some of the words I've learnt have actually come up when I read in Japanese, but it also feels like I learn a lot of words which I'll never actually see (some which, even according to native Japanese friends of mine, they'd never ever use/actually see).\n\nThis has me wondering if I'm actually taking the right approach to learning using flashcards. I have a couple of thoughts: \n\n1. Maybe I should be making my own flashcards instead of using ones online. This would definitely help me with enjoying my hobbies/readings more since the vocabulary I learn would be much better suited towards them. This would of course mean I can consume more native material and therefore improve even more. This is the approach I've been considering switching to, but I'm also scared all of the new vocabulary I learn would only reflect the one that is used in manga/novels, and leave me with glaring gaps in knowledge or mean I end up missing vocabulary that will be important either in my time in Japan, conversations about non day to day topics or indeed be a pain when taking the JLPT tests which often cover more obscure words I've heard.\n2. Maybe I'm just using the wrong decks/software, and there's actually decks out there that would be good/useful for my goals and be more reflective of the words I actually need to know. If anyone knows any such decks, please do let me know :3\n\nI was wondering what all of your thoughts were on this? If you've had similar experiences when trying to push your Japanese and improve significantly. Do you have any advice for what I should be/should not be doing? Feel free to ask any questions. Thanks for reading through my long post lmao.",

Adding Te form to the end of a sentence makes it a request.  Replacing the Te with Ta makes it an impolite paste tense or informal. Is there a present tense The form or something? If I got any of that information wrong please let me know \n\nLastly, I feel like I'm making almost no progress. I'm in my last year of highschool and I started studying last year, I didn't study that much only really learn hiragana and katakana and past tense. This year I started again after a long break. I've been trying to do 5 hours a week, one hour a day on week days. I feel like I'm learning nothing. It's been months and I've only really learned adjectives and Te form. Am I studying too little? \n\nI've really been putting off vocabulary but it's more prevalent now in the later chapters of the book. I started using Anki and it's really boring. Any alternatives? Also how much is too much. I also feel like I forget vocabulary very easily. I do the exercises, and then once the new chapter comes around and I stop using the Vocabulary I seem to forget a lot of it. Should I just do more flashcards?\n\nI really feel like I need a teacher so I'll know if I'm studying correctly, or am I just not doing enough?

I've learned the Hiragana and Katakana pretty well so want to move onto the next steps.\n\nI got myself the Genki 1 &amp; 2 textbooks and workbooks, and also have Anki downloaded, but have yet to start working with it. \n\nI have a few questions as follows:\n\n1. In Genki chapters, there are quite a lot of vocab words in the vocab lists provided that are both covered and not covered in the dialogue. Should I be trying to memorise all of these?\n2. As a follow up, should I be using an Anki deck specific to the Genki vocab words to help with memorisation? I have seen many people recommending more general decks such as \"JLPT Tango N5 MIA Omega Deck\", but I'm not sure if it's better to use a general deck like this, or find/create one for the specific words i'll be working through from Genki and it's vocab lists, or be using both decks.\n3. How should my learning be split? Every day, should I be working through a new section of Genki, Learning/revising cards from Anki, and learning Kanji from WaniKani, or should I split these down onto different learning days?\n\nFinally, I have one specific grammer/hiragana question that i've been unable to find the answer to: In Genki 1, there is a question that asks you to select the correct way of writing \"onna no hito\".\na) おんなのひと\nb) おっなのひと　(using chiisai tsu)\nAs far as I am aware, chiisai tsu would indicate the following constonant being pronounced twice, in this case the n from \"na\", thus creating \"onna\". However, in the answer key the correct answer is a), and I can't figure out what the difference would be or why b) is incorrect.\n\nありがとうございます！",

        "text": "A while back I complained about the lack of tools for mining vocab on iOS devices. Android users can run Yomichan from within Kiwi Browser and mine cards using a special version of Anki Connect but iOS has nothing like that. We have 10ten reader but it doesn't support custom dictionaries, it's extremely clunky to use, and it doesn't support flash card creation. After I complained about this, the developer behind Game2Text was kind enough to develop an app that would solve my problems.\n\nThe app is called \\[Immersion Reader\\]([https://apps.apple.com/jp/app/immersion-reader/id6443721334](https://apps.apple.com/jp/app/immersion-reader/id6443721334)). The main functionality is for mining vocab from ebooks. It is essentially a wrapper for Ttu Reader and works completely offline. You can import Yomichan format dictionaries and lookup words with a single tap and save unknown words to a list which can be exported. The resulting file can be imported from Anki Desktop.  \n\nThere are some other features as well, but they're still in development. There's a section for audio books and read-along content which is targeted at lower level users, and there is also a search function to take advantage of Yomichan format dictionaries.  He also recently added a web browser! The browser is still in development so it's missing a lot of features like saving cookies, bookmarks etc but it is at least useable. Because it's still in the early stages I personally browse via safari and then copy links to open within Immersion Reader. After features like cookies and bookmarks are added I will probably switch to browsing from within the app full time. Ad blocking is being added next though.  Currently the web browser is locked behind a one-time payment, but all of the other features are completely free.\n\nI can't recommend this enough for anyone studying on iOS. As the app is still in development there are a lot of things which are still being added and some features which are not yet fully expanded, but the functionality for reading and mining from ebooks is basically complete and websites are mineable as well. Check it out if you're on iOS and have been looking for something similar.",
