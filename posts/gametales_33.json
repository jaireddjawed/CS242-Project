        "text": "We were playing Halo Mythic, the fan-made Halo RPG\n\nSo, the campaign was \"Operation Nightlight\", a foot-in-the-door recon mission launched by a prowler to Harvest, 72 hours before Admiral Cole's fleet was expected to arrive. I was playing the Smart AI Raziel, staying onboard the ship(which worked with how I couldn't get to the campaign location but appeared through skype calls; I was on the comms.)\n\nAnyway, the Prowler, UNSC Hannover Fist, avoided detection by hiding in the remains of the Tiara, the link between the space elevators from Contact Harvest. It was basically a big cloud of metal debris, plus the cables from the seven elevators, which were still roughly intact and still thousands of miles long. All in all, it was a perfect place to hide the prowler, because even if scans picked up the ship, it would look like one more big chunk of metal among thousands.\n\nSixty hours into the mission, literally everything has gone wrong. The team is being pursued by a high ranking SpecOps Elite, codenamed \"Long Knife\", and he's obviously trying to capture the party; he's called in backup in the form of a Covenant Corvette that's providing overwatch to keep the prowler from Evacing the players, and a Scarab to help chase them down. Internal strife is setting in as one of the players is starting to demonstrate strength that shouldn't have been possible(having successfully wrestled with an Elite) and another has been revealed to be an ONI agent placed to monitor them. The players themselves are getting desperate, and Raziel hears the emergency beacon activated, a signal that it's time to try something, anything, to get them off Harvest.\n\nRaziel signals the team to get as far away from the Scarab and Corvette as possible, and sends a few signals.\n\nA fragment of Raziel is beamed down into the remaining JOTUN systems by maser; the few fragments of the DCS AI Mack are useless at doing anything, but they give Raziel the programs and instructions it needs. A full size JOTUN is maneuvered under the barrel of Harvest's still buried Mass Driver, lifting it up and aiming it carefully. The shell is fired on a ballistic trajectory, and when it lands it strikes the Covenant Corvette, stripping its shields.\n\nMeanwhile, Raziel is busy. The Prowler's emergency thrusters are stripped off by EVA teams, and mounted to the nearest of the seven space elevator cables. I do a quick bit of calculation with some careful estimation, and fire the emergency thrusters.\nThey're powerful enough to deorbit the cable. Thousands of miles of thick, heavy steel cable, falling into Harvest at terminal velocity, punching through the atmosphere and crashing right onto the shieldless Covenant Corvette.\n\nForty two kiloton kinetic yield. The blast annihilates the Corvette and destroys the Scarab and anything else within a few kilometers.\n\nAnd that's how I killed a Covenant spaceship with some steel cable.",

        "text": "The helpful bot will link you to my previous story, but the relevant information is that we are playing an rpg based in the Star Wars universe.\n\nMy Rebellion strike squad had recently taken over an Imperial base on Onderon. Unfortunately for us, the Imperials wanted it back. Our scanners showed something big had just touched down not far from our base. Being a former imperial myself, I was able to identify the scanner signature as an [AT-AT](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/All_Terrain_Armored_Transport/Canon). These things are walking fortresses with high powered laser cannons mounted to the front. \n\nOur Bothan commander started strategizing. We looked at the resources at our disposal. There were 7 of us, against who knows how many in the landing crew. We had a ship, but its weapons might not work well on the armored hull.  We had some mines but they weren't set up yet and even if they were we didn't know if they would dent the walker.\n\nOur group began brainstorming and came up with a plan. Could the Mon Calamari mechanic adjust the mines so that, like a claymore, they fired all of their force in one direction? The GM allowed it, providing she made a hard roll, which she did. \n\n5 of us loaded into the shuttle, while our commander and sniper took off on speeder bikes toward the landing zone.\n\nFrom a concealed position they wait until our shuttle is almost at the AT-AT.  As we approach, they fire off shots intended to distract the pilots of the walker.  Our pilot makes a series of tough rolls, and manages to approach the AT-AT from the rear, in a blind spot its lasers.  She manages to hover over the \"neck\" area of the walker, while the commando in our group places the modified mine at this weak spot. we haul him back up into the cargo bay, and the mechanic remotely detonates the mine. \n\nIt manages to rip a hole into the lightly armored neck. Our commando then drops in a grenade, killing the already stunned knocked down guards inside the corridor.\n\nI drop down my scanner goggles, unsheath my recently acquired vibro sword, and the wookie medic (don't ask) and I jump into the hole. \n\nI slice into the cockpit, where we are met with two very surprised drivers and, surprising to us, a commander sporting a Moff (high ranking government official) uniform. \n\nThe wookie makes short work of one of the drivers with his Ryyk blade. I attack the Moff and manage to get in a hit. The Moff got a shot off at the wookie, who then proceeds to take out other driver.  I score a critical, and in true Star Wars fashion, disarm the Moff quite literally. The arm holding the Moffs blaster now laying on the driver's seat of the AT-AT, the Moff has no weapon and nowhere to run. The wookie knocks him unconscious and we tie him up for questioning. The commando drops down into the ship and we get set take out any resistance in the back of the walker. We open the door, only to be greeted by two imperial pilots. Upon catching a glimpse of the damage we had cause in the cockpit, they surrender. We find that the AT-AT had been modified into a TIE fighter hanger and that they were going to launch once they got closer to the base. \n\nThe session ended there, with the players all talking about how we now have an AT-AT and TIE fighters to fix up and go cruising in.\n\nUnfortunately the next week we were told that Alliance command had commandeered the equipment, but had rewarded us heavily in gear and equipment for our base.  \n\n\n",

Here's the conclusion of yesterday's pathfinder game.\n\nSo the group returns to the crypts after the Druids immaculate  dejining  and we decide to continue on.\n\nWe leave the laboratory and proceed onto a landing. Bear in front, Druid behind him, despite the objections of Garrus that meat shield always goes first, monk and gunslinger in the middle with Garrus the meat shield guarding the back.\n\nDM- as the bear approaches the top of the stairs he is set upon by...a giant spider\n\nGarrus-Nope!\n\nDM- the spider is larger than your brown bear panda jones and now he is looking...\n\nGarrus- NOPE!\n\nDM- to kill him to get to the rest of you.\n\nGarrus then draws a large clay jug of oil from his pack. Garrus has many of these because A: oil is very useful in many way and B: Garrus often considers it completely reasonable to use fire as a means to solve his problems. \n\nGarrus- Garrus wants to fling this oil at the spider\n\nPanda jones- uh...but you might hit my bear too Garrus \n\nGarrus- that's a chance I'm willing to take.\n\nThe gunslinger, unwisely Garrus still believes, threatened to shoot him if he tried to lob the oil so Garrus and his art would have to wait for another day. \n\nThe spider was dispatched by the Druid and his bear who were both poisoned royally in the process, and the group proceeds into the one time dormitories for the one time acolytes of this monastery.\n\nBy this point the Druid has exhausted his cure light wound spells trying to keep himself and the bear alive and requests a rest. The DM (who by the way believes I am besmirching his character mightily by some of your earlier comments on these posts) looks at our actions and decided that enough time had passed between rests for us to rest again. The gunslinger and Garrus, faced with two doorways in the room, decide to barricade the doors with two of the large bed in the room and each take a guard shift while the Druid gets the full eight. \n\nNo sooner do the barricades arise and the Druid gets comfy then the barricades start to rattle and shake. Garrus grabs hold and braces the barricade in question while the slinger and the Druid get into position (the monk takes a position of bait so when the barricade goes down whatever is there will see him first)\n\nMeta gaming we are all freaking out! \"Is it pugwampi's? Flying dicks? Spiders? Oozes? Gnolls? What the fuck is trying to break its way in?\"\n\nSo once everyone is in position Garrus releases the door and prepares to cut the things legs out from underneath it while the Druids readies to do the same. Barricade comes down and in pops...a god damn baboon?\n\nEveryone- a baboon?\n\nDM-- a baboon yes.\n\nSo we spend a few minutes killing jayberries monkeys and the group decides that this is a place to stop for the night. All of us are now completely perplexed by this fucking monastery. Slimes, pugwampis, baboons...this place is a frigging fuck house and we're all just wondering what the next surprise will be.\n\nStay tuned true believers. Chapter 4 will be up in two weeks :)  ",

He sold the rumors that there was some sort of ancient energy source hidden inside a bunker in the Mishpacha jungle with a rough idea of where this bunker was. In exchange, if they found anything there, they can sell the info or source for off the table payment.\nSo to start the session we started with the crew requesting landing at the nearby settlement named Mirthroot Point. As first time visitors, they got free docking. They meet their guide they hired in advance (Nathan Ryker- one of the players) at the docking pad and then set off into the jungle.\n\nThey encountered some feral Nephilim Tribesmen in the jungle but were able to sneak around them (how do you guys handle out-of-combat sneaking). They finally get to the bunker and were able to open the door after hacking the terminal outside of it. The enter inside and the lights are off. Going back to the terminal they see all control comes from the security room just passed the entrance. They turn on the power but they also hear other things passing up. As they enter into the main room on this level, they encounter their first fight. 2 henchmen groups of robots and 3 larger Gorilla-Class nuclear security bots. They have a tough fight, 2 players suffer some injuries to their attributes but they win the fight. Nothing of particular value is found on this floor but they find a stairway into the lower level.\n\nThey see doors to an observation room and a reactor room. They opt to enter the observation room and see several more security bots. They try their hand at the terminals in the room and recognize the controls in here control output on the generator (which is a large glass-encased device with a levitating crystal in floating in the center. It is surrounded with 4 glass encased energy columns on each corner. ) Not wanting another fight with security bots, they plan to rig the reactor to pulse some energy to disable the bots by overloading it but due to a bad roll, they end up frying the crystal too. The crystal was still in one piece but the reactor shut down completely and the orange crystal is completely blackened. With the crystal in tow, the crew of the Ol' Trickle Down are on their way out of the bunker and will be heading back to their ship.\n\nThey do not know if the crystal is still worth anything so some surprises await them.",

        "text": "Before I start, here's the cast of characters:\n\n* Dean Cooper, the human rogue. Has a convincing front as a musician and is typically the party face.\n\n* Vala of Briedlthorpe, tiefling Paladin of Tyr. A knight who stands for justice but has the rage of an inferno.\n\n* T'sa Ormesh, half-orc monk. Calm, collected man of few words.\n\n* Kitara Aristata, half-elf warlock. Raging alcoholic and party-girl noble.\n\nSo our party was making their through the city of Baldur's gate, in pursuit of the cult of the dragon queen. Somehow or another, Dean had convinced the rest of the party to go in disguise. So the group had disguised themselves as best as they could; Dean and T'sa simply wore big fake beards and a change of clothes while Kitara dyed her hair. Changing Vala was no easy task. \n\nVala already had the hassle of being 6'5\", bulky full plate of Tyr and having horns, but she also had incredibly *memorable* horns (her left horn was broken). So her disguise was layers of robes and clothes: hiding her face, horns, *everything*. So while she got some brief questionable looks, most people thought she was a cleric and left it at that.\n\nUnfortunately for her, the disguise didn't last very long due to her short fuse. Somewhere along the line of waiting on the streets for a glimpse of the cult, the group had posed as bards to 'blend in'. Except for Vala. The very idea of posing as a bard, her very vision of all that was sinful and wicked, infuriated her so much that burst into flame and all the robes incinerated around her. As she stormed off to the inn, though, she quickly discovered she was not alone.\n\nAn angry mob had formed, pitchforks and all, and were quite ready to chase her out of town at the least, lynch her at worst. It was something she was used to, unfortunately, which was why she was typically covered head to toe in steel armor. \n\nBefore she, or the mob, could say or do anything brash Dean came sprinting to the scene:\n\n\"Oh THERE you are. Great, now you've gone and spoiled it! We were just preparing for our newest play!\"\n\nDean rolled decently on his persuasion roll. Well enough to actually catch the peoples' interests. He grabbed her horn and began to tug, \"Look at these horns. SO realistic! The skin? Just an illusion! Have you seen a more real looking tiefling?\"\n\nBy that point, T'sa and Kitara had caught up to continue the lie. The townspeople were intrigued at this point. The group continued to insist that it was make-up, and how wonderful this play was going to be. With such amazing special effects, beautiful music, a wonderful plot and fantastic characters, there was no one that could resist this play's charm. The group had a combined effort for success and left the group in amazement, wanting so much to see this godly play. \n\n\"What's it called?\" one villager asked. \n\n\"Uh...\" Dean stammered, then took one look at Vala and declared, \"'The Traveling Tiefling'! Greatest play you'll ever see!\"\n\nThe crowd clamored in excitement and decided to let them go and rehearse, promising they had to be the first to see it. The group recollected, redressed, and continued their act. They caught wind of the cultists and left town promptly in the morning, never putting on the act they hyped up so intensely. \n\nThat was the end of that. Or so they thought.\n\nTurns out they had did such a great job promoting this 'play', that word spread quicker than any wildfire. *Everyone* had to see it. So much so that seeing it made you the coolest kid on the block. Every town the party would go to from that point on would have whispers and boasts of townspeople who have apparently 'seen' this play, and how amazing it was. People would even do favors just to be able to see a glimpse of it. Everyone was in love with the play that didn't exist. \n\nIt had become a bit of a running joke just how popular this non-existant play had become, as well as a bit of a bartering chip. Most townsfolk would be willing to exchange valuables to see it, but the most impressive was at the end of the campaign.\n\nThe party had entered a storm giant's castle, sloshed through cultists and cult leaders and made their way to the storm giant himself. He reflected upon how he wanted to unite the giantfolk with something, but thought that fighting was the only way. Vala, who had grown a bit craftier since the party first banded, replied with a sneer, \"You're intelligent folk. You should all see 'The Traveling Tiefling'!\"\n\nWith a surprisingly good persuade roll on her part, he accepted that as a great idea. It was the best play ever, after all, what better to bond with his kin than such an act of beauty and splendor?\n\nDean turned white and pulled her aside, hissing through clenched teeth: \"*QUIET. I'M NOT DONE WRITING IT YET*\" \n\nThe group formed an alliance with the giants and split their separate ways when the world was saved. I'm not sure if we would have been able to succeed as well if not for the legend of the Greatest Play that Never Existed.\n\n*'The Traveling Tiefling' was written by Dean after the group divided, and was actually preformed at the beginning of the second book of the campaign. It was just a musical version of their adventures with Vala as the titular character, with some 'artistic liberties'. The play lived up to everyones' standards, and Dean now gets royalties now and again.*",

        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3dyd6v/the_glorious_chucklefucks_supercops/",
        "text": "In our most recent session of D&amp;D, [the Glorious Chucklefucks](https://i.imgur.com/rOaUt25.jpg) were tasked by an old friend to investigate the recent theft of a shit ton of gold from the vault of an order of banker monks. This friend was the ruler of a moderately large dwarven kingdom, and he had been falsely accused of ordering the theft; if the true culprit was not found, the monks would go to war to recover their gold. Empowered by the authority of the crown, the Glorious Chucklefucks set out to bring the thieves to justice.\n\nIt went...interestingly.\n\nTheir first lead brings them to a small shop, denoted by a janky makeshift sign as \"Malcolm's 'Solutions'\". One of these \"solutions,\" devices which could displace matter in a large area, had been used to carry out the vault heist. Finding the door locked, Friedrich breaks off the doorknob. Realizing that that is not how doors work, he then proceeds to deal with the actual lock by slicing it (and a large chunk of the door) off with his sword. The group enters the cramped shop, and moments later an irate dwarf emerges from a back room behind the counter and demands to know what has been done to his door. The players all start getting all huffy, some of them thought they should just *pick* the lock, etc etc. \"Did it not occur to any of you to just knock?\"\n\nIt had not once occurred to any of them.\n\nThe supercops then announce their law enforcement status and demand to know who had bought \"solutions\" from him recently, and where to find them. The proprietor obliges, providing descriptions of his customers in recent weeks, of which there have been three. However, every time he says \"solutions,\" he makes a point of doing exaggerated air quotes and emphasizing every syllable. I, of course, am doing this in real life as well, and the players are starting to get really pissed off in game and out of game. So much so, that the moment the shop owner shows a hint of antagonism, Friedrich screams \"resisting arrest\" and knocks him out. Patrick steals all the \"solutions\" and the crew takes the dwarf to jail. He was technically operating an illegal business, after all.\n\nFollowing up the lead on the first customer takes the supercops to the mansion of some rich twat who bought one of the \"solutions\" to clear rubble from his basement. When the lads question him, he is forthcoming and helpful (although the first time he says \"solutions\" I think Wade is about to hit me), but they are nonetheless suspicious of him. Patrick searches the house while Friedrich stays in the basement, irritating the suspect. Trick finds nothing suspicious, although he does break into the man's private vault and inadvertently disable his entire home security system. Deciding that this guy must be hiding something, Friedrich then antagonizes him enough that he assaults the paladin, which is, of course, a crime. Our stellar detective takes him down, arrests him, and then goes off to investigate another lead. \n\nNathaniel had gotten there ahead of him, and is exploring an abandoned building when he finds himself surrounded by goons with crossbows. He has qualms about killing them because they are clearly impoverished and desperate (not poor or desperate enough to not have crossbows, although he didn't consider that angle), but he soon gets over these compunctions and murders the majority of them with a fireball. The survivor is interrogated when the rest of the group arrives, and they use that information along with a series of convenient magical hijinks to appear, invisibly, in the hideout of the thieves they are searching for. There are as many guards as there are supercops, so each of them takes up position behind their target. The party's companion werewolf (or lycanbrope) tears out his guy's throat, and most of the others choke theirs out. Friedrich, meanwhile, decides to chop off his target's sword arm and then blow one of his legs off with his rifle. He then uses Lay on Hands to cure the deadly poison his captive takes, and grabs onto his tongue so that he can't bite it off. Thus immobilized and under the effect of Nathaniel's Geas, he reveals that the stolen treasure is hidden in the basement below them, along with his leader and several more goons.\n\nPatrick decides to take this opportunity to enact \"I Want To Headbutt Him In The Dick Part II: The Reburrowing.\" Just as he did [last time](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/35663k/dd_5e_how_to_cheese_a_dungeon_part_2_i_want_to/), Patrick sneaks between the unsuspecting leader's legs, shifts into weregoat form, and delivers a rocket-propelled headbutt of righteous fury directly into the poor bastard's taint. He's dead, Jim. The rest of the Chucklefucks descend and quickly dispatch the remaining goons, one of whom is intimidated when Trick's screaming goat head bursts out of the dead bastard's throat, and the treasure is reclaimed. War is averted, dubious justice is served, and the Chucklefucks are granted land and titles within the dwarven kingdom for their service. Bizarre? Yes. But this is just business as usual for these Chucklefucks.",

        "text": "Call of Cthulhu, a made-up-as-I-go-along one-shot as a backup for my group's usual Eclipse Phase game.\n\nThe plot involved a mansion, an incompetent cult (Kult of Neptune or \"The Poseidon Adventure Club\"), an extremely creepy murdery cult, and a copy of Cthaat Aquadingen, and maybe a secret plot to call and bind Lake Huron lake creatures (upon finding the book in question and a set of notes describing said creatures, one of my players asked \"is there a lake nearby?\" jfc dude, we're playing in Detroit. We all had a good laugh).\n\nSo anyway, first visit to the mansion found a teenaged member of the Poseidon Adventure Club who'd lost his hat, and subsequent events proved that it was a pretty shitty cult, if it was a cult. But going back, there were robed and shrouded members of a *second* cult making a much bigger mess than they should have been.\n\nThere were only three players, and pretty quickly got the sense that gunfights are probably not a great idea in CoC, so instead of kicking in the door and going in with both barrels hot, they were trying to lure the cultists out or distract them somehow.\n\nSo that's where the horse comes in. There was a stable nearby, full of horses, and this being the 1890s, everyone could handle a horse. They found a hide-a-key, opened the front door, and slapped the horse to get it to charge on in.\n\nMadness. The horse went in all fine at first, but the slap, the slippery marble floor, the unlit foyer, and then the swarm of robed, eyeless, chalky-skinned cultists panicked the beast, and it went fucking nuts, kicking and rearing.\n\nFortunately, the players didn't have to bother with sanity loss, because they had thoughtfully closed and locked the front door behind them, and all the windows had drawn curtains. They think maybe they might have spotted a cultist with a crushed ribcage flying across the room, which they spotted through a tiny slit.\n\nThe distraction worked pretty well, until the cultists finally got the horse under control and led it back outside, obviously interested in finding out who the fuck let a horse inside and killed one of their guys.\n\nThe players were around the other side of the house at this point, and the cult left only two guys around to search for whoever was there, the rest of them searching for the book they wanted. But those two guys, even eyeless, proved eagle-eyed! They spotted one of the player's absurd carriages (he's a carriage maker), painted all over with his name, the name of his business, and the street upon which his carriage shop is located.\n\nEventually spotted by the players, the cultists needed to die, because they didn't want the cult to know where they lived, and thus began a classicly absurd Call of Cthulhu action scene. Our carriage maker flew into a terrified, murderous mania when he saw that these guys were actually eyeless, and the other two couldn't decide whether to help poor Hans or to hide in the woods. They decided to embrace violence, and killed the cultists clumsily, and dragged a gutshot Hans out of the mansion's yard, into the carriage. Luckily (an impale on a luck roll), a friendly urchin they'd hired before was still lurking around, and jumped at the chance of earning a handful of money, and recklessly drove them away from the mansion.\n\nSome awkward Kult of Neptune meetings, a skeptical-turned-sanity-draining attempt at \"charm animal\" spell on a raccoon, and one more firefight later, the shockingly still-living player characters had to explain away five dead or severely wounded eyeless men littering the Detroit streets outside an occult bookstore.\n\nIt went better than expected, it being an entirely made-up one shot.",

My son is teething and I've spent less time asleep than I have in the bathroom so yeah.\n\nSo our Party, Panda Jones the Druid, Ryan the Gunslinger, and Garrus the fighter (Brandon the monk was played by our Druid this time) are moving into the abandoned cathedral of bullshit. The Druid as you will recall was killed last week by flying penises (peni?) but the DM decided that the God who is helping our party made his booboos all better so he got better.\n\nSo today the whole party is on defcon 5. We expected to be killed by pugrappers (pugwampis) or flying dicks (stirges) at any minute so we take appropriate formation (Druid and bear on point, Garrus at the rear, and slinger and monk in between) and begin to explore.\n\nWe find an overgrown garden room (Garrus wanted to burn it I case pugwampis were in there but the party wouldn't let me) and so we moved on to the chapel. The chapel has a statue and several gold plates (which they wouldn't let me steal). The statue turned out to be the entrance to the crypts which Garrus approached VERY cautiously.\n\nNow as a rule I am very mistrusting of crypts, monasteries, graveyards, and any place where shit has a very real chance of going down. As a veterinarian DM I have sprung numerous nasty shit on players in areas like this so when I play a character in always very wary.\n\nThe boneyard was pretty uneventful until we found the laboratory. We enter a laboratory and my character notices a small table of glass vials. Garrus is curious about the vials. Garrus lifts a vial believing it to be acid which he will then throw into the faces of his enemies!\n\nIt was not...\n\nIt was an ooze.\n\nThe ooze erupts on the Druid and Garrus. Gun slinger and the Druid put them down but not before one hit the Druid and gives him a nasty case of fungal rot. So the oozes are dead, xp is given, and adventure is set to continue... or not\n\nThe Druid begins to go cray in a big way. He wants to go back the way we came like NOW. This prickles the hair of the gunslinger and the fighter. He and the DM have been conversing secretly and the gunslinger and I don't like it. He wants to go back to the garden I wanted to burn and he reaches into the tangle like some kind of Arthurian knight and pulls out a god damn great axe.\n\nThe gunslinger prepares to put a bullet in him because we're both convinced he has the shining or some kind of a crypt devil or if nothing else some serious DM fuckery is going on here. The DM informs us that the Druid is now the host of an ancient Genie warrior and the axe he now has is an ancient artifact.\n\nDM: I understand that this is quite strange for mortals such as yourself. I will allow one question from each of you so that you may help to ease your mind.\n\nGarrus: (getting right in his face with the most serious look imaginable) Patrick Swayze ghost or Poltergeist ghost?\n\nDM: what?\n\nGarrus: Are you a Patrick Swayze ghost? Or a poltergeist ghost? Be mindful of your answer or next Garrus uses the axe!\n\nDM:.....Patrick Swayze?\n\nGarrus: right answer.\n\nThe gunslinger snorts: I can't top that one.\n\nThe genie then gave us a long backstory and we agreed that the ghost didn't seem to be hurting the Druid so we continued. As we proceed...\n\nGarrus: wait does this genie have a name\n\nDM playing genie: \"yes I am the powerful and ancient vardenshal!\n\nGarrus: nope, too complicated. We'll call you Robin Williams.\n\nDM: uh...no it's varden...\n\nGarrus: Robin Williams!\n\nAnd thus it was from then on\n\nThis one is going to go on a bit so I'm going to leave it here and break this into two parts. Stay tuned for part 3.5 BURN IT WITH FIRE!   \n\n",

        "text": "So this was my first session of Dnd , let alone pathfinder. My buddy who got me into it has been playing since Dnd first came out. \n\nAnyways, he invited me to play in a game his friend was running. All the people involved had been playing with each other for a few years now, so I felt kinda left out with the inside jokes and what not. Anyways, there's the Cleric, Zorronoastros, Zorro for short, the half elf ranger Dax, the human barbarian named Macenna, Mac for short, Sam, the human rogue, Mazic, the sorcerer, Edith the human ranger, Sim the female half orc barbarian, and me, Will the wizard. We meet in a tavern, yadda yadda, and this halfing woman tosses a bag of coin on our table. She hops up on a stool and says she'll hire us. We follow her through the streets to what we assume is her house. She does a secret knock, and her mother opens the door and invites us in. We are greeted with typical halfling hospitality, I.e food. Like, 10 or 11 food. After the introductions, she tells us why we were hired. The halfling elder of their part of town has comedown with a curse. Real nasty stuff. She tells us we need a toadcabbage blossom, the skin of a banded skink (fuck skinks),and the finger bone of the person who cursed him. She tells us it was Mortimer molefeller, an old historian who laid a curse on a scroll out of spite of everyone else. What a knob flogger, am I right? So, she tells us he's been dead for a few decades, but they know where he's buried. The younger halfling, Slaina (who is being NPC by the DM) is appointed to be our guide. So we say, why wait, let's go now!!\n\nMarshy Grasslands are really shitty.\n\nClouds of flies, hot humid air, tall grass that you can barely see through. We had Edith pass out with heat exhaustion, and the Mazic told the cleric to fill a pot with water, and then put some cloth in it. He did, and the sorc blasted it with a ray of frost, and we put it on the incumbent rangers head. We recovered, and kept moving. The next day, 3 of us fail our fort checks, and come down with huge pustule all over out backs. Dm has us roll-off, lowest number has it really bad. Sorry Sam, but the cleric is gonna have to lance those boils. Much pain later, everyone is fine and dandy. We move into the hills, and on the way up, we realize we are in a skinky area. So we're scrubbing the area and I see one and mage hand that fucker. Thank you cantrips. So we collect it and continue. \nLater on towards nighttime, I spot something on the cliffs and point it out to the rangers. The roll high for knowledge nature, and its fucking troglodytes. The ranger announces it to the party, and Sim starts yelling, make fires (BTW, Sim is the stereotypical hourglass body, super voluptuous, and perfect skin. This is the players visualization of her) so, we start making fires. The other barbarian pits down a ring of torches and lights them. Up on the cliffs, Dax spots the leader, nocks a flaming arrow to his master work compound bow (so fucking expensive, but he got really lucky with his money role I.e 2300 gp) and let's loose. The arrow strikes the rock face and explodes in a shower of flaming oil. I hear something in draconic (also, I have a 20 intelligence so I have 5 languages learned) and its the leader saying \"get them\". After a brief fight, the leader emerges, and is immediately bola'd by Sim. The trogs, seeing their leader go down, rout, and leave it out to dry. We go up and fuck up his shit while he's down. \n\nI'm gonna end this here, next part coming when I get around to it. (Sorry if its boring, it picks up pace later) ",

        "text": "I pull up a chair in front of the Adept and place myself down.  He looks pale; afraid.  Really there is no surprise there considering the events that just transpired.\n\nI clear my throat.  \"Your name.\" I command.\n\n\"M-my Lord - sir - I... there was just a mistake!\" The Adept Stammers.\n\nI blankly stare.  \"I asked for your name.\"  \n\nHe takes a deep breath.  \" Phelio, sir.\"\n\nI lean back resting my arm over the chair.  \"Do you know why you are here?\"  He fails to meet my gaze, face stained with guilt, lips quivering as he speaks.\n\n\"I...\"\n\t\nWe go back and forth; all the while he tries to hide behind feeble excuses.  The Barron brings the log book over that Phelio was caught scribbling notes from.  Upon observation it appears that the pages bookmarked all have a common factor; they are extracts depicting transactions the late Lord Winter's made with Xenos.  Perfectly legal actions of course for one of his stature.\n\n\"Interested in Xenos are we?\"  I turn back to my quarry after carefully taking in what I could.  He noticeably shudders, triggering his nonsensical babbling anew.  I grow tired of this - I slam the book shut to silence him.  \"Why don't we stop these games, hm?  You were making notes under orders from the Inquisition, weren't you?\"\n\nHe shakes his head, but his face gives him away.  I lean forward into a more imposing stance, closing the gap between us.\n\n\"If you keep quiet I will have no further use for you.  Now - *tell* me what you know.\"  A moment's pause, then a pitiful set of eyes struggles to meet mine.\n\nHis voice is but a whisper.  \"If I tell you, I wish to be protected from... Lord Winters.\"  I feel the urge to roll my eyes at such a weak-willed response surge through me, but I must resist.  This is what passes for an Acolyte these days?\n\nHow pathetic.  \"Fine.\" I sigh.  \"I'll give you my word; my Lord will not harm you.\"\n\nHe swiftly tells me everything; that the Inquisition are here hunting a witch cult - the Sons of Tarm - who were reported as stowaways aboard our vessel.  Perhaps this is true.  The man who attacked my Lord did possess... 'unnatural' abilities.  I already know Fell associates with witches all too well.  There would be no reason why he wouldn't use them to his advantage.  I would in his position.\n\n\"Our ship has always been clean,\" the Barron contests, \"we have never had such an infection before.\"\n\nI take to my feet, propping the chair to the side.  \"Pray tell, who relayed this apparent infestation?\"\n\n\"Lord Trader, Hadarack Fell.\"  I suppose I should have seen this coming.  It seems our enemy is craftier than I thought.  How disheartening.\n\n\"You see, don't you?\" I look between the Barron and the squirming Adept.  \"We are chasing after the same prize as Fell, and he just so happens to mention a cult aboard our ship?  You really feel this is a coincidence?\"  There is no doubt in my mind that this 'cult' is apart of Fell's crew.\n\nThe Acolyte shrugs.  \"Lord Fell has been a friend to the Inquisition; my Inquisitor himself speaks very highly.  He has reported many cases that have been brought to justice.\"\n\nI raise an eyebrow. \"Fell is close to your Inquisitor?\"\n\nPhelio explains how Fell and his superior, Inquisitor Aeskepolis, came to meet.  It turns out Fell saved the Inquisitor's life during an Eldar ambush.  Since that day they have travelled similar paths; always close by.  With that, all the pieces begin to fall into place.\n\nHadarack Fell.  On one hand, he holds enough command over a witch cult to use them as spies and assassins.  The other, a sect of the Inquisition at his beck and call.  He sends both to ensure his enemies are removed, caught in the middle of his pawns' infighting as he swoops in and collects the spoils and riches.\n\nHonestly, it's remarkable.  I can't help but be impressed; what connections to have.  Still, he hasn't battled wits against one like me before.\n\nI finish gathering all the details I need, learning their process.  The spineless Adept is unsure of precisely how many Acolytes there are.  They are sent in closed cells to different locations.  He only worked with two others, the Psyker whom my Lord has already attended to, and another working under our Explorator by the name of 'Tanlon'.\n\n\"Your remaining partner,\" I ask, \"have you been able to tell him about the... misunderstanding with my Lord?\"\n\nSlowly, he shakes his head.  \"No sir.\"\n\nGood.\n\nI look to the Barron who is now stood behind Phelio.  He makes a gesture to his gun on his hip, his eyes scanning my expression for an answer.  I raise my hand slightly, signalling him to stand down, before turning back to the prisoner and speak.\n\n\"I will stay true to my word.  My Lord will not harm you for all that you have said.\"  Relief visually washes over him as his shoulders relax.  He thanks me but I cut him short.  \"However...\"  I take my Inferno Pistol out once more, pointing it directly between his eyes.\n\n\"You should have begged for mercy from *me* instead.\"\n\nHe tries to react but I'm faster.  I fire as the Barron carefully shifts out the way, the Adept of the Inquisition erupting into flame as the shot connects.  In an instant the entire mess explodes, melting his flesh and disintegrating everything else, leaving nothing but half a chair and a ring of ashen carpet.\n\nAt this rate I'll need to buy more ammunition sooner than expected.\n\n\"Masterfully done sir.\"  The Barron returns to my side, putting out the rest of the fire.\n\n\"Thank you.\"  I step back, checking over my weapon before putting it back in its place.  \"I'll make sure to pay for the repairs to your quarters.\"\n\n\"That's kind of you sir.\"  I wave off his response and tentatively touch the right corner of my glasses with my finger, a habit which allows me to concentrate.  \"What is our next move sir?\"  A good question.  There are many things to attend to, but not much time until we reach our destination.  Thanks to the skill of our Navigator we are over a week ahead of schedule.  Not everything can be prepared in time.  I'll have to prioritise.\n\n\"I'm not sure yet, but I will be back with you as soon as I've organised my thoughts.  Until then, have your men look into other potential operatives.\"\n\n\"As you wish sir.\"  He nods his head as I exit his quarters, heading to my own.\n\nNow, where to start?\n\n[Start](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3dfr45/tales_from_a_seneschal_rogue_trader/) | [Previous](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3dfr45/tales_from_a_seneschal_rogue_trader/) | [Next](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3el7xa/tales_from_a_seneschal_part_3_rogue_trader/) | [Last](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3i4hxx/rogue_trader_tales_from_a_seneschal_part_6/)",

I effectively gave her three free questions to a pretty much all powerful goddess and here is what she asked:\n\n\n\"What did my father do to rya (her lover) to make him so angry?\"\n\n\n\"Should I expect to see you (the goddess) in waking life?\"\n\n\"Will we be alright?!\" (she asked this because the connection of the dream would break. This counted as a question but the goddess rolled enough to keep the dream going for jsut one more question.\n\n\"Will I meet my father again?\" \n\n\nGranted the last question was pretty good. She found out parts of her destiny. The real problem was that the only 2 questions the goddess could not answer, those about her in the real world and those about rya, were basically one of the like tiny itty bitty few she couldn't answer for her. Seriously wasted questions. Titania the bard did however find out that she will probably meet her father once more.

        "text": "EDIT: Fifth Edition Dungeons &amp; Dragons. Forgot to include the name of the game at the start of my post. Oops. :|\n\nThis post can also be read on my freshly minted [blog](http://ichargethedoor.com/that-time-my-warlock-polymorphed-into-an-eldritch-wolf-ape-and-sky-punched-a-young-red-dragon/). Enjoy :)\n\n---\n\nAfter DMing a nine-month campaign that spanned both Hoard of the Dragon Queen and Rise of Tiamat, I returned to a weekly D&amp;D table as a player on July 1st, 2015.\n\nBut I did not come empty-handed, low-level, and powerless. Nay, I returned to the table with two gems of great price: 9,000 Dungeon Master experience points gained from running my previous campaign, and a [HeroForge](http://www.heroforge.com) mini, [painted by my Dungeon ~~Mistress?~~ Master, Sam](http://i.imgur.com/Bl9G7ha.jpg). The experience brought my wolf-themed Wood Elf Warlock, Moon Moon, to Level 7. The miniature made him look like a stupendous badass.\n\nSince I am friends with my DM, she gave me a small preview of the night's session, as well as general information on the Party and how they operated. Because Sam is a kind and merciful DM, she informed me that the night's combat would have a BBEG. Once I knew this, my path was set.\n\nI wanted to return as a player in a big way. I wanted to make a splash. I wanted Moon Moon to do something hilariously awesome that would ingratiate him with his new ~~party~~ pack. And upon reaching level 7, a Warlock can choose a new invocation, such as ***[Sculptor of Flesh](http://i.imgur.com/JKmWLXA.jpg)***.\n\nAfter the game began, I waited patiently for ninety minutes before I made my move. I waited while the obligatory bit of exposition happened at the beginning of the session. I waited while an impetus to engage the plot was laid upon the shoulders of a Half-Elf Ranged Fighter, Hamelon. I waited while the party tracked dragon cultists through the forest. I waited while the party happened upon a group of Red Half-Dragon fighters guarding a group of refugees. I waited for several rounds after combat started, expending one of two Warlock spell slots to fly to the top of a tree. \n\nAt this point in the game, Moon Moon had not yet revealed himself to the other adventurers. \n\nMoon Moon wolf. Moon Moon wait in shadow. Quiet. Patient. \n\nThen the session's BBEG appeared: a Young Red Dragon. \n\nThen Moon Moon wait no more. \n\nFrom the top of the tree, Moon Moon shot up into the cool night air. Hamelon's player asked if Moon Moon had solved the [icing problem](https://youtu.be/eT-P_N-fihs?t=2m49s). I responded \"Moon Moon run hot,\" and that if ice did form on his [perfectly painted abdominals](http://i.imgur.com/YieCiqB.jpg), he would merely flex, and it would explode.\n\nOn subsequent turns Moon Moon flew to an altitude of three hundred feet, while remaining undetected. Neither friend nor foe knew of Moon Moon's presence. \n\nAt this point the flow of combat was interrupted while I asked Sam how many feet Moon Moon would fall in a round should he stop flying. I thought having a physicist at the table would make answering this question easier. Spoilers: it didn't.\n\nShe eventually ruled that I would have time to take a single Action prior to impact. Success! I maneuvered Moon Moon directly above the Young Red Dragon and cast polymorph.\n\nI then informed the table that a **HUGE** creature was now falling from the sky. If they were to look up they would see two enormous eyes, streaming blue-green eldritch fire falling towards them. Combat continued for a round as a polymorphed Moon Moon fell. Then, my moment came. \n\nSam informed me that Moon Moon might be taking as much as 20d6 falling damage. I told her that I was okay with taking a lot of damage, as long as the dragon underneath me took a significant portion, too. \n\n**Cleric:** \"I prepare to cast Death Ward on you.\"\n\n**Me:** \"Prepare to cast Death Ward on the mother-fucking *dragon*.\"\n\nThe Half-Orc Paladin, Oloch, decided to meta-game himself away from the dragon after finishing his attacks, casting **Smoke Bomb!** (Misty Step) as a Bonus Action, retro-actively Nat. 20ing a Perception check to duck the charge of meta-gaming leveled at him by Sam. \n\nMoments prior to impact I informed the party *exactly* what Moon Moon had become:\n\n\"You see a huge creature out of Lovecraftian horror, with the body of an ape, the head of a wolf, blue-green eldritch fire streaming from its eyes. And tentacles coming out of its back.\" (1)\n\nI then abused the Warlock's Awakened Mind mechanic (2) so I could announce myself properly, telepathically communicating with the Party as well as the Young Red Dragon:\n\n**[I. Am. Moon Moon!](http://i.imgur.com/WdI45dX.jpg)**\n\nAnd then, I struck. Punching downward into the dragon's back, 20d6 worth of kinetic energy plus my punch. All told, the 20d6's were worth 70 points of damage, which was divided between the Eldritch Wolf-Ape (aka Moon Moon) and the Young Red Dragon. Sam informed me there was now a very red and squishy crater where the dragon used to be. \n\nThe irony is that I made the Concentration check required for Polymorph from the falling damage, but a low-damage attack by a fellow party member (confused by Moon Moon's appearance) disrupted it. Dammit Zook!\n\nOn my next turn, Moon Moon stood up, gazed upon what he had wrought and said: \"Yeah, Moon Moon badass.\"\n\n---\n\n1. I polymorphed into the Giant Ape on page 323 of the Monster Manual. The tentacles and wolf-head are flavor, as Moon Moon worships an eldritch Cthulian wolf-god called the **Great Wise Wolf Spirit**.\n\n2. Awakened mind only has  a range of 30 feet, and it's unclear whether or not it is usable while polymorphed. Rule of cool was in effect. ",

        "text": "Mission Debrief\nDrauk 437 Irregulars\nDate M41.32.09.132\n\n(Acting) Seargent Daylan Fervor reporting\n\n“The Hand of the Emperor guides us in all things, he directs our minds and bodies towards betterment of all mankind in His image.” -Catechisms of the Faithful p223\n\nAssessment of Mission\nOur mission parameters were to find and eliminate the enemy general, known as “Skarrus” on the traitorously held planet Vibrus. The team assembled was the abhuman regiment that is unusual for the Drauk. It consisted of the following soldiers: Seargant Jaimie, Daylan and Jarr Fervor, Locker Colt (Ratling), Lenny (Ogryn), and Katiana and Richard Nublar, all dedicated to the destruction of the Emperor’s enemies. In the course of preparing for the mission we requisitioned supplies from the Drauk quartermaster stationed on The Emperor Dominus III. Due to a shortage of manpower in the armory some of the items required for completion of the mission were unavailable. In the chaos of a Guard deployment this is unavoidable however in the future higher priority on goods acquisition may enable the Irregulars to complete our task with alacrity.\n\n“His right arm is the Hammer but We are the Anvil! His foes will be crushed upon us as we stand true.” -Catechisms of the Faithful p1\n\nWe loaded up with our platoon to a troop transport. Spirits were high as we made the bumpy trip onto the planet from orbit. The troops joking about how many heretics they were going to kill. Command walking up and down the aisles preaching the wrath of the Emperor. The trip got worse as we entered the hot-zone to the point where our vessel was ripped to shreds by anti-aircraft fire. We lost many good soldiers in the crash, and most of command. Fortuitously however the Irregulars were in one piece and mobilized, taking command of the situation and issuing orders to the survivors. We secured the equipment we would need to feed and arm the remains of the platoon and were actually grateful to discover that the missile launchers we had requisitioned were replaced with a crate of Imperial Guard Primers. Using the inspirational words of the Imperium we rallied the troops and evacuated the transport.\n\n“Beware the folly of Man.” -Catechisms of the Faithful p199\n\nThe plan was to establish a hard point around the remains of the dropship and secure it as a base for the wounded to defend. Unfortunately the enemy was already on the move towards the crash site. Outnumbered and outgunned the Irregulars and the troops following us made a fighting retreat for cover. The enemy scorched the remains of the dropship and slew all remaining injured. Three brave warriors lost their lives to the heretics so we might make our escape. We pray their souls find their way to the Emperor.\n\n“It is better to die charging for the Emperor than to live squirming in the filth of cowardice.” -Imperial Guard Primer\n\nWith sufficient supplies to last us some time and angered at the deaths of our comrades we set our sights on completion of our mission. General Skarrus would find his end at the points of our bayonets. We moved north. Along the way we encountered a feral outpost, poorly defended. The ferals of this world seem to be normally nomadic, moving about in great hordes with the vehicles produced by their foundries. May we secure them and cleanse them of the corruption of the enemy to turn the technology to the good of the Imperium. After encountering a patrol in the night and eliminating them we were forced to take the outpost by storm. It was fortunate that we did, for we secured information here that would lead us to our best chance at General Skarrus.\n\n“Providence is the hand of the Emperor. He gives to the loyal, and takes everything from those who turn from him.” -Catechisms of the Faithful, p176\n\nLogs by the leader of the Feral outpost pointed us towards an ambush that had been conducted against a Janissary Kill-Team. We discovered the remains of their chimera and oddly carved up bodies. Sergeant Jamie managed to access a dataslate that provided us with yet more insight to the enemy’s movements. It was highly likely that General Skarrus had taken to holing up in a local holy place known as The Mount. Further, we learned that they received regular supply drops via surface vehicle. We managed to salvage the chimera and its heavy bolter.\n\n“Fall upon your foes like lightning, strike them from the land and salt the earth that they may never return!” -Imperial Guard Primer\n\nWith a vehicle we made good time towards The Mount. Along the way we discovered the perfect opportunity. An ambush site that would be a veritable kill zone for our enemies. We set up there and waited. The enemy supply train actually consisted of a sentinel, a truck with the supplies, and a chimera full of enemy soldiers. We made short work of them. Lenny’s help was instrumental. In a display of incredible strength and finesse he lept upon the supply truck and ripped the driver in twain. This flushed out the enemy Sergeant, a stormtrooper equipped with a power sword. I’m sorry to say the enemy killed Richard, a valuable member of our team. He and his wife will be missed.\n\n“Those who die in the Emperor’s name will be honored for all time.” -Moratat Fazeus, during the christening ceremony for the Drauk 437th.\n\nOne of the enemy surrendered. A squad leader at best, though he had some small amount of information that we were able to use. We knew anything else out of his mouth would be heresy at best so we sent his soul to be judged by the Emperor. We loaded up the truck and headed in to the Mount, intending to lie our way in and assassinate the General. On the way in we discovered a Commissar. Trego was far from Imperial lines but critical to our mission. With his help, his commanding presence and sharp intellect we managed to lie our way past the gates guarding The Mount and into the compound.\n\n“The strongholds of the Enemy are boils upon the land of the Imperium. Lance them, and scrape their pus and blood from the wound.” -Medicae Sara, Janissary\n\nThe fortune of the Emperor smiled upon us again as we entered the compound on a mountain of lies. A portion of the hillside had been carved out to create an enclosed supply dump run by a disgusting mutant. We slew him with impunity. We discovered a passage from the supply dump deeper into the mountain and suspecting it would lead towards Skarrus followed it. What we found instead was a foul xenos hive. The Mount housed aliens that looked like man but were unnatural in detail. They moved almost too fast for the eye to see. We discovered one engrossed in torturing a truly strong guardsman to the name of Regal, a loyal Janissary. With the weight of our fire we slew the xenos witch and continued into the Mount. We discovered a hangar for the creatures where they were preparing to launch a strike upon the Imperial lines. Knowing our time to complete our mission was short we hurried back towards the enemy stronghold.\n\n“Never treat with the Xenos, for their kind crave only the end of mankind.” -Imperial Primer p347\n\nA den of mutants was all that stood between us and what was clearly the only bastion that General Skarrus might be hiding inside. We couldn’t let the foul creatures live though as they also had Guardsmen they were feasting upon and our assault on the heretical filth alerted the enemy to our presence. We faced off against heavy enemy fire. A squad of Guardsmen, Stormtroopers, and a horde of mutants made their presence known. General Skarrus himself arrived to direct the battle, shouting from the rooftop. It looked grim. We were heavily pinned and hurting after a charge by the mutants. Somehow, Sarge had made it onto the rooftop to take on Skarrus single handed. The power sword he had taken from the enemy before was in his hands and he smote Skarrus with weapons he himself had rightfully stolen from the Imperium. Unfortunately it was not enough. Skarrus nearly struck down Jamie. I was at a thread of consciousness myself, fighting off the flailing limbs of horrid creatures that were once human when I saw it.\n\nTruly the Emperor must have moved through Sergeant Jamie to have him pull his grenades and leap with Skarrus over the edge of the roof. Their lives were ended in a single momentous flash but the single moment of unparalleled bravery completed our mission. Truly Sergeant Jamie should be remembered as a Champion of the Emperor, to sit at his right side forever in glory and honor. The mutants broke. The heretical guardsmen retreated. We gunned down as many as we could when their faith in a false god was crushed.\n\n“Look to yourself and see that all you truly have is faith in the Emperor.” -Catechisms of the Faithful p1\n\nIt was at this time that a xenos vessel descended upon us. This was their territory as I realized, for I recalled much in the way of ancient xenos artefacts about the Mount. As acting Sergeant I called a full retreat, racing through the now empty tunnels of the mount back to our vehicles. I dropped radio silence to contact command via vox and announce the completion of our mission. We were rewarded with an extraction point and a countdown to get their. Relying fully on the command skills of Commissar Trego we drove with fury into the countryside. The xenos followed us.\n\n“Fear not the xenos, for they do not have the love of the Emperor to guide them.” - Catechisms of the Faithful, written in the margin\n\nLenny once again did the Emperor’s work, gunning down the largest enemy vessel with the autocannon he had taken from the late Richard Nublar. We raced to the extraction point, eliminating the xenos scum as we could. In the end we still had to face off against them in one on one combat when we reached the extraction point. One of the warped bitches nearly killed me and my brother with some kind of alien whip but with the fury of the Imperium Commissar Trego and Lenny cut the xenos to ribbons before she could strike the final blow.\n\nWe mourn our many losses and celebrate the end of the heretical General Skarrus. May his soul rot forever.\n\nIn the name of the Imperium,\nDaylan Fervor.",

        "author": "kyraeus",
        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3dh3c9/pathfinder_the_power_of_kobolds/",
        "text": "First time poster here, was looking for a good place to share some collected stories from our weekly Pathfinder game.   Keep in mind, if you ever read Paul Kidd's novel 'Fey', Snick-Snack is loosely (very) based on the character of the same name.  Right down to his battle-cry of 'CHIHUAHUA!', which will live in infamy at our table for years to come, if I have anything to do with it.\n\nTo start off with, our GM has us in a custom world, Deyra.  For all game term intents and purposes except politics/etc., analogous to Golarion (Pathfinder default world).  The group is pretty chill, though we have some powerplayers (including myself, being the oldest of the group at 35).  We do like us some shenanigans at times.  These are the tales of some of the best of mine.  They're adapted from facebook postings of the original notes, so be kind. =^.^=\n\nApparently kobolds as a race just WORK for me. They have that perfect mix of determination, and sheer hilarity that just blows minds.  There's something about playing a race wherein you EXPECT some stupidity and ridiculousness that appeals to the best in me.  I decided to play one as we were entering a Pathfinder future tech campaign, and after the first couple sessions, our GM and most of the players exclaimed (as I was new at the time to the group), that said character, although being a kobold, HAD to be related to the GM's previous character in that world, Kavak, Goblin alchemist, and resident insane pyromaniac.\n\n\nI) Snick-Snack's start.\n\n\nSo I decided to create a kobold technologist.  Based lightly on author Paul Kidd's character 'Snick-Snack' from the novel 'Fey' (great read BTW), he plays something like a Jim Henson's Muppet on crack, and managed in the space of a few hours to not only crack up my party repeatedly, but...\n\n1) Tossed an emergency life raft (a la airplane raft) at a couple enemies, immediately after hitting the button to inflate it.. Thereby incurring a sequence of two very surprised and confused soldiers who had not, in fact, seen said kobold, knocked to the ground and stuck under an inflatable raft.\n\n2) Plastering the OTHER two soldiers in a coating of foam from a handheld fire extinguisher after popping comedically out of a snowbank, effectively blinding them.\n\n3) Literally chasing said two soldiers at a run, coated in foam, the two of them both terrified, having NEVER FUCKING SEEN WHAT DID ANY OF THIS TO THEM. (Picture two 5-6 foot humans in full gear with guns running in terror from a 2 and a half foot walking muppet, that is known as one of the single weakest, most cowardly races in all of Pathfinder.. Yeah.)\n\n\nII) Kobold Hijinks\n\n\nIn addition to creating a masterwork Parachute Poncho out of his chute (thus rendering him able to semi-fly), Snicky-snack managed to basically get a super-rare roll on the loot table (literally 100) for a scientist the party took out, and ended up with a small cube of electromagnetically held antimatter. For those not in the know, basically it means there's a kobold, of all things, sitting on a substance that could easily become a bomb the likes of Hiroshima or worse.\n\nWhich he almost immediately used to threaten two soldiers in powered armor (notably several levels higher than himself), causing them to effectively pee themselves and drop their railguns... all while the party's collective backs were basically turned in another room. Which, I might add, he ended up giving to the party and they have begun using said weapons to decimate the base. (Railguns literally fire THROUGH walls, and there HAS already been talk of simply firing down through the base's underground levels to go directly to the bottom).\n\nThere's something hilarious about the idea of a kobold, particularly one based on the specific literature Snick Snack is, terrifying the living hell out of basically everything he meets. I love this little guy.\n\nFor anyone confused, picture something comical and adorable suddenly pointing a gun at you and growling like a feral beast.  Given, he'd never have done it... but they didn't know that ;p\n\nPostscript:  Apparently our GM decided that the antimatter and railguns were a bit OP. I've literally never had a GM pull a 'Matrix' on me before. (A la, we got hurt, made a will check, and woke up in vats of goop in another room without all the crap we'd accumulated since entering the base).   I'm sad now. :(\n\n\nIII) Time to shine\n\nSnick-Snack apparently did his doctoral thesis in Unusual Weaponry 101 on the many uses of an emergency liferaft. He's surprised, bludgeoned, and buried enemies with it.\n\nThis time, he literally choked someone mostly to death with it.\nTo set the scene, coming up on an area filled with cameras, the party was debating how to pass by silently without being noticed. They'd just taken out a guard at the front desk of the area (lying out cold), and were proceeding to sneak past the cameras. This... just plain wasn't good enough for a kobold.\n\nSnick-Snack grabs the downed guard, proceeds to coup-de-gras him to death with a knife, then uses a stun gun to create a 'smoking crater' effect on the body, stuffs a busted multitool in the guard's lifeless hand, and after having the party's android companion shoot out one of the cameras, proceeds to strategically place the body as though the guard was working on the camera and fried himself.\n\nLater on, the inevitable guards show up, everyone's hidden, Snick-Snack 'Sam Fisher's his way up behind the guard, only to drop like a silent shadow, SLAMMING the damned liferaft in a small crack between said guard's body and his armor, and hit the inflation button, turning the guard a decidedly purple color, and plumping his armor out, though not completely blowing it off, which incidentally hits and sends the kobold tumbling head over heels into the nearest wall.\n\nFinal postscript to Snick-Snack, Technologist Extraordinaire:  For his shenanigans, the GM saw fit to award Snick-Snack five full levels (yes, we power play a bit, because campaigns get boring otherwise).  Because he already had the traits to back it up, Leadership (the feat) was gained, and immediately he gained an entourage of hooting kobold followers, including a blushing cute 6th level female kobold Chirurgeon (alchemist alternate type) who's... interested, shall we say?  \n\n\nIV) The family line in arrears\n\nThis session, I played the great, great, great, great, etc... grandpappy of my previous kobold, Snick-Snack, today because the group was having some issues with pet classes on current characters and we wanted to pare it down a bit.\n\nClick-Clack, kobold alchemist and grandson through marriage to one of the 'legendary' NPC characters in the campaign (the aforementioned goblin Kavak), saw his time to shine tonight and totally took it. An NPC 19+level wizard also of epic power, dumped a shitfuckton of what looked like sand out in front of us while we were stuck in a pocket dimension of a bag of holding, the entrance to said bag blocked by miles of rock after a rockfall, which forced us into the bag in the first place, but for a small space, just big enough to sit in.\n\nUpon closer inspection, the 'sand', was actually tiny preshrunk and basically freeze-dried creatures. And they were preparing to grow. Click-Clack saw his opportunity, and he seized it. Scooping up all the 'sand', he dumps the bag full of it outside the bag of holding dimension, and before closing the flap, dumps in a potion of 'enlarge creature'.\n\nNote: the creatures in question were ALL gigantic size.. Creatures don't respond well to enlarging to colossal size after being freeze dried, while under miles of rock. In fact, they respond with a gigantic 'squish', and create both a humongous several mile tall rocksplosion from under the ocean, and a completely new island entirely composed of rotting monster corpses and golem parts, which is now a new area for exploration.\n\n\nWell... that is, AFTER the characters all immediately level to 20 for having just killed several MILLION xp worth of colossal creatures.",

        "text": "I follow my Lord Rogue trader, because his success is mine.\n\nIt is my job to overlook the ship - to balance the books, to know where there is money to be made and where there is not.  I look out for traitors or threats; any matter that requires my attention. Attending to these issues leaves my Lord free to focus on his vision for the future, while I pave the way to make it a reality.\n\n“Right.” My Lord mutters as he looks over the charred mess that was once a person sitting in a chair. “Kaleb,” he turns to me, “you’ll think of a cover story for this in case people start asking questions.”\n\n“Of course sir.”  I replace the now-cooled Inferno pistol back under my coat.  “I will see to it.”\n\nHe strides over to his seat, straightening himself out from the previous altercation and takes his glass of wine, sighing.  “I won’t have the Inquisition on my ship.”  The select few other members of staff calm themselves and go back to their duties. I look from the ashes of the assailant to the empty chair at the end of the meeting table, where an Imperial Psyker sat moments before my Lord flushed him into the vacuum of space.  The events here are troubling, but now lacking a body to question I must find my information elsewhere.\n\n“I’ll look into this threat.”  I bow, and take my leave.  We have one of experience who aids me; an old Seneschal of a previous Rogue Trading family. He is our Spy Master, as I am kept quite busy by my Lord and find it difficult to manage these things on my own. Speaking to him I try and seek a suspect to question, away from my Lord’s itchy trigger finger.\n\n“What has happened?” the Spy Master, a figure we address only by the Barron, asks.\n\n“As you know,” I begin, “we are on the hunt for a great treasure, a ship of legend: \"The Righteous Path\".  Our rival Trader – Hadarack Fell – had sent spies aboard our ship, so our dear Navigator -” a young woman named Odette, “– thought it would be a splendid idea to dabble in my work and gather a group of “witch” hunters, since I mistakenly mentioned to her that they were sending out messages via Astropaths hidden in the lower decks.”\n\nHis face looks pained by my words but, I continue.\n\n“She found two suspicious individuals and brought them before the Rogue Trader and myself. One of them attacked our Lord, and so, had to be put down.  The second begged for mercy, revealing that he was a Psyker for the Inquisition.  Protecting the interests of the ship and crew, our Lord behaved somewhat rashly and plunged him to his death quite immediately, so I was not able to ask exactly what he was doing here.”\n\nThis is the situation that I am to, in my Lord’s words, *think of a cover story* for.\n\n\"How curious you've also found out.\"  I look at the Barron, urging him to go on.  \"My informants have just reported back.  They found one of the Adepts copying notes from an old captain's log.  Particularly old in fact; from when Lord Winters' father was Rogue Trader.\"  My Lord inherited his title after a fierce battle almost wiped out the entire Winters family fleet.  Only our ship along with my Lord survived the attack.  That was a few years ago now.\n\n\"Why would he be doing that?\"\n\n\"I don't know sir, perhaps to find a reason for the Inquisition to investigate us openly.\"  Again I muse on his words, adjusting my glasses with my index finger.  How many of them have managed to hide aboard?  \"He is the scribe who takes the minutes at your meetings.\"\n\nSnapping out of my train of thought I look at him.  \"He observes our meetings?\"  Such as the meeting that resulted in the expulsion of an Imperial Psyker...\n\nThe Barron catches my reaction.  \"I'll send for him now.\"\n\nI nod and wait.  Sure enough, a man I recognize from only minutes before is led through by guards.  He is forced to sit before me; the Barron stepping aside giving me the floor to speak.\n\nThis is going to take some time.\n\nStart | Previous | [Next](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3dr42a/tales_from_a_seneschal_part_2_rogue_trader/) | [Last](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3i4hxx/rogue_trader_tales_from_a_seneschal_part_6/)",

        "text": "It's the beginning of a new campaign and we all meet in a tavern (of course). Having been summoned by letters written on dragon scales. The team consists of a Pixie Bard (my character, Lilli), a human rouge (Verrick), a human cleric of Pelor (Aldain), and two other, not so important people.\n\nDM sets us off, and after an encounter we arrive at our location. The scales told us to \"Raise our right hand near the thing that grows the more you take from it.\" It takes most of the party a second to catch on, I immediately start looking for a hole. My search leads me to a small rock, too big for my Pixie to move, however, so I call Verrick over to move it.\n\nSure enough there is a hole under it, and after raising my hand I am gone. No one else notices and it still takes about 5 minutes for them to figure it out.\n\nThe DM makes a hidden roll.\n\nFast forward to the afternoon we are all back at the tavern, drinking it up, Verrick hugging his pet rock. Aldain has an idea for a party trick and asks Verrick if he can borrow the rock. He agrees, but then the DM speaks up. \n\n\"You almost hand Aldain the rock but suddenly you don't feel like you can trust him with it.\"\n\nThis, of course, get's everyone's attention. After many attempts to get Verrick to part with the rock, our Cleric makes an arcana check to see what the deal is. We find out it is cursed, but the roll was too low to find out what type of curse. It's off to the library for research. \n\nAs the party goes off to figure out what this curse is, Lili decides to go shopping.\n\nA short while later the curse is identified as an attraction curse, the cursed cannot part with the cursed item, due to mistrust of those around him. It's a minor curse, worst it does is take up space in the inventory. But I take it upon myself to help my friends! Lili reaches into her pouch and pulls out a bottle, enlarging it and handing it to Verrick.\n\n\"Figured your rock could use a little polish.\" She says to him. But he is still wary, so he puts a small drop and rubs it in. And, according to the DM, it makes the spot shinier.\n\nThat is when he dumps the whole bottle on it. Did I mention Lili is a trickster?\n\n\"The Alchemical Acid quickly eats away the rock and it crumbles in your fingers.\" the DM said. \"You are now blinded by rage, roll a D20.\"\n\nVerrick gets a 17. Enough to overcome Lili's AC. With one swift punch, the pixie flies across the room into a bookshelf, knocking it over on her.\n\nVerrick storms across the room to find her but is stopped by the rest of the party. Aldain makes an emergency roll for Light of Pelor.\n\nCritical HIt.\n\n\"IN THE NAME OF PELOR I COMMAND THAT YE BE CLEANSED OF ALL WICKEDNESS\" He shouts, and light shines down from the heavens, striking Verrick and sending shadows fleeing from him.",

        "text": "Playing Edge of the Empire, a Star Wars RPG with a Serenity feel to it.  The settings is post Battle of Yavin.  This is the first session.  \n\nThe players are all in a cell together on the prison barge _Purge_ (tee-hee).  Rebels attack and free some political prisoners.  The players escape their cell after being let out, as one of the players is a Wookie Rebel sympathizer.  The Rebels cleared most of the way for escape, so long story short, the players steal the launch codes for a Lambda-T4a shuttle.  \n\nWhen the session first started, something called Obligation triggered for one of the players.  Obligation is a sort of pressure mechanic that sort of functions as a renown/infamy factor that affects what the players can do, and also can trigger with a roll below it (it's a 0 - 100 range).  Players can lower Obligation by relieving the source of pressure, but it will grow over time otherwise.  \n\nThe one of the players had Obligation relating to their past, and had been brought on board the barge by a bounty hunter, who was still on board, waiting to be paid at their destination.  When the players entered the shuttle, he came in behind them.  His exact type was an Apprentice Bounty Hunter (a rival; the enemies are categorized as minion, rival, or nemesis).  This guy was pretty strong, and was going to cause some serious damage to someone.   \n\nSo he shows up right behind them as they enter the ship, and basically is trying to recapture his bounty so he can get his credits.  The players, of course, aren't just going to give the person up.  I was playing hard ball, and was fully prepared for the possibility of someone dying.  They make their move, and luck is in their favor; the game has a dice pool system, and this allows both success/failures and advantages/disadvantages as well as the ability to boost other actions.  The player he is hunting basically gets the best possible roll, and succeed in a disarm action.  So I'm like, hm, ok, what other gear does this guy have?  I look through his stat line, and oh fuck, he has a Disruptor Rifle.  \n\nIf you aren't familiar with Star Wars lore, Disruptor is name for disintegration weapons.  I look up the stats, and it is in fact the best gun in the core game.  I mentally decide that although I didn't really intend for him to walk in here with that kind of power, he _does_ have the gun, so I may as well take it out.  I didn't really _want_ to kill anyone, but this guy is serious.   So he takes it out and fires a blast directly into the only NPC with them, and old human man who escaped with them.  This guy gets destroyed, a huge hole blown in his chest (basically a mercy shot for the players, showing them what they are dealing with).  Well, the players still want to fight, so the character that he is after (the same one who disarmed them) just _picks_ _up_ the heavy blaster pistol that the bounty hunter drops, fires, and combined with the lesser weapons everyone else scrounged up and some more luck, they manage to kill him before he even fires another shot.   \n\nSo great, everyone managed to get out alive, and in his dying breath, the NPC hands them a side quest clue.  But wait - the bounty hunter.  The player he was after loots his corpse, and simply takes the Disruptor Rifle.  So I wound up accidentally giving a level one player the best gun in the game in the first session.    ",

        "text": "Torrent decided on the flight over that he'd prefer to go by Firewall. Thunder Rose had merely shrugged.\n\nOur heroes arrive at Tachyon's space launch facility for their trip through her launch gate to Wagner Mars Base, and find themselves confronted with a trio of killer robots.\n\nThere's a squeal of glee from Unity, and she makes the two heroes promise to not do much damage to the robots, while she works her technopathic powers to find and shut down any others.\n\nFirewall grabs hold of the first robot and uses his cyber-transmission power to access its systems and turn it on the others. Of course this meant that while he was controlling Blue, Alpha and Charlie Robots were attacking Thunder Rose.\n\nTheir lasers were only minor nuisances for her alien skin, and though she took some damage, she was able to electrocute them to do more. That's when Firewall started Operation: Bot-Hop. Moving Blue's  body towards Charlie, he made the one robot shut down as he passed from one to the next. Now that he was in possession of Charlie, he went to do the same to Alpha, but failed the first time. The second time was a success and all the robots were taken down, left intact for Unity to have fun with.\n\nUnity's idea of fun involved scrapping all the robots and crafting a moving middle finger statue for the heroes to show to Wager Master. They gleefully did so as the rocket lifted off.\n\nThrough the jumpgate and up to Mars, their ship docks at the airlock, where the Wager Master appears.\n\n\"Ok. Time for the rules of this leg of your quest. The creators of this Mars Base were kind enough to create a self-destruct. Which will be activated as soon as you enter. There's four keys scattered around, in the hands of some very mean people. You'll need to find those keys and shut off the self-destruct before two hours are up. And you...\" He points to Firewall. \"You are not allowed to hack into the self-destruct sequence. Should you attempt it, thirty minutes will be taken off the countdown clock. Get ready...go!\"\n\nThey enter the base and start searching around. Guise, who has already peeled back the pages of this comic book they're in, wants to make it easier, but every time he opens his mouth, all that comes out is cursing in a parrot's voice. He finds ways around this.\n\nThe first chamber they enter is the base's meteorite defense grid. The lasers turn on them, but Firewall puts up a force field, and they casually walk out, the doors sealing behind them.\n\nNext is the medical bay. Here, Guise uses hand signals to point out the location of the Restora dispensers. Restora is a wonderful super tonic used by the astronauts in Wagner. It cures pretty much any sickness, up to and including space-induced psychosis. Firewall takes five samples and they move onward to the Barracks.\n\nInside the barracks are twelve occupied bunkbeds. The one nearest them rises and reveals himself to be Spite!\n\nHere's a serial killer with a thing for drugs. No, not street drugs. Those are too passe'. Spite prefers the superserums. Things like Mynd-Fyre, and Devil's Kiss. He wears syringes of these glowing concoctions in a bandolier on his chest.\n\nAs the serial killer moves to take a swing at Firewall, the hero responds by locking Spite's arm in a forcefield. Spite uses his other arm to soup himself up, and with a mighty yell (and triple sixes) he shatters the forcefield with brute strength.\n\nHowever, even with that, Firewall puts up another forcefield, this time around the bandolier, so Spite can't access his drugs. Firewall dodges a clumsy attempt at a haymaker, and jabs Spite with the Restora. This has the effect of purging the drug from his system rather quickly, leaving behind a shrimpy arm.\n\nWith a slick of ice under his feet, the serial killer slides into the wall, where in a display of irony, Firewall pins him to the wall with needles. And another slick makes it impossible for him to stand up. They search him for a keycard and once they have it, bottle him in a force field and launch him through the space gate to come to a landing in Insula Primalis.\nThey pass through a cargo dock and narrowly avoid the whole room being depressurized. Getting to another area with the environmental controls still functioning, they find an army of clockwork minions called Wagelings trying to sabotage the water supply. It's a brief battle, that's only temporarily livened up by several of the wagelings forming into a larger one. These are sealed in a forcefield and rolled down the hall, where the astronauts cheer. \n\n\"A new soccer ball! Hooray!\"\n\nAfter the wagelings are beaten and the water supply is saved, the heroes move into another medbay. This one is for quarantine procedures and it's pretty easy to see why. Two beds are occupied, by the dangerous Citizen Truth and Citizen Dare, who serve Citizen Dawn on Insula Primalis. For most of the Citizens, they work well with the others who fit their theme. Truth and Dare hate each other, and probably more, now that they're spewing green foam from their mouths. This is an illness brought on by drinking unfiltered Mars water.\n\nAs the villains and Firewall get ready for a fight, Thunder Rose cracks her knuckles. \"Put up a shield. I got this.\" She gets a triple six roll and uses up all her stunt points to first superheat then superfreeze the Citizens' armor, then she creates a localized tornado inside the medbay. Anything that's not bolted down, including Firewall in his bubble and ten baseball sized projectiles he added, become missiles striking at the citizens for a split 58 points of damage. The two citizens are promptly knocked out. After getting a keycard from Truth, they're quickly launched through the space gate, following Spite. They're dropped into Insula Primalis, where Citizen Dawn has to heal them of their space sickness.\n\nThe heroes pass into the next room, the food storage. Thunder Rose's player keeps up her tradition of failing on perception rolls, so she's treated to \"Gyro in a Tube.\" Can't fit a whole Gyro Stand in a food closet. There's more wagelings here, but the clockworks are almost no concern and most of them are slagged by the heroes' combined might. Two deactivated wagelings are saved for transport back to Unity so she can reverse engineer them.\n\nThe next stop on their whirlwind tour is the trash compactor. There's a loud snuffling followed by scuttling claws, and up from the compactor climbs the fearsome Plague Rat. Born from super science and bad drug deals, the Plague Rat is a danger to anyone...anyone that can't pelt him with lightning and baseballs. Under the combined onslaught from the two heroes, Plague Rat loses his balance at the edge of the compactor, and tumbles in, but not before Firewall pulls a keycard off him.\n\nThe last leg of their adventure takes them into a rec room, where the sound of  thundering hooves approaches. A green rhinoceros charge at them, and on a successful perception test, Firewall notices that the rhino bears the symbol of the Naturalist, and that he's displaying the same space sickness as the two Citizens.\n\nFirewall creates a massive blowgun dart and fills it with the Restora, hitting the Naturalist on his flank as he charges past. This causes the Naturalist to skid to a halt, leaving rhino footprints dug through the metal of the base. But he's back to his senses and after a quick change back into a jumpsuit, he tells them the location of the next hero.\n\n\"We need to save Tempest. He's aboard La Capitan's ship, La Paradoja Magnifica.\"\n\n\"Great. Time Travel.\" Thunder Rose sighs as they get to the self destruct system and shut it down with five minutes remaining. Now it's back to the ship and through the timestream.",

        "text": "[&lt;&lt; previous](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3bwvov/vtmmed_the_new_adventures_of_jalees_kamal_pt_2/)\n\nThere are a total of five packs in the Diocese of the Greater Phoenix Metro Area:  \n*  Pack Spooky Ghosties, specialising in information gathering and reconnaissance, with a minor in interacting with ghosts and using Necromancy. Consists of Spooky.Malkavian, Spooky.Harbinger, Spooky.Nosferatu and Spooky.Pander  \n* Pack Super-Sabbat, the pack of “I am more Sabbat than you are and I can prove it” types: Super.Tzimisce, Super.Lasombra, Super.AbyssMystic, Super.Ventrue and Super.InquisitorTzimisce  \n* Pack Beataturgy, the nominal ‘reject’ pack, full of those considered uncultured, boorish, rude or otherwise unwanted. Fully capable of handing out multiple kinds of ass-kicking: Beat.FunBrujah, Beat.ArgumentativeBrujah, Beat.HotTopicToreador, Beat.AngryGangrel, and Beat.GrappleNosferatu  \n* My favorite, Pack Common Sense, the group I do normal sessions with, who have proven to think *before*, *while* and sometimes even *after* they act: Sense.Assamite, Sense.Gangrel, Sense.Lasombra, and Sense.Toreador  \n* Pack Indirect Fire Support, the pack with the highest woojie-magic to member ratio, specializes in not getting dead and other boring things - explosions and demolitions as well, I’m told: IFS.Koldun, IFS.TremereAnti, IFS.WangaSerpent, and nominally Super.AbyssMystic - *While Super.AbyssMystic is technically part of pack Super-Sabbat, the player attends the pack IFS game, for schedule and distance reasons.*\n\nOf these packs, four decided to participate - everyone except IFS, for obvious reasons. The packs were informed of the rules, given a two hour time limit, and ten minutes and a cardinal direction in which to find a starting point. When asked which direction his pack would take, Jalees responded with “Oh, we’ll find something rather close by to bunker down at. Don’t worry about it.” With that Jalees gave them five minutes of planning, and that the game would officially start at the top of the hour.\n\n--\nAs I try to be not so narcissistic as to subject the other players to bouts of me talking to myself, i.e. between characters I control, this section is drawn from the write up that I give my ST on interactions between my underlings after each session:\n\nJalees called over the third squad of his second wing and explained the situation to them. This game was to be played with cunning and patience, traits which his advanced squads had in full. Sweep Squad, however, could do to practice such things. Sweep Squad was one step above Trainee Squad, the revolving door of recruits that Jalees takes for observation and possible inductance, and had the pleasure of the third most important job in the column: rearguard and cleaner.\n\nSweep Squad were the ones responsible for cleaning all of the safe houses and havens of evidence, burning paper trails and otherwise hiding the passing of the column through an area. Most members of the squad find it to be a boring a unneeded task, thanks to the usual proficiency every other member has of cleaning up after themselves. No lick is perfect, and evidence that has already been collected needs to be cleaned as well. Every recruit passed through Sweep Squad on their way into other squads and there is a mandatory four month Sweep Squad service for all members each decade.\n\nSweep Squad currently consists of five members: Sweep.Andrew, Sweep.Brittany, Sweep.Connor, Sweep.Dah-veed, and Sweep.Erasmus.\n\n&gt;Sweep.Dah-veed: “Should we really make such a commotion so early into our stay, Dominion?”  \n&gt;Jalees: “Yes, and there are three reasons why. Anyone?”  \n&gt;Sweep.Connor: “To gauge potential and gather information about the other Cainites in this Diocese.”  \n&gt;J: “Good, that is the easy one. Next?”  \n&gt;Sweep.Andrew: “To broadcast exactly what sort of skills and abilities we want them to think we have?”  \n&gt;J: “Is that a question or a statement?”  \n&gt;S.A: “We display high competency without showing our full hand.”  \n&gt;J: “Better, but no. Broadcasting strengths also means displaying weaknesses - or what we want to display as a weakness. Thirdly?”  \n&gt;Sweep.Erasmus: “Bolster morale.”  \n&gt;J: “Why?”  \n&gt;S.E: “Can’t be to show up the Inquisition - too public and too many participants. Can’t be to drum up support either, not with Capture the Ductus.”  \n&gt;J: “But why morale?”  \n&gt;S.E: “Nothing else fits. We’re not sure of our first target, gathering intel is out. Unlikely to be any sort of a distraction, the other wing already moved on to the next county to chase leads. Everything is a training exercise when you’re around, so it’s not for that.”  \n&gt;J: “Your reasoning is solid, and your conclusion correct, though I suspect the two unrelated.”  \n&gt;S.E: “I understand that some answers are felt rather than known.”  \n&gt;J: “Good. Now, how shall we aproach this?”  \n&gt;S.D: “With caution. We do not know their capabilities, and so do not know what to expect. We should find a defensible position and wait.  \n&gt;J: “Any opposed? Good. A solid, if slow, opening move. Let us prepare to relocate.”  \n\nJalees and gang waited until the start of the game, then moved to a nearby cafe. A few mortal patrons remained in the early night, and were quickly and quietly persuaded to leave. The tables pushed against walls, chairs stacked out of the way, and the staff convinced to close early for the night. A key was left with Sweep.Andrew to lock up for the night and the lights turned off.\n\nJalees sat in the middle of the open space while the others sat in chairs spread throughout the shop. They sat silently, without fidgeting or breathing, indistinguishable from clothed statues. Jalees looked slightly more slumpy clothe than the others, as he scouted the other teams using Astral Projection.\n\n&gt;Jalees: “Pack Spooky Ghosties and Pack Common Sense seem content to settle out themselves before anyone else. Pack Super-Sabbat is heading our way, but they are moving with caution and planning. Pack Beataturgy will most likely find us first, if any of them pick up our trail.”  \n&gt;Sweep.Dah-veed: “What trail? Did we deliberately leave a trail?”  \n&gt;Sweep.Brittany: “They have a Gangrel in that pack, right? He should find it easy enough to trace us.”  \n&gt;S.D: “What are you taklking about? Shouldn’t we prepare an ambush?”  \n&gt;J: “Yes, Sweep.Brittany. Sweep.Dah-veed, patience. An ambush is unnecessary.”  \n&gt;S.D: “I don’t like it, I have a bad feeling about this.”  \n&gt;J: “You are not yet in tune enough with yourself to look to your feelings for guidance. Patience will allow us to capture their ductus, Beat.FunBrujah, with little incident. Be of empty mind, and the answer will find you.”  \n&gt;S.D: “Cut the Taoist bullshit. What’s the plan?”  \n\nJalees gave Sweep.Dah-veed a calm, knowing stare to pierce his impatience and childishness. “The plan,” he said, “is to wait, be of patient and open mind, and allow the opponent to do all of the hard work for us.” Sweep.Dah-veed quieted down, and tried to be patient. Really, he did. When Jalees gave the signal that the other pack had arrived, however, Sweep.Dah-veed just had to shift his head to get a better look out of the door to see what it was that had arrived.\n\nThis put him in the perfect position to be spotted - his flaxen hair caught just enough light for the movement to be noticed, and Pack Beataturgy charged through the open doors of the cafe.",

        "text": "For those unfamiliar, Edge of the Empire/Age of Rebellion takes place in the Star wars universe. It has a mechanic called Destiny Points which work like fate points, you can cash them in for bonuses. This is from my first game with a new group. They had played two sessions before I joined.\n \nI'm a former Imperial Security Bureau agent who defected to the Rebel Alliance after the destruction of Alderaan. (Male, human, based loosely on Michael Weston from Burn Notice) I had been assigned by alliance command to help a group that had recently taken over an imperial base on Onderon. My job was to scan the bases's systems for any information the alliance could use, then to assist the group in any way I could. So far that had been infiltrating an imperial customs office, and then fighting our way out when that plan went sour.\n\nThe base, as we discovered from markings on trees, was built in the territory of a clan of indigenous people known as beast riders.We were soon contacted by  two representatives on their imposing flying mounts.  They had figured out we were not Imperials and requested that we meet with their tribal council that night to explain ourselves. \n\nUpon disembarking our shuttle, I offhandedly (originally out of character, but then decided to say in character) said \"We should have brought them a nice bottle of whiskey.\"\n\n\"What like a hostess gift?\" scoffed our pilot.\n\n\"Yes, these people are beast riders, not barbarians! It is only polite to bring them something.\"\n\nAt this point the GM tells me I can spend a destiny point, to \"remember\" that there had been a  case of whiskey conveniently stowed in the shuttle from the previous owners.  \n\nWe approach the tribal leaders. As the chosen representative of the group, I present them with the whiskey. They seem pleased and warm up a little towards us. After some initial back and forth conversation to feel each other out, it is time to get down to business.\n\n\"Members of this council\" I begin \"We know that you had unpleasant interactions with the empire. We of the alliance want to assure you that we  are not like them. We will respect your culture and boundaries. Allow us to continue to use the base we have captured, and safe passage through your lands. Unlike the imperials, we will work with you as equals.\"\n\nThe whiskey had softened them up and granted me bonus dice on my roll I ended up with no threat or failures, a Triumph(a crit), an advantage and 2 successes.  \n\nThe tribal leaders discuss my proposal and accept it. We will be allowed to continue operations and they will assist us,  but should they need help it is understood that we will do our best to provide it.\n\nTo celebrate they pass around the whiskey, while also serving out cups of their own local drink that taste ship degreaser but is twice as strong. \nThe celebration last into the night, and the next morning, heavily hungover, the pilot claims I may be married to one of the council members daughters.  \n",

        "text": "[Aaaand we're back with more absurd pathfinder stories! Last time](http://redd.it/3bygoe), our heroes in the [Buster Squad (Pratena the cyclops brawler, Thoth the shabti magus, Barrel the halfling rogue, and Rose the dullahan ranger)](http://imgur.com/a/1azWs) had been doing some investimagation into a town rife with SHADY BUSINESS. Through a combination of luck, inquisitiveness and a handy packet of highly addictive drugs, the party had captured the leader of the nefarious crime ring in the big city. Obviously that means that everything goes back to normal, right?\n\nWrong! With no leader to organize things, and no grand bribemaster making sure things run smoothly, a lot of petty criminals were becoming pissed off. And the crimes turned out to be far, FAR more extensive than anyone could have guessed- within three days, the city was so inundated with mercenaries and sellswords having proxy turf wars that you couldn't leave your house without running into some skirmish. The Buster Squad was called upon by the town watch captain to come help with sorting the mess out, and they arrived to fight their biggest battle yet. In terms of raw numbers, anyway.\n\nThis was another of my \"theme encounters\", and the theme for this session was [Fire Emblem](http://redd.it/3b39p8). They wer given a [huge map](http://i.imgur.com/Pye8Bz9.jpg), a squadron of allies to boss around, and even a healer to patch up whoever got wounded. And people DID get wounded, because the players were outnumbered by about twenty to one in terms of units. In retrospect, this turned out to be a bit much, as even the basic units wound up scoring some lucky hits on the unfortunate party. To add to all this, Betty the murdergolem had returned from the previous session, and had a bone to pick with the party. They had a lot on their plate!\n \nFirst order of business, as the party was concerned, was getting rid of Betty. Thankfully, golems are amazingly stupid and single-minded, and this one was obviously on direct orders to retrieve its boss, the alpaca of evil! So they bundled the sinister mister Fluffles with a random minion, pointed him in the general direction of \"away\", and gave him a goodbye kick to the ass. Betty obediently followed, at a pace so laughably slow that everyone wondered why they had panicked in the first place.\n\nNext order of business was to secure the castle in the lower left of the map- it contained some much-needed reinforcements, and it was technically a government building. Thoth, Barrel and Pratena cleared a bloody swathe through the area, with their backup troops (and special guest star Watch Captain) cleaning up any minor messes while they knocked out the serious threats. Barrel took shelter in a disused church (giving himself a MASSIVE defense bonus, which he needed, because he had been hit pretty hard by some lucky criticals) and proceeded to try and talk the enemy down while Thoth shot lightning at things and Pratena played diplomat.\n\nAnd Rose? Rose was having some FUN. See, while everyone else focused on things like offensive power and cool-sounding abilities, Rose had been speccing out for one thing only... Defense. For this battle, her AC was the ludicrously unfair total of 49- which, for those of you who like trivia, is the same as fucking [Cthulhu](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/aberrations/great-old-ones/great-old-one-cthulhu). Hits rebounded off her with as much effect as a stiff breeze, and she only really ran into trouble when the enemy mages made themselves a nusciance. Still, Rose's saves were up to snuff, and she managed to dodge several maximized fireballs and turn the offending individuals into chutney.\n\nThen she got up against the boss character- the OTHER watch captain, the corrupt-as-fuck one. See, an important component of Fire Emblem battles is the commander, who's liable to kick your ass up and down the street if you're not careful. I had given him monstrous stats, and he had a fortified position, along with a personal retinue that boosted his abilities even higher. To Rose's surprise, the immovable object had encountered the unstoppable force! For every four swings of Rose's spear (at a disadvantage, according to the FE weapons triangle), this fucker would attack six times, and while most of them dinked off Rose's tremendous armor, he also got an astonishing number of crits. And to top it off, he hit fucking HARD. Rose was forced to adopt a more defensive strategy, only counterattacking and focusing on dropping his retinue. After the enemy bard was disposed of, the dickish captain couldn't keep the steam going, and Rose spitroasted him on her flamey spear.\n\nWhile this was going on, Pratena had talked things over with the town baron (a dottering old individual, but apparently sensible) and had aquired a healer to patch everyone up. That was good news! The bad news was that the healer was all the way over THERE, and healing was fucking SLOW oh gods, and Rose couldn't be patched up because she was made of armor. So, Pratena escorted the healer up to the old church where Thoth and Barrel were hunkered down, trying to talk the mercenary hordes out of being idiots. They were actually making progress, as Rose had cut through the mercenary forces like... well, like a flaming spear through the faces of a bunch of idiots. This example had unnerved the mercenaries, and with a little coaxing from Barrel, quite a few of them defected. But they still needed one more push...\n\nThankfully, they had one. See, while the party had invested a lot of time and effort on their own gear, Barrel had also taken a longer view of events and decided to train up some [old friends](http://redd.it/307b54) in case of just such a situation. Also, the wonderful cart that had carried the Buster Squad through their early adventures had gotten a serious tune-up... and that tune was flying airship death-cannons. The going had gotten tough, [and the tough had called for Close Air Support](http://www.schlockmercenary.com/2003-10-02). The warehouses in the upper-left of the map became the subject of a deadly cannon bombardment, courtesy of the Rat Phalanx. Buildings were leveled, and the cowardly business baron hiding within found that his fortress was quickly becoming rubble, and his troops, while well-paid, were not paid NEARLY enough to hang around in a building that was increasingly comparable to swiss cheese. Nobody valiantly stepped in front of the cannon ball hurtling for mister baron's head, either. There's a lesson in there about money not buying everything.\n\nThus, the party had (by various means) secured three-fourths of the map. It had been a long and painful process, mostly for their enemies, and nobody was really looking forward to another slapfest with the remaining enemies who had hunkered down in the upper-right. It was time for a game-changer. Thankfully, Thoth had one, and the Rat Phalanx had another. While Thoth rushed over to Rose to engage his MASTER PLAN, the Rat Phalanx were getting carried away with their game of Blast All The Things and were pointing their guns at the last remaining crime lord. They had an AIRSHIP, and he had some MAGES, so something big was about to go dow-\n\nAnd at that moment, the battered Rose was teleported onto the very surprised crime lord's face. Thoth had been spellcasting, with stage 1 being self-invisibility, and stage 2 being a carefully planned teleport. Rose was the payload, and while she might have been flagging a bit, she was still a very scary suit of fullplate armor made of spikes, flamey spears and general murder. Oh, and she had been hoarding a LOT of spare weapons and metal. What I'm saying is that she was less like a person and more like an extremely hurty anvil that was *on fire*. And she had been teleported directly onto an unfortunate crimeboss's face.\n\nNow, the crimeboss was natrually taken completely off-guard by this, and he became a bit more two-dimensional than is entirely healthy, but things weren't all going Rose's way. See, this crimeboss also had a personal retinue consisting largely of heavy hitters, buff-monkeys and spellcasters. Simply put, Rose was getting curb-stomped, because even little attacks add up, and there was PLENTY to add up. By the end of the attack, Rose was one Will save away from being dismantled, and she just BARELY made it through. She'd started with around 200 hit points, and now she was at 7. Thankfully, step 3 of Thoth's master plan was kicking in right about then- Rose's flailing coutnerattacks had punched a hole large enough for her tactical retreat, and the unfortunate crimeboss was then hit with a blast of cannonfire from the Rat Phalanx and one Maximized Shocking Grasp courtesy of Thoth. With that, the last boss went down!\n\nWith all three leaders gone, the mercenaries broke ranks and fled for the hills. The party had emerged victorious, the day was saved! Except for all the rampant collateral damage that had been caused by Rose's rampage and the Rat Phalanx's cannons. Well, can't have everything. Pratena (being a model citizen) mounted a rescue and relief operation, while Barrel congratulated his ratty pupils on their fine piloting. \"Great work. Now get out of my chair.\" Thoth wandered off (still steadfastly ignoring a torrent of voices in his head that had been plaguing him since last session) and started up a project to restore an old colloseum that had caught his fancy. Rose locked herself in a forge, practically rebuilt her entire body, and then decided that the next business baron was damn well going to be HER.\n\n[NEXT TIME ON \"The Fuzz\", WE NEED TO SYNERGIZE OUR CORE VALUES AND THERE'S NO ONE LEFT TO MURDER?!](https://redd.it/3hxhf7)",

        "text": "So I DM'd a campaign for four of my friends a couple years back. It was my second serious attempt at being a DM, and my friends had never played D&amp;D before. The party consisted of a NE Rogue, a CN Barbarian, a CG Ranger, and a LN Druid, all level 5. The plot was on a fairly stiff railroad, but I did my best to bend my plans based on the party's actions.\n\n\nThe overarching story revolved around these fragments of a special crystal. Each fragment had the ability to protect its holder by absorbing any magic that would affect them, and then the holder could cast the absorbed spell out of the shard, regardless of whether or not they could actually use magic. Each fragment also emanated a strong compulsion aura that drew people towards it until it was claimed. The compulsion aura would then fade, but its holder would then be bound to the fragment, being overcome by a strong desire to keep it safe, and being the only one who could utilize its unique power. The bond only forms when the fragment touches flesh. The party doesn't find out until later that long-term possession of the shard slowly saps your mind and renders you insane.\n\n\nSo the party (specifically the Ranger) gets a hold of one such fragment and they are soon approached by members of the Mages' Collective, including the Archmage Arcadus, who had teleported there after receiving word of the fragment's recovery. The Ranger refuses outright to hand it over and the party is offered a choice: work with the Collective to gather and study the fragments, or be magically exploded. Easy choice. The Collective already possessed a fragment of their own - they had studied it and had found no other way to sever the bond. The party is then told to report to the Mages' Collective headquarters halfway across the country. They couldn't be teleported there because the fragment would have absorbed the spell, and there's no telling where a Teleportation spell cast by a Ranger might send them. So they hop a boat to the closest port (the country had two peninsulas) and hike their way to the headquarters, which happens to be a castle/tower on a huge chunk of rock floating in the sky, accessible only by gryphon transport.\n\nThe party works closely with Arcadus, receiving magical trinkets of insubstantial value in exchange for their services. It's a win-win scenario for all involved. Over the course of several months, the party manages to gather five of these fragments, gathering them all with care so that they do not accidentally initiate a bond. While they go about doing this, a mage of the Collective named Saru is studying a fragment of his own. He has been at it for about two years, and at this point his \"studies\" are more like trances where he simply stares at the crystal for hours at a time. His overexposure to it has basically turned his mind to mush. He hardly leaves his room and only engages in conversation when directly spoken to. He responds in an uncaring monotone. The Ranger would have had an equally grim future in store for her, if not for what happened next.\n\n\n After the party retrieves the last fragment, they assemble in Saru's chambers to see how the fragments will interact with one another. The pieces levitate into the air and drift towards one another, combining into one crystal with a dull red light in its core. At this point, the only people in the room are the party, Arcadus, and Saru. The crystal embeds itself in Arcadus's chest, and he goes limp. Several seconds of panic later, he rises, seemingly unharmed, though with much paler skin. He asks, \"What is my name?\", a question that hints towards amnesia more than anything else. But it is indeed something else.\n\n\nThe party determines that this is not Arcadus, and they want to know what the hell is going on.  He calmly explains that he is a lich from about 200 years ago (once he asks what year it is) and that the crystal that had reformed was the scattered fragments of his phylactery. It was broken but not destroyed, and his essence lingered within every piece, tying him to the material plane by a small thread. It was basically plot nonsense, but it shaped the campaign later on. \n\n\nThe Ranger and the Druid freak out, thinking that the Archmage had been killed in this process, but the lich explains that his soul merely lingers elsewhere for the time being. The Rogue doesn't give a damn who inhabits the body as long as she gets paid and can keep her city lodgings provided by the Collective. The Barbarian is an idiot who is infatuated with the Rogue so he's fine with it too. The Ranger and Druid try to warn the rest of the Collective of what has transpired, but no one believes them and the lich puts on a damn good act. Saru is way too out of it to vouch for their honesty. Very few of the mages actually interacted with the phylactery's fragments, so the story sounds like nonsense. The lich allows himself to be called Arcadus, and for out-of-character reasons to differentiate between the real Arcadus and the lich, my players begin to refer to the lich as \"Arcadus-Not-Arcadus,\" or Ana for short.\n\nA few days pass and Ana seems to be behaving himself. He continues with other research projects that the Collective has been invested in, out of his own curiosities, and aside from being MIA for a large portion of most days, he seems basically harmless. That is, until the Rogue approaches him and asks for a favor. She figures liches are generally bad dudes, so to really test his moral compass (and to satisfy her own desires), she asks if he will take her to her hometown to get some revenge. A Teleportation spell, along with a Wall of Fire and a few Fireballs meta-magic'd to high hell prove to the Rogue that this lich shoots first and never bothers to ask questions.\n\n\nThey never speak of this incident with the party. About a week later, Ana invites the crew to a tavern to drink and celebrate and to thank them for the work that lead to his return to the Material Plane. The Rogue and the Barbarian accept out of genuine interest. The Druid and the Ranger accept out of the fear for the consequences if they refuse. Tensions are high, but things are going smoothly until the lich challenges the Rogue to a drinking contest where the drinks are knowingly spiked with poison. \n\n\nThe Druid, tired of this guy's act and not wanting to see his party member willingly poison herself for a game, turns into some dinosaur and attacks the lich in the middle of the bar. The general crowd flees immediately. The attack scarcely scrapes Ana's mega-enchanted robes. He turns around and politely asks the Druid to stop ruining the fun. Guards come in and slap wrist irons and ankle shackles on the confused dinosaur, causing him to revert from Wild Shape, and escort him away.\n\n\nLater on, when the Druid is out of jail, he returns to the Mages' Collective. I believe the Ranger stuck by him at this point. Together they approach a dwarf mage who had helped them out a few times on a couple of their quests to gather the fragments. They successfully convince him that Arcadus's body has been taken over by a lich, and in turn he is able to convince many of the other mages of the truth behind the matter. They decide to set up an ambush, turning a good 10 or so mages invisible, along with the Druid and Ranger. They would all dogpile onto him the next time he made his way into the courtyard, tossing restraining spells and their bodies at him to keep him held down so they could get some answers.\n\n\nCoincidentally, he shows up not too long afterwards. Unfortunately, it had not occurred to anyone that he might have some source of permanent true vision. He smiles at them and asks if there's a party going on. Everyone is too startled by the massive flaw in their plan to do anything. They simultaneously have a moment of clarity where they realize they were about to attack their Archmage out of blind trust. Embarrassed, they disperse, much to Ana's disappointment.\n\n\nWithin the next few sessions, things take a dark turn. The players discover the purpose behind Ana's frequent departures: He has been traveling back and forth between Planes, feeding the souls of dead warriors his life energy, granting them a tether to the Material Plane much like the one granted to him by his phylactery. He plans to open a rift between the planes to bring his ghostly army through and lead them on a conquest against all things divine. That was probably the only negative aspect that really stood out about Ana's personality - He thought godly worship was pathetic and that divine magic was like having someone else fight your battles for you. He wanted an arcane world, starting with this continent.\n\n\nBy some means that I forget, the party (all level 8 at this point) gets to the Astral Plane, which is where Ana has been assembling the army. They intend to face off against him, sever his links to the Material Plane, and find Arcadus's soul to return it to his body. In the dull planar landscape, they find him, standing on a grassy hilltop overlooking his army of souls. He greets them and wonders if they would like to participate, offering rewards for their services, greater than anything they have been given thus far. The Druid and Ranger refuse, of course, denouncing him for the evil being that he is. Meanwhile, the Rogue is standing there with her arms crossed, seriously contemplating the offer. The Barbarian sits down next to her and waits for her to make a decision.\n\n\nAna conjures a Phantom Steed and soars overhead, ready to rain all hell down upon them, though the lending of his own life force to the ghostly army has weakened him substantially. The Druid and Ranger scold the Rogue for her seemingly inevitable betrayal, but decide that the lich must be destroyed now, before his plan can unfold. Combat begins; the Ranger shoots volley after volley at Ana's chest, aiming for the spot where she remembered the crystal had originally embedded itself within Arcadus. The Druid wildshapes for some combat stats and casts lightning bolts and other ranged spells, successfully destroying the Phantom Steed on two separate occassions.\n\n\nThe Rogue completely ignores the battle and rubs her chin as she ponders what to ask for in exchange for her services.\n\n\nAna actually falls to about 20% HP over the course of the fight. The Druid and Ranger were doing obscenely well, but I was holding back to some extent - After all, half of the party was out of the fight. Out-of-character, I give the Rogue and Barbarian one last chance to reconsider. The Rogue sides with the lich, and the Barbarian sides with the Rogue. With a final hail of two fireballs, the Druid and Ranger are defeated.\n\n\nThe lich's plan goes smoothly. His ghostly army is nigh unstoppable, each soul able to return to the Material Plane shortly after death/banishment thanks to his tethers. The supporters of the divine form a resistance run by Clerics that is pushed all the way back to a single city in the northeast of the country. The Rogue is granted a privileged position in Ana's private council of the Mages' Collective and the Barbarian is instilled as the leader of a small and pointless frontier village to give him some illusion of power.\n\n\nThe Rogue being Neutral Evil and the Barbarian being both dumb and in love with the Rogue definitely factored into the outcome of the campaign, but not so much as the complete lack of allies that the party was able to obtain. It's surprisingly hard to convince people to hurt someone likeable. \n",

        "text": "I was on Primal Carnage, and after finding that the two best RP servers weren't RPing at that point in time, I had decided to go play some Get to the Chopper. With my trusty cooling-fan at my side IRL, I spawned in, went to the human team, and the server instantly finished the round. This switched me onto dino team- which I was happy about.\n\nOn the other hand, the only human had just left, leaving three dinosaurs twiddling their thumbs. Never mind, mueheheheh.\n\nNow, there's five classes on each team. The dinos have the mighty, player-limited Tyrant, the swift, pouncing Predator, the fast, charging Bruiser, the small, ranged Spitter and the aerial, scouting Carrion. The humans have the fire-loving, chainsawing Pyro, the net-launching, \"WINNER WINNER CHICKEN DINNER\" Trapper, the shotgun-wielding, flare-throwing Pathfinder, the grenade-launching, machine-gunning Commando and the sniping, healing Scientist.\n\nI chose the Scientist, widely considered- when not curbstomping Tyrants via the tranq rifle- to be fairly weak. They chose the Tupandactylus (largely irrelevant to the tale) and the Novaraptor respectively. The Novaraptor was one variety of the Predator class- widely considered to be one of the strongest classes in the game, especially against lone targets.\n\nOh, how wrong they were this time.\n\nThe match started. I darted from cover to cover, checking the surroundings for the enemy. I looked up, checked the cliff. The Nova- it hadn't noticed me. I had noticed it, though. I lifted my rifle, scoped in- Blam! Headshot. The ragdoll did a backflip from the force of the shot.\n\nI sprinted at maximum speed to the first objective, a large building, and promptly typed \"BOOM HEADSHOT\" into the chat, finding this hilarious. The Novaraptor soon arrived, hissing and clawing at its prey. I scored a hit in the leg as the Tupandactyl arrived, running in through a tunnel, beak snapping. I hit the Nova in the chest, sending it spinning to the floor. The Tupa was still approaching, so I crouched down and shot it in the face, killing it instantly.\n\nThe raptor had respawned by now. While I wasn't looking, it had sprinted behind the crates. I heard it roar- a deep screech, whipping itself into a frenzy, ready to come at me in a hurricane of claws.\n\nThe objective was completed first. It teleported outside as the area became a human safe zone. I spotted something at one of the entrances- the other player had respawned as the Oviraptor, which was much like the Nova but much pouncier. \"Scuse me m8\" I typed, and promptly shot it in the face.\n\nI sprinted over to the cliff, using it as cover. They can't eat you if they can't see you. I turned the corner, and checked the roof- just in time to see the Oviraptor hopping up to use it as a perch. Bad idea to go high when there's a sniper below you. I shot at it- the first two missed, but its reactions weren't fast enough to avoid being brained by the third shot.\n\nMy cover was blown- I ran. The Nova arrived, and managed to rip me to shreds. \"WOOT BACKFLIP\" I typed as my ragdoll cartwheeled into the ground at the final blow- the ragdolls were hilarious today. But they'd forgotten one thing. _Humans can respawn too._\n\nFirst respawn. I stealthily entered the base. The Oviraptor spotted me, and charged up the hill in the face of my gunfire. It pounced, sailing through the air as I fired at it. It landed, pinning me to the floor and grabbing me by the head, thrashing me to death as the Novaraptor arrived.\n\nSecond respawn. I climbed a small hill. Bad idea- The raptors spotted me easily, and the Nova mauled me again.\n\nThird respawn. I got in, the Nova did too, and it ate me once more- although I managed to headshot the Ovi when I spotted it crouching in the building as well. \"still got a headshot\" I typed.\n\nFourth time, I had a minute and a half left. I went in quickly and quietly, using the grass and bushes as cover as I approached. I shot the Novaraptor in the face again, and got in.\n\nThe Nova typed, \"I still have no idea what he's doing,\" as I looked over the slopes below.\n\n\"killing a bitch\" I replied, my sense of humour still as mature as ever.\n\nBoth raptors promptly left the game.",

Isn't that what you're supposed to do with a weapon?\n\nSasha: well yes, but I was hoping for something a little more...fun?\n\nBerzerker: Fun? Nothing is more fun than hitting your best buddy repeatedly with an axe.

What is that, does it involve axes and blood?\n\nAt this time I make my appearance and take Sasha to the side\n\nHeretek: flesh sack, you do realize that astartes are sterile, and have no sex drive or concept of reproduction right?

        "text": "https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3cn6qk/pathfinder_ic_journal_entry/    First entry\n\nToday nothing happened at the sewers where I was to meet this strange contact. I write again tomorrow. \n\nToday is the day that I am to meet the whomever contacted me to move some cargo. The destined time is tonight at midnight. I have set up a sort of stakeout across the street and have been watching. A man arrived a few hours early, and he looked just ever so slightly out of place. If I hadn't been looking for him, I probably wouldn't have even noticed him. He moved like an Elf. \n\nHours later several others would arrive. Two women, and two men. One of them was tall, and one was short. So one of those men was a Gnome, or halfling, one of the shorter races. The women were like two sides of a coin, one had small horns and appeared abyssal in origin. The other glowed slightly in the dark, appearing almost celestial. Interesting travel companions. \n\nThe motley bunch waited around outside, barely acknowledging each other until a cart drawn by Oxen and led by Orcs stopped and talked to them. After a short while, the group departed. I wish I could tell you what was said, but unfortunately I do not speak Orc. \n\nOnce the group was on the way, I made my way down from my perch and entered the sewers, and stopped. The Elf never left, he likely had the same idea as I did. I called out to him, that I knew he was there and why, and he emerged from the shadows. We didn't speak to each other, and made our way, following the cart. \n\nThe walk was long and the Elf and I, or maybe half elf, followed in silence. The cart eventually encountered guards, and the celestial being took to the lead and managed to talk her way through them. I must confess, I did not have a plan to get through the guards, and while the Elf took to sneaking, I just simply walked to the guards, and told them I was with the cart, and they let me through. I joined the procession, told them I was contacted and didn't trust it, so I had watched. They accepted this, and off we went in general silence, everyone on guard. The Elf joined us at some point, but I do not recall exactly when.\n\nThe cart we were with was a trash cart. Trash was piled into it, and then Orcs and Goblins took it into the sewers to manually dump it. My contact in the guild told me about what was being transported, and I assumed it was just placed within the trash. I was right, but only somewhat. We met with another cart and our Orc opened the back of the cart, revealing the trash was a clever illusion when he reached up and 'opened' a door hidden in the back of it. The Orcs silently loaded marked boxes into the back, and I caught a glimpse of the Arcane mark I had seen earlier this week, the arrows pointing at a loop.\n\nThe night went on, and we stopped at several factories as monstrous creatures loaded the cargo silently. This was the first time I had seen the conditions that these beings lived in, and my contact had told me what the cargo was. This had grave implications for the future. I know the ruling class is not highly regarded either. \n\nAfter we stopped at our final factory, we proceeded again, and I noticed a lot of straw. I knew the ambush was coming just seconds prior. The straw was lit on fire, and we sprung into action. Multiple people were around us, firing spells and arrows from rooftops at us. \n\nI did not pay entire attention to the group and their arrayed abilities, as I kicked in a door of the nearest building. I drew my mace, and set about stopping the man. I will not continue this, as killing a man still puts a bad taste in my mouth, and I do not wish to remember this part of the night, but just know dear reader, that none of the ambushers left that night.\n\nOnce the ambush was dispatched, we continued, as we were running out of nighttime to move our illicit goods. The last bit of the night was easy in comparison, as we finally made our way through the final part of the city, and back into the sewers. \n\nIn the depths of these great, artificial caverns, was a pool full of waste, with a small barge waiting in it. In the middle of the pool was a portal, a clever way to move the refuse of an entire floating city. We boarded the barge and sailed into the portal without asking where it went, but I knew where I was going.\n\nWe arrived in the Scar, the desolate wasteland beneath the floating city, honestly a hellhole that the beasts who keep the city running lived in. I can only imagine the contempt that they feel for us, living in a city floating over them, while they toil in trash and never see the sun. \n\nThis party sailed in silence, the group still exchanging few words to each other. The two men who arrived together seemed to know each other, at least a little bit. The celestial woman was some dancer from the city I had heard of, but never seen, while the abyssal woman was a stranger to all, along with the elf. \n\nAt the end of the river, was a palace, far too grand to really exist. I suspect there might be strong illusion magic at work here, as there are invisible magical servants waiting on every command. \n\nWe were asked to clean ourselves as the Queen who lived here did not enjoy the scents we had about ourselves, and I can hardly blame her. We washed ourselves, and I learned a bit more than I'd have cared about my abyssal companion. \n\nOnce we were finished, we set down the hall to meet the queen. Some of our group argued about wearing fine clothes or armor, but I didn't care much personally, as I always wore my armor under my tie and coat. I suspected the queen to want the finer things from my surroundings, and my belief was confirmed. \n\nThe queen was an Elven maiden, who walked and talked with us each one at a time, and when it was my turn, my suspicions were confirmed. She was attempting to befriend me, but I did not trust her words, and thus carefully guarded my words, but she made sure to make a thinly veiled threat. \n\nAfter she was finished with talking to each of us, she sent us back to our room, taking the abyssal woman with her. A woman I would be unable to trust now. \n\nI will have to do research when I return to the city, I do not trust this Elf, and she will not tell us her name. I will need to know about her before I will trust anything about her. I suspect she will use the 'cargo' she is moving around the city to arm her monstrous horde, and will attempt to invade the city from the sewers during the night when they sleep. \n\nWe will see.",

        "text": "In my previous tale, I related how Jake Monsoon, the shitty, unoptimized \"Combat Lawyer\" (Monk) successfully evaded the jaws of two Ankhegs while leaving all of his fellow adventurers to die. When I successfully escaped, the DM had me make a survival roll to see whether or not Jake would be able to find his way home.\n\n&gt;24 total\n\nJake manages to get back to the hub town with absolutely no problems. However, in a plot twist reminiscent of M. Night. Shyamalan (not really), two of his abandoned compatriots were actually able to survive the encounter! Although the ranger who had originally led the party was still thoroughly torn in half, Sven the sorcerer and Paul the barbarian managed to stabilize despite the odds and recover! \n\nThe DM had them wake up with 1 health in the Ankheg's cavern next to their extremely dead Ranger. Paul, the Barbarian, woke up first, and with his night vision was able to locate Sven and hightail it out of there with no real problems. However, they still need to head back to town, and the limited party, lead by Paul, are forced to make the same survival roll that Jake did. Can they do it?\n\n&gt;4\n\nThey horribly fail, and end up wandering around for a while in the darkness. Eventually they find a clearing and sleep, but the wilderness is a dangerous place and they know that they have to get back to town or risk death. They leave after their short rest and prepare to head out into the unknown once again, requiring another survival check as per the norm.\n\n&gt;10\n\nThey make no progress and are stuck in the same goddamn plains. Since they were already rested, they continue to move. Survival check?\n\n&gt;3\n\nTo explain the system the DM uses, if you fail a survival check, he rolls to see what direction you go in. In this case, Paul and Sven inexplicably return to the same Ankheg lair, and wisely decide to leg it. Now that they have a sort of idea where to go, the DM decides that they will have an easier time getting home, with a lower DC for the survival roll. Can they do it?\n\n&gt;5\n\nThe poor bastards have gotten about as much breaks as your average Foxconn worker at this point. At this point, however, both Sven and Paul are feeling exhausted, and decide to set up camp. Although they still may be hopelessly lost, at least they can get some rest.\n\nThat is, until Paul spies a pair of wolf-looking people and the half-party runs away yet again, leaving behind some of Paul's supplies in the panic. Yet another survival check was required, as per tradition, and Paul and Sven manage to further uphold the tradition by rolling a 7.\n\nThey wind up in a clearing with a camp somewhat close to them, and being the adventurers that they are, they decide to check it out. The first thing they notice is 3 goblins watching them with their beady, mischievous eyes, and decide to approach them. As soon as the goblins see them, they begin talking in their language to each other, watching the party, particularly Paul, nervously. Although Paul could kind of understand their language, all he could understand was that the goblins were trying to figure out just who the hell they were. \n\nAfter both sides stared at each other for a lengthy amount of time, one of the goblins asked if the party was lost, to which they responded in the affirmative. Another round of goblin conversing, and both Sven and Paul make a Sense Motive check, and the DM is gracious enough to tell them that the Goblins are going to attack them. The Dice Gods are fickle masters indeed, and both Paul and Sven roll higher than they ever had for their survival checks, almost instantly killing the Goblins. A subsequent Search check reveals that the Goblins had nothing of note, and the party is forced to move on. They destroyed a bunch of goblins even though they had 1 health, maybe their luck can hold...\n\nSo after thoroughly proving Murphy's law over and over again, the duo find the town! They rush towards it, eager to get some real rest and relaxation. As they approach the town, however, the surroundings look... wrong, and walking by, they realize that they have approached a different town than the one they needed to get to. Resigned, but still determined, they decide to flag down one of the locals in order to see if they can find a place to stay. Instead, they find a gruff, sour looking man, who, after appraising the duo, simply tells them, \"You probably want to go south.\" Although they want to get more information out of the man, they decide better of it, and decide to follow the south road to their actual town. Finally, the DM calls for another Survival check, saying that this check will be far easier, considering they'll be following a road.\n\n&gt;5\n\nAt this point, the DM is debating whether or not to just kill the poor bastards off due to exposure or something. Eventually, he reaches a consensus- he has the unfortunate players hand him their character sheets. They are now listed as MIA, and the DM has them roll up new characters. \n\nAnd in the stars above, the normally indifferent Dice Gods allow themselves a brief, cruel smile before returning to their uncaring machinations. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

No matter when we go up against them, something always goes horribly wrong and we fail miserably. One instance of this was the Pathfinder session we had a week ago which... I don't want to talk about. Like, I still cry when I think about it. It was that bad so let's pretend it never happened. The other notable instance was in one of our very first games of D&amp;D, which I will go into now.\n\nNames have been left out to ensure that other people we know can't laugh at us.\n\nThe story takes place in the zombie apocalypse. Orcus the king of the undead stepped on everything and now zombies were all over the place. The lead characters consisted of a warforged fighter, a tiefling sorcerer, an elf ranger, and a gnome artificer played by yours truly who usually ended up riding in the warforged's backpack and acting like a crossbow turret. We all happened to be chaotic neutral as well. Now, this wasn't the the asshole, steal from the group and kill indiscriminately flavor of chaotic neutral, we were just a subtle aftertaste of insanity. We weren't gibbering bonkers mind, we were the kind of guys who would sit around, calmly doing their own thing when one of them says, \"Hey, you know what we should do?\" This led to some very schizophrenic adventures, such as the time we started a rave party at the guard barracks so we could raid their armory. Or the time I broke into a guy's house and disassembled all his furniture so I could come back later and offer to fix it all for cash. One of the others said, \"You know, if you want money you could always look for a job\", to which my guy replied with, \"Oh, didn't think of that.\"\n\nSo with that out of the way, on to the pain. We were all chilling in our room when the barkeep, my boss as I had recently been hired to maintain the distillery, came over and said he had a job for us. Weird noises were coming from the house down the street and he wanted us to investigate. We said sure then walked over and bashed their windows in and blew the door off its hinges with some explosives I made. Silent and discrete, like a ninja wearing saucepans in a minefield. We find a trapdoor where the noise is coming from and kick that open as well. Inside we find a lovely cult  trying to summon an aspect of Orcus so it can go wreck the city's collective shit. So nothing really all that suspicious. We were about to turn back around and tell the boss we found the noise when the ranger noticed a pretty necklace that one of the cultists was wearing and decided he wanted it.\n\nRanger- \"Hey, you know what we should do?\"\n\nCombat ensued. Heads were bashed, magic was thrown, and I was using my little robot I named Jerry to do the fighting for me. The cultists were trying to get the ritual done as quickly as possible while fending us off. But, the fight was quickly heading in our favor. All we needed was one more round to mop these losers up and we would have our hands on that pretty-\n\n*DING!* Satan's ready. Please remove from tray and let cool for zero minutes before murder.\n\nAs this massive demon, at least 15 levels above us, rises from the circle and squashes the cultists, I ask the others, \"Hey, you know what we should do?\"  So we grabbed the necklace from the stain that was now the cultist and got right the hell out of there. The demon busts out of the basement, blows up the largest buildings in town, then puts a massive hole in the wall keeping the zombies out before tapping out to go get its nails done or something. We spent the next few days fighting the zombies that got through while trying to fix the wall.\n\nA week passed since the incident and we were all looking over the destruction caused by our failure to stop the ritual.\n\nWarforged- \"Well, we kinda fucked everything up.\"\n\nEveryone else- \"Yeah...\"\n\nA few seconds pass.\n\nTiefling- \"Hey, you know what we should do?\"\n\nAnd that's how a bunch of level two adventurers decided they were going to incite a revolution to take over a city after accidentally unleashing a super demon on it. Like I said, we weren't assholes, we were just a special brew of insane and unlucky. \n\nAfter the fact, the GM told us that he had actually delayed the summoning for a few rounds because we were taking so long and couldn't believe we had fucked up hard enough to let the ritual complete. This worries me because I only remember there being about four or five rounds before  Satan crashed the party and forgot to bring the chips but packed plenty of salsa. So I guess either we suck super hard or the GM had his expectations set a bit too high. Given our last Pathfinder session, I think it might be the former. Yes, it really was that bad. No, I don't want to talk about it.",

We pondered over the jobs laid out before us and decided that we'd travel to a small nearby farming village to stop someone's fourteenth daughter marrying into a lesser family.\n\nTwo days ride we get there, no one has really gotten the chance to do anything yet besides talk about themselves and such.\n\nWe get to the outskirts of the town and can see that a small wedding is taking place. There does seem to be a few armed men with pitchforks and axes and such - they were probably expecting resistance. One of the party members attempts to sneak their way around but ends up getting caught and the fight ensues.\n\nWe all roll initiative and my friend, the Alchemist, goes first.\n\nHe begins running towards the party and preps one of his bombs to throw. He rolls and misses. We consult the rules and figure we need to roll to see which way the bomb is actually heading. It heads in his own direction, back at him, exactly the range increment that would put the bomb right on his spot.\n\nHe threw the bomb, and a huge gust of wind and a gypsy's curse sent the bomb flying right back into his face. He rolls reflex to see if he can dodge to at least take half damage.\n\n[b]CRITICAL FAIL[b]\n\nHe confirms the critical fail and as a result I make him take double damage from his own bomb. He knocks himself down to -10 HP, he has 1 more left before he dies. He rolls to see if he stops bleeding out, he fails. He dies.\n\nTL;DR Alchemist throws bomb and by bad luck kills himself with it on the first action of a new campaign.",

        "text": "In the dark and dreary world of the future, where plotholes destroy the planet and humanity has regressed to taping cookware to their shoulders for survival, three figures stand above it all. Three wanderers making their way through the hellish wastelands of the dry, barren world. Some know them as... player characters. \n\nUp first, we have Boris, Gunlugger and walking wall of meat. He's a teddy bear with an LMG.  \nNext is Fracture, Battle Babe, spunky hurt machine decked out in spiked chains. A mean shot with a hand cannon.  \nFinally, we have Honest Ed, the Savvy Head repair guy, shift sumbitch. Worthless in combat (my character).\n\nOur journey begins, traveling through the dried-up wastes of the gulf of mexico, desperately looking for civilization. Things look grim, because nobody packed a vehicle and supplies were low, which is why it was good that two motorcycles were hurtling towards them, brandishing weapons. Ed dashed behind Boris and screamed about not shooting the bikes, while Boris gave the raiders an impromptu lesson on why you do not charge an LMG-wielding juggernaut out in the open.\n\nEd then proceeded to coo over the injured motorcycles, trying to find ou-  \nBabe  \nSweetie  \nGirl SHUT YOUR EXHAUST PIPE, I wanted to help out with your burst tire, I didn't need your life story-  \nNO I DON'T WANT TO GO STEADY JEEZE\n\nOne patch job and uncomfortable motorcycle ride later, the party was off to greener pastures! The Hold that the party emerged into was a bustling affair, filled with tents. TENTS! These people were clearly swimming in money. Ed quickly set about constructing his \"discount repair shop\" while Boris gave everyone friendly greetings and Fracture hunted for jobs. Fracutre found jobs, Boris found people being evasive and cautious, and Ed found himself getting an indictment for putting his shop in the middle of the largest road in town (arguments of \"ease of access\" and \"fast auto repair\" fell on deaf ears). Thus, the party set off to capture a bounty on someone named Iron Wang.\n\nThe party searched the criminal districts of the town, the slums and backalleys. Boris kept getting carried away playing with kids, Fracture kicked up a conversation with a brain damaged merchant selling pet rocks, and Ed literally tripped over the guy while planning his escape route through a barn. Thankfully, Iron Wang was living up to his name, and Ed was able to sneak away without interrupting the *business* that was going on between the ruffian and his companion.\n\nA plan was formed. Ed would go up front, make sure he had the right guy (by screaming his name), Fracutre would provide ranged cover, and Boris would be using the side entrance. No, not the other door, the other *entrance* that Boris could access by walking at *this wall*, right here. It's a SEEEECRET entrance!\n\nThe plan went marvelously, except for the part where Iron Wang freaked out and threw his ladyfriend out of a second-story window. However, he calmed down when Boris arrived through the \"side entrance\" (covering everything with wood and splinters) and convinced the unfortunate man that it wasn't worth a fight. We'd literally caught him with his pants down. Fracture bound him up by his tenders, and Boris rushed to the aid of the unfortunate lady with the broken neck and tenderly escorted her to a hospital.\n\nThat done, the party congratulated themselves on a job well done and got a place to stay for a while. The town was growing on them, and Ed had managed to successfully start up his discount repair shop. However, they had to go and introduce themselves to the leader of the place, say a few how-do-you-do's, and get citizenship and stuff. And of course this goes spectacularly wrong. See, the buddies of Iron Wang were causing a ruckus with a hostage situation in the mayor's tent, and Ed brazenly walked in and asked what was happening. He was immediately shot twice.\n\nThe now panicking Ed scrambled behind Boris, who smashed one of the supports of the tent and sent the head ruffian tumbling head over heels, cracking his skull on an end table. Fracture opened up with a new sniper rifle (that she had pillaged from Iron Wang) with some armor piercing bullets (also looted from Wang), dropping dudes with their boss's personal arsenal. Ed directed more fire towards Boris, who was armored up to the eyeballs and just laughed as the bullets pinged off him. He stopped laughing when the last goon whipped out a grenade launcher.\n\nFracture put the rest of the goons out of commission while Boris kept the launcher goon busy, Ed came up with a WONDERFUL GENIUS PLAN. He hooked his taser to a copper wire and threw it over the grenade launcher, sending a painful burst of electricity into the goon's hands. Then Fracture blew the poor sod's arm off. In a fit of brain damage and blood loss, the goon decided to keep up the attack and stabbed Ed before Boris put him down for good. Seriosuly, that's some suicidal bravery there.\n\nWith that, we dusted our hands and attended to the hostages (nobody had been paying attention to them, like, at all) when all the sudden the mayor bust in. Apparently he was late to his own hostage situation. However, he was quite impressed with our initiative (as Ed whined about bullet and stab wounds) and a quick bout of haggling later, the part had a place in mister mayor's personal errand force!\n\nNot bad for a first session, eh?",

Her magic was all for support however. She needed something to help if she could no longer use her spells. She searched far and wide until she came across a blacksmith. He told her of a pair of magical mirrors. Mirrors that reflected the soul of the user. The greater their will the stronger the mirrors became. He had heard tale that they were a pair of ancient daggers. Not mirrors. But they couldn't be used by just anyone. \n\n\nThe bard and her great guardian ran off to the legendary cavern as fast as their feet would carry. Upon entering they were trapped. The door sealed shut with a Crack. Through perilous tunnels and deadly traps they stormed. But not once did her will waver. She needed them to help protect her lover. And he simply wanted her to be happy. So they trod on. Eventually they reached a spherical throne room. Nestled in a bed of gold were the mirrors. beautiful daggers seemingly made of glass. Reflecting everything out of them. As she picked them up her entire life and her very soul flashed before her. Through a rigorous process was she put through. Questioned and and questioned. Until eventually. The mirrors accepted her will. Deciding her to be a worthy master. Upon this they left the dungeon and began a new journey. Where it would take them no one person knew.\n\nUntil they Stumbled upon a very large caravan looking for guards. They joined up after testing with the leader. Upon this they began their new life. Sleeping in moving wagons. And fighting off bandits each day. Eventually when posted as the main frontal scout guard they find a well. Easily the bard realizes it is trapped and tells her lover to stand back. Upon using her charismatic magic and great daggers she speaks to the tripwires. They understand her need. And she understands them. They only wish to do what they were made for. But she wished to live as well. With a great tear running down her face she cut each wire swiftly. Ending it as quickly as possible. Upon this her life changed for the better. She would fight for all life from now on. Even if others could not understand why. ",

        "text": "Cecilia Svensonne. My character for a homebrew game a pal is running. A CG human Cleric [Healing, Freedom], a cultist from an apocalyptic world. When she arrived in the realm of the damned after her death, she was armed with nothing but a shield, a desire to help, and an intense hatred of the gods. To her, the gods had abandoned all hope to the mortals of the multiverse, and for it they deserved to be overcome and punished by mortal will.\n\nTL;DR- Mythic party Healer begs the source of her power to not kill the party, takes the path of violence.\n\nThe game started at level 5, to suggest we were already local heroes by the time we died. Of the standing party: Cecilia fell into lava fighting pirates which were trying to overrun the damaged state her world was in. Party half-elf Fighter, Stryder, died attempting to stop Cultists trying to summon Ragnora. The party half-elf Wild Caller Summoner, Cyrus, and his Eidolon, Mincer, died when Ragnora fell on him from space (the Summoner and the Fighter never knew one another, same world). The elf Magus, Yolland, died trying to steal a Helm of Brilliance from a blue dragon (which turned out to be a lesser helm of brilliance and the Magus was mildly disappointed when we rescued her, she didn't start at 5 with us but stepped in later). The dragon-riding elf Rogue, Kaemar, died defending her homeland. The orc Barbarian, Hakok, died during tribal combat. Our goal that was given to us was to collect six Seals bound to mortal sins, so we may earn power and a second chance at life.\n\nThe party has since leveled all the way to level 15 and Mythic tier 2-3. Along the way, Cecilia A) Discovered not only was she not human, but she used to exist as a mind trapped in the very shield she wields, B) Lost her left arm as the realm's 'way' to restore the balance between herself and the shield, causing her arm to slowly petrify to obsidian, and that C) Her divine magic wasn't because she cared so much about her party...\n\nIt was because a god-like entity known as 'Mother' (unrelated to Ragnora, Lamashtu, or the Mother series) cared that, of all the evil to have passed through the realm, Cecilia would so selflessly throw herself into harm's way to save others (a trait it thought they had in common).\n\nWe get to the point where we actually face Mother, and the party is ready to slay some omega-weapon level entity apparently responsible for a large chunk of the warped divine magic in the realm. Hasted and in near peak, the party charges, and in the space of nearly 6 rounds, deals nearly 3,000 damage to the monstrosity. Being the only one in the party with Deathwatch, Cecilia notes that Mother is near enough to Death to act herself, not wishing to give Mother any chance to recover. She casts Harm, and charges.\n\nInstead of dealing enough damage Cecilia was sure she could kill Mother (with 75 dmg on half, easy), Cecilia vanishes from existence and Mother is restored to full. Mother goes berserk and kicks up the heat.\n\nCecilia finds herself in what would appear to be the inside of Mother's mind. A featureless void, with a large viewport displaying what appeared to be the party from Mother's perception, and a sobbing child (not creepy in the slightest). Cecilia drops her guard entirely, and recognizing that the child might listen to reason better than the monster outside rearing to kill her party. At first, she tries Calm Emotions, which backfires and causes the child to spasm in pain and stalls Mother on the party's side.\n\nShe dismisses the Calm Emotions and begs on her hand and knees for Mother to not kill her party, that there has to be some way she can save or free the creature from its torment. The child gets oddly calm and equally lethal, so Cecilia does the only thing she knew to do.\n\nShe drew a mining pick from her bag, apologized, and drove it through the child's head.\n\nBeams of light escape from Mother on the party's end, and she violently explodes, expelling Cecilia into the world. The tower the party had been ascending immediately begins collapsing as Mother's mask falls to the floor. As Cecilia tries to rise, the baby axebeak she had been raising nearly the entire campaign starts to fade (apparently a \"gift\" from Mother to Cecilia). As she embraces it, both of her holy symbols catch fire and burn to ash. She had two; an ankh tattooed to the palm of her right hand, and one affixed to the front of her shield. In addition, she hits Mythic tier three, gets her second Legendary Item path ability, and the shield goes Minor Artifact.\n\nWhich, due to the arrangement that had been previously set for when this happens, the petrification of her left arm rapidly spreads from about the middle of her upper arm to about the middle of her clavicle, down along her chest to about the fourth rib up, up the back halfway across the shoulder blade, a tiny sliver shooting up the back of the neck, back down again along the jugular to meet along the clavicle.\n\nIn the space of about a round, she's about put out of business for the day.\n\nExhausted, the party gathers up Cecilia and what loot they can, and we continue up the tower (we're there to save another child, the son of an NPC traveling with us). We arrive at the top, to classically find 'Death' holding the Seal of Envy (a powerful artifact, one of 6 and the party has 4, which eats the souls of those who are chosen to bear it). The npc traveling with us, Karalle, is on her knees, defeated, holding a scimitar seemingly made of mercury. \n\nDeath screams something about finding his soul, and vanishes (son of a bitch). Party instantly assumes Death killed Karalle's son, Carl, who was the intended bearer of the Seal and that we were just seconds too late to save him.\n\n[Party escapes and rp aftermath ...still somewhat updating.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rrZTJFlpQZCyioULiVVTJtbIsZZnKBBHaCbcKY_FngI/edit?usp=sharing)",

        "text": "During the school year, my friend, who is experienced at DMing, started making plans to hold a \"Westmarches\" style campaign. I wasn't entirely aware of what this entailed at the time when I started character creation, besides the fact that different people would show up to each session. I figured that since there would be a different group each time, the experience would be fairly easier than your average DnD 3.5 game. With this in mind, I created a fairly gimmicky character- Jake Monsoon, the Combat Lawyer. With high stats in Wisdom and Intelligence, the Level 1 Monk who looked like a swole Phoenix Wright could fight baddies with one hand and present exonerating evidence for his client with the other. I figured that, since I had a high wisdom stat, I wouldn't have to have a high dexterity, and I could instead focus on skill points so I could be the most proficient combat lawyer I could possibly be.\n\nI was wrong. So, so wrong.\n\nEven for an average campaign, monks are notorious for being useless until the higher levels, and this was not an average campaign. The DM almost exclusively uses random encounter tables, and they are not, nor are they supposed to be, balanced. At all. This means that Level 1 characters, if they make unlucky rolls, could face a Devourer. The rest of the party members could hold their own in a fight, mind you, but poor Jake, being an unoptimized combat lawyer, was almost insta-gibbed by five rats Session 1. \n\nSession 2 with Jake started off on the wrong foot, with Jake trying, and failing, to find a Potion of Cure Disease in the hub town- the same five rats that almost killed him also gave him a disease that made him even easier to kill. Luckily, this gave Jake, and his steadfast companions (of which 2 were entirely new characters) a quest- the Quest for the Potion! Of course, we had no idea where that would be, so we decided to head north to some ruins that we had never been able to get to in Session 1. So Jake, a ranger, a barbarian, and a sorcerer headed to the mysterious ruins. Although Jake had a relatively high survival modifier for a level one character (+6), he elected to let the ranger lead the way. The ranger was sure to get us to where we needed to go, right?\n\n&gt;Ranger rolls a 1\n\nJake and his party, after aimlessly wandering the plains, find a small dirt hill. With a large hole in it. A smart party would have avoided it, or at the very least prepared for a fight. We approached it, and we promptly get jumped by an Ankheg. The barbarian, who was in the front, instantly takes 15 damage and gets dropped down to -1 health. Our damage dealer was instantly brought down by a single swipe. Although we wanted to run, we also didn't want to let a first time player be instantly murdered his first round of combat, so we geared up for a fight. After that surprise round, the ranger shoots and misses the bug. Said bug then runs up to the ranger, everyone else having made terrible rolls for initiative. Jake goes next, and attempts to punch the Ankheg- no effect. Damn. The sorcerer attempt to hit the beastie with a Magic Missle, but the damn ant is too powerful to be hit like that. Next round, the ranger swings with his rapier and hits, granting him the achievement of being the first person able to hit the abomination. The Ankheg then misses the Ranger, the sorcerer then fails to do anything. This makes it Jake's time to shine.\n\n&gt;Jake is somewhat upset about not being able to hit the Ankheg previously and being generally useless.\n\n&gt;Decides to assist the Ranger\n\n&gt;Attempts to kick the Ankheg in a way so that the Ankheg is again stabbed by the Ranger's rapier\n\n&gt;Makes a roll\n\n&gt;20\n\n&gt;Ranger rolls for confirmation, as it's his blade\n\n&gt;19\n\nBoth Jake and the Ranger end up doing about 15 damage to it- not too bad for first level characters.\n\nThis makes it the Ankheg's turn. The Ankheg is pissed, and vents his anger by IMMEDIATELY BISECTING THE RANGER. This culminates in ANOTHER ANKHEG joining the battle and heading straight for me. Jake is feeling like he's going to become have the personal experience of being in a TPK, so he decides to bug out... or he would, if the other Ankheg wasn't there. Jake has the unfortunate dilemma of either being killed by two separate attacks of opportunity or fighting and being killed by two regular attacks. Jake then decides to take a third option.\n\n&gt;Jake wants out\n\n&gt;The first Ankheg is still partially turned around, meaning that it can't attack him via an opportunity strike\n\n&gt;Jake decides to jump on it\n\n&gt;I need to make a Jump roll\n\n&gt;17\n\nJake somehow manages to leap onto the Ankheg as its turning to face him, AND THE SECOND ANKHEG MISSES HIS OPPURTUNITY ATTACK. \n\n&gt;To run to the front of the bug, I need to make a balance check\n\n&gt;16 total\n\nJake manages to ride along the monster despite it flailing about, trying to get the monk off of its hide\n\n&gt;Jake makes it to its head\n\n&gt;Damage roll for kicking the head\n\n&gt;20!\n\n&gt;Confirm crit?\n\n&gt;2\n\n&gt;Dammit\n\nJake manages a solid blow on the Ankheg, dealing 3 damage. Meh.\n\n&gt;Second jump check time\n\n&gt;8\n\nThe Ankheg rears its head and bucks, sending Jake fairly high into the air. It doesn't look good for poor Jake.\n\n&gt;Wait, I can tumble!\n\n&gt;12\n\nJake barely manages to right himself, but he makes it and avoids falling prone. Then the DM rules that that action counted as my *first* move. Thank you based DM. My final action? Running the fuck away, screaming \"FUCKING RUN!!!\" to the sorcerer, who is sadly unable as the second Ankheg runs to him and takes him down to the negative health levels. \n\nAnd that's how Jake Monsoon, Combat Lawyer, was able to run away from an Ankheg encounter.\n",

        "text": "Keeping a Journal for my character. If anyone is that interested in this, I can keep doing it as we have sessions.\n\nI attempt to commit this from memory to word rather quickly. The last two weeks have been hectic to say the least. It started normal, really. I walked my usual walks, and met with the salesman who sold the small novels I wrote. He had an unusual proposition, starting a chain of events that would set my week on it's chaotic path. Someone enjoyed one of my books so much they wanted to commission a special copy with gold leaf paper. After haggling the price, and being generous with the finder's fee, I agreed to give him a 60/40 split of 1000 gold. I was to return in a few days to pick up the book, and hand deliver it with an autograph.\n\nI enjoyed a small amount of fame, but had never received anything like this. In my spare time waiting for the commissioned work to finish, I mostly walked. I hadn't found much success with writing lately, so I had turned to other sources of revenue. I had met a man, who had noticed my observational abilities, deductive reasoning, and keen mind, and had asked me to look out for magical trinkets, artifacts, people heavily laden with coin and to report these characters to him. However, I was unable to locate any such targets and returned to Jamund's (my erstwhile merchant), to pick up the book. He tried unsuccessfully to re-haggle the price and made jokes about bodily harm.\n\nBook in pack, and cane in hand, I set out on my journey across the town to deliver the book in a very busy inn. I quickly made contact with the man, a young elf who was exceptionally excited to meet me. I must confess though that there was something in his eyes that made me uncomfortable, and I kept the conversation succinct but polite. I autographed the front page and he passed me the money. To my dismay, this charlatan, this deceiver tried to pay me with coppers. He had even taken the time to apply an adhesive to them so they'd weigh more.\n\nTired of this time wasting, I left. I tore out the front page and handed it to him, seeing this as enough for a bag of copper, and I left. the next day I would return to Jamund, and would be astounded by the way he threatened me to receive his \"share\" of the 1000 gold that didn't exist. He also said he would be unable to sell the book. I urged him to not pursue this line of thought, but he did not listen.\n\nHe gave me a week to pay. I instead went to my contact in the thieve's guild who paid me to look for hits. I also paid them for insurance, and believe that my contact and I were at least fond of each other. I kept it brief. I wanted him to stop Jamund, and I'd pay. He said he'd need two days to talk it over, and with that, I left.\n\nThe next two days proved more profitable, as I went on my walks, I saw a most peculiar thing. A man walked out of a bakery run by a half-orc just minutes to close. He was pocketing something, and was walking in a hurry. Out of the corner of my eye I could see men on a roof top shadowing him. I would follow this man until I reached the limit of the suburbs into the slums. On a normal day I might have, but not at night to a man with a tail.\n\nWhen I returned to the inn of my contact, I told him about this information and his eyes lit up. He said he was very interested, and that he would handle the merchant, as long as I went with them. The terms seemed fair, and we went on our way. When we confronted Jamund, I asked him one final time to reconsider, but he refused, drawing and firing on us, killing a man. He then made his escape out of the tent.\n\nI paid my contact for his attempt, and went home, thinking I had been private enough in my life that no one would know of it, but I was wrong. As I opened the door, I was struck from behind by the round of a gun. It surprised me, but the harm was minimal, and I made my way inside and got my crossbow. Unsurprisingly, Jamund was unwilling to quit, and used Alchemist's fire to set my home ablaze, a joke not lost on me as an amateur alchemist.\n\nThe halfling had made his way towards the door when I was getting my crossbow, and we exchanged fire from less than 30 feet. He was hellbent on using his guns, which gave me a small window of opportunity. I dropped my crossbow and picked up my mace. I had never used it before on a living target, nor the crossbow. But that was a night of firsts. I charged the Halfling and struck him a mighty blow with the mace. He had managed to load and stepped back to fire. One gun fizzled out, and I twisted like a snake to avoid the other. The man, this snake, this swindle, who had joked about harming me so many times looked up at me with fear in his eyes. I struck him dead, and still do not regret it.\n\nUpon a quick search of his body before leaving, I found a note about some sort of deal at a sewer. It was signed with a strange symbol. In the morning, I went to meet my contact, asking him about the symbol. He said it was an underground arm's market. They moved product through the sewers and that they were the targets of the guild, as there was much money to be made. He thanked me heavily and set off to ambush the deal.\n\nWhile he was gone, I myself received a note from some drunken dwarf smelling of the sewers. It specified another location, and another deal and urged me to come alone. It told me to leave the guilds out of it. I write this in some wretched hotel across the street. That deal is in 2 days, and I am watching, because knowledge is power. I may have to leave town soon, the Black Noose might be upset from being out of the loop. But that will be alright. I wear my worldly possessions on my back now, and Have mace, will travel.\n",

        "text": "Hello again, imma try to do another one of these things. And I'm only half as drunk as last time. Anywho:\n\nBackground:\nThe tale that follows describes my very first table top game ever. The DM was running a low magic world with me and four other experienced players. It was intended to be serious...\n\nCharacters: \n\nFighter-specialized in swords and crossbows. Well rounded character.\n\nRanger-specialized in stealth and ranged. High precision damage.\n\nPaladin-specialized in shields and axes. Tankier than a Churchill.\n\nMonk-specialized in hands and feet. Grapples all the things.\n\nBard(me)-specialized in singing and the only thing close to a magic user. Only now I've cross classed into rogue, so I could throw rocks and stealthily run away. \n\nStory:\nWhen last we left, I had successfully informed an entire town that [back street was indeed back]( http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3c2o78/dd_35_homebrew_noob_bard_saves_the_day_the_aft/). We continued our adventure into noobing by traveling to a neighboring kingdom.  You see, we had caught wind of a corrupt religious sect gaining major power by brainwashing the population and making the poor  pay absurd fees for religious services. On top of everything else, they enforced strict cultural rules. Some examples being curfews, art censorship, strict rule on what women were and weren't allowed to do (big problem as our paladin was a dwarven woman of the same church they were using to control the kingdom), but above all else, song and dance was considered a sin. And Noob Bard ain't having that shit. \n\nSo, off to the  kingdom we went. Once arrived, we had the minor problem of concealing the paladin, but because your's truly had a high disguise and bluff, we where able to pass off the armor plated and full concealed dwarven paladin as a mustachioed armor plated and full concealed dwarven paladin.\n\nThat out of the way, we set out to start a rebellion. After some shady back ally fuckery lead by the monk for some reason, we had found the under ground rebellion and quickly set about shaping them up to take on this corruption. And by we, I mean the rest of the party. I, Noob Bard, started infiltrating a local academy under the guise of a traveling adventurer. Whilst there I started spreading word of the wonders of the outside world. I told of wonderous parties full of singing, dancing, and loose women. Quickly I became the most popular (38 year old) kid at the academy. I had used my new found rogue skills to sneak in censored arts and manuscript to my fellow students while using my already well established skill as a bard to play music in the most secret places in town.\n\nAfter a few in game months past, the rest of the party had whipped the rebellion into shape and I had started an underground youth movement. It came time to bring this corruption down. My role in all of this as set by my party mates was to spring the signal at next week's public forum to start the revolution. I told them to \"look out for a show the likes of which will be talked about for generations\". They took my word on it and I set off to secretly raid the town armory for a side project.\n\nThe day of the forum arrives, and it's quite a turn out. The set up is two stages across from one another. One for officials and one for public speakers. The whole thing was a ruse to make the population think they had a say in the matters. As it started, I mounted the stage. Looking out, I saw many familiar faces. Such as my party and their 50+ hardened rebel friends. I cleared my throat, and simply said [\"LET'S DANCE!!\"]( http://youtu.be/NqGslEZ5I6c) Assisted by the powers of Major Image, dancing lights, and suggestion (on the guards of course) the 50+ rebels started their mission, aided by the 200+ student population of the local academy armed with the town weapon stash. \n\nThat ladies and gentlemen, is how Noob Bard convinced the youth of an overly religious town that had banned singing and dancing to cut footloose.\n\nUnfortunately, this is the end of Noob Bard's quest, as the group had went it's separate ways after school. However, I have more wild tales to tell from the world of d20 modern if there is interest.",

        "text": "Some people asked for more stories, so here's another one. This is the same campaign and crew as detailed in [this story](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3bnvd3/serenity_role_playing_game_how_a_crew_of_misfits/).\n\n***\n\nOur crew was at the time trying to break into a mansion belonging to a wealthy person. The mansion was built on the edge of a small town that we had visited and promised help to. Our goal was to rescue a hostage and kill someone. These two things of course always go well together.\n\nOur ship approached the outskirts of the town where the mansion was situated and we manage to stop without breaking anything, which for our crew was a miracle. Our captain and the resident psychopath came up with an ingenious plan:\n\nWe would blast the gate and front of the mansion open. What could go wrong?\n\nWe fire our canons, destroying the gate and a large portion of the front of the mansion as well as instantly killing a lot of the guards in the courtyard.\n\nHere our Mad Monk came up with a plan to get the hostage, he would paraglide over from our ship into the room the hostage was in. While he succeeded, he also succeeded in knocking himself unconscious when he tried to get back out so both he and the hostage were now on the ground. The psychopath abseils down on a rope and picks them up and we drop the hostage off to safety. \n\nWe then strafe the mansion firing our canons and completely destroy it, thus achieving our objective of killing a  single guy inside it.\n\nIt is at this point another ship approaches with a view to shoot us down because we just destroyed the mansion without a second thought.\nWe immediately go to man the missile launcher.\n\nSo when someone goes to man the missiles, the problem was not a single one  of us had thought to put any points into this at our character creation so we had to rely on the ships default skills. **(I should point out that in this system every ship has its own skill set, ours was not very high.)**\n\nWhat we didn't anticipate was failing all the rolls we would need to fire a missile correctly, so instead of firing at the ship we managed to miss completely and send a missile streaking down the main street into the middle of the town. The town we were meant to be helping out. These aren't piddly little missiles either; these were Ship-to-ship, massive damage, don't-shoot-them-at-a-town sort of missiles.\n\nSo once the smoke clears we see we've destroyed a significant portion of the town including a nice bar we had all been to. We decided it was in our best interests to flee the town, and planet, before the other ship finished facepalming and actually get after us.\n\nWe never did return to that planet.\n\n***\n\nTl;dr: Shit goes wrong, we flee a planet after blowing up a town.\n\nThanks for reading, let me know if you want more of this or if you want to hear some LotR themed stories.",

        "text": "The other day I finally finished my Dark Heresy campaign with my friends, which had a couple of stories I posted months ago (exams meant we couldn't have a session for two months).\n\nThe Cast\n\nPsycho the Psyker - A Emperor loving madman hooked on killing every single boss in a single shot. His player is also extremely knowledgeable on 40k lore.\n\nSmiles the 1920s/1930s Noir Cop - A 'smooth talking' arrogant guy who thinks he's the coolest guy in town. By now he has unknowingly befriended numerous heretics (and has even slept with one)\n\nCynic the Gunslinger - Most competent and sanest member of the entire group, often dispatching enemies with ease.\n\nBy now the group have successfully infiltrated the local military and political scene, identifying several cultists worshipping either Khorne or Slaanesh. After attempting an arrest of a Colonel, they are betrayed and it is revealed there is a third cult on the planet, worshipping Tzeentch. By now my three friends want to kill me.\n\nAnyway, more 'intelligent' and 'highly impressive' investigations continue, where they get more and more liberal wit the use of their Inquisition insignia. This can do good, like win over 250 Arbites, or bad, like reveal it to a cultist who makes sure no pleas for help reach their Inquisitor.\n\nThey receive information that the Slaanesh cult is stationed in an abandoned mine which could be blown up but only from within. The three head up with Imperial Guard and PDF squads. Due to it being in a mine, they take free moving (as in not on tracks) mine carts to travel deeper. A week before the session we had all gone to watch Mad Max.\n\nSoon enough, cultists were chasing their group with their own, custom mine carts. It was meant to be epic, but Cynic (as ever) got lucky with his rolls and wrecked a few carts, causing a pile up.\n\nThey carried on in peace until I revealed my master card: A massive, monstrous mine cart. As big as four mine carts but together, it crushed their escort and had metal jaws of death on the front. Now all thats left is the player's cart and a cart carrying the bomb. They fight off an initial wave of cultists, but their driver is stabbed in the action, causing Smiles to take the wheel. Cynic summed it up perfectly.\n\n\"Should we just jump off now, to save us time?\"\n\nTo make matters worse, Psycho's rival showed up. This was a politician he had choked in the past, and was revealed as a cultist. He too was a psyker and he wielded a chaos katana (Psycho's player hates what he calls 'weeaboo bullshit').\n\nThe fight goes ok, until I make Smiles roll a driving test.\n\nHe fails miserably.\n\nSo I make my boss roll an agility test. He passes. So both Cynic and Psycho roll to stay on.\n\nThey fail miserably.\n\nTo my player's horror, their characters get thrown off the cart and towards the death cart of death. I give them both another agility check to try and jump onto the cart.\n\nThey fail miserably.\n\nNow I make them roll strength to pull themselves up and avoid getting eaten by the jaws of death. Cynic rolls and passes. Psycho rolls.\n\nHe fails miserably.\n\nSo one of my players is driving a cart with his only passenger wanting to kill him, one is on a cart with half a dozen cultists and the third one is getting chewed on by a chaos mine cart.\n\nI'm a great GM.\n\nThankfully both Cynic and Psycho manage to get onto their cart after blowing up the death cart with grenades. But guess what? Smiles fails to drive again, throwing off Cynic into a FLAMING death cart of death. Psycho stays on and has an epic fight with his rival. But he's outmatched in both psychic powers and swordsmanship. So he takes a leaf out of my book.\n\nHe throws the boss into the flaming death cart.",

        "author": "Brendsmalls",
        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3cd2ty/dd_35_tales_of_the_worst_game_ive_played_in/",
        "text": "(Cross post from /DnD, thought you guys would enjoy)\n\nhttps://m.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/3cckhl/tales_of_the_worst_game_ive_played_in/\n\nThis is the story of the best character I've ever played in the worst campaign I've ever played in. Setting is 3.5, 2nd level, and I'm joining in on a game that's already been going for a few sessions. GM is very new, and has decided to set the game in he world of Equestria despite nothing in the game being remotely pony related. Active players are a pair of Bronies who carpool over and GM's room mate who is very new to role playing and the only other non-Brony aside from myself. I'm not expecting any super heavy hack and slash number combat so I pick a race and class I've always wanted to play but never did.\n\nI made Tippy. Tippy is a Chaotic Good Kenku (small crow men who can mimic speech, glide badly, and aid another slightly better) and a bard. My choice of class immediately draws the ire of the more DnD experienced Brony, who I can already tell is the worst kind of Aspie that gives players (and Bronies) a bad name, considering the other one is just a cool dude who happens to like MLP. Tippy grew up on heroic tales of mighty and brave warriors, and has travelled the land a filthy, often inebriated (hence the nickname) minstrel, seeking to follow and chronicle the adventures of worthy heroes. He dresses in a rainbow assortment of different clothing sewn together into one raggedy outfit and I speak all their lines in a bubbly singsong manner like I'm in my own musical.\n\nThe rest of the party is a Dwarven fighter played by the newbie room mate (your stereotype gruff but good hearted Dwarven warrior) who I'll call Gruffy, an Elf Wizard played by Goodbrony, and a nearly chaotic evil doppleganger Psion played by Aspie. I am quickly realizing that the DM does not know enough about the system to rein in Aspie, who is a shameless munchkin with a homebrewed race/class combo that lets him shapeshift at will perfectly and read minds (with no ECL). Tippy loves helping people, and has a mischievous streak that he expresses by mimicking the voices of those that annoy him back in a mocking falsetto version. This habit delights Gruffy, Goodbrony, and GM to no end as they are clearly eager to roleplay with someone new. Aspie is not amused in  the least.\n\nA goblin army to the south is planning an invasion, although from what I can gather the sessions I've missed have consisted of Aspie's character murdering and assuming the identity of an Elf nobleman while the party goes along and squats in his mansion. Radical. \n\nWe decide to help foil the invasion plan by waltzing straight into the goblin siege camp, something our DM clearly didn't think we'd do. After the BBEG teleports away and let's us ransack his private chambers inside his evil tower, we decide to spare a random troll named (who the DM quickly names Hovelgarr), and I immediately accept him as not only someone who can carry our shit for us but a full fledged member of the game (Tippy is naive to human civilized customs, as trolls are considered vermin at best). I keep trying to cheer Hovelgarr up by singing him songs in my usual \"I see a smiiiiile\" kind of pep talk attitude as we return to town, the goblin threat dissipated (I guess the rest of the goblin siege just left? It was never mentioned again).\n\nWe get Hovelgarr set up in the mansion basement/Aspie's torture dungeon while Aspie does more evil elsewhere, and Tippy figures that if Trolls eat people and Hovelgarr is hungry, the best solution is to buy a handcart and haggle with a mortician for some dead bodies (since they'll at least do some good this way). I proceed to wheel them back the mansion and am predictably stopped by guards for being suspicious as hell. I naively tell them that the bodies are for my troll friend the Elf noble let stay in his mansion. The guards are dumbstruck. Gruffy and Goodbrony are laughing their asses off. Aspie is turning red and announces to the DM that his character (still in the form of the noble) decides to head back to the mansion as the guards let me pass and start keeping an eye on the place.\n\nAs he basically runs to the mansion, I'm using my ranks in craft cooking to make a stew for Hovelgarr and we're having a great time role playing a moral debate with me trying to convince Gruffy that eating stew isn't evil, even if it's people, as Hovelgarr chows down and I have a bit (it was tasty). Aspie, meanwhile, is awkwardly trying to talk his way past the guards who grill him at his doorstep, especially after he admits to letting a clearly deranged Kenku and a Troll stay there. After the session Aspie cajoles Goodbrony to drive him home immediately as we all hang out after the game.\n\nNext session, DM has come up with half baked arena event, where we can fight or watch. I quickly realize that DM is dead set on turning his otherwise serious game into a joke with NPC's named Weedle (a monstrous version of the Pokemon) and, I shit you not, a knife wielder named Poontang McChicken (the DM is in early twenties, but writes his prep stoned). \n\nAspie has come to the table with a vengeance. He has made a new broken homebrew fighter-type that can somehow blink at will and use this to catch people flat footed after convincing DM that constitutes surprise. The character is such a cookie cutter \"lone, misunderstood sword master\" that they might as well be named Edgelord McKenshin. DM decides it's a good idea to match them against Gruffy in a round, and we get to watch our beloved comrade get one shotted and then coup de graced. We then have to sit and watch Aspie basically jack off IC as they defeat more npcs and win the tournament. They leave the arena with the prize money and a giant grin, expecting to seamlessly transition into our group despite murdering Gruffy. They have gone too far. Even Goodbrony, who drives him here, is resisting now. As we berate their character for Gruffy's death, they decide now is a good time to show how badass they are by acting like death doesn't phase them. I roll initiative. I'm still just a nearly helpless bard, but gods be praised they rolled for shit. I cast sleep. They fail their save, hard. Goodbrony relieves them of their prize money as I convince the growing crowd of concerned onlookers that they fainted and need medical help. Everyone is nearly falling out of their chairs at the situation except Aspie, who is turning beet red.\n\nWe head back to the mansion, where we meet Gruffy's new character, and Aspie wakes up and makes a bee line to the mansion, despite having no in game knowledge of it or us being there. Cool. They show up, hellbent on killing me, and I have to hide in the graveyard of the mansion on top of a mausoleum. Aspie is searching for me furiously while the party tells them they don't want it to come to violence, and we end in a Mexican standoff where they realize that if they kill me, Hovelgarr is going to pull their spine out of their ass. We're basically unwilling to end the situation by outright killing a fellow player, something Aspie has no scruples about, since the session came to an uncomfortable end as they killed Gruffy's new character and fled.\n\nThe fallout and bad feelings pretty much killed the campaign as well, but the shame was that the otherwise awesome Goodbrony was codependent enough to be socially attached to Aspie at the hip so if we wanted one we got the other. The campaign was one of those rare gems where most of the party had a blast just shooting the shit in character and dreaded combat where the munchkin hogged the spotlight, which ended up being a poor mix with a DM who wasn't self assured enough to stand up to a toxic player.\n\nThanks for reading, I hope you enjoyed it. If you have a story about a toxic player, please share.",

        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3cb6ss/l5r_young_herons/",
        "text": "We're playing Legend of the Five Rings currently. The premise is that a crotchety old Magistrate of the Pheonix Clan by the name of **Asawi Mensobara** has holed himself up in the mountains and takes in young Samurai of all the great clans (selected by him from afar) for a year of... Social Interaction and occasional tasks seeing them sent outside his 'Young Heron Court.'\n\nOur characters are three of his Young Herons, who's names are easily forgotten by me, because I am not Japanese nor have I ever expressed wish to be (and given Rokugan's Honour System, I consider myself justified in this.)\n\nAnd so, the Player Characters, as best as I can describe it.\n\n* **Kakita Masumi,** of the Crane Clan, an excellent duelist and utterly fastidious to the point of compulsion. (Read: Took the negative trait 'Compulsion: Tidyness'.)\n\n* **Moto Anahita,** of the Unicorn Clan, who has a prized posession, an Utaku steed (Imagine a Western Warhorse put next to a pony, which is what a normal Rokugan Horse is.)\n\n* **Bayushi Masaru,** of the Scorpion Clan, somewhat estranged from his family.\n\nFor those unaware, L5R (Legend of the Five Rings) is Fantasy Feudal Japan on Steriods. All our Characters are members of the Samurai Class. There are three vague Character types in L5R:\n\n* Bushi, straight up Warriors, who are the only type to carry the full Diasho (In L5R, it's a matched Katana and Wakizashi.)\n\n* Shugenja, who are basically Mages who cast spells through prayers and incantations to the Kami (essentially natural spirits of the five Rings: Water, Fire, Earth, Air, Void)\n\n* Courtiers, who are social focused Character. Social is a big thing in L5R.\n\n---\n\nSo far, we have been on on two missions for him, and a few things become apparent:\n\n* He lies. He directs us where he wants us to go, but the actual reason why is very much hidden from us. He does this to *everyone* not just us.\n\n* Whenever we return from one of his mission, he asks us extremely probing questions which there are no correct answers to, or sets us challenging little riddles playing with our Particular Clan identity.\n\nFor example, he would ask my Character, Masaru, the Scoprion, a Clan renowned for their low, dishonourable and cunning nature, to tell me a lie which is also the truth. He would ask Masumi to cut a strip of cloth with her Katana without drawing it. That sort of (really, arseholish) thing.\n\nOur second mission had been escorting a woman to the Young Heron Court, for reasons initially not disclosed to us. These reasons soon became apparent when a pair of Monster-Hunters attacked us. The woman was a Naga, extremely skilled in Healing Magic. Having safely escorted her to our master, she worked her (literal) magic on him, and he returned to his normal self.\n\n**Much to our dismay.**\n\nHe's fully aware of his privileged position, both as our Stand-In Daimyo and as a standing Magistrate of the Empire. He is both A) Our Direct Superior and B) His authority is second only to the Emperor.\n\nHe abuses this *relentlessly* how he has the strength to do so. The probing questions have expanded their reach, and one by one, the young Herons have been singled out and asked probing questions once again.\n\nSometimes with the most unfortunate of timings. For example, he approached Masumi in the Bathhouse (usually Gender Segregated, but he's a Magistrate and your direct Superior. You can't do anything about it.) In one particular instance, he approached a Female Lion Bushi by the name of **Matsu Ryumko** (whom is known to the party, and prone to quarrelling with Anahita) whilst she was getting dressed in the morning. Then asked if he could have her Kimono to as a gift to someone.\n\nThis is a person you cannot say *no* to. Or, at the very least, not with the Social Skills Ryumko possessed. And so, our master left, Kimono in hand, Ryumko practically squawking in outrage behind hi,. (Lions are somewhat known for their directness.)\n\nRyumko has taken umbrage with this, and has since taken to not wearing Kimonos at all, instead settling for the female (Rokugan) equivalent of trousers and bare chest.\n\nAnd then, once all his Young Herons and been thus interrogated (and in some cases, mightily offended,) he sent a large number (1/4 - 1/3) back to their clans in disgrace, (The disgrace being that they were sent back to their clans.) This is something that has never happened before, or least in such numbers.\n\nPurge complete, he begins sending the remainder off on tasks, until but five Young Herons remain at the Court.\n\n* The Party Characters\n* The Aforementioned Ryumko.\n* **Kakita Misato**, also of the Crane Clan, and a family member to our own who I (player) unfairly nick-named 'Ditzy', but a more accurate description would be that she sees great beauty in most things, and will therefore get lost in contemplation at the slightest touch. But hardly a bimbo.\n\nDuring a meal (in an incredibly empty-looking hall) Mensobara, our Master offhandly informs us that he has load of excellent Sake being delivered, and that he wants us out of the way while he enjoys it. (In Rokugan, it's considered extremely stupid to drink in Company, because of the risk you get drunk and do something dishonourable whilst not being able to correct yourself.)\n\nSo he tells us to go to an abandoned *Kyuden* (fortress) in mountainous territory of the Dragon Clan (one of the Great Clans) because there has been 'movement' there. The Fortress, it must be noted, was abandoned after the Succession Wars that ended 150ish years ago, that was started with the entire Imperial Family wiped out in a Night.\n\nThe movement, Mensobara intones, is likely banditry, as the local Henian (peasents) have been suffering from plague and the Dragon Clan has done nothing to aid them. The Dragon Clan are notoriously devout and Ascetic. There response to the Plague amongst their Henian is *'You're not worth the medicine. Consider it a Spiritual challenge. Do well, and maybe you're be re-born as a not-peasant.'*\n\nHowever, as we're travelling outside of Phoenix Lands, and will need some proof of his authority, he gives us his Seal. He notes he only has the one.\n\nSo task in hand, we set off (with adequate supplies and cold weather gear, which sends our Masumi into a fit because they are not beautiful enough), our Unicorn riding her mighty steed and the rest of us borrowing Rokugan Ponies.\n\nIt takes us two weeks to reach the last village before the Mountains themselves. Off the suggestion of Anahita, we acquire a local Henian (peasant) as a guide, who informs that a Blizzard will soon strike the mountains, which will be the death of the Ponies, although not the Utaku, should we be caught in it.\n\nAfter some debate, we decide to leave the Ponies with the villagers, and press on with ourselves and the Otaku, rather than wait the Blizzard out in the village.\n\nFive days into our trek, the Fortress is in sight, and most certainly not abandoned. This is fortunate, because the Blizzard hits us. On the advice of our guide, we press on.\n\nWe get to the base of the Castle, guards absent from the walls, the gates barred and shut. Anahita, sick and tired off all this, hammers on the door. It's a minute before he get a reply and the conversation goes like this (with associated diplomacy rolls):\n\n\"We'd like some hospitality please!\"\n\n\"No! I have orders from my Daimyo to turn away anyone unauthorised, and you're not on the list! You may huddle against the Walls if you wish!\"\n\n\"No! We travel on a Magistrate's business!\"\n\n*15 Minute Wait. This is a long time in a Blizzard.*\n\n\"We can throw supplies over the walls, but that is the best I can offer!\"\n\n\"And risk letting us freeze to death? That is unacceptable and you know it!\" (backed by a better diplomacy Roll, as provided by our Crane Companion rather than our Unicorn Companion.)\n\n\"Which Magistrate?\"\n\n\"Asawi Mensobara!\"\n\n*40 Minute wait. This is a longer time in a Blizzard.*\n\n\"...Fine!\"\n\nWe are let through a Postern Gate, into a Courtyard (including the horse. It is a tight fit. Our Guide, seeing the number of armed/armoured Samurai, takes his chances elsewhere.)  Or at least a section of the Courtyard covered by an awning, surrounded by armed, armoured Dragon Clan (various families within the Dragon Clan itself) Samurai.\n\nWe are informed by the Garrison Commander, a man by the name of **Tamori Satsuman** that we may stay under this awning but stray no further, and that only on Masumi revealing Mensobara's Seal, and that he has already sullied his honour by allowing us access, against his Daimyo's direct orders. (This is one of the great difficulties of an Honour System like Rokugan's: There are many situations where your are doomed either way.)\n\nWhen then reveal that our Magistrate's business was to investigate this Kyuden in particular. You can see Satsuman's life begin to collapse behind his eyes as he, through a mouthful of gravel (like gritted teeth, but the entire mouth,)  offers us rooms in the Kyuden itself (In Western terms, the Keep in a tower or something.)\n\nDuring afternoon and breakfast conversations with Satsuman, and observations of our quarters, we notice and wheedle out of the Garrison Commander the following:\n\n* The Kyuden, or at least it's interior, is decorated far too sumptuously for the tastes of Satsuman and, more curiously, he has orders from on high to not change them.\n* The Decorations, as may be noted, are all Histories of the Empire and it's great things and works. There is something we're not quite getting about them, but the GM won't tell us, because we're meant to figure it out for ourselves.\n* That it's 'purpose' has remained unchanged since it's foundation, 250 years ago.\n* In a flash of inspiration, Our Crane Friend (The PC) asks 'How long has this place been a Dojo?' The light behind the Garrison Commander's eyes dims further as he informs us that this is not a Dojo, as there is only one pupil.\n* And that that pupil is named Hanita. Note the lack of Clan or family name.\n\nAfter breakfast, we resolve to go out into the Castle and explore somewhat. Ryumko goes to the Barracks to do what she does best (provoke,) our Anahita and Misato (the Crane NPC) go off so Anahita can play her flute in a Garden (cunning designed that it is warm enough to not kill the plants even in a Blizzard) and Masaru and Misumi go off in another direction.\n\nThe GM resolves the Masaru and Misumi first, running into an old Samurai whom has been teaching the young Hanita (he easily confides in us that he thinks she's a bastard.) He confides that he has been teaching her... Well, in conjunction with other tutors, everything. Including, he notes with some frustration, a very Dragon view of the world, which she has refused to accept. Asides from that, he notes, she is an excellent student: Intelligent, Knowledgeable, inquisitive.\n\nIt is a good thing that she questions, because this old man sees this Dragon view as a self-evident truth. And it is a militant one, viewing some of the greatest Emperors of the Empire as hopelessly lost to decadence. He believes that the Empire would be made into harmony if all followed the Dragon way. (And he talking here to a Crane and a Scorpion, clans which couldn't view that as further from the truth.)\n\nMeanwhile, the flute-playing of Anahita has attracted Hanita herself. It's the first music she's heard in years, she confides to them. She's excitable, and foroging long-taught rules of formality and etiquette both because of her excitement, and the fact that she remains a child, not having gone through the ceremonies that moves one to Adulthood.\n\nIt should be noted that Hanita, whilst holding no family name whatsoever (and confiding in us that her tutors are hiding something from her as to why she's kept here) she's is dressed in sumptuous clothes, reserved for... Well, people far above us in station. We're not quite sure where above us: We've never seen an example.\n\nPhysically, she is a beautiful girl of age 16-17.\n\nEventually, Hanita asks if Anahita has, as a woman of the Unicorn Clan, a Utaku Steed. Hanita excitedly asks if she can see it? She's rather hard to dislike at this point, and of course, they say yes.\n\n[*A few moments later...*](http://img4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20100409181506/spongebob/images/thumb/a/a2/A_Few_Moments_Later.jpg/1280px-A_Few_Moments_Later.jpg)\n\nThe tutor we've been talking to notes that it's past the time that he took the young Hanita for lessons. He asks a passing Samurai if he knows her location.\n\n\"The Courtyard.\" The Gritted teeth tells us who's company she's in. We're going to be honest: They're aresholes! We enjoy their discomfort immensely.\n\nMore so when he walks into the Courtyard (us trailing him, to get our first look at Hanita) to the site of Hanita and Anahita on her Utaku Steed. Doing a jump. Over a suitably low object.\n\nWhy, the tutor almost had an aneurysm! It was great!\n\nHanita is hurriedly called away from lessons, and the GM calls for a Void Roll.\n\nVoid is one of the Character Starts (In D&amp;D terms, Strength, Dexterity, Constitution etc.) Void isn't really physical or mental. It's... Divine Spark. Epiphany. You can use it in the Game similar to Edge in Shadowrun.\n\nThe GM calls for a Void Roll, and only Masaru passes. And stops dead in his tracks struck by a beautiful and terrifying epiphany, which explains so much, but he would rather that it didn't. So he tries to get Hanita off the horse with urgency, more, even, than her tutor.\n\nHurriedly, hegathers the party together in private and speaks.\n\n\"Hanita... She has... There are certain facial and... With what we have seen and discussed It's plausible, very plausible...\" Ryumko snarled at him to get on with it. \"Imperial family. Original Imperial Family. The one thought lost at the beginning of the succession wars.\"\n\nThis sparks an argument. An HOURS-LONG argument. It was great. We realised that the probing questions that our master had asked us before sending many home; The nature of Honour and Dishonour, The nature of the Divine Mandate the Empire holds. He asked Rumiko, the Lion, who's wholeheartedly backed the new Bloodline, on the nature of past mistakes.\n\nOur Master knew. Somehow he knew, and he trusted us to act in his name, with his seal in hand.\n\nFinally, finally, we acted.\n\nMisato, carrying our Anahita's Katana (as she fights with a *gaijn* Scimitar,) in addition to her own, goes off to stay at Hinata's side (the spare Katana is for Hinata, should she require of demand it.) The rest of us go to demand answers of the Garrison Commander in his office.\n\nAfter formalities, we go to the meat of it.\n\n\"Tell us of Hanita's heritage.\"\n\nAt this, he unveils a scroll, and rolls out across the desk. It is an order, marked with the Seal of the Dragon Clan.\n\n---\n&gt;The Garrison Commander shall commit Seppuku if he fails in his duties.\n---\n\nWell then. Guess we're on the right track.\n\n**Continued in the comments.**",

        "text": "So if you read my post two weeks ago you read about our unfortunate luck with this Pugwampis and the cathedral. I had to miss last nights session due to my parents coming in from out of town whom I'm lucky to see three or four times a year. The DM calls me last night and begins his story with \"you are going to be so sorry that you missed this\"\n\nSo (recap) our groups is playing through the Pathfinder canned adventure Legacy of Fire (there's likely to be some spoilers so if your reading this and are going to play this adventure it best to cover your eye holes). Our stalwart group is made up of Garrus the fighter who speaks in third person, Panda Jones our resident Wonder Druid (he heals, he tanks, he does great dps, and he even makes water before your very eyes!) Brandon our half gene monk (who is self described as a half naked black man) and Ryan our dwarves gunslinger and all around most useful character ever.\n\nSo Garrus and Panda Jones skipped this particular session due to family and sleep and what not so Brandon agreed to co play us through with the help of the DM. So our antics last time attracted the attention of the Pugwampi boss who was hiding and between the four adventurers they managed to defeat him (this part was paraphrased in order to get to the crazy shit that happened later) after he tried to break my shield and we smashed his nuts up into his tits.\n\nSo then, the brave adventurers begin to explore the cathedral which they must make safe for the caravan to use as a base camp. So they find a garden that's gone to riot. Nothing unusual there so they move on and find a giant refuse heap with GARGOYLES along the top of it. \n\nAt this point the DM's dog, Fredrick Neichze, requires a potty break and while being walked the DM misses the greatest player break down ever. Ryan the gunslinger recounted the high points to him upon his return but it boiled down to the monks fears that the gargoyles we're going to kill him and especially him because he was a strong black character trapped in a horror movie style scenario and that would undoubtedly spell his demise. The gunslinger points out that they have a hearty meat shield and a Druid with spells and a bear companion. The monk then goes on a small rant about how he whole heartedly believes that the Druid might be an idiot savant whose bear only exists in his own mind and will quickly cease to exist once he is undoubtedly killed by the gargoyles.\n\nSo the DM comes back and the campaign continues. The gargoyles, however, are a red haring, but the gunslinger shoots a few of them to be sure. Well these shots attracted the attention of cat sized mosquito creatures with huge \"proboscises\". The players heard proboscises and the monk says \"so their giant flying dicks is what your saying\". He then drew one out which was indeed a giant flying penis with balls for wings. The DM didn't even bother to correct them, he was too busy laughing, and so the party was attacked by flying sucks with balls for wings.\n\nGarrus and the Druid get into positions to attack them while the gunslinger begins to shoot them out of the sky and the monk hides while muttering something about not going out like a brutha in a George Romero film. So long story short Garrus is fucked for two points of constitution damage and the Druid is fucked to death by flying penises because the gunslinger didn't want to risk shooting into the middle of them and the monk was busy helping the fighter not to die from being swarmed by flying dicks. \n\nThe Druid was saved by an errant God who took pity on him for dying while trying to help it and thus our band of misfits will live to fight another day.\n\nTLDR: group gets distracted by gargoyles and attached by giant penises ",

        "text": "So, folks, been a while. I've got a new story for you, from a new group (actually, the same group as the Shirt Bandits stories)... but this time, I get to be a player, too! We've been alternating Pathfinder sessions with Star Wars, and it's been quite fun.\n\nIntroductions:\n\nThe Meat: Our dragonrider, joined by his silver dragon \"mount\" (in reality, too small yet to be ridden). Pretty typical meathead character; dumb as a box of rocks but built like one of his grandparents got frisky with a troll. Generally decent-natured, but greedy; he doesn't really \"get\" complex moralistic issues, and prefers that the world boil down to simple things, like \"bad guys,\" \"guys who are paying me to kill bad guys,\" and on one memorable occasion, \"guy who didn't pay me and who is now a bad guy.\" His dragon companion is a bit runty yet, but he's a valued contributor in combat and he tends to help the Meat through thornier mental troubles. Wields a magic flaming warhammer in combat. (In the Shirt Bandits series, he plays the Greasemonkey.) His greatest exploits are generally combat-related, and he has many of them because once a serious combat gets going he's by far the most dangerous of all of us.\n\nThe Zookeeper: Our ranger tends to be among the more moral of the group, especially when it comes to the wilds. He's a mean hand with a bow, but more importantly has been working on taming animals. He has a thoroughly bad-tempered large-cat familiar (a tiger or panther, I believe?) and a tamed blink dog, and between the three of them we have plenty of scouts and quiet-work people. Typically fights with a bow. His greatest exploits have been in his scouting (helping us set ambushes), but he also completely trivialized an early boss fight by nearly critting its head off. (In Shirt Bandits, this is the Furbag.)\n\nThe Summoner: The Summoner is more or less the party face, thanks to his ballin' Charisma score, and takes on a pretty good chunk of the magical duties as well. His wolf eidolon is another valuable member of the combat force, although the Summoner himself is actually rather weak in direct combat beyond having a simple wand of magic missiles. He hasn't had time to make many heroic exploits yet. (Plays the Killbot in the Shirt Bandits stories.)\n\n**STARBRIGHT GOBBLESNATCH, GENTLEMAN ADVENTURER**: This is me. This is what I play when I have a chance to play rather than DM. Starbright Gobblesnatch is a human who was adopted and raised by a (huge) family of gnomes, and he took on a few of their quirks and grew up to be an Artificer. Insufferably eager, geeky, and *easily* distracted by just about anything interesting, magical, or sparkly. He has no eyebrows or hair due to alchemical mishaps, and despite carrying a club, crossbow, and *blunderbuss,* tends to be pretty lackluster in actual combat. In fact, it wasn't until this very session that he made a mark for himself; up till then, his greatest claim to fame has been using smokesticks to blind and distract a giant and the time he dropped a phial of alchemist's fire on his own head.\n\n\n\nWe had carried a letter of recommendation to the local bounty hunter's guild from our previous employer, a well-known \"facilitator\" often hired to source muscle for jobs both clean and dirty. We weren't quite sure how it would be received, but it turned out that the story of how we'd murdered the man who gave it to us tickled our new boss's funny bone; after all, we could hardly be held responsible for what happened after the bastard had stiffed us, especially considering that we were helping with some seriously grimy work that we would have walked away from in a heartbeat if he hadn't kept adding zeroes to the contract.\n\nWe were tasked to hunt up a group of bandits that were harassing travelers in the area. They were unusually well-organized and well-supplied, leading a couple of us to suspect something more severe going on. But subtle people we are not; the Zookeeper and the Meat set off back onto the road to check out a guy we had encountered on our way into the city. The guy had seemed more curious than suspicious, but that didn't last long, and it was only through quick intervention by the Meat that the Zookeeper wasn't killed by the band of ruffians hiding in the back of the scout's wagon. More concerning, though, was what happened next: after the scout party had been dealt with, someone invisible had moved through the area, executing the survivors with some sort of poison. \n\nA straightforward thinker, the Meat hoisted a couple of the corpses onto the wagon and brought them back for Starbright to look over. He quickly identified them as quite dead. Upon being pressed and informed that they'd been poisoned, he was able to identify the poison as something quite unique: a magical prismatic poison, thoroughly deadly and extremely complex.\n\nWe split up, to the libraries, to the Alchemist's Quarter... but it was Starbright who came across the big lead, as he went to the largest university in the area and struck up a conversation with a professor of alchemical science. He was rather taken with her, almost to the point that he forgot to ask about the prismatic poison, but she had to leave in a hurry as she had to travel the very next day.\n\nStarbright, being easily distracted but not stupid, set the Meat's dragon to follow her movements from the sky. The group was able to meet up, gear up, and set off on our own cart to follow hers at a safe distance. We had a hunch that the bandits were capturing alchemists, so we figured that this was our best bet to find them.\n\nThis led us to where our story truly begins. We found their wagon, which had been attacked, but the professor and her brother were nowhere to be found. The Zookeeper and his allies tracked her trail to a bandit camp, and we made short work of the occupants, in the process meeting the Professor's brother, a deadly Magus who implied that this sort of hostage situation was fairly normal for the pair, though it sounded like things had gotten beyond their control. We were able to bribe the location of their main base, plus the existence of a secret tunnel, out of one of the survivors... well, the only survivor, really, since the only other person to survive the fighting didn't really live long under the brother's eager and insistent interrogation.\n\nThe brother had a name, I swear. But his real name will always and forever be Christian Bale, because his catchphrase immediately became \"WHERE IS SHE!?\" We're a terrible group, mixing in Batman references rather than Monty Python.\n\nIn any case, we made it to the camp without much trouble. The tunnel led right under some sort of storage area, and we made it there in the dead of night. Very useful.\n\nIt was at this point we encountered our first obstruction, a trapdoor. Normally locks are not a problem; Starbright had a minor fascination with them, and not many locks could stand up to his eager work with his collection of lucky lockpicks. The alarm spell on the trapdoor, on the other hand, was a much thornier issue. We knew that even touching the trapdoor would either magically alert the caster or sound an alarm, and neither was something we wanted to deal with.\n\nStarbright came up with a very simple and straightforward solution. Rather than dealing with the alarmed trapdoor, he simply cast a Silence spell on the Meat and had him bash through the floor. We'd been relatively certain nobody was in that room, after all, and this was a simple and guaranteed way to remove the problem. And so it did.\n\nWe emerged from a storeroom. The Zookeeper went first, and found himself in a dingy little bar. A few of the thugs drinking there took offense to his entrance, but Bale and the Zookeeper were able to rapidly mop them up. The Meat chucked the bodies down the hole we'd broken, and we dove back into the storeroom while the Zookeeper, Bale, and the bartender tried to bluff the guards who came to investigate the sound.\n\nThe barkeep immediately earned his new nickname, as well as an invite back to our place to be our personal bartender: he is now known as Scruffy the Bartender. He managed to completely deadpan his way through explaining away the noise, and got the guards to go away without a fight.\n\nWordlessly, once they were gone, the Zookeeper replaced the tip we'd put on the counter to by his silence with a neat stack of gold.\n\nWe searched the tavern. It looked like it was the ground floor of a larger building; we rapidly determined that the upper floors probably contained the leader or possibly the lab of the alchemist who was brewing the prismatic poison. We wanted none of that; Bale was insistent that any plan begin with finding the prisoners. We had a good idea where they were; there were only three buildings in the compound, and one of them was very obviously a barracks. The third was a house or storeroom.\n\nFinally, we found the thing that really started our plan going... three large barrels of black powder. The Zookeeper groaned (as it meant we were facing musketmen), the Summoner got a bad feeling, and Starbright immediately started devising ways to put such a princely haul to good use. A quick Ant Haul spell on the Meat, and he had this big eighty-pound barrel up on his back like it was nothing at all.\n\nSneaking across the yard with a guy in heavy armor, three guys with zero stealth training between them, and an eighty-pound barrel of boom might have presented a problem, but we saw little reason to quit with something that was working so well; another Silence spell to cover the sound once the scouts said that the guards were away, and we sprinted across that yard, ending up behind the house. We made our entry through the back door. Of course, this was complicated slightly by the fact that there was no back door, but we dealt with this the same way we deal with most of our problems: throw the Meat at it and go in after the screaming stops. He hit that wall like it had insulted his mother just before the Silence spell wore off, very nearly managing to go full Kool-Aid Man without actually making a sound.\n\nWhile he recovered, Bale and the Zookeeper slipped in through the hole. One of them made a sound to draw the guards, so they dealt with them as quickly and efficiently as a ranger and a pissed-off magus can manage. The remaining guards in the house, as well as the lanterns out front, were put out by the Meat's dragon's frost breath.\n\nSearching the house revealed the prisoners to be largely accounted for. Plenty of captured alchemists, including the Professor. She was fine, though many of the others were the worse for wear. But we didn't have time to coddle them. A trio of the musket men had noticed that the lanterns on the house were out and were coming to investigate.\n\nBale and the Professor helped coax the prisoners able to walk into getting through the back and out of the way. Those unable to walk were simply strapped onto the Meat's back, as with the lingering effects of Starbright's Ant Haul spell the Meat could carry well over a half-ton for at least a short time.\n\nMeanwhile, Starbright was rigging a tripwire to the door of the house. Connected to the tripwire, by means of clever engineering, was a phial of alchemist's fire... suspended directly over the barrel of gunpowder we'd brought over with us. He finished his trap and left the house just before the musketmen opened the front door, at which point the door, the musketmen, and most of the house ceased to exist.\n\nIn the confusion, the group sprinted back for the main building, with someone having to stop to drag Starbright part of the way to keep him from staring at the explosion for too long. We made it to the main building's back door as the guards turned out in force to investigate why a third of their base was now a smoking crater.\n\nAn evil plan formed.\n\nThe Meat quickly became the recipient of a Bull's Strength spell, pushing his normally-heroic strength to biblical proportions. Another barrel of our precious powder was loaded onto his back as the guards shouted in confusion.\n\nIn the dark night, they didn't see him getting a run up. Maybe a few of them saw him lob that barrel. The barrel's perfect parabolic arc and subsequent landing in the still-flaming wreckage of the first blast, however, was actually the last thing most of them saw; a second explosion shook the night, reducing the damaged house to kindling and reducing the lion's share of the guard force to... well, not much at all.\n\nThe Zookeeper mopped up the survivors rapidly with his bow, and we started to regroup and prepare for the next step: hunting down the bandit leader and his alchemist lackey, since none of the captured alchemists had been responsible for the prismatic poison. Meanwhile, Bale was leading the alchemists down our escape tunnel.\n\nThe good news was, we didn't have to look for the bandit leader long. The bad news was, he found us, and announced himself by putting a pair of crossbow bolts through the Meat's armor.\n\n\nTo be continued...",

Your humble narrator.\n\n**Ara &amp; Tomas**, twins. Ara has the talent of possession, and can force certain actions if her magic is not successfully resisted. Tomas has the power to raise the dead, or to summon skeletons and animate them using the pervasive death-energy that lies just beneath the world.\n\n**Grimnir**, a skald.\n\n**Erikki**, a devotee of Ratatosk.\n\n**Clansig Toothbeard**, a blood wolf.\n\n**The Lady in the Water**, a mermaid, in the same way that feral jackals are 'dogs.'\n____\nOur party has met at an abandoned longhouse several days ago and decided, against all odds, that the never-ending Fimbulwinter is actually worse than each others company. Having together fended off the attack of a handful of giant wolves, at least one of whom was a deserter from Managarm's army that is besieging the Aeser. In the basement of the longhouse, we found an altar to a sea goddess who was depicted as bringing plenty to the region in the past.\n\nAfter six extra unscheduled months of winter, the altar was covered in human sacrifices and the longhouse otherwise deserted, save for the corpses. \n\nAn expedition to the nearby fishing village found it abandoned as well, and piled high with snow. A few of us set up some ice fishing traps while Erikki and Tomas found the cave which was depicted on the altar. As fish appeared in the traps in an increasingly unsubtle manner, the cave was revealed to be the Lady's larder. She attempted to add Erikki and Tomas to her larder, and when they escaped, she summoned up a massive storm which we survived by digging an insulated snow cave.\n\nWhen she gave up trying to find us, we dragged a damaged longboat back to the great hall and I began repairing it while we discussed options. By 'we dragged' I mean to say that the wooden golem, currently built in the shape of a sled with a vaguely humanoid torso and face set in an eternal rictus of horror at his own existence. His name is Snow Scream. \n\nRepairs would take some time, so others went out to forage for food and to supply Sven with lumber for the boat. While Sven and Snow Scream were alone, one of the dead walked into the hall and sat by the fire. Sven worked up the courage to talk to the corpse, and discovered that the Lady in the Water was indeed a fertility goddess once, but has stopped being benevolent. Any who see her now become her prey, and in death become her servents. Having said this, the corpse stepped into the fire so that it wouldn't be her weapon.\n\nThe foraging parties returned, one bringing word that they found a hole in reality that leads to the branches of Yggdrasil. A potential escape, assuming we can manage not to fall off and into Nidhogg's mouth. In the end, we have to deal with the Lady, however, or she will hunt us forever. \n\nWe discuss ways to depower her - the altar to her could be deconsecrated, but only via human sacrifice. Being PCs and therefore insane, we go through a chain of logic wherein we discuss consecrating the boat as an altar to her so we can desecrate it later if we find someone *else* to sacrifice, consecrating the boat to the Aeser, and eventually arriving at consecrating the boat as an alter to itself so it can be used as metaphysical swap-space, and later sacrificed to any god or gods whose favor we feel like currying. \n\nSven mostly goes along with this because it's all theoretical anyway - the Lady is going to be difficult to kill in the first place, and practically impossible to kill specifically on the boat ritually. But hey, it's Fimbulwinter, you have to take hope where you can find it. \n\nWhen the repairs are finished and the Lady's undead minions are on their way, we hook up the boat to Snow Scream and ride it back to the coastal villiage. It's not fast, but it's faster than shambling corpses wading through nine feet of snow. When we arrive, Tomas summons a demon to desecrate the Lady's larder of corpses, and momens later the fight begins.\n\nCombat begins. We take a few pot shots at her and Clansig Toothbeard, in nine-foot-tall wolf mode, gets into position to attack her while Erikki tries to draw aggro. She has a held action which forces her to attack Clansig first, and very nearly drops him in one blow. However, because of the mechanics of this game, this means she has nothing left to defend with when Ara *takes over her body and begins to puppet her*.\n\nBy this I mean Ara forces this terrifying mermaid quasi-god to lay down in the boat that we've dedicated as an altar to itself and Sven, horrified that this whole thing wound up not being theoretical, cut its throat and let its life-blood soak into Fish-Killer, the God-Boat.\n\nWe're going to switch systems for a few weeks while our Storyteller figures out how to allocate divine powers to a boat in the system so we can sail down the coast, killing gods and monsters to sacrifice to Fish-Killer and giving it a new sobriquet every time.

        "text": "So me and [my RP group,](https://www.reddit.com/r/TTPloreplaycentral/) which usually does Twitch Plays Pokemon RPs, decided to do a Disney Villains Victorious RP, which is exactly what it sounds like. \n\nMy character was Toulouse, the orange kitten from the Aristocats, but with a slight twist to him, Epic Mickey style. You see, when Duchess and her kittens were being shipped to Timbuktu via unscrupulous pirates, one of them got a request from a wizard for some supplies, one of which was a cat. So the pirates grabbed the nearest cat they could find, which was Toulouse, and put him in the bag with the rest of the supplies. One of those supplies was the magic paintbrush from Epic Mickey, so Toulouse now has a Power called \"Colors of the Wind\" that allows him to create an object out of glowing blue paint once per encounter. The rules set by the GM are \"the object cannnot be more than large in size, must be inanimate, and dissapears at the end of the scene (battle/encounter).\" Pay attention, kids; that's going to be important by the end of this story.\n\nAnother one of our RPers plays as Mr. Gold, based on the Storybrooke resident from Once Upon A Time, and in the first session, Toulouse took a shine to Mr. Gold (who is of course very very interested in the cat with the magical paint paws). So they've pretty much been together throughout the RP. (And, ironically, Toulouse is actually the best fighter of the entire group, but this is not the story about how the kitten took down the Headless Horseman and then got sick from trying to eat the pumpkin. This is the story of the Eldritch Kitten, and I'm just getting started on that one.)\n\nSo. The session begins. Mr. Gold is looking for some European sprites in the middle of a forest near Sleepy Hollow (who knows how Never fairies got to the States anyway), and Toulouse of course is with him. We never found the fairies (our rolls were not kind to us), but we did hear voices in the distance, and the two of us went to check them out.\n\nSo we found this shack in a clearing, although \"shack\" might be too good a word to describe it -- it was, as our GM called it, \"clearly a stiff wind away from being a pile of debris.\" There was a dense black horse standing outside it (dense in every sense of the word; even Toulouse couldn't talk to it), and there were the three voices inside arguing with each other.\n\nToulouse meowed at the door, and the three voices were suddenly quiet. Mr. Gold backed away and indicated to Toulouse (somehow) that he should meow again and sound lost and alone. Toulouse does so; he's had plenty of practice.\n\nSo the voices inside say to each other: *\"You know, it think it is a cat.\" \"What's it doing around here, Donny?\" \"Shaddup. Someone might be here. we needs to listen at the door, real quiet like.\"*\n\nToulouse starts scratching at the door. There's a creaking sound, then silence. So Toulouse looks around for a hole in the shack to peer through, looks through it, and sees the three guys -- one tall, one normal-size, one a midget -- all leaning against the door and listening in. \n\nFinding a hole in the miserable abode that's large enough to squeeze through, Toulouse sneaks in, does a stealth check, and then knocks over something big and loud. The resulting crash shocks the three men into falling all over each other and knocking the door open.\n\nSo here's Mr. Gold, facing ~~Boggis and Bunce and Bean~~ Danny, Denny, and Donny Decroix, the latter three of which are arguing with each other over whose fault this all is.  *\"That was your fault, you pudding headed simpleton!\" \"Me? I didn't knock over a buncha pans!\"* While arguing, they are still completely oblivious to the fact that there is a kitten in their house.\n\nSo Mr. Gold says, *\"Good evening gentlemen, may I be of assistance?\"*\n\nThe three instantly stop fighting, stand up, and try to look casual. Toulouse does an insight check to see if there's anything interesting or suspicious in the house, but fails. \n\n*\"Who are you then?\"* Donny asks Mr. Gold.\n\n*\"Just a weary traveler and scholar looking for a place to rest my weary head for the night,\"* Gold responds. \n\nThe GM has Gold roll a deceit check for this, which he passes. The three figures completely fail to realize that there's no path to their shanty, there's a town about an hour away, and Mr. Gold is not equipped for long-term traveling. Toulouse finds a place to sit quietly, watch the four humans, and think to himself about what idiots the Ducroix brothers are.\n\n*\"Well I'm ah, I'm quite sorry but as you can see there really isn't even enough room for the three of us so I'm afraid we can't really be taking another,\"* Donny says to Mr. Gold.\n\n*\"Oh, I don't suppose you know where I could find a place to stay then?\"*\n\nDenny speaks up. *\"Oh yeah! There's a whole town just down that way, real nice and prosperous and-\"*\n\nThen Donny hits him sharply on the head. *\"Eh, sorry about my bother here, he just goes on and on and on if nobody* ***stops him.***\"\n\nToulouse does a second insight check on the room. Still nothing. (In fairness, he's distracted by imagining Creme de la Creme a la Whole Town Real Nice And Prosperous.)\n\n*\"So there isn't a town south of here?...\"* Mr. Gold asks. \n\nDonny, the bold-faced liar, says *\"Absolutely nothing.Oh, ah, no there, is. Is there? Might be. Think there is.That is. Dunno.\"* \n\nMr. Gold responds with *\"Well if there were a town just south of here, I'd imagine you would be there and not here and therefore there couldn't possibly be a town south of here right?\"* \n\nToulouse thinks, once again, of how stupid these men are, and he laughs a little under his breath.\n\n*\"What's he talking abot Donny?\"* Danny asks.\n\n*\"Hush now, the big kids are talkin',\"* Donny responds.\n\nMr. Gold sees a bunch of straw lying around the shack... straw that he can spin into gold. It's haying season, too, and there's plenty of it. So he keeps talking. *\"And if there isn't a town south, or for that matter anywhere nearby, and I really do need a place to stay the night, perhaps we could come to some sort of arrangement, a gentlemen's arrangement as it were, given that were are all gentlemen here, right gentlemen?\"*\n\nWith Gold still running off his amazing deceit roll, the Ducroixes still have no idea what's going on. That, plus probably using *arrangement* twice and *gentlemen* three times all in the same sentence probably scrambled their wee little minds. *\"Right...\"* says Donny.\n\nAnd then Danny opens his big mouth again. *\"We can't let him in Donny, tonight we've got-Ow!\"* and gets a good hit to the shin by one of his brothers\n\nMr. Gold motions for Toulouse to search again as he keeps talking. *\"Are you alright sir, you keep making rather distressed noises?\"*\n\n*\"Oh, he's just a bit clumsy, always tripping over himslef, heh,\"* says Donny the Chronic Liar. *\"Now look, I'm terribly sorry but we have a., a, a prior engagement tonight.\"* \n\nToulouse, meanwhile, from a finally successful insight check, has found a half-carved wooden sabre, and knocks it off the table to make sure Mr. Gold sees it. \n\nThe Three Stooges don't even notice this, but Mr. Gold does. Gold does an insight check and figures out that these three aren't from around this area. He keeps doling out his spiel: *\"But sirs, it is not like I expect you let me stay here for free. I am quite willing to pay handsomely to have a roof over my head for the night.\"*\n\nDonny is caught off guard. *\"Look I'm tellin' ya, we... what was that about payment?\"*\n\n*\"I can pay...in gold.\"*\n\nAs the GM put it, \"You could swear a faint *cha-ching* is heard.\" \n\n*\"What would you be doing out here with any gold? Are you crazy?\"* Donny asks. \n\nOnce again, Danny makes the mistake of speaking. *\"There could be bandi-uhf.\"* \n\nMr. Gold keeps playing dumb. *\"As I said, I am a traveler, and I often find myself having to deal with those who only speak the language of the coin. Sad but true. There are so few good people left in the world.\"*\n\n*\"Oh, yes its a real shame, real shame...\"* says Denny.\n\n*\"Well if you're really sure, I guess I should be on my way...\"*\n\nDonny interrupts. *\"Now, why would you want to stay here? Lets not be hasty.\"* (Toulouse is in the corner of the room, eating a beetle.)\n\n*\"Why because with with now town nearby, it looks like this is the only place that doesn't involve camping in the woods, and I am so tired of camping alone in the woods with just me...and my money.\"*\n\nAnd then comes the clincher.\n\n*\"...oh and a demonic cat thats following me everywhere.\"*\n\n*\"what?\"* asks Donny. \n\nToulouse is about to be offended, but Gold winks at him. *\"Haven't you heard the rumors about this area?\"* he asks the Ducroixes.\n\n*\"rumors?\"*\n\n*\"My my, it's a wonder you haven't...but no...it's too horrible to think about...It's a miracle you're still alive out here.:\"*\n\n*\"What?!?\"*\n\n*\"My dear friends. Have you never heard the stories about this place? The Legend of Sleepy Hollow and other stories about what goes on in these woods and surroudning country?\"*\n\n*\"oh, he just means the Horsem-ack\"* (Obviously Danny.)\n\n*\"can't say we have, can't say we have.\"* (Obviously Donny.)\n\nMr. Gold's eyes seemed to bulge. *\"Not just the Horseman my friends! Although he is particularly fearsome! All kinds of fel creatures lurk here. I have encountered one myself.\"*\n\n*\"what's that?\"*\n\nToulouse is getting excited by this point.\n\n*\"Why at first I mistook it for an ordinary housecat, for that is what it appears to be at a glance. It followed me for a while and kept my company. But appearances can be oh so deceiving, this was not cat...but a DEMON! Some eldritch liquid stained its paws like blood and it seemed to be able to use fel magic to manipulate its environment and create objects where nothing existed before!\"*\n\nThe GM has Gold roll another deceit, and it works. As the GM puts it, \"The three brothers are now completely confused and have no idea what is happening.They will now agree to almost anything, if only to get this salvador dali nightmare to stop.\"\n\nMr. Gold motions to Toulouse, who then uses Colors of the Wind to create *a giant realistic cat marionette out of glowing blue paint, right in midair above the area directly in front of the three brothers, dropping down from above like a cat out of hell.*\n\nAnd the GM's response is... [literally this.](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlatWhat) Literally that link.\n\n*\"OH NO, IT'S FOUND ME, FLEE IF YOU VALUE YOUR IMMORTAL SOULS!\"*\n\nI laughed myself sick watching it. I'm laughing myself sick right this second *typing* it. And Toulouse himself laughed so hard, it sounded like demonic yowling.\n\nWelp. Goombye Ducroix brothers. The three of them leapt onto their dense black horse and rode off into the sunset, screaming in fear. The entire RP team cracked up. It was an even more awesome feeling than watching Toulouse beat up the Headless Horseman in a previous session, and that's a fact.\n\nThe GM's response? \"And now, I too will agree to anything to end this salvador dali nightmare.\"\n\nSo. This is how Mr. Gold and Toulouse scared off a group of bandits, claimed themselves an (admittedly lousy) \"headquarters,\" and acquired a bunch of baby gold (although that last bit might be difficult to take advantage of, because I seriously doubt the Ducroixes ever owned a spinning wheel).\n\nMr. Gold's response? *\"Idiots.\"*\n\nExperience points in Disney Villains Victorious are called Lessons. \"Well guys,\" our GM said, \"I think everyone gets a lesson after that display. It certainly taught me something.\"\n\nYes. Yes it did. Never get between Toulouse the Eldritch Kitten and a bunch of straw.\n\n\"I cannot begin to even.\"\n\n\"I just did what felt naturally,\" 'Mr. Gold' told the GM.\n\n\"That scares me.\"\n\nWe're planning on taking this act on the road. There's plenty of straw in it.",

        "text": "The story begins with my party, made up of a halfling rogue (Me), a human summoner, an alchemist (Also human), an Oread cleric, and a  half-Orc fighter.\n\nThe party was tasked with arresting a militia deserter and his band of mercenaries, who were all holed up in an abandoned butcher shop. It was important that we take at least the deserter alive, but we had free reign to deal with everyone else.\n\nSo the party comes up with a plan: My PC would sneak close to the building with a [Thunder Stone](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment---final/goods-and-services/herbs-oils-other-substances#TOC-Thunderstone), set it off to draw them out, and we would ambush them.\n\nThe plan starts out easy enough, I sneak in and set the stone off right on their roof. As predicted, two of the thugs come out to see whats going on. As I am sneaking up to stab one of them, the half-Orc gets the amusing idea to try and disguise himself as an animal. He does this by simply yelling\n\n\"MOO!\"\n\nNeedless to say, the thugs aren't fooled and a confrontation starts. While the cleric and the half-orc fight the thugs, I try to sneak into the building and the rest of the party attempts to enter through the back door.\n\nOne of the two thugs spots me (Natural 20 on perception) and slams me with two crossbow bolts (one was a crit). I immediately drop, with 2 HP left. I end up crawling behind the building and necking a potion to heal.\n\nAt the same time, the rest of the party discovers that the thunder stone has awoken two OTHER guards: boars. The boars break out of their pen and begin trampling the alchemist and summoner.\n\nA few rounds pass, with the party (sans my rogue) dispatching the two mercs and the boars, albeit with some difficulty. (The half-Orc killed the final boar by BITING ITS FACE OFF) and we all regroup.\n\nThere are still 2 other mercs and the deserter to tangle with, so my rogue decides to try and sneak into the building and see whats up. However, the rather bloody and beaten half-Orc decides to try and follow me inside. Luckily he rolls well on the stealth check.\n\nSo we get inside, and we find the ground floor is clear, but there is a narrow staircase leading up. The fighter taps me on the shoulder and gestures to a small bag of marbles he had been carrying this whole time. \n\nA plan is quickly hatched: The half-Or dumps the marbles at the foot of the stairs, counts down with his fingers (3...2...1) and again yells\n\n\"MOO!\"\n\nWe then both book it out of the building.\n\nWithin seconds we hear a merc: \"What the hell was all tha-AUGH!\" followed by a loud CRASH. The plan had worked, a bit too well. The one merc had come running down the stairs, tripped on the marbles, and brained himself on the butcher counter. He was outright dead. (Later we found out he had double 1'd on his rolls)\n\nThe last merc sees his friend dead, runs out of the shop in a rage, and we quickly cut him down. \n\nFinally, after searching the building for our target, we found him sprawled unconscious in the yard. He had attempted to leap from the 2nd story window, missed the landing, and knocked himself out. We tied him up and carried him to the town guard.",

High precision damage.\n\nPaladin-specialized in shields and axes. Tankier than a Churchill.\n\nMonk-specialized in hands and feet.

This is important later.) \n\nStory:\nWe had been investigating an evil cult within the city we were occupying for a few sessions. They seemed to worship mind flayers as gods of madness and chaos. We had uncovered plans to eradicate the city by enacting a ritual to take over everyone’s mind and make them attack each other. The ritual was taking place inside the catacombs of the city and required us to fight our way to it through to the center. Bard even managed to hit someone with a rock. Once we had reached the ritual, the cult had already amassed enough magical energy to level the catacombs with us inside. Being the only one with magical ability, I set off to try and disperse the energies safely, as my comrades fought the end boss. By the time they had beaten them to a pulp, Bard had figured out that the only way was to complete the ritual and make the city inhabitants do something non harmful. So, the five of us started completing the ritual the only way a bard knows how, through song. What song? What did we make the city do? [Well, to answer both questions.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6M6samPEMpM) With the magic expelled safely and all the inhabitants tired from rocking their bodies, we set off on our next adventure.\n\n*if interested, I can also post about the time we started a revolution with the power of music.*\n",

        "text": "Our party, The King's Ransom, had a problem. We had been contracted by a king, who for the purposes of this tale I shall call “King Not-quite-as-evil-as-the-other-ones”, in defense against a foreign power. In the course of our duties, we had taken hostage a minor noble from the enemy army, and we needed to interrogate him. The need was particularly pressing, because we had captured this noble unexpectedly while we were in the process of spiking the grain stores of the enemy with a diarrhea-inducing poison (this, as will become relevant later, was the wizard’s idea), and we needed to find out how much he knew about our plans. Perhaps even more importantly, a search of his person revealed a hammered disc of metal that looked suspiciously like as orcish talisman. [(See my previous tale for why this had us so worried.)](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3az6e1/dnd_5e_thats_the_wizards_marching_song_or_we_must/)\n\nEach member of the party tried their hand at getting him to talk, and all of them failed.  In turn, the bard’s personable façade, the rouge’s underworld tricks, the ranger’s general weirdness, and lastly the paladin with a good cop/bad cop routine that I am frankly still amazed the paladin did not end up Falling for, came up short. \nAt last, the wizard was the only PC left able to make an intimidate check. With a good alignment, dumped charisma and a strength of 8, you would think this attempt would be doomed to failure. But as that poisoning proved, this wizard was creative. And as a great man once said, \"a creative wizard is not a threat. They are an extinction event.”\n\nThe wizard waited until dusk, partly for effect and partly to prepare the necessary spells. As the last rays of the dying sun cast black shadows upon the forest floor, a figure emerged.\n\nThe figure was cloaked, hood drawn, hunched over. It moved in a way that felt undefinably Wrong; at first it hobbled slowly, leaning heavily on a bent oaken staff. Then, suddenly, it shifted forward liquidly, like a snake. The birds of the glen grew quiet. As the figure approached, the prisoner saw a face framed by deep, twisted wrinkles and set with a huge, toothless grimace. He spoke then, in a broken whisper, but still somehow the loudest thing in earshot.\n\n“I… understand you have been giving my compatriots a difficult time with some… questions. They have sent me to convince you to… reconsider.”\n\nThe prisoner’s haughty expression cracked as the air seemed to fill with otherworldly noises and mad gibberings. They appeared to grow louder as the wizard crept forward. The prisoner tried to squirm away. He found he could not. As the wizard drew closer, he could do nothing but stare in horror, his limbs seemingly frozen by the mage’s stare.\n\n“I know who you are now!” The noble’s voice rang out. You’re the King’s Ransom! (the tale behind our company of adventure’s name shall wait for another time.) You’ll get nothing out of me, demons!”\n\nThe wizard’s head tilted at this, and then, a flame sprung up from his hand, flaring carelessly at the stubble on the noble’s face.\n\n“Heh. You call me a demon… I have killed demons. I have ended the very spawn of Orcus and I assure you, the well-deserved torments of the Nine Hells are nothing compared to what one of my power can do to *you*!”\n\nThe flame licked ever closer, and upon his back the prisoner felt a horde of tiny, horrible, scrabbling legs.\n\nThe prisoner screamed. And when he finished screaming, he talked.\n\nWhen the wizard felt satisfied with the noble’s answers, he allowed his magic to fall away. The ghost sounds faded, the summoned spider swarm returned from whence they came, the flame winked out, the hold person ended, the spell of Disguise Self faded to reveal a young thirty-something in simple blue robes, and he told his raven familiar to let the other birds get back to what they were doing. Not one hair on the prisoner’s head had been harmed.\n\n“You’ve been a good boy.”\n",

        "text": "To start this tale off, let's set the waythefuckback machine to about a month or so ago. A friend of mine (for anonymity's sake, let's call him Max) had been reading my Gametales and talking to several of [the Glorious Chucklefucks](https://i.imgur.com/rOaUt25.jpg) about our shenanigans in the world of D&amp;D, and he wanted to try it out for himself. Unfortunately, Max was too god damn busy to commit to joining the group full-time, but decided to roll up a hypothetical character anyway, just for fun. I took a look at it, thought about it...and I had an idea. Max didn't have to become a member of the Chucklefucks' party to join the group. He could be an antagonist instead.\n\nHence Mumkhar, a wood elf with green hands, two swords, and some OP bullshit granted to him via the plot, was born. The PCs first met him at a large party hosted in their honor, where Mumkhar teleported on stage, murdered a high priest, then teleported away again while his henchmen arrived and began murdering party guests. The point of this attack was to conceal the simultaneous kidnapping of five prominent scholars of ancient lore. My plan for this arc was to have the PCs track down the organization responsible and rescue the scholars, but only after the kidnappers had retrieved the information they were looking for from them. Max, however, came up with a plan: have his people set up a fake criminal organization in a nearby city with the same insignia as his, secretly give the PCs clues leading them right to said fake organization, then plant documents in the dummy group's hideout establishing a false motive for them carrying out the party attack. The plan was solid, and the players fell for it entirely. So...the arc ended there. Max won that round, and his true organization went back underground while I pulled a new plot arc out of my ass.\n\nMumkhar next resurfaced when one of his spies was captured in the Han Empire, where the PCs happened to be at the time. The empress, the PCs' old friend Echo, asked the Chucklefucks to help guard this spy during his interrogation in case his employers tried to free him. Sure enough, Mumkhar and his soldiers attacked the prison in an effort to do just that. While the PCs were busy fighting scrubs outside, Mumkhar managed to teleport inside the spy's cell, where Echo was personally interrogating the captive. Caught off guard, Echo was severely wounded by Mumkhar, and she went down. Silently texting Max as events unfolded, I cringed as he told me what Mumkhar did next: to confirm that she was dead in a particularly villainous fashion, he force-fed Echo a tablet of a certain poison which causes the victim to be eaten alive by millions of tiny spiders which hatch in their bloodstream. The PCs burst into the room a moment later, and Mumkhar grabbed the spy and teleported away, telepathically receiving the intel that the spy had gathered at the same while doing so. Unfortunately for him, Patrick, in weregoat form, rolled a 20 to leap across the cell and grab him right before he teleported, and in so doing was teleported with him. Noel, meanwhile, having rolled high enough to spot the capsule of poison as Mumkhar had force-fed it to Echo, rushed over and telekinetically pulled the capsule out of her throat before it could take effect, saving her life.\n\nAs soon as he noticed his unexpected passenger on the other end of his teleport, Mumkhar attempted to stab him. He failed, and Patrick punched him in the throat. Seven times. When Nathaniel teleported in moments later after scrying Patrick, things got worse. Time Stop+Delayed Blast Fireball+another Fireball=rekt. Fortunately this didn't kill Mumkhar, and I was able to pull a classic \"there's no sign of him, but no one could have survived that\" to have Max's character live to fight another day. After teleporting Patrick and Nathaniel back to the prison, along with the charred corpse of the spy, the Chucklefucks set about reanimating him in hopes of extracting the information he'd given to Mumkhar. They succeeded in doing so, learning that the enemy planned to awaken the Hulks of Zoretha, ancient engines of destruction buried far to the east. They set out immediately, hoping to intercept the enemy and stop the awakening ritual. Donovan, familiar with tropes, knew that Mumkhar was still alive out of character, and vowed to kill him.\n\nCut to the latest session, right before which Max, continuing to be too damn good at being a villain, decides to leave one last surprise for the Chucklefucks before they reach the Hulks; he has Mumkhar go ahead of them to a village which they will have to pass through and informs the villagers that the legendary heroes and personal friends of the empress are going to be passing through soon. The villagers, of course, prepare a grand feast to honor the heroes' presence, and Mumkhar poisons the wine with the aforementioned spider poison. The players are suspicious, but their characters all drink the damn wine when a toast is made. Friedrich, being immune to poison, manages to roll well enough to get around to each of the party members and Lay on Hands the poison out of them before it can take effect, but the villagers...they all die very horrific, painful deaths. JD, unconcerned, rolls to loot the village. Son of a bitch rolls a 100, so he discovers the Earthheart Forge hidden beneath the mayor's house, giving him all the tools he needed to forge a weapon which will, according to prophecy, make him the king of the dwarves. Leaving their NPC blacksmith there to begin forging this weapon, the PCs continue on toward the Hulks.\n\nShortly after arriving at the Hulks' resting place, the PCs find Mumkhar performing the awakening ritual. He activates it as they enter, beginning the awakening process, and then Max, who has been with us for this session to \"observe\" makes his big reveal: \"You thought it was the DM, but it was actually me, DIO!\"\n\nUfokingwot.jpg?\n\nThe players are suitably surprised and impressed, and then battle is joined. Mumkhar gets a shit initiative roll and goes after everyone in the party, and they take the opportunity to fucking ruin his shit. Not once, but twice he gets Time Stop 1v1 rekt, and by the time it's finally his turn, Mumkhar is down to only 86 HP. Shit's looking grim. Bleeding heavily and down on one knee, Mumkhar looks up at the PCs, already gloating over their victory. He casts Time Stop. As it turns out, Time Stop+three fucking Delayed Blast Fireballs+another Fireball=TPK. Everyone dies, including the hitherto unkillable Friedrich Eisenberg, except for Patrick, who was outside the explosion's range. Well fuck, the general consensus goes. Fortunately for Friedrich, he was long ago granted the power to instantly return from the dead one time, and so in a bright flash of light he gets back up. Looking Mumkhar dead in the eyes, he says these words: \"I wish you'd never existed.\"\n\nMumkhar's reaction is much like Max's, one of confusion. \"Are you taunting me?\" He doesn't know that Friedrich, [very long ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2vxfi6/dd_5e_my_campaign_finale_part_1_motherfucking/) had gotten a wish from the Wabbajack and never used it. So when Friedrich says he wishes this motherfucker never existed, the Retconn God ~~himself~~ ~~herself~~ itself ~~descends~~ ascends and unravels the very space time continuum, ripping Mumkhar out of reality. \n\nSpace and time then proceed to reform along the path of least resistance; everything up to the prison attack happens exactly as it had before, with a different member of the organization filling Mumkhar's role. When it comes time to confront Echo, however, the new guy rolls poorly and dies at her hands. Echo isn't wounded, and the enemy doesn't learn what the spy found out about the Hulks of Zoretha, including where they are. PCs head there unopposed, and with no one to give them advance notice the villagers are unable to organize any kind of feast before the PCs move on. No Earthheart Forge, but no mass murder either. When they reach the Hulks of Zoretha, the PCs find their resting place still sealed and the statues themselves still dormant. Only Friedrich and Patrick, having witnessed the Retconn, maintain their memories of the previous timeline.\n\nAnd that is the story of Mumkhar, a player-controlled villain who came in on the game like a wrecking ball, deviously harassing and nearly wiping out the party, before being completely erased from reality, past, present, and future. Not a bad run.",

        "text": "What the hell does turnabout mean? Anyway, ignore the lame Pheonix Wright reference, it's time for [more stories from my campaign](http://redd.it/3b7igg)!\n\nIt's at this point that I become rather proud of my players- while others might be bitching about not having the opportunity to slay a dragon, these guys politely asked if they could have a non-combat session so that they could develop their characters with roleplaying and exercise their skill checks. It warms the soul! *Sniff*\n\nAnyway, I obliged with a wonderful tangled-up clusterfuck of a mission. The party [(Pratena the cyclops brawler, Rose the dullahan ranger, Barrel the halfling rogue and Thoth the shabti magus)](http://imgur.com/a/1azWs) was tasked with rooting out the core of some sort of extensive crime ring that had been plauging a nearby city. Now, this crime ring business had happened before in another place, so the party was warned that whoever was at the heart of this business was particularly crafty and would probably bolt at the first sign of trouble. And the words \"crime ring\" didn't do the situation justice- just about every legitimate business in this city had been turned into a front for something shady, like smuggling, slavers, drug deals, or assasination. The place was on a downward spiral, and life for the common man was quickly becoming hell.\n\nSo, when the party walks into town in the sleepy farmlands on the outskirts, what's the first thing that they do? Well, Thoth with his nifty new cybereyes starts gibbering about whispered voices and then brutally murders a shifty-looking alpaca, using Pratena and her voracious appetite to hide the evidence. Off to a great start.\n\nAfter that, the party hits up a local tavern to get the down-low on the place, with Rose actually gathering information while Barrel remains covert and Thoth starts drinking things intended for rock trolls. They get information on some local happenings, like a recent murder and some good places to go for a \"good time\". So they all head to the town square to meet the supposed murderer, an elf who deliberately evoked the image of a rat. Ratelf is adamant that he was just there on legitimate business, and while he knew the victim and had even argued with the man, he had a solid alibi for the actual crime. Ratelf continued on to blame Nightcaptain, who it seemed had a personal beef with Ratelf for some reason. Maybe the reason was that Ratelf was a sorta shifty individual.\n\nRose went to check out Ratelf's alibi, and found that it was indeed legit. The shopkeeper seemed completely unpreturbed that a man could be framed for murder, as apparently this sort of stuff happened all the time. The shopkeep went on to offer some \"favors\" for the \"party\" that Rose was throwing, wink wink nudge nudge. Rose immediately decided that YES, a party would be the BEST THING, and quickly ran off to get a bunch of very potent and expensive drugs.\n\nEveryone else, meanwhile, decided that the thing to do would be to check out the murder vic. They found the scene, body still there, and talked the guards into taking their lunch breaks while they poked around. Via bribes. Was everyone in this goddamn city corrupt? Anyway, close inspection turned up that the killer had been clean and precise, a single injury with almost no signs of struggle. From the front. Everyone immediately started thinking \"assassin\", and Pratena's spidey senses kicked in (nat 20 on a perception roll) and she quickly found a vital clue- a praying mantis that had been eyeing the crime scene. For some reason, it could talk.\n\nThoth interrogated the mantis, being the only one that spoke its language, and managed to suss out that the mantis had a boss who was of the Crimson Assasin class, and was sort of a big deal (according to the mantis). Thoth thought quickly, and dared the mantis that the party could totally kick the butt of this assassin chump, if the mantis would just tell him where the assassin was hiding they'd go throw down the gauntlet. The mantis, realizing he was being played but way too proud of his master to back down, told the party. Blimey, that was easy.\n\nSo, in short order, the party knocked on the door of the local entomologist, Bugsassin. The mantis started immediately screeching for his master to slaughter these bumbling fools. Said master instead swore that the mantis was a fucking idiot, slammed a very heavy door in the party's face, and fucking booked it. The door was so spectacularly heavy, in fact, that even Pratena's \"knocking\" didn't open it. But Thoth just used Dimension Door to take him and Barrel inside, where they discovered that the deadly assasin had crit failed initiative and tumbled down the stairs. About a dozen attacks of opportunity later, the Bugsassin was incapacitated and tied up in chair. Turns out even highly-trained killing machines are still fucked when they come up against four-to-one odds, and every one of those four is an incredibly well-armed and irate adventurer.\n\nBugsassin calmly told the party that he had, indeed, killed the murder victim. It was a job. It was HIS job. And while he was honor-bound not to reveal the name of his employer, his employer wasn't the one who had a kukri rammed through his kneecap, so if the party just happened to be at a specific place at a specific time while wearing some specific stuff, they might find \"employment\", hint hint. The party thanked him for his cooperation and left to go bag a crime lord.\n\nThoth ended up as the one wearing the red cloak and bug-shaped mask, with Barrel acting as a backpack and voice for the duo. The less conspicuous party members hung out nearby, in case things went south. Suprrisingly, things did not go south- the crime lord showed up on-time, bought the disguise, and promptly hired the party to kill (suprise suprise) the party. Seeing as the crime lord didn't have line-of-sight on the duo, Thoth slapped Barrel on the ground to continue haggling over price while he himself turned invisible, snuck around the corner, discovered that the crimelord was a bitchy harpy (both literally and figuratively) and promptly replaced her blathering with a cloud of sparkly lights, courtesy of one Merciful Shocking Grasp spell.\n\nSome brief interrogation later, Harpy refused to tell anything about her boss and somehow managed to hit some sort of switch that she was hiding on her person (nobody had thought to search her). An ominous rumbling sound in the distance distrubed the party, but nothing immediately charged at them, so they kept up the interrogation. Thoth, who had been acting rather erratic through this whole business (saying stuff about chanting voices that nobody else could hear), decided on a rather extreme solution to the problem- he force-fed the harpy some very, very powerful and incredibly addictive drugs. Right in the middle of the harpy tripping balls, the party was suddenly beset by Betty the Adamantine Golem.\n\nFor those of you not in the know, an Adamantine Golem is an incredibly powerful juggernaut, immune to magic, with damage resistance out the ass and fast heal to back it up. Its AC was absurd, and it hit like a truck duct-taped to another, bigger truck. Even Rose couldn't tank its blows. Oh, and it was nearly impossible to kill. The party was so fucking screwed. It was just fortunate that the damn thing moved at three tiles per round.\n\nThe party (very wisely) decided to back off, get some breathing room, and one skyscraper-leveling haymaker to Pratena's face convinced them to stay out of Charge range, too. Their attacks were dinking off it, and what little damage they did was almost immediately healed. Oh, and did I mention that it was immune to magic? Because it totally was.\n\nThoth stopped the thing dead in its tracks with a first-level spell. He casted [Grease](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/g/grease) on the ground in front of it. And this unstoppable juggernaut's rampage was brought to a sudden and hilarious end, as its pathetic reflex save and NONEXISTENT acrobatics skill meant that the party got treated to a five-minute rendition of [golem](http://i.imgur.com/t4VMAX5.gif) [breakdancing](http://i.imgur.com/vDwWR9j.jpg). Barrel interrupted this song-and-dance by calling in the party's means of transit, a FLYING GODDAMN GUNSHIP, and blasting the thing with the main cannons and an incredible amount of alchemist's ice. Long story short, the golem was busted into pieces and frozen solid, it wasn't going anywhere anytime soon.\n\nIn the meantime, Thoth secured the harpy by using the Teleport spell to bring her back to base, and then having a lovely little detox session full of pointed questions. To everyone's surprise, the harpy kept passing the will saves, and was incredibly obstinate about not giving up any information- but, eventually, the lure of the drugs won out and she sold out her boss. The rest of the party was going about their own business, with Barrel organizing some backup, Rose throwing a massive party (she somehow managed to get drunk, despite everything) and Pratena paying a visit to the local watch house. While there, she discovered that Nightcaptain was actually a pretty stand-up guy, and that the case against Ratelf (due to be tried and executed tomorrow) was flimsy as all fuck, and Nightcaptain was going along with the farce to see if he could turn up any REAL evidence of ACTUAL wrongdoing in the meantime (Ratelf was pretty shifty). However, this had fallen by the wayside when a goddamn adamantine golem had casually walked through the houses of dozens of people, causing immense property damage and quite a few injuries. Ratelf was released on the grounds of \"we can't be arsed\", and plans were drawn up by everyone.\n\nPratena was summarily deputized into doing some \"community service\", and between her, Thoth and Barrel, they managed to figure out who was at the heart of this mess- of all things, it was an awakened goddamn alpaca, named Fluffles. Seriously, it was the mastermind to this whole thing- the drug deals, slave trade, framing, murder, smuggling, all of it was the idea of this fluffy bastard. Oh, and the fucker had bolted the instant that Betty the Wonder Golem had emerged from its peaceful slumber. Pratena quickly orgaized the night guard to go hunting for all of the alpacas, and when most of them were wrangled, she set off on the trail of the mastermind Fluffles. Now, alpacas could run pretty fast, having four legs and everything, but Fluffles had been spending the past few years in a pen, chewing grass and scheming. Pratena had been on rough-and-rumble adventures and hardly needed to sleep. it wasn't even a contest, Pratena tracked down the bastard without so much as breaking a sweat, and triumphantly carried him into a prison cell with no significant fuss. Mystery solved, conspiracy thwarted, golem dismantled, GG everyone!\n\n[NEXT TIME ON \"Professor Thoth and the Curious Village\", SIGNIFICANT FUSS AND BLAZING INSIGNIAS!](http://redd.it/3d7sil)",

        "text": "Last year, around this time, I started a game with 3 friends. Since I was the only one who knew something about the rules, I was the GM, but, truth to be told, I kinda sucked at it, and my storytelling capabilities are rather poor too. Also, I tried to brew my own world, but I don't think I succeeded.\n\nTo add to my inexperience, I also had to prepare on a rather strict schedule: since we were all on holiday, and we already knew we wouldn't see each other for another year, we had to wrap it up in 3 weeks. As such, we played every afternoon and sometimes evening. \n\nOf the campaign (that I consider a trainwreck, because I rushed the finale, and the story I tried to tell was awful), I however remember a few defining moments: this was my favourite.\n\nSo, it was evening, and I wanted to go off the epic fantasy tale for a bit, and was tired of dungeon crawls, so I decided to have a narrative session.  \nNow, before we continue, it's important to note that two of my players were 12, one was 14, and I was 17. So there is a bit of an age gap. Also, I am much more knoweldgeable in tropes and cliches than they are.\n\nSo, when they arrive, I have them give them their phones, then turn off the lights down while I close the windows so no light can shine through. Then, using my phone, as the only lightsource, we start playing. \n\nThe night was dark, and they are woke up by a noise: a perception check reveals it was two bandits, who were planning to kill them in their sleep and steal their gear: the rogue had two silver, ornate knives, while the ninja had a coat of armor of silvery metal that faintly shone in certain situations, they hadn't figured out which. Lastly the paladin had a golden sword with a dragon head carved on the pommel. Fancy gear for a group of travellers.\n\nAfter making quick work of the bandits, they find on their bodies a piece of paper, telling them there were more on a camp deep into the forest. Bloodthirsty as always (and I have a nice, but unrelated story about the paladin thirst for blood), they start looking for the camp, and quickly get lost.  \nAfter a few hours, they suddendly feel encrouched by a familiar magic, but they can't quite place why they know it. Soon after, they see a decrepit old tower (couldn't be more cliched) and of course they enter, because a plot hook is a plot hook, even when disguised with the subtlety of a charging Tarrasque.\n\nNow, the light situation comes in: I turn off the flashlight, and start playing my game.\n\nKnowing they can't remember their stat blocks yet, I play onto this, having them roll for acrobatics, with the addendum they can only use stats they know (which I memorized, so I know they aren't cheating). If they don't remember, no bonus.\n\nSo, their first roll see them scrambling both in game and in real life, because I added a sense of danger I haven't put yet anywhere (their gear was quite overpowered compared to what they had faced until then, and now it couldn't help them).\n\nThey misteriously pass the roll, even with an awful result or two. \nIn game, a few arrows whizz past them, and a flash of blinding light (my flashlight) scares them. Apart from that incident, they reach the stairs fumbling, but safe.\n\nThe second floor present a change: there is a faint but pervasive purple light, and they see a great deal of bookshelves. Now, in the faint light I am projecting through a flashlight and a purple shirt, they decide to read some, but they can't make anything out of the books. However, the runes feel eerily familiar.\n\nNow even more unnerved by this, they go to the third floor, and notice that where there should have been a big hole in the wall the room is instead quite cozy, and look like a tavern room, if it wasn't for the green fire (light coloured through a green bottle).  \nOh, and the chatty skeletons that are gambling near the fireplace. So, the party attempts to strike a conversation, but fails, and get ignored. \n\nThe oh so reckless rogue attack one of the undead with his knives, and with his surprise the skeleton pulverises, and the dust get absorbed by his magical blades. Thinking them weak, the paladin tries to strike the other down, but with no success. His big, two handed sword fails to even damage the now angered skeleton. However, when the rogue attacks him, he again pulverises and get absorbed.\n\nSuddendly, why the adventurers are still puzzled by what happened, they hear a booming, but at the same time faint (don't ask) voice, that asks the cliched question \"Who are you to disturb my domain?\". Admittedly, I only did it to hear the rogue scramble to answer something resembling diplomacy.\n\nAnyway, the voice isn't heard again, and after a few minutes in the spectral green light, they go upstairs, because fuck being careful, right?  \nUpstairs, it's a bit more dungeon like and \"gamey\": there is a labyrinth made of arcs of lightning, and I draw it on the battlemap. Each turn, it changes a bit, but I throw a d20 or 2 each time, just to make it look like it actually has some sense behind it. It doesn't.  Also, the light colour is changing each turn, and they speculate it relates to the effects the bolts will have on them. Not willing to take risks, though, they move slowly until they are clear of the maze, with just a few checks made to ensure they didn't get hit.\n\nAt the end of it, another strange event happen, and the armor of the ninja get struck by all the lightnings. Of course, with no ill effect to him, and instead a strange feeling he can't explain. But it vanishes soon enough, and, now determined to find out what the hell is happening, they keep climbing the tower.\n\nNow, here they also realize that they are actually higher than the tower looked like from the outside, and the now intermittent light isn't help shake off the sense of strangeness and doom they feel.\n\nNow, since this is becoming way too long, and nothing really interest happens, for a while, lets skip a few uneventful floors, and jump to another library, this time bathed in orange. There, the ninja manages to read an inscription under a suit of armour, and to their surprise it animates, asking for \"their purpose\".\n\nSince curiosity doesn't seem to sate the construct, they instead try to find clues around the room, and find none. A short fight has to ensue, because as much as I wanted to avoid fighting, if someone tries to smite a magical armour, I have to at least have it react.\n\nNow, the voice from before appears again, and asks why they were damaging his house, and now they finally start talking. \n\nThe voice is interested in their magical footprints (of course coming from their gear) and asks them to keep climbing the tower, as they will reach him soon.\n\nNow, until then I had played with the lightning as a way to cheaply create an unnerving setting, that I couldn't manage to just describe, because I really suck at storytelling. Now, however, came the real reason I wanted dark.\n\nI shut down the flashlight again, and have the voice explain, while they are climbing the tower, that he is a lich, but doesn't mean harm to the world, since he has retired from it long ago, and the tower they are in is a pocket plane he created for himself.\n\nWhen they reach him, still in complete darkness, I play my card (and it somehow had an effect, I  still can't figure how they didn't expect it): I light my face from below, [like this](http://media.tumblr.com/53c27ca697789955c59035e3c39f8305/tumblr_inline_mpj7gqWba21qz4rgp.gif).\n\nSomehow, I manage to scare them, and set the tone for the next of the evening, that instead continues with normal lightining.\n\nHowever, now they are scared of something, and have associated the lich with evil.\n\nThis means after he has examined them, when he tells them that the reason all the strange stuff happened is because the suit of armor and the knives were made in ancient times by his brother, him too a lich, but an evil one. In fact, our friendly undead mage has chosen the road of undeath to be ready to fight his evil counterpart when the times of his inevitable conquest of the world happens. \n\nSo, because of this rivalry, anything that is created by one of the brothers is highly damaging for the magic of the other. However, they discover that their artifacts also become more powerful the longer they absorb the blood of their creator, which casually hands it down as a way to forge contracts with his followers. \n\nAnyway, since it's late, and the evening ended soon after, they decide to fight the cults of the evil lich to empower themselves for the final battle, still fearing, however, that the tower lich will betray them. All thanks to some lights.\n\n\nA few more awesome things happened that month, that I can tell you if you enjoyed this (which I hope you did).\nI can tell you of the time they diced with Death, or when they caused a crusade to break out to solve a riddle.  \nThere was the time they blew out a magic academy by experimenting with forces they should have staid clear of, or of the time they casually summoned a daemon lord because they can't read the signals of what's happening.\n\nBut for now, I think that's all.",

        "text": "[&lt;&lt; previous](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3bo141/vtmmedthe_new_adventures_of_jalees_kamal/)\n\nFinal goals have been nailed down. I won’t share them here, as I know at least a handful of my fellow players read this sub occasionally, but I will share a few that are ‘public knowledge’, more-or-less:\n\n1. Achieve Golconda on the Path of Honorable Accord\n2. Deal with the city’s problems\n5. Successfully complete a subplot without involving Jalees directly.\n6. Any Black Hand member shows up the Inquisition, except Jalees.\n10. Any session in which Jalees takes no action that needs a dice roll.\n\nThe rest of the second session was getting to know the players, their characters and the game world. The third session was spent fleshing out the more prominent members of the column with ST, while keeping things reasonable and planning an impromptu Sabbat festival for morale. The festival just so happened to coincide with the following session, the first ‘zoo game’.\n\nThe other players did not understand my purpose in the game, and I can’t exactly blame them - at first glance things look pretty bad. Mostly the comments and discussion centered around the difference in XP and how utterly statted my sheet was - 1700 xp, as compared to an average of 200 for most other characters. It took a while for my fellow players to convince the rest that I had no intention of ruining their game, and in fact had already made their game more enjoyable by running so many distinct and unique characters - taking a load off of ST for creating and running a cast of NPCs to provide interesting dialogue. ST went on to explain the rules that I had to play by when running Jalees, and when running anyone else.\n\nAs Jalees went around introducing himself, one of the players from another group recognized the name, and asked a fair load of questions regarding the stories and verified that I am indeed the author and player. He was quite fervent that I should be allowed to play following that - though I made sure to explain that there would be a lot less plotting and backstabbing of player characters this time.\n\nHe didn’t mind.\n\nAfter that the players settled down and the game started. There were many, many poorly made or poorly played characters at that game. Combat-monster Brujah and Toreador that just wanted to hit things, “crazy” Malkavians that only remembered their derangements when convenient or funny, “creepy, genderless, otherworldly” Tzimisce and “dark and brooding, master manipulator” Ventrue and Lasombra. So many overdone cliches. Distasteful.\n\nI remember that a majority of my thoughts turned to plotting the death of pretty much every character as I met them. I lamented that I had so many points, so much power, and not the ability to use any of it with ease. I put the thoughts of PC-killing out of my mind, and focused instead on creating a chart of the character in play. I was able to create a thoroughly detailed dossier on most of them in attendance that night, and a realization dawned: I had been wrong.\n\nAt first I thought my friend ST had played a cruel and terrible joke upon me, inviting me to a game with so many overdone cliche characters. As the night wore on, I realized that the players were fully conscious of the kinds of characters that they were playing. A majority of them had chosen cliches that they had seen plenty of times before, but never had a chance to play. The players had all chosen to play their cliches turned up to 11: The Malkavians were always one sort of batshit or another - most had two or three derangements they cycled through during a session, the two Tremere were hyper-secretive about who got to witness them using Thaumaturgy - and most of those who did ended up with a carefully edited memory when the Tremere inevitably changed their minds, the Lasombra and Ventrue warred with influence and money in the shadows while putting up a front of Clan and Sect unity. Every player was in full Sabbat mode, as well - political lines of Ultra-Conservative, Moderates and Loyalists had been drawn and each character had chosen a side. \n\nThe most important thing, however, was that they played horribly cliched characters without being bad players, or having uncooperative characters. I later learned at afters - where the group hits up a local diner for food after the 6-8 hour zoo game (depends on when dusk is) - that all of the characters had signed a contract affirming that the defense of the Sabbat as a whole held higher priority than any internal politics or disagreements. Putting aside differences to defend from an outside threat was more important than who fed from someone else’s territory last week. Most of the Clans had a similar contract, so the order of importance ended up being something like: Sabbat, Clan, Political Faction, Self.\n\nThey had a physical contract as well, that all of the characters had to sign to be accepted into the city for more than a few weeks. The contents of the contract were suitably legalese sounding sentences that didn’t really say anything, while an out of character reference was handed out to everyone as to what the contract meant and what the rules were. In addition, it had the group’s social contract, which the player was required to sign. This went a long way in assuaging my fears of playing in a terrible game, and I was able to enjoy myself the rest of the night. I did end up signing the social contract, which detailed what sort of things were acceptable, what sort of justifications that character actions should have - none of that “well, that’s what my character would do” bullshit - and how issues would be handled between game groups and the STs. It was pretty good, though I pointed out a few (intentional, I was told) holes.\n\nI learned of the existence of the character contract during the game, however. Naturally, Jalees and his column had neither seen nor signed any such contract. This had a predictably negative impact upon his social interactions that night, especially when he implied that neither he nor any of his column had any intention of signing such a thing, even had it been requested - or demanded, for that matter. There was no shortage of outrage and threats after that, both to Jalees’ face and to the Archbishop. The Archbishop, having had encounters with the Black Hand before, invited Jalees to lead a demonstration of “the might of the Black Hand”. Jalees declined gracefully, and instead offered to hold courses on “The public history of the Hand”, “The mission of the hand”, and “Games of the Sabbat”.\n\n“In fact,” Jalees said, “we should hold a Game right now. Yes, I think would should play a Game of Instinct right now.” The Archbishop, knowing better than to question a Dominion’s judgement, agreed immediately, and sent for the Ducti. He, Jalees and most of the Ducti discussed which game should be played, and finally settled on ‘Capture the Ductus’. Jalees told them to prepare teams of four or five (not including the Ductus), and he would prepare his five people.\n\nThat garnered him some looks. The rules were simple: don’t alert the humans, don’t kill any Brother or Sister of the Sabbat, and capture either a majority of the Ducti, or Jalees. The other Ducti looked at Jalees like he was crazy for only sending in one team to defend him. All of the players knew Jalees couldn’t outright attack them, just as they knew that this sheet was absolutely loaded. Jalees nodded and said “Yes, you’re right, but please indulge me.” He took a moment to do a bit of invisible Thaumaturgy to determine what the lowest generation of his opponents was - 8th generation - and self-limited to match - maximum of 5 dots in any trait.\n\nIt still wasn’t even close to fair.",

        "text": "I've played video games for 25-ish years, but just recently started venturing into the world of tabletop gaming. My group of friends have been interested in D&amp;D, but since we don't have anyone experienced in the game to GM, we've been too scared to attempt it.\n\nEnter \"The Legend of Drizzt\", a board game with a D&amp;D-light atmosphere with tiles, dice, cards and figurines aplenty. We figured it was the perfect start to our tabletop journey. After spending around 2 hours reading the rule manual from front-to-back and playing the first solo adventure, I invited my buddy over to play the second adventure in the rulebook.\n\nLet me lay the scene:\n\nThe scenario calls for your heroes to search out the broken door, which is hidden in the tile deck. As you explore, you place monsters, resolve encounters, and place more tiles until you find the broken door. Once this happens, the villain, Artemis, appears on the board.\n\nI choose Cattie-Brie (I love long-range attacks), and my friend chooses Drizzt (he prefers close-range combat). We move, place tiles, and fight every monster that pops up. We're paranoid about having too many on the board, so we travel as a pack, exploring and eliminating as we go, never more than 2 tiles from each other in case backup is necessary.\n\nThe game is tough; we keep drawing the tough baddies, and our rolls for ourselves are just getting us through by the thinnest of margins. My buddy draws a Drider... great. For those who haven't played, the Drider has a decent amount of health, and hits fairly hard. On top of that, when your turn is resolved, you pass it to the next person in line, and then THEY have to resolve that as well in addition to any other monsters. \n\nThis Drider DEVASTATES us. Our rolls are weak, and I'm starting to lose hope. We've used all our healing surges (bring your characters back in if health goes to 0), and FINALLY I roll a natural 20 to defeat it, also nabbing myself a level at the same time.\n\nSo here we are, both down to around 2 health, no items, and we haven't even found the broken door tile to trigger the final boss. My friend starts his turn and draws... the broken door. Artemis hits the map 1 tile from my location. Cattie-Brie's advantage is long-range attacks. Artemis moves to the closest hero for short-range attacks. I'm screwed. He attacks, and misses. Safe for the time-being.\n\nOn my turn I run like hell, getting away just enough to make Drizzt the target for Artemis. I attack from two tiles away. *Thunk* the attack lands. Artemis is now about 8 health points from going down. We might win this one!\n\nDrizzt closes the distance and rolls... poorly. He connects once for 2 damage. Definitely bad considering he's allowed to make two attacks per turn. Artemis attacks... misses. We're both on the edge of our seats at this point. The game could definitely end poorly for us, especially given how far we've come.\n\nI attack. *Thunk* It connects. We're two good rolls from Drizzt being able to tear this guy down. Artemis attacks Drizzt... and connects. Down to 1 health. \n\nIn nothing short of divine intervention, Drizzt attacks immediately, clearing both rolls handily. We rejoice, breathing a sigh of relief and chugging our beers. Not bad for a first adventure. \n\nAs I'm packing up the tiles, putting figurines in their little baggies, and collecting cards, my buddy picks up the treasure deck and says, \"Man, this thing is kind of worthless, isn't it?\"\n\nWe defeated a ton of monsters and forgot to draw treasure cards afterwards. Those cards contain items that help you through the adventure. We played an entire adventure... full of stress and impending doom... forgetting to draw treasure cards. \n\n\"Whoops... forgot about that...\"",

        "text": "In the unfathomable depths of Subnautica there lurks a monster. I am writing this to spare you from the time and pain of finding it. For those of you who don't know Subnautica is a game about exploring the depths of a underwater alien planet. Anyway as I was swimming I encountered a huge island I thought that was cool cause I had not seen it before. After exploring the island I got board and decided to try something new. I decided to go as far down as I could into the crushing depths to see if it ended. It is also important to note that the ocean floor after going in any one direction for a while drops suddenly into the depths. How far it goes no one knows. First I left the island and swam south away from the island for about ten minutes. \nI than decided to turn around to look at the ship. It was no were to be seen I had swam so far all I could see was endless water and the last light of the sun as night set in. I than began my dive luckily I had tons of batteries for my SeaGlide and then there's always cheats if I needed more. As I descended into the depths it became darker and darker the farther I went down which is normal but unnerving nevertheless. At around 43,000 meters I stopped unnerved  how far I had gone I felt strangely alone in this unending darkness. After a few minutes I continued my descent with resolve losing all track of time. Down and down I went for how long I do not know. After 800,052 meters\nI noticed something strange my depth gauge stopped working and only stayed on 800,052. I have never seen that glitch before but it did not surprise me as I doubt many people have gone down that far. After using a cheat to refill my batteries I continued down into the unending abyss. After five minutes about Something odd happened the music abruptly stopped and after ten seconds a haunted mournful melody started playing that I had never heard. I swam horizontally for a while to see if I could find something. I found nothing however I did find out that the haunted melody only plays in a certain area and will stop if you swim to far away. After I swam back to were I left my beacon which is were I first heard the haunted melody I began to dive deeper into the depths. After seven minuets about something unnerving happened. The haunted melody suddenly stopped and all background sound stopped. I continued diving unnerved by the lack of all music and background sound and made the downward trek in total silence.\nAfter ten minutes of diving I noticed the bubbles abruptly stopped and all I could see was utter darkness.\nAs I went down even further I spun around wildly and lost all track of direction since there were no bubbles and my depth gauge was not working. After looking around I went in the direction I thought was down. As about fifteen minuets passed I was about to give up and quit when I heard it. The sound I hear was so unnerving I can only describe it as a low deep bubbly mournful wheezing moan. I was shocked that the developers would even bother putting a sea creature down this far but I decided to Investigate and swam towards the source of the noise. As I got closer the noise got louder and I started to imagine the most horrible sea monsters imaginable. Little did I know what I would see would be worse. After a little bit I noticed strange green balls of light glowing in the distance moving very strangely as if they were invisibly connected. As I got to the balls of light I watched them memorized. After about two minutes I decided to turn on my flashlight. Then I saw it. What I beheld was the most freakish abomination hideous beyond description. A huge mass of writhing tentacles squirmed around with millions of mouths all over them.\nA giant Bloodshot pulsating eye stared up at me. The creatures own bones jutted out of its mass of tentacles. I stared in horror at the abomination I beheld. What I thought were glowing balls of green lights were in fact glowing sacks on the ends of its tentacles that were not bright enough to illuminate the abomination with out a flashlight. The creature was giant it was far bigger than anything in Subnautica even the Cyclops your main sub was a minnow compared to it. Then I swam towards it. As I got closer to the thing it gave a wheezing mournful groan and its tentacles reached for me its giant eye pulsating faster its jutted out bones creaking from its movement. Then as the tentacles got closer something weird happened. The game started to jerk and go slow. It was running at like 2 frames per second. Then as the mouth covered tentacles got mere inches away the game froze. The I stared at the frozen image of the thing in all its freakishness. its giant eye seemed to be looking at me. I will never forget that image for as long as I will live. After I could take no more of the things frozen image I hit cntl alt del and went to task manager and hit end process on Subnautica. As the game force quit I could only guess as to why the thing is in subnautica. Perhaps the developers are testing a new creature down here and did not think anyone would find it.\nor perhaps it was a rejected creature they were going to add than changed there minds and left it down here were they thought no one would ever see it. It may even be a Easter egg. Also perhaps the reason the game froze was because the attack animations were never added so the game got a error when it was about to attack. Why it is in the game is a mystery but it is truly the most freakish thing I have ever seen. I have tried to find it again several times but I have so far been unsuccessful and I don't think I will again because of the time required to go down to that depth. If you wish to look for The Thing I wish you luck just remember what is seen can not be unseen.\n",

        "text": "While the D&amp;D campaign of The Glorious Chucklefucks builds toward its glorious conclusion at the end of this summer, I have started up a new game with some other friends of Demon: The Fallen. We've decided to set it in World War II, simply because the prospect of being demonic Nazi-hunters appealed to all of us.\n\nThe story begins in a Bavarian work camp in the days leading up to the war. Our motley crew consists of: Sofiel, a demon whose powers center around nature and communion with animals, and whose human host was a young girl from a rural village who was kidnapped and taken to the camp by a German officer fixated on her beauty; Zvaid, a fallen angel of death responsible for the creation of dreams before the revolt against Heaven, in possession of a human host who, lost in despair, begged for death to take him, not expecting his request to be granted so literally; a demon whose name I cannot recall and who shall henceforth be called Jeff, with power over portals and limited precognition, whose host was a gypsy who conducted what he thought was a phony ritual meant to invite a demon to enter his body, a ritual which succeeded beautifully; myself, a demon named Anduriel who shapes and manipulates mortal flesh, inhabiting one of a pair of twin brothers whose soul was weakened by his inability to save his brother from the Nazis; and Bombadio, an incubus who, before his Fall, personally invented ambition during the Creation of humanity, and whose host was a Jehovah's witness who lost all faith in his god.\n\nEach of us begin our stories in the lowest points of our human hosts' lives, hence why their souls are weak enough for demons to possess them, with the exception of the gypsy, who basically just rolls out a red fucking carpet for his demon. Upon entering our new bodies, each of us decides to manifest in our Angelic forms and commence wrecking shit. Sofiel goes full Demonic and rips to shreds the bastards who were about to rape her, Zvaid goes outside and kills a motherfucker with a single touch, Jeff goes all spooky and phases through the back wall of the tent, while Bombadio basically declares himself the new savior of a bunch of Jehovah's witnesses. And Anduriel? He goes into his Angelic form too, but the thing is, he's about as tall as a house in this form. His head busts through the ceiling of the building he's in, and he commences wrecking some Nazi shit. Between the crashing through the ceiling and the shredded Nazi corpse he sends cartwheeling through the air across the camp, the other demons notice him and converge on his position after concluding their respective slaughters and reaping the Faith from driving a shit ton of gormless scrubs into Rapture with their mere divine presence.\n\nA jolly reunion is had, and a few of those gathered recognize Anduriel and Zvaid, as they were moderately famous among demons back in the day. But everyone immediately recognizes Bombadio; with five points in Eminence, this motherfucker is a demonic superstar, known by every Fallen in the world. Thing is, with one point in Legacy, he doesn't remember a damn thing about himself or any of us.\n\nOur group splits up again at this point as Bombadio goes off to start some shenanigans, trailed by Zvaid and Jeff, while Sofiel and Anduriel try to convince the brother of Anduriel's host that, despite the fact that he just witnessed his brother transform into a massive steel titan with wings and claws as long as a human forearm and then have a conversation with four other (literally) god-damned demons, he was still himself and could totally be trusted. The poor son of a bitch is not convinced, and becomes even less so when Anduriel tries to heal him and ends up causing him horrible, debilitating pain in the process.\n\nAfter that, our various endeavors are bumped a ways down on the priority list when the earth begins shaking violently. Moments later, a giant fuckoff metal death spider crawls up out of the ground. Our first session ended there, and I for one think this represents a fucking wonderful start.",

        "text": "I kinda don't want to do this one. I mean, I know I sort of indirectly said I would do this [last time](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/3b1cqr/the_kind_of_thing_that_belongs_on_an_album_cover/) but... I really don't want to do this. Two reasons mainly; the first is that it makes no one look good, we were all pretty terrible that night. The second is because I know the person responsible is probably reading this and laughing his ass off right now. He **STILL** has not apologized for this, just for the record. But, I've taken some medication and I'm pretty sure I won't have an aneurysm this time so let's give it a shot. And to the man responsible, I say this. You're a great guy, you're still my friend, but you're a fucking asshole.\n\nNames have been changed to protect even those who don't deserve it.\n\nThis all began when we were playing 4th edition D&amp;D when we were just starting out with actual tabletop games a few years back. The story was that we had come to a new country that was infested by a brood of chitinous monstrosities known only as the Blight and we were going around destroying nests and tossing ancient dwarven ruins. I don't remember much about my character except that I was an elven rogue.\n\nAnd then there was the man I call Cody. I'd like to point out that Cody has, in fact, [saved my life](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/38l276/bouncing_hellfire_a_story_of_magical_mishaps/) on [multiple occasions](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/36pxha/dd_5e_the_mostly_dead_battlemage_of_the_bleak/) before I continue. Cody was some race called a ~~hamydryad~~ ~~hammadryad~~ ~~homadryad?~~ ~~fuck it~~ he was a half-tree person. Would you like to know what this half-tree's weapon of choice was? Alchemist's fire. You can already tell where this is going. It gets better, he was a druid. The druid that was partially made of fucking leaves and wood enjoyed whipping around fire and burning everything. This guy....\n\nSo we eventually arrive at a new settlement, most of the group arriving on a flying worm while me and Jack's character arrived a few days later because we had to walk through the Blight-infested desert after falling off said flying worm (long story). We look at a map and pick the nearest Blight nest to go squash and loot as we had done a few other times by this point. We get there and start stomping bug monsters until we start seeing their gross webbing stuff on the floor and walls of nearby rooms. We had learned that that stuff was pretty flammable so we turned to our resident pyromaniac, the part-tree druid in case you forgot, to lob some fire in there and wipe out the whole room. Cody happily throws a bottle of alchemist's fire in as we close the door and continue down into the cave. This is where we all had fucked up. We forgot that basic safety procedure about smoke and fire and the logical solution if you flip it and reverse it. Smokey the Bear was rolling in his cremation urn. Well, I guess it would be more like a dust devil.\n\nWe continue killing our way through the cave when one of us speaks up with a \"Hey, is it getting hard to breath for anyone else?\" We look back and notice that the way we had took was filled with smoke and fire and was moving our way. We run further down, running right past a plethora of Blight as we try to get some literal breathing room. We ran past a spot of water that could lead outside but we were so far underground that there was no way we could hold our breath that long. We even ran right past the heart of the nest, a big glowing puss ball squeezing out new Blight like a assembly line, and continued down the one path we had left. This path turns out to be a dead end. Then the cave-in happened.\n\nRocks fell from the ceiling , trapping most of us in that tight dead end. The only one that avoided being trapped was Cody. Cody at first does the noble thing of helping us try to dig our way out. The Blight monsters being popped out were now closing in on him as he was digging. My guy was directly by the small opening that was left, furiously digging, when I notice that Cody's guy has stopped digging. I look up and he has the face of realization.\n\nYou see, **half-tree people only needed half as much oxygen to survive and could, therefore, hold their breath for twice as long**.\n\nHe left us there. He looked me dead in the eye, then turned away and ran for the pool of water. The last thing I saw was him sprinting in the opposite direction before more rocks came and blocked off the last of our light. He dives in to the water and starts swimming. And you know what? He manages to pull it off, barely. He washes up on shore a few hours later and comes back to his senses. He looks back at the cave entrance, smoke pouring from its maw. He thinks of helping those he had adventured with for the past few weeks. \n\nThen he turns right around and heads back for the settlement........... CIVBQ3OIB ZX;JNwekbscvSPU ZX BIPASFJVFsnj\n\nThese pills don't do shit.\n\nThe game stops for thirty whole minutes. We're all glaring at Cody, trying to make his head explode with our minds. And Cody, he's laughing like I've never heard him laugh before. For a half hour we're sitting there in near silence while this cock sucker is laughing like he was watching a mash-up of Monty Python, Bill Cosby, and the Three Stooges. He nearly chocked. The fucker nearly choked on his own laughter. We wait for him to finish, and then we continue playing. Cody eventually decides that he will come back for us. The ooc reason is because he knows we're going to strangle him if he doesn't, which makes him giggle. But the in game reason is that he remembered that  I was the one with the crafting ability and wanted me around to make more alchemist's fire. ~~I've never made or used an alchemist's fire since that night.~~ But first, he was still heading back to the settlement to get supplies.\n\nThis little shopping trip took an in-game total of **THREE DAYS**\n\nI want you to delve into the mindsets of those stuck in the cave. Imagine being stuck in a cramped space, no light left, food running low and your refuse in a corner, sitting there with your eyes closed, nothing but the words \"He left us to die in here\" ringing through your thoughts. **FOR THREE DAYS.** Now imagine what you would do when the light suddenly returns and the first face you see is the one responsible.\n\nAfter his supply run that took **THREE FUCKING DAYS**, Cody finally pushed his way back to the cave-in, the fire long dead, and was able to move all the rocks. Inside, he saw the faces of his party who all looked quietly at him for a few seconds, then immediately drew their weapons and dog-piled him.\n\nThe conversation pretty much went like this.\n\nUs- \"Give us one good reason not to kill you right now.\"\n\nCody- \"Well, you may want to deal with the Blight first.\"\n\nHe was right, hundreds of Blight monsters were skittering towards us. Our revenge would have to wait for a bit. So he channeled all of our built up fury for him onto the monsters, and we tore them apart. They dropped like flies, our righteous anger cleaving through them as quickly as possible so we could get to the real target of our vengeance. I myself ripped the core of the nest right off the wall, cut it into sushi pieces, then dumped the last of the alchemist's fire I had made onto the pieces. We had become the true monsters of this land.\n\nCody had planned on this. He waited for us to get all the catharsis we needed before smooth talking his way out murdering him. Ooc we really, REALLY wanted to kill him, but we still held onto enough of our morals to know not to do that sort of thing to a party member. So instead we punched his lights out, took all his stuff, and hogtied him to the back of our horse with nothing but his birthday suit on. He laughed the entire way back.\n\nIt's been at least three years since that fateful night. To this day, he still laughs when we bring it up. I guess you could say that I'm still salty about the whole thing but like I said, this story doesn't make anyone look good.\n\nLook, don't do this kind of thing to your party members and then laugh your stupid head off. I don't care if it's really freaking funny, they will remember it and they might do worse then occasionally call you an asshole because of it. Love thy neighbor, or however that book goes. Never finished it, had a strong opening but I kind of lost interest after the part with the plagues.\n\nMaybe next time I'll have a story that doesn't put me in a bad mood.",

        "text": "&gt; [Previously](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2h8xzq/vampiretm_john_randoms_revenge_glossary/)\n\nA friend of mine has roped me into playing some more Vampire the Masquerade - this time a Sabbat game using the 20th anniversary version. At the beginning, I was rather underwhelmed. He gave me a mook NPC to play for the first game, to introduce me to the players and allow me to read up on all of the rule changes. Then the Archbishop of the local Sabbat announced “I have been informed that a particularly well known Black Hand Assamite will be arriving in a few weeks, after he finishes cleaning up a problem in New York.” ST then reminded everyone that the entire North Eastern section of the country was Camarilla territory.\n\nAt this point, I looked at the Archbishop, and asked him, “This wouldn’t happen to be the leader of the Stacked Deck, would it?” He replied: “The same.”\n\nI look at ST, “Well, it just so happens that he already finished that assignment.” I reached into my bag for my folder of character sheets, and pulled out the fully statted sheet for one Jalees Kamel, Black Hand Dominion, ductus for the Stacked Deck column. I handed it to the ST, and he handed it back after a brief glimpse. “Oh, no,” ST said. “This is years out of date. You need at least this much more XP on this sheet.” He wrote a number and handed it back to me. I quirked an eyebrow. “At least that much?”\n\n“Any less and I’ll just hand it back to you again.”\n\nHe had written ‘400’.\n\nAt Minimum.\n\nI finished playing that session, and then hung around to chat with him about exactly what his intentions were for the character.\n\n&gt;ST: “Simple. He knows he’s been called in to deal with a three-fold problem: werewolves, mages, and heretics.”  \nMe: “Okay, but why him? More importantly, why the whole column? That’s another 50 vamps that need feeding and management.”  \n&gt;ST: “Oh, Jalees will have three rules on him. First, he can’t initiate any combat - defending himself is fine, and retaliating, sure, but he can’t be the first to roll dice for combat. Second, he can’t directly oppose or interfere with the other PCs and their plans. I fully expect you to rotate through at least 20 underlings that Jalees sends to handle things. Third, Jalees can have as many points on his sheet as you like, but he won’t gain any XP for showing up to sessions and hanging out. The underlings that he sends out will - full XP on each of them - but not Jalees.”\n&gt;Me: “So how does Jalees gain XP?”  \n&gt;ST: “He will have a list of goals to accomplish. It’s not an endless list, but it’s about 50 or 60 XP worth.”\n&gt;Me: “Can I add a goal?”  \n&gt;ST: “I guess.”  \n&gt;Me: “Jalees is searching for Golconda, the mythical lifting of the ‘curse of vampirism’.”  \n&gt;ST: laughs, “I knew you were crazy, but that’s a whole different level of madness.”  \n&gt;Me: “Hey, I have fun where I can. Finding a way for a lick on the Path of Honorable Accord to achieve Golconda sounds interesting, doesn’t it?”  \n&gt;ST: “I thought only Humanity vampires could achieve Golconda?”  \n&gt;Me: “Your call. Not really what I intended for the character, but sure.”  \n&gt;ST: “I’ve already given you a bunch of restrictions, I’ll let this one slide.”  \n\nAnd with that, the plan was set in motion. Every two or three weeks we play for 4-6 hours, and every fifth or sixth game is a ‘zoo game’, where all of the locals with currently running V20 Sabbat or Cam/Anarch games gather in a big group and do inter-game crap. ST said I could join, but the same rules would apply. It sounds like it might be fun.\n\nThe final sheet ended up being a complete monster, and it looked something like this:\n\nThe New Jalees\t| starting sheet\n--|--\nhighlights | Attributes 8, Abilities 8, Willpower 10, Generation 5\n[Disciplines](http://reference.l2fury.com/index.php/Disciplines) | Most Things 8, Vicisstude 5, Protean 6 (Earth Control), Obtenebration 7 (Shadowstep, Shadow Twin), Dementation 5, no Chimerstry, Necromancy or Thanatosis\n[Combo](http://www.scribd.com/doc/21091267/Revised-Guide-Vampire-Combo-Disciplines) | “As needed”, i.e. All eligible\n[Assamite Sorcery](http://reference.l2fury.com/index.php/Assamite_Sorcery) | All 5\n[Thaumaturgy](http://reference.l2fury.com/index.php/Thaumaturgy) |Lure of Flames 5, Path of Blood 5, Countermagic 6, Path of Mars 5\n[Koldunic Sorcery](http://reference.l2fury.com/index.php/Koldunic_Sorcery) | All 5, no Way of Sorrow\n[Rituals](http://reference.l2fury.com/index.php/Thaumaturgical_Countermagic) | Yes\n\nI am allowed to use the previous systems where necessary, though a couple of rolls changed. All of the new characters I use are fresh, though, and can’t be taught anything not in the updated rules.\n\nJalees, after his now wide spread victory over the Camarilla from my last set of tales, had made a name for himself by repeating the performance in not one Domain, not five Domains, but thirty Domains around the country, becoming somewhat of a Sabbat legend. His name was now a rallying cry for Sabbat all around the world, and just his appearance at a front was usually enough to turn the tide in the Sabbat’s favor, even if he did relatively little front line work.\n\nHis column had grown from the standard three groups of five into a sprawling ten groups, divided between two Captains he had selected. Both were a fully functional attack force in their own right, and neither had ever completely failed a mission. Most were relatively young, both as vampires and as members of the Black Hand, but they had all earned their marks, and been subjected to some fairly disturbing conflicts around the world.\n\nSecond game, I introduced Jalees and his column, as well as a couple of ghouls and one particularly long-lived ghoul, with a reputation almost as outlandish as Jaless’ own - Abdul-Shula, mother of three, loving wife, and absolutely not a ghoul to cross. She was reputed to have more confirmed vampire kills than the rest of the column combined. She didn’t, of course, unless Jalees himself wasn’t counted as part of the column.\n\nThe Archbishop greeted them, offered Jalees a haven for his group. Jalees thanked him, but assured him that his people had already secured several locations for use, and that they would try to have as a small of a footprint as they could, and to please alert him if anything ~weird~ was happening in the city.\n\nThe local Inquisitor greeted him, asked about things, lost the bit of witty exchange hard, and decided that it wasn’t his problem. Saying the Black Hand and the Inquisition got along ‘like oil and water’ is committing gross understatement - even saying ‘like Lithium and water’ isn’t close. They have deep, deep desires to always one-up the other, alway break cases before the other, and possibly kill the other in their sleep. This was probably the one and only civil conversation these two were ever going to have.\n\nThe Archbishop then reminded all gathered that all Sabbat had a responsibility and duty to help the Black Hand in any way they require, without expectation of recompense. He then directed Stacked Deck to the PCs, as they were the ones that had “discovered the plot that called you here”. The entire column gave their full attention to the PCs for about ten seconds, then turned back to the Archbishop.\n\nThis, naturally, caused a stirring of emotions in the PCs - ranging from ‘creeped out’ to full blown ‘paranoia’ and from ‘unease’ to downright ‘anxious’. \n\nThis was only the start of their problems.\n\nEdit: fix dialogue formatting",

        "text": "A little backstory before the actual tale of misadventure.\n\nIt was a fun little campaign among friends at my university and were a ragtag bunch of shady people doing work for a mysterious and powerful benefactor. The crew was comprised of the following:\n\n * Our captain; a goody two shoes who always tried to do the right thing. He was generally the face of our operation.\n\n * A mad monk; skilled at boxing, ballroom dancing and plumbing. He was actually one of the best in the group at hand to hand combat.\n\n * A psychopath who was our pilot and chef. No-one took any food from him though.\n\n *  Our doctor who was less than ethical. Think a cross between Medic in tf2 and Dr. Zed from Borderlands.\n\n * Myself, the grumpy and somewhat contradictory engineer with a torture spider fused with her spine. (This is relevant to the story.)\n\n * A hacker who was petrified of combat, she became fast friends with my character.\n\n * Our secondary pilot/captain who was always vying for control of the ship. She was also a violent misandrist. \n\n * A civilian who had bought passage with us and helped fund us, unbeknownst to the rest of the crew he was a reclusive and rich author. \n\n***\n\nOn with the story.\n\nWe were cruising along in our ship when we came across what we thought to be an Alliance ship (The corporate supergovernment of the firefly world) . It waylaid us and boarded us, four men in heavy armour were now in our ship and they were trying to kill us. Something to do with us trying to pretend to be the Alliance to stop them boarding us. The psychopath and myself went to the engine room to secure it, the monk and doctor stood their ground in medbay and the captain held the bridge. The doctor and monk successfully took two of the men down, tying them up and the captain took down a third. \n\nBelow in the engine room the psycopath had formulated a plan. Since I could fight by extending my spine from my back (because of the torture spider), I would surprise and stun any Alliance soldier who tried to get in and he would rush in and tie him up. Lo and behold, the doors opened and in walked a person in full Alliance armour, helmet and everything. I jumped out and rolled to attack with my spine, as I did so the GM had our captain roll something. My spine ends up knocking the man out and we tie him up.\n\nThe crew gathers together and takes the helmets off of the three men we had taken down. One of them was our captain. Without the rest of the party knowing, he had stripped the soldier he had taken down of his armour and put it on himself and headed down to help us. The GM had made him roll to dodge my spine. We talked it over and the doctor proposed we make the final man in our ship the new captain, we all agreed (bar the old captain) and we made contact with him.\n\nThe man, who we now knew was called Atticus Tuttle, was hesitant at first. He revealed that he wasn't actually with the Alliance, rather he and the other men had been hired to test us by our benefactor. (While we were talking the crew was also debating whether or not to toss the old captain out the airlock. We didn't.) The doctor made a roll to see if he could convince him, natural 20. Our GM sighed and rolled to see if Atticus could \"resist\", 1.\n\nAtticus was now our captain.\n\nI got the ship up and running again and we set off. We were almost immediately caught by the real Alliance, drugged, and taken to one of their large city-ship detention centre things.\nWe all woke up in our cells, which the hacker got us out of via the computer locks. The facility was now abandoned, ravaged by a viral plague (Which is a story for another day). \n\nAtticus, as our new captain, led us down a dark corridor. Out of no-where an infected... thing jumped from the shadows and landed on Atticus, tearing into him. We managed to kill it but it was too late, our dear captain was dead. \n\n\nWe all managed to escape back to our ship, and in his honour we made the \"Atticus Tuttle memorial Zen garden\" aboard our ship.\n\n***\n\n\nThat was how we gained and lost a new captain.\n\nOur crew had many other adventures, including cheating our way to the top of an illegal fighting tournament and accidentally blowing up a town.",

        "text": "A while back, I was GMing a gestalt game. This game was was fairly high level, I believe the PCs were around level 12-13. As many of you may know, this means that the rulebook goes out the window when it comes to CRs. This, in turn, means the GM has to come up with a bunch of custom enemies. Add to that, the PCs basically have “do whatever I want and get away with it” badges from the local government(think Spectres from Mass Effect). Apparently, I'm a masochist. \n\nAnyway, one day the story leads them to this town whose outer gate is getting beat on by a shard slag(think molten metal ooze). After fending it off and being thanked by the townsfolk, they're asked to investigate. This is easy, since these things carved a burnt trail through the forest. After a while, they follow it to a well known casino city – my setting's equivalent of Las Vegas. Only, something isn't right. Buildings are half torn down, others are boarded up, bodies and debris litter the streets. The place looks like a war zone once they get past the unmanned, half burnt down gates. \n\nA few minutes of wandering later, the party hears the sound of battle! Following the sounds a block or two over, they come across a fight between a couple of people wearing the same shiny badges the PCs have and Skivver. They arrive just in time to have front row seats to him brutally murdering their colleagues with his staff and cackle maniacally. \n\nThis gives them a moment to get a good look at him: A ratfolk wearing old samurai armor that looks as if it will fall apart at any moment, dirty and stained with who-know-what, wearing a dragon-like mask in similar condition, and sheathed in thorns and blue flames. Various bugs weave in and out of the armor, agitated but seemingly at home on Skivver's body.\n\nInitiative is rolled, and the party comes in hard. Luckily for the party, our villain was too busy admiring his handiwork to notice the clusterfuck of pain coming down the street at him. Unfortunately, the party a started their initiative too far back to get in range in one turn, though, and they weren't trying to be stealthy, so he was able to prepare for the fight. The party learned a couple of things from this fight:\n\nAfter spending some time fighting the PCs, his HP finally gets low, and the ratfolk lets out an earsplittingly high pitched screech. This brought the attention of several creatures the party didn't recognize out of several of the surrounding buildings. These creatures were humanoid, had little to no skin, large insectoid legs protruding from their back and up over their shoulders, and were incredibly quick. While the party put them down relatively efficiently(but not without incident), the ensuing chaos was enough for them to see just how fast Skivver could sprint away...which was faster than any of them could to catch him before he burrowed into the ground and left. \n\nAfter the PCs finished the fight, looted bodies what gear that wasn't broken, and collected their colleagues' badges, they went to find the burn trail(that lead them there in the first place) again and find its source. Turns out, it was a group of survivors holed up in a warehouse they had fortified. A little convincing later, the party had a place to sleep for the evening. \n\nWhile on watch that night, they heard the sounds of some explosions several blocks away. So they decided to go check it out. They found Skivver, again, dancing the streets while a few of the buldings around him burnt. More of those insectoid-zombie-men loitering about as well. While the party could have left, they were still feeling slighted from the previous encounter. So this time, they decided to charge in, guns blazing, again. This time, however, Skivver has had a chance to rest and resupply. Many of his buffs are fresh, he's full on health, and has a lot of his tricks back up his sleeve. \n\nThe party engages, and immediately, Skivver opens with a salvo of greater plague bombs, nailing most of the party with not only the explosion, but magical diseases. Fast Bombs discovery with a Fighter's BAB is a bitch(gestalt game, remember?). He also doubles down on the bombs, using the Viper Bomb Admixture, making the bombs extra-hurty and poisonous as well. Lots of insectoid-zombie-men, mixed success fortitude saves, and burrowing later, Skivver is starting to see that this is a fight he underestimated. \n\nSo he decides to run again. Only, this time, he doesn't have any back-up to distract the party. So he begins burrowing. Unfortunately for him, the group prepared for this eventuality – the party sorcerer/oracle had the spell slots to blow on elemental form for both himself and his animal companion. Morphing into earth elementals, they burrowed after him. After a short chase, they end up in the city sewers through a hole in the stone walls. The rest of the party pulls some dimension-door/abundant step fuckery that I don't remember the specifics of. Point is, they were all in the sewers now, and the chase was still on. \n\nThe confines, twisting turns, and general terrain hazards of the sewers let the PCs catch up. Lucky for Skivver, however, it was fairly close quarters. Close enough, in fact, that he could pull out a special trick he had been saving – the Caging Bomb Admixture. One of those slung after a few plague bombs, and the party was blocked from continued pursuit. After it wore off, the party searched around a bit, but due to some good rolls on Skivver's part for covering his tracks and bad rolls on the party's part for trying to track him, they eventually had to give up. \n\nA bit of story later, the party finds a way to end the insectoid-zombie-man mini-apocalypse that's happening. It also doesn't take a huge leap to figure out that Skivver was responsible for it. Having taken smart precautions after the second incident with the ratfolk they've come to hate, using the macguffin to turn the insectoid-zombie-men back into people(mostly) goes off with little incident. This is when Skivver comes to find them. \n\nSee, the previous couple of times, he had been just fucking around and they ruined his fun. Now they've ruined his work, and it's time for some revenge. Once the macguffin is drained, the party peeks out of the building they were using it in and spots not one, but two Skivvers(Twin Form, if you're wondering) standing there, obviously fully buffed, and looking pretty pissed. \n\nJust as the party monk/ninja is opening the door, Skivver opens with a full salvo of shaped demolition charges across the front of the building. Little damage is dealt to the party, but the building itself is in shambles and on fire at this point; they have to get out or it's going to come down on their heads. The ensuing fight consisted of every dirty trick Skivver knew. \n\nThe fighter/ranger lizard man fell during the fight: he had taken damage from the shaped demolition charges, then taken more damage from Skivver's defensive spells when he attacked, then ate a full four shaped bomb rotation at point blank range. Some good rolls from Skivver completely voided the PC's health pool. \n\nThe rest of the party came close, but stayed spread out enough that he didn't get many more full-attacks off, add some unlucky rolls for the villain and he eventually fell. Searching his corpse revealed a link to the campaign's BBEG. \n\nOf course, what the party didn't find was Skivver's cloning lab...\n\nAfter the arc was over, I asked the players what they thought. It was a unanimous “FUCK THAT GUY” but they enjoyed it thoroughly. \n\nIf you guys want, I can give more specifics about the PC's side of the story and/or Skivver's stats/inspiration.",

        "text": "Okay, so this chapter is wildly, wildly out of order, coming quite a while after the events in the prologue I posted, but still only in the middle of the campaign itself. I was planning on advancing in a more chronological order, but I had a few requests from party members to do this one. A good while has passed since the prologue (A Beginning In The End of Everything, see the telltalebot link) and the necromancy infestation on the island nation we fled in that chapter has mostly finished taking over the island. The party learned that the last remaining survivors were being rounded up for execution and raising, and we decided to do something about it.\n\nOh, and by this point we'd constructed an airship and armored it with walls of force. This will matter shortly. Also, this was a massively high-priority operation for us, so we were burning resources and favors and contacts and gold like they were so much tinder. This was a very high-magic game, but the GM was totally unafraid of throwing really NASTY shit at us on the assumption that we would find a way to handle it. She was never wrong about that, although this particular chapter saw her come uncomfortably close...\n\nCast:\n\n* Darren Living - Wizard, narrator\n* Tristania - Inquisitor\n* Kalina - Paladin\n* Karina - Rogue\n* Robert Coffee - Cleric. Don't ask.\n\n__________________\n\nFrom the writings of Darren Living.\n\nWe approached the shore during the early afternoon. I would have preferred a nighttime assault for reasons of stealth, but we were on the clock. Delays meant deaths and then, subsequently, undeaths. Ahead, I could just make out movement on and past the beach. Survivors, I hoped, or this would be the shortest rescue mission in history. Below and behind us, I could see the gaggle of mismatched seafaring vessels we'd hired for the evacuation, sailing towards a sandy beach with nothing even approaching a pier in sight. Trying to board hundreds of panicked civilians in a short time frame by rowboat would be terminally slow in the most literal of senses.\n\nFortunately, we had planned around that.\n\nThe shadow of our own ship swept over the beach, the 'stormcloud' shielding it from sight dissipating even as I hopped the railing and plummeted from the sight of my comrades. It was nothing they hadn't seen dozens of times before as tightly-channeled currents of air caught me, bore me forwards and down closer to the sand. Figures began to stream onto the beach from the treeline beyond, close enough for me to see that they were still alive. Mostly human with a sprinkling of a few other races, but that day that wasn't a relevant concern. They were alive, which meant that we weren't too late and that I could withhold the battle-magics that a sudden offensive by the undead would have called for.\n\nSo far, everything was going to plan. That worried me. Nothing ever goes to plan for long; reality isn't that accommodating. Below me, our ship turned broadside on and grounded in the sand, the barely-visible walls of force that formed its true armour digging into the sand as it settled. Behind me, the earth started to rumble and the sea to churn as the geomancers aboard the first wave of rescue vessels worked their own magic, dragging walls of solid stone up from beneath the seabed. Walls that radiated out from the beach into deeper water. Wide walls. Piers, in fact, rising into place just before the ships scraped up against them.\n\nThe survivors needed no more direction than that; in the space of minutes, they'd gone from being trapped rats pushed up against the water's edge to staring at a functioning sealift operation ready to carry them to safety. I can only imagine the emotional reactions, both because I wasn't in their boots, and because I didn't have time to interview anyone on the subject.\n\nBecause just as the first ships began to take on passengers, something else began to cross the treeline. These were not more survivors. These were no longer alive. We had, of course, planned for this as well. One does not attempt an evacuation from an island nation infested with an army of the undead without expecting to fight the undead.\n\nThe first order of the day was to secure the flanks. All the legionslaying sorcery in the world would do no good at all if the advancing forces were able to fall on the mob of survivors packed around the piers. Accordingly, more temporary fortifications; planes of shimmering force cut across the beach, digging furrows in the sand and extending out to sea far enough to discourage attempts to encircle our position in the short term. In the long term, well, walls of force don't last long enough for there to be a relevant long term.\n\nWe left a gap, of course. Left to their own devices, most undead are crude at best. Presented with a seamless barrier, they would likely attempt to swarm over it, and they might even succeed. Presented with a gap between the panes of magical energy, however, they were as predictable as we had hoped, and there they met a cleric and a paladin of the god of death standing shoulder-to-shoulder.\n\nI regret to say that I cannot properly narrate their stand, two men against an army out of blackest nightmare, simply because my attention was swiftly drawn elsewhere. Emerging from the woods behind the vanguard were further undead, these ones towing wagons behind teams of skeletal hounds of some description. Cages on wheels, really, packed full of still-living prisoners.\n\nPrisoners that quite handily neutralized a great deal of my own ability to devastate entire swathes of field armies myself, among other things. Now there were pockets of survivors scattered around the field of battle, people who needed rescuing, who were beyond the ephemeral walls around the site of the sealift, and people who were decidedly in the way of my own ability to spray ruin and devastation down on the battlefield. Frustrating, dangerous, something that required improvisation, all true, but swiftly overshadowed in all three departments by the last major facet of the developing battle to move into view.\n\nOur first warning, before we could even begin to find a way to move on the cage-wagons, was when the vegetation that made up the treeline itself began to die. Leaves shriveled and fell from branches. Vines simply blackened and dried into dead, fibrous ropes. Scrub brush wilted and browned, brittle twigs replacing supple stems. In the wake of that, it glided from the woods bare inches above the ground, a rictus grin of polished bone with two points of cold, blazing light in its empty eye sockets, a black robe wrapped around its figure.\n\nA lich, and a damned powerful one to project an aura like that simply by existing.\n\nThat changed the character of the battle in a heartbeat. With that kind of arcane support, walls of force would not be able to stand. We could no longer stand on the defensive and wait, even if the presence of the caged prisoners hadn't forced our hand already. If we left that lich to its own devices, it would either kill us itself, or tear us down until its army could do the job. Retreat wasn't an option, both for ethical reasons and, frankly, because there's little chance we could get away quickly enough without abandoning the ship and any number of allies.\n\nThat left only one option, and so our reserves deployed. Karina grabbed Tristania by the arm, triggered a wand of Dimension Door, and hand-delivered the judgement of Kelemvor to the lich's face. What you have to understand about Tristania is that she was (and is) uncompromisingly martial, By the time the lich could even register this sudden turn of events, it had a violent-spinning scythe attempting to occupy a number of spaces that were already claimed by its own body.\n\nAt the same time, I was in the process of learning a nearly-fatal lesson about this particular lich, one that I made a quite extensive project out of compensating for in later days. I suppose it is something of a spoiler to say that, but anyone with any knowledge of lichdom at all will be familiar with the fact that a lich is, shall we say, exceedingly unlikely to carry its own phylactery onto the field of battle. The very best we could hope to do is inconvenience it for a few days or weeks. Regardless, again, I'm getting ahead of myself.\n\nWith Tristania engaged in close combat against the lich, more wide-ranging battle-magic was out of the question. Precision was called for. Accordingly, a pale green beam leapt from my outstretched finger, streaming down and across the battlefield then back up and across the battlefield. My own defenses, even augmented by the blessings of my compatriots, were barely sufficient to turn aside my own disintegration beam as it rebounded off an as-yet-undetected defensive ward. I never wish to come so close to turning my own torso into a sifting of fine sand again.\n\nMeanwhile, however, Tristania was having much better luck, landing blow after blow on the skeletal mage. Its robe in tatters, shattered bones gleaming in the light, it reached into a pouch, withdrew a beautifully-cut, fat diamond, and crushed it in one bony hand.\n\nAnd the lich's half-broken body was made whole again in an instant. It's at that point that all of us began to realize how violently outclassed we truly were. Tristania hadn't escaped the lich's attentions unscathed, and now it had simply redacted the damage she had inflicted on it in a single moment. Karina, however, was waving me down, and I dropped to the deck of our ship where she'd returned to after delivering Tristania. She hissed a few words, I grinned, and we both vanished as I triggered my own teleportation spell.\n\nWe reappeared directly behind the lich. Karina slide by to one side, and then streaked off back towards the ship under the impetus of a flight spell. The lich prepared to cast another spell. The lich did not cast another spell. The lich looked confused. The lich...\n\n...could not find its spell component pouch. When all the rest of us were staring at its suddenly-undamaged frame, Karina had been thinking 'so that's where it keeps its spell components' after watching its elaborate show of drawing out the diamond and destroying it. As a result, the lich's spell component pouch was now on the deck of our airship.\n\n&gt;And at that point the GM had to call a pause in the game as she ran through the lich's spell list to figure out what spells it had that did NOT have a material component. As you might imagine, we went a little bit crazy at this point, laughing our asses off.\n\nThe rest of the battle was far less eventful. The lich wasn't helpless, but it was crippled without the access to much of its magic. It still managed to banish Tristania to an endless maze-dimension for a short time and make itself otherwise obnoxious, but before long both it and its armies were broken and destroyed. Kalina and Robert held the gap in the force-walls successfully, standing off an entire army of undead abominations to give the survivors time to evacuate and the rest of us time to deal with the lich and its own escort. The cart-caged prisoners mostly survived, although a few perished in the fighting, and joined the other survivors on the evacuation ships.\n\nAs out own ship broke for the skies to watch over the flotilla's trip home, one thing was quote thoroughly certain, however: we would be seeing that lich again.\n\nAnd I would be *ready.*",

        "text": "*From my current game save of the 4x strategy-sandbox game [Distant Worlds: Universe](http://store.steampowered.com/app/261470/), I bring you a story about a civilizaiton fighting for survival in a ruthless galaxy of (mostly) hostile aliens. **Part 1*** \n\n**IN THE DARK FUTURE OF THE GALAXY THERE IS ONLY GENOCIDE, INTRIGUE AND PREJUDICE ^and ^war**\n\nThe year is 2191 Galactic, and the [Minusot Galaxy](http://i.imgur.com/52W36xE.jpg) has entered the Classic Age, emerging from a century in the strife-filled Age of Shadow. The once-great Pirate Clans of the galaxy have fallen into a state of weakness as their former prey, the many civilized galactic nationstates of the various species enhabiting the galaxy have developed significant military forces, building massive fleets and engaging in trade with each other. \n\nHowever, the cruelty of sentient races knows no bounds, as these [civilizations](http://i.imgur.com/HXB7KKP.jpg) have begun to continuously waged war against one another, forging alliances in the darkness of space and engaging in espionage and full on war. In the midst of the constant struggle for survival and prosperity, one particular species has formed the most powerful military in the galaxy; the [Ikkuro](http://i.imgur.com/VTAtVmo.jpg) of the [Ivar Imperium](http://i.imgur.com/enMudoJ.jpg). \n\nDespite being new to the galactic \"community\", the Ivar Imperium has quickly risen to become a significant power in the center of the galaxy, primarily by subjegating its weaker neighbors and forging an alliance with the human [Soviet Union](http://i.imgur.com/4acuxJ8.jpg), a socialist human civilization that fled its former homeworld in a neighboring galaxy to establish its own \"socialist paradise\". Being a socialist government itself, the Ivar Imperium was more than happy to form a militaristic alliance with these humans. \n\nThe Imperium was always so strong however, as it was once a single world divided into multiple warring Great Houses, clans of Ikkuros who fought for resources and the glory of their gods. Around the galactic year 2149, an Ikkuro man named Mongst Hai united all of the Great Houses in a war to repel the [great enemy](http://i.imgur.com/pKvLkV5.jpg), Phaerax alien invaders known as the [Pantu Junction Supremacy](http://i.imgur.com/xlLKXtc.jpg). These invaders sought to conquer and colonize the Ikkuro's homeworld of  Vaasik, now named [Imperius](http://i.imgur.com/K9Rmd5b.jpg). \n\nRefusing to yield, the Ikkuro forces fended off the Supremacy's invasion forces, and were subsequently forced into unifying by [Mongst Hai](http://i.imgur.com/dB1t97i.jpg), thus ending the 300-year old feudal system by which the common people suffered. Now socialist and xenophobic, the Imperium spread out, assimilating many minor civilizations not yet fully developed and brutally [enslaving](http://i.imgur.com/wIki0kP.jpg) all non-Ikkuro species they encountered, beginning to engange openly in the [galactic slave trade](http://i.imgur.com/k8reVLG.jpg). Despite this, they forged an alliance with their fellow socialists, the Soviet Union of mankind, and waged multiple wars against their would-be conquerors, the Pantu Junction Supremacy, to which they succeeded each time in conquering more and more worlds and subsequently enslaving the Phaerax natives and establishing their own regime and garrison planetside. \n\n*(most of this actually happened in-game, the only part written for backstory is what came before the Ivar Imperium's emergence into galactic society, though I did use the in-game editor to make the Supremacy's demenor towards my Imperium -30 so things made sense, the alliance built with the soviet union was done manually with no help from the editor at all, same thing with the wars and everything else)*\n\nSeeking now to continue to grow it's military might to completely conquer the rest of the Pantu Junction Supremacy, the Ivar Imperium must continuously expand, exploit, and exterminate those that seek to bar its way to becoming the sole galactic superpower. Will it succeed? Will it fail? Probably the latter, but stick around to find out. \n\nEDIT: Sorry that the pictures kind of screwed up the format on some reddit clients, but I feel like the visuals really help with this story's telling.

        "text": "So I came up with this campaign idea after DMing my first game from the 4.0 Red box starter kit. The idea is that followers of the old death god, Nerull, are trying to perform a reincarnation by sacrificing thousands of citizens of an isolated country. The game is spread out into multiple campaigns of different encounters and quests that will eventually tie all together with Nerull being brought into the human world by a necromancer that has been manipulating them, for a final confrontation. Think Fullmetal Alchemist (Brotherhood for the anime watchers).\n\nThe party consists of an Elven Ranger from the north, her Bardic companion that uses her giant \"talents\" to distract men (and also keep track of the story by writing it down), a wandering Paladin with a tower shield trying to find his place in the world, an elven Cleric, and a second human Ranger bowman.\n\nThe country has a long history of bloody civil wars due to the conflicts of religion and the practices of magic. As a result; all mages must register with the government, and the use of any magic considered hostile or aggressive within the boundaries of cities controlled by the King is punishable by imprisonment or worse. Also areas of worship have been created to allow freedom to worship whomever and whenever. These neutral grounds are controlled by the Justicars; Paladins who have enlisted or are conscripted to enforce the law that no crime may be committed in the name of religion. Any crime in the name of religion is punishable by imprisonment and any acts of violence towards other people are punishable by death.\n \nThe first encounter brought the adventurers together in a town run by corrupt guards squandering the tax payers money on goods and services for themselves; the equivalent of the overweight guy who thinks he is good at paintball because he bought the most expensive one available and he played Call of Duty. \n\nThe group accepted a quest by the Lord of the keep, his stuttering servent, and his greasy head guard. The guard is a leader of the corrupt guards called the \"Legionaries\", identifiable by a shiny red pendant with a silver L around their neck. The group was asked to return the kidnapped daughter of the Lord, whom was taken in the night by his appointed mage. \n\nAfter asking around town, the group found out that the mage took the lady to a temple that used to be a front to worship old gods of death several hundred years ago. Entering the temple, they found a small group of goblins that they easily dispatched. After using a empty room as a decoy to get the group to go to the right, I utilized the Witch cry from L4D and told them it was coming from behind them; they returned to find a woman crying in front of the fireplace in the main chamber. After approaching and asking if she was the missing girl, she looked at them and whispered\n\"You're all going to die.\" \nShe snapped her fingers, the fire and lights went out, &amp; I tell them the only thing they could hear is the sound of ragged, gurgling breathing; accompanied by zombie sound effects.\n\nPart two &amp; three will be available later if people want to know more. The group is about to realize the consequences of interrupting a summoning ritual.",

        "text": "Slight background, this details a mid-level-and-up Pathfinder campaign taking place in an original setting but using Forgotten Realms deities because fuck it, the pantheon works). The party consists of a Cleric, a Paladin, a Rogue, an archer of some description (he fucked off fairly early on, so I don't even remember precisely what he was), an Inquisitor, and myself, a Wizard named Darren Living. The Paladin, the Cleric, the Inquisitor, and I were all Kelemvor-worshippers, something that just sort of happened on its own, but the GM decided to roll with and ended up fairly central in some events going forwards. My wizard was particularly devout due to pre-game background stuff, and had a triple-helping of the typical Kelemvorite hatred of the undead.\n__________________\n\nFrom the writings of Darren Living.\n\nThe undead overran Lathandar's strongerholds before anyone even realized what was going on. In hindsight, unsurprising, but the Morninglord's adherents would have been most welcome in the days that followed. Still, their deaths bought time for the fortress-temple of Kelemvor to firm up its defenses, and as that's where my own involvement in this tale begins, I can't help but be thankful that we weren't first instead.\n\nConsider, for a moment, the kind of history a region has to possess for both Kelemvor and Lathandar to have literal fortresses in the same city. If the result of your consideration is something along the lines of 'necromancy has been a problem before,' you would be apocalyptically correct. It was, however, far enough in the past that we were not as prepared as we could have been, and a great many people paid with their lives and, indeed, souls for this failure.\n\nBut I'm getting ahead of myself.\n\nThe fortress held against the initial assaults, both physical and arcane, but the surrounding necropolis that had once been a port-city and the sheer mass of the deathless pressing in against it gave those of us defending it no illusions that that would continue to be true. Those of us with the senses to perceive it could easily detect at least three nexuses of impossibly-powerful necromantic power, mortal practitioners of overwhelming power at best, full-blown liches at worst; in either case they were nothing that we could stand against in anything like the long term.\n\nAll of us were being forced to come to terms with the prospect of a last stand, and one that would ultimately accomplish little. At best, we could hope that dying on consecrated ground would shield us from being raised by the enemy, but even that was uncertain. The first day had seen an attempt to take the gates in a rush, easily seen off by properly-prepared defenders. The second had born witness to an increasing frequency of poorly-organized attacks, wearing, but not particularly likely to succeed. All the whole, though, we watched the rest of the city fall around us, knowing full well that the increasing weight of attacks was the harbinger of something overwhelming.\n\nThe dawn of the third day brought with it two things that I, at least, did not anticipate. First, I and several of the fortress's other more potent defenders  were approached and requested to escort the civilians who'd taken refuge in the fortress-temple. A breakout attempt was in the cards somehow.\n\nSecondly, as we were making ready, the High Doomguide emerged from the temple's inner sanctum in full ceremonial regalia. I failed to realize the import of that fact until later, when it became impossible to ignore. Again, I challenge you to consider what it means when the senior ranking cleric of Kelemvor, in the middle of a localized necromantic apocalypse, hides away inside his chambers for two days, and then emerges in ceremonial robes on the eve of an attempted evacuation.\n\nIn any case, a diversionary attack from the main gates gave us our window, my own talents as an air wizard gave us all a safe, rapid descent down the opposite wall, and we ran. As tempted as I was to intervene myself, I knew my own limitations. Those limitations extended at the time to both armies of the undead and massively powerful necromancers (although that state of affairs has...evolved by the time I pen this account). And so we ran.\n\nI won't bore you with a blow-by-blow account of our fighting withdrawal across the half-burned, all-dead city. Suffice to say that it was not unopposed, but that the majority of forces of note were concentrated behind us, on the fortress-temple itself. Accordingly, some hours later, we were nearing the city docks when movement behind us caught our attention.\n\nRather than being the ambush we were half-expecting and all watching out for, it was something more distant. The fortress-temple of Kelemvor was... I am rarely at a loss for words, but I admit that I spent some time trying to come up with the right way to describe this. The closest I've been able to come is 'discorporating,' but even that demands additional explanation. It was built on the crest of a hill, so even across the city we could still watch as it slowly, ponderously separated into blocks, stones parting from one another and simply floating away. All of us with any sort of sense of the supernatural could feel the power being released, although none of us yet realized what we were looking at. I wasn't watching the others personally, but I'd be shocked if anyone so much as glanced away from the spectacle as the massive fortress floated apart from itself, blocks suspended in the air as they spread out.\n\nAnd at that point, we were nearly all blinded as, we worked out after the fact, the High Doomguide sacrificed himself, presumably some quantity of relics in the temple, the rest of the temple's surviving clergy, and indeed the temple itself, a focal point of worship for centuries, all to call on his god and mine for one final boon. I said we were all nearly blinded because as we watched, something, a beam or something very, very fast, it was hard to tell, descended from the sky on the fortress itself. Whatever it was was unspeakably bright and incomprehensibly destructive, and I use that word in the context of someone who makes it his business to comprehend all things destructive. By the time we could all see again, the temple was simply gone, as was the hill it stood on, as was a great deal of the city, as were the focuses of necromantic power that pointed to the leaders of the assault on the fortress. All that was left, then and now, was a shallow crater made of black glass, literally seared into the earth.\n\nWe...faced little effective opposition after that as we shepherded our refugees onto the last, half-derelict ship in port, effected some emergency repairs, and cast off.\n\nYou may have noted that I haven't named the city in question. Now, I think you may see why; after that day's events, we simply referred to the former site of the city as Kelemvor's Wrath. The name caught on.",

        "text": "First, I just want to say that we weren't ever really too serious when it came to RPGs, we messed and joked around a lot and got in to a lot of dumb situation. We still played the game right and completed many adventures and campaigns, but we usually decided to catapult a raging bear into the king's quarters and pretend it wasn't us before we \"went\" into town so we would have an excuse to look through his room while courageously getting rid of the bear. But anyways, here is one of my favorite RPG stories. \n\nWe were playing the Warhammer 40k Dark Heresy RPG, those of you who know it know that it is very grim and everything is dark and depressing. It was our third hand at trying out the game, we had done two one-offs with preset characters and this time we wanted to create and play a full campaign.\nSince it was our first time creating characters, it took us a while longer exploring the options and getting to know the rules. By the time we were all done, it was a bit too late in the night to really get into the campaign long enough to go further than introductions, so our DM gave us \"freetime\" a chance to explore the town and maybe do a small sidequest to get a few coins before we got underway the next time we met. \nWe decided to split into a couple of groups, a couple of us decided to go rob a nearby mob front that was manufacturing street drugs (group 1) the other group decided to mug someone who looked rich (group 2).\n\nGroup 1\nFinds the warehouse were they were shipping crates out. They do pretty well on their stealth rolls and get pretty far in. They decide to steal a whole crate of Stimm (allows you to ignore pain) One guy grabs it and goes, the Scum (stealth based character) decides to go a bit further in to see if he cant find anything valuable. He Crit Fails and alerts the whole warehouse. They book it, while getting chased and shot at by like 20 guys. The only reason he is able to make it out of there to regroup with the other guy is that as hes running hes shooting up with handfuls of the Stimm. \nThey manage to shake them but Scum is in really bad shape, missing a whole arm and a foot bad. He keeps shooting up with Stimm to stay alive. \n\nGroup 2\nGo to the market area and start scoping out a likely target. We see someone with some fancy clothes who's clearly not opposed to spending money. We follow him around a for a while and spot that he's actual got a couple of guys also tailing him but they seem like bodyguards. We decide to nab the three guys simultaneously. When they are on a pretty quiet street, we strike and kill the two guards and pull the noble into an alley. As we start asking him questions he starts crying and we knock him out. We start looting and undressing the guards and the noble, in his wallet we find out (by random DM roll) he's the Planet Governor's Eldest Son. Whoops.....\n\nAt this point, Group 1 calls us and tells us what happened. We hack into a nearby console to find a local doctor. It's pretty late at night at this point and we have a naked hogtied hostage and a crate of illicit drugs, so a hospital is out, we manage to follow the doctor to his house. We break in and confront him. We manage to intimidate him enough to attempt to heal the scum. He fails, and the scum dies. Another party member, enraged over the death of his friend murders the doctor. The party Tech Priest goes \"it would be a shame to let these skulls go to waste.\" He proceeds to decapitate the heads to prepare them for servoskulls. \nWe try to decide what to do and start interrogating the Son to see what kind of ransom we could get and if we could even get out of here with our lives. \nA few (in game) hours later and cops bust in the house after complains of noise by neighbors. They ambush and quickly subdue us.\n\nThey find a beaten up naked noble, two decapicated bodies in the kitchen, a crate of drugs and a techpriest boiling two heads upstairs.\n\nThe DM decides to give us a chance to avoid a TPK so soon. He decides to give us a sort of \"trial\" and asks each of individually about what happened. We get 45 seconds to come up with a story. Needless to say, none of our stories matched in even the smallest detail. Execution by firing squad at sunup.\n\nTPK three hours after character creation. ",

        "text": "There's a big party happening in the city of Megalopolis, to honor the heroes from the Freedom Six and other assorted teams. Into this party have arrived two new heroes.\n\nOur first hero is Torrent, who can send himself into machines, and create forcefields and projectiles from those forcefields. He works under the cosmic guardian known as the [Argent Adept](http://sotm.wdfiles.com/local--files/heroes:the-argent-adept/The%20Argent%20Adept.png), keeping the musical master appraised of any uprising of agents of chaos.\n\nThe other hero is Thunder Rose, with the powers of electrical generation, weather control and increased durability. These powers are extremely similar to one of the Freedom Six, by the name of [Tempest](http://sentinelsofthemultiverse.com/sites/sentinelsofthemultiverse.com/files/cards/images/Tempest%20splash.png). There's a good reason for this. Because of the different timelines being smashed together, Tempest's granddaughter has entered the modern era.\n\nWhile they're taking part in the food, both of them notice someone skulking around the outside of the party, trying to pick pockets. Rather than get caught in the crush of the crowd, Torrent creates a set of stairs from his forcefield, allowing him and Thunder Rose to reach the pickpocket in no time.\n\nTorrent gets to go first in the initiative, and uses a force field to lock down the pickpocket, who is revealed to be the devious [Ermine](http://sentinelsofthemultiverse.com/sites/sentinelsofthemultiverse.com/files/cards/images/Ermine.png). Then, on a  successful persuasion roll, he gets the super thief to reveal her plan.\n\nOf course, because Ermine doesn't know how to shut up, this takes about five minutes of rambling. But when the police officers finally arrive, she reveals she was here to steal the Gem of Magmaria, being held by one o the financial backers of the Freedom Six. She also lets it slip that other members of her team, the Vengeful Five, are here.\n\nOne of the police officers reveals himself to be the fourth-wall breaking hero known as [GUISE!](http://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/sentinels_guise_1739.jpg)\n (He made me write it in caps. Says it's more dramatic that way.)\n\nAfter making the dramatic reveal by casting away his cop's outfit and \"accidentally\" wearing nothing but his mask and a speedo underneath, he grabs the forcefield containing Ermine and stuffs it into a pocket dimension, which leads to the superpowered prison known as The Block.\n\nThis leaves Torrent and Thunder Rose to search the party for whoever has the Gemstone. After carrying on the search for a short time, they encounter the second member of the Vengeful Five.\n\nIt's the man behind the Iron Curtain, the fearsome one man army known as the [Proletariat!](http://sentinelsofthemultiverse.com/sites/sentinelsofthemultiverse.com/files/cards/images/Proletariat.png)\n\nHowever, after briefly fighting with Thunder Rose and Torrent, the Proletariat is beaten by his one true love. Thunder Rose promises him some good vodka if he gives himself up.\n\nWe're playing in the Ages system, used for Titansgrave and Dragon Age, so Thunder Rose rolls to Bargain with him, and rolls for a total of 17. Conversely, the Proletariat rolls for a grand total of 6 to counter her arguments.\n\nNot wanting to pass on Vodka, he surrenders, drawing his clones back into him. And the only thing damaged was the free bar.\n\nWhile walking down the detention level teleporters to the Block, they come across a bar with Guise behind it.\n\n\"Hey Guise, we need some vodka for our friend here.\" Thunder Rose says. \nGuise smiles and points to the shelves. \"We've got 'Shit Down Your Throat,' 'Blood of the Worker' and 'I Can't Believe It's Not Potato.'\"\n\n\"I've had too much of the first two. Give me 'Can't Believe.'\" Proletariat responds. With his booze in hand, he mentions that another member of the Five is here. The speedy [Friction!](http://sentinelsofthemultiverse.com/sites/sentinelsofthemultiverse.com/files/cards/images/Friction.png)\n\nTorrent decides to avoid a fight, and just transports himself into the smartphones in the party until he finds the one for Friction. There he discovers a file folder marked \"Why Won't She Love Me?\" and further examination reveals it to be very badly written fanfiction featuring Friction and the Freedom Six's speedster [Tachyon](http://sentinelsofthemultiverse.com/sites/sentinelsofthemultiverse.com/files/cards/images/Tachyon.png).\n\nKnowing that the best way to keep Friction from hurting anyone is to embarrass her, Torrent copies the files in that folder and emails them to Tachyon, who, in between giggle fits, reads off the most lewd and scientifically improbable parts of the fanfiction, *over the intercom.*\n\nThe beet-red speedster dashes out of the party, and the new heroes get to meet the legendary [Paul Parsons, AKA Legacy.](http://sentinelsofthemultiverse.com/sites/sentinelsofthemultiverse.com/files/cards/images/Legacy_0.png)\n\nLegacy informs them that they had been aware of the Five sending agents in to get the gem. Not that it would have done them any good. The investor holding the gem is holding a fake. But he gives them an induction to the superhero team, and gives them a mission to take the gem back to Magmaria, through the portal in Insula Primalis, also known as Dinosaur Island.\n\nIt's an uneventful meeting there, followed by a banquet in their honor. On their way out, they encounter a rampaging T-Rex, which Thunder Rose defeats with an epic display of calling her weather powers into the volcano to make blazing hail stones that incinerate the dinosaur.\n\nBut when they get back to Freedom Tower, everyone is gone. All the heroes, save for four. Guise, the team technopath [Unity](http://sentinelsofthemultiverse.com/sites/sentinelsofthemultiverse.com/files/cards/images/Unity.png), The world's most unlucky man, [Setback](http://sentinelsofthemultiverse.com/sites/sentinelsofthemultiverse.com/files/cards/images/Setback.png) and Paul Parson's daughter Paula, the [Newest Legacy] (http://sentinelsofthemultiverse.com/sites/sentinelsofthemultiverse.com/files/cards/images/Young%20Legacy.png}\n\nGuise informs them that everyone seems to have vanished, and that's when they hear what can only be described as maniacal giggling. The interdimensional gamemaster, known as the [Wager Master](http://www.thirstymeeples.co.uk/images/uploads/SOTMWagerMasterIN.jpg)\n\n\"It's time for another game. You new heroes, and whoever else shows up, have to trek across the dimensions to rescue the heroes of the world. If you win, you get them back and I leave your plane alone for six standard months. If you lose, they die and you die. Fun, right? You're going to Egypt first!\"\n\nThey fly out, with Torrent using his powers to control the Freedom Jet hands-free and land outside the TOMB OF ANUBIS! Upon entering, they are greeted by a statue of the Egyptian God that serves as a map guide. They're each allowed to ask one question of Anubis before proceeding.\n\nThunder Rose asks \"Who is the hero trapped here?\" and Anubis explains that he has been put in charge of [Haka.](http://sentinelsofthemultiverse.com/sites/sentinelsofthemultiverse.com/files/cards/images/Haka.png)\n\nTorrent gets to ask his question and he rolls three sixes on the dice. Using the house rule set up in TitansGrave, that means that not only is his communication roll a success, it's one that becomes legendary. His question is \"Has Wager Master's interference caused any problems with your Operating System?\"\n\nWhat was one question becomes a full conversation between Torrent of the God of the Underworld, with Torrent serving as superpowered tech support. Anubis' systems get upgraded to prevent interdimensional interference, and Torrent is added to Anbuis' book of awesome people. His image is carved into the walls of the tomb, showing him rewriting a scroll to cross out Wager Master's face.\n\nWhat was supposed to be a maze full of difficult fights becomes just a cakewalk, as the mummies inside put up a token resistance. They don't want to get on Anubis' bad side for harming his bro. Along the way, they encounter a robot scorpion, and Torrent collects the tail and claws as a present for Unity.\n\nThey finally reach Haka, who is chained between two clockworks. A forcefield goes up to protect him from the blasts, including the Rod of Anubis which projects dark energy. After beating he clockworks, the heroes get Haka back to the jet and he tells them \"You guys are going to have to go save the [Naturalist.](http://sentinelsofthemultiverse.com/sites/sentinelsofthemultiverse.com/files/cards/images/The%20Naturalist.png)\n\n\"Cool!

Suddenly this gluttonous orange monster, size of ~400, name of Pika, divides in half in an effort to consume me. \nThis is a remarkably common occurrence here in the grid, but this one was different. Normally, the slight snack of a glob my size wouldn't tempt anyone that large to weaken itself by division, but Pika smelled blood. I used all of my blob piloting skill as I too split, sacrificing half of myself, 30 of my hard won dots, to dodge the assault. \nMy attacker, unsatisfied with half, unthinkably splits again offering me no chance of escape this time, unfamiliar cell walls closing over me as my size is added to Pika's.\n\nMy next life was also taken by Pika. I was such a pretty yellow, size of 90, again cut short by the monster.\n\nMy frustration is given a form of it's own, as a brand new blue blob, name of Vengeance. Vengeance quickly gains size, as I consume the dots and the unwary alike, always searching for Pika. \nVengeance has a size of 300 by the time the offender is found, lurking on the bottom of the leader-board, as well as the top right of the grid. Pika is now two blobs, the smaller about 425, larger with a size over 900.\n \nBetween the two fragments of my foe there is a purple in great distress. Size of ~400, name of cxxxH========&gt;, I don't know if the bad-ascii-art-sword was lured in by the false hope of being large enough to eat the smaller of Pika's selves or if it had been forced there somehow, but things were not going well for cxxxH========&gt;, Pika waiting for the time when it can recombine the two halves, to surely devour the swordblob. \n\nThat is when I showed up. Vengance starts ejecting mass, as fast as I can press the w key, into cxxxH========&gt;. Swelling with the unexpected gift, it soon consumes the smaller, then the larger of Pika. Vengeance's size reduced very near to the 10 it started with, it dives into cxxxH========&gt;, life's purpose achieved. ",

        "text": "[Welcome back to my ~~fairly~~ completely erratic tales about my magical first Pathfinder campaign!](http://redd.it/36n9dy) When I last left off, I had introduced you all to the main villain of the piece- a completely reprehensible individual known as [Sleazeball](http://imgur.com/a/PM1j8), who was a former party member, amoral fuckbag, and powerful summoner. When we last saw him, his sternum had been torn out and devoured, and then he had been set on fire. How did he manage to survive, I hear you ask? By becoming a powerful lich, and sucking the life out of his eidolon! And now that he's gone full darkside, he completely stopped giving a shit about what flimsy morals he used to have, and started constructing an evil empire by killing people he didn't like (read: everyone) and using his freaky lich-powers to bind their souls into summoned monsters, extending the summon indefinitely. Thus, he had a practically inexhaustible army of undead T-rexes at his command, and his power only grew when he was accosted by a large military force (more souls to bind into T-rexes!).\n\nThis clearly had to stop. The ones who were tasked with stopping it: [the Buster Squad, a group of pseudo-mercenaries and player characters consisting of Pratena the cyclops murderchild, Thoth the shabti magus, Barrel the halfling rogue, Rose the dullahan ranger, and special guest star Fishnaut the gillman sorcerer who had returned from retirement just to lend a hand](http://imgur.com/a/I9chI). They were under the employ of the Asshole Patrol, an organization devoted to murdering assholes for fun, profit, and moral superiority, which currently had its hands full defending all the places they actually cared about while the T-rex armies stomped all over the place.\n\nIn our previous session, the Buster Squad had made a daring infiltration of an ancient temple populated by dullahans in order to get a powerful magical artifact that's super effective against summoned creatures. Next on their personal agenda was to visit a nearby forest where a powerful \"god\" was said to reside, and enlist said \"god\"'s help in healing the party's mentor, [who had been critically wounded by Sleazeball during an early confrontation](http://fav.me/d8rc4pt) (it's worth noting that healing magic is incredibly rare in my campaign). Well, that's not the subject of today's story, so suffice it to say that they entered the forest, got into a bitching match with the \"god\" about the nature of divinity, killed a few cultists and set fire to an abomination of rotting leaves animated by the tormented souls of dead plant life, got their mentor healed and seriously considered burning down the forest.\n\nBut now it was go-time. They had powerful magical artifacts, and more importantly, they had backup. Sleazeball's reign of... well, sleaze, had to be ended before anyone else died horribly. Thus, the party set off to once more murder their treacherous comrade.\n\nThe journey there was tense, but the party's way in was cleared by their allies at the Asshole Patrol, so that they would have their full strength for the final confrontation. Said confrontation took place in a seemingly abandoned town... well, it would have been more accurate to say it was a DEAD town. The eerie silence was broken by a sudden horde of reanimated corpses, seemingly summoned just to upset Rose, who was deathly afraid of the undead. The party responded to this by climbing up the nearby buildings and hucking various forms of death down onto the city streets until the zombies stopped moving. That done, they advanced on the one building that was NOT completely dark and silent- fittingly, it was a strip club.\n\nThe party (rather dubiously) entered the sinister strip club, which was filled to the brim with smoking hot demonic beauties. Now, at this point, every player's metagame senses kicked in and they remembered that Succubuses were on the list of summonable creatures, but curiously, the horned hookers didn't seem to have any supernatural charm to them. The party had to roll will saves versus thinking they were *pretty attractive*. When asked about this, the 'Succubi' were extremely defensive, evasive, and insistent that the party \"not ruin this gig\" for them. When someone pointed out that all demons (and thus succubi) were a completely dead race, the entire strip joint panicked and started making up explanations. With reluctance, the party concluded that there would be no sexy soul-sucking going on here.\n\nAnyway. More interesting was the fact that the bar was tended by a hulking amphibian creature in a tuxedo, and the bartender was serving drinks to a rather familiar face- that of Daloris, Sleazeball's eidolon, wife, and trusted confidant. She was getting shitfaced, and expressed only mild amusement that the party was there to put an end to Sleazeball. After some chatting, they discovered that she was extremely depressed, as her existence was pretty miserable now. She might have been very nearly emotionally dead, but being constantly sacrificed at the behest of your \"loving husband\" can do that to you. The party chatted with her, figuring that once they started shit, they would have to fight her, which would be unfortunate. Thus, they talked her into taking the easy way out- consenting to a Dismissal to her home plane.\n\nUnsurprisingly, this started shit. The bartender immediately vaulted over the drinks and started throwing slimy, poisonous punches while Pratena was taken unawares by a powerful sneak attack from Sleazeball's second favorite summon: [Contiferous the killer rat](http://imgur.com/EL5p0dU). Everyone else was rather astounded when some invisible obstacles in front of the bar turned out to be invisible Gorgons, who breathed petrifying breath at everyone. As for the \"succubi\", they immediately abandoned their fake horns and red body paint and dived under some convenient cover while the Buster Squad laid some serious hurt on the hostiles.Thunder bolts, flamy spears, punch flurries and sneak attacks reduced the enemies (and a large part of the bar) into a smouldering pile of ruin, but the Buster Squad had taken some damage from that one, and there was a clear time limit before Sleazeball managed to summon his eidolon once more. The party marched straight into the backroom, which turned out to be a portal to some weird and hellish place that Sleazeball was using as his own personal doom-fortress.\n\nSaid Doom-fortress was, of course, staffed. By more hulking amphibians, gorgons, and of course T-rexes. The Sleazeball himself was hunkered down at the far end of a long bridge (filled with summons, obviously), doing necromancer-y things to an ominous pit that was obviously writhing with tormented souls. Thus, the brilliant Cheesing of the Endboss was put into effect- Pratena and Rose faked having an incredibly hard time with the summoned monsters (Rose's AC was so godlike that the T-rexes couldn't touch her, and Pratena's punches could down a monster every round), while Thoth and Barrel turned invisible and used Overland Flight to go directly for the bossman himself.\n\nNow, I should mention- Sleazeball was a level 20 summoner, and had access to some NASTY abilities. He could do some incredible shit to you if you charged him head-on, and so he felt secure in his fortified gauntlet of summons that he was constantly renewing.\n\nWhat he did NOT have is good ranks in perception.\n\nOr any sort of aerial defense.\n\nOr a See Invisibility spell.\n\nOr any plan for what would happen if Thoth unleashed the tormented spirits while Barrel shanked his kidneys and shoved him into his own summoning pit.\n\nIt turned out that the incredible soulmass that Sleazeball was using for power was the party's old friend, Vince the battlecorpse (not to be confused with Buster the regular corpse, who was the party's mascot and trap-springer). Vince, once freed, was none too pleased with Sleazeball, and proceeded to beat seven kinds of shit out of him. Sleazeball, master of arcane power, necromancy, and lord of soul-bound summons, was being bitchslapped. All of his defenses relied on having a summoned monster in between him and the threat, or otherwise having Daloris to take hits for him. He had neither. More importantly, what he had was a lot of bleeding holes in him. Sleazeball was dead, and slumped into his own summoning pit.\n\nThat was when the rumbling started. See, Sleazeball wasn't just a powerful summoner... he was also a Lich. And if he was taking damage, he was going to heal it the only way he knew how... by devouring all of those tormented souls for a quick power boost. And, at about this time, he succeded in forcing his eidolon, Daloris, back into this plane of existence and into a fusion with him, resulting in [a horrifying abomination](http://imgur.com/sewG6ak) [perched waist-deep in the summoning pit](https://youtu.be/bfx19Z5pggU?t=4m40s). SMACKDOWN TIME!\n\nWhat followed was an absolute shit show. Sleazeball lost initiative, and his massive 500-ish health started to drop fast, especially after Thoth stabbed him for a critical hit with his maximized shocking shocking grasp stab. Rose screamed incoherently and started spamming Named Bullets, Twiddlest got flanking and introduced Sleazeball to several massive alchemical bombs with sneak attack damage, and Pratena showed off her newfangled Witch powers by staying at a distance and hucking Ki Arrows at things. All of this, of course, while Fishnaut casts incredibly powerful destrucive spells that do damage in the hundreds. Oh, and on Sleazeball's turn, he crit failed on his attack roll. He didn't live long enough to have a second.\n\nWith that, the horrible abomination was plasted apart into its constituent pieces- raw souls. But the party was warier this time, remembering Sleazeball's Lich-y habits, and kept an eye on the maelstrom... And they did indeed find the ghostly form of Sleazeball, cursing them and preparing to do nasty things to-\n\nAt this point, Daloris had had enough. The shimmering outline of her spirit swung back an ethereal foot and caught Sleazeball straight in the groin. The party members thought they had a legitimate beef with Sleazeball, but none of that compared to the hell that had been being his *wife*. Thus, the immortal souls of Sleazeball and his loving wife were trapped in an eternal dick-punting match. The battle was over, the threat was gone, and the day was... well, if not saved, then definitely not getting any worse from here. The party left the hellish plane, had another tearful goodbye with Fishnaut and Vince, and headed home for some much-needed down time.\n\n[NEXT TIME ON \"Relationship counseling for the damned\", THE SINISTER ALPACAS AND WHOSE TURN IS IT TO SHOVEL THE DRIVEWAY?](http://redd.it/3bygoe)",

Lorm started out as a simple grunt, no name, just a uruk with a bow and a dream. Then one fateful day, he happened upon a human, named Talion. Lorm being a simple Uruk, knew that all humans that weren't currently slaves must die, and shot Talion through the chest. Apparently, this Talion was wanted dead by the powers that be, and Lorm the Crippler was made a captain of the Uruk Army. So began a string of 7 consecutive killings. No matter where Talion went, Lorm the Crippler was there with a Bow and his fearsome band of uruks. Talion fell to Lorm more times than was reasonable or fair, and Lorm the Crippler, in a matter of days, became one of the highest ranking members of the Uruk Army. Then one sad day, Lorm was preparing to execute a weaker chief, when out of the blue Talion jumps down from a ledge and slits the Great Lorm's throat. Lorm, the mighty, Lorm the lucky, Lorm the motherfuckin' Crippler, lay dead at Talion's feet. The Uruks that were formally Lorm's band ran off, amazed and terrified that their leader was gone.\n\n\nBut wait! He isn't dead! **LORM SURPRISE!** Talion is on a mission to kill another weak Uruk, when he runs into his old friend. Before Talion can say \"What the actual fuck,\" there is an arrow sprouting from his chest, and Lorm has killed Talion the Ranger 9 times. Lorm retakes his rightful place as one-step-below Warchief, and Talion knows that he isn't the only one who can cheat death.",

        "text": "Sit down around the fire, children, and allow me to tell you all the story about how two level one characters took down three owlbears, otherwise known as “Two guys, one swarm of crabs”.\n\nIt all begins when the duo sit down to rest for their midnoon meal. The day is like any other in a lightly wooded area: sunny, warm in temperature, and generally enjoyable. Unfortunately for our brave band of heroes, they had neither food nor water (though the druid required it not, for his spirit only needed nature itself to be sustained, he enjoyed the feeling of eating and could store the extra energy for later). The two decided to split up in the wood, the druid heading to find food and the the thief searching for water.\n\nThe druid, being a freak hippie of nature, can shape shift, and shape shift he does. Into that of a mountain lion, to be specific. The now mountain lion (I regret that he wasn’t an older woman, because then the word “cougar” could have been used) druid sniffs around, searching for some form or fashion of prey. He finds not the familiar scent of neither dear nor dove. No, instead it is a musk most foul and pungent, which lies just beyond a hedge most close. The druid sticks his head through bushes and, to his surprise. finds not one, not two, but THREE owlbears just chowing down on some low-lying berries, not a care in the world. The druid, however, has many cares about this and scampers on out of their, calling for the thief as he does so.\n\nMeanwhile, on the opposite end of the woods, the thief is snooping about for some water. He finds some animal tracks and, using his thinking cap by figuring that animals go toward water too, follows them out. Blessed by his intelligence, he does find a pond with plenty of water in it. Cursed by his intelligence, there’s a small group of equally small, nipping crabs around him, angry that he dare take their water. They don’t much bother him, so he begins to collect some water. As he stands up, though, over a dozen more of the tiny crustaceans stampeding toward him, fueled by the anger of one thousand roaring suns. Just like the druid, the thief gets the hell outta there and makes his way back to the camp. The crabs, being much, much smaller, cannot keep up and are thus left behind, victorious in pushing off the menace to their pond.\n\nThe thief and druid met back up at camp and began throwing ideas back and forth. Questions like “What if we just use the crabs for meat?” and “Maybe there’s some other food around here somewhere?” floated out. These were quickly followed by the sentiment of “Fuck it, lets lead the crabs to the owlbears”. And lead them they did.\n\nFirstly, they had to gain the crabs’ trust. Thankfully, the hippie freak can talk to nature, and so begins negotiations between an elf and what has now amassed to several dozen crabs (otherwise known as a night in Mexico). At first, the crabs swarmed and clicked forward, but stopped to listen when the druid offered a reward. You see, these crabs loved rewards. They were a war-like species, and trophies of conquest were the seen as the greatest of honors among their tiny minds. The crabs were now intrigued by this offer and begin an uproar of clicking at the prospect. The druid produces a small gold coin.\n\nThe crabs loose their freaking minds.\n\nOne slightly larger crab moves out from the crowd toward the druid and his gold. The crabs fall deathly quiet as that single, brave soul tempts fate. The tension in the air is so thick that it could be, let’s say, crimped with some sort of claw device. The god among crabs holds out a single claw and snips excitedly, ready to receive the offer. And you know what happens.\n\nThat little bastard gets TWO gold coins.\n\nAnd thus, all hell did break loose from the crab kingdom. Crabs erupted from every crack and crevice, flowing out of the pond in such copious amounts that if they were somehow transmuted into cocaine, Charlie Sheen would be humbled. The crabs formed and surged around the druid, creating what was effectively an army of tiny beasts of war born with natural arms and armor. They marched forth, ready to pillage like no crabs had pillaged before.\n\nThe enemy was now in sight. Crab and owlbear stared at one another in ferocity, sizing each other up. The largest owlbear turned its attention toward the druid, who was the leader of this ragtag band of unholy destructors. The owlbear let forth a most mighty screechroad indeed, shaking the forest to its very roots. However, it wasn’t an army of angry crabs, which easily matched the owlbear in decibel level, the cacophony meshing into one beautiful, destructive force of nature. The owlbear charged, taking one step, then another, before the crabs swarmed forth like small children let loose in Toys ‘R Us. The two began a pitched battle, the owlbear knocking off dozens of crabs, only to be replaced by twice as many. Tried as it might, the owlbear could not help but be cocooned in the mass of chitin and muscle.\n\nMeanwhile, the druid and thief decided to strike at a smaller, closer owlbear. The druid moved first, shaping into a lion most easily and pounced upon his prey, rending a small chunk of flesh. Not to be out done, the thief snuck in as fast as lighting and filleted the owlbear right along his shoulder. Before the beast could even strike back, the thief back flipped into the air and landed on a podium of crabs that had risen up to capture him. Now safe upon his stand, the thief waited for his chance to strike.\n\nRemember how there was a third owlbear? Yeah, it booked it out of there with a terrified look in its eyes. I’m fairly certain that it’ll have PTSD and flashbacks from now on. Either way, its two buddies weren’t so lucky.\n\nThe largest one - the once covered in crabs - made a last ditch effort to escape. Pulling some kung-fu shit, it ran toward a tree and rebounded off, throwing its wingarms out into the air and flinging all of the crabs off of it.\n\nExcept for one, that is. Except for that one, beautiful crab.\n\nDavy Crabkett, crab wrangler extraordinaire, gripped onto the now naked (the crabs had cleaned off its fur and feathers) owlbear with all his might, taming the savage beast. Where Davy Crabkett pinched, the owlbear did move. Using skills he knew not that he had, Davy safely glided (It could only glide without the feathers) the owlbear to the earth, riding the naked beast like a cheap hooker, where more crabs swarmed around its paws and ankles, holding it firmly to the earth. The crabs, it seemed, had come to respect the two adventurers and were willing to allow them to have the final kill.\n\nThe other owlbear met a quick death. One one bite, the druid pulled its throat out, betwixt his lion jaws, and severed the owlbear’s connection to this material plane. It was not a painless death, but it was one that befit such a creature. Like the good lord did say, “The dice giveth, the dice taketh away”. And so was one owlbear killed after another had fled. This left just one more.\n\nFrom on high, like a god of death, the thief did descend from his crabby throne upon the final remaining owlbear. The crabs did hold it steady, despite its protests. Saying a short prayer for the fallen, the thief quickly sent the beast onto its next life.\n\nThe bodies were cleansed: fur and feathers plucked, meat stripped, and claws removed. For their valiant service, the crabs did receive two owlbear claws. With their proof of triumph, the crabs did scuttle away most victoriously, proud to have seized the day and become gods among arthropods.\n\nAnd that, my friends, is how two level one characters defeated three owlbears.\n\nCowritten by my dm (gunter) and I. Most of the writing was his, with some editing by me. I was the druid and the thief was a friend.\n",

Cursed by his intelligence, there’s a small group of equally small, nipping crabs around him, angry that he dare take their water. They don’t much bother him, so he begins to collect some water. As he stands up, though, over a dozen more of the tiny crustaceans stampeding toward him, fueled by the anger of one thousand roaring suns. Just like the druid, the thief gets the hell outta there and makes his way back to the camp. The crabs, being much, much smaller, cannot keep up and are thus left behind, victorious in pushing off the menace to their pond.\n\nThe thief and druid met back up at camp and began throwing ideas back and forth. Questions like “What if we just use the crabs for meat?” and “Maybe there’s some other food around here somewhere?” floated out. These were quickly followed by the sentiment of “Fuck it, lets lead the crabs to the owlbears”. And lead them they did.\n\nFirstly, they had to gain the crabs’ trust. Thankfully, the hippie freak can talk to nature, and so begins negotiations between an elf and what has now amassed to several dozen crabs (otherwise known as a night in Mexico). At first, the crabs swarmed and clicked forward, but stopped to listen when the druid offered a reward. You see, these crabs loved rewards. They were a war-like species, and trophies of conquest were the seen as the greatest of honors among their tiny minds. The crabs were now intrigued by this offer and begin an uproar of clicking at the prospect. The druid produces a small gold coin.\n\nThe crabs loose their freaking minds.\n\nOne slightly larger crab moves out from the crowd toward the druid and his gold. The crabs fall deathly quiet as that single, brave soul tempts fate. The tension in the air is so thick that it could be, let’s say, crimped with some sort of claw device. The god among crabs holds out a single claw and snips excitedly, ready to receive the offer. And you know what happens.\n\nThat little bastard gets TWO gold coins.\n\nAnd thus, all hell did break loose from the crab kingdom. Crabs erupted from every crack and crevice, flowing out of the pond in such copious amounts that if they were somehow transmuted into cocaine, Charlie Sheen would be humbled. The crabs formed and surged around the druid, creating what was effectively an army of tiny beasts of war born with natural arms and armor. They marched forth, ready to pillage like no crabs had pillaged before.\n\nThe enemy was now in sight. Crab and owlbear stared at one another in ferocity, sizing each other up. The largest owlbear turned its attention toward the druid, who was the leader of this ragtag band of unholy destructors. The owlbear let forth a most mighty screechroad indeed, shaking the forest to its very roots. However, it wasn’t an army of angry crabs, which easily matched the owlbear in decibel level, the cacophony meshing into one beautiful, destructive force of nature. The owlbear charged, taking one step, then another, before the crabs swarmed forth like small children let loose in Toys ‘R Us. The two began a pitched battle, the owlbear knocking off dozens of crabs, only to be replaced by twice as many. Tried as it might, the owlbear could not help but be cocooned in the mass of chitin and muscle.\n\nMeanwhile, the druid and thief decided to strike at a smaller, closer owlbear. The druid moved first, shaping into a lion most easily and pounced upon his prey, rending a small chunk of flesh. Not to be out done, the thief snuck in as fast as lighting and filleted the owlbear right along his shoulder. Before the beast could even strike back, the thief back flipped into the air and landed on a podium of crabs that had risen up to capture him. Now safe upon his stand, the thief waited for his chance to strike.\n\nRemember how there was a third owlbear? Yeah, it booked it out of there with a terrified look in its eyes. I’m fairly certain that it’ll have PTSD and flashbacks from now on. Either way, its two buddies weren’t so lucky.\n\nThe largest one - the once covered in crabs - made a last ditch effort to escape. Pulling some kung-fu shit, it ran toward a tree and rebounded off, throwing its wingarms out into the air and flinging all of the crabs off of it.\n\nExcept for one, that is. Except for that one, beautiful crab.\n\nDavy Crabkett, crab wrangler extraordinaire, gripped onto the now naked (the crabs had cleaned off its fur and feathers) owlbear with all his might, taming the savage beast. Where Davy Crabkett pinched, the owlbear did move. Using skills he knew not that he had, Davy safely guided the owlbear to the earth, riding the naked beast like a cheap hooker, where more crabs swarmed around its paws and ankles, holding it firmly to the earth. The crabs, it seemed, had come to respect the two adventurers and were willing to allow them to have the final kill.\n\nThe other owlbear met a quick death. One one bite, the druid pulled its throat out, betwixt his lion jaws, and severed the owlbear’s connection to this material plane. It was not a painless death, but it was one that befit such a creature. Like the good lord did say, “The dice giveth, the dice taketh away”. And so was one owlbear killed after another had fled. This left just one more.\n\nFrom on high, like a god of death, the thief did descend from his crabby throne upon the final remaining owlbear. The crabs did hold it steady, despite its protests. Saying a short prayer for the fallen, the thief quickly sent the beast onto its next life.\n\nThe bodies were cleansed: fur and feathers plucked, meat stripped, and claws removed. For their valiant service, the crabs did receive two owlbear claws. With their proof of triumph, the crabs did scuttle away most victoriously, proud to have seized the day and become gods among arthropods.\n\nAnd that, my friends, is how two level one characters defeated three owlbears.\n\nCowritten by my dm (gunter) and I. Most of the writing was his, with some editing by me. I was the druid and the thief was a friend.\n",

        "text": "TL;DR:  Shopkeeper tries to hire us for a job but can't come to terms on a price.  We do the job anyways, I go back to negotiate a price and get shot at, so I leave with more than I came with.  DM pissed because that + the party paladin won't help him punish me.\n---------\nMy party and I had recently arrived at the capital city to stop the marriage of the prince to a vampire.  \n\nWe're about an hour and a half from our normal end of session but the DM doesn't want to continue the story, so I suggest a random encounter.  Because of various drunken celebration shenanigans the night before, I'm not dressed as my normal obvious-wizard-is-obvious self, and am instead dressed as a slightly disheveled, if clean, minor noble.\n\nLo and behold, we stumble upon a ransacked magic item shop.  I didn't recognize it, but the previous session the barbarian and paladin had discovered an uber-item there (that we couldn't afford), and when the ranger and I go inside the shopkeep says the uber-item had gone missing!\n\nNow we're only level 6 and I'm sorely lacking on divination spells to find it, and the shopkeep didn't seem to have any clue who would have taken it or where it would be.  So I ask if he has a crystal ball, and one d100 roll later, there one is - propping up a table that is missing one leg.  Shopkeeper doesn't seem to know that he has it, though.  I use it to scry on the lost item (which is about to be destroyed, so it fails its will save on purpose). \n\nI figure out where it is, we try negotiating a price to rescue it and failing to reach an agreement.  Probably because my starting price was the crystal ball, and he was starting at a 500gp discount on an item.  A large difference, but we're talking about rescuing a sentient morningstar here. I take cash, not credit for that kind of work.\n\nAnyways, no agreement is reached, but I know where the item is, so I lead the party there.  Along the way I stop to commission a glass-blower to make a 6-inch solid spherical piece of glass.  GEE I WONDER WHY :-)\n\nWe get to the foundry where they're attempting to slag the item.  I fly, and search around the foundry till I see the area the morningstar was in when I scryed. It's about to be melted, so I swoop down and *slight* *of* *hand* it off the conveyor, before zooming out the front door that my party members are still hanging around.\n\nA few people try to stop me, but I ignore them and the rest of the party convinces them they really don't want to claim stolen property is theirs in front of a Paladin as I return to Ye Olde Magic Shoppe.  When I get there, I try to come to another agreement with the shopkeeper, who is having none of it.  \n\nEventually he gets frustrated with me and pulls out a crossbow.  I respond by picking up the crystal ball from its spot as a fake table leg, causing things to scatter across the floor.  The shopkeep responds by shooting (and missing) me, and I don't really feel like killing the guy, and am feeling somewhat vindictive at this point, so I cast *displacement* and walk out with both.  The shopkeep closes up his shop once i'm gone, but doesn't follow me so I don't overly care.\n\nWe can all tell the DM is pretty pissed at this point, which is why it's a \"great\" thing our cleric decided to prompt our paladin to go to the magic shop next.  He gets there only to have the shop be open again with a fuming shopkeep inside.  He yells obscenities at the Paladin about his choice of friends, etc. OoC our paladin asks the DM to stop trying to get the paladin to be the party police (the paladin hadn't initially joined us on our random encounter search until put there by the DM, and this isn't the first time the DM has turned to the paladin as a magic 'make us play a LG party' button), and in-character he says that he doesn't know where I am, but allows the shopkeeper to follow him around (and then proceeds to watch the cleric proselytize all day).  DM is pissed off, ponders making the Paladin lose his powers, also mentions not being sure if he even wants to run the campaign any more.",

        "text": "So I've been sitting here and doing a lot of thinking. I've thought about school and my job. I've thought about strategies for my pathfinder group so we suck less. I've thought about the efficiency of putting a nuclear power plant in low earth orbit and how to get the energy produced back down to earth (I'm thinking lasers but they would constantly need to be re-positioned due to orbit and the rotation of the planet). And I've also thought about which story I would post here next.\n\n I have two stories in my memory banks that I'm considering. The first is a tale of how we got into a situation where we pulled a Dukes of Hazard on a Nordic demon. The other one is a recollection of an act of treachery most heinous committed by one that I believed to be my friend in which he I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU DID THIS TO US YOU FUCKER I THOUGHT WE WERE YOUR FRIENDSIMGONNAGOTOYOURHOUSEKICKDOWNTHEDOORANDFKNKLLUWTADFUVDDVJWWEKNERNKVO;JA232MDSVMQ\n\nOkay I'm back now. I was out for around a half hour just there. What I think happened was the unyielding fury that I have for that moment boiled up to the surface and sent me into a furious blood rage until a blood vessel burst and I redded out for a bit there. I'm better now.\n\nWe're doing the other story. For my sake.\n\nAs per usual with my group, this was a homebrew session where every now and again, fun and enjoyment took over as tribe elder and we impaled the rules with a pike like in Cannibal Holocaust. ~~I'm getting way too creative with these~~ Also, names were changed to protect the innocent and even the not-so-innocent.\n\nSo continuing on in the same world as and some time after the [surprise nighttime 3000m bear dash](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/39r39z/i_dont_need_to_outrun_the_dire_bear/), Jack the sniper, Cody the berserker, and myself as Big Boss: Master of High Sorcery, decided to walk all the way from Greece to Germany because Germany seemed like a cool place for one reason or another and cars, trains, and planes didn't run anymore. We get a couple days out, killing the occasional mythical creature for food, when we get ambushed by a Mad Max movie. No seriously, Master Blaster and a bunch of freaks on motorcycles ride up out of nowhere and start attacking. Fortunately, they were no match for the pro strategy of turning invisible and popping everyone with a silenced .45 pistol and advanced CQC. As we send them beyond Thunder-dome, we collect our prize. We didn't care about money, weapons, or copious amounts of leather, what we took was those sweet, sexy Harleys. We all get on a bike and ride out towards Germany.\n\nSide note: You ever seen a man kill a giant scorpion by driving past it at 70mph and cut it in half with a one handed greatsword swing? It's pretty awesome.\n\nSo we're still riding down the proverbial highway to hell when we spot an old house in the middle of nowhere surrounded by zombies and the sound of gunfire. Always on the careful side, we park our bikes far away from the house and sneak up close. We see that it's a woman holding up in there against the undead. So we decided to white knight a bit and flank the attacking zombies, making quick work of them. The lady let us come inside the house once the area was clear. She wouldn't tell us who she was or why she was there. All she told us was that there were a shitload more on their way and she had plenty of ammo to share. And so began Horde Mode...\n\nNight falls and we are set upon by a plethora of zombies. Cody runs right into the middle of them and starts wildly spinning, cutting them apart with his greatsword with one hand and spraying a light machine gun with the other. Being a berserker allowed you to do some pretty freaking metal things when the opportunity arose. Jack and the lady were sniping from the rooftop and I had forgone subtlety and started unloading with a LMG from inside our fortifications. Hey, Snake uses a rocket launcher in every single game so it's alright for the sneaky guy to use a very loud, very powerful weapon every now and again. We're mowing through them when we spot something in the sky, Jack marks it as a manticore.\n\n Now here's the thing, in ancient mythology, manticores breathed paralytic poison. The thing basically dropped mustard gas on us and we were lacking in gas masks. We all scramble into the basement and start blocking up the cracks with wet rags as we scramble for anything to breathe safely as we hear the poison roll in. We wait a few minutes for the poison to settle to the floor before coming out, makeshift breathing masks over our faces. Everything was much too quiet now, until we noticed the glow outside. We run out the door and find, in the distance, Fenrir approaching our location.\n\nFor those of you whose only knowledge of Norse mythology is The Avengers, Fenrir is a massive wolf demon born from Loki (yeah, Loki birthed a wolf demon, a snake too) and is going to one day break free from his bindings, eat the sun, and kill Odin the all-father. He was also on fire for some reason, kinda explained why the area was a barren wasteland now. We take one look at this thing and realize that we need to GTFO ASAP KTHNXBAI. Me and Cody run to get the motorcycles while Jack and the lady shoot at the wolf with every last enchanted bullet they had. Lightning, ice, explosive, all the rounds do a whopping total of FUCK ALL to Fenrir as it keeps coming at them. Finally, the lady pulls out her last trick, a black hole bullet. Jack sends the shot down range and the area explodes in the energy. The force of the miniature black hole is so strong that me and Cody narrowly avoid getting sucked in by the gravitational pull. Do you want to know what the total effect of that tremendous power was? It slowed Fenrir down a little bit. Oh joy.\n\nFenrir starts picking his speed back up just as me and Cody arrive with two of the bikes. We split into two on each bike, me and Cody on the backs, toting our LMGs, and start our daring escape. I want you to picture something for me. Try to imagine **two motorcycles riding through a desert wasteland while spraying light machine guns back at a flaming wolf demon the size of a city that's trying to eat them!** You don't get much more metal than this right here. Sure, it was terrifying, but it was also face-meltingly awesome as well. We're going as fast as we can on those Harleys, but they're weighed down by all the people and equipment. When we ran out of bullets for our big guns, we tossed them aside and used our little guns. Anything to speed us up and slow that monster down.\n\nFinally, Jack and the lady spot something ahead. It was a canyon with quite a large drop. If we could make it across, we might escape Fenrir. Problem was, we weren't going to make that jump with our speed. So the lady decides enough is enough and smashes the onyx ring she had on her finger. Suddenly, the ground starts moving with us. Our speed is tripled and a land bridge sprouts across the canyon as we approach and erodes away once we crossed. We all let out a victory cheer, we escaped a harbinger of the apocalypse on motorcycles. We were all really fucking pumped as we rode all the way to the heart of post-fantasy mutation Germany.\n\nLater on, we found out the lady was the half-daughter of Pluto, or Hades for the mytholigicaly challenged. She joined us on our quest to have a good time inside the blast-zone and was our main crafter and supplier of enchanted bullets and weaponry. All in all, 10/10. Would flee screaming from a Norse demon on a motorcycle while spraying bullets from a machine gun again.",

        "text": "Get ready, cause this one is a long one.\n\nLast we left our heroes, two main members of the party had their memories erased, one of the affected had killed a mushishi and set fire to her house, and the party is now en route to Kyoto.\n\nAfter exiting the forest, the group decides to stop for the night. Oddly enough, they find a supernatural sakura tree (i.e. cherry blossom tree), with pink petals and *golden cherries* that just so happen to have the same effect as the golden sake. \n\nEach member of the group harvests some cherries, save for Lee who wants nothing to do with those unnatural cherries. Rayet, a little frustrated that Lee won’t accept mushi, decides to try and pour some of the juice from these cherries down Lee’s throat while Lee sleeps. This fails, and Lee becomes angry at Rayet. Lee, understandably, threatens to leave the party. We won’t have that, however, so Yamaha duels Lee, with the winner deciding what happens. Yamaha wins, and Lee stays. This is the first in a long line of duels for determining outcomes of dispute, and it’s also the beginning point of a trend among the party.\n\nHaving settled up any disputes for the night, the party retires to their slumber. They did not, however, remember to set up a watch. This becomes a problem come morning, when Lee and Yamaha discover that Rayet is nowhere to be found, yet her mount is still there. Rayet realizes there’s a problem too, once she wakes up hogtied in a cart with about 20 other women. She had been kidnapped for sale as a slave.\n\nWhile the kidnappers, who were Ronin by the way, took Rayet without notice, they did leave a note essentially saying, “Nananana boo boo, we have your friend and are going to sell her as a slave. Ha-ha.” What the slave traders didn’t realize, or perhaps counted on, was that Rayet’s party didn’t particularly care that their companion had been kidnapped. So they continued along the path, half-heartedly looking for their companion as they went along.\n\nThe kidnappers also go along their way, stopping in a monastery to rest up. They hide their \"merchandise\" and rest up for the night. Little do they know, the party stops at the same monastery.  Figuring that these are probably the same slave traders that kidnapped their companion, the party decides to try and find her. \n\nIn their efforts to find Rayet, Yamaha begins mingling with the Ronin slave traders (read: getting them drunk), while Lee searches for Rayet. There were two areas of interest, a storeroom, and a nearby shed. Lee goes for the storeroom, encountering resistance in a few monk guards. Naturally, he dispatches the monks by throwing them off a nearby cliff. He then enters the storeroom and finds… sake. That's it.\n\nFrustrated, Lee then goes and gets Yamaha, who had by this point gotten the Ronin pretty drunk, and they continue to search. Soon, they find another secret room *beyond* the sake room. Feeling that this is the right one, they enter the room. Once again, they find the room empty. All is not fruitless, however, because they do find signs that people were there. A little distraught, they exit the room and end up coming out of the shed. Once out, they discover that the Ronin have already packed up and left. They follow suit, trying to catch up.\n\nFast forward a little, and now the group is together again. Somewhat. Lee and Yamaha meet up with the Ronin and start traveling with them, all the while hatching various plans to get their friend away from the Ronin. I would just glaze over the various plans, but that wouldn’t do them any justice. So, I’ll just throw them in a new paragraph.\n\nFirst, they try a tried and true method; sneak a knife to the person they’re trying to aid in escape. So Lee tries to sneak Rayet a knife under the pretense of seppuku for dishonor. Lee gets Rayet the knife no problem, but she doesn’t get a chance to use it before the head Ronin’s wife notices and takes the knife away. She then makes the suggestion of silencing Rayet by shoving a hot knife down her throat (shoutout to Analogue: A Hate Story!). Luckily, the group dissuades her.\n\nThe next attempt involved trying to break her out through a bathroom break. Thing was, they didn’t actually manage to get to Rayet during the break. Her Dire Fox, Kashikoi, did, yet she still was unable to break free of her restraints. (Forgive me if this sounds a little off, I’m having trouble remembering the events correctly)\n\nThe final attempt occurred at night. This time, instead of trying to be discreet about it, they just go full on murder hobo. While the Ronin were sleeping, Lee and Yamaha start rampaging through the camp while on their mounts, trampling around half of the slavers before they even woke up. Even upon waking up, though, they were still no match for the two samurai. At the end of it all, the Ronin lay dead, and Yamaha laid claim to the slaves.\n\nEnd of story, right? Not really. Here we begin to see the cracks form in a characters psyche. None of us know how exactly he came to this conclusion, but Yamaha somehow decided he needed to have the most wives in the land. So, he took 9 slaves, Rayet included, and the former wife of the head trader, the wife’s name being Ling Ling. And with that, our “heroes” set their minds back on Kyoto, and continue towards their goal!",

        "text": "Our party was just finishing our quest to perform selective immolation of bridges along the border provinces (it’s a long story), when we were attacked by a trio of huge orc warriors wielding odd bows. They managed to shoot two of our three horses out from under us in a single round (we ate well that night), so the Ranger and the Wizard chose to take up defensive positions behind their equestrian corpses. Meanwhile, the Paladin decided it would be a great idea to charge all three gigantic orcs on the last surviving horse. Needless to say, he ended up pinned in the dirt. \n\nThankfully, the Ranger and Wizard managed to provide some decent covering fire (literally, in the latter’s case), and the Paladin avoided being skewered. This was also the first session our wizard got to try out his new Flaming Sphere spell, and he took great pleasure in sending it careening into the orcs over and over again.\nThings were still touch and go when the Ranger rolled a critical failure with his longbow. We wish it had ended there, but unfortunately, our group has a homebrew confirmation mechanic. And he rolled another one. The DM ruled that his longbow had cleanly snapped in two.\nThere was a general sense of terror in the group at losing a third of our damage output, especially since one of the orcs had managed to disengage from the Paladin and was now looking at the squishy ranged fighters with an air of considerable malice. But then the wizard, without missing a beat, said “ugh. Here, borrow mine.”\n\nThe wizard had been holding onto a crossbow since level one (old habits die hard). In retrospect, that was probably the only reason we all got out alive. With the Ranger properly chastened on the merits of forward thinking, the party went on to do what parties do: loot. It was at this point that things really started to go downhill.\n\nWe found two things on the orcs: a journal and several gold medallions. A good knowledge check and a lucky language proficiency later, we discovered that these wayward bandits were actually the personal escort of the heir to the closest thing the orc tribes had to a king, off doing the orc equivalent of adventuring (read: pillaging). The heir whom we had just brutally murdered. To put it into perspective, this was rather like discovering that one has just killed Genghis the Impaling Hun’s favorite uncle. So naturally, the wizard decided to do the sensible thing, and burn everything.\n\nTheir bodies were incinerated, their journal destroyed, their bones buried, their horses stolen, and their medallions hammered into unrecognizability and sold to a certain C.M.O.T. Dibbler, a trader who understands such… sensitive matters. We ran like the cowards we were, back to the king who had originally requested the aforementioned bout of bridge destruction, and swore never to speak of what transpired that day. We pray that nobody else does, either.   \t  \n",

The party arrived at a warehouse, asked some questions to an unfriendly gang, and upon failing a bluff check, one of the gang members pulled a lever and the warehouse gate came crashing down with a slam and with that, initiative began.\n\nThe party was split up, and the members outside had to find another way in or somehow lift the heavy gate door (they were unable).\n\nOn the ground floor of the warehouse, they fought 4 rogues.  \nOn the catwalks above, were 4 alchemists with different types of bombs.  \nAnd finally there was a boss, who was actually same level as his minions. Loose Eyes Billy, a guy who knew only one spell and one spell only ... magic missile. Only he knew Toppling Spell, Dazing Spell, Empowered Spell and Persistent Spell.  \n\nIn the first round, the alchemists drank their mutagens, and the rogues snorted a powder the PCs did not identify until later as the drug \"Scour\". \nThe Alchemists were in perfect range for dispelling bombs, exploding bombs, smoke bombs, if a PC came near, they would drink a bomb and breath it out a-la Breath Weapon (Breath Weapon Bomb).\n\nThe rogues on the ground were there to do sneak attack damage but actually never managed a single flank and the group had communal stone skin which would have helped against Sneak Attacks as well. This saved them alot.\n\nThe Wizard stood back on the catwalks and once a round would fire 5 magic missiles which would daze or topple up to 5 PCs. The Persistent Metamagic is brutal! Especially if you target someone with multiple missiles, then they have to save so many times or be dazed or fall prone.\n\nAs the fight went on, the group had a lot of difficulty getting any significant action economy. They often found themselves prone or dazed, and on fire from Alchemist bombs ... The rogues wree pretty useless without sneak attacks.\n\nWhat really did them in was the ranged touch attack bombs and the persistent daze magic missiles. \n\nThings were looking mighty grim until the Bard and the axe throwing halfling found a way through a back door and viciously murdered the Crowd Controlling Magic Missile Wizard. When the party was no longer dazed or prone, the Alchemist soon fell as well.\n\nI'm not typically a fan of one trick ponies, but I'm finding that as a player I like when encounters have a \"gimmick\", almost like a puzzle, and I also feel that creating a one trick pony enemy creates a unique opportunity for an enemy backstory. \n\nAt times I felt like it was very close to a TPK, with many party members around 10 hp or less, the Cleric would Channel, heal some enemies at the same time and another bomb would go off. I didn't hold back in the fight and I think the players appreciated it. It was a challenging fight that legitimately made the PCs mad at each of those enemies and so glad when they got their sweet revenge once the wizard died and the tide of the battle turned, they just absolutely murdered everyone.\n\nI just wanted to share because I thoroughly enjoyed running the encounter and it seems the group thoroughly enjoyed it as well. I know there is no punchline to my story or funny anecdote, but I thought maybe some of you might enjoy reading it too.",

        "text": "*This is a story derived a session from the campaign I’m currently in. As I was one of the players, I will tell you the tales from “my perspective” in character as I experienced them. Everything has been rp'ed already and if you need clarifications on what was rolled/what actually mechanically went down, Let me know. I have changed the wording of the use of tech for the flow of the story.\n\nLong Story Ahead*\n\nMy name is Despair and this is the Tale of Me and the Monk. \n\nI came Red Larch in an effort to find out more about these rampaging monks that are kicking around the townsfolk for sport and domination. Not necessarily to stop them, but more so to observe their tactics and steal anything in fighting strategy for myself. I personally don’t believe in oppression and outward violence, so if there’s a fight, I won’t get involved unless I feel as though there is an absolute requirement for me to, but I am well capable of holding my ground. \n\nWhen I entered the town for the first time, apparently this town had a well-established group of adventurers that defended the town, but under some circumstance they were wiped out by these monks that continued to plague the town with their antics. \n\nI was asking around the town if anyone was fighting the monks advances, and with most of the townsfolk telling me no, I decided to head to the bar to see if I could catch wind or sight of anyone rising to the challenge to deal with these monks. \n\nI enter the bar and order some food to feed to myself and my pet mouse, scourge, who hides under my cloak after swiftly grabbing a piece of my steak from my fingers. \n\n(As a Tiefling with long red hair I wear a cloak and an actor’s mask that makes my horns appear to be decorations to help conceal my heritage, as most people see tieflings as a threat to the good.)\n\nI look around as the bard plays, nothing that there doesn’t seem to be many people here that have seen combat first hand, a couple of villagers and a couple of caped figures I cant readily identify. I keep to my comer of the end, watching keenly for prospective entering adventurers to get to fight these monks while I assess the situation. \n\nAnd lord behold incomes a aarakocra in full birdlike glory. I chuckle as I see the reactions from the commoners in the place. They aren’t used to exotic species as humans and locals of towns usually are not. I shrug it off and wait to see if anymore will enter behind. \n\nNone do. I go back to eating my food in quiet watch. \n\nThe bird sits and begins to order food, and after it is apparent that he is speaking a language one of the commoners approaches him sort of boldly and states “are you a beast? Can you speak a common language?”\n\nAlmost without thinking I step in between the bird and the man, glaring at the man from behind my expressionless mask.\n\n“That was rude of you to start a conversation that way”\n\nHe looked like he didn’t get what he had done wrong.\n\n“How was I rude!? I was asking if he was a common beast or a beast that could speak common? And for that matter it’s rude to hide your face in public!”\n\nI glare at him from behind the mask, knowing that he can’t see my changing expression of disgust.\n\n“Only the uncultured would not understand that there are more on the earth than what you’re used to. I’m almost sorry for you.”\n\nThe man becomes a little Irate at my response but quickly chirps back with a “Well this isn’t a freakshow and I’m wondering why there’s a pool of freaks here! I don’t know-“\n\nIt’s obvious that the bird is trying to diffuse the situation, but I’m about to enter a rage. Before I go completely hostile, A familiar face of mine enteres and pushes me back so that he can block my view of the man. It’s a Warlock I’ve encountered throught the years in different places, sometimes working a parallel job, and sometimes alongside me. He does know my full name but has taken a liking to calling me the Big D for whatever reason. I calm my emotions upon seeing his half-elf intervention. \n\n“woah woah woah my brothers! What is the cause of this fighting! I’m sure you, a man of great adventure can understand what diverse people can come into these parts!”\n\n“i just work for the town, I’m no adventurer, I’m just a worker for red larch”\n\n“so you’re just a commoner?”\n\nI can tell that my friend is about to lose his patience as well, and I let out an aggravated sigh that comes from dealing with guys like this one. I look back to the bird noting that he’s trying to be a pacifist still. As I look him up and down up close, I hear the calls of anguish and fear, a sound I know too well from my Urchin days.  We hear shouts from outside the bar that the monks are attacking again, and they are terrorizing villagers. \n\nThis is my chance to see what they are capable of. \n\nThe Bard, Bird, Warlock, and I run out to the scene with introductions done along the way. Apparently the Bard is \"mine-something\" (a dwarven name i didn't catch), the aarakocra’s name is Gale, and My Half-Elf Acquaintance Maglor Faelivrin reveled in hearing me tell the others that they could call me D for now. \n\nThere’s no need to share names if I’m not sure I’m going to see you past the nightfall. The world is a grim place for adventurers after all.\n\nWe get to the sight of all the commotion, and I immediately begin to stealth and get cover behind a house. The others in the group approach the monk’s group openly alongside guards from the town that are prepared to fight the monks on their land. I watch and try to see what the strengths are the enemy are from the shadows, picking out a spell caster,  some Dagur (dugar?), and a couple of other monks. I noticed that the monks and caster had on eloquent masks, much more of a delicate and elegant nature than my own solid emotionless mask possessed over my face. \n\nI had a bad feeling about this fight. With me in the fight it would be 10 v their 11, and I was not aware of the combat abilities of my side of the group being composed of a dwarven bard, a constable, a bird, and a bunch of city guards that might not account for much. I kept my cover as I watched the caster speak in his boisterous banter to our group commanding us to give up our possessions and whatever as if he owned our bodies and souls already. I mentally chuckled because usually these people are the sneakiest bastards and use underhanded methods to win where they can not otherwise. It’s sort of an odd stand off, since neither side has really attacked the other, and I’m wondering how I can get a ranged hit in since I didn’t bring anything to red larch but my armor, gold and my two short swords I have come to love.\n\nAnd then Maglor begins to walk forward, asking for a parlay between himself and the commander of this monk force claiming that it would be a dishonor on his monastery If he refused this right to challenge. To my surprise the man motions for him to come over and they speak too far for me to hear, and I realize that they may have some sort of honor to the way that they move about.\n\nOdd. My initial thought was that these were completely blood thirsty criminals that would backstab Maglor the instant he walked away from stabbing range. \n\nHe comes back to the group and tells them of the conditions. I overhear from the shadows.\n\nA duel with each side’s best “champion”. \n\nI mentally curse at the Warlock in abyssal. If only he could hear me speak I swear he would think I was about to challenge HIM to a duel. I didn’t see any tactical advantage in showing my position OR fighting the best of this monk group with no idea if it was going to be a spell caster, so I did not speak up. \n\nI have an innate fear of magic users and the tricks that they can implement.\n\nThe bird speaks up and squawks that he will accept the duel and decides to make it into a duel to the DEATH. \n\nI softly place one of my palms to the mask I am currently wearing, saying that if he dies in this fight, there is no way for him to plead fool at the end of the day when he is dead. That being said, if he is able to take out the guy I personally will go after that spell caster since that would have been their “best man”.\n\nAfter the bird shouts his acceptance, I see the spell caster make a nod, and from behind the monk’s ranks comes a man with a highly ornate mask with no eye holes for vision that is quite ornate and beautiful. I decide right here and there I want his mask. I don’t know how I am going to take it, but I will find a way someday to get it off of his body and into my possession.\n\nI find out that his name is Leesin, and the duel between the two commences. I see from the start that the man is so quick he starts the battle with a firm advantage effectively stunning the bird to his knees and raining monk blows to him left and right. I note immediately his stunning technique and fear its effects, as my bird friend is effectively being put out of commission in a matter of seconds. I see the bird take flight and I immediately know that that’s not a good sign as he’s chugging a potion of healing from the sky. \n\nSeeing Leesin look up, I already can see that he’s waiting for the bird to come back down to knock him to the ground, and I can’t yell his tactic because then I would give away my position. I Bite my tongue as the bird as the bird swoops in for another attack, ready to swipe, but is quickly met with a fierce readied attack by the monk. Taking enough blows to the face to even make me shudder, I see the bird attempt to grapple the man and bring him into the sky, making me believe that he is going to attempt to fatally drop him. The way that he’s acting, it’s making me believe that this bird was a monk and just was given the short end of the monk training, wherever he is from. \n\nI see Leesin continually try to rain blows on the bird as they go up, and it’s obvious that the bird doesn’t have much to hang on to when he takes a good strike in the sky. I see the fall and immediately, I get the hell out, heading back to the center of town, maybe even the bar. If the bird went down that quickly and it was agreed that this was a duel to determine everyone’s fate, I refuse to be a part of that transaction. \n\nThat’s the god damned problem with Warlocks and making deals. They often write checks with their mouths that their souls can’t cash. I hear yelling and strife as i run, but I don’t care. I’m not going to be a slave for monks. I’m not even into religion like that anyway. The Warlock has dug his own outhouse and now he has to answer for the shit he’s gotten himself and his “friends” into. Right before I get to the areas i'm familiar with for quick travel, I hear signs of the guards engaging. I believe that this means that we might be overtaking their team, and so I run back to assess the situation further. Somehow the Warlock looks like he was nearly stripped of his clothes and is running what i assume to be heading back closer to the town. I see the body of the bird being kicked to death by the monk Leesin, and although I find it disgusting, the bird did loose a duel to the death. But then I saw the dwarf’s body and realize that he was killed too, probably by the monk. I look over to the remaining guard, constable, and my slightly undressed Warlock acquaintance and I ask him should we be fighting or running, and they tell me to run, and so I begin to step away.\n\nAs soon as I begin to step away from the three comrades I see a spell cast in their area just outside of where I was moments before. A shatter spell reigns free, knocking my Maglor down to low health while the constable and the Guard runs away. \n\nIt’s at that moment I see that the spell caster has sent the Monk  Leesin to kill my nearing unconscious acquaintance, which I will not allow. \n\nI step in between him and Maglor both swords drawn saying to him \n\n“Walk away from this body. He is mine.”\n\n“I’m going to kill him for my master.”\n\n“Try it. I will show you the true meaning of Despair.”\n\nHe cockily walks around me and punches at Maglor, and with a swift blow to his face, puts him down right in front of my face while I was shocked he had the balls to ignore me. \n\nIt’s my turn move now, and I viciously I take my attack and with inspiration to kill attack with a godly advantage. \n\nI hit. \n\nI then spend a quick moment after the blow hits to trip him, sending him hard to the ground before I hover above him looking mercilessly at his prone body. I stab him as he’s down not doing much, but letting him know how it feels to attack those that are prone. But then It becomes obvious to all those that are watching that he is about to die by my hands for being so foolish as to get me pissed off as I go beyond my limits and strike him twice again as he is on the ground. \n\n(The DM says … how much damage did you really just do?\n\n33.)\n\nI say to the Monk “you shall die tonight.”\n\nI hear the Spellcaster’s frantic screams of negotiation from his cozy positioning about 40 feet away from me. He sees the situation and realizes that if I strike again like I just did, his knight in shining mask will be slain, and so he tries to bargain with me. \n\n“SPARE HIM and I will SPARE YOUR FRIEND! THAT’s WHAT YOU WANT RIGHT?”\nAs he says it, I say nothing but look in his direction with my mask on. I turn back to the Monk and whisper as I’m still above him, “you shall die tonight.”\n\nThe spell caster takes an action to just hit my unconscious friend with a shatter. He takes another death save but I looking over at him I get the sense that he stabilized on his own. Just as I see that he has stabilized, a strike to him by the monk who has risen while I was turned, once again takes him back to teetering with death. I Take an infuriated swing at the monk and hit, and it becomes obvious that he’s at death door as my second swing barely misses.\n\n“I am going to kill both you and your master. Prepare your funerals.”\n\nThe spell caster thinks that it’s funny that I make such a threat with no visible way to attack him from that distance, and as a result decides to shatter me and my friend, putting him that much closer to death. I get hit by a shatter, but I stand my ground as it does weak damage to my grounded stance, and I point directly to the spell caster and hellishly rebuke him with a solemn and loud “die”. He takes a whopping fire blow from my finger and it’s obvious to the monk I’m fighting if that fire had hit a little harder, his master would be dead. He begins to punch at me, landing a blow to me and trying to stun me in the same way he did the bird, but seeing the move in action has made me aware that he has the capacity and I stomp away my notion to be put to the floor and I say to his face once again as I stand tall.\n\n“I told you, today you shall know the true meaning of despair.”\n\nThe spell caster sees that I’m about to do something reckless and orders the monk to retreat right in front of my face, while sending in another monk and a damaged dagur to attack me in his prized fighter’s stead. He sends them to their death, ordering them to distract me by attempting to attack my fallen comrade while they make their escape. \n\nI furiously attack the monk who I can just *tell* is gleaming from behind his mask.\n\n“YOU BITCH! Get back here and FIGHT!”\n\n“My master wishes me to fight another day, and so I shall.”\n\n“Sounds like a thing a bitch would say. I will take care of you personally if you dare to show yourself here again.”\n\nI face the incoming threat of the now Enlarged Dagur and the pathetic monk that plans to take out my friend while I still exist nearby. I don't know how i'm going to do it, but I will save his ass.\n\n\"You really *really* going to do this Dagur? Monk?\"\n\n\"I shall fight to the death for my master and ascend to the holy ground of those fallen in combat\"\n\n\"Allow me to make that trip to the holy grounds a short one.\"\n\nAnd that’s when A Half-Elf Paladin shows up behind me, ready to assist me in combat and help fight whatever is causing the the town to be put in a state of panic. \n",

        "text": "A tale from sundays gaming session:\n\nThe party had been hired by a noble to infiltrate a group of pirates before a planned attack on a ship carrying magic items, and make sure that a certain item would find its way into the nobles possesion instead of the pirates.\n\nSo we go to work on investigating the pirates and find out who they are. The plan is to make sure a number of pirates are indisposed before departure and then offer ourselves as replacement to their captain. The GM had really done his homework and all of the pirates had names and distinct traits, so we could figure out, who were easy targets.\n\nOne of the pirates was a female dwarf notorius for fighting in bareknuckle street boxing. Our half orc barbarian Greg figures if she gets hurt during a match, then nobody would raise any questions about why she can't sail, and he would take her place on the roster.\n\nSo our tall level 6 half orc barbarian with 19 in strength shows up at a fight and challenges the dwarf. She is half his height with scorn in her eyes. They size each other up and the fight commences.\n\nThe fight becomes very graphic as GM and the player describes every move. The dwarf wins iniative, and the DM describes how she charges in and start pummeling him in the stomach. He elbows her in the back to get her away, and they start really going at it. It turns out, that she is also a barbarian, so they both throw rage and reckless and whatnot in to the fight.\n\nAt one point she throws a brick at his head, which he in turns picks up and uses to bash her in the head. As said, its very graphic, and the rest of the groups sits mesmerized.\n\nLater the orc drops down on one knee and uppercuts her. He crits, and the GM describes how she is thrown several feet back. She stands up, spits blood and a half tooth, and smiles. Aaaand charges again.\n\nAs they're both barbarians and no one is dealing any real damage unarmed, it turns into a slugfest from here on out. At the end they're half wrestling, half supporting each other and panting. The dwarf holds him tight and leans in an kisses him through the sweat and the blood. The rest of the group is roaring with laughter, and player decides that the orc kisses back. Our party cleric yells \"It's a draw\" and calm down the audience.\n\nSo the dwarf and the orc is now an item, and she is a member of a pirate crew, we're planning to betray and rob in the next session",

        "text": "Every two years, my high school had a two day \"Alternative Learning\" period. Classes were cancelled and students could sign up for lectures and activities on anything from French cooking to the Grateful Dead to birdwatching. Naturally, everyone loved and looked forward to these sessions, especially since some of the less stringently administered and/or student-run programs were thinly-veiled excuses to just not show up to school for the day.\n\nAround my sophomore or junior year, one of the events offered was called the \"World Game.\" Students were split into teams, and each team represented a country. The goal of the game was to advance your country as much as possible on a number of categories including human rights, economy, technology, and the like. There were set levels to advance for each of the categories, but, as was frequently mentioned to us by the game's administrators, there were \"no rules.\" \n\nA few students had been chosen to act as a U.N. surrogate called the World Association. They were in charge of awarding the levels, distributing aid, and managing the world's money supply, which sat in a large shoebox on the World Association table. How the levels were earned was more or less entirely at their discretion. Prices were set by negotiation and cooperation, either between countries, or with the World Association. \n\nI was assigned to play China. We started out with an excellent economy and decent tech scores, but dreadful human rights. While the rest of my teammates set about figuring out which nations they could cooperate with and what the best ways to improve our human rights score were, I sat silently. *There were no rules.* Everyone else I could see was playing the game in good faith. I, on the other hand, was the kind of asshole who wanted to find an exploit.\n\nAbout an hour in, we were doing okay. We had improved our human rights a bit at minimal cost to our economy. My teammates were starting to get slightly angry with me, as I had been sitting there doing absolutely nothing since the game began. Around this time, I found my exploit.\n\nI grabbed one of my teammates, who happened to be a very attractive girl. Whispering, I let her in on the plan, and sent her over to talk to the guys manning the World Association table. She pulled off the distraction perfectly. There were only two people at the table, and they were both freshman boys. Awestruck by the attention they were receiving from this older, beautiful girl, they completely failed to notice as I casually walked up to the world money supply. \n\nI stole it. I stole all the money in the world. Every last dollar. I walked back to my team with the biggest shit-eating grin in recorded history on my face and dropped the shoebox in front of them. \n\nWhen the World Association noticed a few minutes later, we ransomed it back bit by bit in exchange for maxing out every single one of our national objectives. China was so far ahead of the rest of the world it was as if we'd entered the year 3,000. The administrators had to stop the game, and the entire class got a lecture on how we were the most dishonest group of students they'd ever had participate in the program. It was worth it.",

        "text": "In my gaming group, I recently had to create a new character so that I had a character who was interested in traveling with the other characters (party dynamics were getting messed up, and the Paladin and Cleric couldn't travel with the morally ambiguous characters). So I created a Warforged. We homebrewed him to large size, and gave him Adamantine Body, and 5 levels of barbarian.\n\nWe also made him naive and slightly dumb. He was named Doorjam, because his previous owner said that he was as useful as a doorjam in a heist. Then brought him to a wizard's tower. \n\nWe cleared out the ground floor, and decided that we didn't want to squeeze up the staircase, so we climbed the outside of the tower to the 4th floor, and cleared the Chimera out of that floor. That's when things got weird.\n\nMy companion (Ally Leandra as Doorjam called her) went up the stairs, and called to Doorjam from the floor below.... So Doorjam went down the stairs, and wound up on a higher level, then went up the stairs and wound up on the first floor. The stairs randomly spit us out on a different floor every time you went up or down. Not a problem, except we clear a floor of all the treasure and desecrated bodies, and the stairs start acting normally again.\n\nWe make it up to the 4th floor and can't get any higher, even though we know there's at least 2 more floors to go. Ally Leandra couldn't figure out a way to make the stairs work again, and Doorjam certainly wasn't going to figure it out. So Doorjam does the only logical thing for him to do. He slam attacks the ceiling and breaks a hole into the next level. After a minute or two of work (and a ruling that since Adamantine weapons bypass hardness, and he has adamantine body, his slam attacks bypass hardness too), he has a hole in the ceiling to the next level.\n\nTHEN Leandra remembers she has stone shape and could have made the hole herself. SMH\n\nThe last 3 levels of the tower we get to by Doorjam smashing his way up the staircase and facing whatever devils appear on the other side.\n\nI'm still waiting to hear back from my DM on how we were *supposed* to reactivate or control the stairwell.",

        "text": "I just got home from my bi monthly Pathfinder group and I wanted to share while the facts were still fresh. I have NEVER laughed so hard during a game or had a DM actually vomit from laughing so hard.\n\nSo we're playing a canned adventure, Legacy of Fire, and our group is pretty standard; Fighter, Druid healer, Monk, and a gunslinger. Tank, heals and off tank, and some dps.\n\nSo the group is securing an old monastery so the caravan we're traveling with can use it as a staging area before we proceed to our main objective. My fighter is out front, preparing to tank, with Druid and bear pet beside him and dps guarding rear. We get into the cathedral area and discover a nest and ambush of Pugwampies.\n\nNow if you've faced this menace they are basically Hitler. Quick, hard to hit, and they have an aura that fucks you up.\n\nThe Druid and Monk decide to go up on the scaffolding to attack these Pugwompies who are in the rafters of the ceiling. Me...I've been a DM and anytime I set up a ceiling battle people die so I was not going up there. The gunslinger and I decide to provide support from the ground and begin to do so...badly. \n\nNow the other thing we didn't know about these assholes is they can cast shatter once per day. So the Druid gets almost close enough to attack and his intended target shatters his axe :(. He then tried to hit him with the handle and he and his bear break the eaves their standing on and fall to the floor. The monk punches, misses, tries to jump the gap left by the Druid, passes one check, fails the second, and joins the Druid on the floor. Both are critically injured, both are probably not getting out, we're all quickly getting fucked proper.\n\nSo I decided to burn down the monastery. I go to throw a large canister of oil and instead douse myself in the oil. \n\nTurned to DM and deadpan stare, \"I wanna set myself on fire.\"\n\nSilence\n\nDM: What? Why?\n\nMe: because that's the only way they can't get me!\n\nGroup loses it\n\nThe gunslinger finally managed to kill them after I helped the monk and Druid stabilize and retreat but as a vet of tabletops this game was by far one of the most ridiculous and fun ever ",

        "text": "The Drunken Huntsman was unusually busy today. As soon as he opened the door, the bosmer’s voice called out to him.\n\n“Amren! Hello, my Redguard friend, in the market for some hunting supplies?”\n\n“No, only mead and mead today, I’m afraid. Preferably more of the latter.”\n\n“Your wife again?” Elrindir asked with half a smile.\n\n“How’d you-” Amren began. “Gah. Whiterun is too small and your ears are too big.” He sulked as the elf slid him his ale, still smirking. After a few sips, he spoke up again. “Who’s the stranger?”\n\nElrindir looked over to the table in the corner. “Him? Some Vigilant, I suppose.”\n\n“I can tell,” Amren replied dryly. The man wore the green-grey robes of the Vigilants of Stendarr. Four or five mercenaries, guards, and other patrons surrounded him, laughing. “He’s causing quite the stir.”\n\n“One that doesn’t involve ‘Stendarr’s mercy,’ I hope. At least not in the Huntsman.”\n\nIgnoring him, Amren grabbed his mug and walked over to the crowded table. Noticing him, the Vigilant smiled. “Sit down friend. We’re just getting to the story of my drunken trek across the mountains!”\n\n“Drunken? You partake, Vigilant?”\n\n“Of course.” He gestured to his mug. “Do you think the Vigil was founded by a sober man? Declaring eternal war on man’s greatest enemy is a fool thing to do.” The stranger was a tall man, with dark brown hair and slightly sad eyes. His beard was covered in froth from his ale, and his leg was bandaged and resting on the table. “Ah. You see the leg. I’ll get to that.” Amren had no doubt that he would; the stranger had been babbling continuously since he’d entered.\n\n“So, as I was saying, the Vigil was sending me to Helgen to investigate its destruction at the hands of the daedra…”\n\n“It was dragons,” a guard butted in. “My cousin saw it with his own eyes. Eyes the size of wagon wheels. Breath like all the fires of hell.”\n\nA chuckle went around. “Dragons are children’s stories. Tell your cousin Ulfric Stormcloak doesn’t have any scales.”\n\n“Peace, peace,” the stranger said. “There are a thousand rumors, and few truths. I plan to visit its ashes myself. Regardless, I had stopped in Morthal to spend the night. I woke up and broke my fast on stew and Alto wine. You’ll notice my decision-making skills are lacking. A bit dizzy, I decided to take the shorter mountain pass rather than walk around to Falkreath.”\n\n“As any sane man would do,” Amren laughed.\n\n“Exactly, my friend. I had decided not to go through Cold Rock, as a frost troll makes its home there now. But to my surprise, I met with his brother on the road. He was brutish, smelly, and angry, as all trolls are. I survived, but not without a scratch.” He pointed to a gash on his shoulder, wide but not terribly deep. \n\n“Exhausted, I made my way further up the road. But to my surprise, I didn’t find the Labyrinthian unfold before me. You see, my friends, in my drunken stupor, *I had taken the wrong path.*” The mercenaries howled with laughter as the stranger chuckled into his cup.\n\n“So there I was, at the top of a mountain, puzzled as a skeever’s arse as to why I was looking upon a word wall and not some ancient ruins.”\n\n“Eldersblood Peak,” a guard chimed in. “I know the place.”\n\n“And in front of the shrine, I was met with another surprise. Three more trolls.”\n\n“They’re attracted to you,” said the guard. “Must be the smell.”\n\n“Doubtless,” the man said, grinning. “Is that how your father wooed your mother?” Even the guard laughed then.\n\n“That wasn’t all, though. Quickly, I realized that if I retreated to the mountain path, the trolls would follow. So -- and this made perfect sense at the time – *I stumbled off the side of the mountain*.” The Huntsman exploded into laughter for a full minute.\n\n“Some time later, maybe an hour or so, I woke up. I don’t know how I survived, but this leg was my worst wound. Thankfully, the Vigil teaches all their students to heal broken bones,” --the man’s voice dropped to a mutter-- “even those without the gift of magic.”\n\n“When I was confident I could go on, I made my way to the Labyrinthian. Sober this time, I found it easily. The place was littered with bones and scraps of wood. I was about halfway through, at the entrance to that old dome, when I heard the first roar. Do you know what it was? Another frost troll,” he spat. “I had had quite enough of them by then, so I ran for it, ignoring the pains in my leg. I had almost escaped, and the archway that leads to Whiterun Hold was in sight. But from that very archway, a howl rose up, and down dropped another frost troll!”\n\n“You should’ve just taken the one in Cold Rock,” laughed a sellsword. “Gritted your teeth and been done with it. Better one than – what, five?”\n\n“You’re cursed,” claimed a guard, taking off his pointed helm. “Pray they didn’t follow you into Whiterun. Though one of their skulls on my mantle would be nice.”\n\n“Rest easy. The one following me lost interest soon after this” – he picked up a rippled blade, with a hilt in the shape of a beautiful woman – “came out of his friend’s stomach.”\n\n“A fancy sword,” Amren remarked. “Where did you get it?”\n\n“You would not believe the cost,” the stranger said with a sad smile. “Not worth half the trouble.”\n\nHe sighed. “Limping and bleeding, I climbed down the mountain. Whiterun Hold never looked so beautiful. Wild mammoths roamed in the crisp autumn air, and hawks flew overhead. But I had not walked five minutes until I was ambushed. A bandit jumped out from behind a tree, warhammer raised high. I barely raised my shield in time, and a horrifying jolt went down my arm. She came at me with another swing, and I thought it was over. And then, from out of nowhere, a mammoth tusk swung at her with such force to cave her chest in. The two beasts I had seen peacefully roaming about were now attacking bandits left and right. I don’t know what angered them so, but I was glad of it. I picked myself up and began my trek to the city. The trumpeting of mammoths and the screams of flying bandits filled the air behind me.”\n\n“The rest of the story isn’t as interesting. A quick word to the guards outside the town and the gates were opening. I stumbled to the nearest alehouse to rest and recuperate. And here we are.”\n\n“What?” Amren asked, astonished. “This all happened this morning?”\n\n“Aye,” the stranger grinned.\n\nAmren shook his head and made his way back to the bar. Elrindir put his stew down just as he arrived. “Eight septims.”\n\nHe counted out the coins. “You hear all that?”\n\n“Mmh,” the bosmer mumbled in affirmation. “But I doubt more than half is true. Either way, that man seems the dangerous type.” Amren nodded.\n\n“Elrindir.”\n\n“Yes?”\n\n“I have an idea. Get me two more mugs.”\n\n“Of course. What do you propose?”\n\n“To claim my sword *and* keep my wife.”\n\n“A risky idea, it seems.” The elf handed him ale with a smile. “Pray you don’t lose both.”\n\nAmren walked back to the stranger’s table. “Here, friend, for you.” The mug landed on the table with a thunk.\n\n“Oh? My thanks.” They drank in silence for a while.\n\n“I’m afraid I still don’t know your name, Vigilant.”\n\nThe man put his mug down and wiped his beard. “Godric, if it please you. Godric Marshwarden, named so by the Jarl Igrod Ravencrone herself.”\n\n“Doubtless an exciting story.”\n\nGodric shrugged. “If you like vampires.”\n\n“I’m Amren. Nice to meet you.” He offered the man a hand.\n\n“And you.” Godric shook it firmly.\n\nAmren put a hand on his shoulder. “Have you tried mercenary work?” he asked. “It might suit you.”\n\t\n",
