I am considering majoring in Computer Information Systems, but am unsure.\n\nI am from a low income family. Neither of my parents ever actually completed college, and my older brother is in rehab (he never did either, I would argue that my parents were negligent toward him and it could be suggested that they have been toward me in recent years, my therapist did suggest this and called CPS over a specific incident.) \n\nMy father is an unintelligent alcoholic who actually seems sort of off. \n\nI have been raised in a predominantly white and Asian environment. My city has a low percentage of black people.z I am least naturally attracted to Asian men, and most naturally attracted to black and white men (I was re watching Star Wars recently and thinking about how cute Luke Skywalker and Lando were to me.) \n\nI admittedly deal with internalized racism, and am perhaps also a colorist. I am introverted and tend to look quite tired if you meet me in person. I have been told that I have a big butt.\n\nI actually do kind of want to have a child, but will admit that I am afraid to give birth and am afraid of what I may look like after giving birth, especially since I have grown up not feeling good about my appearance. I remember feeling properly happy and healthy when I was taking care of black kids this summer at my internship\n\nMy longest crush was on a mixed (half black half white boy) who was slightly above average but is average now (in 9th grade.) He looked mixed, sounded like eazy w\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/zyye31)",

No fever/cough or anything. Just struggled to walk and couldn’t lift things well ect. My parents didn’t believe me.\n\nA few days later both my parents get the same symptoms. They struggle to do up buttons, or change my baby sisters nappy. Extreme weakness with no other symptoms. Tho my dad took ibuprofen and developed a fever. My sister never gets symptoms.\n\nAfter a couple of days symptoms pass and it never returns. During Christmas we talked about it, what we called “peg leg” because my very first symptom was walking with a limp as one of my legs went weak. My mother is an Osteopath and I am doing biology at university but we cannot find anything realistic that matches these symptoms.\n\nThe only thing is polio, however muscle weakness from polio is rare, so all 3 of us getting it doesn’t make sense. Also all of us had polio vaccines and there hadn’t been a case of polio in UK Since 1984.\n\nIf anyone has any suggestions as to what it could have been please discuss.",

Through this first semester I've come to the realisation that I don't enjoy the research side of biology nor do I really like doing lab which is a large part of biology combined it seems. My passion and the reason I chose this subject is because I love nature and wildlife, and I originally envisioned myself being in nature, working with animals or just observing and collecting data. I'm not interested with reading and writing scientific papers or making lab reports or any of this more academic side. \n\nReading about wildlife biologists and other related work I see that a lot of that work is seasonal and also incredibly difficult to find in the first place with permanent positions even rarer. I really don't want such a lack of job security in the future. Any advice would be greatly appreciated",

Besides what is the chance that humans are the only creatures on earth that have a conscience? Slim to none. I think it’s just that we have no idea what an animal’s conscience would would look like considering majority of animals aren’t capable of speaking a human language. It’s a funny and strange thought. But somehow it just pisses me off so much to hear people say things like animals lacking conscience or other bs because of religious or one sided beliefs. I understand that’s the way they were raised but even just going to the park do they seriously just view the birds or squirrels as mere objects? So strange to me I guess",

Have we been lied to all this time? 😭",

I've always wanted to study biology, but life unfortunately made me drift somewhere else in my studies, and due to my current personal situation I doubt that I'll have the time nor the money to invest into a biology University course, so I'm resigning to just studying it as a hobby for the time beign, but I want to do it as good as I can. \n\nAnything is good for me, any topic really, I have a very broad iterest when it comes to biology, book recs, websites, those pages with downloadable pdfs, maybe recordings of classes or seminars, stuff that maybe some of you used when studying yourselves?\n\nThank you for taking your time reading this.",
