        "text": "I'm struggling with this one. I've been friends with this woman, let's call her Ashley, for about 4 years. She moved to my city about 4 years ago and is a friend of a friend, so she quickly integrated into our friend group. Her and I immediately hit it off - two single ladies who loved to adventure outdoors and party! We took an epic road trip together that sealed in our friendship and were basically besties for about 2 years. \n\nBut over the years, we've both changed in ways that makes us have a lot less in common. I slowly became less interested in the party scene and eventually stopped drinking altogether a year ago. She's always been a huge drinker in a way that's sometimes problematic (think embarrassing stunts/falls at parties, crying or ranting and not remembering anything later, blacking out often, etc). I had many heart-to-hearts with her about this but she seemed overall disinterested in making real change. She thinks therapy is unnecessary and stupid. I also have a partner now and she's still single and bitter about it - hates and distrusts men, etc. She's been rude to my (very kind) boyfriend a couple times. So yeah, we've grown apart and I've naturally distanced myself from her. \n\nBut the problem is, she still wants to maintain our friendship and hang out 1-1 and I've recently realized, after she asked me to get dinner, I just have no interest. I don't enjoy my time around her at all anymore, and in fact being around her is actively draining. So I'd like to just be casual friends, meaning we see each other at friend events but that's it. But I don't know how to say that to her without causing a Big Drama. We have this big, tight-knit friend group in common and if it gets out that I \"ended the friendship with Ashley\", it would just be chaos. Most other friends feel the way I do about her, but she has a few close friends in the group who I'm also close to, and I worry about the impact.\n\nSo ladies, what would you do? Just keep rebuffing her requests to hang out 1-1 until she (hopefully) gets the message? Be (even more) blunt? Something else? Thanks in advance!\n\ntl;dr: I don't enjoy spending time with a former close friend, how to remove myself from the friendship without starting issues in the friend group?",

Unwanted sexual attention doesn’t make me feel good about myself. It makes me hate you more. Apparently I’m one of the few women in the world who feels this way because I’ve been told by men and women both, that getting attention should make one feel special. \n\nNow, I’m so turned off by guys.

        "text": "Hello all! Long time reader, first time poster. As performance reviews are coming around at work I am starting to think about the year to come and how I am not motivated. I work in talent acquisition and my company is promoting me into a manager (Yay!). I love my company. They are flexible, have a great mission, CEO is a fantastic human, co-workers are super supportive, and we are a small company. I feel like I hit the jackpot with the company. However, I am so over this job itself. \nRecruiting fell into my lap 8 years ago when I graduated college and a family friend referred me to a contingency company. I have good people skills and generally organized, so it quickly became a fit for me - but contingency was really tough on me and I found this company! I’m coming up on year 5 here and feel like I never even wanted to be a recruiter, yet I have no other skills or interests. \n\n\nI just got married and we are looking for a house, but we are ready for kids once we get settled. This feels like the right time to think about something new before kids. I just have no idea what would be next. \n\n\nWhat do you think? Stay with current job because the company is so great or start thinking about something completely new? I don’t want to wake up in 10 years and really feel like I can’t get out of this industry because it’s the only thing I’ve done. Have you ever changed careers? How’d it go?",

        "text": "Hey all! Having looked through most of the posts in the sub, I couldn't find a similar enough situation to mine, so here we go.\n\nTL;DR (32M) newly EX BF is still living in my (33F) house rent free in his last semester of school, he just lost someone dear, has no place to go. I love him and want to be there for him, but I want to be able to use my space as I like. WAT DO??? \n\nTHE DEETS:\n\nI (33F) broke up with my bf (32M) of 5 years.  \n\nThe long and short of it, is that it's an amicable break with the potential for a rekindling if he does the work on himself he needs to.\n\nFor some background, we feel like we're each other's family, because I'm NC with my dad after he tried to manipulate me to live my life his way, and my (ex)bf is NC with his mom, who abused him growing up, and has her own set of manipulate tendencies. \n\nGiven our families with shitty behavior, we've each gone through some pretty tough times, and really been there for each other.\n\n\nBecause I never know what info Reddit may find important or not, I'll include the fact that I'm an only child, and he is the oldest of 4, and has thankfully been reconnecting with his younger sisters (in their 20s) in Cali.\n\n\nOur situation right now:\n\n- I bought this house in 2018 on my own.\n- I work as a Process Engineer in semi.\n- I've been supporting us and the 2 dogs the last 3 years since he quit his job in order to go back to school. \n- He suffers from ADD and depression, and hasn't been able to find a consistent solution, which means he struggles to study among other things.\n- It's his last semester of a second degree in Philosophy. First was in Finance, but when he finished that degree he couldn't live with the idea of doing any jobs in that field. \n\n- I broke up with him at the beginning of December 2022 (it's been a LONG time coming, and there was never a good time...for months).\n\n- Part of our discussion included that he would try to get a part time job, as he has quite a bit of free time during the week, but struggles with Depression and finds it difficult to do anything but the minimum.  Not judging, as I have Depression and ADHD as well and we both can go through cycles over time, and understand each other.\n\n- A week after we talked, HIS BEST FRIEND/FATHER FIGURE PASSED AWAY AT 42 unexpectedly. \n\n- He was taking care of his state, and we went through it together.  It was and still is so fresh and painful for us both, and it feels like we're really the only ones that've \"got\" each other, if that makes sense. \n\n\n- The ISSUE: We are clearly both still grieving, and I can't begin to imagine the depth of the loss on his end.  \n\nFor me the relationship has been over for months due to big decisions he made independently and without talking to me, that directly affected the future of our relationship and future plans we had made.  \n\nWe've done individual and couples therapy for years, but here we are. \n\nI KNOW how callous this may sound, but it's been over sexually between us for a WHILE. We're still affectionate and I'm very supportive and comforting of him, since he's going through a major life crisis right now.  At the same time...he's still continuing to live rent free in my house, and I don't feel that I'm able to have the space I've wanted for so long to focus on my individual goals (including exploring my sexuality... I'm a VERY late bloomer, but that's another story). \n\n\nHe doesn't have anywhere else to go, it's his last semester, he just lost the most important person in his life....how do I navigate being able to use my space how I like while being compassionate? Is it naive to think that's possible, and I should just wait till May, after he graduates?  I believe in living on my own timeline, not someone else's because life is short, but I care about him and want him to feel like he's still got someone who loves him, who will always be there for him.",

I’m a mom with a demanding job so just being able to sleep for 10 hours and having some alone time is amazing.\n\nI feel like “bath stuff” is obvious but I’m open to recommendations of particularly amazing products that I could order and would come in time or are at a chain like a Sephora or Lush.\n\nI’m also planning to bring a VR headset to do some meditation apps and play games, my comfiest pajamas, fuzzy socks, and cozy clothes, a few weed gummies, some mini bottles of champagne, and my favorite snacks and maybe a book to read and a journal. I’ve asked for a late check-out so if all goes well, I’ll have the room for about 20 hours, meaning I’ve got about 10 waking hours to fill with calm activities. If it fits in my suitcase, I might bring my back massager…and my vibrator, of course.\n\nIt’s in the center of a busy downtown, so there are probably other “amenities” I could schedule - it’s walking distance from a decent massage parlor, a spa that does facials, a few yoga studios.\n\nVery interested in what you would do or bring!",

I originally blocked her account (as well as several of her friends and family members) because I thought it was weird as hell, but she ended up making a fake account after that (a tech savvy friend showed me how to confirm this by using the 'lost password' feature).\n\nI went private for a while, but as soon as I was public again, she was back. Though I did harbor some negative feelings for her in the beginning, it doesn't bother me anymore. However, I find myself really curious about this behavior. I have never in my life been this obsessed with anyone, not even the men I have dated (lolol).\n\nI guess I'm just wondering if anyone has experienced anything similar?

It’s happened to me before for specific reasons and now, I just don’t speak with them besides hi and bye when necessary. That’s fine and it’s pretty easily manageable because they don’t like me either or have serious mental health issues, so I either don’t talk with them or just don’t take it personally. \n\nBut my own brother? It’s strange. I guess the first thought in my mind is “What the hell are we going to do when our parents die?”\n\nWe both don’t have partners or children. We are 15 years apart (he’s older). We are so god damn different. He’s never been into school and I always have. Politically we don’t align. That’s fine because I don’t align with my entire family, but at least I can talk with them.\n\nWith him it feels like he always trying to tell me what to do, how to do something, or giving an opinion that I don’t agree with. It’s absolutely infuriating. My mother told me one time that she believes he may be developmentally delayed (or at least always thought he was, had suspicions, but never confirmed). He does not know this and I try my very best to be “nicer, softer, kinder, and more open” with him. \n\nBut I just can’t and don’t. I will just respond to whatever I’m being asked and that’s it. I don’t like sharing my life with him. If he’s in the room, I get quiet.\n\nI just don’t know what the fuck to do. Anyone else had similar experiences?",

He said yes, we openly talked about what he was viewing and agreed for a healthy relationship to keep it out. He came to me and openly admitted to having viewed pornography with no sexual gratification to see about something he wanted to do with me. He later, after proposing, told me he had done this to clear the air and enter a marriage with a good, clean heart.\nSo this is 2 times we have agreed it is not a good thing. We have been together 5 years now, I don't know if that matters, but for context I will add it.\nRecently, I got the notion, just in his behavior of being on electronics a lot it could be a possibility. I asked him and he said yes. I feel so betrayed. He stays up one night a week to play fortnite with his best friend who lives across the country. I am supportive and don't mind. Then after fortnite he has viewed pornography and masterbates before coming to bed. I am devastated for so many reasons. Obviously, I feel unattractive. He has pictures and videos on his phone of me so he can use them of he ever needed to as we lived 45 minutes apart until recently. \nI feel lied to, betrayed. So many things. I told him to go away and meditate this week and pray and come back to me and we will have a sit down, so he could reflect. We have done this many times. Last night it came to light he was not doing that and assumed things were OK. Meanwhile, I am unraveling inside. I am so triggered because I dealt with this for 7 years in my marriage last marriage. He referenced it as a tiny slip like I was making a big deal of it. We have always honored and validated each others feelings. This is not the person I know. Now I am scared to marry him and told him last night we may not. I do believe he is scared now, worried, and going to do the work reflecting, praying, etc. To have that healthy conversation. My trust is absolutely gone, I question everything he says and wonder what else is a lie. I am scared to enter into a marriage with him and don't know how to move forward because how can I trust him, this is the 3rd time. I am looking for similar experiences, advice, and support.",

        "text": "Me: 39f. Oldest of 2, brother lives out of state with SIL and baby nephew \n\n\n\nBackground: About 2 years ago I moved back home with my parents to help my dad renovate their house. (He’s a staunch do it yourself-er, but needed the help). This was supposed to be more or less a temporary situation until the bulk was done then I’d move out.\n\n\n\nAbout 4 months into it my mom had a mental breakdown. She was admitted to in patient care for depression and anxiety for 2 weeks. She was declared unable to work and is currently seeking disability benefits. \n\n\n\nThis put me in a position of also propping up the household finances together with my dad working full time. \n\n\n\nIssue: my mom has struggled with depression and anxiety her whole life. So much so that I don’t even feel like I’ve ever experienced a “typical” mother-daughter relationship with her. \n\nShe has been in therapy on and off her whole life, but never seems to make any progress because she lacks any and all ability for introspection. She has a constant victim mentality (why is this happening to me?! Why is life so hard?!) and has no clear understanding of the ability of ownership over one’s life and circumstances.  \n\nLet me be clear: she has a loving husband, 2 successful, loving kids, a beautiful home, a nice car, she wants for nothing. \nEXCEPT, her behavior (and the constant drain on peoples energy) has caused her to push away my Brothers wife. SIL can’t handle it; and nor should she have to. Brother and SIL had a baby a year ago. My moms depression and anxiety and constant need of happiness and fulfillment OUTSIDE of herself has driven away SIL and in effect made it to where she doesn’t get to see her grandson as often as she likes. \n\nThis distance causes her to spiral. Putting my dad and I constantly in a position of coddling her breakdowns, and generally affecting our mental health as well. \n\n\n\nWe both feel lost. My parents lost their health insurance when she lost her job, so therapy isn’t an option anymore. She’s still on her meds. I constantly try and coach her through her breakdowns, but IM at my breaking point. I can’t even tend to my own mental issues that this is all causing me because I’m afraid she’ll do something drastic if I’m not there constantly.\n\n\n\nI feel trapped, guilty and responsible. I’m afraid for my dads health, as it weighs on his just as heavily, if not more.\n\n\n\nShe has no hobbies. She doesn’t want a part time job (even though we could use the money). She’s pushed a majority of her friends away because, honestly, who would want to hang out with someone who is constantly in woe-is-me mode? She watches game shows all day, and sulks. \n\n\nThank you if you made it this far.\nI don’t know what to do. Help?",

We talked about a lot of personal things. She told me her ex used her and put a lot of things on her name causing her to be in debt. She said she almost finished paying everything off and then another thing popped up that she had to pay a couple thousand euros for. After that she stayed for a whole weekend at my place. We just couldn't have sex when we tried on Friday because I was very sick and I just couldn't perform. I couldn't stay hard, I was feeling so bad because of a flu. She left on Sunday then she was texting me the rest of the day calling me baby and sending hearts. The next morning she texted me good morning with a regular smiley emoji instead of her usual heart or kiss. I felt like the energy was off but didn't really say anything about it. The rest off the day she didn't call me baby or send any hearts of anything. Then the next day the similar energy continued and I asked her if anything is wrong. She said because of her financial situation she won't have money for Christmas which was later that week. She said she needs to focus on her work and household until all the stuff with her ex is over and feeling like she has to text back all the time just doesn't fit in her situation right now. I feel like I just messed up with the love of my life because honestly I've never met a more perfect woman in my life",

        "text": "I consider myself to be a fairly assertive person. I have never entertained abusive dynamics, and have gradually built the habit of never entering into even subtly imbalanced friendships with people my age.\n\nHowever, I have noticed that I become uncharacteristically \"meek\" in certain unique social situations. Upon some reflection, I have noticed that this is prompted by an \"escalation\" of domineering behavior, and involves someone more than fifteen years older than me who I meet and am getting to know as a friend. \n\nOur dynamic starts out normal, then they say something slightly inflammatory. I let it slide easily because of the different expectations I have of middle-aged people. Time passes, and they say something else inflammatory, and by this time a rapport has been built and I am unsure of how to exit, despite the discomfort I feel at their remarks. I also sense a deliberate malice on their part. This continues until I finally get fed up and exit the situation.\n\nHowever, even this exit is in a \"meek\" way (I don't explicitly call them out on their behavior because of an instinctive feeling that they cannot be reasoned with and only ugliness can come of it). I metaphorically back slowly away from them until I am out of sight. \n\nTo add some context, I am a twenty-something African immigrant woman and the real-life examples are two different white people in their late thirties/early forties escalating racist and controversial comments. One dynamic lasted for months, and the second and latest one lasted only one evening at a bar.\n\nFor those of you who have trouble promptly exiting increasingly imbalanced dynamics, how have you guys learn to deal with an \"escalation\" of bad behavior (whether in friendship, work, or romantic context)? For black women especially, how do I avoid this or deal with it?",

        "text": "I am really struggling with what to do here. I've always dreamed of a wedding weekend at a resort on the ocean. My fiancé hasn't really cared about the venue as long as I'm happy. We talked and he wants to pay for most of the venue himself because he makes more than me. Our parents will cover outside vendors. Most ocean front resorts/hotels cost about $40k for our numbers. He cannot fathom spending that on a wedding. He would ideally spend $20-$25k on a wedding which he quickly realized isn't possible in our area after some research.\n\nThis venue is about $34k with open bar which isn't bad considering every other venue I looked at was $40k+. He asked me to schedule a tour and we go on Saturday. On the way there, he tells me that he wants this date in June. At the end of the tour the coordinator asked if she could check any dates and my fiancé said June. She previously said she had 3 dates in June, the only one left was the date my fiancé wanted. We put a hold on it which gives us until this Saturday to sign the contract.\n\nOn Sunday my fiancé decides he's going to look at negative wedding wire reviews. There's not many, because I'm told vendors can remove reviews that are negative. Basically the reviews talk about turnover for the day of coordinators(one girl went through 3 in 2 months and none of them knew anything about her wedding) and how brides didn't find out about the 2nd or 3rd wedding until a month before. They stagger it so the 1st wedding ceremony is 5--5:30 then cocktail hour 5:30-6:30 and second ceremony is 6:30-7 and cocktail 7-8. He then notices in couple submitted photos, that there's people in swim suits and blue, white and bright orange umbrellas in the photos. He immediately starts freaking out and tells me if we don't want this venue that we need to start looking at others ASAP. We don't want to wait more than 2 years for the wedding and venues are already booking up for 2024.\n\nWe talked to his sister who calmed him down and suggested if the umbrellas cannot be moved maybe we can ask them to move the orange one's out of the frame so the blue and white blend it a little more. Also said if they do 2-3 weddings a day then most guests will be attending those and off the beach for out ceremony. After that he came to me and said the wedding would be beautiful.\n\nI also asked in a local wedding group and had a mix of people who got married and had great experience and others who already got married saying to stay far away(only two said to stay far away, some just regaled their negative experience).\n\nWe got the contract and he's figuring out how to send the money for the deposit, but I'm feeling extremely guilty over spending this much on a wedding. I feel like it's sort of too late to ask him if he's still ok spending this much. If he wasn't he defintely would speak up. We also have 2 years to put money away for this. Any advice?",

Scary things, like breaking into the guy she was obsessed with emails and reading all of them. Breaking into his bank account and monitoring what he was doing EVERYDAY. She would drive to his house and contemplate knocking to talk to him since he had already told her to stop. She called him over 100 times in one night! What?  She also contemplated slashing his tires and lighting his car on fire just so she could offer him a ride to wherever he needed to go… \n\nThen, all the comments on that post were just as bad and just as terrifying as OPs. These people stalk and are obsessed. The worst part of it all was that some even mentioned that they’d never suspect them of doing that. \n\nStay safe out there.",

I usually give them a few chances to stop (maybe they are having a bad day?) but if someone is carrying on treating me like shit I don’t respond well. (Or maybe I do? What do you think?)\n\nRecently, the shopkeeper of a store made fun of me in front of other customers for wearing a mask. Like, “Why do people even DO this anymore?” type comments. And she kept going, like I triggered her just by walking into the store. I turned back and looked her in the face and told her she “really shouldn’t insult customers when they walk into your store” and I walked out. She seemed surprised that I said something but didn’t respond. As if I would continue shopping?\n\nThe other day, I went to a warehouse to buy supplies for a renovation. The woman helping me was so snarky to me because I was asking her “basic question.” I have never done a project like this before and I had trouble explaining things. She was like, “I can’t help you if you don’t even KNOW ANYTHING”  which rubbed me the wrong way because I did have the information but she kept getting more and more snarky the more I was struggling to communicate. I guess this place is used to dealing with actual designers and contractors. “There’s no reason to be so rude and aggressive to me” and I left.\n\nDays before that, a woman who worked at the post office literally berated me insisting that I did not have a prepaid label but I totally did. I was like, “I’m sorry you’re having a bad day but you are wrong.” Lots of shouting (from her) until another worker told her she was wrong.\n\nIn all of these situations I never yell back or act aggressive but I do “gently clap back” and then worry I’ll look like the asshole. I have a feeling it happens because I look super young and people think I’m stupid or annoying? It feels like they have a sort of “predatory rudeness” to them it seems. I just can’t deal with people like this, it’s very triggering. UGH!",

And I was so annoyed with the whole situation I redownloaded dating apps simply to distract myself from reaching out to casual guy. Well I actually matched with a guy. Obviously it’s still very early on but I’ve never been treated this well or communicated to so clearly. Genuinely didn’t think there were guys out here like this still. And yes I’m still getting to know him and being careful but it’s so refreshing to have this interaction. Anyways, I guess I’m writing to say thank you for your support and that there are still good guys out there for you who are looking, even on dating apps!",

Two years ago I lost 20kg, downloaded tinder and one of the first guys I’ve met was my current boyfriend (28M) I’ve been with my boyfriend for almost 1,5y. I’m turning 33 in a couple of months. Its my first relationship and honestly there hasn’t been that many dates and sex partners (mostly ONS). I feel pain and have very low self esteem because of it. For the life I missed, missed being hit on, having regular sex, finding out what I want and like and enjoy, having more partners and experience. I cannot get over the fact that I missed my life and now it’s too late to get it back. My bf has way more experience but he was stupid enough to brag about it to me (not the actual numbers, but that he slept with sb older, took sb virginity, was hooking up with sb that whatever etc.) and tell me way more that I needed to know about his ex gf. I don’t blame him for having a past or wish he hasn’t had those experiences, I’m just stuck on missing mine. There are stuff I’ve always wanted to try, but now that I know he tried them, I don’t want to do it with him and be compared to sb else. Is there anyone that got over it? Or will I forever feel pain over it?\n\nAnother issue is, he was following half naked women on IG and sending those photos to each other with his friends. I asked him to stop it, he said he would. He lied. I cought him still doing it. His explanation was that he thought I would get over it and it won’t be an issue in the future. Now he tells me he understands and he is doing exactly what I asked. I checked his profile on another portal (a while back he told me his @ and said he didn’t do anything bad on it) and what do I find? Him liking and commenting on naked and topless photos of young girls. Of course he’s not doing anything I specifically asked him not to do, right? I just mentioned almost naked women on IG. Yes, he’s a lawyer.\n\nI’ve read a lot of his comments and they were awfully derogatory to women, calling them sluts and other derogatory words in my native language, a lot of them said that they are to be used and banged and put in their place. He knows I’m not as experienced as him, so it plays into this narrative, but makes me be the naive inexperienced girl that is easy to manipulate and use.\n\nAs lame as it sounds, when he’s with me he’s sweet and caring, but now I Wonder, am I getting played? We were talking about moving in together but now I’m having doubts.",

His traumas regarding sex and intimacy came up again and we rarely have sex anymore. We argue about me not being on time or sticking to plans. Some arguments about planning home improvements. But this is all on the surface of something I notice happening on a deeper level.\n\nWhat I notice is how grumpy/angry/sad/resentful I feel most of the time. I feel like I want to leave (and have spent some days in another place), but then I miss him and tell him I’m coming home again, and then when I’m there I feel all these stifling emotions coming up again and I want to leave once more. It drives both of us crazy.\nWhen everything’s fine, I feel my mind looking for ways to start arguments, or looking for things he did “wrong” so I can pout about it. And then when it happens, I feel so guilty and sad and afraid he will leave me because I am not the happy, relaxed person I was before. \nI’ve heard this from previous boyfriends as well and when I’m single, I never feel this way. I am afraid that I’ll never be able to have a happy relationship and that I’m sabotaging my happiness myself.\n\nIm starting therapy again next week to work on this. I guess I’m just wondering if any other woman can relate and give some insight on why I am like this and what I can do to not be like this. I feel like a crazy person.",

Gave me a bloody nose as a child and didn't apologize. He then choked me and beat me up when I was a teenager. \n\nAnd I could never meet the expectations of my fucking parents, either. Never! No matter what I did, it was always, \"Oh, Mary from the next door aggregates all the A's\", or \"Little Susie next door is going to law school\". Ffs, they always told me since I was a toddler to become a fucking lawyer. Nothing wrong with becoming a lawyer except that it's not my thing. \n\nI attempted to kill myself and I didn't fall through with it because I didn't want the family to live with that trauma, but also to do better for myself and at least have some sort of hope. The hope was that I will be able to do better for myself and get myself out of this shithole. \n\nAnyway, I found a high-paying job and the job itself was good but I had the worst of luck with people who harassed me. I didn't want to go back home but I did because I caved into my mom's stupid \"come-back-home\" line. \n\nWell, it's shittier now that I'm back home. I'm in a job that I like but I'm getting paid way less than before. Because of this, I have to live at this fucking house that I hate so much.

It's always, \"You remember my friend's daughter? She's banking mid-six figures now\" or \"You remember Janet, right? Janet's a doctor now.\" Then he tells me that I don't contribute anything to the family, that I should be just married off, that basically he owns everything in the house.... \n\nWhy did these people, who never wanted me in the first place, make me come back to this shithole just to make me even more miserable? \n\nWhen I was a teenager, if I did something that he didn't like or talked back, he told me to strip naked and get out of the house because he paid and owns everything.\n\n\nI was going to move out but due to health issues and financial reasons, I ended up staying far too long for my liking at this fucked-up place called home.

        "text": "I'm almost 32, and I'm gaining a level of acceptance around a lot of things. One of those things is that my parents will always just be who they are, and there's no point in making a fuss about it.\n\nOn Saturday, I had ended up in A&amp;E. I had been stacking a load of firewood, lost my balance, and landed badly on the unsorted pile, with wood cutting into my pelvic area. (Like, one side of my vulva.) I was bleeding quite dramatically. I'd never had an accident so dramatic before: thankfully, my partner was great in handling the situation. Long story short, I got away without stitches, but was badly swollen &amp; bruised, as well as the cut. All round, not a lot of fun!!!\n\nOnce home, I didn't get a mirror and look down there, because (I think quite fairly) I didn't want to freak myself out. However, I *was* monitoring my pain, the feelings in my body, and watching for any sign of infection, etc.\n\nToday I had a checkup at the hospital, and I got the all clear: there's still bruising, but the cut is healing well, and no cause for concern. I phoned my parents to update them on this. My Dad said: \"Now that you're better, I can say this...\" And listed off that it was silly of me not to have looked at the injury with a mirror earlier, in case of infection. And also that it \"wasn't clever\" of me to have been standing the way I did when I fell.\n\nAnd I said *nothing*. I mean, clearly I'm pissed-off enough to want to post this here, but in the moment I didn't feel the need to react to him. And that feels like a victory. I *could've* said that, weirdly enough, I didn't *intend* to smash up my privates (!!!) But I didn't need to say that to him. I guess I'm old enough now to let him be the one who apparently has to know best. He's not going to change, and he probably didn't intend to be condescending. It's probably sad, too, that I don't/can't expect more of him.\n\nHe's fallen over and injured himself multiple times, and I've never once suggested that \"wasn't clever\" of him. It's interesting that my job as a daughter has always been to say sympathetically, \"Oh no, that must have been sore\", whereas his as a father is apparently to say \"You shouldn't have been in that situation\".\n\nI'm leaning childfree, and one reason I feel good about that is that (hopefully) I'll never think it's my job to tell a younger person that they were silly for hurting themselves. I'll try not to treat injury as a 'teachable moment', because I know I don't have the authority to be anyone else's teacher. Experience will teach them, just as it has taught me. And if I'm more carefully the next time I'm standing near firewood -- which I will be -- it won't be because of anything my father said to me.",
