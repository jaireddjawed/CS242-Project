        "text": "There will be spoilers.\n\nRight. So, I'm sure this book has already been talked to death, but I just finished it and no one I know personally has read it for me to talk to.\n\nI didn't realize when I ordered it that it was originally in Spanish. I probably would have just tried to find a Spanish copy if I'd known, because I found the writing itself to be...not bad, but also not great. Maybe it's just the translation?\n\nI got pretty tired of the thing where Marcos keeps ascribing physical attributes to people's words. It was poetic the first couple times, but eventually I just didn't need to know anymore that everyone's words were like icy lava, etc.\n\nAlso, the book just tried too hard to be disgusting and pushed my suspension of disbelief too far. Why would it be ok to torture 'heads' to death or eat them bit-by-bit while keeping them alive? That isn't even acceptable now with actual livestock. Even if humans were being kept as meat, how would all of society all at once throw all concern about about animal welfare out the window?\n\nThese events aren't happening hundreds of years after The Transition; they're happening fairly soon after and it's very hard to believe that everyone instantly flipped a switch and adopted this attitude that heads are disgusting, etc. Again, a feeling most people don't even have about actual livestock.\n\nIt would have made the book a bit more interesting to me if only one country had started this and it caused them to be isolated from the rest of the Global community, like Gilead in The Handmaid's Tale. Countries can't agree with one another on anything, yet they'd all agree that humans are food?\n\nI also didn't appreciate the twist ending, which just felt contrived and forced to me. \n\nThis novel felt like half an idea to me. It could have been good, but so much of it just felt like nonsense.\n\nI started 'The Remains of the Day' by Kazuo Ishiguro immediately after finishing this one and even just on page one the writing was already so much better in that hard-to-articulate way that it was a breath of fresh air.",

When a book goes on describing a person or a place I tend to tune out. I don't think I've ever read a comedy book, something about the concept repulses me for some reason. But other than that I'm not really set on a theme. I tend to enjoy an alt history story but I have been reading a bit more fantasy recently.\n\nI would want to read something with a pan-historical setting, showing a place or a world that is changing over time, and seeing how characters actions in the past affect the setting of the future. This is what I would like to read.\n\nSo what do you all enjoy and what would you like to read?",

        "text": "Just finished this book. I could say a lot more but to start, I think this book is one of the most important non-Fiction works of the 21st Century and I think everyone with even a passing interest in global politics and world history should read it. I know, for myself, that I wish I had heard of it and read it sooner. For having being written in 2009 and updated in 2014, I think Martin Jacques was broadly correct in his assessment of how the rise of China would profoundly change the rest of the planet.\n\nIt remains to be seen if China will truly surpass the United States but the world of ‘contested’ modernity that Martin Jacques describes in his book seems to be very much coming to fruition today. \n\nThe concept of the ‘civilization-state’ and its distinction from the Westphalian Nation-State remains very relevant today and I still read articles in places like Noemamag by people as distinguished as Bruno Macaes or Shashi Tharoor debating its validity. One only has to look at modern India, and see the ongoing debate within the country between its RSS/BJP government which wants Western technology and science but not the values alongside them and its opposition who feel that India’s founding values of Nehruvian/Gandhism/Ambedkarism from 1947 were not imposed upon Indians but authentically chosen by them. \n\nThe book’s greatest strength is how thoroughly Jacques supplements his arguments. Together the bibliography and appendix are ~200 pages or so. This greatly adds to the depth and seriousness of the arguments Jacques is making. \n\nI could say a lot more but mostly I just hope you really consider reading this book even if you disagree with it’s conclusions or find them uncomfortable.",

        "text": "So I think books that are mainly journeys like mentioned in the title are plot devices for when you don’t have a plot. They’re just there so characters have something to do otherwise yiur books would be 50 pages long cause the authors can’t think of what to put between events so they just put walking. And even when walking the characters develment isn’t good\n\nI’m mainly thinking of LOTR, Godkiller and Eragon.\n\nThe first 200 pages of LOTR is a walking simulator. And when 1/5 of the book is describing what kind of road they’re on with no character moments it’s poor in my opinion \n\nSame points with Eragon and Godkiller\n\nThe book that kinda subverts this is before they are hanged. Joe Abercrombie as written in a journey with a wizard and it end up being completely pointless. However the character development and moments are amazing",

Since then, we have removed suggestion threads and directed their posters to this thread instead.  This tradition continues, so let's jump right in!\n\n**The Rules**\n\n* Every comment in reply to this self-post must be a request for suggestions.\n\n* All suggestions made in this thread must be direct replies to other people's requests. Do not post suggestions in reply to this self-post.\n\n* All unrelated comments will be deleted in the interest of cleanliness.\n\n____\n\n**How to get the best recommendations**\n\nThe most successful recommendation requests include a description of the kind of book being sought.  This might be a particular kind of protagonist, setting, plot, atmosphere, theme, or subject matter.  You may be looking for something similar to another book (or film, TV show, game, etc), and examples are great!  Just be sure to explain *what* you liked about them too.

Evelyn did kill but not with force but her looks, people desired to be with her and would have killed to have one night with her.\n\nThe novel was extremely entertaining and the author had done a magnificent job in writing the story of Evelyn Hugo.",

The writing is mediocre at best for a lot of these books, there often isn’t a clear plot outside of the relationship and smut (in romance category books), and there is hardly any meaningful character development. Maybe I just need to branch out some more, but it feels like a lot of novels published in the last 7-8 years that are marketed for young adults (~16-22 years) just aren’t written well.\n\n(This discussion is mainly about tiktok recommendations and the popularity of these books despite the mediocre writing)",

        "text": "What are some so-called 'Classic books' that you see overrated? (if none for classic, maybe highly praised, popular best sellers)\n\nWhether you see it overrated subjectively (as a matter of taste/personal view) or objectively or both, it would depend but still, regardless of that, it would be a hot take (controversial) since the general acception is that it's a classic. So, let's not be offended by other's opinion in this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-----------------\n\npersonally\n\n1. Moby Dick - too much unnecessary description of whale hunting. Needs a lot of editing, trimming, I couldn't finish it. (The Old man and The Sea is better)\n2. The Catcher in the Rye - I used to love it when I read it in high school, but maybe I got old or became one of those phonies, I just view him (and it being about) a typical cynical teenage edgelord who doesn't want to grow up.\n3. The Great Gatsby - It's very good (broken American dream), but sometimes a bit too overrated as if it's the peak literature, it ain't that deep in my opinion (like, compared to Dostoevsky).\n4. Jane Eyre - I know some would hate me for this, but even though it's a pioneer work for an independent women, I thought it had limitations with her limiting to Rochester. (though from her sister Bronte, love Wuthering Heights) \n5. Jane Austin's books - like the above, some would hate me for this, but  felt like flowery writing which lacks depth, uniqueness in the story for today's standard. \n6. The Chronicles of Narnia - don't know if it's a classic, but basically seems like  gospel.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTMI) I hate books like 'The Alchemist', 'The Secret', being very obvious.",

I understand not every postmodern books have to be insanely ambitious works like Infinity Jest or Gravity’s Rainbow, there are plenty of readable and more accessible postmodernist fiction. In my opinion American Psycho, Slaughterhouse Five, Kafka on the Shore, and Blood Meridian are all books that manage to stay somewhat within convention but still manage to be exciting and undoubtedly within the postmodernist genre, whereas Fight Club was just kinda like, um, cool story bro. It may just be that i never liked this book or movie, which i dont really, or maybe it was groundbreaking for its time. I personally dont think that fight club is anywhere near the same level as a lot of postmodernist or even modernist lit, id be interested in anyone opinion on the subject or thoughts on whats great about the book",

The first one was a bit complicated and articulate but still very understandable. The second one was just bullshit basic novel that I hated a lot. I just cannot bring myself to read more novels just to be disappointed by the plot or ending, so I have finally decided I was ready to dive into what I’m really intrigued by, which is dark philosophy. \n\nI thought I was a grandmaster at english but holy fuck… this book just showed me the insane it can be. The vocabulary used is just not familiar at all. I keep finding myself trying to figure out what a lot of the sentences mean by context and not by words and it’s driving me crazy. I cannot keep pulling out my phone to look up a meaning of a word it just takes the serenity out of reading. \n\nI’m sure someone has had trouble with this before, so could anyone let me know how to go about this?",

As a result I have a lot of books that I was supposed to read, but didn't, which makes me feel bad. So I decided to take things into my own hands read them all, or all the ones I can remember anyways. The first on this list was Jon Krakauer's Into the Wild, which I was supposed to read my Junior year in AP English.  \n\n\nI actually read it in 2022 towards the end, and only just now thought to post about my quest. Honestly, this was one of my favorite reads of 2022! Krakauer is definitely a good writer, and the subject matter was gripping. I loved following Alex across America, hearing how he touched the lives of so many people in a way that most of us could only dream of! This is one of my top ten books of all times now, and I'm so sad I didn't read this when I was supposed to. I highly recommend this book, and I'm not even typically a nonfiction person (nothing against it, just not what I usually reach for). I'll definitely need to check out more of Krakauer's works!  \n\n\nFor anyone wondering, here is the list as of right now. Occasionally I'll remember another thing I was supposed to read so this list isn't definitive but its all that I'm aware of right now:  \n*Adventures of Huckleberry Finn* by Mark Twain (Honors Sophomore English)  \n*Wuthering Heights\\** by Emily Bronte (Honors Sophmore English)  \nAssorted Edgar Allen Poe poems (AP Junior English)  \n*Educated by* Tera Westover (AP Junior English)  \n*Frankenstein* by Marry Shelly (AP Senior English)  \n*The Handmaid's Tale* by Margaret Atwood (AP Senior English)  \n*Carnage and Culture\\*\\** by Victor Davis Hanson (AP US History)  \n*Native American Studies* by Clara Sue Kidwell (Native American History, college)  \n*Identity Crisis* by John M. Sides et. all (Intro to government, college)  \n\\*Technically not an assigned reading but an extra credit novel I gave up on. Still counting it.   \n\\*\\*I read the one chapter we needed to, planning to read the entire book.",

It has sometimes taken me weeks to parse through books a fifth of it's size, though admittedly mostly not YA and more dense.\n\nI honestly think the ease of which things happened for the characters and the predictability was a very intentional decision in order to stage the whopper of an ending in the next novel. Any twist I didn't outright predict, felt like a lock clicking into place \"...how didn't I see that??\"\n\nI really like how trauma is represented as well, and I found it entirely authentic and relatable. Fiercely righting all the wrongs you have experience and see with nearly blind conviction, despite the consequencs, and constantly being proven your way is is the only way every time you hesitate and it come back to bite you in the ass.\n\nI was rare for me to disagree with any of Zetian's choices knowing what she has experienced; even when I would find myself pleading with her to believe that there is good in people, that not everyone moves with ulterior motives. I still could not blame her or saw the justice in her choices.\n\nI'm very excited for Heavenly Tyrant and I hope it's just as compelling and exciting as Iron Widow.\n\nP.S.: I absolutely loved how the triad unfolded, it felt true to life and though I'm sad about The Incident, I'm hoping book 2 can mend that lil hole.",
