And I do like talking about religion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI asked which religion is the most logical one, and the ai said that \"as a language model it cannot endorse one religion over the other.\"\n\nand then at some point, it said \" Some religions prioritize faith and spirituality, while others emphasize reason and logic.  Ultimately, the decision of which religion to follow or which approach to spirituality to take is a personal one, and should be based on individual beliefs, values, and experiences.\"\n\nAnd I go  \"you said \"Some religions prioritize faith and spirituality, while others emphasize reason and logic.\"  which religions prioritize faith and spirituality instead of reason and logic?\"\n\nAnd it gave me the big three as the answer, that they were more faith-based.\n\nThen I asked  \"you said \"Some religions prioritize faith and spirituality, while others emphasize reason and logic.\" which religion emphasizes reason and logic more than others? \"\n\nthe ai answered; \" Buddhism, Taoism, Humanism\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBlind faith and human logic.

My question is- When do you think Jesus's crucifixion is going to happen, if at all?\n\nDo you think the final episode will end with the crucifixion About to happen, or will they actually show it in the finale? Or, do you think perhaps the crucifixion will happen at the end of like Seasons 5 or 6 and the rest will show Jesus's ressurection, ascension, and the entirety of the book of Acts with everything abruptly coming to a hault at the end? Or do you think they might actually show Paul writing his letters?\n\nOne thing I can say, is that I don't think they'll go as far as to show the book of Revelations. Not only does that not seem to be in their budget, but I can't imagine it fitting really well with the rest of the show.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/religion/comments/1194emu/the_old_testament_and_black_history_monthpart_3/",
        "text": "This is part 3 of a series of posts I've done on the Old Testament and Black History Month. To be clear these posts have focused primarily on how black slaves and black people in general in the diaspora have read the Old Testament and applied it to their circumstances. So its centering their experiences. Here I'm going to focus on how the story of Joseph and his twelve brothers had a major appeal for blacks in the coming out of the Transatlantic slave trade in terms of explaining their circumstances and in their general fight for justice and liberation.\n\n**(1)Betrayal and being sold by one's own:**\n\n***Verse:*** \"*Judah said to his brothers, 'What will we gain by killing our brother? We'd have to cover up the crime. Instead of hurting him, lets sell him to those Ishmaelite traders. After all he is our brother-our own flesh and blood!' And the brothers agreed. So when the Ishmaelites, who were Midianite traders, came by, Joseph's brothers pulled him out of the cistern and sold him to them for twenty pieces of silver. And the traders took him to Egypt*\"(Genesis 37:26-28)\n\n* The tragic and unfortunate part of the transatlantic slave trade is this. Even though it was largely a European enterprise used to develop the colonies of the Americas after the population decline of the indigenous peoples of the Americas, with Europeans dragging them across the Middle Passage, African empires and tribes participated and were complicit in it.\n* They were complicit firstly because there was already a pre-existing African slave trade that existed before the Transatlantic one. When the Europeans came and settled on the ports and outskirts of the continent the Columbian exchange and the Triangular trade was established whereby in exchange for selling war captives or those one captured by raiding a nearby village or town, one was guaranteed guns, resources and gun powder that one could add in one's militaristic arsenal to then wage war on competing kingdoms and empires. The desire for guns and gunpowder became their twenty pieces of silver. And those in the black diaspora reflecting on the calamity that befell them would see in the Biblical narrative an important parallel to their own fate.\n\n**(2)Potiphar's wife. The parallels with the slave master's wife and white women in the interactions of black men when it comes to sexual advances and the accusation of rape**\n\n***Verse:*** \"*She kept putting pressure on Joseph day after day, but he refused to sleep with her, and he kept out of her way as much as possible. One day, however, no one else was around when he went in to do his work. She came and grabbed him by his cloak, demanding 'Come on, sleep with me!' Joseph tore himself away, but he left his cloak in her hand as he ran from the house. When she saw that she was holding his cloak and he fled, she called out to her servants. Soon all the men came running. 'Look!' she said. 'My husband has brought this Hebrew slave here to make fools of us! He came into my room to rape me, but I screamed. When he heard me scream, he ran outside and got away, but he left his cloak behind me!' She kept the cloak with her until her husband came home. Then she told him her story. 'That Hebrew slave you've brought into our house tried to come in and fool around with me' she said. 'But when I screamed, he ran outside, leaving his cloak with me!*'\"(Genesis 39:10-18)\n\n* If there was ever a story that black men on the plantations of the African slave trade in Caribbean and the Americas, as well as post slavery in a racist society could identify with, its this. Because it described their experiences with the slave master's wife and white women in general. They were sexually fetishized by the slave master's wife. But at the same time they were also demonised as sexual predators. And that demonisation as sexual predators was weaponised as an instrument of power and domination. It was done both by the slave master's wife, and the slave masters themselves and general society who sought to \"keep them in their place\" due to a fear of their potential power. As a result, on the plantations, false accusations of rape could be quite deadly, leading to severe lashes and beatings at best, and outright murder at worst. This pattern would continue even after slavery was abolished where black men where often times accused, sentenced to prison and given the death sentence over false accusations of rape. Most infamously we see this with the outrages of the KKK which saw themselves as defending the \"honor\" of white women against the black rapist and black sexual predator as they saw it, resulting in some of the most brutal lynchings and human rights abuses and murders which goes right up to incidents like the murder of Emmett Till. So this verse in religious form described a centuries long experience that black men identified with.",

I also remember floating on the Caribbean sea, feeling the sun, wind, water, salt... all together and I felt so close to God.\n\nThe sad thing about those seconds is that I don't know when they will return, if they will return at all. I think Hindus call it moksha, maybe it is close to that, and yet I would expect it to be a more stable experience. Drugs may cause these experiences, but the advantage of these spiritual experiences is that you get the full feeling and also keep all awareness and beingness.\n\nIt is clear you don't need to be religious to have a religious or spiritual experience, but it seems it is useful for some people to get terms and describe better their experiences.",

        "author": "Anglicanpolitics123",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/religion/comments/117tky9/the_old_testament_and_black_history_monthpart_2/",
        "text": "This is part 2 of a series of posts I am doing on the intersection between the Old Testament and black history, since its black history month. For this one I'm going to focus on the Babylonian Exile as a theme and metaphor. So in both Biblical and as well as general history, the Babylonian Exile refers to the events of 587 B.C when the armies of the Babylonian Empire under Nebuchadnezzar II invaded the Kingdom of Judah, conquered Jerusalem, pillaged it, enslaved the population, and then forced them into exile through a systematic policy of population transfer and ethnic cleansing. In the Black spiritual and political traditions of the diaspora, Babylon became a important metaphor for the systematic oppression they faced in their struggle for liberation. Key texts when referring to the Babylonian Exile as well as how it was used in the black political tradition are the following:\n\n1. Psalm 137\n2. Jeremiah 50-51\n3. Daniel 1-3, 6\n4. The Book of Ezra\n\n**(1)Surviving the indignity of captivity in a foreign land**\n\n***Text:*** \"By the rivers of Babylon, we sat and wept as we thought of Jerusalem. We put away our harps, hanging them on the branches of poplar trees. For our captors demanded a song from us. Our tormentors insisted on a joyful hymn: 'Sing us one of those songs of Jerusalem!' But how can we sing songs of the Lord while in a pagan land?\"(Psalm 137:1-4)\n\n* If there were ever a set of verses that ring out a lot in the Black spiritual traditions of the African American tradition as well as those in the Caribbean, its this. \"By the rivers of Babylon\" is something that became major in the hymns of black culture and black spirituality because it expressed the collective trauma and anguish of blacks who were slaves and their descendants.\n* The Israelites have been ripped from their home land in Jerusalem and forced into a foreign land in Babylon as captives. In a similar manner blacks were ripped from their homeland and forced into foreign lands in the Americas as slaves and captives. The Israelites, in addition to going through physical suffering, suffered the mental anguish that their captors put them through by saying \"sing us a song\". That directly reflected the black experience where not only did they suffering physical torture both in the Middle Passage as well as the plantation system, but they suffer the mental torture of their captors who regularly said \"sing for me\" \"dance for me\".\n* Because of these experiences, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, the Caribbean and all over where the plantation system was prevalent was their \"river of Babylon\" where they wept. Where they wept for Africa their homeland just as the Israelites wept for Jerusalem. Where they wept for all the millions who died in the Middle Passage of the Atlantic ocean. And where they understood that they were in a modern day social Babylon, built on repression and injustice. The systems of the United States and the various European Empires that profited from the Transatlantic slave trade and racial oppression where Babylonian in nature.\n\n**(2)Struggling to preserve one's identity and struggling against repression**\n\n***Text:*** \"Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah were four of the young men chosen, all from the tribe of Judah. The chief of staff renamed them with these Babylonian names: Daniel was called Belteshazzar. Hananiah was called Shadrach. Mishael was called Meshach. Azariah was called Abednego. But Daniel was determined not to defile himself by eating the food and wine given to them by the king. He asked the chief of staff for permission not to eat these unacceptable foods\"(Daniel 2:6-8)\n\n***Text:*** \"Nebuchadnezzar was so furious with Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego that his face became distorted with rage. He commanded that the furnace be heated seven times hotter than usual. Then he ordered some of the strongest men of his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego and throw them into the blazing furnace\"(Daniel 3:19-20)\n\n* What we see in the texts above is firstly Daniel and his friends being forced to abandon their Hebrew names and take on Babylonian names, the names of their captors. That is directly analogous to the experience of blacks coming off the slave trade and they saw it. They were forced to abandon their African names and culture and take on the names of their slave masters, a legacy that has left its imprint for centuries. Yet even in these circumstances Daniel sought to preserve his identity and beliefs and it was the same for blacks in what they considered to be a modern Babylon.\n* The image of Daniel being thrown into the fiery furnace was also one that appealed to blacks as well. For defying the King, he was thrown into the oven. Yet even in the oven, he and his friends in Daniel 3 sing a song of praise in defiance of the King. That image of defying one's oppressors, and being able to sing sacred spirituals of freedom appealed to blacks in the Caribbean and African Americans who sung freedom songs in the social hell they had to live while defying their masters.\n\n**(3)Freedom and liberation from Babylonian like systems. Judgement on captors and captivity**\n\n***Text:*** \"This is what the Lord of Heaven's armies says: 'The people of Israel and Judah have been wronged. Their captors hold them and refuse to let them go. But the one who redeems them is strong. His name is the Lord of Heaven's armies. He will defend and give them rest against in Israel. But for the people of Babylon there will be no rest\"(Jeremiah 50:33-34)\n\n***Text:*** \"And I will punished Bel, the god of Babylon, and make him vomit up all he has eaten. The names will no longer come and worship him. The wall of Babylon has fallen\"(Jeremiah 51:44)\n\n* The image that we see here is the impact of captives being liberated from their captive and judgement being brought on the power who have taken them captive. This would obviously appeal to blacks, whether its African Americans, black Canadians coming out of the Underground railroad movement, or black in the Caribbean because they drew the parallels to their liberation struggles. They would also be liberated from slavery and captivity, and their captors, whether American or European, would face judgement for the oppressive system they established. In fact in the lead up the American Civil War, the destruction that was wrought was seen by black slaves as God's wrath on America. And just as how God's wrath on Babylon was good news for the captive Israelites, God's wrath on American plantation owners, or their oppressors in the European empires was good news to the slaves and to the oppressed.\n* We also see the image of Bel, the God of Babylon \"vomiting out\" the people conquered by Babylon. Bel would have represented the ideology of the Babylonians that was used to justify conquest, imperialism, subjugation, and exploitation of the nations of the earth. In the same way how Bel is forced to vomit, or \"disgorge\" in some translations, the systems of racism and white supremacy established by the American and European political systems of domination and empire would be forced to \"vomit out\" its victims, especially the children and descendants of the African slave trade so they would be freed.\n\n**(4)Being able to journey back to ones homeland, and or rebuild**\n\n***Text:*** \"In the first year of King Cyrus of Persia, the Lord fulfilled the prophecy he had given through Jeremiah. He stirred the heart of Cyrus to put this proclamation in writing and to send it throughout his kingdom: 'This is what King Cyrus of Persia says: The Lord the God of heaven has given me all the kingdoms of the earth. He has appointed me to build him a Temple at Jerusalem, which is in Judah. Any of you who are his people may go to Jerusalem in Judah to rebuild this Temple in Jerusalem\"(Ezra 1:1-3)\n\n* We see the image of captives being able to go back to their homelands and rebuild. That image of either \"going back\" or \"rebuilding\" would have a strong influence in the black political tradition generally, and the black nationalist tradition specifically. The tradition of \"going back\" to one's homeland had a big influence on slaves who returned back to Africa to establish states such as Liberia and Sierra Leone. The tradition of \"rebuilding\" after being captives would have a big impact on slaves who were just freed after emancipation, whether its the emancipation decree of the British Empire, or the Emancipation proclamation of the United States.\n\nSo these are just some ways the theme of the Babylonian Exile influenced black history.",

All throughout the gospels you see proof against the trinity. God is not a spirit of confusion if he were a tri omni being he would have told his people when he first spoke to them or do christians think the ancient Israelites are so stupid they wouldnt understand? He said he was one. Christians commonly use John 1:1 as proof for the trinity (one of the FEW verses that they use as support while convinienlty ignoring the HUNDREDS of verses that go agaisnt it.) This user explains John 1 in a logical coherent way that lines up with the rest of the Bible.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAChristian/comments/10z8xyu/based_solely_on_the_language_used_in_john_11/\n\nThey ignore the verses that say Jesus prayed to God and said your (God) will be done not mine. Or the one that says \"I am returning to my Father and your Father, my God and your God.\" Christians say Jesus is God, so God has a God and is returning to him? Does anyone of this make sense? Its glaringly obvious Jesus is not God he clearly said he was returning to my God and your God when speaking to his disciples. Guys the Bible cant get much clearer than this. All throughout the gospels Jesus talks about God the Father and the Kingdom of Heaven, he directs to worship and pray to God the Father not himself. So why do people pray to Jesus today and not his Father like he directed them? Why would Jesus pray to himself, why would he return to himself? In the the book of revelation it says after he ascended Jesus sits at the right hand of the Father until he comes back to earth to pass judgment and establish his kingdom. If he was God why is there a consistent a distinction made between Jesus and God? Is Jesus sitting next to himself? I dont understand how people can be so blind. Why do christians think this strange demonic doctrine is fundamental to being a christian? \n\nThey have been fooled. Muslims and Jews worship the same God of Abraham as a singular being. Only the christians lost and foolish think they have newly revealed knowledge that that God is a trinity when the same people who have been with him since their nation was formed reject it and the muslims reject it. The Bible rejects it. God is not a trintiy in the Torah he says \"Hear oh Israel the Lord your God is one\" was he lying to them you think he would have told them if he was actually three. The trinity is nonsense and no one understands it.",

        "text": "In my faith it seems the purpose of this World is to choose. You either choose God's path or choose to go your own way. In a sense this reality is made for anyone to be able to freely choose either without huge consequences in this life, and all judgment (even for great evils) is relied to a final judgment, so it works like a safe sandbox but with spiritual consequences that echo for eternity. We don't believe life is a test, although it is full of them. This life is to be enjoyed, yet it is only a slice of a greater divine journey of the soul.\n\nWhat your religion believes this world is for? It seems often religions avoid this question or don't put much emphasis on it, probably because often people don't think about it as much as it seems, or they prefer to focus on the blessings and rituals of the faith. Even religions without focus on the afterlife seem to focus far more on the God(s) than this question.",

Starting notice the change in pattern for women’s thought process and decision making as of late.\n\nThe general consensus is, women are too sexually arousing, and it is prefered if she veiled her herself entirely from men’s sight. Furthermore, it is prefered that men would limit their interactions entirely with women, as to not engage with flirting or other sexual engagements. \n\nThis is true for myself, as I used to play with my cousin a lot during my childhood, as we used to play , talk, have many conversations.\nBut after that, both of us hit puberty. Everything was limited. I’m currently 23 , and the last time I remember interacting with her, was like somthing around 9 years old. I genuinely haven’t spoken to her,  let alone a saying a simple hello.\n\n It’s the fear of my how my surroundings would react if they saw me laughing or too engaged with her. So I avoided her for most of the time to also avoid trouble, and I’m pretty sure she did the same. \n\nIt’s pretty obvious that most women are now wearing half baked hijabs, exposing their hair. Not really wearing them as they’re supposed like in the past.  \n\nSome have entirely discarded their veil , some go with it just to show off for  their families and some don’t care really how they wear it as long as they do. \n\nNo matter how I look at it, I can’t find a reasonable way to view women in the 20th century with Islamic thought. \n\nIslam does not provide a solution to women, and only limits their movements, gives them very few options, makes sure that men has the last say at every decision. \n\nPersonally, I no longer have a heart for this religion, and I also don’t think it’s possible to practice it at every time and place.\n\nIslam seems to me, just another man made religion, Done to organize the masses.
