        "text": "Apologies out front in the event that I'm simply overthinking/missing a simple idea, but I was wondering how it's currently believed that black holes go about merging?  It's a process I see get referenced quite often, but I struggle to wrap my head around what that entails.  To my *truly* limited understanding, the nature of a black hole is that the point in space has collapsed in a way where matter that \"falls\" into the point has essentially crossed a boundary from which it can never escape back out of.\n\nNow when two black holes merge, do the contents of these points (which to my understanding were wholly and absolutely isolated from one another) suddenly mix into the same pool?  Does the \"smaller\" black hole stay in-tact, simply existing as it had previously but now simply trapped within the larger black hole, creating an inception of black holes all the way down so to speak?",

        "text": "Why dont  rovers that rely on solar energy as main power source have a way of cleaning dust without having to wait for wind gusts?\n\nObviously there's a reason for it, but I just cant think why wouldn't they install a 9$ dust wiper? Is it because it takes too much energy to power?",

        "text": "When people are talking about the theory about us living in a Black Hole, do they mean that we would be on to \"wall\" of the black hole. By that I mean if viewing the gravity well from the side are we are on the nearly vertical part and the singularity is outside the observable universe and our observable universe is only a small fraction of the entire black hole, or do they mean our observable universe is a large fraction of the black hole and the edge is the event horizon or close to it. \n\nIf it's the former wouldn't that mean we would expect assemetrical expansion of our observable universe with much more stretching/expansion occurring in the direction pointing towards the center.\n\nIf it's the latter wouldn't that mean that their is a singularity sorta close to us that we would expect to see wicked gravitational lensing around?",
