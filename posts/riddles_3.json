        "text": "Here’s why the maid did it and how she wasn’t caught until her statement. \n\nThe wife was cheating on Mr. Smith with the butler because the butler only thinks about getting wine for the wife and he already knows her favorite so he must be spending a lot of time with a drunk Mrs. Smith. She was only unfaithful because Mr. Smith is unopenly gay and is having a secret affair with the gardener. The gardener and husband were hiding the fact that they were together at the time of Mrs. Smith death to keep Mr. Smith’s secret because Mr. And Mrs. Smith are elderly and have old fashioned values. The maid discovering that Mrs. Smith is unfaithful and realized that she couldn’t be punished because adultery is legal in England. I assume they’re in England because of their name Smith. The maid discovered the affair because she had an eye out for the butler and admired him from a far. The maid easily over powered the elderly Mrs. Smith and killed her for taking the one she loves. But the reason she was caught so easily was because the table obviously wasn’t set for dinner. The table wasn’t set because the maid was too busy getting rid of all the evidence. Therefore, the chef is the only genuine person in the house and comes to the cops first to make his statement because he is a truth-teller. Mr. Smith’s and the gardener’s statements coming next because they are each others alibi and probably decided together what they would say. The maid came next because she was trying to come up with an alibi and totally failed. And finally the butler because he was truly in love with Mrs. Smith and was grieving too much to make his statement earlier. The alibi’s also have meanings. The chef’s one shows that he took his job seriously and genuinely liked his job. The husband likes telescopes and is secretly gay. That connects to the NASA purge of homosexuals by James Webb. The deep-space telescope is named after James and people are furious about that homophobe taking the glory. The gardener’s alibi symbolizes how the family tree should remove some branches because he wishes he could be on it next to Mr. Smith. The maids alibi represents how she was trying to set things right by killing Mrs. Smith and how organized her plan was. And finally the butler’s alibi represented how intimate his love for Mrs. Smith was. I think the moral of the story is that love is more complicated when you lie.",
