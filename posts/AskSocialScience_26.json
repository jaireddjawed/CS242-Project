        "text": "Seriously curious about this. Searches for gay porn have been shown to be more prevalent in cultures that hold more homophobic beliefs (the Middle East and American South, for example). It seems fairly intuitive that fetishes are often born out of cultural taboo, restriction and stigma.\n\nWithout getting too pseudo-Freudian about it, I always thought Japan's unusual fetishes, particularly around hyper-violence was an outlet for the Japanese stigma on male aggressiveness (I have no explanation for Octopus porn) and Germany's unusual penchant for scat porn was an outlet for German culture's value of 'Ordnung' (orderliness, cleanliness, etc.), an anal expulsive response to an anal retentive society (maybe).\n\nI did some deep sociological research browsing the top categories of Pornhub and am convinced the western world's cultural fetish is jailbait...for better of worse. The top category is \"teens\" and it filled with 18-year-old-girls obviously made to look younger, wearing school girl uniforms, braces sucking on suckers and all the general Lolita-esque semiotics you'd expect. Also, in search engines, searches for 'jailbait' and similarly sketchy search terms are disturbingly high amongst overall porn searches.",

It's also the prime thread for requesting books or articles on a particular subject. As with all our weekly features (Theory Wednesdays and Friday Free-For-Alls are the others), this thread will be lightly moderated.\n\nSo, encountered an recently that changed article recently that changed how you thought about nationalism? Or pricing? Or anxiety? Cross-cultural communication? Did you have to read a horrendous piece of mumbo-jumbo that snuck through peer-review and want to tell us about how bad it was? Need help finding the literature on topic Y and don't even know how where to start? Is there some new trend in the literature that you're noticing and want to talk about? Then this is the thread for you!\n",

Are you familia with any studies trying to do so?  \n\nStudying it using quantitative methods, I would have access to a lot of data on inequality like http://wid.world . I would on the other side have a hard time eliminating any spurious correlations. I know this is a problem in almost every quantitative studies in social science, but the problems seems to mere quite servere here? How can I ever prove that ones wealth is based upon others poorness? \nIf I were to study it using more qualitative methods, I would be using something like process tracing, I guess. But Im having a hard time to see how it could be formed. \n\nWhat is your take? How would you study a theory like this one empirically?",

The accuracy of these techniques are highly dependent on the variables used as estimators. You can train a classifier to fit a training set very well based on the variables used to train the algorithm, but if these variables aren't relevant to making good estimations, it would fit the test set very badly.

The prison itself is absurdly abusive and is literally slavery - down to black men who are owned by the state farming cash crops while being watched by armed guards called \"freemen\", until recently presided over by [Burl Cain](https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3c/Warden_Burl_Cain_St_Francisville.jpg/1200px-Warden_Burl_Cain_St_Francisville.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burl_Cain&amp;h=1499&amp;w=1200&amp;tbnid=dN6UUexXJtQrDM:&amp;tbnh=186&amp;tbnw=148&amp;usg=__6romOwhUKGC8h1us9x5QqtH0P9w=&amp;vet=10ahUKEwiBwMOBtc7WAhUCj1QKHd-KAp8Q_B0IeTAK..i&amp;docid=EPLVI9JziaefBM&amp;itg=1&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiBwMOBtc7WAhUCj1QKHd-KAp8Q_B0IeTAK&amp;ei=1FfQWYGGKYKe0gLflYr4CQ) (can you imagine someone who looks more like they'd love owning people? I can't.)\n\nEach year they have a rodeo there that prisoners participate in - they do the rodeo events and many sell art/handmade goods. It's a bunch of white, trump supporting Louisianans watching primarily back men risk life and limb for a few bucks (gladiators much?).\n\nFrom my description I obviously wouldn't go for the entertainment of it, but here's the issue: my wife wants to go to see this thing that we kind of can't believe actually happens. Many other people have said that the inmates love this event, that they work all year preparing for it, and work for years to get trusted access to be able to interact with community members. The money mostly goes to them (80% directly to them from purchases) and to resources they use (libraries etc) - and the hundreds of inmates that participate obviously see it as better than the alternatives.\n\nThat said, I sort of feel that it's disaster tourism - that it's riding a bus through the lower 9 after Katrina, or visiting one of those segregated restaurants in the 60's (not to protest, but just to have a sandwich at the lunch counter).\n\nAm I overthinking this or inflating my own sense of importance here? Is the Angola Rodeo a net positive, or is my attendance just helping perpetuate a disaster of a system?\n",

Is there any scientific reason to use these terms interchangeably or is that simply a result of laypeople colloquially using the terms related to \"gender\"?\n\n\nAdditionally, is the concept of gender identity scientifically valid? How could a person know that they feel like a female if they're in a male body or vice versa? As a person in a male body, I don't know what being female feels like, therefore how could I possibly conclude that I feel female? Heck, it seems possible to argue that I don't know what being male feels like and that I'm really a female trapped in a male body since I can't prove otherwise.\n\n\nThis seems to get even trickier once people start identifying as genders other than male or female.

Peace, in my view, is not the natural state (see Hobbes) and that in its fragility, should it break down, we return to a natural state of chaos in which hard power reigns supreme. Thus, hard power is still the most important power in international relations.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?",

It is high time to question this orthodoxy. Western colonialism was, as a general rule, both objectively beneficial and subjectively legitimate in most of the places where it was found, using realistic measures of those concepts. The countries that embraced their colonial inheritance, by and large, did better than those that spurned it. Anti-colonial ideology imposed grave harms on subject peoples and continues to thwart sustained development and a fruitful encounter with modernity in many places. Colonialism can be recovered by weak and fragile states today in three ways: by reclaiming colonial modes of governance; by recolonising some areas; and by creating new Western colonies from scratch.\n\nI was wondering whether this is truly novel or if it is a part of a bigger school of academic thought. How is it being received in social science circles? Is this convincing scholarship? I read the article through my university's library, but it isn't my field of expertise, so I'm genuinely curious.
