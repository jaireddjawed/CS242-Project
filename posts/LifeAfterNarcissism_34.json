        "text": "Today is my birthday.\n\nWe have been on and off for almost 9 months now but it has felt like a lifetime. He has broken up with me 4 times for terrible reasons, such as wanting to go visit his ex girlfriend or claiming I was having sex with coworkers (oh please), and I always take him back. He broke up with me for the last time a few days ago after going through my phone while I was asleep and proclaiming that I was sleeping with one of my coworkers. We had snapchatted each other and my coworker is merely a friend; however, this friend happens to be good looking, and that threatens every N. He woke me up to confront me, to which I asked him why he would go through my personal things when I had told him before he could look whenever he wanted with my permission. It's just wrong to go through someone's things like that and an absolute violation of privacy. He's done this before and swore he would never do it again, but as we know they can never respect boundaries or promises. He told me to \"get the fuck out\" of his house because he had \"caught\" me being shady and blocked me on every thing--my phone, Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat--without saying anything else.\n\nFast forward a few days and he unblocked my number to scream at me. For 3 hours I apologized for something I did not need to apologize for because I did not DO anything. I told him I loved him, I was there for him. He said I was selfish, toxic, and lowly. And then he blocked me again.\n\nNow, it is my birthday. He unblocked me last night around 2am to say, \"Sorry loveless-, I know this is awful timing, but this just isn't right.\" You know it's awful timing yet you also knew I would wake up on my birthday and see that. That's when I decided that I have had enough. I blocked his number and deleted it.\n\nI admit that I have been weak to him, his love and affection slowly morphing into an addiction for me over time. When I wake up in the morning, I think about him immediately. I look in the mirror and feel ugly and worn out, just like how he makes me feel. I realize now that in order to control you they have to knock you down until you feel so terrible about yourself that you would do ANYTHING to have them treat you like the angel they did during the love bombing stage. It's taken me 4 separate love bombs to finally understand that it isn't real, that everything he said was fake and to merely benefit himself. I am trying hard this time. I won't unblock his number. I won't give in. I hope.\n\nThere will never be a good time to walk away from something like this, but I want to preserve my birthday... and my heart. You only turn 27 once! Please, please, please send me a tiny prayer that I will get away from this monster once and for all.",

        "text": "Hi everyone, I have noticed a pattern going on in my life and I would like some insight.\n\nBack in HS, I was into design, HGTV shows, floor plans and politics.  My dad and I would go look at houses [even though we weren't in the market for houses].  There were a lot of new developments popping up everywhere, so we would go to whichever one piqued our interest.\n\nFast forward to college.  I went NC with the parents during my first year.  I completely lost interest in politics and anything having to do with design or floor plans.  I started dating this girl and got a group of friends.  We were into movies, board games, video games, martial arts, working out, volunteering and pizza nights.\n\nFast forward to my second year of college.  Somehow, my parents were able to reel me back in.  I became obsessed with politics again and started watching HGTV (again) and the food network.  I also started enjoying cooking...  So, you can see the trend.  When I'm with them or when they have any kind of influence on me, I gravitate toward politics and home-rearing stuff for some reason.\n\nNow, I'm NC with them again and have been for about a month.  I'm way less obsessed with politics, hate HGTV, don't watch the food network anymore.  I'm more into movies and beer and want a group of friends again.\n\nI sincerely want to figure this out.... Do you think politics and watching the home garden network was some kind of coping mechanism?",

        "text": "Hi everyone, I've gone NC with Nrents and Nsis this year and particularly after going NC with my Nfather I've found myself wanting to play the piano again and even to buy one so I can practice regularly. I used to play from 8-18, but it was always a key source of validation for my Nfather who was also a pianist. It was the centre of the enmeshment basically, and made me his envoy into the world. Everything I liked about it just proved to him that I was a carbon copy of him, not my own person. So after moving out I stopped playing and haven't regularly played for the last 20 or so years. \n\nIt feels like something in me wants it back again though, I've started going to a new church and I hear people play every week and have been reading muisc again when we sign the hymns. I think this is stirring something, and maybe because I am NC I'm starting to feel safe again about doing this for my own reasons. \n\nOnly trouble is when I did play the other day on a piano in a hotel, I think I got a bit of a panic reaction - lots of overwhelming energy. I also remembered things, like how he used to always sit and listen to me practice, even if I begged him to leave me alone - he paid for the lessons and so he had a right to listen whenever he wanted - more controlling behaviour. \n\nBasically I'm trying to decide how to work through this, if I should, and how to know whether you can actually make something thats a bit triggering your own again. Does anyone have any experience with this? ",

Because she is so into this series, I got her a couple things from etsy related to the series for her birthday. This isn't the problem, I think she'll be very happy!\n\nThe problem is, I don't really like this book series and I don't know how to approach that? I have read more of it since last hanging out with her, and I'll probably be done with it by the time I see her. I had already told her that I wasn't super into it, so she knows that much at least. I'm interested in seeing how it ends, but I find the main character really unlikable and I think the writer has some weird issues with certain kinds of people. &gt;_&lt; It's fine, I like the world building and I like reading... but definitely not going to be one of my favorite authors.\n\nI don't really know how to talk about this? I really have no examples about how to talk to someone who enjoys something a lot, that I don't enjoy all that much, without sounding like a killjoy. I'm sure she'll want to know more about what I thought of the book since she know's I've been reading it. She'll almost certainly want to talk about the book with me.\n\nUsually, I just avoid these situations. I don't say anything if I don't like something, but I don't think that will work in this situation. I don't want to pretend to like it, though, either. My extremely toxic friendships and toxic family has only taught me that if someone likes something that you don't like, you just make fun of them, and I know that isn't the right response.\n\nI'm sure I'm overthinking this... any advice, though? Or similar stories you've been through? Thanks.",

I try to have some relationships aside from my distance with my parents, but not many are interested. \n\nSend my cousin happy birthday wishes...nothing. Send a text letting them know I had sex reassignment surgery (she had known I'm transgender before and accepted me) with pics from Thailand. Nothing. :( :( I LOVED HER. Before my parental BS we were close, we hung closer at family gatherings than with anyone else.  We emotionally supported one another with our challenges. She was the first family member I came out to. Any time we were in town we would see each other and it felt like old friendship. now I might as well be last weeks junk mail. She's the closest thing I had to any sort of sister or sibling of any kind.  I don't have anyone, I'm an only child in an immediate family that feels more like a cult. Nobody seems interested in just listening to me or taking me at face value. If I'm not attached to my parents, well who cares about a dead limb? And My parents,  I'm their prized cat. That's about the nature of our relationship.  Haven't talked to them in years, but if I ever do become closer to my parents again, what value is in these other relationships? They must think so low of me. I'm not a real person. \n\nWhat is it like to have any enduring familial kinship? The concept is so alien. I feel like an orphan to the human race. \n\nI know all about family of choice but really it's not the same. It's going to take a lifetime just to even learn how to attach to someone. Like...technically.  I feel very little faith with deeper friendships, I'll just be cast aside when I become inconvenient. Time has proved that again and again. \n\nWhatever, I'm just a rock drifting in space. No real question or point here. But your perspective or sharing similar feelings/experiences are appreciated. Is there any reading material you've found helpful with being a foreigner to any deep, loving connections or part of any nurturing community? \n\nThanks for reading. ",

Anyway, my husband and I came home from work today and found a note on our apartment door from an anonymous neighbor about our dog who apparently was barking loudly and nonstop. \n\nWe are supposed to see a movie tonight for date night but all I can think about is this note we found taped to the door about our dog barking. I know she can be loud but I had no idea it was that bad. And I guess I don't even know how bad it is, maybe it's really bad or maybe they are overreacting? I just read the note and that feeling of dread stopped my heart. I feel like I can't get off the couch. I don't want to move or do anything. I mean I guess I want to be able to forget this for a while and enjoy my Friday night but I just feel frozen. If this was a few years ago I would probably sit in silence on the couch for hours going over and over this note, not eating until I was practically starving or maybe cry and eventually fall asleep and not be myself again for a few days. Now I at least know that's what's going to happen if I don't reach out for some help. So that's what I'm doing... I don't know if I'm just punishing myself, feeling like I'm a bad pet owner for not knowing what's going on? Like maybe I don't deserve to have a date night because I'm a bad dog mom?\n\nI never used to think I had anxiety because I don't have the kind of panic attacks that people talk about, where they think they are having a heart attack or can't breathe or something. But I get this horrible dread and it's like I just shut down completely. I want to get better... I have such a hard time bouncing back from things like this. I'm scared of the neighbors being mad at us, reporting it to the apartment complex, or calling animal control and getting our dog taken away or something crazy happening. I've always been terrified of noise complaints, especially with all the stuff I've read in the news about police killing the family dog on random calls. They are just outliers but obviously my anxiety riddled brain has a file on it in the back of my mind, reminding me that it could happen, and trying to make a backup plan for it. I feel like I sound crazy. People deal with this stuff all the time and here I am barely able to talk let alone get up and eat something because I have no idea how to fix this problem that I didn't even know was happening.

Lying, breaking property, blaming other kids, peeing everywhere on purpose, defiance, and general rule breaking. Yes some of this is his age and personality. But it's escalated greatly the last week or so. \n\nIf you remember the nanny/day care drama we had two months ago, Im Sure you can imagine that this has taken me right back to that anxiety. I'm so terrified that they're going to kick us out. I also know this is my anxiety talking and not them. They, so far, seem willing to find what works for him. Today he behaved worse and purposefully peed all over the bathroom. His behavior is starting to detract from the other kids. Even last night was constantly in time out and eventually sent to bed with out any thing fun (tv, snuggling, reading etc). \n\nSo today when I found out about the purposeful peeing, I got upset and scared again. While texting with the providers, the one who owns the house was super upset. She said if he can't respect her or the house, it will become an issue. That triggered me into a massive panic attack. I took that as \"Im kicking your kid out if he does this again\" and I can't control my toddler's behavior! I can only encourage and discipline appropriately. I panicked. My anxiety cycled up so badly. \n\nThey continued to work with him and discovered that he may be trying to get himself kicked out so I stay home with him and the baby (we've had A LOT of changes in the last 5-6 months including me going from working afternoon/evenings and spending all day with him to working a 9-5 again). So I think that's part of it. He also is trying to get attention anyway he can because he's not getting the positive attention he needs. We haven't been filling up his love bank. \n\nI implemented a new routine and structure (which is hard for me bc I'm a free spirit but I'm beyond happy to do it bc he needs it) tonight and it worked like a charm. He was calmer. Didn't get in trouble. Followed directions and was even calm while i spoke to my husband when he got home. He didn't try to vie for attention or anything. He continued to draw and color. So I'm hopeful that we'll see a gradual improvement post haste. We even had him \"Write\" an apology letter to them. \n\nMe personally? I'm a wreck. I feel like the most selfish horrible parent. I work with kids. Behavior is my bread and butter and I missed this. It took the day care ladies and the pediatrician I called to point it out. I feel like I've failed him. I haven't been filling his love bank. I've been putting my own needs first in dealing with a new baby and new job. I didn't adjust when I needed to adjust. and I'm so afraid he'll keep escalating and we'll get kicked out of day care. I've already exhausted all the other possibilities last time. And we love this place. I can't let my mind go there...\n\nI just feel like I've failed to start teaching him the things he needs because I've been too lazy to do things like have a daily routine, have dinner at the table instead of at the couch, etc. I've raged against the system so long that I didn't change for my kid and i feel horrible.

He also picked up painters tape which I don't like to use, for many reasons but I like the results better just using an angled brush. I told him, I wouldn't need the tape, and he told me he bought it so he could tape just the caulking beside the sink because he was hoping I'd paint over it. I said ok, and when I went to start painting, he had taped the whole bathroom. I said nothing and proceeded with primer and two coats of paint, and when I removed the tape everything looked bad and I got very upset with him. \n\nI realize I handled it wrong, but have no idea how to handle it right. Should I have removed the tape and proceeded to paint? Asked him to remove it? Told him since he taped he could go ahead and paint also? What would have been the best way to go about this? Thanks all.\n\nEdit: spelling\n\n",

        "text": "Hi,\nMy son told me about this group and suggested I leave a post. I am an abuse survivor and also have AADD. I am in counseling with a wonderful psychologist.  I'm going to try to keep this first post short, but basically I grew up with several Ns: my mother, adoptive father, and brother. I got away from them as an adult after a major blow up with my mother. During an argument about my youngest daughter's grades, she yelled that she hadn't had a life since the day I was born. She also informed me that she was jealous because I had gotten to do what I wanted and she didn't. I decided that day to give her her life back. About six months ago, I had a visit with my cousin and was able to talk to my biological dad's brother. I discovered what had happened. She had told me a long time ago that she had gotten married right out of High School. That wasn't entirely true. She got married four months out of High School and five months before I arrived. So she and my father weren't married when I was conceived. It appears that she took all her hurt and anger over that situation and dumped it on me. I came at a time when she wasn't ready and instead of realizing she only had herself to blame, she dumped it on an innocent baby. Anyway, I have been under treatment for AADD and counseling as an abuse survivor for about a year and a half now. I was also in college until about six months ago and extremely busy trying to get everything done. Now I am out of school and have more time to process everything. I'm experiencing an awful lot of emotions including anger, hurt, self-doubt, feeling like anytime something doesn't go right it's \"my fault\" even though my husband and children try desperately not to encourage me to feel that way. I want to confront her with the date of her marriage and say, \"When were you going to tell me about this? You have the nerve to make me feel like this whole business is my fault when I was just a baby who was the product of you and my father not being able to control yourselves!\" I'm not going to do it because it's just going to end badly if I do. But I'm so angry and hurt right now and I needed a safe place to talk. The little girl in me feels like an orphan! I just need to know this is normal and I'm not alone. Thanks!",

        "text": "Hi all. I recently posted over on RBN about going to therapy with my mother. A quick recap: I went for one session with a very good therapist. It was awful. I was expecting it to be awful, though I had a little kid's hope in there somewhere that she would have changed and would finally 'see' me. I was not afraid of it being awful. I was afraid of it being okay, of her putting on a good show, of the therapist being taken in by her. He was not taken in. \n\nI contacted the therapist afterwards saying that, unless he could give me a compelling reason to continue, I felt it was best to leave it. He replied saying 'I can't say I'm surprised', that he thought this was the best decision from my perspective, that he was impressed by the steps I'd taken towards recovery and that if my mother reached out to him he would help her make sense of my not continuing 'with whatever facilities for sense-making she has available'. He told me I was not the problem. He called me the 'identified patient and carrier of the shadow', which is another way of saying 'narcissist's scapegoat' - the identified patient is the member of a family who is unconsciously made into the 'problem' when they may well be its healthiest member. \n\nI didn't even feel anything for her in the session other than repulsion and annoyance. I didn't want to stay in the room with her. She was delusional to the point of sounding psychotic. While I have recognised what is and is not healthy behaviour and made huge efforts to break the cycle, she has sought refuge in delusion, in lack of insight, in paranoid, manic defences - I do not believe her to be capable of conscious rational thought. That's not me giving her a free pass. Just recognising that she is defending against reality so deeply and frantically that she cannot see things as they are. Individual therapy would not help her (so says the therapist, and I agree given it would just reinforce her world view, and isn't recommended for NPD). I don't know what would. \n\nI believe my mother is a 'quiet N', the neglecting kind. She had a narcissistic mother and met Ndad when she was 17. It is possible that her entire personality has developed as a reaction to these Ns. Again I'm not giving her a free pass (I am way beyond that stage), but recognising that she has never really come into being. \n\nI'm not making excuses for her. I keep saying this because I'm worried people will reply saying I am. I'm far beyond that defensive stage, and into the place where I know she was a terrible, neglectful parent but also have some understanding of her pathology and can hold all of that without needing a black and white choice where either she is to blame or she is ill. \n\nSo there we are. Afterwards, I talked to people about the crazy things she said. I didn't make a silence that I would agonise over breaking - I talked to the people close to me. I told them the delusional things she said. That helped. I told myself it wasn't my fault if she was ill, don't set yourself on fire to keep someone else warm, especially someone who doesn't notice when you are on fire. \n\nAbout two weeks later I crashed emotionally. I felt profoundly abandoned. I got through that, through the sadness and grief. I thought I was okay.\n\nAnd then yesterday panic arrived. That I have made her ill. She was much better than this before I went NC and now it's like she's got much worse. Because of me. I feel like I am a terrible person because I went NC and now she is worse and I made her worse. I thought it proved I was right to go NC. Now I'm worried it means I was wrong. \n\nI have come up with the following arguments against this:\n\n* Maybe she's not worse. Maybe she was only worse then, while I was there threatening her reality, and she's okay when I'm not around.\n\n* Even if she is worse, she made me ill. She neglected me all my life. I went NC after tracking my moods and realising contact with her made me suicidal.\n\n* Even if she is worse, I am not obliged to put up with her and ruin my own sanity.\n\n* If she is indeed worse does that really mean I'm a bad person or simply reveal that she makes me responsible for things that I'm not responsible for? \n\n* My supervisor (who is wonderful - we are new to each other and his first questions when I told him about the therapy appointment were \"so do you actually want to go?\" and \"is this a toxic relationship?\", no \"but it's your MOTHER\" bullshit) suggested that rather than thinking in extremes of what I can tolerate it is helpful to think of reasonableness, a concept from DBT - can this person be reasonable? And the answer is no, she can't.\n\nBut if she is worse because I went NC, does that mean I was wrong? I'm trying to hold off a mental health crisis and would appreciate support. Thanks if you read all this. \n\nUpdate: my supervisor helped me see that maybe she seems worse because I am better; maybe I'm seeing her as she is.\n\nHe also likened her to the wicked witch of the west with a house dropped on her. Did I drop it? No. Can I lift it off? No. So I may as well not lie under it with her.",

        "text": "This is a throwaway account.\n\n**N-Rent Break-up:**\n\nI called to tell my mom I don't want to talk to her for a while -- or ever. My therapist is pretty insistent she already knows based on her behavior recently and she unfortunately got me to realize I'm afraid of retaliation. Anyway, my mother and I started the convo at \"well, what'd I do this time?\" - nmom. I was like nothing and went with \"I won't be coming home for Christmas\" and went no further, because apparently I'm a chicken. She was like \"yeah, I know.\" Goes on with all the superior alternate holiday plans she's made (a caribbean cruise, a solo road trip), and how she's going to do her own thing because our family is such as mess. In short, she broke up with me instead and did a lot of blaming how I have such an interesting life and never want to share anything (mostly because anything I say will be ignored or used against me... also, SINCE WHEN IS ANYTHING I DO INTERESTING TO HER!?!?!), how our family is too dysfunctional and she's just over all of us. She said she'll check in from time to time to see if I'm alive... I'm clearly not out of this, and obviously have no idea how to break up with a parent short of changing my number. And job. And never, ever giving her my home address. I just told her I don't really have anything else to say. And she gave me some more snark and hung up the phone.\n\nShe and I have been LC for about ten years. I'm beginning to find grey-rocking to be mentally draining, It leaves me feeling like something warm was ripped out of me. I feel wrecked that she has no interest in me, and that I have to hide my life from her. \n\nThe edad breakup was easy. I sent a text (since that's the only way he communicates with me and I haven't seen him in almost 5 years) that I don't think he should contact me anymore because it leaves me feeling really hurt and confused with the texts and that after all these years he should know why I'd like to cut ties.\n\n**Therapist:**\n\nI wonder on and off if I should change therapists sometimes. I don't really have a frame of reference, and I don't really know anyone I can ask about seeing a therapist and what I should be expecting out of it. She isn't bad, I'm just wondering if there's better out there. I don't really feel like I set goals, just talk through difficult things I don't really get to in my daily life. Things I'm ashamed to talk about or scared people will reject me over. I'm better with setting boundaries and not seeing everything as a personal attack since going. I also don't get as depressed about having to be firm (not mean) about things at work, but I'm not sure if that's enough. \n\nThere's a cross-racial component. I saw online that this is a common issue between clients and therapists and I'm not sure if it's something I can resolve short of finding someone else. My trauma with my mother isn't necessarily racially specific, but a lot of the abuse and social rejection are very tied to culture and ethnicity. My therapist will never understand why I'm the wrong kind of woman and that anything I achieve is moot within my ethnicity because it goes against everything I'm supposed to be. Also a lot (not all) of my insecurities and feeling of isolation are tied to ethnicity since it's an added barrier between being close to others and finding a place in the world. I can't really take on the role as cultural guide while trying to seek help. That's a huge burden, and an unfair one.\n\n**Other life hurdles:**\n\nMy husband is supportive of me putting space between me and family and being an autonomous adult, but I feel like I'm being a letdown by not dealing with my self-esteem issues in therapy. My mom takes up about 80% of that time. My other family members get 10%. 8% is me feeling like an evil rage b*** imposter at work. That leaves 2% for me to deal with insecurity and not belonging anywhere. I really want my family to take up less of my mental space so I can actually deal with myself, but I feel like I'm taking too long to get to my own issues.  I don't think I can get to me if I can't wrap up this thing with my mom. Part of me feels like few people who actually know me are a little confused why I still talk to her. \n\nThere's also the part of me that feels like my friends will leave me at any moment and I'll be all alone.\n\nAdvice on any of it? Particularly the therapist thing? Life is easy going for the most part, but I definitely constantly question myself if I'm doing the right thing.\n\nSorry this is long.",

Obviously that has to be done within 60 days of the wedding date, so that's not going to happen. He said so it would be like it never happened.\n\nThat's when it hit me.

I sat at a table with some relatives that I felt safe with.  When I saw Nmom and GCNbro enter the room, I didn't feel anything - sad, scared, nothing. It's like they were strangers.  It was a relief to feel safe the whole time.  They even sat at the table behind me facing in my direction (coincidentally, not deliberately) and it didn't bother me at all.  \n\nI have not attended any family parties in the last three years because I did not want to see them, and I did not want to have to explain to people why I wasn't interacting with them.

        "text": "Background: I moved away from NDad when I was pregnant with my little girl. He sexually abused me when I was 4 or 5, and emotionally abused me until I moved out. I hate him so much. I got married in April and didn't include his name on my marriage certificate. His family stopped speaking ~~read harassing~~ me after we got married because we didn't invite them and they apparently didn't know why I've cut them from my life. There's loads more, feel free to read my posts about it which are still on here.\n\nAnyway, my daughter is now nearly 16m. She's started nursery (daycare) recently. It's a fantastic place and she's thriving being there. My dad was a racist, homophobic, sexist idiot (not what I want to say but you get my point) and it was the one thing I promised my daughter would not grow up around. I'm the most accepting person ever, if you respect me, I'll respect you regardless of your skin colour, religion or sexuality. Some of my best friends are bi sexual or lesbian, and my husband happily works with people who have different skin colours (we're white British and my dad thought England should be English - not even Welsh/Scottish/Irish just English ~~racism at it's finest~~)\n\nThere is an adorable little girl at my daughters nursery, who's parents/she is easten asian (we're not sure exactly where as we don't know the parents/haven't asked). Of course I'm absolutely delighted my little girl enjoys playing with her and there's some adorable photos on the online journal of the girls playing together. And I know my NDad would hate it and would insist that we ask the nursery to not let them play together. Of course I'm not a racist, and neither is my husband, so she can continue to play with whoever she wants ~~plus I think Nursery would be well within their rights to ask us to take our daughter elsewhere if we did ask~~\n\nAnd when these things happen, I win slightly more everyday. My life away from NDad is free.\n\nI still get the odd message/question from my ndad via my brother but it's nowhere near as bad as it was when I'd regularly be harassed while doing my shopping, be reported to social services for leaving my daughter with her grandparents (husbands parents live Next Door But One to NDads Parents) or sent vile messages about how selfish I was.\n\nI'm winning, slowly but surely I'm winning. And my daughter will never grow up thinking she's wrong for having a friend with a different coloured skin, a different religion or a different sexuality to herself or us!",

I looked out the window into the dark sky as my narcissistic mother went on about how much she hates taking me to my fathers house as we drove down the interstate.\n\n\"I WILL NEVER BE HAPPY ABOUT TAKING YOU TO YOUR FATHERS HOUSE,\" she yelled.\n\nI knew this would be the last time I would be in her presence. I was scared, I was nervous, I was excited.\n\nThe text messages began to start after a few days:\n\n\"When are you coming back?:) :) :)\"\n\n\"I love you so much sweet one and so does Jesus.\"\n\n\"I miss you so much!! :) :)\"\n\nI didn't respond.\n\nI entered therapy and joined a mens group to talk about my past.\n\n It hurt to come to realize you had a parent who didn't care about you. Who only saw you as a source of narcissistic supply like how a vampire sees blood.\n\nShe tried to find out the name of my therapist. She sent me meaningless gifts and cards. She tried to get my other siblings to talk to me. I held my ground.\n\nAnd soon enough... she stopped messaging me.\n\nAs painful as it was to divorce the contact with my mother it has been one of the greatest decisions I have ever made. I began to see how conditional our relationship was. I started to feel empowered.\n\nThe pain will never go away. You must feel it, accept it, and move through life with it. It makes you stronger. It makes you appreciate the quality relationships you do have. It makes all the petty difficulties of life seem trivial.\n\nI have learned more than anything to never ever tolerate anyone who treats you poorly. I don't care if its your dad, your mom, your siblings, your coach, your neighbor, the fucking pope (amen).\n\nBy drawing the line in the sand you are saying, no more secrecy, no more gaslighting, no more guilting, no more triangulation, no more lying, no more manipulation, no more abuse.\n\nAs Alfred from The Dark Knight says, \"Some people just want to watch the world burn.\" My advice: run from those people.\n\nDon't let anyone treat you badly.

If I see her any more often, she gets too comfortable and close to me and goes back to her old ways. But our current setup is good, when I do see her we are distant enough that we are friendly and have a nice time (strange, with normal people it's the opposite!) I definitely have a lot of resentment towards her, she was very mentally sometimes physically abusive, and I've finally began to mourn the mother I never had and the mother-daughter relationship I never will have. I have a lot of her tendencies that I've picked up and worked hard (and am still working hard) to lose. \n\nWe talked recently last week, and now she's been pressuring me to go to an event in town with her. I DONT want to go, I wouldn't go on my own bc it's loud and awful there, and I really don't want to spend time with her. I feel bad saying no, and I mentioned to my fiancé that I was going out but didn't really want to. \n\nHe kind of pushed me to tell him about the situation, why would I go do something if I didn't want to? So I explained to him what was going on. And he got *mad.* and my fiancé doesn't get mad, he's a relatively calm, stoic man. He told me (I'm paraphrasing here) \"Fuck her, you don't owe her a damn thing. She's nothing to you. I only see my parents on holidays and you have a whole hell of a lot more reason to avoid her. You have your own family now, your own home, you're a grown woman, you don't have to do anything she tells you to. She can't do anything to you anymore. She's the reason you feel this way, and go if you want but if you're just going because you feel obligated to, DONT GO.\" \n\nI am so glad I have him to put his foot down and talk sense into me and remind me how toxic she is. 😬 If it weren't for him, I would have ended up going, done Jell-O shots with my freakin mom and her friends, then she'd think we were friends again or something, start inviting me over, and I'd get sucked into her crap again. Even just being with her for the day her behaviors either rub off on me or remind me of my past trauma. Shit if it weren't for him I'd still be living with her and putting up with her abuse. I'm so grateful for him supporting me and pushing me when I need to be pushed, and I'm so happy I have a REAL family now , even if it's tiny, who loves and supports me, and makes me feel safe and happy ❤️",

        "text": "Infantilization: treat (someone) as a child or in a way that denies their maturity in age or experience.\n\nInfantilization is the opposite of Parentification.\n\nI was Infantilized by my Narcissistic Mother.\n\nExamples:\n\nConstantly talking to me in a sing-song-voice.\n\nConstantly referring to a time when I was younger. The \"Good old days.\"\n\nNot letting me get a drivers license until I was 18 only because I demanded it before moving to NYC.\n\nNot encouraging me/allowing me to date anyone in high school\n\nAlways getting me age inappropriate toys for christmas that I used to get as a child.\n\nNever letting me do any chores and then guilting me for not helping her out. (ex. cooking, laundry, cleaning, learning about bills, insurance, etc.)\n\nShaming any form of sexuality in me while at the same time saying that girls are checking me out.\n\nTreating me like a prized dependent pony\n\nGuilting me when I got angry for not being a good lil boy like a I used to be when I was little.\n\nOne particular memory is when I was about 14 years old. I was sick and a bit disoriented. I was falling asleep and my Nmom put a teddy bear under my arm as I slept. I hated that fucking bear.\n\nCooking me childhood dishes like grilled cheese and Mac and Cheese or anything with cheese.\n\nReferring to times when I was scared/alone and she was there to save me.\n\nYou get the picture.\n\nOn the surface it doesn't SEEM that abusive but it is incredibly insidious. Basically, you are being emotionally regressed and not allowed to develop any sense of self efficacy. This results in low self esteem and a constant drive to prove yourself to others.\n\nI went through a rough period in my late teens and early twenties where I was incessantly trying to prove my masculinity to other men by trying to have rampant casual sex with girls while at the same time having low self esteem. I have nothing against casual sex (trust me) but I was coming at it from such a validation and attention seeking place that it became toxic. I felt like shit.\n\nI still didn't know how to do my laundry. I still didn't shower every day. I still didn't change my underwear and socks every day. I didn't clean. My apartment was always a mess. It was embarrassing.\n\nWhen I became aware of WHY I was behaving the way I was behaving is when things began to change. I realized it wasn't my fault. I was never allowed to develop a sense of genuine accomplishment and as a result I looked for the approval outside my self.\n\nOver the last few months I have made it my goal in life to wear clean underwear and clothes (Yes, seriously). I do the dishes as if I am trying to be employee of the month. I get as giddy as a little school girl at the thought of doing my laundry. Don't even get me started on driving a car. Pure Bliss.\n\nFor people who have been infantilized, the smallest and most mundane tasks take on great meaning. For every thing you do to gain self efficacy is gaining a piece of your true identity and autonomy back. You feel like Neo in the matrix realizing what you are truly capable of.\n\nMost people will roll their eyes, complain, and begrudgingly take the trash out. You will cherish every time you pull your car out of the driveway, hear the beep from the laundry machine, or cook yourself a meal. Because you know with every little task you do you will be getting your life back. You will experience power where others do not.\n\nI would love to hear other stories from people who have been infantilized.\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I have some clothes to fold.",

In particular, when my partner \"withdraws\" I feel it as rejection when it is not. As an ACON when a partner withdraws I bring out all my armor and a better reaction, account to my therapist, would be to draw the withdrawler closer to me instead. ",

        "text": "My grandma. The most gentle, sweet force of maternal unshaken strength. The strong woman who had mental health problems. She took medication to numb the world for her when her episodes proved too intense. I tend to think of her as enlightened rather than ill. A pure artists soul, she painted, played piano, maintained her garden of flowers and veggies. She loved WW2 era big-band music, my heart sings to her and I have to fight back tears when I hear that old music. \n\nMy Nmom blamed her for every hateful instinct in her life, and because I was young and trusted my mother, regretfully I did too. \n\nI remember my grandma in so many ways. I remember her sensitivity. She would always say 'Be sweet to each other.' I remember her smile, and her hugs. Her hands were always so warm and caring. She was unearthly sweet to my mother, and I believe that was genuine, not a life-long act like my mother chose to believe. \n\nMy memories are few and far between, so there are things I don't recall. I don't recall my mother ever being kind to my grandma. But I have endless memories of my grandmother's kindness to everyone.\n\nI remember my grandma during her panic attacks. This sweet old lady would walk through our house, and just cry. She would just weep inconsolably for hours at a time. I was a child through all this, and though I know it's not my fault, I still feel so haunted by my mother's treatment of her during these times.\n\nMy Nmom would yell at her to 'Shut up, just shut up\" and proceed to ignore her until her crying got loud again again. In which case my mother would yell at her again and again. No one tried to comfort her. No one would try to make her feel better. My sweet grandma had panic attacks and it was written off as 'crazy' and inconvenient. I don't recall a single compassionate act to help her during these terrible moments.\n\nI was just a kid, so that is how I was brought up to treat my grandmother.\n\nI didn't realize that I was ACON until my grandma was diagnosed with cancer a few years ago. She passed not long after and I'll never be able to hear her play piano again. I'll never be able to share my own love of painting with her.\n\nI didn't realize until after she died just how many lies and manipulations I had been spoon fed by my Nmom about her. My basis of understanding came crashing down around me and I had to rebuild my mental foundation brick by brick. (As many of us are dealing with!)\n\nMy grandma was the only maternal force I had growing up. Without her, I wouldn't have known how kind people could be to one another. And I never got to tell her any of this. She'll never know how sad I feel that my family treated her like a burden instead of the beautiful gift she was.\n\nI'm trying to forgive myself, though I know I was just a child trusting my parents. I wish she was here with me right now. I could use one of her hugs.\n\nI'm just feeling sad today, I guess. Thanks for reading.",

I took a futon mattress and some other things. I left many belongings in the room there at their house. There was no lock on the bedroom door. For probably a month up until this I would answer a question from my mother with \"I don't want to talk about it right now\" or something else that wouldn't disclose information. And she would keep asking, I think.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI left. They let me borrow the car to move but said I had to give them my address to continue using it, \"in case something happens\", and that they wouldn't surprise me with a visit. I refused to do that so I didn't use the car after that. I moved from the Philadelphia suburbs into South Philly. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nPeriodically my mom would send me a text but overall there wasn't a huge effort. My grandmother was dying and she kept texting me to try to get me to see her. I eventually did.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe roommates I chose in South Philly were not a good fit for me and I bounced around a couple places trying to find something that worked, then ended up in the hospital with a stomach problem caused by stress. I'd also gotten a full-time social work job during this time. I asked to stay at my parents' house after being in the hospital and they said I could. I was finding the city really stressful due to the noise and busyness and wanted somewhere quieter. My mom and I started going to family therapy.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIn family therapy the therapist identified I don't seem to have much respect for my mom, which I was sort of aware of. He also identified my mom was \"pursuing\" me-- asking me questions and I wouldn't give an answer and she would continue pursuing or trying to get information or an answer. I'd set some boundaries with my mom and they weren't being respected. The therapist suggested my parents treat me like a boarder, since I am 24 and it is time in my life for me to not be dependent on my parents. I wanted to be treated like a child and to finally be parented. I went home during this time to \"check the facts\" and find out if my parents really are loving or can be parents to me.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nDespite my desire to be parented I went along with what the therapist said, but my mom did not. My parents did eventually create a list of rules for me to follow while I'm living in the house. It was out of anger and they didn't enforce them. I soon decided I'd move out. My mother repeatedly showed an unwillingness to set boundaries and to do things that would allow her to get respect. She chose to basically continue doing the same things rather than change.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI wished my parents would get a divorce because my dad screams at my mom and my mom pushes him to do so, then laughs and makes it so that the situation looks like he's crazy (because she's calm and smiling and he's damn near screaming) when really she's been subtly pushing him the whole time. She has done this to me also. She has also taken many jabs at my mental health. She had promised me the car and wavered on that promise at one point. She got angry at me for asking her directly for a date to go switch the title to my name, saying I was \"trying to pin her down\". I was just trying to get a definite date to actually go from a person who refuses to exercise responsibility and accountability (see: not having a healthy relationship with my father or me, putting up with abuse and mistreatment and not making an effort to change those relationships or leave them), since if we never actually go I'll never actually have the title in my name. She got mad at me and I said, \"This is not a mature way to handle this, this is not a responsible way to handle this, and I'm not okay with this.\" She said, \"I'm sorry. I'm sorry you're not okay.\" &lt;--------TWIST WORDS MUCH??!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI've since left and have not returned a text from her. I got some things out of the house and left as she asked if we could talk. She followed me outside and I drove away as she knocked on the car window. She has not acknowledged this. I put a lock on my bedroom door and she recently texted me that she'll turn over the title to me, which she now has over a month from the date she said she would have it, if I unlock the bedroom door.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThere are more examples of things that were unhealthy, but did I do enough? Did I cover my bases? Did I make a real effort to make it work out?",

        "text": "Hi LAN. I wanted to share what felt like significant 'recovery moments' with you. It's tempting to say \"this is silly but...\" (thanks, inner critic) but it's not silly to me. \n\nOne of my longest-lasting ACoN manifestos (as it were) is that it's not okay for me to bother others with my feelings, they don't matter as much as other people's feelings and I'll harm others by expressing them. Which stems from being ignored or abandoned when I was upset and being blamed for Ndad's apparent suicidal feelings. \n\nIt has taken me such a long time to unpick this. At times I still catch myself acting and reacting as if it's true. I still have emotional flashbacks where I imagine that other people think it's ridiculous and selfish of me to show my feelings. I've got much, much better at recognising those for what they are and sense-checking them, but it's still a work in progress. I have been known to ring the Samaritans and apologise for bothering them. \n\nRather than going from one extreme to the other (just as it is untrue that my emotional pain will always harm others, it is also untrue that it never will) I am forever searching for the middle ground, ie to accept that I *may* distress or annoy others with my emotions but that doesn’t mean I must never express them or am not entitled to have them.\n\nOn Friday something distressing upset me at work. (I work for a mental health charity.) I was asked if I was okay or needed someone else to take over. I opened my mouth to say I was fine. Then I stopped and checked in with myself properly about how I actually felt and gave the real answer, which was no, I wasn't fine. (I was then so well cared for and supported that I felt completely overwhelmed and uncomfortable, as I'm still getting used to being treated like I matter.) \n\nSecondly, I was in a cafe with a friend on Saturday. She has just started introductory training in counselling or I might have handled this situation differently. I was talking about something emotional and she picked up the serviette dispenser and put it right in front of me. I said: please don't do that, it feels like you are telling me to stop being upset. She said wow, she never thought of it like that, she would always hand a friend a tissue if they are crying. I said different people see it in different ways and you'll be thinking about this in your training and that's why I mentioned it. \n\nAfterwards I realised I hadn't apologised for being upset. Or asked for reassurance that it was okay that I was upset (maybe it wasn't okay for her). I had simply acted like I was allowed to be upset. I feel a bit panicked thinking about that, and again I know that's not because it's true, but because it compromises what I learned growing up. I panic because someone (me!) is disagreeing with my internalised parents. And I panic because, if I am allowed to be upset, if it matters as much when I am upset as when others are upset, then I was robbed and I was wronged and that is terribly hurtful and traumatic. But the panic is transient and I can wait it out. \n\nNor did I apologise to my friend for 'making' her feel bad, for telling her not to do something. I didn't panic in the moment. I just plainly and simply said why it was an issue without taking responsibility for her feelings as well. And I just wanted to share that. ",

        "text": "Posting this here, because I don't know many places to post it where its meaning will actually be understood.\n\n[The Devil.](http://i.imgur.com/IPvzD3z.jpg)\n\nThe picture (and following poem) describes me attempting to slay the dragon of my past -- a friendship that lasted 10 years, and only recently in the past year, with the help of my spouse, come to realize and accept that the entire time I had known her she had heavily emotionally and mentally manipulated and abused me.\n\nAfter realizing, I approached her to speak about it, an attempt for a level one on one \"hey, you hurt me the entire time we've known each other, and I think we should split up.\" talk. But it was quickly turned around, about how she was the victim, about how I suddenly owed her money (15$... i don't know from where), and she immediately went to publically groan about how I owed her money. But never did she really show any remorse of how she treated me, despite being someone who is aggressively against 'abuse' and 'abuse enablers'.\n\nIt became clear to me that 15$ I owed her was worth more than the 10 solid years I had spent being one of her best friends.\n\nI can't stop thinking about her, and that final conversation. In 15 minutes I basically reached the conclusion that our entire 10 years of facing the world together meant absolutely fucking NOTHING. It haunts me daily. Sometimes I cry, wishing I could go back and tell her how I actually felt. But my spouse reminds me that she is incapable of internalizing criticism -- as narcs tend to be.\n\nThe conversation happened over a year ago, and yet it is still on my mind daily.\n\nShe was more than a friend, she was someone I considered a sibling throughout my teenage years. I don't really understand how I was so blind to how little I was worth to her. \n\nShe enjoyed the symbolism of christian mythos, and would playfully call herself Satan (that being her nickname for years), and was obsessed with the occult. In recent, after what had happened, the only way I could get any form of closure was seeing myself as an angel. I've gravitated to the aesthetic and concept and I collect angel themed things these days as a sort of reclaiming my sense of self from someone who didn't see the irony of thinking herself as the devil. \n\nShe also really loved sheep, thus the sheep theme.\n\nAnyway, my poem:\n\n&gt; My moma always told me the Devil would come.\n&gt; \"She'll be as sweet to you as a ripe plum.\"\n&gt; \n&gt; My momma always told me the Devil would call.\n&gt; \"She'll always be the one you least expect of all.\"\n&gt; \n&gt; Momma always told me she wore the wool of a sheep.\n&gt; But she never did tell me how long she would creep.\n&gt; \n&gt; I always figured I'd be smart enough to tell,\n&gt; where the Devil would hide and where the Devil would dwell.\n&gt; \n&gt; I never expected the Devil to be a weed.\n&gt; Waiting in the shadows until we formed a deed.\n&gt; \n&gt; For a decade I walked by her side, as loyal as a dog.\n&gt; Bound to her by faith that she would clear the fog.\n&gt; \n&gt; She never did treat me well.\n&gt; But I was too intoxicated to tell.\n&gt; \n&gt; I never would growl, I never would bite.\n&gt; When she kicked me I didn't put up a fight.\n&gt; \n&gt; Then, eventually, she tired of me.\n&gt; She discarded me without much of a plea.\n&gt; \n&gt; Now I lay here, head heavy with grief.\n&gt; Wondering how I could have been loyal to such a thief.\n&gt; \n&gt; The Devil, she is a dragon amongst sheep.\n&gt; I see her every night as I toss in my sleep.\n&gt; \n&gt; Haunting me every moment with the lies of our past.\n&gt; I cry out, \"please let this be our last!\"\n&gt; \n&gt; The Devil throws you a cold shoulder, while whispering in your ears.\n&gt; Of everything that she had ever said during those long years.\n&gt; \n&gt; \"Let me rest,\" I cry. \"Let me have peace!\"\n&gt; But all my memories allow me are the softness of her fleece.\n&gt; \n&gt; One day I will pick up a sword and lop off her head.\n&gt; To prove that even the Devil could be bled.\n&gt; \n&gt; But until then, I tolerate the whispering dark.\n&gt; The shadow of the Devil, the shadow of a Narc.",

I found a ton of information using one of the genealogy websites. What was interesting is that it is so different than what I had been told. Much of what I was told was told to me by the Nm and after my dad died. \n\nShe had told me that my dad's mother was an Irish orphan so there were no records at all on the grandmother's family tree. Not only did I find out this was completely untrue. Her birth family lived in the same city as the Nm did and were well known. There was no way that could be a mistake. \n\nI also found a bunch of information on my dad's siblings I hadn't been informed of or the Nm made sure I didn't know. None of it was really bad. Just some multiple marriages and spouses/kids I never knew about. But the Nm disapproved of this so she erased it from what I was allowed to know. The subject of these family members always pissed her off and she would abruptly change the subject no matter who was talking about them.\n\nI was able to trace both sides of my dad's family back to Europe in the 1700's with minimal effort.  Nobody was an orphan and there is detailed records. \n\nThe things an N will shit all over sometimes is just quite amusing. I am glad I did dig into this. The \"good\" side of my history means more now and I have an idea who they were. ",

Nothing has happened today *yet*.\n\nI think about them less. I spend more time thinking about my dog. Last week my new husband and I moved up to a mountain home. It's right by a trail. Technically we live at the base of the mountain, but this is where all the weather changes anyway, so it's practically the same thing. \n\nI miss my N's dog. I stopped looking at their local shelter to make sure I could snag him if they gave him up. (They purchased a second dog because N thought that the dog was displaying too much affection to people other than her, and she hated that. So she bought a dog that was all hers. Nutcase.) I have my own dog now who is an absolute delight. A bouncy, extremely protective, playful, snuggly Jack Russel/Chi mix. He fears NOTHING!* \n\n*shopping carts, cats, and blue collar workers excluded. No refunds.\n\nI quit working due to fear (my NGma shops at my store a lot. I wanted to cut off from that.) but my boss facilitated that as much as possible. That store's crew has completely fallen apart. None of the same people work there.  I now work as a housewife. Despite years of being my N's slave, I actually enjoy keeping a clean house and having the time and freedom to look after my home, husband, and dog, instead of being a (literal) wage slave like I was before. My N took so much money from me, and worked me so hard, that I actually could probably be classified as a legit slave. She was being \"gracious\" if she let me have a free day once a month. And even those weren't free, they were just filled less with work. \n\nI haven't had a paranoid episode in over a year now. There have been a few bad days, but none of them have been full-blown paranoia/psychosis, so that's nice. I still have bad anxiety attacks, especially if I read a familiar phrase on RBN/LAN. I'm also in therapy now, so even the things that do bother me are a click away.\n\nUnfortunately, my experience was incredibly lucky. Much of my N's plan of control hinged on the fact that my now-husband didn't love me. Psych! He does love me, a lot. I read all the time of escape attempts gone horribly wrong and I am forever thankful that, despite how much stuff got stolen, nearly all of it was replaceable. My N's didn't try to contact me (except my NGma, which was basically just \"have X stop mailing stuff/calling me\", which I've now blocked her number.) \n\nThere are really deep, dark days. Days RIDDLED with emotional and mental flashbacks. Just yesterday I made a mistake and I defaulted to running to my room in tears. It wasn't even that big of a mistake. By no means would I call myself \"healthy\", but I would call myself \"healthier\". \n\nI guess if you're on this subreddit, you're LAN. But if you're not, life does get better with NC and escaping. You see it almost every day on here. To anybody out there who's Exodus Day is today, good luck, and may the graces of whatever God you believe in be entirely with you. My heart aches for you. ",

Yeah, the nightmares are the worst part.\n\nI wake up from these, and go back to life, where my family is angry at me, my father is in prison for unspeakable crimes to his own flesh and blood children, and everything I used to believe has turned to dust blown away on the wind.\n\nI have my sources of happiness. I have a beautiful girlfriend who loves me very much. I have a few close friends I can rely on. I have no one to take care of but myself. It's a pretty easy life. Which is good; easy is all I can handle right now. I'm 32 and trying to heal from wounds that no doctor can treat.\n\nSlowly, the wounds have closed up. They ache, but they no longer bleed. They didn't take the infection of narcissism, bitterness, or nihilism. The nightmares have become less terrifying than they once were. I prayed again for the first time recently and have once again been able to think about a higher being that may have some good in mind for us poor creatures on Earth.\n\nEvery day is pain. ",

        "text": "I live out of state alone and have a plethora of problems that consume me daily. \n\n\nA few months back my parents kind of informed me that they would be over for a visit. I struggle greatly with loneliness and the thought of having a loving family around was exciting. \n\nI ask them to stay for a week, in my home. It's the first time I've had my own home and I didn't understand what a huge mistake it was to give up my safe spot. But I really do love my family and I was only concerned with their comfort and that we would have the maximum amount if time to be with each other. \n\n\nThe trip is fun until, or course, too much alcohol is introduced to narcissism. A night of screaming and emotional blackmail ensues with my mother trying to demand I stay and do whatever she wants. I tell her it's not going to happen in my house and I leave. I come back the next morning because I just want this visit so badly. I'm no stranger to mistakes, so I have a lot of forgiveness in my heart for a lot of people. \n\n\nMom apologizes (which she never does!) and we act like nothing happened and have more fun. Then the last day my Mom and I start butting heads again, no alcohol, just narcissism and it turns into emotional blackmail again, my mother demanding I do things and that she needs to be respected at all costs. I put my foot down, as an adult and lay some ground rules. I say when she is calm she can call me and we'll start to fix this mess. She wants the upper hand so they end up packing up and leaving without saying goodbye. \n\n\nI'm relieved and heartbroken at the same time. But mostly relieved and I feel like I get on with my life quickly. Then the depression and loneliness sets in. I feel like I'm in a frantic free-fall with nothing to grab on to. I'm bad at making friends and I don't trust anyone. It's such a struggle to let people in. The only thing I keep thinking is that if I don't even have a family how will I ground myself with a support system? There's literally no one I feel comfortable talking to and I start to self destruct as I always do. I'm grasping at anything to help carry my burden, but there's nothing there.\n\n\nAs usual, after time, my Mom slowly trickles back into my life, acting as if nothing happened. She really truly does love me and **want** to do what's best, but she just has so many unaddressed problems. This is the hope. I see the want, on both ends, to have each other in our lives. But my therapist pointed out that the relationship I want with my mother may never happen. This was incredibly hard on me and accepting it jump-started my depression. \n\n\nI see it. I see all the hope I have for a loving, nurturing, stable relationship that's unshakable with my family. It's where all the forgiveness comes from. I turned 30 and my Mom asked if we could Skype. I agreed but when the time came, a sickening anxiety crept into me and I blew it off. On the upside I was able to say I just wasn't feeling like it, instead of just burying my head and ignoring texts. And i know deep down she knows the reason why. \n\n\nThis is hard for me. I've always forgiven my family, and they've always hurt me, but also always come back to me. It's so hard to turn my back on hope, but whenever I think of interacting with my Mom this darkness envelopes me. It's an ugly relationship. I don't feel good. I don't like what she did and I don't like that she never acknowledged or apologized for it. \n\n\nI just wanted to share in case anyone else is having this back and forth conflicting relationship as well. I've done it my whole life and I only recently worked out that it is because I want so badly for a stable, loving relationship with my mother. And I am only now accepting that I may never get it, and it absolutely **kills** me. I also accept that the pain is natural and understandable and expected. The bond between a mother and daughter is an important one and a difficult one to give up.",

I began reading about this disorder two months ago when my ex (who is a narc) was upset i wasn't getting over the fact that he cheated on me while I was pregnant and my sister had just died, a lot I know but anyway i wasn't getting over it fast enough so he threatened me with a felony.  Actually,  the Police threatened me for him because he was acting like he had never done it! I filled domestic violence charges on him and just had my first hearing today.  It was nerve wracking!! I was in need of emotional support and unfortunately talked to my mother because even though I avoided specifics,  when it came down to her turn to reply to me about how creepy the prosecutor said my N was, she completely ignored everything I had said and reiterated that my daughter looked cute playing on the floor. (?) I don't get it,  like I'm going through aDV case you would think a parent would be supportive (it's my first dv case fyi) I'm also moving to a new house which is a step up from the old double I am renting... and yesterday she told me she had went out of her way to drive by it (I never gave her the address verbally or written,  she saw what it was when I showed her the mapquest pic) and that it was the only house in the subdivision without a tree in the front yard. -  really pissed me off but I didn't show it.  And honestly I think it was all because I was excited about the central air conditioning and they don't have that in their house. \n",

Best decision ever. However, it was a passive NC, as in I never told them I was done, just ghosted. It took them until now to reach out to me. \n\n\nMy father, who other than being an EDad, isn't too bad now, texted me yesterday to let me know he'll be in town the end of the month and wants dinner with me and my husband. He lives 3000 miles away, so this doesn't happen often. First he texted my husband, then Hubs reminded my father he needed to ask me. (Strike 1) Though my father was quite violent in my childhood, the last twenty years have been good, other than the egregious enabling of my mother's disordered behavior. As long as I don't need him to be supportive, we've had an on and off relationship over the last few decades. I'd love to maintain loose ties with him. But I struggle to reconcile the father who patiently taught me to change a tire with the one who held my hands under boiling tap water to toughen me up while I struggled to escape. Common sense says to never talk to him again. \n\n\nIf he's bringing my mother this isn't happening; not a chance. But if it's just him, I'm torn between explaining why I want to stay NC or extremely VLC, or just declining the invite. I don't feel guilty, but honestly wondering if I can talk with him about my decision like two adults and get some closure. \n\n\nSo advice time. Do I:\nDecline the invite and if asked, email my reasons for NC, risking this info getting passed around?\n\nAttend dinner, be a greyrock-star and leave quickly?\n\nAttend dinner, bring out my reasons, set my boundaries, being prepared to walk at any point there is invalidation?\n\nSomething else?\n\n\nI plan to discuss with my therapist this week before I give my father my answer. I'm looking to start some discussion about ideas to decide how to handle, and if I'm letting obligation color my response. ",

        "text": "Hi all,\n\nSoNM here, been NC for 3 years. Recovery has been slow, but I am making decent progress.\n\nAt the start of this month, I moved into a new flat. I am at my most relaxed when I have my own space, and I didn't get on too well with my last flatmate, so it was time to move on. A friend of mine was moving out of her apartment, so I was able to take her room for an initial period of 6 months, with the possibility of an open-ended contract.\n\nIn the last week, it has emerged that my landlady is a textbook narcissist. Some examples:\n\n* Her language is full of guilt-tripping, drama, catastrophising and subtle blaming that I recognise from my Nmum.\n* We had a misunderstanding over whether I was allowed to sleep in her bed or not. My gf was there when she said that I could, and this is also what I remember, but my landlady claims otherwise. Her reaction to when I subsequently slept in her bed was solely to blame, guilt-trip and frankly verbally abuse me for 30 minutes. When asked 3 times whether she saw any responsibility for our miscommunication as lying with her, she responded with narcissistic rage.\n* If you ask her to do anything for you that is a small inconvenience to her (eg in my country she has to register me with the local authorities), she responds with narcissistic rage. Amusingly, she then criticised me for the tone I was using with her.\n* She is very, very concerned not to bother the neighbours. In a normal person, this might appear slightly paranoid or neurotic. In the context of the rest of her personality, I see it as image protection. Some examples: she told me to be quiet when I was moving the furniture in (realistic?), as it was a Sunday and the neighbours were resting. She told me to buy insulation for under the washing machine to stop it making a noise for the neighbours. The washing machine is very quiet and I have had no complaints from the neighbours. In fact, the neighbours have themselves played loud music that disturbed me, but were reasonable about turning the volume down when I complained. \n* She came round a few days ago and was very angry about \"how untidy I had left the flat.\" Granted, there were a few plates I hadn't washed up, but most of the dirt was on her furniture/window-sill from the time that she lived here. Classic projection.\n* One of the thing she also ranted about then was how \"the postbox was overflowing.\" Seriously? There were like 3 newspapers in it which I hadn't got round to opening. And talk about creating drama from nothing.\n\nOver the last few days, I've been very stressed about this. Recognising that she is an N and will complain/ cause drama whatever I do has helped a lot. I'm still worried that she won't inform the authorities that I've moved in, which would make me liable for a fine, but other than that I don't need her anymore. I believe that she has to by law inform the company that owns the flat that she has a subtenant, which she will do as it's in her own interests. I can then ask the company to register me with the authorities if it comes to it.\n\nI have taken pictures of the furniture to maximise my chances of recovering the deposit when I move out. I am anticipating drama then and want to protect myself as much as possible. \n\nShe has already cancelled my contract for once the 6 months are up, so I'm not going to be around her for much longer. My plan from here is to communicate as little as possible, and only in writing. I will be a grey stone and leave her alone to aggress against other people. \n\n",

They'll have excuses to hoover me, pets going with me, ones staying with them, asking where paperwork is, etc.  They still hoover people they broke up with decades ago, and I don't want to be another victim.  They keep talking about how we will be friends forever, bringing me flowers and wine, asking me to take trips with them, and spinning the version of the story into us \"just not working out\"\n\nMy ex and I are also both in a very large social group focused around social events of all sizes.  I blocked them on Facebook and will have no idea when I might run into them.  They're now suddenly everywhere and charming their way through ALL the people now that we've broken up, networking and dating like crazy.  Everybody thinks they are charming and funny, and even I am having trouble holding onto not thinking of them as a nice but broken person after years of lies. \n\nI've slowly been meeting people through the group for several years and staying in it is vital for me. I'm nervous there are going to be ramifications to me not supporting the \"we just didn't work out but we still love each other!!!\" story.  We lived together for a year after our breakup and it was months later a counselor brought up narcissism and I started realizing it wasn't just innocent mistakes and forgotten agreements, but a disorder that with totally different motivations that started making things finally make sense to me.  I'm embarrassed I told that story to myself and others that we were going to live together and be friends for months while I learned more and the pieces fell into place.\n\nI'm struggling to figure out how to ask them for No Contact since I cant HAVE it.  I'm worried how it will come across socially  if I seem rude when we run into each other, and frankly I'm afraid to not be nice to them in person or in print.\n\nI don't plan on mentioning his hurtful behaviors or anything emotional. I plan on making it short and clear about what I don't want (to be friends, to be contacted except for emergencies, to be approached in public and to keep interactions to a short greeting if a social situation calls for politeness, etc.)\n\nIf anybody has any tips for handling this situation I'd love them.

This time like 7 or 8 years ago, I went to California with my flea ridden e-mother for a wedding. It was just the two of us and it was a great trip. We always had so much fun together that I often overlooked the subtle barbs about my weight, my relationship, etc.  But this trip was kinda different. I don't really remember any barbs bc but his trip was about my mother and reconnecting with the group who last made her feel accepted- her college friends. So she was nervous and on her best behavior. It was also a trip down memory lane for her because we used to live in that area when I was a baby. It was a really, overall memorable trip. \n\nSo I woke up this morning to a cool, chilly morning. I slept with the windows open all night (which we really only get a few weeks to do each year bc of where I live-it's either suffocatingly hot and humid or gray, cold and dreary). So the fresh air always sparks wander lust in me. I looked at my \"on this day\" memories and there were tons of pictures from that trip-ones that still had my mother in them that I must of missed on my \"delete my family out of my life\" binge a year or two ago. So not only did the pictures evoke my wanderlust (Im just dreaming of California air right now), but they made me sad too. \n\nI tried to not look at her face because it made it worse. I tried to just be methodical in my deletion picture after picture. But I couldn't help but notice her joy, her acceptance with her old friends, and the peace it brought her. I couldn't help but notice the fun and joy we had. While I don't regret going NC, these pictures do make me a bit sad. \n\nMaybe I'll go on an adventure today just to counteract it",

        "text": "To give context, I am the second to eldest of 6 from a rural midwest town. I currently reside in northern California and I am NC with my FOO. \n\nOk, here it goes:\n\nMy biological father and older sister passed away from a car accident when I was four and a half. This devastated my whole family, and to my understanding, behaviorally changed my mother the most. My mother met my step-dad-to-be when I was five. He had a daughter, but because of strange custody terms, we rarely saw her until I was 17. He was and is a huge enabler, but he also possess a lot of very scary abusive traits. When I was eight they had their first child together (the golden child). They had their next two children when I was 13 and 15.\n\nFrom k-4th I was constantly truant from school (to the point of missing 1 out of 3 days in k and 2nd). My truancy was usually related to my mom just not feeling like taking me to school or because of my \"physical health.\" Halfway through 4th grade, I was pulled out of public school to be home schooled. This is the point where the abuse in the home really became a lot worse. For two years, I was essentially stuck at a dining room table to do schoolwork for about 6-9 hours a day. If I was late getting to the table, every minute added another 30 minutes to my time. I attempted suicide at nine and life resumed as if nothing happened. This type of schooling proved to be incredibly exhausting for my mother, so she told me that she had given up on my education and was going to focus on my brother (GC) and my little sister to be (note: she was very pregnant at the time). I fucked off for a year and then started self schooling. I felt so isolated and I made desperate attempts to go back to public school every year from 7th-10th grade, but I honestly gave up my junior year.\n\nBecause of my mother's issues with mental health, holding a job was very difficult for her and she became a stay at home mom in order to square that circle. My step dad worked night and day to financially support us, and still we were pretty poor. Caring for all of us was very difficult for them, so I was responsible for much of the caretaking of the younger children.\n\nOver the next couple of years I found myself in a lot of dangerous situations personally with drugs and stupid friends. I ended up having another suicide attempt at 15.\n\nFast forward to when I somehow magically figured out how to get into the college in town with a home school transcript I made on Microsoft word...\n\nI was abusing PCP in an attempt to numb myself to my current situation. I was working to pay for school, outings with my siblings (so they wouldn't have to be in the house), my living expenses, etc. I ended up getting clean around the end of my first semester freshman year somehow only failing one class. I took classes the next semester, but I was driven to drop out by mom to help her start a farmer's market stand. Shortly afterward, I was kicked out of the house and she had cut contact with me because I was working another job at the same time. \n\nMy contact with her was patchy for a couple months and she attempted to \"repair things\" when I made a move to the west coast. We talked with some frequency for six months and I came out for a visit after having attempted suicide. She banished me from the home after an argument and I was lucky to have my grandmother come pick me up. My mom and I had patchy contact then for another year and a half and then finally I cut her off. \n\nThe extent of the abuse I experienced is so much that it is hard to pinpoint specific positive events from my childhood. I am constantly uncovering new found memories from my childhood and it is incredibly traumatizing. \n\nI am currently seeing a therapist and a psychiatrist, which is great, but I would just really like to commiserate with others who have survived. Thanks for listening. \n\n",

Some of them are a direct result of having been RBN, and I think a lot of my brutal panic and feeling of no support and isolation are also a direct result of being RBN. I am completely and utterly terrified that I am making an irreversible mistake in some point of my life. \n\nI recently left my abusive Ngrandmother's house and did a seasonal job 1900 miles away (if this sounds familiar it's because I did post here earlier this year), knowing it would end and that I would need to find a more permanent situation. After that job, I went through 4 months of homelessness back near but not in the town of my Nparents. \n\nI just started a wonderful but terribly low-paying job that I'm probably going to have leave very soon for a higher-paying but probably not nearly as fun job. I'm terrified that I'm going to lose the friendship I've made with an awesome coworker there. I'm terrified that the new job is going to be SO bad that I'm going to want to quit. Also, today I got the key of the house where I am renting a room, and I'm terrified that I'm going to screw that up somehow, that the job situation will make that nearly impossible if the jobs don't work out, or that I'm going to hate where it is (it is in a tiny town that feels in the middle of nowhere but is about 20 minutes from work in one direction, and 20 in the direction of where I was recently homeless, a town I refuse to give up at all right now). However, it's not permanent, and in 6 months if everything really is that bad I am able to get out of the lease/that house. \n\nI also was recently dating for two months, and that ended last night after my boyfriend had screamed at me, which is an enormous trigger for me and also just plain abusive behavior, and he didn't really seem to care. However, he WAS supportive in general these past two months, and I have lost a lot of that support by having to end that relationship, despite that ending it was probably healthier for us both than to continue. \n\nI'm just about ready to completely have a huge breakdown, and underlying all of this terror is reeling from having to deal with C-PTSD-like symptoms. I do have a therapist but not enough due to having a lack of coverage with all of these changes going on. Plus there is having been told so many times by Nmom that I will fail and that I can't keep a job (false) and things like nobody likes me (having a weak to non-existent support system makes that feel true). \n\nI don't know how to deal with any of this at all.

I think it makes it worse that my only contact with this movie was the NEx comparing me to the antagonist so to portray me as crazy and unstable to everyone around me.  How do you get over this?

        "text": "I've been NC with my Nfather for about 3 years and only stopped talking to my Nmom a few months ago. This was hard because they're still married. It took a long time to see she wasn't just under his spell and as much of victim of his abuse I was, but rather that she made a lot of conscious decisions to be a stupid fucking dirtbag and play the victim rather than protecting her children.\n\nAs a kid, I was never allowed to cry, for any reason. If I was physically hurt, I was being dramatic and there was no way it could hurt that bad. If I was scared or upset, I was being ridiculous and needed to calm down. If I was sad or angry because someone in my family had wronged me, well that was absolutely not tolerated because then I was doing it to make them feel bad. I got conditioned not to let it out, to anyone, ever.\n\nFast forward to me being 32, NC, doing EMDR therapy with a wonderful counselor, and on a really good cocktail of SSRIs that seem to be working well. Now that my depressions is under control, I'm dealing with PTSD that I didn't know was a separate thing, and trying to process all my trauma from growing up. \n\nI had a lot of sex back in my day, but this is the first time I've ever been in LOVE. I have great friendships but have never been able to be vulnerable with anyone in a romantic way and never cared enough about anyone to bother to fight with them. My SO and I have been together 3 years now and we live together, so every day is a new terrifying adventure in uncharted waters. SO is awesome. He comes from a delightfully bland family where no one is controlling or passive aggressive at all and their biggest family secret is pretending that his mom's baked chicken is good when it's actually terrible. \n\nSo the problem is that every time we have any kind of fight at all I end up having a panic attack. He's not mean, he doesn't attack or gaslight or name call, he's super rational, but I can't talk to him about conflict without being triggered and having a meltdown. He then comforts me and holds me and tells me to let it out and in those times I can actually allow myself to cry. He doesn't really get it, but he gets it enough to help me get through it and it's amazing.\n\nBut I also hate it. I want to fight like a normal couple, whatever that means. I hate him holding me after we've been yelling at each other because it makes me feel so weak and stupid and terrible-- which is what happens in all of my panic attacks. It's to the point now that if he says or does something annoying, my mind flips into fight or flight right away and before I know it I'm hiding in a closet crying, barely able to breathe, and doing all of my EMDR tricks to keep it at bay because I can't stand feeling weak in front of him and I feel like I'm my mother-- making every situation about me and forcing everyone to care for me, even if they're mad at me. I don't know if I'm even looking for advice here, but I'm writing this because it's what's happening right now. I made a joke about his ex wife that he took offense to and he had every right to take offense. But now I'm sitting in the bedroom with the door closed muttering repetitive prayers under my breathe and trying to breathe. I wish I could break out of this cycle. Any kind words will help.",

So accused of something correct but by the wrong people. But the next day she came to tell me that she has no concerns and I'm doing well. I just smiled and nodded and confirmed what she said. The only dig she tried to get in was about her alleged concerns over my boundaries but she has no basis. I didn't even acknowledge it. She's been sickeningly sweet since probably trying to cover her ass. We do have a meeting (my whole team) with the boss above her next week. Everyone is a bit nervous but I'm actually ok. There was some other drama but I wasn't a part of it. I plan on just sitting and listening. Worst case they fuss at us. \n\nNanny drama-\nShe never returned our key, so as I told her I would do, I filed a petition with juvenile intake. We got a leer letter today basically saying they aren't taking it to the court but they are handling it through a program they have. It said she has to comply with certain things like never contacting our family again. So my husband assumes this means she can't take us to small claims court (&amp; even if she did, she has no case). So a satisfying ending to some craziness. ",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAfterNarcissism/comments/560q6j/security_clearance_a_guideline_for_foc/",
        "text": "A lot of times when we limit contact with the N’s in our life, we shut out a huge part (or even the entirety) of our family. This can be really stressful and scary, because even a toxic support is still a support in our lives. A lot of us have to build large and more importantly strong support networks to heal from this – namely friendships!\n\nWhen thinking about friendships in the context of our abuse, it’s helpful to divide them up in “Levels of Security Clearance”.\n\n#Security Level 0: Greetings Stranger!#\n\nThese are people you might recognize by sight, but probably don’t know their last name. The barista at the coffee shop you frequent, your mechanic, or even your neighbors. While you can certainly have frequent conversations with these folks, most of them (like 99%) do not turn move up in terms of clearance. \n\nRule #1 with this level of clearance is being a good conversationalist. Example: I frequent a special coffeehouse before therapy every week, and there is a barista there who is always bored at 5:30 before closing. I always strike up a good conversation and be as personable as I can (because I love doing it, and it hopefully is enjoyable to pass the time for him too). But if another customer comes up, I’m out of his way lickety split and don’t bother him afterwards. \n\nPointers: Have questions, even simple ones! People love to talk about themselves or what they do. Try not to ask huge open ended questions, and remember this gets better with time. Example: I was going to the hospital to visit my grandma when a doctor entered the elevator. I was feeling like talking so I asked “So what’s your specialty?”  He said “I’m a neurogastroenterologist.” “Wow!” I said” What’s the connection between the brain and the gut? They’re kinda different” And promptly as he was starting to explain, I had to leave for my floor. Oops!\n\nBeware: #1 Make absolutely certain the person is having fun! Unfortunately this is usually communicated in body language and tone of voice, so it’s harder to know without study. #2 Make sure they have time. You don’t want to be “that customer” that takes up time when they are trying to politely move to the next person. \n\n#Security Level 1: Hobby Buddies#\n\nThese people are people that you probably know their last name, have their phone number and more than one social media connection to. The number of how many Level 1 people are in your life varies a lot, due to falling out of touch with people or eventually realizing they are more of a part of your life (level 2). I currently have 5-6, and I’ve known them for over a week to 6 months, to many times even a year.\n\nRule #1 of Security Level 1 is not to overshare. We are working through trauma as ACONs and we really REALLY want to be loved and cared for. That’s why therapy is so helpful for us! But we need to remember our Security Level 1 folks are not the right people for sharing our jagged edges. We don’t know them well enough and they don’t know us yet! The most appropriate level of sharing is “Hey dude, rough day, wanna grab a beer?”\n\nPointers: The easiest way to find Level 1 folks are to start a social hobby. This can be anything: sports, games, crafts, and the list goes on! Living in a major metropolitan area is also very helpful, because the likelihood of finding a group of people who like what you do too is more likely. \n\nBeware: Make sure you are having fun. If you are not having fun, try something different! It’s ok to waffle a lot around this, especially when you are starting anew.\n\n#Security Level 2: Bread and Butter#\n\nThese people have been in your life for probably a year or so, and this phase can last for easily 6 years. You have a number of hilarious stories that you can talk about, “Remember when we….”. Chances are if the person got married, you would be invited in the wedding but not be in the wedding party (or vice versa). You may have helped this person move or driven them to the airport at an ungodly hour. These people make up the bulk of your family of choice, and I feel the transition from Level 1 to Level 2 is more of a natural “Huh, Jerry is a really cool guy!” than a scenario where they bailed you out somehow. I currently have 4, but again, adjust as your needs make sense.\n\nRule #1 is Balance! Take the 1v5 guideline: for every one negative thing, it takes five positive things to offset it. While it’s not to be taken out of context as an equation for healthy relationships, having 5 positive things (jokes, cat pictures, happy outcome) within a relative timeline around the negative thing is very important. You’ve probably complained to this person about a bad day, but not in gritty detail. \n\nRule #2 These people are not your therapist! It’s really REALLY hard and takes a ton of practice not to break this rule. Don’t beat yourself up, and get to therapy as soon as you can. They might know your relationship with your parents is strained, but you’ve never called it abuse. You may gripe or commiserate together but OVERALL your relationship is positive (see rule 1). \nPointers: Take a look at how you feel about the relationship and make sure you “click”. If you aren’t “clicking” then it’s ok. \n\nBeware: Be patient! This stuff takes time! A healthy Level one tribe will eventually and naturally progress to a healthy Level two tribe. If people fall out of level one and you are scared/upset because you’d like the support of level two, relax!  It will happen on its own naturally. Make sure you click with people.\n\n#Security Level 3: Family is not always Blood#\n\nThese people have been in your life consistently in an overall positive way for more than 7 years probably. You’ve been through a least one major life phase (someone getting married, moving away from each other for longer than a year, children, or maybe death of a blood family member). You would likely get pulled aside and told the person was getting married before the Facebook announcement. You also would probably be in the wedding party, if not the best man or maid/matron of honor. An outsider probably could not tell you are Level 3, as you communicate very much like Level 2 most of the time. \n\nThe difference for a Level 2 and 3 for me personally was when I decided to come out of the closet about being an ACON. The first time I did, I had a problem I was working through and I realized the only way to explain how I felt was by letting my best friend know that I was viciously beaten as a kid and adult. For me, it wasn’t a tear-filled emotional moment. I just realized it was time because I knew we’d make it through even if she didn’t understand what being abused was like. We’d been through two major life phases (I had lived in a different country for a year, she’s gotten married) and we had been friends for 5 years. \n\nI hope this guideline helps people! With therapy and some hard work, we’ll all be on our ways to making our family of choice. \n\n\n",

It's not a compliment or a good thing, I just often seem very young because I was so developmentally stunted from abuse.\n\nAnyway, I work the 3rd shift at my job. I've worked many different kinds of shifts in my life, and 3rd shift always came out on top as my favorite, so I was more than happy to take a stable position that's solely on 3rd shift. I did my training on first shift, and I got a ton of \"oh poor you!\" comments, but I just responded by telling people that I prefer 3rd shift. People didn't listen, but whatever, I don't have to listen to them anymore.\n\nExcept for one person who is part-time, and sometimes works an hour or two into 3rd shift. It's pretty incessant. Every time I work with her, I get at least a few comments about how unfortunate it is that I have to work third shift, and how much she hates third shift, and how difficult working 3rd shift is for her. \n\nIt just strikes me a reminiscent of my Narc parents, who seem to think that if they don't like something, no one must like it. I can tell her that, no, it's not unfortunate because I prefer it, and it's not difficult for me at all, but she doesn't listen. Last night she got super in depth, asking me about my sleep schedule and whatnot. I politely answered her question, telling her that I prefer to go to bed when I get home and then get up in the afternoon, and she started getting really over-the-top with the pity. \"But then you just have so much time before work!\" To which I respond, \"I like having time in the afternoon and evening.\" But she was just laying it on so thick. \"Oh, how much time you have before work. There's just so much time before work...\" I wanted to leave the room. She was driving me up the wall. I just wanted to scream at her, \"Look young lady, your preferences are not universal!\"\n\nSo, what I think makes this matter even more annoying, is that this lady is younger than I am by about five to ten years, which is even weirder. I'm pretty sure she thinks I'm younger than she is. At least, I *hope* she thinks I'm younger than she is, the way that she treats me would be super inappropriate if she knew my actual age. She's *so* patronizing.\n\nAnyway, does anyone else get super triggered by shit like this? I only have to work with her a couple hours a week, so that's a huge plus. When I have to work with her, though, after she leaves I feel like I have to wind down for a bit, because I'm so irritated.",

Here I was scrolling, scrolling and them BAM... messages from my sexually abusive mother, my enabling step-mother, my flying monkey cousin, my dysfunctional ex-boyfriend, etc.   It was years worth of blocked stuff or messages from people I didn't think to block, but that I definitely would block if I knew they had messaged me.\n\nIt was shocking.  I feel ill.  \n\nI'm lost in the damn FOG again.  If I feel this way, surely I must be the problem, right?  My mother was trying to be nice, surely... right?  I'm sure all these people think I'm troubled and insane, so I must be, right?  \n\nOkay, I know rationally that all this is bullshit, but I still feel it very strongly.  I'm trying to stay grounded, but it is not easy...\n\nFor those of you who are now concerned about your block settings, I'm not sure if these people were technically blocked, so the fault may have been mine.  My mother was definitely blocked, but she was blocked under this fake name she used on FB at the time.  The message was from an account that had her real name, so maybe she has a new account that I need to block?  Or maybe the blocked messages come through on FB messenger app?  I don't know.  I believe my step-mother was blocked, but I unblocked her at one point to see pictures of my step-nephew (who I miss dearly) and maybe I forgot to reblock her?  FB doesn't let you re-block people right away... at least, they didn't at the time.  I think they make you wait a while.  I might have forgotten to reblock?  I don't know.  Other people may be more familiar with the settings.  Since I wasn't getting nasty stuff in my inbox, I figured my settings were okay, but maybe they weren't...\n\nI don't care that much about the technicalities.  I care that I saw messages from these people and I now feel poisoned and guilty and confused and like maybe I should call my mother and apologize for cutting contact after the millionth disgusting thing she did to me...  \n\nYeah, I won't do that, but I feel like I should.  I hope this feeling goes away soon.  :(\n\nSupport please?  ",

        "text": "Hi - I don't understand how this can be.  The despair and loneliness I feel are almost unbearable.  I hated how he made me feel in our relationship, yet there were good times (few and far between).  I know that I did the right thing, but seeing him with another woman is almost too much to handle.  For years, I was conditioned to try everything I could to keep him interested in me - I failed, as he was always flirting and sexting with other girls.  But I thought I could show him how much I was invested in him and loved him, and he would change.  He never did, though.  Will I always feel this terrible?  I can't even bare to get another guy's phone number (we broke up in February) and he's been doing a lot more than just that.  I feel like my soul was devoted to him, despite how badly he was treating me.  It's so frustrating - I should feel happy, yet I do not.  I am jealous of a girl getting treated how I once did.  I remember how good it felt to be liked by someone.  But then it faded.",
