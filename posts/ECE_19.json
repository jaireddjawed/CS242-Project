I've only ever used Arduino and KLZ series ARM boards from NXP. I'm still an Engineer in training!\n\nIf anything like this exists please let me know! If not, do you have information on how to design custom Micro-controllers from scratch.\n\nThank you!",

Embed copper wires going thru, then oven, then all the normal steps.\n\nFlat clay could be rectangular clay tablet, but clay is stronger when circular like normal food plate. If 1 cm wide airflow holes are dispersed on the circuit disk, they could affect strength.\n\nMaybe get to a local clay making pottery class, while there make a funny jar or cup, then the circuit board.\n\nShould it be some other ceramics than pottery clay?",

To put it bluntly, I'm feeling rather unsure of my career trajectory.. a few things of note:\n\n1) Salary: perhaps this is a local issue, but the hardware/semiconductor industry does not seem to be very attractive when it comes to pay, especially when compared to other industries.\n\n2) Mobility: Is it just me, or there seems to be a huge skill gap in this area of EE? Either you start as a junior engineer doing testing, or be a design engineer so long as you have +8 years of experience in X, Y, Z skill.\n\n3) Future-proofing: Given that the semiconductor industry is slowing down, or how some people call it, \"maturing\", I can't help but feel like this is not a good thing. The rapid consolidation of companies does not seem to bode well from the employee's perspective.\n\nI don't know about you guys, but the idea of being in an EIT (Engineer-in-Training) track under a utilities company like BC Hydro sounds like a good choice in the long run, especially as someone that would love to be in project management one day. Green energy projects maybe?\n\nSorry if this seems like a word barf, but I'm happy to spark a discussion on this for anyone feeling similarly..",

One specific book recommended on the class site was Computer as Components.\n\nI read the whole book and it basically gave a better in\\-depth version of what your average pro\\-consumer, gamer knows about computer parts: CPU, memory, cache, I/O. Granted it goes a bit more in detail with bus data transmission time, examples of C/C\\+\\+ code, UML diagrams of different systems like an alarm clock, a car's engine/ABS controls, PIC, TI C55x, ARM chips, etc.\n\nBut this is the second textbook I've purchased trying to prepare myself and I felt like I haven't learned much compared to what a computer technician or software support specialist would already know. I read an undergrad OS textbook which basically covered the software side of the above book and briefly mentioned the Internet/networking and RTOS.\n\nI thought I would have a better understanding of SystemC, VxWorks, and VHDL by now. I felt like I wasted over 3 weeks of time reading intro books.\n\nAlso, is there like a roadmap of some kind that can streamline the topics a student/potential employee would need to know to be well\\-educated AND well\\-trained in an ECE subject? Textbooks that the whole community agrees that if you read this or watch these series of youtube videos, then you are well\\-versed in the subject matter.\n\nFor example, this video really helped me understand web dev: [https://youtu.be/sBzRwzY7G\\-k](https://youtu.be/sBzRwzY7G-k)\n\nI feel like I am all over the place with things I need to learn so I am reading anything and everything, when I should be focusing portion at a time.",

I realize that the time to apply for a summer internship passed months ago. My academic portfolio was in shambles at the beginning of the semester, and after a lot of hard work I feel confident in my resume now that grades are in and I was able to complete a bunch of personal/club projects, but obviously this isn't the most opportune time.\n\nIf possible I would like to find an internship or part time job. My current plan was just to search a bunch of websites like Indeed and hope I get an answer back, but given my unique situation, I felt like maybe I should approach this differently? I cannot apply to any full time positions yet. I would prefer just a summer internship, however I'm really open to anything that still lets me complete my final semester.\n\nMy current plan was to contact the school/department for advice and use every job listing website known to man. I currently have a part time job and I am on good enough terms with the company to the point where I can just leave whenever, I just really feel like the time I am spending there is an utter waste and really holding me back since it is completley unrelated work. So should I just continue as planned, or is there anything I should know before I start. \n",

I think I basically understand the whole thing except two specific points regarding section 8 on Electrical Hazards.... okay 3. Oh... and I think anyone that knows IEC60950 couldl answer this stuff, too.\n\n\\- The whole standard is about setting up isolation barriers between dangerous and safe circuits. To figure out the requirements for the barrier, you need to work out the working voltage across that barrier. It seems like the way you do that is to take the highest/lowest voltages on either side of the barrier and assume that no fault condition could ever produce a greater voltage across the barrier and voila... working voltage. \\*Question:\\* If I have two isolated circuits \\(i.e. one floating with respect to the other, or even one ground referenced and the other floating\\), how can I define the greatest voltage that could appear across the barrier between them?\n\n\\-If I take that same floating circuit and ground reference it, does that change anything about the isolation barrier required around it? If I had 1 MOP between a floating circuit and a protectively earthed enclosure \\(assuming I worked out the answer to the above question ahha\\), and then I ground reference the circuit, is my 1 MOP now worthless because they aren't isolated \\(you sure can't do a hi\\-pot test on it\\) and my functional insulation to circuit ground is now functional insulation to the enclosure? This has stumped me time and time again. Can you only ever have one ground referenced circuit in a system, since two ground referenced circuits could never be tested for isolation because a ridiculous current would flow during a hi\\-pot test? \\*Question:\\* Does floating a circuit somehow lessen the requirements surrounding the isolation barrier placed around it?\n\n\\- The standard briefly mentions using resistors to bridge across an isolation barrier. In that case, the resistor has to meet a variety of conditions that make sense \\(multiple resistors in series, power rating not exceeded, fail open etc.\\). But it says they have to withstand a hi\\-pot test. \\*Question:\\* How the heck could a resistor of any reasonable value survive several kV? Even 1M ohm would dissipate more than 1W \\(V\\^2/R\\). Is there any practical example of this technique that would make sense?",

I previously created one that polled all 8 (I only had 8 buttons then) input lines to see if any of them had changed and sent a MIDI note to the computer if a button had been pressed.  The problem was that it wasn't that great when two buttons were pressed at the same time and often was slow. \n\nI want to write a new version that has the buttons connected to an interrupt line to decrease latency.  The problem is, I don't think it's common for microcontrollers to have 16 interrupt pins.  My arduino has 1 interrupt pin so I was thinking about tying all buttons to the interrupt line AND an input line this way they all trigger the interrupt and the ISR polls the lines to see which of the 16 buttons triggered the interrupt.  This may save some time but I still would like to get away from polling all 16 lines.  Possibly if I get a micro with 4 interrupt lines I could split the 16 up and only have to poll 4 lines per interrupt?  \n\nAnyway, does anyone have any feedback on how I can tackle this?  Are micros with 16 interrupt lines common?  Is there a common strategy for handling situations like this?  I'm not opposed to using DMA however I haven't learned about it in my class yet so I can't say whether or not it's a better solution.\n\nThanks",
