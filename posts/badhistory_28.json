First time attempting this but feel free to call me out if it appears I don't know what I'm talking about.\n\n So while searching for music to zone out to while reading /r/lifeofnorman, I found [this song] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75F5RaU5wSM) that contained several cases of bad history (besides just the horrendous map at [0:55] (https://youtu.be/75F5RaU5wSM?t=55s) and Mini-Napolean)\n\n\n&gt;[0:01] (https://youtu.be/75F5RaU5wSM?t=1s) Several million years ago a prehistoric man...\n\n\nAnyone who didn't rely on The Flintstones for their knowledge of human evolution will know that man evolved *pretty damn far* from this, so the video isn’t starting out to hot. \n\n\n&gt;[0:28] (https://youtu.be/75F5RaU5wSM?t=28s) The Mongols invaded Japan\n\n\n \nThe Mongols *tried* to invade Japan twice and while there were failed miserably due to having most of their fleet sunk, *twice*. \n\n\n&gt;[0:50] (https://youtu.be/75F5RaU5wSM?t=50s) The Germans invaded the French, the Germans invaded the Czechs, the German invaded the Netherlands and they invaded North Africa next! The Germans invaded the Balkans, and they almost invaded in Spain along with the Soviet regions, the Poles, the Norwegians, the Belgians the Brits and the Danes!\n\n\nWhile I can ignore the fact that they didn’t get it in order chronologically (after all they are trying to make a catchy  song appealing to the ~10 age bracket, not make a competent list), they do state that Germany invaded North Africa (which I guess sounds better than “The Italians invaded North Africa, lost hard, and begged the Germans for help”). This part of the video also says that Germany invaded Britain and while the British *did* suffer from German rockets and aerial bombings, this can hardly be thought of as a [proper invasion] (http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/invasion).\n\n\n&gt;[1:04] (https://youtu.be/75F5RaU5wSM?t=1m4s) The French invaded the English\n\n\nThis is actually somewhat true, as in the past the French *did* successfully invade the English (e.g. The Norman invasion, The Hundred Years war, etc.) but my problem with this scene is the use of Napoleon, who definitely did not come close to invading British Isles. This may be more misleading than actually incorrect.\n\n\n&gt;[1:37] (https://youtu.be/75F5RaU5wSM?t=1m36s) And the Hatfields fought the McCoys\n\n\n\nFamily feud that resulted 12 dead over the course of 15 years = full on invasion?\n\n\n\n&gt;[1:51] (https://youtu.be/75F5RaU5wSM?t=1m51s) Pizarro invaded the Incas and the Dutch invaded Brazil\n\n\nOther than Pizarro using an incorrect flag for the time and some Incan colonization in Argentina, this part appears to be fine fine. \n\n\n&gt;[1:55] (https://youtu.be/75F5RaU5wSM?t=1m55s) Napoleon invaded the Austrians, proving artillery works\n\n\nIt is well known that the ever-clever Napoleon able to prove to the other European powers that this new fangled ‘cannon’ was a worthy weapon and not just a big round thing that made your ears hurt by using his wit and cunning  creating the world's first time machine and introducing it to the continent more than [600 years prior] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_cannon#cite_ref-23)\n\n ",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/3qi1rt/disneys_vicious_slander_of_john_ratcliffes_good/",
        "text": "So I watched Disney's Pocahontas for the first time this weekend. I knew that they had taken some serious artistic license with their depiction of the English colonization of Virginia, but I was in no way ready for the absolutely appalling slanders that the screenwriters lobbed at the good name of Governor John Ratcliffe.\n\nHe is a fat, greedy, cruel, racist, distrustful bastard in this movie. His racism and suspicious nature almost single-handedly start a war between the colonists and the Powhatan Confederacy. He is also shown greedily gorging himself on food, which the settlers may or may not have enough of, the movie doesn't say. Let us take a moment to examine the life and legacy of the real John Ratcliffe.\n\nMuch of Ratcliffe's life before his involvement in the Virginia Company is shrouded in mystery. He certainly had sailing experience, which would mean he was probably much tougher and more hardy than the foppish aristocrat depicted in the film. His involvement in the Virginia Company came at the behest of Robert Cecil, Secretary of State under King James (and Elizabeth before him). The exact nature of their relationship is difficult to pin down as Cecil was extremely secretive about this first English attempt to colonize North America (so there would have been no one loudly singing songs about Glory, God, and Gold in the New World as the ships left England), but he trusted Ratcliffe enough to name him captain of the Discovery, one of three ships that the settlers sailed upon.\n\nJamestown was not a politically stable settlement and only a year after landfall in 1607, then-Governor Edward Wingfield was deposed and replaced by Ratcliffe. With the guidance and leadership of Ratcliffe, depicted in the movie as so distrustful of Native Americans that he recklessly encourages the settlers to shoot first and ask questions later, the settlers set up a trade network with the local indigenous populations along the James River. Now, in the end of his term as governor, there are some passing similarities to his characterization in the film: he was accused of hoarding food for himself by the settlers. But this accusation must be taken with a huge grain of salt. Starvation plagued the settlers in Jamestown's earliest years, as for reasons that historians disagree upon, they initially didn't grow food ~~(people will tell you it was because the settlers were wealthy fools who thought it was beneath them to work, and there may be some truth to that, but most of them had military careers, and its doubtful that none of them had any experience working with their hands. I'm of the view that they were just gold-crazy and not thinking ahead. but I digress~~ EDIT: THIS IS NOT REALLY AN INTERPRETATION THAT FITS CURRENT SCHOLARSHIP. SEE BOTTOM OF THIS POST). In such extreme circumstances, paranoia was common, and many latent hostilities were expressed in accusations of hoarding food (Wingfield had been accused of the very same by his enemies before he was deposed). There are also reports that he demanded a capital building be constructed, which did not please the hungry settlers. Either way, he stepped down or was removed from governorship in the autumn of 1608. It is worth noting that during his tenure as governor, John Smith, who believed in a militaristic, agressive approach to dealing with Native Americans, accused him of being far too trusting and generous with them (indeed Ratcliffe would have been following Cecil and King James' orders to treat the natives respectfully. In classic English fashion they figured that they would do a much more civilized job of colonizing the New World than the brutal Spanish).\n\nThe end of John Ratcliffe the following year is a large part of why I find his depiction in Pocahontas so annoying. In 1609, at the beginning of what would later be known as \"the starving time\" wherein a large majority of the Jamestown population died of starvation, Ratcliffe headed an expedition to meet with members of the Pamunkey nation, who had promised to trade corn for their goods. Unfortunately for Ratcliffe, it was a trap. Most of the men were slaughtered by the Pamunkey but Ratcliffe was captured alive, and what they did to him next was not fun. Taken back to the Pamunkey camp, Ratcliffe was \"bound unto a tree naked with a fire before, and by women his flesh was scraped from his bones with mussel shells, and, before his face, thrown into the fire.\" Once the flesh of his face had been removed and burned, he was burned at the stake.\n\nThis annoys me because if the real Ratcliffe had been a little less trusting and a little more like villain Ratcliffe, he probably would not have experienced a hideous, excruciating death at the hands of the Pamunkey. But that's not my only problem with this fucking movie.\n\nI think their whole approach to the story is irresponsible. Racism, for the most part, is depicted as something that evil people force onto dull-witted good people. Without Ratcliffe's pernicious influence, it's doubtful that any of the fictional colonists would have had any serious conflict with the virtuous Powhatan confederacy, ruled as it was by wisdom and nature and shit. These colonists were early modern men, and they were frequently poor and desperate to get ahead so they probably would have been greedy, selfish, and distrustful in their own rights, attributes that Ratcliffe holds a monopoly on in Disney's Pocahontas. This villain-based approach to social ills removes all responsibility from your average man, assuming that people can only commit crimes against humanity when a bad guy tricks them into doing this (I think of that dumb dumb chain letter thing going around where an old german lady supposedly claims that the nazis rose to power by promising a well-run, large welfare state when in fact that Nazis' murderous anti-semitism was quite popular with plenty of Germans).\n\nSo I guess this is kind of long-winded, and I haven't said half of what I set out to say when I started. I drew largely from benjamin Wooley's *Savage Kingdom: Virginia and the Founding of English America*, and just a teeeeeeeny bit from wikipedia. I love this sub and I hope this, my first submission, is adequate! \n\nEDIT: /u/Vagamuffins has pointed out that current scholarship on the starving time in Jamestowne argues that the land the English settled on was largely unfit for agriculture -- since it was mostly sand and marshland -- and that starvation occurred after a dependable supply of fishable sturgeon in surrounding waterways ceased to exist, depriving the settlers of  their main source of food. These circumstances were beyond the control of even the most hardworking settler.",

        "text": "Gather round children. I'm Mama Cats and I have some exciting news for my bad little kittens. In the scared spirit of Hawai’ian Dreadnaughts, I am proud to announce:\n\n**r/badhistory: THE GAME**\n\nI bet you are as excited as a salamander up Solomon Spalding’s ass, but simmer down and let me highlight some of this exciting game’s features!\n\nImagine combining the glorious nature of r/badhistory with the unbeaten might of the German Panzer. Just look at the [main board](http://i.imgur.com/O2w4mVs.png). The main map is split into the [seven traditional continents](http://i.imgur.com/YgBfUXB.png) of: America, the Golden Circle, Shit America, Europe, [Mar Nuestro]( http://www.faculty.fll.vt.edu/Folkart/Database%20Project/maps/map3.gif), Rhodesia, Mongolia, and Polynesia. \n\nWe wanted to emulate WWI’s lack of tactics, but with our sergeant's understanding of the importance of attacking the enemy, much of the rules follow those of the game Risk. The game is one won by either controlling all providences or completing the Victory Spiral. \n\nLet’s give you a glimpse at some gameplay! To start, each player first selects their [avatar]( http://i.imgur.com/RR98E7Q.png).\n\nNext, each player rolls the dice to decide choosing order, with the highest going first. Each player, in order, takes a turn choosing a providence until all are chosen. Remember to choose the provenience of your providence carefully!\n\nIf some players get more providence than other players, it is now a battle game! If you received more providence, you’re on Team Calvinists. If you get less, you’re on the hungry hungry Australians Team. They learned the hard way that throwing boomerangs at the Russians on the eastern front was dumb, but they were doomed to fail anyway!\n\nAt the beginning of the player’s turn, if she or he controls a continent, she gains one point. This point can be saved, or spend any time during their turn. His point can be either spent on a victory point or unlocking her a new special bonus. Next, he or she gets a base of five troops plus any continent bonus for controlling one of her/his dominions:\n\n* America: 7  \n* Golden Circle: 5  \n* Shit America: 4  \n* Europe: -1  \n* Mar Nuestro: 6  \n* Rhodesia: 4  \n* Mongolia: 9  \n* Polynesia: 1  \n\nAll the fighting and dicing rolling is the same as Risk, just look it up. But none of that stacking like a thousand dudes in one place and freight-training across the board bullshit. That’s why we stopped inviting you over, *David*.\n\nAnyway, here’s the [Victory Spiral](http://i.imgur.com/YUA3s90.png). For each point you spend, you get to advance in your understanding of the Universe! After Norse Polytheism, it costs four points to advance each step due to the [Dark Ages]( http://commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/timeline.png). When you finally reach the ultimate Secret Knowledge^TM (Sikhism), the Guru Nanak comes down from heaven to personally 360/noscope all those heathens with his dope-ass [kamehameha wave]( http://www.glitters20.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Guru-Nanak-Dev-Jayanti-21.gif). Congrats, you win! No more Kirpan restrictions, saint soldiers!\n\nHowever, if you are a connoisseur of blackjack and hookers, don’t worry! Winning through slaughtering the other players and world conquest, known as *jihad*, is available. When a player loses all of her providences, she is out of the game (unless another player chooses to gift her one providence to keep her in the game; this is the Trail of Tears Rule). When there is only one player left, she wins! \n\nIn order to promote this sectarian violence, we have the [special ability board]( http://i.imgur.com/XHTI86g.png). Instead of spending your hard earned points on stupid enlightenment, why not go full on [crusaders](https://i.imgur.com/owDkNYu.png)? Each point spent unlocks another bonus, with five bonus per tier and five tiers total. Here is the bonus breakdown (each bonus lines up with a picture of the board). \n\n**Stone Age:**  \nVolcano Sacrifice: Nothing happens  \nFertility Cults, Oh Yeah: + 5 troops  \nGilgamesh vs. Jörmungandr: +Two turns in a row  \n[Led Zeppelin Concert?]( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-9L3sLO_-zDA/Ty0sgvlNi7I/AAAAAAAAA7g/TILrV7o4BV0/s1600/led_zeppelin-swan_song-front.jpg): Do some heroin  \nNoah’s Arc: Next player gets no reinforcements next turn.  \n\n*(Other Tiers indev)*\n\nAs you can see, because this is a pre-order, we haven’t *actually* completed the game. But if you buy now, it will be done on launch day sometime in 2018 (probably!).\n\nBe aware that the avatar you chose effects how the game is played! Here are some examples of its complexity:\n\n* Horus turns into Jesus if you reach Christianity on the Victory Spiral.    \n    \n* Martin Heidegger can only win through jihad, because he is incapable of completing the last step in the Victory Spiral due to it being the End of History.    \n   \n* Jared Diamond starts seven victory points ahead because of his Germs, Guns, and Nippon Steel knowledge.   \n   \n* Daniel Jackson has to sit out his sixth turn.\n\nThe last game feature we’ll talk about today is everyone's favorite feature, copied straight from our favorite ~~genocide simulator~~ game ~~Euro-Wank~~ Europa Universalis IV! That's right, we got [trade nodes]( http://i.imgur.com/ucQR4Gp.png)! But much like Paradox, fuck you, we don’t have to actually explain how they work. You can just play this game another 400 hours and keep throwing DLC money at us, and we will think about it explaining it one day!\n\nThough, speaking of DLCs, for only $4USD extra, you can get the Nation of Islam AND Carl Sagan unit packs! Finally for, *I don’t know*, say $6GPB, you get the Holodomor and Armenian **Peaceful** Relocation load screen pack, full of interesting and informative quotes about these almost non-events!\n\nThat's all for today, volks. I hope all of you are excited as we are. With our expertise and your money, we will make the bombing of Dresden look like the Battle of Trafalgar! Whatever that means!\n\n**/rbadhistory: THE GAME**  \n\nPre-order now!\n",

        "text": "Good Afternoon! I was thinking that I should probably get to posting some bad history, considering I now help run the place (Yay!). \n\nAnyway, I have just returned my from Civil War class, and we talked about the effect women had on the war, and vice versa. Nurses were obviously brought up, and my professor pointed out a historical error by Barbie.\n\nSee: [Union Civil War Nurse Barbie](http://www.nursingschoolhub.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/7.-Civil-War-Nurse-Barbie-1996.jpg), [In a box](http://i.ebayimg.com/00/$(KGrHqEOKp!E3tGsMw(KBN+-3,4Lw!~~_35.JPG)\n\nNow in the Civil War, both the Union and the Confederacy had women nurses, Numbering around 9k and 1k respectively. This was unsurprisingly seen by many as a controversy. Women exposing themselves to such horrors of war, and, perhaps equally important, touching other men in several states of undress, was very unwomanly. A common thought was that ladies joined the war front in order to find husbands, or sex. The ~~Victorian age~~ ante-bellum period was weird. \n\nThis brings us to our next point: [Dorothea Dix](http://www.totalgettysburg.com/dorothea-dix.html). She became the Union superintendent of female nurses, and famously issued restrictions for nurses:\n\n- No nurses under 30 Years Old\n\n- Required to be 'plain looking'\n\n- They were to dress in **black or brown dresses** and were not allowed to wear jewelry of any kind.\n\nNow, no nurse was ever sent home for not being 'plain', but these other rules were followed. The purpose of these restrictions were to promote the idea that nurses were maternal figures, and not bachelorettes looking for husbands in all the wrong places. This ideology was also mirrored culturally in the south as well.  \n\nSo in conclusion,  this young, attractive, and blue/white dressed barbie does not look like a civil war nurse at the time. \n\nHistory 1, Barbie 0.\n\nP.S. Anyone know any other barbie dolls that aren't historically accurate? Edit: Or maybe are surprisingly accurate?",

        "text": "A friend posted [this clickbait monstrosity](http://www.tickld.com/x/33-things-americans-should-know-about-canada-seriously) on Facebook. I started a point by point analysis then gave up because it was so bad. But I'm too much of a pedant to let it go. Some bad history, some bad linguistics, some bad sociology, some bad social science. A virtual smorgasbord of bad. But the bad history was the most egregious, so I'll concentrate on that. Check /r/badeverything for the rest it.\n\nR5:\n\n1) Right off the bat we get this gem:\n\n&gt;1. Our president is called a Prime Minister.\n\n No. Our president is not called a prime minister. We don't have a president. A president and a prime minister are two different things and work for two different branches of government. Many countries have both a president and a prime minister, but the president is head-of-state. Our PM isn't even head-of-state. Queen Elizabeth is our head-of-state. More of misunderstanding of government than bad history, but if you knew your history when it comes to Westminster-style parliamentary systems, you wouldn't have made this mistake.\n\n2) This isn't history but it's so very very wrong.\n\n3)\n\n&gt;You don't have to be born in Canada to be Prime Minister. \n\nTrue, but the author really should have taken a moment to name the PM's who were not born in Canada.  John A. MacDonald and Alexander Mackenzie were born in Scotland, while Mackenzie Bowell and John Turner were both born in England.\n\n4) Not history, but definitely true.\n\n5) Not history, but also true. I am from rural Ontario. Can confirm.\n\n6) Not history, but a little bad. Canada's population is 35.15 million.\n\n7) ALRIGHT NOW WE GOT OURSELVES SOME GOOD OLD FASHIONED BAD HISTORY!\n\n&gt;In the War of 1812, we kicked your butts. The reason why your Whitehouse is white is because we set fire to it and it was whitewashed to hide the damage (for propaganda purposes). Some Americans will say that THEY won the war. However, to win, a party must reach their objective. Your objective was to take over British North America (what Canada was called then), our goal was to stop you. You don't have any more northern territory along the Canada/US border than you did before 1812. So who won? (Alaska doesn't count, you BOUGHT that state from Russia.)\n\n First, the White House was not painted white to hide the damage from the burning of Washington. That's a myth. The first whitewashing of the President's House (as it was know then) was in 1798, when it was being built, to protect the sandstone from weather damage. In addition, the building was colloquially called \"The White House\" beforehand.\n\n&gt;As early as the spring of 1811, Francis James Jackson, the former British minister to the United States, wrote that his successor would \"act as a sort of political conductor to attract the lightning that may issue from the clouds round the Capitol and the White House at Washington.\"\n\nThat quote is from the [Snopes page on this.](http://www.snopes.com/language/colors/whitehouse.asp) That's right, this nugget bad history is so oft-repeated it's got its own Snopes page.\n\nSecond, the United States' goal in the War of 1812 was not to annex British North America. That may have been a possible outcome, but it was never the reason for going to war. American merchant sailors were being pressed into service in the Royal Navy. The US trade system was being disrupted by the British on the high seas and restricted in their own markets. The British had entered into an alliance with and offered support to Tecumseh's Confederacy, which was fighting battles against William Henry Harrison and the American Army on the US's western frontier. Tecumseh fought alongside British troops in the [Siege of Detroit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Detroit). Canada's goal was not to defend itself from American attacks. Far more battles took place on the American side of the border than on the British side, so portraying the Canadians as defending themselves from American invaders is pretty inaccurate. Considering the number of British attacks stemming from Upper Canada and all over the other theatres of battle, if anything, [it was closer to the other way around.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_War_of_1812_Battles#Major_Theaters_of_the_War). Most of the American attacks on Upper Canada barely made it past the border.\n\n8) Oh good, bad sports history! I love this stuff. \n\n&gt;A form of baseball was played just outside of Toronto, Ontario three weeks before Alexander Doubleday played the 'first' game of baseball in your country.\n\nFirst of all, his name was *Abner* Doubleday, not Alexander Doubleday. Secondly, he didn't have a damn thing to do with the invention of baseball. Baseball was not \"invented\", but evolved from a variety of British game, including Cricket and Rounders (some info from Wikipedia [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origins_of_baseball)). A popular game known as \"Town Ball\" was played in the early 19th century in the States, and this is probably the game that directly led to baseball. A gentleman by the name of [Alexander Cartwright](http://baseballhall.org/hof/cartwright-alexander) was the first to set the rules of the game into writing in 1845 with his [*Rules and Regulations of the Knickerbocker Base Ball Club*](http://www.baseball-almanac.com/rule11.shtml) and has a much better claim than Doubleday to the title \"father of baseball\". As for the game \"just outside Toronto\" that the author refers to, that's what is [widely regarded as the first recorded baseball game in Canada on June 4th, 1838 in Beachville, ON.](http://baseballhalloffame.ca/2009/10/16/first-recorded-baseball-game/). But claiming this was the *first* baseball game is silly. There are plenty of records of forms of the game being played in the US long before 1838, though no journalistic records of the games themselves exist. The earliest reference to baseball in the US is a [1791 bylaw from Pittsfield, MA](http://www.pittsfieldlibrary.org/baseball.html), that prohibited baseball from being played within 80 yards of the town's meeting house.\n\nHonestly, if the author wanted to stake a claim to a popular American sport, he should have gone with gridiron (\"American\") football, as the collegiate game in Canada and the Grey Cup predate the American game and Super Bowl by a significant margin, and there are quite a lot of early records of football in Canada, including the first documented game at the University of Toronto on November 9, 1861, and the first written account of a game a year later at the Montreal Cricket Grounds, played between the Second Battalion Grenadier Guards and the Scots Fusilier Guards, then residing at the Montreal Garrison. More info [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_football#History). Football in the States seems to have its genesis in [1869](http://www.nfl.com/history/chronology/1869-1910). Also there's [James Naismith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Naismith), the Canadian inventor of basketball. So why the author chose baseball is beyond me. \n\n9)\n\n&gt;We do not find the term \"Canuck\" derogatory, like Americans find \"Yank\" derogatory. It apparently originated during World War One. Your soldiers were call \"doughboys\" ours were called \"Johnny Canucks\". I think the British coined the term, but I'm not sure. \n\n I'm not sure how often people claim the term \"Canuck\" is derogatory, but I can certainly tell you it was not coined by the Brits in World War I. In fact, [its first documented use was in the US in 1835](http://www.let.leidenuniv.nl/hsl_shl/DCHP-2/DCHP-2/DCHP-2.htm), as a term applied specifically to French Canadians. Although nowadays it applies to all Canadians as well as a certain pair of [Swedish identical twins](https://postmediavancouversun.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/sedins.jpg).\n\n10) I'm not going to get into this one on this sub, but I do take issue with the thought that Canadians are just \"unarmed Americans with healthcare\". There are quite a lot of unique elements to Canadian culture.\n\n11)\n\n&gt;Our national animal is the beaver. Sure it's just a rodent, but they're not even CLOSE to being extinct. \n\n The beaver is not endangered, but guess what? [Neither is the American Bald Eagle.](https://www.google.ca/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=bald%20eagle%20endangered%20status) The Bald Eagle was protected legally in 1940 when Congress passed the Bald Eagle Protection Act [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bald_and_Golden_Eagle_Protection_Act]. The bird bounced back so well, it was downgraded from [\"Endangered\" to \"threatened\" in 1995 and in 2007, was removed from the endangered species list altogether.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bald_and_Golden_Eagle_Protection_Act#Timeline)\n\n12) Not history, but don't make those kinds of generalizations, Mr. Author.\n\n13)\n\n&gt;We have Thanksgiving in October, so we don't look like copycats (it IS an American originated holiday, after all). However, we celebrate Christmas, Easter, Halloween, Passover and other holidays at the same time you do. \n\nIs Thanksgiving a holiday with American origins? Good question. A lot of historians argue that Thanksgiving is just an extension of the English Harvest Festival, which is so old it predates Christianity. But that's a lot of speculation. So what are the origins of Canadian Thanksgiving? There are two stories for the first Canadian Thanksgiving. One in 1578 when explorer [Martin Frobisher celebrated a proto-Thanksgiving with his crew on Newfoundland](http://www.canada.com/holidays/thanksgiving2005/story.html?id=74257801-d907-46e0-9bbd-c386515c6fe5), after surviving a particularly nasty voyage. The other possible proto-Thanksgiving was a celebration by Samuel de Champlain and the [Order of Good Cheer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_Good_Cheer) in the French settlements in the first decade of the 17th century. Both of these predate the Plymouth settlement, but neither immediately resulted in a continuously celebrated annual holiday. Now I'll be fair and say there's a bit of revisionism that may have gone on in order to give the first Thanksgiving to Canada, but it's not as if American Thanksgiving has been continuously celebrated since 1621, either. It's really just a better-known story.\n\n14) \n\n&gt;We were formed, as a nation, in 1867\n\nTo be more specific, we confederated three colonies into four provinces under one government in 1867, but I'll let that one slide. Canada's birth and formation was a much more gradual process than the US's 1776 declaration and subsequent revolution. But we need a birthday and July 1, 1867 is our best option.\n\n15) \n\n&gt;November the 11th is called Remembrance Day, up here. It is a day when all Canadians honour our war dead and the veterans who are still amongst us. Its significance is that on the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month the Armistice was signed, ending World War One. \n\nTrue enough, the Armistice took effect at [11 am, 11 November, 1918.](http://www.gwpda.org/1918/armistice.html). The document was signed at 5 am and the first condition is that it took effect 6 hours after signing. I always thought this was done for poetic effect, but maybe someone can enlighten me.\n\n16) Not history, but speaking French is still pretty cool in most of Canada.\n\n17) No problem there. But I might mention it's not just Canada that does this. It's the entire English-speaking world outside of the US. If anything, it's Americans that are the weird ones.\n\n18) The Queen of England is not our head of state. The [Queen of Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy_of_Canada) is our [head of state](https://www.google.ca/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=head%20of%20state%20of%20canada). It just so happens that she is the same person.\n\n19) Not history. True-ish.\n\n20) Generalizations. Google \"Churchill MB Polar Bear Attacks\".\n\n21) This is true.\n\n22) \n\n&gt;Besides, our national sport is not hockey, its lacrosse. It's one of the few sports that originated on the North American continent, it was played by the Aboriginals.\n\nHockey is indeed our national sport. In 1994, Parliament passed a law declaring [hockey as our national winter sport and lacrosse as our national summer sport.](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/n-16.7/page-1.html) Prior to that law, hockey was our national pastime and lacrosse our national sport.\n\n23)\n\n&gt;We didn't invent hockey, we just made it better. \n\nKinda true. Hockey, like baseball, evolved from a number of stick-and-ball games played in Europe. The [first indoor game was played in Montreal in 1875](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_indoor_hockey_game), and followed field hockey rules. It wasn't until 1893 that the first US collegiate teams were formed, and they followed rules developed in Canada. Whether we \"made it better\" is entirely subjective. Ice-polo might have been a really fantastic game for all you know.\n\n24) We haven't had a Stanley Cup winner in over 20 years. We'll take credit wherever we can.\n\n25) Seems likely.\n\n26) How many times have you actually been asked this question?\n\n27) \n\n&gt;We have no right to keep and bear arms.\n\nTrue. The Supreme Court of Canada decided in 1993 that [Canadians do not have a constitutionally protected right to own firearms](http://ualawccsprod.srv.ualberta.ca/ccs/index.php/constitutional-issues/25-other/73-ontario-court-confirms-no-right-to-bear-arms-in-canada-supreme-court-will-not-hear-appeal). The rest of that statement is just pure hyperbole.\n\n28) True, but the debate on whether the border is truly \"undefended\" may be a subject for another sub.\n\n29) Completely subjective. [And a quick google search for \"New York Niagara Falls\"](https://www.google.ca/search?q=new+york+niagara+falls&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1252&amp;bih=651&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CAYQ_AUoAWoVChMI7ZzAubPUyAIVwZiICh0WHgjj) proves you wrong on the second point. \n\n30) \n\n&gt;We own the North Pole, and therefore Santa Claus is Canadian.\n\nOh wow is there a /r/badgeopolitics sub?\n\n31) Not history, but mostly true, but the blanket term \"Eskimo\" applies to both the Inuit and Yupik people. However, there are no Yupik in Canada that I know of. \n\n32) Not history. Pretty much true, though.\n\n33) There were only 32 items on this list so there's one for /r/badmath.\n\nEDIT: [I've posted this on /r/badeverything as well with more in-depth analysis of the non-historical points.](https://www.reddit.com/r/BadEverything/comments/3por9e/33_mostly_erroneous_things_americans_should_know/)",

        "text": "[Source](https://np.reddit.com/r/history/comments/3pj71q/did_the_southeastern_asian_civilizations_ever/cw7ctjs)\n\n&gt; There are basically two groups of Southeast Asians. \n\nThis is not true in any meaningful way. From an ethnic perspective Southeast Asia clearly contains much more than just two groups; [the government of Vietnam alone recognizes 54 different ethnicities.](http://cema.gov.vn/wps/portal/cema/ethnic/)^1 From a linguistic perspective Southeast Asia is [quite diverse](http://www.muturzikin.com/cartesasiesudest/imagesasiesudest/sudest.png), incorporating Sino-Tibetan languages (such as Burman), Austroasiatic languages (such as Vietnamese), Tai-Kadai languages (such as Thai), Hmong-Mien languages (such as Hmong), and Austronesian languages (such as Malay). You might be able to argue for a divide between \"Indicized\" and \"Sinicized\" peoples, but then there are peoples who have incorporated both Indian and Chinese elements and [peoples who have adopted no significant parts of either](http://www.academia.edu/3982694/Regional_hunter-gatherer_traditions_in_South_East_Asia), and the arrival and adoption of Islam also throws a wrench in this scheme. \n\n&gt; The Polynesians and the Formosans (Also the Aboriginals, but they made less of an impact)\n\nThe Formosans are the aboriginal people of Taiwan, the Polynesians are the (aboriginal) people of Polynesia. Neither Taiwan nor Polynesia is located in Southeast Asia. It is true that [the Austronesian languages](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0a/Migraciones_austronesias.png) that are widespread throughout maritime Southeast Asia (Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines) [appear to have originated in Taiwan,](http://www.ling.sinica.edu.tw/files/publication/j2008_3_03_2983.pdf) and perhaps from mainland China before Taiwan, but that does not mean that Austronesian speakers are Formosan any more than the Kurgan theory means that Indo-European speakers are all Ukrainian. The Polynesians are Austronesian speakers who spread east across Oceania in the past few thousand years, and [considering the location of Polynesia](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/93/Pacific_Culture_Areas.jpg) the Polynesians have not had anything to do with Southeast Asia.\n\n&gt; The first great seafarers of the world were Polynesians. \n\nThis is a subjective, rather than false, statement, so I can't really call it bad history. It's also true that the Polynesians were extremely impressive mariners, sailing thousands of kilometers to reach the remotest islands such as New Zealand, Easter, or Hawaii, so I'll give OP the benefit of the doubt and assume they realize that [there were sea voyagers far, far before the Polynesians.](https://genographic.nationalgeographic.com/migration-to-australia/)\n\n&gt; After colonising Southeast Asia (SEA)\n\nThe Polynesians did not colonize Southeast Asia. [In fact, the Austronesian expansion generally moves east into Oceania, *from* Southeast Asia and Melanesia into Polynesia](http://press.anu.edu.au/austronesians/austronesians/mobile_devices/ch05s02.html) ([referring back to this map](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0a/Migraciones_austronesias.png)). It would be more correct to argue that Southeast Asians colonized Polynesia.\n\n&gt; they went on the colonise the rest of the Pacific.\n\nThis is mostly true, although they did not colonize *all* of the rest of the Pacific, or even all of Oceania. For example, there were no Polynesians in Queensland, California, or Tierra del Fuego, although all three places border the Pacific (to be fair, now [there are up to 300,000 Pacific Islanders in California](http://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/briefs/c2010br-12.pdf) and [70,000 Pacific Islanders - particularly Maori - in Queensland](https://www.health.qld.gov.au/multicultural/health_workers/pac-island-pop.asp), so I suppose you could argue that Polynesians *have* recently colonized California and Queensland). The majority of Oceania is Australia, and [although Austronesian speakers did historically voyage to northeastern Australia,](http://press.anu.edu.au//apps/bookworm/view/Macassan+History+and+Heritage/10541/ch01.xhtml) they were not Polynesians but Muslim Macassans from Sulawesi, Indonesia, and they traded more than colonized.\n\n&gt; Some people even claim they landed in the Americas before anyone else (on their little catamarans which they invented).\n\nThere is an academic theory that the Polynesians landed in the Americas before Columbus did, based on [the sweet potato, an American crop, which reached Polynesia](http://www.pnas.org/content/110/6/2205) (and Polynesian words for it which are similar to South American words for the sweet potato, such as Quechua *kumar* and Maori *kūmara*), genetics on [both](http://www.pnas.org/content/110/16/6465.short) [sides](http://www.cell.com/current-biology/abstract/S0960-9822(14\\)01220-2?_returnURL=http%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0960982214012202%3Fshowall%3Dtrue), [possible pre-Columbian chicken bones](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030544030800201X), and other things. The theory still remains disputed. But everyone agrees the Polynesians who found South America (if they did) ran into an inhabited continent, and that they did not discover it before the native Americans did. After all, the Austronesian migrations and expansions begin millenniums after [South America was first inhabited](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Verde), and even though the Polynesians were great navigators \"their little catamarans\" couldn't travel back in time. \n\n&gt; The Maoris of NZ are part of this group.\n\nThis is correct.\n\n&gt; They were warriors and were constantly at war with each other.\n\nThere is much cultural diversity between Polynesian peoples, even though they mostly diverged relatively recently. So while many Polynesian people had a fierce warrior culture, not all did. In fact, one people - the Moriori of the Chatham Islands - were notable for [their Nunuku's Law, which prohibited warfare](http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/moriori/page-2) (they are also notable for [what happened when two Maori *iwi* arrived in Moriori land](http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/moriori/page-4)).\n \n\n&gt; Today, most SEA's are descended from Formosan (basically from Taiwan).\n\n[Virtually all Southeast Asians, and virtually all humans, are also descended from Iry-Hor the pharaoh, so this doesn't mean much.](http://tedlab.mit.edu/~dr/Papers/Rohde-MRCA-two.pdf) Nevertheless it does seem to be the case that the majority of Southeast Asians live in Austronesian-dominated states (Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines), so let's give OP the benefit of the doubt.\n\n&gt; They too were good seafarers\n\nThe Taiwanese Aborigines, to my knowledge, were not particularly notable seafarers, although their distant cousins - Austronesian speakers in other places - often were. \n\n&gt; founded the spice route.\n\nTthe Indian Ocean and Southeast Asian trade routes were not solely founded nor used by Austronesian speakers. The [Indo-European-speaking Romans](https://legacy.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/periplus.asp) (and later other southern Europeans such as Venetians), [Indo-European-speaking Persians or the Afro-Asiatic-speaking Arabs](http://cnqzu.com/library/To%20Organize/Books/Brill%20Ebooks/Brill._Handbook_of_Oriental_Studies/Brill.%20Handbook%20of%20Oriental%20Studies/Classic_Ships_of_Islam__From_Mesopotamia_to_the_Indian_Ocean__Handbook_of_Oriental_Studies_Handbuch_Der_Orientalistik_.pdf), [Niger-Congo-speaking Swahili](https://journals.lib.byu.edu/spc/index.php/CCR/article/viewFile/12798/12663), [the Indo-European or Dravidian-speaking Indians](https://muse.jhu.edu/books/9789812309389), [the Sino-Tibetan-speaking Chinese](http://www.jstor.org/stable/41493537), and even isolate-speaking [Koreans](http://seamission.net/jboard/download.php?board=bbs&amp;filename=%C7%D1%B1%B9%C5%C2%B1%B9-%B4%EB%B5%BF%B9%AE%C8%AD(%C3%D6%C1%BE%BA%BB\\).pdf) and [Japanese](http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1xwc44) got in the act. Although Austronesian speakers were a major component, they were hardly the sole people trading in the Indian.\n\n&gt; The spice route was in existence thousands of years before Europeans discovered it. This route allowed them to travel all the way to Kenya in the West and Japan in the East. Unfortunately, the spice route brought many foreign powers greedy for power and wealth to the region. \n\nThis is true.\n\n&gt; Larger civilisations like India and China have been using nations in SEA as buffer states for at least a thousand years. \n\nNot quite. Although India and China have profoundly affected Southeast Asia, [a buffer state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffer_state) is a state \"lying between two rivals.\" There was no meaningful rival of China to its south (especially compared to the danger posed by the nomadic peoples north of China) and there was no significant rival of \"India\" to its east. Burma may have been influenced by Indian culture, but it was not a *buffer* for India; same for China and Vietnam.\n\n&gt; Later the Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch and English divided the region amongst themselves.\n\nTrue, although it's worth pointing out that Siam/Thiland was not truly colonized, although [it did lose significant territory](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/45/Siam_territoral_losses.gif) during the process of European expansion in Indochina (particularly Laos in 1893, which had been under Siamese rule since Taksin the Great in the late 18th century), and that eastern Indochina - Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos - was under French rule/protectorate. Much of what I would consider Southeast Asia is also now governed from Beijing. [Here's a neat map.](http://rozenbergquarterly.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/colonia_sphere_se_asia.png) And the most minor of nitpicks, London's imperialism in Southeast Asia really began when it was the capital of Great Britain, not England; Penang was ceded in 1786, Singapore was founded in 1819, and the first Anglo-Burmese War began in 1824, whereas \"England\" had been part of Great Britain since 1707. \n\n---\n\n^1 The link is from the Vietnamese government's Committee for Ethnic Minority Affairs site, but nevertheless it is inaccurate. For instance, it is objectively false that the Cham and the Kinh \n(aka the Vietnamese) have been \"living together in one country from time immemorial\" even if we take \"time immemorial\" to mean \"since the beginning of recorded history,\" especially considering that there have been several major wars between the Cham and the Kinh, culminating in the sack and conquest of Vijaya in 1471 by the Kinh state of Dai Viet and eventually leading to the total annexation of the last Cham state of Panduranga in 1832 (and the suppression of a few Cham revolts the following years). Vietnam was significantly smaller in previous centuries; [here's a map of the *Namtien*, the southern conquests of the Kinh state.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/84/Nam_Tien.PNG)",

It shouldn't be that surprising coming from a person who in the past has claimed to have memories of British soldiers from his youth in the British Mandate of Palestine, even though he was born after the mandate expired and the last British soldier left the land, but other than the disturbing idea that Hitler did nothing wrong and that Palestinians are not just current, but mortal enemies of the Jewish people, this claim is pretty much entirely unfounded. \n\nWhile it is true that al-Husseini was in close contact with the Axis powers during the war and was enthusiastic of the idea of getting rid of the Jews, the final solution was organized entirely independent of him, during the Wansee conference in 1942. Al-Husseini had nothing to do with that, and it's pretty ridiculous to assume that such a major part of Nazi racial policy was determined actually by a foreigner. \n\nThe only connection to anything of the sort by al-Husseini is [this](http://www.yadvashem.org/odot_pdf/Microsoft%20Word%20-%201247.pdf) article about Husseini (in Hebrew), from the Israeli Holocaust museum, Yad Vashem (a very reliable source). It mentions two cases in which he intercepted attempts by the Jewish Agency to save 4,000 and 5,000 Jews, respectively, by providing the Third Reich with necessary truck equipment in return for the shipment of those Jews to British-held Palestine. Husseini convinced the Germans not to accept the deal and instead send those Jews to extermination. However, there are several points to be made that show this is essentially irrelevant to Mr. Netanyahu's claim:\n\n1. This happened after the Wansee Conference, meaning irrelevant to the final solution itself.\n\n2. Those are only two separate cases, of a sum of 9,000 Jews out of 6,000,000 who perished. \n\n3. Those were Jews who were designated for extermination anyway, Husseini intercepted an attempt to save them, but he never had to convince anyone to exterminate them in the first place. \n\nSo Netanyahu's claim is entirely irrelevant to the Yad Vashem source. They claim two very distinct things, that are almost mutually-exclusive. Nowhere else in that source does it mention anything of the sort of Hitler being convinced away from the position of expulsion by Husseini, so the prime minister's claim is just unfounded.\n\nEDIT: I've heard today, surrounding this claim by the PM, that there is another source, someone who was supposedly Eichmann's secretary or something, who claimed that exact same claim as the PM. I can't find any sources for that because I don't remember any of the specifics, but it seems that it isn't true anyway because it is one single mostly irrelevant source that is probably just trying to whitewash Germans.\n\nIt has also been pointed out in the comments, rightly, that not only was the Final Solution being organized before the Mufti had any chance to convince Hitler of anything, but that long before that there were Einsetsgruppen already in operation, indicating that Hitler did not want to merely expel the Jews but was, indeed, planning a 'race war' that involved killing as many Jews as possible, the only questions were how, where, when, and by whom exactly, but not whether.",

New York didn’t emancipate until 1799, New Jersey until 1804. It’s not like the North went full frontal freedom after the revolution. It took awhile. \n\n&gt;[Why was the US unique in having massive slave reproduction?](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/3pcfaz/ama_the_atlantic_slave_trade_especially_human/cw5akgx)\n\nThis one was more egregious. \n\n&gt;[One factor is that plantation owners in the big sugar-producing colonies preferred male slaves, so the skewed sex ratio limited reproduction](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/3pcfaz/ama_the_atlantic_slave_trade_especially_human/cw5mltg)\n\nThis just isn’t right. It’s true that prior to the end of the trade that the Planters preferred to buy “salt water” males. But the ratio in Jamaica for example was 60/40, and just because the planters preferred to buy males, doesn’t mean they got to keep the ratio of males they bought.  They died. Male slaves weren’t as tough in surviving the seasoning period as the females, although they were stronger. And in Jamaica, both pre and post end of the trade the male female ratio was about at parity. And even the 60/40 ratio for purchase isn’t enough to explain the low birth rate. The birth rate was notably low on the islands before the end of the slave trade. The planters didn’t encourage breeding. They wanted their female slaves for field work. Women were better in the great gangs for the work of cutting the canes and harvesting.  Both of the following citations are from Kenneth Morgan’s Slave Women and Reproduction in Jamaica, c.1776–1834, in History Volume 91, Issue 302, pages 231–253, April 2006\n\n&gt;In the British West Indies, women outnumbered men in the ‘great gang’ that carried out the most strenuous tasks of cane holing, planting and harvesting sugar, all under enormous pressures of time. In a sample of four Caribbean slave societies in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries – Barbados, Martinique, Jamaica, Cuba – women outnumbered men in the fields. (Page 237)\n\n\n\nAnd it was known that breeding was and had been discouraged because \n\n&gt;Planters calculated the costs of purchasing adult and adolescent Africans as opposed to rearing children themselves and concluded that they would not encourage their seasoned women slaves to breed ‘as thereby so much work is lost in their attendance upon their infants (Page 232)\n\n\n\nSo the Planters bought more males when they could, and the women had a higher survival rate. What didn’t get answered is why was the birth rate so low in comparison to the mainland. The real answer is we don’t really know. We suspect a number of factors. Again from the same article by Morgan \n\n&gt;Historians have pointed to several possible reasons for these poor reproductive rates among British West Indian slaves in the final decades of slavery. One line of interpretation emphasizes the poor nutritional state of slaves, heavy infant mortality, strenuous working demands imposed by sugar cultivation, and the brutality of the overseer’s whip. Dietary deficiencies in protein and calcium, the high incidence of deaths among infants, the severity of the gang system on plantations, and the underlying discipline imposed by white estate personnel on slaves are essential parts of this explanation. The exact relationship between these factors, however, is recognized as difficult to determine. (Page 234. )\n\n\n\nSo the skewed sex ratio didn’t exist. That it limited reproduction is incorrect. There was no skewed sex ratio in population, primarily  because of higher male mortality, and on islands were the women outnumbered the men, such as Barbados, the birth rate was higher. \n\n\n\nAnswering this\n\n&gt;[I have heard it said that the majority of slave traders were Jewish and that the majority of slaves ended up in south America.

The vast majority of slave traders were Christians.I've seen evidence of a few Jews involved in the slave trade, but not many, and they were usually in marginal roles. For instance, I've found letters in which British slave traders in Jamaica mention selling a few slaves to Jews who planned to smuggle the slaves into Spanish America. But the simple fact that the traders mentioned it implied that they found it unusual.](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/3pcfaz/ama_the_atlantic_slave_trade_especially_human/cw5j68i)\n\n\n\nThis might be some sort of political football in the US. In Europe, [in Israel](http://www.i24news.tv/en/news/international/europe/131231-dutch-rabbi-jews-were-deeply-involved-in-slave-trade), and in Europe, in [the Netherlands as an example]( http://forward.com/culture/art/310222/jewish-slavery-caribbean-exhibition/), it is not a huge issue. When the Portuguese and the Spanish expelled their Jews, the Iberians’ loss was a Dutch gain, many Jews found shelter either in the Netherlands, or overseas in Brazil and Surinam. And the Jews were extremely active in the Slave trade in Dutch overseas territories. The Dutch held naval and a degree of economic superiority in the Caribbean in the 17th century and they continued to be a force in the face of a rising Britain in the 18th century, and they were one of the biggest if not the biggest merchants of slaves in the settlement of the Caribbean, and a good portion of their slave traders and holders on Curacao and over in Recife, then Pernambuco, were Jewish. Jewish Hollanders in the Caribbean and South America did a great deal of business with the DWIC.  That’s pretty awful. But it isn’t even vaguely socially unacceptable until the beginning of 19th century. It’s not anti-semitic to note it as a historical occurrence, as Jewish publications, rabbis and scholars have no issue noting it, and it’s not a particular big deal in U.S. American History because it doesn’t impact North America.   But it happened and the numbers of people traded and people trading, are not small. That's not anti-semitism. It's just history. \n\n\n\n&gt;[What accounts for the difference in philosophies towards slavery between the Spanish and the British or French, whose colonies apparently did not afford slaves similar rights?](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/3pcfaz/ama_the_atlantic_slave_trade_especially_human/cw5877y)\n\nThis answer: \n\n&gt;[The short answer to this is that the Catholic Church made some interventions to force reforms of slavery in the Spanish Empire. -On the flip-side Catholic religious orders were some of the biggest slaveholders in Spanish America.- The coartación laws are very interesting. They did offer a path to freedom for many industrious enslaved people, but it's also important to remember that only enslaved people who had a way to make money could take advantage of this opportunity to \"buy themselves.\" This was much more possible for people working in urban areas than for people toiling on plantations.](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/3pcfaz/ama_the_atlantic_slave_trade_especially_human/cw5fmvm)\n\n\n\nIgnores or downplays both Tannenbaum’s 1947 *Slave and Citizen*, and Kristen Block’s 2012 *Ordinary Lives in the Early Caribbean: Religion, Colonial Competition, and the Politics of Profit*. There are huge differences in the slave systems of the South American and North American and Caribbean Colonies. The powers of the inquisition vis a vis slaves and transferring their ownership, and the reforms, which weren’t slight, and sometimes also weren’t followed. The definitive difference in legal standing of owned slaves in South America. Their personhood. The relationship of marriage as a sacrament and a legal bond.  Both of these books lay those differences out in different ways, old and new. \n\n\n\nThis one \n\n&gt;[Hopefully I'm not too late, but - immediately after emancipation, what happened to slaves that had been owned by very wealthy / upper class families and had a better quality of life than most slaves, having learned to read and write etc?](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/3pcfaz/ama_the_atlantic_slave_trade_especially_human/cw5jwvr)\n\n\n\nGot to me a bit with the answer \n\n\n\n&gt;[Newly freed people had to take advantage of whatever skills they had after emancipation. While freedom was certainly preferable to slavery, it did leave many formerly enslaved people vulnerable since they were not given land or any other compensation for their years of service. **(In fact, in the British Empire slaveholders were compensated for their lost \"property,\" while the former slaves were turned loose with nothing but the close on their backs.)**](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/3pcfaz/ama_the_atlantic_slave_trade_especially_human/cw5prfl)\n\nThis isn’t even remotely true.The truth is worse. The British slaves that were “emancipated” weren’t turned loose. They had to stay and serve an “apprenticeship”  with their “former” masters who now got their work same as before without having to feed them as before or house them to the same standard they were at before. This in addition to not having to pay them. This was what happened before they were really freed. In some ways it would have been better had they just been able to go. They were “free” but had to stay with the same planters who had enslaved them for generations and work as “free” but indentured “apprentices.” \n\n\n\nLastly, this question \n\n&gt;[Do you know what percentage of white inhabitants here in Barbados would have been slaveowners throughout the history of the colony until 1834? I'm under the impression that it would be the majority.Also, did the Barbados Slave Code of 1661 make things better, or worse, for the enslaved, and how much did it influence the practice in the rest of the Americas?](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/3pcfaz/ama_the_atlantic_slave_trade_especially_human/cw5lh7j)\n\n\n\nAnd this part of the answer \n\n&gt;[As for the slave code of 1661, I think it was an important part of a gradual process of making slavery more rigid. And it was terribly influential on other British colonies. Barbados was the first British colony to adopt slavery on a large scale, so it set many important precedents. Several colonies copied laws from Barbados verbatim or with only slight modifications.](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/3pcfaz/ama_the_atlantic_slave_trade_especially_human/cw5q0us)\n\nThe 1661 slave code of Barbados was certainly probably taken by Governor Modyford to Jamaica, and they used it to make their own code, which resembled Barbados’ identically, at first. But by 1664 the Jamaicans had split their codes concerning servants and slaves into two completely separate works and then in 1684 the the Jamaicans made a number of innovations to their code and it’s the Jamaican code of 1684 that was very influential in the Caribbean and especially on the mainland in South Carolina. Here from Rugemer (2013), The Development of Mastery and Race in the Comprehensive Slave Codes of the Greater Caribbean during the Seventeenth Century. In The William and Mary Quarterly 70 (3), P. 429\n\n\n\n&gt; Dunn was probably correct about the contents of Modyford’s trove of papers for his voyage to Jamaica and there is no question about Jamaica’s adoption of the Barbadian Slave Act of 1661 (though the Jamaicans did change a few words). But there was another comprehensive Slave Act that historians have missed. In 1684, motivated by continued slave resistance and an order from Whitehall to revisit its laws, the Jamaica Assembly passed a new Slave Act. Jamaican legislators made significant innovations and when the South Carolina Assembly passed its own slave code in 1691, they did not look to Barbados, rather, they copied the Jamaica Act of 1684 almost word for word. Indeed, South Carolinians adopted none of the five new provisions added to the Barbadian slave code in 1688 \n\n\n\nIt’s not a bad AMA overall.  There are a number of answers that weren’t incorrect but it's no A+. But it has to be said, that on some of the more interesting questions the answers were not at all sound and not subjectively either. As I said, it's bad history because of inaccuracy and omission. Obviously, as a Wiedergutmachung, it's an AMA and the Prof. answered a lot of questions, and those are hard work, and you have to answer fast and he was tired at the end. So that is obviously a factor as well. All links are np. Cheers.\n\n",

        "text": "Real quick, I know this is post Cold War history, but since Rule 2 specifically says it disallows post Cold War *political* posts, I'm going in anyway.\n\nI was doing some small Google searching on Bartle's Taxonomy when I found this^1 gem that irked me beyond belief.\n\n&gt;And that's where the theory comes short, after 20 years, more and more \"categories\" of gamers have emerged. It was formulated before there was even competitive play in video games.\n\nBartle's Taxonomy, originally comes from Richard Bartle's paper *Hearts, Clubs, Diamonds, Spades: Players Who Suit MUDs*^2, published in 1996. This is already 24 years after the release of PONG^3, which is mainly a PvP (Player versus Player, as opposed to PvE, Player versus Environment) game, not to mention the centuries of Chess, Go, Checkers, and other classic board games that came before it. While he does specifically say video games, modern competition in video games is just a continuation of the millennia of sports and board games we've had throughout civilization. There is next to nothing fundamentally different about competitive video games, so I'm throwing those in there as well.\n\nGiving him the benefit of the doubt, though, let’s assume he means what most of us know as eSports (yes, I know not everyone loves that term, but it's what I'm using for now). There are four big scenes in eSports right now, MOBAs (by far the biggest), RTSs (which technically encompass MOBAs, but I'm keeping them separate for now), FPSs (360 no scope!), and Fighters (my specialty).\n\neSports as we know it today started hitting the mainstream around 2002 when Starcraft blew up in South Korea. The debut of Starcraft on the world stage was at World Cyber Games, which itself started in 2000^4. Ok, so that's after 1996, but when did Starcraft come out? Again, after 1996 in 1998^5. But what about the other RTS at WCG ‘00? Age of Empires II was also at WCG. Unfortunately this IGN article^6 (they used to be good, honest!) says it was released in October of 1999. So that's the RTSs out of the way. Let's move on to the MOBAs.\n\nMOBAs, while the most popular right now, are actually incredibly new. The first one was Defense of the Ancients, aka DOTA. The two most played right now are League of Legends, aka LoL, and DOTA 2. DOTA 2 is pretty much DOTA, but 2, and League is also DOTA, but 2. Basically the team split and made two separate games (and that is entire other topic in itself that I'm not going over here). So lets look at their main root, DOTA. DOTA was a Warcraft 3 Mod^7 (this is probably my worst source by far), and Warcraft 3 came out in 2002^8. Well crap. Ok, time to move on!\n\nAlright, FPS time. As all the scared parents would have you know, people were playing FPSs competitively ever since they could, and what more American way can you celebrate guns and violence than killing Nazis? Wolfenstein 3D is considered the first of the FPSs by most, although it was actually preceded by the first ever 3D multiplayer game, Spasim^9. While it wasn’t the first, let’s just go to Wolfenstein. Actually, let’s go to the one you’re actually thinking of, DOOM. Who hasn’t heard of DOOM? That game was so popular that it is cited as the true start of the genre, and not only that genre, but what many consider to be the quintessential Western video game genre^10 (as opposed to the quintessential Eastern genre, the jRPG). DOOM came out in 1993^11, 3 years before Bartle’s paper. Alright, we got a match! But let’s keep going anyway.\n\nFighting Games have a much more ambiguous past. It’s a blurry line between when Beat ‘em Ups like Double Dragon became Fighting Games, so let’s just get to the point. Just like you were thinking of DOOM for FPS, for Fighting Games, you are almost assuredly thinking of Street Fighter, specifically Street Fighter 2 (we don’t talk about 1). Street Fighter 2 was a huge hit, and it’s so loved that it still sees main stage play at some major tournaments. So when did SF2 come out? February 1991^12, before both DOOM and Wolfenstein 3D, and about 5 years before Bartle’s paper.\n\nBut let’s get to the true core of the statement. When he said that Bartle’s Taxonomy came out, it was before Bartle, and by extension the industry, knew about in depth competitive play. Granted, there is evidence that Bartle only really knew of PvP in a Club’s or Killer’s context, when it is obvious if you go to any major event or community that PvP also attracts the other 3 core types in other ways, but without any sources, dates, or in depth explanations, I believe that I can quite easily say, that that quote just dumb.\n\nSources:\n\n1 - http://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/articles/bartles-taxonomy-of-player-types-and-why-it-doesnt-apply-to-everything--gamedev-4173 - The Bad History (last comment on the page, currently)\n\n2 - http://mud.co.uk/richard/hcds.htm - Hearts, Clubs, Diamonds, Spades: Players Who Suit MUDs\n\n3 - http://www.atarigames.com/atarinumbers90s.pdf - Atari productions sheet\n\n4 - http://web.archive.org/web/20010827042022/http://www.worldcybergames.org/challenge/summary.asp - World Cyber Games 2000\n\n5 - http://web.archive.org/web/20080402134120/http://www.blizzard.com/us/press/10-years-starcraft.html - Starcraft 1 release date\n\n6 - http://www.ign.com/articles/1999/05/14/age-of-empires-ii-the-age-of-kings-2 - Age of Empires 2 release date\n\n7 - http://www.wikihow.com/Install-DoTA - Installing DOTA 1\n\n8 - http://www.ign.com/games/warcraft-iii-reign-of-chaos/pc-12906 - Warcraft 3 release date\n\n9 - http://web.archive.org/web/20010410145350/http://www.geocities.com/jim_bowery/spasim.html - Spasim Challenge\n\n10 - https://youtu.be/os3lWIuGsXE - Why the FPS is THE western genre (caution, there’s probably some bad history in here, as well)\n\n11 - http://web.archive.org/web/20120825053443/http://www.rome.ro/lee_killough/history/doompr3.shtml - DOOM press release\n\n12 - http://www.arcade-history.com/?page=detail&amp;id=2657 - Street Fighter 2 arcade release\n",

        "text": "As a hockey fan, I believe it to be important to assess one of the great works of slightly bad history from the recent past.  And by that, I mean Disney's much-lauded 2004 film \"Miracle\", about the 1980 United States Olympic team.\n\nThe story of the scrappy college kids beating the pseudo-amateur Soviet Union during the height of the Cold War is widely known, so I won't go into any substantial detail.  This focuses not on the general story, but simply on the movie.\n\n**0:00:15 to 0:03:21** We're treated first to an opening montage of various moments from the 1970s, from turbulent campus movements to the resignation of Richard Nixon to the debut of new gadgets.  This is well-done, and a nice touch.\n\n**0:03:21 to 0:03:54** We're then taken to a scene in the modern day (1979, presumably) at USA Hockey headquarters, where a cheery secretary answers a phone with the greeting \"USA Hockey, please hold.\"  So we're off to a roaring start.\n\nThe governing body of American hockey at the time was a group called the Amateur Hockey Association of the United States (AHAUS).  There had been ferocious fights over the years between AHAUS and the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU), normally over whose chosen team would represent the United States hockey squad in the Olympics.  Things really boiled over in 1948, when both the AAU and AHAUS sent teams to the Olympics in St. Moritz, nearly causing the entire hockey event to be cancelled.  AHAUS, opposed by the pompous blowhard Avery Brundage, prevailed.  I could write plenty on Brundage, but will spare everyone.  Every major Olympic controversy for close to 50 years has his fingerprints all over it, usually on the wrong side.  Very short version: aristocratic snob decides that amateurism is the pinnacle of human achievement, but basically makes it mirror the \"noble savage\" garbage.\n\nAnyway, American hockey's governing body would continue to be known as AHAUS for another 40 years.  When \"Badger\" Bob Johnson was named executive director of AHAUS in 1987, \"one of his first acts was to get the organization to change the names from (AHAUS) to USA Hockey, a move his staff applauded.\"  Longtime hockey administrator Walter Bush said \"I know he was bothered once when he gave his business card to someone on an airplane and they thought AHAUS was a construction firm.\"  What exactly the secretary in 1979 would have used as her greeting when answering the phone is unknown, but it wouldn't have been \"USA Hockey\".  Hell, the outside shot of the building in the movie has both the AHAUS shield and wordmark.\n\n**0:03:54 to 0:08:45** University of Minnesota coach Herb Brooks (played by Kurt Russell) sits in for to interview for the unenviable job of leading the American Olympic team to another slaughter.  The interview is with the various movers and shakers of American hockey, which in Brooks' opinion doesn't go well.  Back at home, he tells his wife Patti (Patricia Clarkson) \"Ah, I'm not their guy.  The only reason they had me come out there was because two other coaches already said no.\"  The two coaches in question here are Bill Cleary, longtime coach of Harvard, and John MacInnes of Michigan Tech.  Cleary had been a member of the 1956 and 1960 Olympic teams as a player, winning a silver and a gold medal;  his coaching record was spotty to that point.  MacInnes had three national championships to his name, but was in poor health; he would die of diabetic complications in 1983.  Brooks was no slouch behind the bench, as he'd taken over the Minnesota Golden Gophers program in 1972-73 and had won three national championships in seven seasons.  This included the most recent one at the time that the interview took place.  Fun side note on Brooks and MacInnes: each deprived the other of three consecutive national championships.  Brooks' Gophers and MacInnes' Huskies faced off for the NCAA title in 1974, 1975, and 1976, with Minnesota winning the first and last and Michigan Tech taking the middle.  But this is a Hollywood movie, and Brooks gets the job!  Hooray!\n\n**0:08:45 to 0:09:55** Players are checking in for tryouts.  One player asks another why Joe Mullen isn't around, to which the answer is given that Mullen has signed an NHL contract for a sizable amount.  The chronology is wrong here; the tryout camps were held in March 1979 (before Brooks was actually hired as coach), and the final one was the National Sports Festival in July 1979.  Mullen didn't sign with the St. Louis Blues of the NHL until August 14; he had simply declined to participate in the Olympic process at all in anticipation of signing a pro contract.  The roster for the National Sports Festival can be [found here](https://jaysonhron.wordpress.com/2015/02/15/statistical-leaders-1979-national-sports-festival/).\n\n**0:09:55 to 0:17:50** The tryouts begin, Brooks and his assistant Craig Patrick (Noah Emmerich) discuss various things including Patrick's role, and so on.  To the gathered players, Patrick then announces the list of the 26 players who have made the final list, to be pared down to 20 in time for the Olympics.  After a brief speech by Brooks, he's accosted by Walter Bush (Sean McCann) in the parking lot, and they argue over who exactly is supposed to be picking the team.  There's no need to touch on this scene at all; this falls into the \"developing character\" role that you need in movies, rather than the \"developing character\" chores that my dad liked to assign me randomly.  Because giving a 15-year-old a shovel and blacktop patching with no training is REALLY a great character-builder, Dad!\n\n**0:17:50 to 0:20:08** Real strife is about to happen!  A few of the players are having pizza and beer at a nearby restaurant, and going through Coach Brooks' psychology test.  We would come to learn throughout the movie that a defiant goalie Jim Craig (played off-ice by Eddie Cahill, on-ice by former NHLer and Stanley Cup champion Bill Ranford) refused to take the test at all.  The reality is that Craig completed the test, but voiced his displeasure with the entire exercise to Brooks when he handed it in.  But the merits of a coach giving his players a psychology test isn't the only dissension that's taking place.  Over their pizza and beer, it's obvious that the Boston and Minnesota kids don't much care for each other.  Jack O'Callahan (Michael Mantenuto) states that the reason for his hatred is simple: he only wanted to play college hockey to win a title, and one of those Minnesota kids (Rob McClanahan, played by Nathan West) deprived him of it with a cheap shot in an NCAA tournament game.\n\nBut there's a problem!  This never happened.  During O'Callahan's career at Boston University, his Terriers and McClanahan's Minnesota Golden Gophers only played each other once in the tournament.  This was in 1976 in a national semifinal game, and Minnesota prevailed by a 4-2 score in one of the ugliest games in college hockey history.  But while O'Callahan was a freshman on BU's team, McClanahan was in his senior year of high school; he wouldn't join the Gophers until the next season.  The 1976 game saw a ten-minute brawl break out after an alleged spitting incident, and the end result was the ejection of Minnesota defenseman Terry Anderson and Boston forward Terry Meagher.  O'Callahan didn't figure into [the scoresheet](http://www.gophersports.com/blog/Minnesota%204%20Boston%20University%202.pdf) at all, whether by scoring or by being penalized.  In any case, O'Callahan would level McClanahan in a team practice shortly afterward (the next scene), resulting in a fight between the two; this never happened at all either.\n\n**0:27:22 to 0:32:49** Meanwhile, there's trouble at home for Coach Brooks; he's so intently focused on hockey that he's neglecting his family.  After an argument with wife Patti, in which she accuses him of chasing after \"something you didn't get\", Herb goes into his study and opens up a box of old memories.  It's then revealed (accurately) that Brooks was on the 1960 Olympic team as a player, and was the last one cut before the tournament.  His team then won the gold medal without him.  And although it's not part of the movie, he would watch the final game on TV with his father, who after the final buzzer looked at his proud but dejected son and said, \"Looks like they made the right choice.\"  In any case, Brooks is shown to be doing exactly this, chasing after what he didn't get.  And the underlying question of who the last player to be cut from this team would be is a recurring one that would be addressed repeatedly throughtout the rest of the movie.\n\n**0:32:50 to 0:46:55** More training scenes, complete with player names being peeled off of lockers as they're released.  This wasn't quite how it went; the 26 players went to Europe as part of [the team's exhibition tour](http://history.vintagemnhockey.com/page/show/1166356-1980-pre-olympic-tour-schedule-results).  But there's trouble on the horizon again.  In a listless game played against Team Norway, the Americans only manage a 3-3 tie.  A furious Brooks orders the team to stay on the ice after the handshakes, where they're subjected to brutal conditioning drills as punishment.  This did in fact happen; the game was played on September 17, 1979.  The way that it ended in the movie is different from real life, but again, I won't harp on cinematic license that's needed for developing character.  In real life, the Americans rebounded after their harsh treatment and destroyed Norway by a 9-0 score in a game played the very next night.\n\n**0:46:55 to 0:48:20** The next scene has Brooks (still on the road) talking to wife Patti after the plane was delayed due to hitting a moose on the runway in Thief River Falls, MN.  While in conversation, he sees a news broadcast that the dreaded Soviet team has beaten the NHL's best by a 6-0 score.  The red juggernaut is simply unstoppable by now.\n\nBut there's are two problems: *major* continuity issues.  The first series involving the USSR's best against NHL players was in 1972 with the incomparable eight-game Summit Series, and more events were scheduled over the ensuing years.  For the 1978-79 NHL season, the All-Star Game was replaced by the Challenge Cup, pitting the NHL's best against the USSR.  In the deciding Game 3, the Soviets did win by a 6-0 score.  But the game was played on February 11, 1979; Herb Brooks wasn't hired as the American coach until that summer, the tryouts were that spring and summer, the listless game against Norway was in September, and all of the events in the movie so far took place well after the Challenge Cup.  Every coach and player going *into* camp had already seen the 6-0 Soviet victory; this was nothing new.\n\nIn addition, the game in question was played in Warroad, MN, a stone's throw from the border with Manitoba.  Warroad is regarded as America's true Hockeytown (suck on that, Detroit), and the American Olympic team playing an exhibition against the Warroad Lakers senior league team was something of a tradition.  After the 10-0 win, the team plane couldn't take off from Warroad's small runway with the total weight, so team equipment manager Gary Smith had to unload all the equipment into a truck and drive to Thief River Falls, where the lightened plane coming from Warroad would land, be re-loaded, and then take off.  The game in Warroad was actually played in February 1980, the second-to-last exhibition game on the team schedule (the last one being against the Soviets in New York City.  More on that shortly.)  And the plane actually clipped a pole, not a moose.  [USA Hockey Magazine interviewed Smith; the article is here](http://www.usahockeymagazine.com/article/2011-10/big-smitty-and-miracles).\n\n**0:48:20 to 0:53:25** More film study and training.  We see the roster being pared down from 26 to 21; at 0:51:15 we see Craig Patrick crossing Jack Hughes' name off the list, and the strip of tape with his name above the locker being removed.  At 52:13 we see a strip of tape marked AUGE (Les Auge) being removed, then HORSCH (Bruce Horsch).  There is a continuity error here; when Hughes' name was crossed off the list, Auge's, Horsch's, and two other players (Gary Ross and Dave Delich) had already been crossed off.\n\n**0:53:25 to 1:11:02** Time passes.  Iranian revolutionaries take over the American embassy (November 1979), there's saber-rattling between the American and Soviet sides over whether to boycott Olympics, and then there's a Christmas party.  But in between all of this is the ever-present danger of being the last player cut.  This is accentuated when scoring forward Tim Harrer, who hasn't been with the team at any point, joins on.  This triggers a revolt by the players, who are obviously nervous about losing a roster spot to a hired gun.  We've already seen five of the six cuts happen by tape being removed: Gary Ross, Les Auge, Bruce Horsch, Dave Delich, and Jack Hughes.  One more to go.  And after a practice, it's revealed that Ralph Cox is the last player to be sent packing.\n\nIn reality, Cox had broken his ankle in the fall during the exhibition games and never really recovered to 100%.  His numbers during the exhibition slate when healthy were terrific, but he wasn't completely healthy.  Jack Hughes had impressed during the exhibitions, but would actually be the last player sent home.  He didn't receive so much as an extra representing him in the movie; the only times he was mentioned at all was once in training camp with the rest of the early cuts, and when the strip of tape with his name was removed off the locker early on.\n\n**1:11:02 to 1:16:39** We now resume the movie long enough to see the final exhibition, played just days before the opening ceremonies.  It's the American team against the Soviets, and it's not even close.  10 goals for the Big Red Machine, 3 goals for the overmatched college kids.  And Jack O'Callahan suffers a sprained knee in the process, but it's decided that he'll stay on the roster rather than be replaced.  As a simple aside unrelated to this movie but very much related to sports and health, a sprain is a stretch or partial tear of a ligament, a strain is something that involves a muscle or a tendon.  I constantly hear people refer to \"strained ligament\" or \"sprained muscle\" or \"sprained tendon\", none of which is accurate.  Don't feed into bad medicine, particularly bad sports medicine!\n\nNot featured in the movie, but very much part of real life, was Soviet coach Viktor Tikhonov making a couple of unkind remarks about the American team, including agreeing with a reporter who asked if the game could be considered \"practice\".\n\nOf course, I can't figure how many months after the plane-pushing scene in Thief River Falls this game was played; the reality is that it was mere days.\n\n**Side note** The hockey scenes throughout the movie are well-shot and are *generally* accurate; I won't harp on them for some relatively minor issues.  A bigger one, I would argue, is the complete exclusion in all ways of team goalie coach Warren Strelow.  He's not mentioned in the movie at all, he's not seen as an extra, he's not anywhere.  Strelow had grown up playing hockey with Herb Brooks, and they started coaching together at the University of Minnesota.  After the Olympics, he'd become one of the great goalie coaches in NHL history, starting off early in New Jersey with a young Martin Brodeur and then being a big part of the San Jose Sharks goalie pipeline.  When he died in 2007, the Sharks honored him with a [memorial patch on the left shoulder](http://nhlpatches.info/patches/SAN/san_was.htm).  Strelow was apparently good enough for the NHL and good enough for the Miracle on Ice, but not good enough for Disney.\n\n**1:14:47 to 1:14:52** Back to the movie.  After the game, one of the American officials (Lou Nanne, played by Bill Mondy) says to a reporter that \"This Soviet team has been together for ten years.  We got college kids still getting to know each other.\"  This has become the prevailing idea of what the Miracle On Ice is all about: the scrappy American college kids beating the shamateur Soviets.  And although it's partially true, it's not entirely true.\n\nThe final roster of 20 players included several professional players, and a lot of very highly-regarded college kids.  The list of these college players is:\n\n* **Mark Johnson (Wisconsin)** - taken in both the NHL and WHA drafts in 1977, turned pro after the Olympics with the Pittsburgh Penguins\n\n* **Rob McClanahan (Minnesota)** - a 3rd-round pick in the 1978 NHL draft, turned pro after the Olympics with the Buffalo Sabres\n\n* **Steve Christoff (Minnesota)** - a 2nd-round pick in the 1978 NHL draft, turned pro after the Olympics with the Minnesota North Stars\n\n* **Neal Broten (Minnesota)** - a 3rd-round pick in the 1979 NHL draft, turned pro after the Olympics with the Minnesota North Stars\n\n* **Dave Silk (Boston University)** - a 4th-round pick in the 1978 NHL draft, turned pro after the Olympics with the New York Rangers\n\n* **Dave Christian (North Dakota)** - a 2nd-round pick in the 1979 NHL draft, turned pro after the Olympics with the Winnipeg Jets\n\n* **Jack O'Callahan (Boston University)** - taken in both the NHL and WHA drafts in 1977.  His knee injury suffered during the exhibition against the Soviets kept him out the remainder of the 1979-80 season after the Olympics, but he turned pro for the next season.\n\n* **Mike Ramsey (Minnesota)** - a 1st-round pick (11th overall) in the 1979 NHL draft, turned pro after the Olympics with the Buffalo Sabres.  He would retire in 1997 after an NHL career that saw him play over 1,000 games.\n\n* **Bill Baker (Minnesota)** - taken in both the NHL and WHA drafts in 1976, turned pro in the Montreal Canadiens' system after the Olympics\n\n* **Jim Craig (Boston University)** - taken in both the NHL and WHA drafts in 1977, turned pro after the Olympics with the Atlanta Flames\n\n* **Eric Strobel (Minnesota)** - an 8th-round pick in the 1978 NHL draft, turned pro after the Olympics in the Buffalo Sabres' system.  Suffered a severe ankle injury and retired after the season. \n\n* **Phil Verchota (Minnesota)** - taken in both the NHL and WHA drafts in 1976; took the rest of the season off after the Olympics.  Played overseas the next year, then took another year off.  Retired in 1984.\n\n* **Mark Wells (Bowling Green)** - a 13th-round pick in the 1977 NHL draft, turned pro after the Olympics in the Montreal Canadiens' system\n\n* **Ken Morrow (Bowling Green)** - taken in both the NHL and WHA drafts in 1976, turned pro after the Olympics with the New York Islanders.  Was a key part of the Islanders' dynasty; Morrow was a Stanley Cup champion three months after Olympic gold, and would win three more ccnsecutive Stanley Cups with the team.  Until the NHL started sending players to the Olympics in 1998, Morrow was the only player to win both gold and a Stanley Cup in the same year; he remains the only American player to do so.\n\n* **Jack Hughes** and **Ralph Cox** were cut from the team before the Olympics; both turned pro shortly after being released.\n\nSilk (twice), O'Callahan, Ramsey, Janaszak, Strobel, and Christoff had all been named to the NCAA's All-Tournament team in the preceding years.  Several others, by which I mean \"basically everyone\", had been named at least all-conference if not All-American.\n\nIn an era where drafting American college players was uncommon, to have this many actual NHL prospects in one place was extremely unusual.  Christoff was the first college player taken in the 1978 draft, Ramsey not only the first in 1979, but also the first college player ever taken in the 1st round of an NHL draft.\n\nThere were a couple of afterthought college players as well:\n\n* **Mark Pavelich (Minnesota-Duluth)** was undrafted, and played a year in Switzerland after the Olympics.  When Craig Patrick and Herb Brooks took over the NHL's New York Rangers, Pavelich was signed and played five years with the team.\n\n* **Steve Janaszak (Minnesota)** was undrafted, but turned pro after the Olympics.  He would play two separate NHL stints: a single game with the Minnesota North Stars in the same year as the Olympic triumph, and two games with the Colorado Rockies in 1981-82.\n\nThere were a couple of professional players as well:\n\n* Team captain **Mike Eruzione**, who scored the winning goal against the Soviets, had been named the IHL's American rookie of the year in 1977-78; he had two years of professional experience with the Toledo Goaldiggers, and also spent part if the 1978-79 season with the Philadelphia Firebirds of the AHL.\n\n* **Buzz Schneider** had been taken in both the NHL and WHA drafts in 1974.  He played in the 1976 Olympics, then the ensuing three seasons professionally in both the minors and in the WHA.\n\n* **John \"Bah\" Harrington** was undrafted out of Minnesota-Duluth, and signed with the Oklahoma City Stars after finishing out his college career in 1978-79.  He'd play with the American national team in the 1982-83 season, and represent his country  in the Olympics again in 1984.\n\n* **Bob Suter** left the University of Wisconsin after the 1978-79 season to sign with the Tulsa Oilers of the CHL.  He had previously been taken in both the NHL and WHA drafts in 1977.\n\n* **Gary Ross, Dave Delich, Les Auge,** and **Bruce Horsch** were cut before the Olympics; all had professional experience before beginning the exhibition games with the national team.\n\nOut of the final breakdown, that's 14 NHL prospects who had yet to turn pro, 4 professional players, and 2 truly unheralded (one of whom, Janaszak, didn't play a minute in the actual Olympic tournament).\n\nBut then, this begs the other question: had the Soviet team been together for years?  Well...not quite.  The Soviet juggernaut of the 1972 Summit Series was mostly getting old, and the later juggernaut of the 1980s was still off on the horizon.  In some ways, 1980 was a little bit of a valley for Soviet hockey; the old guard was fading, the new guard wasn't quite there yet.  The old guard included:\n\n* **Boris Mikhailov**, 35 years old, 3rd Olympics plus 9 World Championships.  Had played on the Soviet team since the 1969 World Championships, participated in both the 1972 and 1974 Summit Series in addition to the 1979 Challenge Cup.\n\n* **Valeri Kharlamov**, 32 years old, 3rd Olympics plus 11 World Championships.  Joined the Soviet team the same year as Mikhailov (1969), participated in the 1972 and 1974 Summit Series, the 1979 Challenge Cup, and 11 Izvestia Cups.\n\n* **Alexander Maltsev**, 30 years old, 3rd Olympics plus 10 World Championships.  Joined the Soviet team in 1969, participated in the 1972 and 1974 Summit Series and the 1976 Canada Cup.\n\n* **Vladimir Petrov**, 32 years old, 3rd Olympics plus 9 World Championships.  Joined in 1969, Participated in the 1972 and 1974 Summit Series, and the 1979 Challenge Cup.\n\n* **Valeri Vasiliev**, 30 years old, 3rd Olympics plus 9 World Championships.  Joined in 1970, participated in the 1972 and 1974 Summit Series, the 1976 Canada Cup, and the 1979 Challenge Cup.\n\n* **Vladislav Tretiak**, 27 years old, 3rd Olympics plus 10 World Championships.  Joined in 1970 when he was just 18.  Participated (dominated) in the 1972 and 1974 Summit Series, 1976 Canada Cup, and 1979 Challenge Cup.\n\nIn hockey terms, Mikhailov would be the only \"old man\" of the roster, but these guys had a ton of mileage on them.  And of the younger guard, the ones playing in their first Olympics who had been on the Soviet team for less than five years included **Helmuts Balderis** (27, and the only Latvian player on the team), **Viacheslav Fetisov, Vasili Pervukhin, Alexander Skvortsov, Vladimir Golikov, Alexander Golikov, Zinetula Bilyaletdinov, Sergei Makarov**, and **Vladimir Myshkin**.  Players on the big team for the first time in a tournament were **Alexei Kasatonov, Vladimir Krutov**, and **Sergei Starikov**.  In between were **Yuri Lebedev** and **Viktor Zhluktov**, who had prior Olympic experience but weren't top players.\n\nNone of this diminishes the actual accomplishment in any way.  Yes, the Americans had NHL prospects, but that's what they were: prospects.  No Hall of Famers on the team, only a couple of All-Stars.  They were by and large depth players, and most had retired from playing within five years after the Olympic triumph.  The Soviet youngsters would form the backbone of the dominant force of international hockey in the 1980s, and the experience and skill of the older players was beyond reproach.  Tretiak had mileage on him, but he'd been a dominant goalie of the highest caliber since he was 18 years old (less than a decade prior) and still was dominant.  His backup Vladimir Myshkin was the one who shut out the NHL's best 6-0 to win the Challenge Cup, and was a terrific goalie himself.  And the Soviet system embodied the very ethos of \"individual creativity within a tight structure\".  And the same Soviet team had thoroughly pummeled the same American team 10-3 just a couple weeks prior.\n\nOutside of directly linked websites, I also leaned heavily on [hockeydb.com](http://www.hockeydb.com) and *USA Hockey: A Celebration of a Great Tradition* by Kevin Allen.",

        "text": "This is my first submission to the sub, so *yadda yadda* be gentle &lt;3\n\nNow, all this started out with a user asking the community of /r/NoStupidQuestions [wether or not the pope has to go through passport control](https://np.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/3o0guq/does_the_pope_have_to_go_through_passport_control/) (TL;DR he does not have to go through the normal ones at least), but it lead to some papal badhistory, which i (*suprise!*) am going to refute in this post. [According to another user this was one of the reasons to make vatican city a sovereign nation.](https://np.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/3o0guq/does_the_pope_have_to_go_through_passport_control/cvt81gf)\n\n&gt; No. In fact this is part of the purpose of making Vatican City a sovereign nation. It makes the Pope a head of state and thus allows him as an exception to normal passport and customs controls.\nHead of state exceptions are usually even stronger that diplomatic exceptions.\n\nI'm going to talk about the \"In fact this is part of the purpose of making Vatican City a sovereign nation.\"-part. [Because it's wrong.](http://orig03.deviantart.net/4a40/f/2012/065/c/8/moriarty___surprise_face___gif_by_talichibi-d4rwq08.gif)\n\nWhy is it wrong? Because the reasons for this were entirely different, and the process was a bit more complicated. Before there was vatican city, there were the [papal states](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/PapalStates1700.png/280px-PapalStates1700.png) which were under the sovereign rule of the pope. Unlike one may expect, the pope didn't rule from vatican back then, but rather from [lateran palace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lateran_Palace). Until the 14th centure when the vatican hill became the new seat of government because of various happy [little reasons](https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/2787458135/889540a40debce92b4c8015c4d7767a2_400x400.jpeg), which aren't that interesting right now.\n\nWe will kindly ignore the destruction of the papal states in 1798 and again in 1848 and fast forward until 1870 when King ~~Vittorio Emanuele Maria Alberto Eugenio Ferdinando Tommaso di Savoia~~ Vittorio Emanuele II. decided to use his [magnificient beard](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cd/Tranquillo_Cremona_-_Vittorio_Emanuele_II.jpg) and his troops to drive out the pope, and annex the remaining land of the papal states for the kingdom of italy.\n\nPope Pius IX. didn't appreciate this decision, as one may expect, declared that the loyalty was \"all a set of vipers, of whited sepulchres, and wanting in faith.\" and never recognized italian claims on rome. He even went so far to not even recognize the kingdom of italy. The troops of the (according to him) non-existent kingdom of italy weren't stopped by this, and Pius lost power over his earthly holdings, except vatican, lateran and the papal summer residence in [Castel Gandolfo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castel_Gandolfo).\n\nThis situation was known as the [roman question](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Question) and was only solved when the [Lateran Treaty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lateran_Treaty) was signed between the kingdom of italy under Benito Mussolini and the [Holy See](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9d/Roma-san_giovanni03.jpg) in 1929. Through these vatican city became a sovereign (and more importantly recognized) nation again, and even got a bit of money (1.75 million Lira) for it's birthday. In turn the pope recognized the kingdom of italy, ceded the former papal states territory and promised to not take sides in international affairs. [(I wonder why Mussolini wanted this)](http://www.artlinefilms.com/media/uploads/2012/11/Mussolini_image7.jpg) For all those who have been wondering the whole time: Yes, this is where i finally get to my point!\n\nNow it should seem pretty clear that both [Pope Pius XI.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cc/Papst_Pius_XI._1JS.jpg) and Benito Mussolini had completely different thoughts on their minds than saving the pope from having to go through passport controls. Vatican city was made sovereign to resolve the conflict between pope and italy that emerged when the papal states were ~~unindependended~~ annexed by the king of italy. I sincerely hope this is a sufficient refutation.\n\nFor those that want to learn more about the vatican city and the pope i recommend [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPHRIjI3hXs) video by CGPGrey (from which i blatantly stole the Hitler joke) about vatican city, as well as [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kF8I_r9XT7A) one about how even you dear ~~alcoholic~~ historian can become pope!",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/3p2853/the_tomb_of_two_manicurists_in_egypt_depict_a_gay/",
        "text": "I was reading some history online and came across [this](http://epistle.us/hbarticles/ancientegypt2.html) article.\n\nI enjoy reading about ancient Egypt, trying to get as well-rounded a perspective as I can based on what research has been done. Before I start I do have to say that I am *not* giving evidence of homophobia in Egypt; they were a very peaceful people and I'm not sure if they'd care about who did what with who. But they were not us, and they did not have gay rights activists trying to make a statement about their sexuality in oppressive times. That they definitely did not do; trying to say that the Tomb of Two Manicurists is about a gay couple in Egypt is similar to saying that reliefs describing the evisceration of animal-headed gods and feasting on the innards meant they often partook in cannibalism. I'm not saying homosexuality and cannibalism are the same, but I am trying to say that interpreting Egyptian reliefs is not as simple as saying “this one was literal and accurate, and this one was nonsense.” Each relief and Temple had a purpose, and there are peculiarities about this Temple at Saqqara which make me doubt that it is in homage to a gay couple.\n\nFirst off, [The Tomb of The Two Manicurists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khnumhotep_and_Niankhkhnum) is not a literal tomb, but a depiction of two ~~brothers~~ men doing activities together. [No one found a sarcophagus that held two mummified men lying next to each other](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/20/science/a-mystery-locked-in-timeless-embrace.html). Why they call it a tomb is beyond me; it was a Temple.\n\nSecond, in Egyptian, you will often find words that have similar phonemes but with different ideograms, which is similar to the way \"bus\" could be a verb for waiting tables, or a noun for a type of vehicle. Thus [Khnum](http://www.secretoftheankh.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Khnum.jpg) could easily refer to one of the neters of the Nile. Based on this, I'm willing to bet that, since these two men have Khnum in their name, that they were not actual men who had lived in Egypt and did what they did and were praised for doing it, but that they were representations of two different aspects of the god Khnum. You can even see them [hunting on the Nile](http://www.touregypt.net/images/touregypt/niankhnumt1.jpg) in the reliefs, further testament to their symbolic nature. The activities were not limited to hunting, but all were limited to the Nile.\n\nThis being said, let's look at the names: Niankhkhnum and Khnumhotep. These two essentially express \"Khnum in life (*n-'nx-xnm*, so literally *to-life-Khnum*)\" and \"Khnum at rest (*xnm-htp*),\" respectively. In the scene I linked, you can see both ~~brothers~~ men on the Nile, one hunting in the air and one hunting below water. Since one ~~brother~~ man is hunting *above the water* and the other *below the water*, one signifies some aspect of Nile life in vigor, and the other at rest. Exactly what the purpose of this is in relation to Egyptian life is uncertain, but we will explore that later.\n\nThirdly*:\n\n&gt;Both men are identified as hm (with the sense of “priest” here), and another inscription authorizes other priests (hm) to carry out their duties, while forbidding the men’s families from hindering them. The Egyptian hm derives from the common hieroglyph for “female,” but drops the feminine ending. This pictograph was used in a variety of senses, including “coward,” more generally “eunuch” (more in the sense of one being born a male biologically but having changed one’s gender, than being castrated), and commonly “priest” in tomb inscriptions.\n\nIt is true that *hm* translates to priest, but only if it has additional phonemes or ideograms attached referring to divinity, such as *hm-ntr* or *hm-k3*, which must have been the case for these two men if we are calling them priests. Egyptians also had many different hieroglyphs for male and female, but in particular, *hm* means slave, and adding the feminine ending *-t* simply meant female slave (maybe maid), or wife or girlfriend. So:\n\n&gt;Also, both of them being called hm (a gender-ambiguous term) would be more in keeping with a homoerotic bond than any of the other relationships suggested.\n\nand\n\n&gt;This pictograph was used in a variety of senses, including “coward,” more generally “eunuch” (more in the sense of one being born a male biologically but having changed one’s gender, than being castrated)...\n\n...are completely false. Words in Egyptian were predominantly male, unless a *-t* was in it. Egypt did not have words entrenched in gender ambiguity. These assertions are very unrealistic.\n\nNow let's look at the reliefs. After the hunting scene, the two men are suddenly priests, something that does not happen overnight. Priests, which were royalty, only hunted for pleasure, never for necessity. It can be concluded that these priests were actual priests of Khnum and the ways in which he – the Nile – enriched Egypt.\n\nNot only was Khnum god of the Nile and all things of the Nile, but he was also a god of pottery, which was only made possible by the Nile's influx bringing silt and clay every year. And guess what? The Temple had differing aspects of Egyptian life on opposite sides of the Temple walls: one of hunting and gathering at the Nile, and one of pottery and craftmaking. Later the image of men herding a goat can be seen as well. So, as we explored earlier, Khnum-in-life and Khnum-at-rest are describing two different ways of cultivating the Nile and everything it brought, one being active (hunting) and the other passive (pottery).\n\nAll evidence points to this place being a place of worship for Khnum. A festival to him, involving both food and crafts, can later be found, and the priests of Khnum are seen embracing. This leads others to think that this is simply the story of two closeted gay men (who had wives and children, by the way), but it is actually a sort of coming together for opposing means of cultivation and culture as brought by Khnum, hence the embrace.\n\nThanks for reading.\n\nedit: Changed \"brothers\" to \"men\" in some places, also added \"is\" as a minor grammar correction\n\nedit^2: changed another \"brothers\" to \"men,\" changed *xmn* to *xnm*.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/3o9zmu/asap_science_and_the_case_of_the_scientifically/",
        "text": "Our offender here today is [asapSCIENCE's latest work detailing a war on science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e1XX-ngJcc).  I actually came across this yesterday and thought about posting it here, then someone made a post asking for it here, so here we are.\n\nBefore we get started, the video's thesis is that science is important and that the governments of the developed world are letting vital scientific funding go by the wayside for ideological reasons.  And I think it's a completely fair point.  However, it is backed by some problematic history, and that's what we're here to discuss.\n\nMy eyebrow first was raised at about [50 seconds in](https://youtu.be/8e1XX-ngJcc?t=50s), when the video argues that modern developments in medicine and agriculture have saved more lives than have been lost in all wars, ever.  Maybe someone, somewhere out there has somehow compiled data to back this up, but it seems a bit of a vague and hyperbolic claim for someone who is holding the scientific method to such a high standard.  But it's minor, and I get his point.\n\nThen we get to the classic Giordano Bruno case, which is [no stranger](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/3245re/til_the_16th_century_monk_giordano_bruno_proposed/) -- [at all](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/200hoy/raskscience_is_hosting_a_thread_to_discuss_any/cfynce9) -- to this sub.  The TL/DR is that Bruno was not burned at the stake for his scientific views necessarily, [he was burned for his heretical theological views](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giordano_Bruno#Imprisonment.2C_trial_and_execution.2C_1593.E2.80.931600), as well as for stuff like dabbling in divinity.\n\nBut those are relatively minor, the biggest \"oh-boy\"s come at around [1:50](https://youtu.be/8e1XX-ngJcc?t=1m54s)\n\nLet's focus on his big argument: the Romans became complacent with Greek knowledge and that's why their empire fell.  There's quite a bit of bad in such a short blurb, so I'm just going hit each point that is problematic.\n\n- \"Subsequent Roman Empire\": ignores the 500 year Roman Republic and makes it sound like the Romans and Greeks came from the same place or something.  Romans commonly saw them themselves as the continuation of the Greeks, though, so I guess we can let this one slide.\n- Greek ideas were \"mostly\" embraced: kind of true, as much of Roman cosmology, art, and thought was, directly or indirectly, influenced by the Greeks.  The problem with this wording is that it implies the Romans were a continuation of the Greek world, which they weren't, and that the Romans were under some obligation to embrace everything Greek, which they also weren't.  I mean the Romans conquered all of the Greek world and then some, so clearly they were doing something right.\n- The Romans were complacent and little innovation or exploration of ideas took place: Oy.  The Romans were [master innovators, engineers, and inventors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_technology) and were, most egregiously in regards to the video, masters of adapting and reforming ideas and technologies of the cultures and peoples they encountered.  That said, Romans were generally more concerned with the practical and applied sciences over the metaphysical and theoretical sciences of the Greeks, but to argue that a state that lasted 1000 years, left a lasting impression on much of European history, and reached three continents was complacent with technology is just silly.  [I mean, who doesn't know the \"what have the Romans ever done for us?\" bit?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExWfh6sGyso)\n- Emphasis on \"reason\" and \"science\" slipped away:  Probably the worst claim here.  Now the subject of the fall of the Roman Empire [is a bit notorious for having every possible cause ever thought of attached to it](https://www.utexas.edu/courses/rome/210reasons.html), and while a lack of innovation in dealing with the problems the Empire faced could certainly be labeled a cause, blaming it on a lack of \"reason\" is pretty faulty.  I don't want to dive too deep into this, but this type of claim is historical STEM-o-vision: downplaying or ignoring the political, social, economic, religious, and historical reasons behind why something happened in favor of the scientific.  Now to the video's credit it doesn't explicitly say that was the only reason, but it's still a yucky claim that's annoyingly broad at best and utterly misleading at worst.\n-  Rome falls into the \"Dark Ages\": This [is also no stranger to badhistory](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/1vcffo/badhistory_of_christianity_part_3_the_christian/) and I won't harp on it too much.  Three big things come to mind when dealing with the classic \"Romans/Greeks were awesome and scientific, Dark ages were not\" topic.  Firstly, many \"lost\" Roman technologies, such as [Roman Concrete](http://www.romanconcrete.com/docs/spillway/spillway.htm), were lost not necessarily because people \"forgot\" them, but because they were only useful so long as a Roman state existed.  Without a Roman state to fund, supply, safely transport, and coordinate manpower for big projects, you're not going to have much ability to make something like an aqueduct or a Circus Maximus.  Secondly, plenty of technological innovation and scientific thinking absolutely did exist occur in \"Dark Age\" Europe, particularly in [the Byzantine world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Byzantine_inventions).  Thirdly, plenty of major scientific discoveries were being made outside of Europe during the Dark Ages, including world-changing inventions like [gunpowder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_gunpowder#Original_development).\n\nI could nitpick some other things but I recognize that he's only got 6 minutes to make a point that isn't that related to history.  That said, some of this is just inexcusably problematic, and I wish that the whole \"greeks into romans into dark ages\" myth didn't get caught up in what is otherwise is a fine video.",

        "text": "Original Thread: https://np.reddit.com/r/history/comments/2mi9a7/pick_a_turning_point_in_world_history/\n\nBrought to us by the subreddit r/history, or what I like to call the bastion of the uninformed masses who read wikipedia and believe they're qualified to have in-depth conversations about the subject matter.\nWe can begin with the OP who says\n\n&gt; This can be anything from an invention to a battle or war. For example I've always found the 1683 Battle of Vienna to be really intriguing for what it stopped from happening. It was a two day battle that occured between the combined Christian forces of the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation and Holy League of Poland &amp; Lithuania versus the Ottoman Empire. The Christian forces won and in so doing they halted the advance of their Islamic rivals across Europe. Many believe that had the battle been won by the Ottoman Empire that they would have pushed on an conquered what we now know as Germany and that they could have eventually overrun all of mainland Europe. The Ottoman Empire would stick around until the 20th century of course but this was the end of their rapid expansion in to Europe.\n\nFirstly, I mean what? \"Many believe that had the battle be won by the Ottoman Empire that they would have pushed on an[sic] conquered what we now know as Germany,\" and this is according to whom again? The Battle of Vienna was not the beginning of some epic Islamic crusade against the West, the Sultan felt slighted by the Hapsburg's disdain for territorial borders. There had been a peace even between the Hapsburg controlled Hungary and the Ottomans.\n\nSecondly, I would contend that it was in 1571 that the Ottoman Empire's grand plans of European domination were stomped out, not 1683. The battle of Lepanto served as a far more decisive turning point in historical context because the loss of Mediterranean power during a time in which the New world flooded the market with goods (namely silver which helped to cripple the Ottoman economy) essentially instantly antiquated the empire.\n\nThe most upvoted post is of course about a World War (because who didn't learn about the World Wars in their World History class in high school?) and its effects on the world.\n&gt;  WWI of course. It's known as the death of the Old World. If it didn't happen or German victory was gained in the first few weeks, there very well could still be a Tzar in Russia, an Emperor in Austria, a Sultan in Istanbul and a Kaiser in Germany. European colonies could still dot the globe( with larger White populations) The world would have been completely different.\n\nThis is reductionism at its absolute basic level. There could still be a Tsar in Russia? While the war may have perhaps served as a catalyst for the revolution due to the economic recession that swept the country, its not like the country hadn't already gone through a revolution 12 years prior. Social repression, economic wage slavery and 60-70 hour work weeks in factories didn't arrive because of World War 1.\n\nI have yet to find an academic believes the AustroHungarian Empire was going to regain its footing. After the failure of the Ausgleich the inability to mollify the masses of nationalism illustrates the terminal condition the empire found itself in by the beginning of the 20th century.\n\nThere could still be a Sultan in Istanbul? I'm not even sure this guy has read the wikipedia article on the Ottoman Empire to be honest. The Sykes-Picot Agreement, The Balfour Declaration and the McMahon–Hussein Correspondence clearly would have never been in existence if not for the great and all changing World War 1. Spoiler, the Ottoman Empire had been spiraling down for over 100 years before World War 1 ever began. There have been books written on the end of Ottoman Empire, and in not a single one of them does anyone say, \" Oh yeah, I mean if only that damn war hadn't happened we'd still have the great and glorious Ottoman Empire\".\n\nI've gone and upset myself, but I'd be remiss if I didn't make some mention of the final statement of European colonies dotting the world. Can you be any more eurocentric and dismissive of independence movements of indigenous people?\n\nSources: Tezcan, Baki.

Langdon had jumped.\n\nDan Brown's restroom gets described as being ten foot from the street, but 40 foot above. The real restroom in the first floor of the Denon wing of the Louvre is 20 meters from the street. This is just\n/r/badteleportationofrestrooms.\n\n&gt; Page 93: [Langdon is waiting in the shadows after the signal throw.]: \"Langdon could hear the sounds of DCPJ sirens tearing away from the Louvre. *A police exodus*. [The inspector] had hurried off as well, leaving the Grand Gallery deserted.\n\nOk, they are all following the signal. Somehow the police forgets that the dead curator is still lying in the Grand Gallery, as the inspector is described as running past the body on his way to the restroom. So they all leave a body and a crime scene unattended. Not that they were bound by procedure until now.\n\n&gt; Page 94: [Chapter 19 follows the assassin to the church Saint Sulpice. The description of the church:] \"The Church of Saint-Sulpice, it is said, has the most eccentric history of any building in Paris. Built over the ruins of an ancient temple to the Egyptian goddess Isis, the church possesses an architectural footprint matching that of Notre Dame within inches. The sanctuary has played host to the baptisms of the Marquis de Sade and Baudelaire...\"\n\nIt is also said that Dan Brown invented the whole temple of Isis story. Under the church, there are extensive crypts. The newer church was build after 1646 over the ruins of an older romanesque church (it is mentioned in 1159) , which had fallen into disrepair, the walls of the old church are still discernible in the crypts ([here](http://www.tombes-sepultures.com/crbst_1133.html) are some pictures of the crypts. Maybe some warning, there are some pictures of human bones on that site.) \nThere is no temple of Isis anywhere under the church. \n[The Church Saint Sulpice will be also mentioned below, the cliffhanger writing style of Dan Brown makes it hard to have all the badhistory of one subject in the same chapter.]\n \nIf we ignore the dimensions (\"within inches\") Saint Sulpice shares its \"architectural footprint\" with a lot of churches.\n\nBaudelaire and the Marquis de Sade are mentioned to give the church an aura of wickedness. There were thousands of other people baptised in Saint Sulpice, this is historical Cherry Picking.\n\n&gt; Page 98: [Langdon thinks about information given by Sophie about her and her grandfather, the curator:] \"*They played Tarot*? The medieval Italian card game was so replete with hidden heretical symbolism that Langdon had dedicated an entire chapter in his new manuscript to the Tarot. The game's twenty-two cards bore names like The Female Pope, The Empress and The Star. Originally, Tarot had been devised as a secret means to pass along ideologies banned by the Church.\"\n\nThere are a lot of old tarot card decks which have mystical, astrological, even heraldic symbols on them. To use them to pass along secret heretical meanings is a thing that is not documented. Divination in itself could be seen as heretical, but a larger ideological battle against the catholic church by tarot divinators is made up. Originally, Tarot was devised as a means to [play cards](http://www.lrb.co.uk/v02/n17/edmund-leach/tarot-triumph). \n\n/s I once heard that the King of Hearts in the French playing set is called Charles, after Charlemagne. This must be a conspiracy against the Capets and their descendants. Card player in France kept the opposition against the ursupators alive by playing cards, waiting for the true Karling heir to reveal himself. Then, the Karling gets killed by ALL of the Crusader King 2 players.\n\n&gt; Page 100: [Langdon remembers a lecture in which he mentioned the number PHI, a symbol used for the Golden Ratio. When asking who knows it, only a math major raises his hand and tells us this joke:] \"Not to be confused with PI. As we mathematicians like to say: PHI is one H of a lot cooler than PI.\" Langdon laughed, but nobody else seemed to get the joke.\n\nOh come on, the joke is not that hard to get. I get the feeling Dan Brown likes to paint the Americans as morons to us.\n\n&gt; Page 102 [Still Langdon is a PHI-phile.] \"Measure the distance from the tip of your head to the floor. Then divide that by the distance from your bellybotton to the floor. [BAM, PHI] [Here follows another half side of supposed occurances of PHI in nature, followed by how Leonardo and Michelangelo used PHI in their paintings and statues]\"\n\nI did that. I got 1.653 instead of 1.618. I'm a freak. Don't look at me. There is a large variation in nature and maybe it would be the \"perfect\" ratio to be, a lot of nature doesn't follow it. Or this is what ugly people like me tell themselves. I go and eat a truck of chocolate, if you excuse me.\n\nThere are a lot of instances in Leonardo's work where one could find the golden ratio into a work (the Mona Lisa, for example), but interestingly, not in the [\"Man after Vitruvius\"](http://www.crl.nitech.ac.jp/~ida/education/VitruvianMan/). [Here](http://web.archive.org/web/20130701231636/http://www.maa.org/devlin/devlin_06_04.html) is a Math Association of America blog about the problem of finding the golden ratio everywhere.\n\n&gt; Page 103 [Still Langdon's lecture, he somehow gets back to \"symbolism\"]: \"Tomorrow, I'll show you [Leonardo's] fresco *The last Supper*, which is one of the most astonishing tributes to the sacred feminine you will ever see.\"\n\nThe Last Supper is no fresco, meaning fresh, because the plaster has to be so fresh that it is still wet. It was painted a secco, meaning on the dry plaster. [This is one of the reasons it deteriorated so quickly](http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/leon/hd_leon.htm). \n\nThe sacred feminine part I will not discuss here, I have the feeling it will come back and haunt us in a future installment. \n\n&gt; Page 105 [Langdon thinking about anagrams:] \"The Romans actually referred to the study of anagrams as *ars magna* - \"the great art\".\"\n\nThere is no indication that the Romans refered to anagrams as \"ars magna\". \n\nWhat there is, however, is a sentence in Foucault’s Pendulum which goes \"Anagrams = ars magna\", showing that ars magna is an anagram of \"anagrams\". This anagram doesn't work in Latin, however, since the Latin word for anagram is \"anagramma\". \n\nThere are later books, one by Ramond Llull, a 13th century mystic (who gets mentioned in Foucault's Pendulum, of course), which uses \"Ars magna\" to refer to his machine that could combine words and one of Gerolamo Cardano, a 16th century Italian mathematician, which title, \"Ars magna\", refers to Algebra. \n\n&gt; Page 113 [Chapter 22, the assassin look around in Saint Sulpice:] \"[He sees a brass strip on the church floor, which combined with an obilisk makes an astronomical device.] It was a gnomon, [the assassin] had been told, a pagan astronomical device like a sundial.\"\n\n&gt; [The novel calls the brass line, which the sunlight passes each day at noon, as part of the gnomon:] \"*The Rose Line*\"\n\n&gt;[The assassin had been told by his superior:] \"That it was an ancient sundial of sorts, a vestige of the pagan temple that had once stood on this very spot.\" \n\n&gt;[The novel then says that the prime meridian is also called the Rose Line and that] \"Long before the establishment of Greenwich as the prime meridian, the zero longitude of the entire world had passed directly through Paris and through the Church of Saint Sulpice. The brass marker in Saint-Sulpice was a memorial of the world's first prime meridian, and although Greenwich had stripped Paris of the honor in 1888, the original Rose Line is still visible today.\"\n\nThere are enough sun-dials on churches to dispel any accusation that gnomons are especially pagan.\n\nNobody called the prime meridian the Rose Line. (Spoiler!) This is owned to the sheenanigans Brown later does with Roselyn. \n\nSee above, there is no ancient temple under Saint Sulpice. The gnomon was raised on the orders of the priest of Saint Sulpice. He wanted to know when to ring the bells at noon.\n\nWhile it is true that there was a Paris Meridian, which was established in 1634 and measured by a French astronomer named Jean Picard (really.), Saint Sulpice lies about 150 meters West of that line. It is by no means the first of its kind, as every projection of the round surface of the earth on a flat surface needs one. \nBefore 1884 (not 1888), when the International Meridian Conference made the Greenwich Meridian World's prime meridian, every country could have it's own prime meridian.\nThe French abstained in that conference and continued to use the Paris Median until 1911.",

Brown tries to make it sound like the Pope would be their only authority outside Opus Dei.\n\n&gt; [Still the nun thinks about Opus Dei]: \"Suspiciously, the Opus Dei's elevation occurred the same year the wealthy sect allegedly had transferred almost one billion dollars into the Vatican's Institute for Religious Works [the Vatican Bank] [...] bailing it out of an embarrassing bankruptcy.\"\n\nFor a nun, she has quite detailled knowledge of supposed trade secrets of the Vatican. And of things Dan Brown made up. Maybe she had visions.\n\n&gt; [Still the nun about Opus Dei]: \"[Another strange thing about Opus Dei:] the Pope placed the founder of Opus Dei on the \"fast track\" for sainthood accelerating an often century-long waiting period for canonization to a mere twenty years.\"\n\nPope John Paul beatified 1340 persons, among them Mother Teresa who was beatified 6 years after her death, and canonized 482 persons in 27 years. He himself was canonized nine years after his death, the process started 3 month after his death. So, maybe canonization is not as rare or always as slow as Brown suggests, at least after John Paul II streamlined the process.\n\n&gt; Page 49: [We're back at the Louvre with Langdon and the inspector discovering that the curator painted a circle around his naked, spread-eagled corpse.] \"\"*The Vitruvian Man*,Langdon grasped. [By making the circle visible through black-light, the inspector] had recreated a life-sized replica of Leonard Da Vinci's most famous stretch.\" \n\nThe naked man in the sketch is in both a circle and a square. So being only in a circle, that makes the curator only half the vitruvian man *The Vitruvian Man* was. And me half of that.\n\n&gt; Page 50: [The inspector to Langdon about Leonardo:] \"...[C]ertainly, a man like yourself is aware that Leonardo da Vinci had a tendency toward the darker arts.\"\n\nWhy does the book alter between \"Leonardo Da Vinci\" and \"Leonardo da Vinci\"? It's like someone sometimes remembered that it was not Leonardo's surname (see the first post about the book). That's just r/badmemoryofmyownspelling (With apologies to Snappy for the empty link. Keep following your dream of world domination, little binary lad!)\n\n&gt; [Langdon thinks about why the inspector accuses Da Vi... I mean Leonardo of \"a tendency to the darker arts\", and I will reproduce the paragraph here in its supreme badhistoric glory]:\"Da Vinci had always been an awkward subject for historians, especially in the Christian tradition. Despite the visionary's genius, he was a flamboyant homosexual and worshipper of Nature's divine order, both of which placed him in a state of perpetual sin against God. Moreover, the artist's eerie eccentricities projected an admittedly demonic aura: Da Vinci exhumed corpses to study human anatomy; he kept mysterious journals in illegible reverse handwriting; he believed he possessed the alchemic power to turn lead into gold and even cheat God by creating an elixir to postpone death; and his inventions included horrific, never-before-imagined weapons of war and torture.\"\n \nEven if Leonardo would have liked the non-fairer-sex far more than the other one, it would be idiotic to call him a \"flamboyant homosexual\" with the connotations of the 20./21. century this carries. I would like to refer to the \"What is the historical viewpoint of homosexuality\" [thread](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/p4jqc/what_is_the_historical_viewpoint_on_homosexuality/) in the askhistorians faq. \n\nBeing a worshipper of \"Nature's divine order\" sounds like Dan Brown's Leonardo being some kind of druid, which he certainly was not. Have you seen Stonehenge? The Leonardo version would have been way cooler. But most likely, he would have painted it and never build it.\n\nIt's true that Leonard dissected, but that was hardly unheard of or even strange. While in Rome, he was allowed to dissect and watch public dissections of executed felons (or maybe also poor people) in the hospital Santo Spirito, as had many people, by the Pope.\n\nLeonardo certainly did not believe that he could make gold out of lead. There is nothing that suggests that he had an interest in alchemy, he even ridiculed alchemists of believing such nonsense in his notebooks.\n\nThe weapons machines of death and torture were all imaginary, like his flying machines. \n\nThe part about the handwriting is just the jaywalk to the things like cheating death and machines of torture. But let me phrase it this way: compared to Leonardo's handwriting, my own looks like a chimp tried to write backwards with a half-eaten crayon. Leonardo's is legible even when it's written backwards.\n\n&gt; [Still Langdon about Leonardo:] \"Even Da Vinci's enormous output of breathtaking Christian art only furthered the artist's reputation for spiritual hypocrisy. Accepting hundreds of lucrative Vatican commissions... \"\n\nLeonardo's output wasn't in any way breathtaking. He had a reputation of being so distracted that he could not do the work he wanted to do, producing only few pieces art when compared to other painters.

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/3nz4m6/golliwog_apologia_which_is_apparently_still_a/",
        "text": "The bad history is this following account of the origins of the 'golliwog'. I would post a link to it but I can't find the origin of the bad history, and it tends to appear everywhere from the Herald Sun to Stormfront. If anyone can find the original author of it, though, I will happily credit them.\n\n&gt;The origins of the Golliwog began with the British soldiers who occupied Egypt near the end of the nineteenth century. The Egyptian labourers working for the British wore the letters W.O.G.S. on their armbands, indicating that they were Working On Government Service. These labourers were spoken of as Ghuls – the Arabic word for desert ghost – by the British troops. The children of the Egyptians played with black stuffed material dolls. These dolls in turn were given as gifts or purchased by the soldiers returning home to England. These dolls became known as Ghuliwogs, a name which would eventually become the Golliwog we know today.\n\nFirstly, the folk-etymology backronym! Famous from such imaginary word-histories as '[Fornicating Under Consent of the King](http://www.snopes.com/language/acronyms/fuck.asp)' and '[Port Out, Starboard Home](http://www.snopes.com/language/acronyms/posh.asp)', it is a common way of making up the origin of a word because it only has to sound vaguely reasonable for people to swallow it. Very few words actually come about this way, though – the exceptions tend to be technical words like '[laser](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Laser#/Terminology)' or 'radar' – and there is simply no evidence that the racial slur 'wog' originated as an acronym. No arm-bands have been turned up or photographs of workers wearing them. And there is a better alternative to this fanciful etymology, which I'll get to later.\n\nWhoever authored this deserves points for doubling-down on the 'make up something which sounds like it could be true and then assert it as if it is' tactic, though. 'Ghul' is indeed an Arabic word, which essentially means 'ghoul', and if you're attempting to reverse engineer a plausible origin for a word then it makes sense to use nouns for your source material. Again, though, the problem is a lack of evidence when there is a better explanation available – tellingly, when you perform an [Ngram search](https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=golliwog%2Cghuliwog%2CGhuliwog%2CGolliwogg%2CGolliwog&amp;year_start=1800&amp;year_end=2000&amp;corpus=0&amp;smoothing=1&amp;share=&amp;direct_url=t1%3B%2Cgolliwog%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2CGolliwogg%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2CGolliwog%3B%2Cc0) on 'ghuliwog' or 'Ghuliwog' the word doesn't turn up at all, suggesting it wasn't used in print whatsoever, even as the terms 'golliwog' and 'Golliwogg' were thriving.\n\nAs far as I can tell, [this](http://i.imgur.com/GFvGj21.png) is the original golliwog from Florence K. Upton's *[The Adventures of two Dutch Dolls and a \"Golliwogg\"](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/16770/16770-h/16770-h.htm)*, first published in 1895. Note how \"Golliwogg\" (so spelled) is thrown in quotation marks, as if the word wasn't already in use at the time. Also note how similar the doll is to earlier blackface depictions of African Americans in the minstrel tradition – coal-black skin, exaggerated, reddened lips, colourful attire with giant bow-ties – which we can find examples of from throughout the nineteenth century, including [1832](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/86/Jimcrow.jpg?1444308718034), [1844](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/93/Dandy_Jim_from_Caroline.jpg/800px-Dandy_Jim_from_Caroline.jpg?1444308757439), [1875](http://www.loc.gov/pictures/resource/var.0241/), [1890](http://www.loc.gov/pictures/resource/var.1790/), [1892](http://www.loc.gov/pictures/resource/var.1792/), [1899](http://www.loc.gov/pictures/resource/cph.3g10477/) and [1900](http://www.loc.gov/pictures/resource/var.1828/). Rather than being developed from Egyptian cloth dolls, it seems golliwogs were based upon popular illustrations of African Americans from the United States – which Upton encountered from her upbringing in New York and subsequently brought to Britain.\n\nAs for the term 'golliwog' itself, it seems it was mostly a made-up word, as Upton claims, but was possibly based on the existing slang-word 'pollywog' (tadpole). This is the Pokemon approach to making up fictional names. Take an existing word and just adapt it slightly – i.e. Diglett/piglet, Squirtle/turtle and, appropriately enough, [Poliwag](http://pokemondb.net/pokedex/poliwag)/pollywog. (Bringing things full circle there is also, of course, a blackface Pokemon. It is called [Jynx](http://pokemondb.net/pokedex/jynx).) The golliwogs books went on to be quite popular, eventually becoming characters in Enid Blyton's Noddy books, and it was likely from this popularity that the word was adapted into a racial slur. That is, 'wog' came from 'golliwog', and not the other way round.\n\nIt is understandable why people leap to invent innocent histories for things like golliwogs. They are a cherished children's toy, and we want golliwogs to be innocent in the same way we want to remember our childhoods as being innocent. The alternative is to admit that they are tainted by a difficult past, and that we should abandon them if we care about doing away with racism. But as much as I sympathise with not wanting to let go of something you cherished as a child – I recently rediscovered my old Lego catalogues, and couldn't bring myself to throw them all out – it's important not to rewrite the past in order to pretend that blatant racism wasn't, well, blatant racism.

I've never seen any of these before, so I'm approaching these with fresh eyes, unprejudiced by fond childhood memories. I'm thus preppared to be harsh and cruel in the treatment of the badhistory contained within these children's shows.\n\n**0:16**\n\n\"It's time for us to band together. It's time for us to become Patriots!\". The vastly preferred nomenclature for the anti-government forces at this point in time was Whigs. It wasn't until much later that they would start to call themselves Patriots, and even then it was still a minority. \n\n**0:25**\n\n[Wrong flag](http://i.imgur.com/IIU2nVk.jpg). This version of the Union Jack didn't come into existence until 1801. At the time of the Revolutionary War the diagonal stripes would've both been all white. No red whatsoever.\n\n**0:48**\n\n[Nice beard](http://i.imgur.com/PwJX9RR.jpg). Too bad it's the 18th century when facial hair was frowned on. I'd cut him some slack for being on a long sea voyage, but if he has a way to shave his damn mustache, he has a way to shave the damn beard (especially since the other crewman we see is clean shaven). Also what the hell is up with his outfit? Looks like a modern raincoat and sweater that he's wearing. \n\n**1:02**\n\nWhat the hell is up with [this dress](http://i.imgur.com/16L7PRv.jpg)? It sure as hell isn't a late 18th century woman's outfit. See, for example [this](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/7c/07/b1/7c07b1a56ae80407c469cc766a5d2efd.jpg) 1777 portrait of a young woman in blue. \n\nAlso that writing quill is absolutely ridiculous. Practical 18th century writing quills would look more like [this](http://i.imgur.com/1amsR7K.jpg) (carrying case included!). I think the inkpot is also over the top as well, but there were some rather over the top ones during the time period so I'll let it slide.\n\n(The dialogue here is cringeworthy. Just so y'all know)\n\n**2:48**\n\nThe cut on [this shirt](http://i.imgur.com/AUV66ta.jpg) and vest is all wrong for the 1770s. Much more reminiscent of the late 1790s/early 1800s. At least they're showing them working in their waistcoats, so good job there. \n\n**3:47**\n\nThe idea of a black man being in charge of Franklin's printing shop while he was away is ridiculous. Franklin did eventually become president of the Pennsylvania Society for Promoting the Abolition of Slavery, but that wasn't until 1787. In 1773 a black man having that much assertiveness and control over a white man in Pennsylvania just wasn't feasible.\n\n**4:19**\n\nFranklin claims that Philadelphia is the second largest city in the Empire. This is simply not true. Exact figures are hard to come by for this time period, but best estimates put Philadelphia at ~35,000 people at this point. Bristol was bigger (~50,000); Glasgow was probably bigger than Philadelphia; Birmingham, Liverpool, and Manchester were all between 30,000 and 40,000. ^1\n\n**5:03**\n\nSamuel Adams the rabble rouser. Adams was called a publican and certain historians have assumed this meant he frequented bars and taverns. This isn't true. He was called a publican because of his job working as a tax collector. See [this](http://allthingsliberty.com/2014/02/you-wont-believe-how-samuel-adams-recruited-sons-of-liberty/) article by J.L. Bell on how Adams actually recruited for the Sons of Liberty.\n\n**6:38**\n\nSamuel Adams proposes that the men in the bar join together to become the Sons of Liberty. In actuality Samuel Adams was not even present when the Sons of Liberty was first established. It was actually a group of nine men led by Thomas Crafts (a painter) and George Trott (a jeweler) who had banded together to resist the Stamp Act (not the Tea Act!) and who called themselves the Loyal Nine. Samuel Adams and John Adams were late to that particular party. \n\n**6:53**\n\nAfter a rabble-rousing speech in a **bar**!?!?! the Whigs whoop and holler down to the harbor to start the Tea Party. *Sigh*. This is *really* bad history. The show implies that the *Dartmouth* had just come into the harbor, when in reality it had been in the harbor for 18 days (November 28 to December 16). There had been a long series of meetings held about the situation and what to do, and the last meeting was held at Old South Meeting Hall on Dec 16. About 7,000 people attended that meeting, and it was after that meeting that action was taken.^2\n\n**7:42**\n\nI like how the three kids are sneaking around trying to uncover the scoop of the century. As if the thousands of people at Old South Meeting Hall weren't at the docks already.\n\n**7:59**\n\nThose are awfully small tea chests. The tea chests from that night actually looked like [this](http://i.imgur.com/VVB50AC.jpg) (this is an actual surviving chest from that night). Also they broke open the chests and removed the tea which was in loose leaves. There was so much of it that people had to go out and push it back down the next day to make sure it was all destroyed. \n\n**8:10**\n\nThe kids are making a plan to go rescue \"Miss Phillips\". There was absolutely no need for this, as the destruction of the tea was conducted in an orderly manner. In fact it was so orderly that when a lock on one of the tea chests was destroyed it was replaced, and when one of the party tried to shove some tea down his pants he was tossed over board. It was no mob of crazed individuals. \n\n**8:56**\n\nOne of the kids shouts the phrase \"No taxation without representation\" and says he has no idea what it means. It's possible that he didn't know what the phrase meant in December of 1773, however the phrase was used in town meetings in New Hampshire and Massachusetts in January of 1774. The bigger issue here is the \"assistant journalist\" acting as if the phrase was unheard before the Tea Party, when in fact it was coined in 1767 in London of all places. \nFun fact: It was coined by a London newspaper editor to summarize a speech given by an English Lord (to be fair the English Lord was Lord Camden one of the most influential and noted Whigs of the era, but I find it somewhat ironic that the great American Revolutionary slogan is actually an English one.) See [this](http://allthingsliberty.com/2013/05/no-taxation-without-representation-part-2/) research by J.L. Bell for more information. \n\n**10:30**\n\nReally annoying grammar pedantry from a grammar rule that wouldn't exist until at least a century later. And he wasn't even wrong in his usage of who even according to prescriptivist thought, because who is supposed to be used in the subject position, as in \"Who will I be quoting?\"\n\n**11:23**\n\n*More* really bad history. Samuel Adams spots British soldiers coming and shouts \"Redcoats! Abandon ship!\". Only no British soldiers ever got involved, because A.) They were too far away, B.) The ships were private property and not government property, and C.) They didn't want a repeat of the Boston Massacre. The men involved in the Tea Party certainly didn't \"abandon ship\". They were very thorough about the job, even going so far as to sweep up the decks when they were done!\n\n**14:40**\n\nNo, there was not a curfew in Boston in 1773. \n\n**15:14**\n\nMoses does an impressive job of reciting one of Phillis Wheatley's poems called \"An Address to the Atheist\". It's in the collection of the Massachussetts Historical Society and can be seen [here](http://www.masshist.org/database/viewer.php?item_id=780&amp;mode=dual&amp;img_step=1#page1). It was even written in 1767, which means it was early enough to have spread to Philadelphia whre Moses could have read it and memorized it (assuming he was literate of course--a big assumption). One small problem. That particular poem was never published. \n\n**15:24**\n\nI'm glad they're going to be talking about Phillis Wheatley, but by this point she was no longer a slave. She had received her manumission by October 18, 1773. She would not have been a slave on the night of December 16, 1773. \n\nAlso her brief biography here in the show gets her literary career a bit wrong. She didn't know Greek. She was very educated, not just for a black woman, but for a woman in general. She did know at least some Latin, but not Greek. She actually began publishing individual poems in newspapers and  magazines as early as 1767, and her first collection of poems was published in London in 1773.^3 \n\n**18:34**\n\nAfter a discussion on slavery Sarah makes the argument that in England slavery is dying. This is a bit of a stretch, all things considered. She's probably referring to recent Somersett case, which really only decided that a slave could not be forcibly removed from England (to say go to one of England's colonies such as the West Indies or to India or elsewhere). England was very much involved in the slave trade still and English ports were essential in keeping the slave trade alive. \n\n**20:21**\n\nBenjamin Franklin is being yelled at for being a bad boy and is being accused of instigating the Boston Tea Party through his speeches and letters. Franklin was actually rather moderate on most of the issues, and certainly wasn't part of the radical crowd at all. The incident being referenced here is likely the culimination of the [Hutchinson Letters Affair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hutchinson_Letters_Affair) which, in 1773, saw Franklin come into possession of letters written by Thomas Hutchinson to Andrew Oliver. The letters concerned reaction by Massachusetts to the Stamp Act Protests and they were regarded by radicals in MA as showing a complete disregard for Massachussetts liberty. Franklin sent them to a few politicians in MA with instructions not to publish them, but that he didn't care who they were shown to. \n\nAfter a long campaign orchestrated by Samuel Adams against Hutchinson the letters were finally published in June 1773. Then the Boston Tea Party happens in December, and in January 1774 Franklin gets called to the Privy Council and gets torn a new one by the Solicitor-General Alexander Wedderburn. \n\nWhile the speech here is nice and sarcastic, I'm not sure why listing Poor Richard's Almanack is relevant to a situation in 1774, since the Almanack ceased publication in 1758!!\n\n1.)

        "text": "I came across [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bncAhDrKS-I) recently and just kind of stared at it for a moment. I got a cookie and ate that while watching it, but that didn't help, so now I'm here. The video is entitled \"The 3 Most Pointless Wars in History,\" and while I can understand putting a list like that together, how the guy does it is a bit odd. \n\nFrom the outset, it's clear that how he's defining \"pointless\" is not at all how I or likely most historians would define pointless. His definition of a non-pointless war would be one in which there was some kind of territorial change (country A gets island B, etc.), and that anything else is \"white peace.\" It's a problematic definition on many levels, not the least of which is that modern warfare doesn't work like this anymore (as will be illustrated in one part of his video). It also ignores the fact that war isn't always fought over territory, or that it can have other repercussions beyond territorial ones. As an example, during the American Civil War, there was no territorial change, but I'll be damned if there weren't some serious repercussions in a war that ultimately shaped the future of the country. By this video's definition, it's a pointless war. \n\nLet's look at this more closely, though. The first war that's listed as being pointless is the Invasion of the Spanish Armada in 1588, which isn't technically a war, but I'll let it slide. The narrator's argument is that, because Phillip's fleet had a bad time and ultimately failed in its mission, it was a pointless war. No territory changed, no one lost their head, so it was pointless. However, this ignores the greater context of the war, what it meant for the future of England, and why it was fought at all. \n\nIt's very important to keep in mind that Phillip's invasion fleet had the blessing of Pope Sixtus V and was seen as a crusade. Phillip's Catholicism was very much a motivation for the invasion when set against Elizabeth's Protestantism. The Armada can be seen as a greater extension of the wars of religion across Europe, and had Phillip succeeded, England and the New World would have gone down a radically different path. \n\nMore importantly, though, is what Phillip was trying to do. Beyond the religious aspect - which was huge and shouldn't be discounted - Phillip was also fighting against Elizabeth's support of Dutch rebels and English privateering and smuggling. Spanish trade was suffering due to privateer attacks, and Phillip had every motivation to force the English to stop harassing his treasure fleets. With the invasion, he had a chance to stop English meddling, reassert Spanish control over the Low Countries, and bring England back to Catholicism. From his perspective, this was dreadfully important. Whether or not he succeeded is irrelevant to how important this was for him.\n\nWhat really demonstrates this, though, is how the defeat of the Spanish Armada is viewed in the British psyche. Throughout British history since, the victory is evoked in times of struggle or as a symbol of what the British can do. During the Blitz, for instance, it was invoked as a reminder to the populace that England had and always would prevail. Even beyond the historical legacy, the victory over the Spanish helped solidify Elizabeth's hold on the throne and greatly increased her popularity. Territory didn't have to change hands - just knowing that she won was enough to have a large impact on the future of the British Isles.\n\nIndeed, even the idea that there has to be a victor for a war not to be pointless is an incorrect understanding of what war is and what its point is. The third war he lists (I'm skipping the second for now because of narrative flow) is the Iran-Iraq War, which absolutely ended in a stalemate and no territorial change (much to Iran's chagrin), but which still served a purpose. Both sides felt threatened by the other's military and political clout, but beyond proving something to each other, each also sought political dominance in the region, and a victory in the war would secure that. Iran, too, was seeking to legitimise the Iranian Revolution and stir Iraq's Shi'a population into rebelling as well. In Iraq, victory in the war became interlaced with Saddam Hussein's cult of personality, and was seen as part of being Iraqi. \n\nWhat matters as well is what each saw themselves as fighting for. The causes were complex. As I mentioned, political dominance was at stake, but for the average soldier, it was national and religious identity that was being fought for. Iran was very much framing the war as a jihad and a chance to provoke more Islamic revolutions. Iraq saw it as a fight for national survival as well as a fight to preserve Iraqi national identity in the face of political and religious invaders. As Saddam ramped up attacks on Kurds as well, this fight for Iraqi identity became even more central to the war. Much like with the UK during the Blitz, it became un-Iraqi to not contribute to the war effort in as many ways as possible - once again, strengthening Saddam's political power. Each had very clear domestic goals as well as foreign and territorial ones. The fact that no one won doesn't detract from these goals, nor does it make people striving to accomplish them pointless. Indeed, the Iran-Iraq War did have later effects, particularly with the Gulf War, Iraq's decision to fight it, and how it ultimately was fought. \n\nBut what's really baffling is the second example, which is the assertion that the Taiping Rebellion was pointless because it was solely about following around some guy who thought he was the brother of Jesus. Beyond that being a gross oversimplification of the Taiping Rebellion, labeling the Taiping Rebellion as \"pointless\" is essentially the same as labeling the American Civil War as pointless. There was no territorial change, but the political ramifications were huge and far-reaching. The Taiping Rebellion weakened the Chinese imperial government, opening it up to even greater Western influence. Weakening the government (and ideally overthrowing it, but let's not be too optimistic here) was *absolutely* the goal of the Taiping Rebellion, and it succeeded. How it's pointless because of that, I have no idea.\n\nReally, though, the term \"pointless\" strikes me a meaningless term when it comes to history. I admit, I might be willing to accept the term if it has a definition other than the one this video gives it, but I suspect there isn't one that can capture why people fight a war in the first place. Territory doesn't have to change for a war to be fought for a reason. Indeed, wars generally aren't fought for no reason at all, and while people lose or have stalemates, that doesn't mean the reasons they initially went to war weren't there, or that the political implications of the war are any less valid. Quite simply, the idea of a \"pointless\" war is itself pointless.",

        "text": "The internet's number one purveyor of bad history presents us with its usual weird-headed mix of contrarianism and one-sidedness by giving us another angle on well-known figures in an article entitled '[5 Terrible Lies You've Been Told About Famous People](http://www.cracked.com/article_23002_5-terrible-lies-youve-been-told-about-famous-people_p2.html)'. Now, I'm sure every entry presents us with several flavours of wrong, but I've decided to focus on entry number three on the list: **Queen \"Bloody Mary\" Of England Wasn't That Bloody**.\n\nCracked starts to get things wrong in the very first sentence:\n\n&gt;After notorious wife decapitator Henry VIII stuck both middle fingers up to the Catholic Church and founded the Church of England as his country's new official religion, he died and left his son Edward in charge, rather than his not-so-beloved daughter Mary.\n\nThis is sort-of-true, in that Henry passed the Succession Act, which specified who his heirs were: Edward, then Mary, then Elizabeth, assuming the first two died without heirs (as, in fact, happened). However, this wasn't exactly necessary as Edward was the legitimate male heir and would've inherited the throne anyway under the rule of male primogeniture (only recently abolished in the English monarchy).\n\nThe Act was only necessary because Henry's marriage to Catherine of Aragon, his first wife, had been declared illegal due to the fact that she had previously been married to Henry's elder brother (who dropped dead at a young age, as often happened at the time). This meant that Mary was officially a bastard, so the fact that she was specifically put into the line of succession was an act of contrition on Henry's part, effectively legitimating his eldest daughter. After all, he managed to father other, actual bastards who weren't made heirs to the throne.\n\nSo, while Henry was certainly capable of some fairly magnificent dick moves, making it clear that Edward was his primary heir was not one of them: The marriage that produced Edward took place after the deaths of Henry's first two wives, and so both the marriage and Edward were 100% legit however you look at it. To say that Henry left the throne to Edward 'rather than' Mary implies that Mary was somehow cheated out of the throne, which is the opposite of true.\n\n&gt;But after Edward's death, with no male heirs, the rules of succession declared Mary the first English monarch in history to possess a vagina.\n\nI could give Cracked a pass, here, but frankly they haven't earned it. So fuck 'em.\n\nIn one sense it's true that Mary was the first female English monarch. In another, it isn't: Empress Matilda was Queen way back in 1141, having inherited the throne from her father in the usual way before being usurped. However, she was never crowned, so it's unclear whether this counts or not. Additionally, Mary herself supplanted a female usurper in the form of Lady Jane Grey, who was named heir by Edward VI in his will shortly before his death (contrary to the Succession Act). However, like Matilda, Jane was never crowned and was deposed after just nine days, and then, this being the 16th century, beheaded at the age of just 16. Her claim is definitely looser than Matilda's, as it clearly had little to do with the rule of primogeniture and obviously contravened the Succession Act. But fuck it.\n\nAlso, Mary's succession was not down to the age-old 'rules of succession' lazily invoked here. Instead, as mentioned above, the Succession Act had to be passed in order to clear up the issue. In terms of the usual rules of primogeniture that govern succession in the English monarchy, her status as a sort-of bastard made it far from clear that she should be Queen. If she was indeed a bastard, there were several male bastards of Henry's who could presumably have laid claim to the throne, as well as other legitimate grandchildren of Henry VII. This is not even to go into the whole deal surrounding the Yorkist claim to the throne, which still existed at that time.\n\nLong story short: 'Rules of succession', no. Specific Acts of Parliament and a sort of shrugging, yeah-that-makes-sense kind of acceptance, yes. Is this enormously pedantic? Also yes! But fuck it.\n\n&gt;Upon learning that a Catholic was back on the throne, a group of Protestants organized a coup against her. Mary quashed it, but she was extremely hesitant to order their executions, and only did so after they repeatedly refused to stop trying to murder her.\n\nGiven that much of the nobility, including the Privy Council, were involved in the coup attempt, Mary's hesitancy to immediately execute everyone involved can be read in more than one way way: Hesitancy, after all, doesn't equal mercy. It's just as possible that she recognised that she was in a position of weakness and didn't want to make martyrs of the deposed Jane or the conspirators that put her (briefly) on the throne. Once Mary's power was consolidated, Jane quickly found out that the phrase 'Off with her head' has become a cliché for a reason.\n\nWhatever her immediate reaction to a Protestant coup, having initially promised religious tolerance, Mary waited just a few months before she started to imprison Protestants. Her first Parliament quickly undid the Protestant reforms of Edward VI, and did the same for her father's less extreme Protestant reforms shortly afterwards. Amongst other things, this meant that all married priests were deprived of their income and effectively defrocked.\n\nIn other words, Mary was far from hesitant to start persecuting Protestants right from the start of her reign.\n\n&gt;[Mary's] platform was church reform, and she fought for a form of Catholicism that had more in common with the reformist Protestantism that her people seemed to want than the old-fashioned religion being sold back in Rome. \n\nI've never heard this anywhere before. As far as I know, Mary's biggest concession to the realities of the situation were to not re-confiscate the lands that had been handed over to various nobles following the dissolution of the monasteries under Henry VIII, which was hardly a doctrinal decision. Like her 'hesitancy' to execute Jane and the other conspirators, this is more down to an unwillingness to be immediately deposed and executed by angry nobles than it is a sign of actual flexibility, religious or otherwise.\n\n&gt;There's no denying that an awful lot of Protestants were killed during \"Bloody Mary's\" reign,\n\nFinally, we're talking sense!\n\n&gt;but she was really no worse than her successor, Queen Elizabeth. (That is, Elizabeth the First, not the current one. She's not that old.) After Mary's death in 1558, Elizabeth took the throne and proceeded to order the deaths of just as many Catholics as Mary had Protestants. The difference was that Elizabeth's executions were portrayed as having been ordered for \"political reasons\" rather than religious ones, which magically made them okay. \n\nOh. Oh.\n\nPartly, the author is guilty of inconsistency: Mary is lauded for not immediately executing people who tried to depose her, while Elizabeth is condemned for… Immediately executing people who tried to depose her.\n\nElizabeth had in fact had the Catholic equivalent of a fatwa issued against her: A Catholic who killed her was, according to the Pope, definitely going to go to heaven. Furthermore Spain, then Europe's foremost Catholic power, was convinced that their king was also King of England because of his marriage to Mary I. The Spanish Armada famously tried and failed to invade England during Elizabeth's reign.\n\nRefusing to tolerate people who have been ordered to kill you and who keep trying to invade your country is hardly the act of a despot. Yes, Elizabeth killed lots of Catholics, but the 'political reasons' derided by the author were mainly 'trying to kill the Queen'. The numerous attempts on Elizabeth's life, the attempted invasion by Spain, and the Gunpowder Plot (a Catholic conspiracy that took place under the reign of Elizabeth's successor) all attest to the seriousness of the Cathloic threat to both the kingdom and the Queen personally. Obviously, by modern standards, burning them at the stake is a bit of an overreaction, but, as we know, presentism is bad.\n\nMainly, though, the author's just wrong. Mary had nearly 300 Protestants burned alive in five years, including Thomas Cranmer, who recanted his Protestantism and so should, by the standards of the day, have been let off the hook. Mary had him burned anyway, at which point he recanted his recantation, so maybe she had a point. But anyway. By contrast, Elizabeth repealed the Heresy Acts specifically in order to prevent such persecution, and burned fewer of her religious opponents in forty-four years on the throne than her sister managed in five. Except, of course, for those of them who kept trying to kill her, who were not so much religious dissenters as assassins and traitors.\n\nElizabeth, unlike Mary, really did effect a religious compromise, which, ironically enough, led to her being criticised by Protestants who didn't think she was Protestant enough. Unlike Mary, who reversed virtually all the reforms of her Protestant predecessors and set about burning anyone who disagreed, Elizabeth took a much more accommodating approach, and was rewarded for her efforts by being condemned by both sides at the time, and having to put up with shitty comparisons between her and her sister by half-baked internet writers four hundred years later.\n\n***\n\nThe main problem with this section of the Cracked article is that the author attempts to draw simple comparisons between Mary and Elizabeth in order to pretend that our perception of their reigns is completely back-to-front. Obviously it's a bad idea to pass moral judgements on people who lived four hundred years ago: People living under either Queen would have difficulty recognising our modern interpretation of their reigns, whether as hideous tyrannies or golden ages of peace and tolerance.\n\nHowever, in attempting to redress the perceived imbalance, Cracked commits the exact same fallacy of trying to work out some level of moral equivalence while also twisting and manipulating the facts to shore up their daft contrarian argument. The fact is, it was no picnic being a religious dissenter in Europe for a period lasting several centuries, regardless of where you were or who was in charge. But, if you horribly execute 300 people for disagreeing with you, you should expect to end up with a mean nickname.\n\n***\n\n**EDIT**: For a very well-written and -informed riposte to much of what I've written, check out [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/3nl4md/cracked_does_it_again_it_in_this_case_being/cvpflmd) from /u/baapalmer, who clearly knows more about Mary's religious reforms than I ever will.",

It is thoroughly proven that \"Les Dossiers Secrets\", which were the supposed proof of this conspiracy, are a forgery and a hoax. The Prieuré de Sion was founded in 1956 by a French monarchist named Pierre Plantard, who, in 1993 confessed under oath, as an by-the-way in an investigation about financial irregularities and political corruption involving Roger-Patrice Pelat, whom Plantard named one the most recent Grand Master of the Prieuré de Sion, that all was indeed a forgery and hoax. The judge even had the pedanty (which we all can admire), to have all documents in Plantard's Appartement seized and analyzed, which further confirmed the falsehood of Plantard's claims.\n\n&gt; \"All descriptions of artwork, architecture, documents, and secret rituals in this novel are accurate.\"\n\nYeah. Smooth move, Brown. How the hell should anyone debunk your fantasized rituals? Also, no, the documents aren't, as described in the paragraph above.\n\n&gt; Page 3: \"[The dying curator grabs and tears down]... the nearest painting he could see, a Caravaggio.\"\n\nIt's Death of the Virgin, in room 8. The painting is 3,69m * 2,45m, which makes it quite the feat of strength to \"[tear] it from the wall\" in the frame for a seventy-six-year-old. That's just r/badbodyweightfitness.\n\n&gt; \"He [the assassin of the curator] was broad and tall... [and an Albino]\" \n\nCan we get this little non-badhistory-thing out of the way? The sheer idiocy of having an Albino as an assassin? \nHe not only stands out in any crowd like a sore thumb, but is also easily described by witnesses: \"A giant Albino.\" I want to see that police line-up. \"Do you see your murdering giant Albino among this giant Albinos?\"\n\n&gt; Page 5: \"The click of an empty chamber...[prevents the assassin to finish off the curator]\"\n\nMurdering giant Albinos and their one bullet clips (which are magazines). \n\n&gt; \"[The assassin, after his gun made click,] reached for a second clip...\"\n\nThis should be a magazine.

It was a bit of a taboo for a long time in France to call it that. The state only decided in 1999 no longer to speak about \"the operations carried out in Afrique du Nord\" and speak about the war in Algeria.\n\nBy the way, I have just used the word \"curator\" less often than Dan Brown on the first 3 pages.\n\n&gt; Page 9: \"[Robert Langdon's books, including:]...*The Art of the Illuminati*...\"*\n\n/s The Art of the Illuminati, by Robert Langdon: \"The Illuminati like owls and bees. They depict them on their pamphlets and manuals.\"\n\nObviously, the Illuminati liked the owl as a symbol of Minerva. Weishaupt at one point considered calling them \"Orden der Bienen\"- \"Order of the Bees\", which lacks the ominous latin ring that Illuminati has. The Illuminati existed from 1776 to 1785, the books Weishaupt published during that time had no pictures, so no art for the Illuminati.\n\n&gt; Page 16: \"He had forgotten that the seemingly innocuous request...[to give the Hotel his passport, which then is registered by INTERPOL, which is then used in the matter of hours to have the Inspector locate Langdon]\"\n\nHard to believe, but European data privacy laws do not work that way, at least not in regards to INTERPOL. I think the agency Brown describes should be EUROPOL, not INTERPOL. \n\n&gt; Page 17: \"[Langdon musing about France during Paris tour while driving to the crimescene in the Louvre with an Inspector:] Symbologists often remarked that France ... [had a history of] diminutive insecure leaders like Napoleon and Pepin the short... [which they compensated with the Eiffel tower, a] thousand-foot phallus.\"\n\nSeemingly, Symbologists are adolescent smartasses. Napoleon wasn't short. And Pepin and Napoleon certainly weren't insecure. And if the Symbologist ever looked into any city, he would find phallus-like buildings as much as he would please. Don't mind me. The phallus of my city is just not big enough and I'm insecure. \n\n&gt; \"[Langdon's Paris tour continues: The garden of the Tuileries,] Paris's own version of the Central Park.\"\n\nGiven that the Tuileries were opened to the public as a park in 1667, Dan Brown would certainly enjoy\nBabylon's own version of the Central Park, The Hanging Gardens. It's only real when it's comparable to an American counterpart.\n\n&gt; \"[Still Langdon musing about Paris as it goes by his car window:] Most tourist translated Tuileries as relating to the thousands of tulips...\"\n\nThis claim is certainly strange.

That's just r/bad_tourism/.\n\n&gt; Page 20: \"[Langdon still thinks about Paris: Mitterand is] Singlehandedly responsible for filling Paris with Egyptian art ... [so] that the French still refered to him as the Sphinx.\"\n\n/s I remember vividly the day when Mitterand carried the Obelisk on the Place de la Concorde from Luxor to Paris. The pockets of his trousers were turned, and all the small objects in the Egyptian parts of the Louvre fell out. \nIt was a dark and stormy night in the August of 1833. Then, of course, he proceeded to pose riddles to strangers.\n\nJoking aside, Mitterand is known as the Sphinx because he was so enigmatic and secretive. A lot of his actions during the Second World War, for example, are simply not known. He was on the side of Vichy, then somewhen joined the Resistance, got a medal from Vichy France, presumably spied for one side or the other, fled to Algiers, met de Gaulle. Or so he says. Partly. Who knows. \n\nFunny, the in the commentary to page 1 mentioned corruptio-mancer, Pelat was a friend of Mitterand. There must be a conspiracy.",

        "text": "Long time lurker first time poster here ready to actually contribute to the Sub I love so much. The source of my bad history is something I haven’t seen on this sub before; a church sermon. Unfortunately due to the nature of this bad history I cannot directly link the offending piece and we must unfortunately rely on a transcription. \n&gt;”Now the important thing to understand is that the stoics and epicureans were in many senses opposed to each other… the epicureans on the other hand were complete hedonists. Now I don’t mean that as an insult, they were literally hedonists in the classical sense of the word. They didn’t believe in the Greek gods or if they did they didn’t think they were worthy of worship or responsible for creating our world. Left without a divinely inspired meaning for life they took the opposite view of the stoics deciding that pleasure was the chief and only good in this world. Now does that sound familiar? *laughs* They indulged in the pleasures of the flesh with the best wine, the best clothes, the best food, the best everything. Now if I had to sum them up in one phrase it would be “if it feels good do it.” Now like most schools of post Aristotelian philosophy there was a brilliantly describes and intellectual rational for this life style but if I go into that we’ll be here all day *laughs*”\n\nNow unfortunately for me I haven’t stumbled across some rare new breed of historical understanding merely a rehash  of centuries old plan vanilla understanding of how exactly the Epicureans defined hedonism. Hedonism in the classical sense is the belief that pleasure is the sole good to pursue, (so far so good) but pleasure being such a nebulous concept allowed Epicurus to define it in a manner much different then our modern ideas of hedonism would suggest.\nWhile the pastor appears to be describing a philosophical movement comprised entirely of the Hedonismbot from futurama Epicurus instead proposed a life devoted to simple pleasures and indeed defined the simple absences of negative stimuli such as pain, fear, or anxiety as the greatest pleasure. Also important was intellectual stimulation and friendship, this lead logically to the rejection of stereotypically “hedonistic” practices such as over indulgence on wine or rich food. In his own words \n&gt;“I am thrilled with pleasure in the body when I live on bread and water, and I spit on luxurious pleasures, not for their own sake, but because of the inconveniences that follow them”\n\n&gt;” Of all the means which wisdom acquires to ensure happiness throughout the whole of life, by far the most important is friendship”\n\n&gt; “By pleasure we mean the absence of pain in the body and of trouble in the soul. It is not by an unbroken succession of drinking bouts and of revelry, not by sexual lust, nor the enjoyment of fish and other delicacies of a luxurious table, which produce a pleasant life; it is sober reasoning, searching out the grounds of every choice and avoidance, and banishing those beliefs through which the greatest tumults take possession of the soul.”\n\n&gt;” It is impossible to live a pleasant life without living wisely and honorably and justly, and it is impossible to live wisely and honorably and justly without living pleasantly. Whenever any one of these is lacking, when, for instance, the man is not able to live wisely, though he lives honorably and justly, it is impossible for him to live a pleasant life.”\n\nIn the end a simple life spent with family and friends without the pressures of political or civil involvement was seen as the highest good a man could strive for. The life advocated by the Epicureans was a far cry from the constant drunken orgy some people seem to think it was (possibly why they became less popular).\n\nAs I said before this is my first post here so I am positive I have not reached the quality levels you masters of pedantry have.

        "text": "*Downton Abbey* has a very good reputation for historical accuracy in clothing - in part because it makes use of antique clothing in its costume closet - but there are certain areas where the viewer must be cautious instead of taking it as an accurate representation of fashion in the 1910s and 1920s.\n\n[This is Lady Mary in her corset](http://36.media.tumblr.com/b7ff60eeeb3997b797594b5ec410c80c/tumblr_mmwhu4Wjg01rwahceo1_500.jpg), the only shot in the entire show of a female character in her underwear, I believe. At the time, the corset was hailed as accurate, and in some ways it is - the waist is not sharply defined, the color is a kind of beige, and it's on the long side. It struck me as odd that it had straps, but I didn't give it much of a second thought until it came up in a conversation a couple of years later (after I'd done a lot more research in the period on my own), and then I realized how bad it was - and why something about so many of the sisters' costumes had been bothering me in the first two seasons.\n\nThe show starts out in 1912, with the sinking of the Titanic. [Corsets](http://digitalcollections.nypl.org/items/510d47e0-fcf0-a3d9-e040-e00a18064a99) of the [early teens](http://digitalcollections.nypl.org/items/510d47e0-fcbe-a3d9-e040-e00a18064a99) were [indeed](http://digitalcollections.nypl.org/items/510d47e0-fccc-a3d9-e040-e00a18064a99) a bit like this one. One big difference is that they were a *lot* longer than Mary's - the boning usually ended at about mid-hip, making the last foot or so of \"corset\" actually a kind of skirt that smoothed the line under the fitted dresses then in fashion. You can see the ridge of the bottom of the boning in some of the photos of [this glorious number](http://kent.pastperfect-online.com/34506cgi/mweb.exe?request=record;id=F48C678E-F3C6-4258-BC5B-448349622642;type=101). Garter straps were usually attached to the bottom of this skirt as well, and are also not present here.\n\nBut here's the really big difference: look at the top of the corsets in the ads linked above and on Michelle Dockery. Corsets in 1912 *barely* supported the breasts. The top edge of the corset would hit at about mid-bust or even completely below it, and a brassiere would be worn on top for actual support. The fashionable bustline was low, compared to where it is today, exaggerated by [bodices draped with light fabrics](http://digitalcollections.nypl.org/items/510d47e0-ef75-a3d9-e040-e00a18064a99) and a [slight blousing](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/228065168605233955/) that was a remnant of the [more exaggerated puffing](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/228065168605836522/) of the early 1900s - so the support of [an early brassiere](http://digitalcollections.nypl.org/items/510d47e0-ef2e-a3d9-e040-e00a18064a99) was more about holding 'em in place than any kind of lift. Meanwhile, Mary's corset? The upper edge has been given the kind of V-shape you can see in the advertisements linked above, but shifted up several inches - so the \"wings\" press her cleavage into place, aided by the completely anachronistic straps.\n\nWhile this is the only shot of a corset in the show (IIRC), it seems to be a problem endemic to the sisters' costuming. When I look at Dockery, Carmichael, and Findlay-Brown fully dressed, here's always [cleavage](http://dressatdownton.tumblr.com/post/67798384242/downtonabbeyfreak-lets-love-each-other), [uplift](http://i0.wp.com/www.frockflicks.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/DowntonAbbey-season1.jpg), and [oddly flattened busts](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2606870/Jessica-Brown-Findlay-real-reason-left-Downton-Abbey.html) that affect the way the dress looks on their torsos. This has continued to be a problem [going into the 1920s](https://33.media.tumblr.com/147b8722e2fc141386abf46c416142d4/tumblr_ncbkm8zbdU1rvdh8no1_500.gif), where there's [a bit less lift](http://d2buyft38glmwk.cloudfront.net/media/__sized/images/canonical/mast-da-s5-quiz-style-icon-02-1920X1080-scale-800x600.jpg) but still way more curve than would have been desirable to actual women of the day. ([Brassieres of the earlier 1920s](http://m.cdn.blog.hu/tr/trendmano/image/1922-bra-lingerie.jpg) were fairly sturdy and more about flattening the bust into a [smooth line down the front](http://chapmanmuseum.pastperfect-online.com/30796cgi/mweb.exe?request=record;id=836AA742-9D0A-4489-BFA0-830800859842;type=102).)\n\nThis seems like a very small issue (until you start looking for it, and then believe me it stands out to you), but the effect is to make all of the outfits that would otherwise have been pretty decent inaccurate. It's not noticeable at first because this is the bustline everyone expects to see, because it's what's seen as normal and attractive, and even strangely natural, today - it's the mark of presentism branded into every scene. How could we think beautiful actresses were beautiful if they didn't look like they were wearing a push-up bra? *Madness!* Anyway, because modern fashion/lingerie corsets are mostly about giving you power cleavage, doesn't that mean that *all* corsets are about power cleavage?\n\nAnd eventually you start to realize that most movies set during this period of fashionably low busts has this problem. [Rose's corset](http://www.ariacouture.com/image/obj220geo218pg32p8.png) in Titanic, for example, comes way up high to make sure that [her breasts always are, too](http://www.costumersguide.com/dinner/ref29.jpg). And in films set in the later 19th century, when the fashionable look was [low and apart](http://digitalcollections.nypl.org/items/510d47e0-e340-a3d9-e040-e00a18064a99), [that can't be allowed to stand either](http://www.costumersguide.com/imagearchive/picture.php?/2325/category/135).\n\nDo I win an award for the BadHistory posts with the most breasts?",

        "text": "I've been reading Colin Woodward's [American Nations: A History of the Eleven Rival Regional Cultures of North America](http://www.amazon.com/American-Nations-History-Regional-Cultures/dp/0143122029) for the past little while (I tend to read in bursts and to read multiple books at once which means I can sometimes take several weeks to finish something), and I've thoroughly enjoyed it. \n\nHe's mostly been pretty good about his history, though it has been generalized (which is understandable given the task he's set himself). He's also made a point in his discussion of the Deep South slave aristocracy that I thought was quite profound, when he pointed out that in the Deep South the slavers didn't establish a \"class\" system, but instead they established a *caste* system, which is quite a different thing, and that the caste system lasted for  a few hundred years. \n\nAt any rate, I was reading a section about New England settlers who were heading to the frontiers and Woodward spends a few pages talking about how New Englanders were essentially theocratic (true enough), that they tended to move as entire communities (also true), and that the communities they established tended to imitate the communities they'd left behind. \n\nAccording to Woodward \n\n&gt;\"New England produced an unusual number of intense religious personalities--people, in the words of the late historian Frederick Merk, 'eager to get into direct touch with God, to see God in person, to hear His voice from on high.' In the tightly controlled Yankee homeland, mystics and self-declared prophets generally were kept in check, but out on the frontier, the enforcement of orthodoxy was laxer. The result was an explosion of new religions, starting in New York, where religious fervor was so incendiary that people started calling it the 'Burnt-over District'. \n\nThe common factor among these new religions (again according to Woodward) is that \" . . .nearly all of them sought to restore the primitive simplicity of the early Christian faith before it accreted elaborate institutions, a written canon, and a bevy of clerical authorities.\"\n\nAmong these churches Woodward lists the Seventh-Day Adventists, the Noyes Oneida Community, the Mormons, Unitarianism, and an increase in Methodist enrollment.                                                                                                                                                    \n\nThe first thing wrong with this section is his characterization of the  [\"Burned Over District\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burned-over_district). The Burned Over District didn't get it's name because of the \"incendiary religious fervor\", but because there had been so many religious revivals in the area that all the converts had been feared to have been burned over. The phrase was coined by  Charles Grandison Finney as early as 1876 in his autobiography (though he refers to it as \"a burnt district\". \n\nWoodward's comments on Mormonism continue the badhistory (though there's also a smattering of badreligion).\n\nWoodward says:\n\n&gt;\"Joseph Smith and his son were among hundreds of 'divining men' who claimed special abilities to find buried treasures and dispel the charms protecting them, services they were paid in advance to perform.\"\n\nUnfortunately for Woodward there are no contemporary accounts which corroborate the idea of Smith Sr (or Jr) ever using \"seer stones\" in this way. There's an account published in *Fraser Magazine* in 1873 which is supposedly a court transcript of a lawsuit brought against Smith Jr., in 1826 for being a \"disorderly person\" (basically for claiming to have mystical powers and not having them). The issue, of course, is that the account was published 33 years after Smith's assassination/murder. \n\nJoseph Smith Jr, did reportedly use seer stones (or something similar to them) at times when he was translating the Book of Mormon, and the idea of magical divination for buried treasure certainly wasn't unusual in that period of time, so it's quite possible that Smith Jr. was part of that scene--but there's no conclusive proof, other than that 1873 transcript. \n\nJoseph Smith, Jr. did admit that he was hired to dig for an abandoned silver mine by a man named Joseph Stowell (it was Stowell's nephew who is supposed to have brought the suit against Smith), but again that's the closest we come to the idea of Joseph Smith, Jr. being a mystically guided treasure hunter. \n\nWoodward's then goes on to say\n\n&gt;\"After being arrested for defrauding his clients, Joseph Smith Jr. found a set of golden plates in a hillside in Manchester, NY).\"\n\nThe first arrest record for Joseph Smith, Jr. that we have record for is the 1826 record for being a \"disorderly person\". According to Smith's own account he first discovered the plates which became the Book of Mormon in 1823, but wasn't allowed to bring them home and translate them until 1827. \n\nMaybe Woodward meant that Joseph Smith Jr. was arrested for fraud before he brought the plates home. However, the next arrest (after the 1826 one) was not until 1830, when he was again arrested for \"being a disorderly person\", acquitted, then arrested immediately again on the same charge (and acquitted again). \n\nThe Book of Mormon was published March 26, 1830 (the 1830 arrest for \"being a disorderly person\" was June 30, 1830), and it's hard to escape the conclusion that the June arrest was a direct result of the publication of the Book of Mormon.\n\nIn fact, Joseph Smith Jr, wouldn't be charged with fraud until the collapse of the [Kirtland Safety Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirtland_Safety_Society) a bank that was established on January 2, 1837 by the leaders of the Mormon Church with the stated intention of providing financial services to Mormons who might not be able to get them at other banks, and which collapsed in November 1837. \n\nWoodward then says that the Book of Mormon teaches that\n\n&gt;\"Jesus would return to Independence, Missouri\". \n\nThis is more badreligion than badhistory, but I'll toss it in here anyway. The Book of Mormon makes no such claim. Early Mormonism did teach that the Garden of Eden (or at least the area where Adam &amp; Eve lived after being driven from the Garden) is located in Daviess County, Missouri at a place the Mormons named [Adam-ondi-Ahman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam-ondi-Ahman), but that location is on a bend of the Grand River and is close to 100 miles from Independence.\n\nMormons do teach that Christ will visit America when the world ends, but they don't specify where (presumably the tour will include SLC), or if it'll only be one time only show.\n\nWoodward's next statement\n\n&gt;\"Tens of thousands were drawn to his polygamous millennial kingdom in Nauvoo, Illinois, which tried to secede from the state to become a separate U.S. territory.\"\n\nMy issue here is the conflating of timelines. Woodward makes it seem as if polygamy was the main force behind new converts. Polygamy wasn't established as official Mormon doctrine until 1843 (though Smith and other leaders had been practicing it earlier), barely a year before he and his brother Hyrum were killed by a mob while imprisoned at Carthage jail. By that point the population of Nauvoo was ~10,000 to 12,000 (in an 1843 letter to Congress Smith and other Mormon leaders claim up to 16,000 fled Missouri) making it one of the largest cities in Illinois. While the Mormon church certainly had large numbers of converts in Nauvoo, they weren't at the tens of thousands of converts stage yet. That would happen after they moved to Salt Lake City. \n\nIt is true that the leaders of Nauvoo (Smith among them) did petition the US Congress to grant them territorial status. However, this was less about a desire to be a separate government and more about seeking federal protection against armed mobs and state militias intent on doing them violence. They had sent several petitions to Congress asking for protection/help/redress, and were basically told \"Sorry, we can't deal with an internal state matter.\" Applying for territorial status would mean that Nauvoo would be a federal district (a la Washington D.C.), and would thus be able to directly petition Congress and the President for help, and the President could act without Congressional approval. \n\nThe application was made on December 21, 1843. There are scans of one petition from Mormon leaders at the National Archives [here](http://www.archives.gov/legislative/guide/senate/chapter-13-judiciary.html). \n\nIn checking on Woodward's source for the information on Mormons (and the other religions), it looks as if he relied solely on Kevin Phillips' *American Theocracy*, which I haven't read yet. I thoroughly enjoyed Phillip's *1775: A Good Year for Revolution*, and highly recommend it, but I haven't read anything else by Phillip to know if he's consistently good or not. One major flaw with Phillips is that he doesn't do original research on his books. He'll read hundreds of books about his main subject and related subject and then pull together a cohesive narrative, but he doesn't delve into the primary sources, which can be a problem. \n\nSome good books about Joseph Smith worth reading\n\n[*Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling*](http://www.amazon.com/Joseph-Smith-Rough-Stone-Rolling-ebook/dp/B000XUBEZM) by Richard Bushman\n\n[*American Crucifixion: The Murder of Joseph Smith and the Fate of the Mormon Church*](http://www.amazon.com/American-Crucifixion-Murder-Joseph-Mormon-ebook/dp/B00GL9TP0K) by Alex Beam\n\nThe title of the post comes from a fairly well-known \"biography\" of Smith called \"No Man Knows My History\" written by Fawn Brodie and published in 1945. To be kind, it's a not very rigorous study of the life of Joseph Smith. \n\nAlso I still recommend *American Nations* to anybody interested in looking at the cultural history of N.A.",

My primary occupation is in IT, but I dabble in history because I think to understand who you are, you have to know where you come from.  Part of that is because I don't know exactly **where** my family line comes from; my paternal ancestors, the ones who gave me my last name, peter out in northern Tennessee in the 1870s, and there's only vague supposition and family oral legend about how we ended up with our last name. Predictably, it contains crime, intrigue, and illegitimate children, and might be 100% complete bullshit.

        "text": "**OR, WHY PRESIDENT WILSON MAY HAVE BEEN A DICK BUT WAS NOT A DICK FOR THE REASONS THIS GUY THINKS HE WAS**\n\n[Link here](http://nationalinterest.org/feature/americas-worst-president-ever-13002), relevant stuff in page 2.\n\n&gt;Which brings us to Woodrow Wilson, whose failures of commission probably had the most dire consequences of any U.S. president. His great flaw was his sanctimonious nature, more stark and distilled than that of any other president, even John Quincy Adams (who was no piker in the sanctimony department). He thought he always knew best, because he thought he knew more than anybody else. Combine that with a powerful humanitarian sensibility, and you get a president who wants to change the world for the betterment of mankind. Watch out for such leaders.\n\nI'm with him so far, even if I don't agree with it. This is mostly because this is mostly interpretative and subjective rather than factual. It's hard to argue that idealistic leaders as a group are less dangerous than cynical self-serving poll chasers but who the hell *wants* their leaders to be cynical self-serving poll chasers? USA would still have slavery (and/or be part of the British Empire or Commonwealth) if it wasn't for idealistic leaders.\n\n&gt;Even during his first term, with war raging in Europe, he sought to get the United States involved as a neutral mediator, fostering a peace agreement to break the tragic stalemate that had the nations of Europe in its grip. When that effort was rebuffed, he ran for reelection by hailing himself as the man who kept the United States out of the war.\n\nOversimplifying but OK I guess?\n\n&gt;But, immediately upon entering his second term, he sought to get his country into the war by manipulating neutrality policy. While proclaiming U.S. neutrality, he favored Britain by observing the British blockade of Germany (imposed, said a young Winston Churchill, to starve Germans, including German infants, into submission) and by allowing armed British merchant ships entry to U.S. ports, which in turn fostered a flow of U.S. munitions to the Allied powers. At the same time, Wilson declared that Germany would be held to a “strict accountability” for any American loss of life or property from Germany’s submarine attacks. This policy applied, said Wilson, even if affected Americans traveling or working on British or French ships. He declined to curtail what he considered Americans’ “right” to travel on vessels tied to France or Britain (but not Germany).\n\nHAH! \n\nTo accept this version of history we have to ignore a metric fuckton of German provocation as well as enormous substantive differences between the (legally slightly iffy) cruiser \"far blockade\" as implemented by the Royal Navy and the *completely illegal* submarine warfare as used by the Kaiserliche Marine. And let's gloss over the whole issue of, you know, actual responsibility for the war, because this guy gives me the impression he's ready to blame Belgium for wearing a short skirt.\n\n&gt;Wilson was warned, most notably by his secretary of state, William Jennings Bryan, that these lopsided policies inevitably would pull America into the war. When he ignored those warnings, Bryan resigned from the Wilson cabinet on a stand of principle.\n\nOkay, but let's not forget that WJB was also a notorious populist and bimetallist kook who was already frustrated to hell by Wilson's more mainstream policies. This isn't a Great Man resigning over a matter of principle, exactly.\n\n&gt;As Bryan predicted, America did get pulled into the conflict, and it certainly appears that that was Wilson’s intention all along. Then three things happened.\n\nI'm pretty sure the mainstream view is that Wilson was more or less *forced* to escalate things by continuous German provocation, eventually resulting in the declaration of war.\n\n&gt;First, Wilson conducted the war in ways that devastated the home front. Prices shot up into double digits, and then came a potent economic recession that lasted three years. He accepted the suppression of civil liberties by his notorious attorney general, A. Mitchell Palmer. His government nationalized many private industries, including the telegraph, telephone and railroad industries, along with the distribution of coal. Race riots erupted in numerous cities that claimed nearly 150 lives in two years.\n\nOkay, he could have handled things better. Wilson did put some arguably unnecessary limits on personal freedom and privacy, something hardly unknown for war Presidents before or since. The whining about nationalization just reeks of /r/Libertarian though (is he seriously complaining about nationalizing German-owned industries while the USA is literally at war with Germany?). The race riots were definitely something we should condemn the Wilson Presidency for (Wilson was a notable racist who segregated the Federal Civil Service, among other things), but it's hard to pin the blame for those on his *war* policies.\n\n&gt;Second, America’s entry into the war broke the stalemate, allowing the Allied powers to impose upon Germany devastating armistice terms. \n\nWow, okay. Let's assume that the US entry did in fact \"break the stalemate\" (it didn't) and that the Allies imposed \"devastating\" terms on Germany (they didn't, either). This is a bad thing? (It isn't).\n\n&gt;Third, when Wilson went to the Versailles peace conference bent on bringing to bear his humanitarian outlook and making the world safe for democracy, he promptly got outmaneuvered by the canny nationalist leaders of Britain and France, whose agenda had nothing to do with Wilson’s dreamy notions about a harmonious world born of his humanitarian vision.\n\nOh, crap. Talk about half-truths. Wilson and his team of bright young not-professional-diplomats did in fact get outmaneuvered and exploited all over the place by David Lloyd George and *his* team (the French, not so much), notably when it came to assigning territories from the Ottoman Empire. What they did manage to do was impose much less onerous conditions on Germany, conditions which (maybe) could have prevented Germany coming back for Round 2. It's hard to know contrafactuals but I do know this: The conditions imposed on Germany could have (and arguably should have) been much worse.\n\n&gt;The result was a humiliation of Germany that rendered another war nearly inevitable and created in that country a sump of civic resentment and venom that would poison its politics for a generation. We can’t say with certainty that Adolf Hitler wouldn’t have emerged in Germany if the stalemate of World War I had been settled through negotiations rather than diktat. But we can say that the world spawned by Wilson’s naïve war policies certainly created a political climate in Germany that paved the way for Hitler.\n\nBlah blah blah, Versailles = Hitler. I'm not going to dignify this shit with a retort.\n\n&gt;That’s a big load for Wilson to carry through history, though the academic polls consistently rank him quite favorably. That’s probably because most academics are progressives who like Wilson for his own progressive sentiments. But the two Roosevelts also were progressives and left the country better off when they left office. Such a case can’t be made for Wilson, who left the country in shambles. The 1920 Republican victories in the presidential and congressional elections constituted of the greatest political repudiations in U.S. history. Thus, Wilson’s failures of commission render him, arguably, the worst president in American history.\n\nWilson might have been a \"progressive\" but he certainly wasn't a progressive we'd recognize as such. On the vital issue of race he was an example of the period reactionary \"Southern Gentleman\" variety of racist. Certainly his Presidency's policies and effects on race relations would shape his reputation far more than they have if they were not overshadowed by his role in WW1.\n\nFar more likely, the reason Wilson is admired in academia (in those corners of academia where he is admired, insofar as he is admired) is that he nourished and exercised USA's ability to project power and influence beyond its own \"back yard.\" Pre-Wilson, USA was not notably stronger or more influential than several other powers. Post-Wilson, she was the premier power and on her way to becoming a superpower.\n\nWilson's espoused principles of national self-determination, international cooperation etc. have also informed international policy and influenced the way we think about nations in ways that are hard to overstate. We have become so accustomed to shaping our ideas about nation-states along ethnic lines (with decidedly mixed results) that it is hard to think about them differently. These were not Wilson originals, but the \"Wilsonian Principles\" associated with his Fourteen Points continue to shape USA's foreign policy.",

BHOP (Bad History OP) over on IO9 has [Filed to Science History, Indeed](http://io9.com/how-a-pharmacist-named-f-c-achard-doomed-us-all-1733728908) wherein OP credits F.C. Achard and the Prussians for sugar and sugar refining....in 1798. It's bad history because \nit in a nutshell says \n\n&gt; One present to the King of Prussia launched an industry that, if current experts are to be believed, will kill us all. \n\nImplying throughout the article that that was the first refined sugar ever,\n\n&gt;And that’s how the world’s first sugar refinery came into being. \n\nand that the 1798-1802 Sugar factory that was started as a result of Archard's furtherance of Marggraf's beet sugar experiments was the first sugar refinery ever. \n\nThe Dutch, who had the market in sugar refining on the continent since the 17th century's beginning, would be amused, and horrified by this. \n\n&gt;The powder was difficult to distill, would take a hundred pounds of raw material to make three pounds of product, but both the King and Achard knew that, human nature being what it was, there would be a market for it and damn the cost. The King gave Achard the starter money for a factory.\n\nThis implies that they were taking some kind of risk. On sugar. \nWhat they were doing in 1798 was getting sugar from beets. That was new and important. But refining sugar was not. Not at all. The European Sugar Boom had been in swing since the 17th century using cane sugar from the Caribbean. And before that the history of sugar goes back centuries.  \n\nBarbara Solow, late of Harvard's WEB Dubois Research Institute wrote in 2014 in \"Capitalism and Slavery in the Exceedingly Long Run\" that \n\n&gt; From its origins in the South Pacific, sugar spread to the Southeast Asia and India and was brought to the West by the Arabs in the Muslim era. In the late Sassanid period the southeastern region of Mesopotamia (Khuzistan) was the most important sugar procuing regionm anbd sugar spread with Islam, appearing next in Egypt. From the Muslim Era, sugar and slavery were associated. \n\nThat's from Page 2. Sugar is old.

And Prussia.\n\nWhere I live Prussian bashing is a weekend family activity. But let's bash them for something they did. \n\nThis is bad history because Sugar is old. Much older than Beet Sugar or Prussia. And the Article implies that this 1798 factory was the very beginning, as opposed to an important development in an already thousand year old story.  \n",

        "text": "So [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TumblrInAction/comments/3mypsz/moshing_is_ableist/cvjh2el) popped up. I'm not really sure WHY it's there, it seems to be a random copypasta. And thankfully it is a copypasta, but I find that its worthy of tearing down. \n\n&gt;(R)ussian history starts when the Eastern Slavs and Finno-Ugric peoples start to settle down and establish a state, and they open relations with the Byzantines and adopt Christianity.\n\nSo not exactly. The mythical founding year  of Rus (which I don't really consider to be 'Russia') is 862. Rus converted to Orthodox Christianity in the 980s. The myth behind Rurik though says that he was a Varangian, who were more Scandinavian than Finno-Ugric. The foundation myth also says that the local Slavs asked the Varangians to 'please please be our overlords'.  I'm skeptical about that, but since it's just a myth, it can slide. \n\n\n&gt;Genghis came (in the winter, mind you) and in less than three years, the Mongols completely destroyed the young state of Rus', killing over half it's people.\n\nRus' (again, not Russia) was not really a united state, not the way modern people understand it at least. In some ways it reminds me, a bit, of the Holy Roman Empire - there were semi-independent principalities, tied to a central authority (whose rule was not absolute) and held together (at times) be religion and language. Over a 3 year campaign, would it really matter if the Mongols kicked things off in the winter? Also, Mongolia and the Central Asian steppes aren't exactly known for being Warm and Tropical. \n\n&gt;The Mongol Empire collapsed, leaving a power void in Asia. Russia reestablished itself as the Grand Duchy, and then the Tsardom, but it took a very long time before Russia could be considered a regional power.\n\nMOSCOW was a Grand Duchy. It existed as a sub-unit of Kievan Rus'. Nor did the Mongol empire collapse all at once. It was a nice slow process that (surprise) led to things like the Grand Duchy of Moscow becoming a regional power. Also, I take issue with the wording 'Russia re-established itself'. Russia had never established itself in the first place, re-establishment seems to be quite a stretch. \n\n&gt;In the age of Empire, Russia, with no warm water ports, could not expand across the seas, and was blocked by powerful Germany/HRE/Austria in the West, so they expanded East, and the more they expanded, the more clear it was that Russia was forming an identity for itself that was somehow different from the rest of Europe. As the empire grew, it also grew more isolated. They fell behind, economically and socially. Feudalism in the form of lords and serfs existed in Russia until 1861, but when it was abolished, it only made the lower classes even poorer. In 1906 a constitution was written, but the Aristocracy rejected it.\n\nWow....So first of all, the fact that all the time between ~ 1500-1780(90) gets really glossed over really bugs me. Lots of stuff happened, including Mikhail Romanov (a slow reformer), Peter the First's (Great) reforms (not a slow reformer), and (depending on when we put the start time of 'the Age of Empire') people like Catherine the Great, the Napoleonic Wars and the Decembrist Revolt. Its really tough to say 'here's a history of Russia' and leave all that stuff out, not to mention the stuff that **I've** left out for brevity's sake. \n\nAs far as the 3 blocking powers to the West - First of all, no mention of the Ottomans, the Russian Empire's constant foil and enemy? Ok fine, sure. Because the Russian Empire certainly went to war against the HRE, Germany, and Austria-Hungary a lot....\nLet's not even mention that Germany and the HRE aren't even close to being the same thing...\n\nMoving on we find that Serfdom in Russia existed until 1861. Shockingly, it was more or less chattel slavery, it was just called something else. \n\nI am particularly enraged by the 'abolishing serfdom made the lower classes poorer'. Yes, that's almost exactly what happens when in exchange for 'no more serfdom' you saddle people who had nothing with a huge, inheritable debt.  I'm going to post in the thread a chapter from Pytor Krapotkin's *Memoirs of a Revolutionist*. He certainly had an ax to grind, but Russian Serfdom wasn't some kind of blissful existence. \n\n&gt;World War 1 began. It was kind of Russia's fault, they were the first to mobilize their military (well, they somehow managed to sneak around using the word \"mobilize\" so that after the war they could point the finger at Germany, who mobilized in response to Russia's \"totally-not-a-mobilization\") Russia was not ready for the war, the people didn't want the war, they had no stake in the squabbles of Balkan powers,\n\nSo the idea of War Guilt has been covered by others who are much more well versed in such things. Russia had plenty at stake (from their perspective) in the Balkan powers. As much at least as Germany did. It seems strange to modern eye, but back then not so much. \n\n&gt;And then things got worse.\nRevolution! The Tsars were kicked out in March of 1917, and were replaced by the Russian Republic.\n\nI've never seen how Nicholas II's abdication (not getting kicked out) and the establishment of the Russian Republic would make things worse (FYI between the passages, the refrain 'and then things got worse' is repeated. On top of all the badhistory, it's also Whig Bad History).\n\n&gt;Revolution! The Russian Republic was kicked out by the Bolsheviks in the Red October, establishing the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, led by Vladmir Lenin. They made peace with the Germans and Austrians, and consolidated power for the next several years, socializing every business they possibly could, and then forming the USSR.\n\nWe're not going to talk about the Civil War? Arguably, yes that DOES make everything worse, but since it's actually a pointable \"wow things really got worse\" moment bit...it's totally glossed over. Sorry Admirals Denikin and Kolchak, you've been written out of history. \n\nAnyhow, very early in Soviet History, Lenin reversed course and started NEP, which was quite successful. It was later reversed by Stalin - but for the time it was in NEP was quite capitalist in its nature. \n\nSo I'm going to stop here. The other stuff, well it's bad World War II history, glosses over lots of important parts about glasnost or will just come close to being out and out Rule 2 violations. \n\nSources you say? Here's a few: \n[A History of Russia : 8th Edition](http://www.amazon.com/A-History-Russia-Nicholas-Riasanovsky/dp/019534197X) whihc was a constant companion for a few years.\n\n[Memoirs of a Revolutionist](http://www.amazon.com/Memoirs-Revolutionist-History-Political-Science-ebook/dp/B00JFD9AM2/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1443664709&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=memoirs+of+a+revolutionist) which is a great look at Russia in the 19th century, from the point of view of an upper class man trying to overthrow the system. \n\n\n",

        "text": "So, there is a conversation involving someone from the AskHistorians mod team and the BadHistory subreddit that is long overdue. It’s been delayed for a number of reasons, but recent matters involving BadHistory have rather brought this to a point, and to the point where I personally felt like it should be done in the open. I am primarily speaking here as me, a specific moderator of AskHistorians with my own particular opinions, and on the occasions where I speak with confidence of the AH mod team’s general opinion I’ll say so. I am not the Mysterons.\n\nI’ll start by giving my extremely brief summary of how BH’s history has appeared from my point of view. It was first founded by AskHistorians flairs, its earliest community was almost entirely AskHistorians flairs, and it was intended as a light hearted circlejerk. This lasted for as long as it took meta communities on reddit to encounter it, and until several common strains/topics began to clearly dominate. These topics mostly involved people being utter jackasses and using incredibly poor history as their justification, often politically, and often linked to outright bigotry. BH became even more circlejerky, incredibly smug, and intensely bitter. I still feel that this was partially caused because of the parade of awful humans who provided most BH-worthy content. A decent number of the older BH members started to leave the subreddit, including some of its earlier mods. \n\nThen, new moderators having been added, things started to change. A lot of people grumbled but the subreddit was slowly pulled away from the same topic every 5 minutes, from total circlejerk, and towards having some kind of educational platform. An IRC had emerged as a result of r/badsubhub being formed, and though it still carries that name the IRC has always been primarily composed of BH users, and is effectively the BH IRC channel. The subreddit started to get large effort posts aimed at education more than entertainment, some of which were unwieldy and probably quite boring like mine, and others of which were interesting and insightful. From my point of view the community became palpably nicer to deal with, and was consistently improving. But part of the reason that I’m making this post is that, bit by bit, it feels like BH is actually starting to become more toxic again, and rather rapidly.\n\nNow I need to say something that sounds rather insulting; almost all of the AskHistorians moderators can’t stand the BH subreddit. This has been the case for years in some cases. Their individual reasons for dislike have always differed. Some just don’t like any kind of circlejerky community. But the common thread has always been that most AH mods associate BadHistory with that original period of incredibly toxic, bitter discourse, and they continue to see behaviour that they find incredibly smug. This is not simply a case of looking at a community with a lot of AH flairs and disapproving, this is because the crossover between the two subreddits has not always functioned positively. Some of the attitudes of that earlier toxic phase of BH found their way into the actions of some of our flaired users and commenters in AskHistorians at the time, and this is where many of our mods developed such a serious dislike of BadHistory from; it seemed to keep producing smug, cynical commenters who went to AskHistorians to try to be mean to people, not in order to help them learn. Whilst I agreed with these problems I still felt that BH had enormous potential, especially for education, which is why I’ve made such long and boring posts from time to time, and I’ve already established that I felt the subreddit improved enormously with time and care. But matters of late have left me wondering whether I was wrong, and uncomfortable with trying to justify my better opinion of BadHistory, and that’s because history is beginning to repeat.\n\nI will be blunt once again, negative (and at times unacceptable) behaviour in BH is starting to overlap with behaviour in the AskHistorians community. It’s almost inevitable that this would be the case if toxicity in BH begins to rise again because the links between our communities continue to be very strong. Many new flaired users over the past year have come to AskHistorians via BadHistory, and many longstanding flaired users are regular participants of the BH community, myself included if we’re fair. It’s even more inevitable if this involves incidents between multiple users who are all already flaired on AskHistorians. This has happened before and it is beginning to happen more frequently. \n\n‘Negative behaviour’, you might say, ‘that’s an incredibly ambiguous label’. Indeed it is, and so I’ll be very precise about what I mean; using IRCs linked to BadHistory or AskHistorians as an environment to engage in stupid behaviour, to insult people, as places to circlejerk about how awful a person or their pieces of content are; catty, hostile, and obnoxious behaviour towards BadHistory moderators, including when those moderators are calling people out for poor behaviour in the BH subreddit; the formation of obnoxious, quasi-circlejerk cliques who displace other discussion with exactly the same kind of childish put downs or tired memes every single time; at times people have resorted to open insults on BadHistory threads, where they can squeeze them around BH’s ruleset. The past toxic environment of BH put off more than a few people from ever visiting the subreddit again, and this recent run is beginning to do the same. It has once again helped encourage BH moderators to resign. The behaviour of individuals on the BH affiliated IRC channel has caused regular users there to leave and never come back. This has now also started happening on the AskHistorians IRC channel (which is only accessible for flaired users, sorry for anyone who tried to find it and was disappointed), and this is essentially a final straw for the AH mod team, and why I am talking partially for all of us rather than just as a private, concerned individual. These all disproportionately involve people and flaired users involved with BadHistory, which is why there is not an equivalent meta post in AskHistorians right now.\n\nThis post is mainly intended as a plea, to the subreddit as a whole, to avoid slipping back into past niches and tone. BadHistory has produced an abundance of good quality educational content in the past year and a half, and a lot of genuinely fun and light-spirited content as well. I still feel that BadHistory is better than it was, and that it can be better still, to the point where anyone accusing it of being toxic would feel extremely silly. However, if the situation deteriorates badly then I can’t say which other regulars (with their content and wit) are going to permanently depart the community, and that’s not a threat, that’s a worry.\n\nThis post is also, however, a warning. There is an inherent awkwardness in two communities sharing so many users, to the point where flair in AH has been displayed on BH usernames for over a year, when both subreddits do not share the same rulesets. Neither are the IRCs affiliated with each subreddit ones that have identical rulesets to the subreddits in question, and moderating a crossover between those two is even more awkward in the far less open lands of IRC clients. The AH mod team does not punish people for breaking rules on unrelated subreddits if they are model citizens in our own and there is no question of ill-intent. There is, however, one enormous exception to this principle, and that is where people are abusing their status on our own subreddit in other communities, or where they are deriving authority/prestige on that community by openly displaying their flaired status on AskHistorians. Flair on AskHistorians is no longer displayed on BH but much behaviour has happened under that aegis while it was there. Likewise, given how close our communities are, is BH truly an unaffiliated subreddit? I’m not so sure about that. So what exactly am I warning about? Breaking BH rules might not lead to any raised eyebrows on the AH mod team per se, neither will people be monitoring the every move of our flaired users on BH, but you had better believe that if AH flaired users do something extraordinarily stupid, offensive, or nasty that it will have consequences elsewhere. How could it not? We have also resorted to revoking the flair of those who are absolute asshats on the AH IRC before now, and if necessary we will have to start doing so again. *BadHistory is no longer a consequence free area for AskHistorians flairs looking to be dicks, and IRC is not a staging ground for co-ordinating dickery on reddit*. If we have to start subjectively removing people from things because we feel they are a fundamentally unpleasant person then that is what will have to happen.\n",

        "text": "(Looks at last submission) *Four Days Ago*. \"Yeah, that's more than enough time.\"\n\nIn my quest ~~for sweet, sweet, karma~~ to attack reddit-based WWI Badhistory, the search function has thus far turned up little more worthy of note. I can only hope, as Field Marshall Sir William 'Wully' Robertson did at the end of 1917, that \"the worst is behind us, and I think the best is yet to come.\" *Knocks on wood, throws salt over shoulder, sacrifices newborns to Ba'al/Volcano*\n\n[To the post in question] (https://np.reddit.com/r/history/comments/10o5d0/this_was_a_hit_in_rnosleep_a_while_back_i_think/?). \n\nFocusing on the infamous 'mud of Passchendaele', the OP takes their quotes and cues, as they mention, from Adam Hochschild's (execrable) book *To End All Wars: A Story of Loyalty and Rebellion*; the author in question did a NY Times Op Ed in 2014, distilling some his and his book's takes on the First World War, which I destroyed [here] (https://np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/3k0oza/wwi_centenary_nyt_op_ed_from_one_year_back/). The book itself is worthy of a Bad history series (*he said inconspicuously while his eyes darted to his book case*). A quote from the OP sums up the book nicely:\n\n&gt; Hochschild follows the lives of several families who were torn by the war, with *opponents* pitted *against their family members* **who were very much in favor of continuing the inter-imperial slaughter**\n\nIf you opposed the war in any way for any reason, you may have flaws, but you're a good person, and moreover, right. If you supported your country's war effort in any way, or entertained the belief that there were major ideals, interests and causes at stake, then you are either a mass-murdering, cackling aristocrat (ie Haig), a foaming-at-the-mouth propagandist (and racist; see Rudyard Kipling, John Buchan), or were a misguided, naïve sheep (possibly a rube; see much of the civilian population of Europe).\n\nBut on to the main course: what does it say about the Third Battle of Ypres, fought between July 31st and November 10th, 1917? As one could guess, everything and nothing.\n\n&gt; This was a brutal battle, typical of WW I battles\n\nThe 'typical WWI battle' being neatly summed up in my [submission of four days ago] (https://np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/3meql1/strap_in_the_kids_and_head_out_to_the_badhistory/), ie 'Mud, Blood and Futility'. \n\n&gt; Here, British Empire troops (including Britons, Indians, and Canadians) launched an assault against the German lines beginning July 17, 1917\n\nThe 3rd Battle of Ypres began July 31st, with the Battle of Pilckem Ridge; the preliminary artillery bombardment began on the 17th; the preliminary operation, the capture of the Messines-Wytschaete Ridge took place on June 7th. I would also be remiss if I did not mention the Canadian Corps operations around Hill 70 further south, from August 15th-25th, which were meant to support the battles around Ypres. The troops involved at 3rd Ypres came from Great Britain, Ireland, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and Newfoundland.\n\nNot so bad you might say, but then:\n\n&gt; While the battle was scheduled to be only a few days, it turned into several months\n\nNo it was not; Hubert Gough, GOC 5th Army who was charged with the offensive from July 31st to the end of August, fully expected an operation of a couple months, before even the possibility of a 'breakthrough' might appear. Even if the initial advance at Pilckem Ridge had reached the furthest objectives, the Red Line, the advance would have still been within the German *Wotan* defense line; after that was *Albrecht*, *Flandern I*, *Flandern II* and *Flandern III*. His plan was to replicate the large initial 'bite' achieved by 3rd Army at Arras in April, and then follow up with consecutive, slightly smaller 'bites', which had not been done after the initial successes in 3rd Army's offensive. \n\n&gt;  If all went well, they would push the Germans back and regain Belgian territory\n\nIf all went well, the British would have worn down the enemy's forces and captured the high ground of the Gheluvelt Plateau and the Passchendaele-Staden Ridge. A breakthrough, supported by amphibious operations (Operation *Hush*) was **an** objective, one that would rely on the fulfilment of the latter objective. It's also worth noting that this very nearly happened; when operations switched over to Herbert Plumer's 2nd Army, a series of much smaller 'bites' at Polygon Wood, Menin Road Ridge, and Broodseinde (the latter dubbed *A Black Day for the German Army* by Ludendorff) had the German army group commander, Crown Prince Rupprecht of Bavaria, and Erich Ludendorff planning a retreat to the Dutch Frontier. Until the weather broke in the second week of October, the Germans were faced with disaster.\n\n&gt; Both sides had used this technique in battles farther to the south\n\nHere is a good time to point out how really 'untypical' 3rd Ypres was as a battle. For the first time on the Western Front, the British were taking on the Germany Army alone. Aside from the 6 divisions of the so-called 'French First Army', 50 British and Commonwealth divisions from the BEF fought in the campaign, compared with c. 77-86 German. The Somme had been a joint Franco-British effort, Arras had been a distraction for the French Nivelle Offensive. Now, with the French temporarily out of commission due to the [Mutinies] (https://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/350akm/how_serious_were_the_mutinies_and_morale_problem/), and Russia steadily beginning it's downward spiral, the BEF found itself in a position in 1917 not unlike that of the French in 1915 on the Western Front.\n\nThat said, as Andy Simpson has demonstrated in his work on BEF Corps in WWI (discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1349874/1/367588.pdf), the BEF's fighting methods were actually incredibly sophisticated in the battle, based off of rigorous application of lessons learned in operations since the Somme. As Jack Sheldon has noted in his work on the German Army, German Elastic Defence-In-Depth proved a tough nut to crack, and was constantly adjusted to match British methods. It was also a battle of ['semi-positional'/'semi-open' warfare] (https://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/3dxlav/what_were_the_conditions_during_ww1_in_the/ct9udmc), **not the trenches**; by all accounts, measured against popular 'understanding' of the war, the 3rd Battle of Ypres may be about as 'untypical' as they come!\n\n**Continued**",

        "text": "To complete the hat trick before an expected moratorium on music history, I now present a third song off the Highwaymen's debut album \"Highwaymen\".\n\nThis song specifically deals with history, as the title \"The Twentieth Century is Almost Over\" would indicate.  Steve Goodman and John Prine wrote it; Goodman was best known for the legendary folk song \"City of New Orleans\", brought to fame by Arlo Guthrie and then Willie Nelson.  As has been the case with the other two songs reviewed, The Highwaymen simply changed lyrics and the tune as they saw fit.   In this case, the omitted lyrics contribute only to the tune and not to the history, so those won't be covered.\n \nThis song is a light nostalgic look at the 20th century.  This particular song is covered by Nelson and Johnny Cash.\n\nSince we've all been introduced to the group in previous analyses, let's begin.\n\nWillie Nelson starts off:\n\n&gt;Back in 1899\n\n&gt;Everybody sang \"Auld Lang Syne\"\n\n&gt;A hundred years would take a long long time,\n\n&gt;For every little boy and girl\n\n&gt;Now there's just one thing I would like to know,\n\n&gt;Where did the twentieth century go?\n\n&gt;I swear it was there just a minute ago, all over this world\n\nAuld Lang Syne was originally penned in 1788 and became a standard song for New Year's.  Although I should point out that not everybody sang it in 1899, that's getting excessively pedantic even by my standards.\n\nNelson and Johnny Cash then cover the refrain:\n\n&gt;All over this world\n\n&gt;All over this world\n\n&gt;The twentieth century is almost over\n\n&gt;All over this world\n\nThen it's Johnny Cash solo:\n\n&gt;Does anybody recall the Great Depression?\n\n&gt;I read all about it in the True Confession\n\n&gt;Sorry I was late for the recording session,\n\n&gt;Somebody put me on hold\n\n&gt;Did anybody see them linoleum floors, petroleum jelly, and two world wars?\n\n&gt;They went 'round in revolving doors, all over this world\n\nThe Great Depression began in 1929 and lasted for around a decade.  \"The True Confession\" refers to a single issue of \"True Confessions\", which began publication in 1922.\n\n\"Recording session\" starts to get a bit shaky.  Although studio recording sessions really began to peak in the 1920s, the practice had been going on since at least 1890.  It was extremely primitive and the quality was poor, but it was still a recording session.  Several good photographs involving the setup of these early sessions can be seen [here](http://www.tinfoil.com/record.htm).\n\nNow, as a fan of early country and bluegrass, I'm at risk of rambling off on a tangent about the famous Bristol sessions.  These sessions took place in 1927 and introduced the country to the last type of popular music that hadn't taken off commercially yet (country, bluegrass, Appalachian folk music, and country gospel; all grouped into \"hillbilly music\").  Trust me, I'm restraining myself, especially since I have Jimmie Rodgers on in the background while typing this.\n\n\"Wait!\", you may think.  \"This type of music WAS popular before Bristol!  Vernon Dalhart had a huge hit with 'Wreck of the Old 97' and 'The Prisoner's Song', which were recorded in 1924!  And the Bristol sessions were a response to this, since it was obviously a case of Ralph Peer trying to replicate Dalhart's success!\"  Well, maybe.  Yes, Dalhart had two hits of staggering proportions, and it was recorded in 1924.  And there's no question that Peer set up shop in Bristol to find the next hugely successful act.  \n\nBut on the other hand, Dalhart's two hits aren't necessarily classified as this type of (all-encompassing \"hillbilly\") music.  \"The Wreck of the Old '97\" involved an acoustic guitar, and \"The Prisoner's Song\" only added a mournful viola to the acoustic guitar.  Eck Robertson would add a fiddle.  But to hear a banjo would require either being somewhere live or maybe catching a radio broadcast with Uncle Dave Macon.  And none of this was really an option outside of the American South.\n\nBristol changed that.  Bristol was where the Carter Family first made their presence known, where Jimmie Rodgers introduced his distinctive yodeling, and where an audience well outside the South would get to hear the banjo, the mandolin, and unpolished vocals that took a backseat to brilliantly talented instrumentals.  Perhaps no one summed up Bristol more than the Carter family.  A.P. Carter was just 36, and brought along his wife Sara (29) and his brother's wife Maybelle (a precocious 18).  Peer had already secured a tentative commitment to bring the family to Bristol, but was shocked to see them.  A.P. was dressed in ragged overalls, Maybelle and Sara in clothes that had been made at home.  But once he heard Sara's voice and Maybelle's unique guitar playing, which was less strumming or picking and more scratching, he was sold.  So, too, was America; the Carters would sell over a quarter of a million records within three years.  That's to say nothing of the ensuing Carter progeny, or the millions of people who would grow up and draw inspiration from what began at Bristol.  (Who knew that Anna Kendrick would score a huge hit in 2012 with a remake of a Carter Family song that was [first recorded 81 years prior](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xtxjd9_the-carter-family-when-i-m-gone-remastered-country-music-experience_music)?)\n\nOkay, where the hell was I?  Oh right, needless pedantry.\n\n\"Them linoleum floors\", on the other hand, is a case of nostalgia superseding reality.  Linoleum was patented by a guy named Frederick Walton in 1860, and his company was known as Linoleum Manufacturing Company in 1864.  And when the American Linoleum Manufacturing Company opened up a few years later, the company town was called Linoleumville.  Yes, linoleum floors are associated with household kitchens on both ends of WWII, but they'd been around *long* before then.\n\n\"Petroleum jelly\" is obviously exactly what it sounds like.  Robert Chesebrough was the one who took an unrefined black goop off of oil rigs to refine and discover what it could be used for.  This was in the 1860s; Chesebrough patented the process of refining and producing petroleum jelly in 1872.  And since his first factory was in Brooklyn, this wasn't exactly a product that was unknown to the masses by the time the 20th century dawned.\n\n\"Two World Wars\" is obviously in the 20th century, but \"revolving doors\" are not.  Theophilus Van Kannel was granted a patent in 1888 for inventing revolving doors, and he would receive Franklin Institute of Philadelphia's John Scott Legacy Medal in 1889 for his contribution.  Obviously both of these dates are in the 19th century.\n\nSo all of those folks singing Auld Lang Syne in 1899 were already *very* familiar with linoleum floors, petroleum jelly, and revolving doors; chances are that they had also listened to music created in a recording session.  They needed only to look around or to their own recent past, not ahead into the 20th century.\n\nThat's three cases of bad history in just six lines, three and a half if you include the \"recording sessions\".  And unfortunately, this means that the singer of these lines must be outed for putting his voice to bad history.  And that means that Johnny Cash must join the ranks of Willie Nelson and Waylon Jennings.\n\n**tl;dr - Will Kris Kristofferson emerge as the only truthful member of The Highwaymen?**",

But, if you’re a moderator for a history subreddit that prides itself on historiography and the historical method - then, in the name of history, you’re fair game.\n\nTHE BAD HISTORY SOURCE:\n\nAskHistorians Podcast Ep.1: [On Julius Caesar](http://hwcdn.libsyn.com/p/7/0/3/703a44e3307a981a/AHP_001_On_Julius_Caesar.mp3?c_id=6766145&amp;expiration=1443610560&amp;hwt=7716cb529f8575fee87060456a6bbb97)\n\nThis podcast delves into the life of Julius Caesar as told by reddit user Celebreth. It’s pretty clear from his opening salvo that he’ll be relying on the funky Hollywood stylisation of Caesar; as popularised by novelist Adrian Goldsworthy, who coincidently is Celebreth’s favourite historian. \n\nActually, that's pretty harsh on Goldsworthy - his stuff is pretty good, as far as fan-fiction goes. ;) I jest, I jest…. But seriously.\n\nMy main source will be Suetonius' *The Twelve Caesars*, which you can view online [here](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#46) for free! Ah the internet. I will also cross-reference with Plutarch’s *Parralel Lives* and Cicero’s letters.\n\n**The First Sin** \n\nRight off the bat, Celebreth opens up with a bombshell. Julius Caesar grew up in a \"ghetto\".\n\n&gt; He might have lived in a slightly nicer house in the ghetto, but even in a relatively nice ghetto house - it's still in the ghetto. So, Caesar grew up in the ghetto.\n\nThis is a HUGE historical foul. First thing’s first, we actually have very little information on the early life of Julius Caesar. Both Plutarch’s and Suetonius’ accounts begin around the time his dad died, or when he was 16. By that time, he was the man of the house.\n\nAccording to Suetonius, Caesar took a modest home Subura (a pretty shit suburb), mainly because Sulla took all his money. But that doesn’t mean Caesar grew up poor or disadvantaged. Before he moved back to Rome, he chilled with King Nicomedes of Bithyia (more on that little “parlay” later) AND his aunt was Gaius Marius wife - so it wasn’t like he was some sort of shitcan pleb. \n\nSulla took all Caesar's money because he had that Marius' dick stank all over him. That's it. Doesn't mean he grew up poor. Doesn't mean he was throwing dice in the Jewish quarter til Nona rang the dinner bell.\n\nBut celebreth commits to positioning Caesar as this “hard-working blue-collar every man who, against all odds, becomes the hero Rome deserves” in this quote:\n\n&gt; What’s really interesting is how he moved from those conditions - his relatively lowly status in Rome - to possibly the greatest person that Rome has ever seen.\n\nOk, so:\n\n* Caesar was engaged to a very wealthy equite girl called Cosussita. Maybe it was for money, but I doubt Cosussita’s dad would let her go to family living in squalor.\n* Sulla stripped Caesar of his wife’s dowry and his inheritance. So, I’m guessing he had something worth stripping in ~85BC. Like money.\n* Caesar’s dad was a Praetor. Praetor’s govern things. Praetors make serious bank.\n* The Julii take their name from the son of the Trojan Prince Aeneas. They are about as blue-blood Patrician as they come. \n\nFraming Caesar’s life as some sort of Tupac-esque, rags-to-riches, underdog story is not only historically inaccurate, it’s historically irresponsible. Caesar was a patrician, it’s safe to assume he was afforded a patrician lifestyle. \n\n**The Second Sin** \n\nWe’re barely two minutes in and Celebreth makes the tragic misstep of claiming all of Caesar’s achievements were due, in large part, to the blessing of the Gods.\n\n&gt; If you look at his life, he was, if you believe in the Roman Gods, he was definitely blessed by them because whatever needed to get done the stars aligned in his favour… that applies to his battles, to his politics, that applies to his early life, just him as a person. He was lucky.\n\nFirstly, pretty harsh on Caesar’s accomplishments. Secondly, no. \n\nNow look, I have some pretty contrarian views on Caesar as a general, particularly in Gaul (I think  his 2IC, Titus Labienus, did the heavy lifting over there), but he was most certainly not lucky on the battlefield. His ineptitude was, at times, both calculated and spontaneous, but never lucky.\n\nHe was, however, a master politician. Some of the moves he made used to baffle me with their chess-like precision. It was hardly luck that saw him help Pompey and Crassus into the consulship after the Luca Conference. Plutrach writes:\n\n&gt; When, however, Pompey and Crassus openly announced their candidature, the rest took fright and withdrew from the contest; but Cato encouraged Domitius, who was a kinsman and friend of his, to proceed, urging and inciting him to cling to his hopes, assured that he would do battle for the common freedom.\n\nCato inspired other senators into challenging the political machinations of Caesar, and contesting Crassus and Pompey’s consulship, but Caesar wasn’t a lucky dummy. He knew Cato would challenge him, so he (with Pompey and Crassus’ help no doubt) bribed and bought enough people to secure Pompey and Crassus their positions. Even if that meant cracking some skulls. Plutarch continues:\n\n&gt; Alarmed at [Cato rousing the senators], the partizans of Crassus and Pompey abstained from no disorder or violence, however extreme, and capped the climax by waylaying Domitius, as he was coming down into the forum before day-break with his followers, killing his torch-bearer, and wounding many, among whom was Cato.\n\n**The Third Sin**\n\nBUT CAESAR SLAYED CHIX, MATE. HE SLAYED HEAPS OF CHIX…. mmmyeah, did he but? Like really? Don't all his conquests all feel a bit \"thou doth protesteth too much\"? As Celebreth says:\n\n&gt; If it was on two legs, and if it was a woman, he would sleep with it. We have records of him sleeping with half the wives of the senators who are meant to be the pre-eminent men of Rome.\n\n(EDITTED) Celebreth speaks like a well-drilled, loyal legionnaire about Caesar’s love life. He only smashed SOPPING, WET VAGINAS. He weren’t a BROWN TOWN BUTT CLOWN, m8. Look at all the HEAVY, TURGID VAGINA he smashed, its on the record m8.  As if to defend Caesar’s sexuality, he off-handly says:\n\n&gt;... He fathered a child to Cleopatra.\n\nWell, sure he did. Celeberth goes into great detail about all the train Caesar ran, but never once mentions Suetonius' accusation: \n\n&gt; Being sent by Thermus to Bithynia, to fetch a fleet, he dawdled so long at the court of Nicomedes that he was suspected of improper relations with the king; and he lent colour to this scandal by going back to Bithynia a few days after his return, with the alleged purpose of collecting a debt for a freedman, one of his dependents. \n\nTo be fair, Suetonius dedicates entire chapters to all the weird fucking that all the Caesars got up to. Just a guess, but I think Sueyton-dawg enjoyed a good masto while he wrote.\n\nPlutarch put it a little softer, saying Caesar “tarried” at Nicomedes court and then moves on to more pressing matters. \n\nEither way, Caesar was chasing off rumours about boy buggery with Nicomedes his entire life. Dolabella put him on blast with this line “[Caesar's] the Queen’s rival, the inner partner of the royal couch”. Wow. The mental image alone, Dolabella. K.O. Flawless victory. But, Dolabella was original Pompey’s man before jumping ship to Caesar - so take the insult with a grain of salt because it’s not clear whether he said it before or after he betrayed Pompey.\n\nCicero flat out called Caesar a homo in the senate. To his face. Suetonius says: \n\n&gt; But when Caesar was once addressing the senate in defence of Nysa, daughter of Nicomedes, and was enumerating his obligations to the king, Cicero cried: \"No more of that, pray, for it is well known what he gave you, and what you gave him in turn.\"\n\nInterestingly, Celebreth points to the songs soldier’s sing at triumphs as testament to Caesar’s cocksmanship, and I quote:\n\n&gt; Paraphrasing that song, essentially what they said was: “Oh, hey, you husbands of Rome. You might want to lock your wives up. We’ve got the bald adulterer over here. He spent all your tax money in Gaul, sleeping with their women, and he came back to Rome to sleep with yours. Congratulations.\n\nCelebreth must’ve missed the next verse, which Suetonius (man, this guy loved a good fuck story) quotes as:\n\n&gt; “All the Gauls did Caesar vanquish, Nicomedes vanquished him;             \nLo! now Caesar rides in triumph, victor over all the Gauls,             \nNicomedes does not triumph, who subdued the conqueror.\"         \n\nCaesar was flamboyant, lived lavishly, spoke with a high voice (I can’t find the source on this right now, might just be misremembering it) and dressed opulently. He fit the profile, but fitting the profile doesn’t mean you’re gay\n\nHowever, a historian’s job is to take in all the evidence and make judgements based off that evidence. Celebreth is guilty of omission here; Caesar, whether you like it or not, viciously fought off rumours of homosexuality until his dying day. Not mentioning something Caesar tried to chase away with multiple sexual partners is a historiographer red card. There's a time and place for everything, Caesar, and it's called Bithyia.\n\nI'm gassed.\n\nLove you, Celebreth. It’s not personal, it’s just history. :)\n\nEDIT: I used offensive slurs that paragraph. I'm sorry and truly remorseful for my actions.",
