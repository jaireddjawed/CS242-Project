        "text": "So allow me to preface this by saying the question below is by no means a first, second, or even 10th resort. Just something that got me thinking. \n\nRecently made some chicken stock and without thinking, overfilled my glass mason jar and stuck it in the freezer once cooled. When it froze it expanded and cracked the jar. \n\nI put it in a pot to thaw, and in the morning was left with a broken jar, thawed stock, and a bit of ice leftover. \n\nThe ice looked mostly clear so it got me thinking, would partially freezing, pouring off the unfrozen stock, and repeating result in a more concentrated stock? Some brewers will do this process to remove water content and raise abv. This batch was somewhat weak so it got me thinking whether this would be an option for salvaging the rest. \n\nAgain - this is by no means meant to be some revolutionary technique. Quite the opposite actually in trying to make up for my poor initial effort. Love to hear some thoughts!",

I know it won't look pink, but that's totally fine. Then I saw on the Corned Beef article: \"You can certainly corn beef without the nitrites, but it won't taste the same, last as long, or look the same.\"\n\nWhat exactly is \"last as long\"? Is it safe to corn the beef without the saltpeter / sodium nitrite and dry brine it in the fridge for 1 week with just a ton of salt and spices? Or, if it's not, would adding the saltpeter after 2 days (started it on Thursday) mean that it's too late to be safe to eat? \n\nDon't want to throw out this big hunk of brisket but also don't want to poison anyone when having our delayed St. Patty's dinner.

My second was to add some mild Italian sausage seasonings to the cubed up pork before grinding it and top the burgers with peppers/onions/olives/etc.\n\nI'm also curious about the texture of ground pork (probably shoulder) patties.  Beef patties tend to be looser and are more likely to fall apart on the grill.  But chicken thighs, after two passes through the wide dye of my kitchenaid grinder, get sticky like sausage.",

Luckily for me, my oven appears to be consistent at 170F, however, the steak is taking its sweet ass time warming up. (I’m probably not helping by checking it every 7-10 minutes haha!) Without a doubt in my mind, leaving the steak in this relatively hotter environment for a prolong time will promote a noticeable gradient. In a sense, it’s very much like cooking an egg via sous vide. You can either blast it with a high temperature for a short duration or cook it at a low temperature for VERY long relatively speaking. If my steak is trying to hit 115F internally and the oven is set to 170F, don’t I risk the chance of overcooking the exterior just like an egg?",

Any ways to improve that for making ultra simple shredded chicken? (when the flavor and focal point of the dish will be coming elsewhere)",

Please excuse the incorrect terminology.  On my first attempt, I think I made two mistakes: (1) I used active dry yeast instead of instant yeast (although the initial rise seemed okay) (2) my kitchen was very cold (around 58 degrees) when I removed the dough from the refrigerator.\n\n\nOn my second attempt, I used instant yeast. To try to get a warmer environment, I turned the oven on well in advance and let the dough rise on the adjacent countertop that had warmed slightly. With the oven on, the kitchen/countertop were about 70 degrees.\n\n\nIn both cases, everything seemed fine except that the dough didn't rise at all when I removed it from the refrigerator. It was basically a totally flat loaf shape. I'm really not sure what could've caused the issue. I saw some comments on the original recipe that suggested a similar problem, but never saw a solution. Does anyone have any suggestions?",

        "text": "I really love falafel. Like really, really love it. I've been to Israel a few times, and it's very hard to enjoy a falafel after that; they're just that much better there. There was a small place in my hometown that was incredible, but they closed a few years ago, leaving me destitute and forcing me to settle for inferior falafel.  \n\nWell, I saw Kenji's recipe, and even though I have never attempted to make falafel before, I figured I'd give it a shot. Long story somewhat short, they were very easy to make, and absolutely incredible. Definitely the closest to real Middle-Eastern falafel that I've ever had. It had all the right flavors, none too bold (you often get too much of a cumin taste that can be off-putting to some), the consistency was straight out of my falafel wet dreams... it was perfect.  \n\nMy mom, who is Israeli, was going crazy over them, which is really the highest form of flattery you could ask for.  \n\nOnly regret was not making the zhug, because I love a spicy kick in my falafel, and zhug is what I usually put in. But I don't have a mortar and pestle, and I didn't want to half-ass it.  \n\nHere are a [couple](http://i.imgur.com/WrD2hxt.jpg) of [pictures](http://i.imgur.com/DDwJu55h.jpg) (sorry for shit quality, didn't intend to share them), and [here](http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2016/03/the-food-lab-vegan-experience-best-homemade-falafel-recipe.html) is a link to the recipe.  \n\nThe recipe made 20 balls total, which was perfect.  \n\nTwo side notes: 1) I messed up by not reading carefully enough and leaving my chickpeas in the fridge overnight rather than at room temperature. I was worried this would somehow ruin it, but it didn't appear to have any negative affect. 2) When I took the mixture out of the food processor, I was worried that it was more sticky than the recipe described, as it held together very easily. But after the prescribed 15 minutes in the fridge, the consistency was exactly what the recipe said it would be - barely able to hold together, but enough to hold  the round shape. As promised, none of them fell apart in the frying process.  \n\nThanks Kenji, I will definitely be making this recipe again!",

So I want to buy a hand blender... with the following \"wants\" and \"restrictions\":\n1) it should come with a cup of right diameter (as that seems to be important when emulsifying eggs/oil)\n2) it needs to come with a chopping bowl. Because this way I don't have to get a food processor/coffee grinder... (I don't want to get a food processor because my main big problem is lack of countertop space.... so a hand blender that comes with the bowl attachment in which I can blend marinade spices easily is a really good thing)",

        "text": "Since Kenji has praised the Breville Fast Slow Pro I thought I'd ask here. I'm thinking of upgrading my small $20 Rival rice-cooker because its smallish size is limited to 2 cups dry rice. How does the rice function of electric pressure cookers compare to dedicated rice cookers? My cheap Rival cooks perfect rice every single time. This is something I don't want to compromise on, so I'd rather just do without the multi-cooker and get a larger dedicated rice cooker if the texture of the rice isn't the same. Can anyone that's used both comment on the differences?",

        "text": "I'm gearing up to try the best chili ever again, but I had some problems when I made it last time i'm trying to avoid this go around and thought I'd run my questions by you guys.\n\nLast time I made it the flavor was amazing, but the chili itself was pretty runny. Is that how it's supposed to be? I'm think if I cook it for longer in the oven with the lid off that would fix it, but I thought I would ask if that would be a good idea or not. I also used a 5 quart dutch oven last time that I think was too small that I replaced with a Le Cruset 7-1/4 quart one if that makes a difference.\n\nI'm pretty sure the main problem though, was that I prepared the short ribs wrong/didn't trim them right and didn't cut them small enough; they came out very tough. I ended up using almost 1 inch pieces, and looking at the recipe now, I'm going to make sure they're all 1/8th to 1/2 inch pieces. Also is there a good video guide to trimming the short ribs? I'm not sure if I got the silverskin off but I trimmed alot of the fat off of them, which I think was too much because I didn't have nearly any rendered fat after they were finished browning.\n\nIs there a good place to buy dried chiles online? its pretty hard to find them around here, I had to drive to about 4-5 different places pretty far away to get all of them last time.\n\nThanks for any help guys, love Serious Eats and The Food Lab, just still learning alot when It comes to more complicated stuff.",
