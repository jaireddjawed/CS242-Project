        "text": "Many games, especially expansive exploration-based single player games, feature some type of \"gate\" that blocks the player from accessing certain content until they have fulfilled some certain criteria. For example, in Metroid, you can't open purple doors until you get the wave beam. Or in Dark Souls, you can't get to Sen's Fortress until you ring the two bells. Or in Outer Wilds, you can't access the Ash Twin project until you've learned how to get there.\n\nIt's this third, Outer Wilds style of \"gate\" that I'd like to focus on today - the \"epiphany-based\" gate, aka the \"puzzle\" gate. It's a type of content gate where the only obstacle between you and opening the gate is you learning how to open it. There are no in-game criteria that block you from opening the gate, instead the \"fulfillment of criteria to unlock the gate\" happens outside of the game - in your own mind.\n\nThere are quite a few great examples of this type of gate. Obviously, **Outer Wilds** is the chief of this type of gate - you could theoretically beat the whole game on your first run if you got extremely extremely lucky. But there are others. In **Subnautica** for instance, the islands are initially shrouded but once you discover them it's a major unblocker and a \"whoa\" moment. Or in **Tunic**, a game I am playing now, there are certain abilities you have from the very start of the game that you are unlikely to intuitively discover, and only collecting in-game help pages lets you know about them. An additional example is **The Witness** in which learning how to solve the puzzles, generally via in-game \"tutorial puzzle lines\", is the main content blocker.\n\nI really love this type of content gate. When done correctly, it makes you feel like a genius and always results in a major \"mind blown\" moment. I've oftentimes gotten goosebumps from major epiphanies on how to progress, especially in Outer Wilds. \n\nHowever, there is a MAJOR downside to this type of content gate. And that is that you tend not to forget the details of such major epiphanies. Once you learn how to open these gates, the knowledge tends to persist between playthroughs, and that absolutely ruins the replayability of the game. Subsequent playthroughs are a pathetic shadow of the enjoyment of the original playthrough. I've even waited years between playthroughs, and still the revelations ended up coming back to me.\n\nSo the only solution if you love this type of thing is to continually plow through games that do this well. (Part of the reason I'm making this post is because I'd love to hear your favorite games that do this well.)\n\nSo truegaming, what do you think of this type of content gate? How does it compare to the other types of content gates? What are the best examples of it in action?",

I have no problems dying to a boss, i usually play most of my games on highest or second highest difficulty and die a lot there, its fine.  \nBut in e.g. Doom Ethernal, if you die, you respawn right in front of the boss and can just try again, but soulslikes put me back to the checkpoint and let me walk the same way, every single time, for no real reason, and also respawn all enemies on the way to waste my time.  \nIn that 3-5 mins backtracking every time, i could do 2-3 more boss trys, but no they want me to spend this time walking.  \n\n\nSecond awfull mechanic only bothered me in Fallen Order, in HK it was fine.  \nThe \"If you regen health, you respawn ALL the enemies\" is also a massive time waste, fighting the same group of enemies over and over again if you want to replenish your health.  \n\n\nAnd if some people like those mechanics, thats fine, but dont enforce them on people, just make it toggleable, and those who want to suffer, can suffer, and the rest can choose to dont.",

        "text": "Until the release of the Playstation and Saturn, cartridges were the primary form of media for home consoles. I've hear a lot of reasons given for why the switch to disks was made, like cost and storage space. I was wondering though why these weren't factors in previous generations. After all, the idea of disk based gaming wasn't new, what with the Famicom disk system  and the Sega CD. Yet the Famicom disk system was put to the side despite it having having 4.4 million in sales, which is not an insignificant number. Maybe the feeling was that forcing consumers to purchase a Famicom plus a disk system would make the console prohibitively expensive, yet there wasn't an attempt to incorporate disks into the Super Famicom, where they could have tried to put disks in place of cartridges, making it seem they viewed disks as inferior. The Genesis had the Sega CD but games released for it represent about 10% of the Genesis library, although that's probably more about poor sales than anything else. Even so, the Genesis was originally a cartridge based system, even if the integration of CD technology was tried towards the end of its life. It seems that everyone in the industry accepted that consoles were the superior format until the mid 90's when both Sega and Sony released disk based system. I am trying to figure out what changed. Did new tech suddenly make disks more appealing than cartridges or were disks always better and it just took time for the industry to get there? I have not been able to find an answer to this question and thought maybe someone here would have an answer",

        "text": "Recently replaying Darkest Dungeon had me thinking that adventuring would in fact suck if not for the enormous suspension of disbelief. Any many other RPGs seem to confirm in some quests, but I obviously don't want to spoil anything. Although even in early game the Mass Effect Trilogy, The Witcher, Dragon Age, Pillars of Eternity and more provide examples of adventurers that are sh*t out of luck. Or rather: an average one, not the super rare exception that are the PCs and their companions.\n\nAdventuring would be like real-world combat but much, much worse having in mind all the nasty spells, traps, and whatnot. Human being cannot take a lot of that, so 99% of adventurers would either die, or be traumatized for life and incapable of having a normal life.\n\nChronic stress, fatigue, magic and the supernatural, all the twisted creatures they have to fight and then sentient being, be it humans or anything else, they kill. Or seeing their comrades in arms dying, usually violently. Getting an area-of-effect spell like a fireball or something… how is that different from artillery fire? If it doesn’t kill you or horribly wound you, it is likely to cause a shell shock either way.\n\nI imagine the vast majority would die early because of inexperience, while the rest probably ran out of luck or met vastly superior enemy. Only a tiny fraction of exceptions live to become well-known epic adventurers. Maybe it does take a psychopath to be a successful, well-adjusted adventurer. I’m just having a difficult time picturing a sane human being willingly doing what adventurers do in RPGs on a daily basis.  \n\nThat’s the long story cut short.

        "author": "ConceptualizedPotato",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/11lrv8o/narrative_difficulty/",
        "text": "# Intro\n\nEveryone has their own tastes and preferences. Some people like their games to be challenging, some  prefer more relaxed and peaceful gameplay. Developers try to make their games appealing to a wide audience, so most games have some sort of difficulty options, ranging from \"easy/medium/hard\" selection to \"difficulty sliders\" which allow players to fine tune their game, or optional in-game crutches like teaming up with other people in what was originally a single player game. \n\nBut besides gameplay difficulty there are also other aspects of a game that could make a game more appealing to the players. Take Language for example. People whose native language isn't English might be more inclined to pick up a game that is translated and dubbed in their language. Because of that the developers spend enormous amounts of money on translations and voice acting. It works the opposite way as well, there are incredible games that just aren't popular because they don't have English voice acting. \n\nBesides language there are other things, like Art Style, but these can't be changed as easily as gameplay difficulty or language and are almost always \"hardcoded\" into the game's overall design. \n\nAnd then there's storytelling. It's not unusual to see criticism of storytelling in FromSoftware games - that it's deliberately obtuse, fragmented and incomprehensible. You can often see some people saying things like \"I wish the story was easier to follow\". On other hand you have games like Skyrim or God of War where every bit of the story is spelled out loud, and some players feel like the games are too dumbed down. Many games try to work around player preferences by making things simple and adding optional exposition in form of notes or logs, which provide a bit more context and nuance, but I haven't seen a game which would have \"adjustable narrative difficulty\". \n\nWe already know this in literature as **Abridged** and **Unabridged** versions, where Abridged version of a book sticks to the main story and theme, cutting out the fluff. It can be also observed on Movie or video game adaptations of books. \n\n---\n\n# An example\n\nI'm going to propose an example. I almost feel like I should put up trigger warning because someone is going to be upset about it, but here goes - Imagine if **Disco Elysium** had **adjustable narrative difficulty**. I chose this game because it's just damn good and has very \"heavy\" narrative - it's easier to reduce/subtract than to add and expand. \n\n**Dialogue structure**\n\nIn this case the highest \"narrative difficulty\" would be the game's current state. Let's take some less important side NPC like Annette.  [Her dialogue tree looks like this](https://i.imgur.com/Yg9QJrm.png). Talking with her makes you realize that she's being abused by her mother, and you can help her by talking to the mother. It's not a direct dialogue, you find this out by playing a guessing game with her.\n\nOn lower difficulty Annette's dialogue tree would [look like this](https://i.imgur.com/zkOJ4Re.png). Her dialogue would just introduce her, and she'd ask the player to talk to her mother about letting her into the house because she's cold. A simple quest.\n\n**Exposition complexity**\n\nDialogue in Disco Elysium is loaded with nuance, references, historical and political commentary. The player is often given choices that are only slightly different but lead to different outcomes.\n\nCharacters like Measurehead wouldn't be described as \"Semanese Supremacist\" or \"2.20 m racist behemoth blocking the gates\", instead it would be something like \"large, loud and stupid bully\".\n\nThe Expression of Guillaume le Million would be just described as a \"weird grin\", and most of the realizations, flashbacks and intuitions would be either omitted or integrated into the dialogue in linear, easily digestible fashion.\n\n**RPG elements**\n\nRPG attributes in Disco Elysium are at a first glance complex and not that obvious. Understanding what is \"Inland Empire\" or \"Conceptualization\" requires effort and thought on the player's end. \n\nInstead, on lower difficulty these stats could be just reduced to your usual \"INT/WIS/STR/DEX\" stats\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow obviously this would subtract a lot from the game, and the writers would have to work hard to preserve some resemblance of cohesion of the story and setting that is being presented. Some quests would have to be cut out. On other hand it would most likely attract people who don't like the idea of spending 40 minutes by talking to an unimportant side NPC because they have so much to tell you and because you need to think good 10 minutes about what was actually said to you. \n\n---\n\nThis example is an extreme, I wouldn't like to see this, or any other game 'defaced' this way. Instead, I'm curious whether a game could be built around the concept of \"narrative difficult\" from scratch. An attempt to appease to wide variety of players from \"I want Silmarillion levels of story\" to  \"I have work and 4 children, so I can play just for 30 minutes a day \" and \"I get bored if I talk to a NPC for more than 10 seconds\". \n\nSo, I'd like to discuss these questions:\n\n* Would it make sense to create a game with various \"narrative difficulty\" levels? \n* Would it be possible to manage player's expectations and experiences? \n* Why do you think we haven't seen serious attempts on this so far?",

        "text": "Many games feature \"gates\" that block the player from entering until some condition is met. For example, in the Metroid series, you won't be able to enter Missile doors until you get the Missile launcher. Or in Dark Souls, you can't get to Sen's Fortress until ringing the two bells. I'm sure you're all familiar with what I'm talking about - the tantalizing glimpse at content that can't be accessed yet. I've realized that there are different types of these \"gates\" used in gaming, and I can't decide which is the best one.\n\nFor starters, there is **ability-based gating**. This is when you are blocked from progressing down a route until a certain ability is acquired. Most people are familiar with this through games like Metroid, Hollow Knight, or Zelda. Think not being able to open a purple door in Metroid due to not having the wave beam. This is really enjoyable for me, as the constant hints at further content make me excited to keep playing, and the gates serve to make the game level feel larger and more realistic. I'm not sure there are any cons to this approach. *Example games: Metroid series, Zelda series, Hollow Knight, Jedi: Fallen Order, Prey, Subnautica, etc*\n\nAnother type of gating is **epiphany-based gating**. This is when some piece of knowledge has to be acquired by the player before they can understand how to unlock the gate. The key difference between this and ability-based gating is that for epiphany-based gating, technically the player is not blocked from opening the gate by some mandatory item - it's just that they do not yet understand how to open it. For example, in Outer Wilds once you learn how to get into the Ash Twin project, there's nothing blocking you from doing it immediately on a brand new save file - because you have the knowledge. This type of gating is awesome - it feels amazing when the puzzle finally \"clicks\", it can even give me goosebumps. However, the downside is that this really only works once. You tend not to forget such major epiphanies, and this drastically reduces the game's replayability. *Example games: Outer Wilds, Tunic, The Witness*\n\nA third type of gating is **action-based gating**. This is when you must do some action in the game world to unlock the gate - think ringing the two bells in Dark Souls to open the gate, or getting access to the Institute in Fallout 4. You could almost consider this to be quest-based gating - it's just that the reward for completing these quests is entire levels. I love a great quest reward, but for me it's more fun when you actually get an ability that lets you unlock the gate... *Example games: Souls series, Bethesda RPGs, System Shock 2, older Final Fantasy games, etc*\n\nYou could almost summarize these as \"ability gating,\" \"quest gating,\" and \"puzzle gating\". Of course, there are also linear games with no gates at all, multiplayer games, strategy games, etc. This really mostly applies to big, single player games with expansive, explorable levels, which happens to be my favorite type of game. Games with gates tend to be among my favorite, so I'm always on the lookout for more.\n\nWhich type of gating is best in your opinion? What are some of your favorite games that feature gates?",

Wo Long seems to lack the sense of adventure the souls games have. I can't quite put my finger on it but Wo Long' s levels feel like a chore to just get to the next checkpoint instead of playing through a cool world. \n\nOne thing Wo Long feels to get wrong is pacing. The levels are short and there are checkpoints everywhere. Like american football (the sport I mean) the gameplay of Wo Long constantly halts and it gets annoying. Souls games have also a lot of linear-ish levels too but the pace of playing from checkpoint to checkpoint feels more fun. Wo Long makes me not want to take its difficulty seriously. I can just spend all my heals now and play poorly because dying does not make one loose much progress and the next checkpoint is so close already. \n\nThe loot also bothers me. Instead of varied and cool weapons, you get a choice of a few very basic weapon types with the variety being in the buffs they give. This bores me and makes getting loot feel like a chore. \n\nI dunno, Wo Long just feels like [wish.com](https://wish.com) Sekiro. Will still play through it just to scratch that sweet Soulslike itch and hope the game gets better later on. Good thing this was on Game Pass and I did no have to spend top dollar for this. \n\nAlso WHY THE FUCK CAN'T THE GAME JUST AUTOMATICALLY REFILL MY ARROW WHEN I VISIT A CHECKPOINT??????\n\nAgree?

        "text": "So like many others, I picked up TLoU Part 1 after watching the show.\n\nI've had remastered for a while that I've probably started over like 3 or 4 times, always quitting at around the end of the Boston point. So early on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe problem is, I'm just not into these kinds of games. I despise stealth. I despise shooting controls on consoles (mainly a PC player). I'm a giant baby when it comes to horror.\n\nBut alas, the show got me hooked on the story. So I decided to commit to beating the game (mostly because my girlfriend wanted to watch). I'm not adverse to difficult games. Beat Bloodborne, beat Elden Ring. I don't mind a challenge. But for the sake of getting through the story, I decided to play this on the easiest settings.\n\nFirst of all, the sheer amount of difficulty customizations you can do is amazing. Just want to make stealth easier while combat is still a challenge? You can do it! Just want to make your melee weapon never break? Go for it!\n\nBut even playing everything on the easiest setting as I did, one of the most amazing things was how tense the game still was. I still found myself being extra cautious. I wanted to avoid combat as much as possible, or at least take out people quitely. My heart rate was still raised, even though there wasn't much at stake. My palms still sweat. I was still scared. But most importantly, I was actually having fun playing a genre I typically hate!\n\nThere are many games where easy mode kind of takes away all the fun. That was not the case in TLoU, so this is yet another praise the developers should get on top of everything else.\n\nNow on to Part 2 (on easy)!",

        "text": "Let me start off by saying I love this game. It’s full of so many little things that add to the experience and immersion, things that didn’t necessarily need to be there but they went the extra mile. For the most part, it perfectly translates Metroid into 3D. It’s just easier for some people to talk about negatives than positives, plus this game is highly regarded already. \n\nI wish enemies didn’t just completely stop following you when you leave the room. Of course I could see how it would be annoying if you absolutely had to kill every space pirate or Chozo ghost you see, so I’m not sure what the solution is, but it breaks my immersion when I leave a room and they…. give up, just like that.\n\nI wish the grapple beam were better utilized. Thankfully other games in the series would take note. Here, it’s pretty much exclusively used to swing across gaps. Neat, but underwhelming.\n\nMagmoor just a hallway so it can be a slog to get though. Needed more elevators to other areas too. \n\nMapping out which elevators lead to which parts of different areas can be confusing. A simple color coordinating (like in Phazon Mines) could have helped here.\n\nThe Chozo Artifacts. Obviously this is the most infamous part of the game. I remembered that I’d scan hints and need to collect them all and do a lot of backtracking. I don’t really mind the idea of that since it’s the perfect excuse to explore and pick up lots of items I missed initially. What I didn’t remember, and what really makes this part bad to me, is that the game will arbitrarily withhold hints for the last two artifacts until you have the others, or at least some of the others. I do not understand this decision. Now instead of going to the impact crater and then all over the world and then return to the impact crater, I have to do all that, but then just run back to two more areas I’d already been through on my artifact hunt and then finally make my way back AGAIN to fight Ridley. It’s extremely tiring.\n\nAnd Metroid Prime itself is a little underwhelming as a boss, even if it looks cool. First phase is fine enough but it’s mostly just “match the colors”. The second phase, it has only two attacks. It hits the ground creating a wave you have to jump over, or it…. roars and gives you a little boop.",

        "text": "Have you ever played a mainstream game to be confronted with the tutorial message: Use WASD to move. Use the mouse to look. Did you roll your eyes? I do. I sigh, and try to speed through the bare bones stuff. However, for some players this will be their first ever video game, that prompt to use WASD to move might be the first step on their journey with the hobby.\n\nSome games assume a certain amount of competency from the player, with tutorials only for specific mechanics, not the basics like using WASD to move. So what happens when a game that assumes fundamental game knowledge is played by a player who doesn't have it?\n\nRecently, I got to watch my partner try their hand at **Tunic**, a top-down souls-like zelda-like puzzle/exploration game that drew them in with its cute art style and resemblance to Zelda games, which they played when they were young.\n\nFor those that don't know, Tunic can be hard. The art style and similarity to kids' series might have you thinking it'll be a breeze, but the boss fights and some encounters are up there with Elden Ring levels of difficulty, taking skill, cheese, or time to beat. I spent more time fighting its final boss than I did any bosses in Elden Ring (possibly with the exception of Melania).\n\nOne of the things they struggled with the most was mastering use of the dodge roll to avoid attacks and take advantages of openings in enemy patterns to do damage. Taking time to watch, I realized why: they didn't understand how it worked fundamentally. They were almost exclusively dodging away from enemies, or spamming it when faced with dangerous attacks, or not using it when I thought it'd be a no brainer to dodge.\n\nI wanted to take the time to lay out what a dodge roll accomplishes, partly to put to words something that so many of us might simply understand intuitively, and partly to provide a bit of advice to readers who otherwise don't dabble in games with souls-like combat.\n\n**The purpose of a dodge roll is not to get out of the way of an attack. It is to be invincible during an attack.**\n\nI-frames (invincibility frames) is something many games with dodges confer, from Dark Souls to Super Smash Brothers. During the I-frames of a dodge, you're immune to being attacked, whether or not it appears to hit your character onscreen. This is typically not something mentioned in a tutorial, or in any notes within a game's menus. Unfamiliar players may think the burst of speed from dodging is supposed to avoid attacks, when in reality it's a tool best used for positioning. The act of dodging makes you invulnerable for a short time, and the movement is for getting to where you need to be to do damage to your foe, not to get further away from them.\n\nUnfortunately, I watched my partner face down a tough boss (the librarian, for any curious) and set the game down to \"try it later\" which I understand is code for \"I'm never touching this game again, back to Stardew Valley with me\".\n\nWhat are some other things that we understand intuitively about new games we pick up, that games might assume you know? What things might a player new to the hobby not know without every being explicitly told?",

        "author": "Gamobser",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/11kch95/gameplay_bricks_classification_of_video_games/",
        "text": "Game classification is something I thought about a lot and while I understand that the current way of labeling game genres works well, I still dislike it, because of the influence from marketing and historical baggage, that gave us inconsistency and poor definitions.\n\nBefore I continue, I have to specify that I am concerned only by classification based on gameplay. We can classify games based on other things too, like setting. Game genres as we know them today sometimes mix gameplay and setting/story together. I personally don't like that, but I can't say it is wrong.\n\n# Few examples\n\n* **Simulation** \\- I think today this is usually understood as a game striving for realism (visual, physics etc.). That would be fine, except we are running into the problem of old games being labeled as simulation despite being pretty far from reality (due to hardware limitations of the time), making them just as realistic as a non-simulation game of today. Also, what about realistic portrait of a fictional world with magic? Is that a simulation?\n* **Sports** \\- I saw them described as games in which players control either players or managers of a real or fictional sports. So it only depends on the narrative telling you that this is a sport game. That makes me thing Sports are just a setting and not a type of a video game.\n* **Adventure** \\- From what I understand, the distinction between Puzzle and Adventure game boils down to whether the game has a narrative.\n* **Educational** \\- When you think about it, all games are teaching you something – to play the game better. And sometimes these skills are applicable outside the game. So, educational game is no different from other games, just instead of shooting monsters you have to solve equations to proceed.\n* **RPG** \\- Do we have a definition for this? I have seen people saying that RPG is about role playing, but in the context of video games that does not work well, because one can play a role in a pure shooter, as long as there are other characters you can talk to. The only distinction that makes sense to me is whether the game has a progression system.\n\nSo, are there better definitions or even a completely different classification system? Well, I found one.\n\n# Gameplay Bricks classification\n\nThis system distinguishes games based on \"rules that define gameplay core\" of a game. For this purpose they define 10 \"gameplay bricks\". The idea is that any game can be classified by a combination of these bricks.The bricks are:\n\n1. **Avoid** \\- \"This brick asks the player to avoid elements/traps/opponents. For example, in the racing game *Need for Speed* the player must avoid to hit walls and obstacles with his car.\"\n2. **Match** \\- \"This brick asks the player to match or to keep one or several elements in a particular state. For example, in *Pong* the player must put the ball out the area from his opponent's side. Another example, in *Chess*, the player must put the opponent's king in a particular state where it can no longer move.\"\n3. **Destroy** \\- \"This brick ask the player to destroy elements or opponents. For example, in *Space Invaders* the player have to destroy every alien in order to win. This brick also deals with the idea of collecting or catching elements: for example, the dots eaten by *Pacman* can be considered as \"destroyed\", so can the checkpoints in a racing game.\"\n4. **Create** \\- \"This brick allows the player to express his creativity through the act of assembling, building or creating elements. For example, *Crayon Physics* let the player draw any object to solve puzzles. This brick also deals with audio-related creation. However, this brick does not refer to pure \"model-matching\" games such as puzzles, which are already represented by the brick Match.\"\n5. **Manage** \\- \"This brick let the player manage various resources in order to perform actions. For example, you need to manage your ammo and weapons in *Call of Duty*, to manage gold and wood in *Warcraft 3* or a wide range of resources in *Sim City*.\"\n6. **Move** \\- \"This brick let the player drive/pilot/displace an element or a character. For example, *Action Driving Game* let you move a car.\"\n7. **Random** \\- \"This brick let luck attributes values to the player. For example, *Jackpot* games let chance decide of players scores.\"\n8. **Select** \\- \"This brick let the player select an in-game element by any input device (mouse, keyboard, gamepad…). Adventure games such as *Bud Tucker in Double Trouble* let the  player select many elements such as inventory objects or dialog answers  by mouse. This brick also indicates that you can select different  weapons in a *FPS*, different buildings in a *RTS*…\"\n9. **Shoot** \\- \"This brick let the player throw or shoot elements. For example in any shoot'em up like *Tyrian 2000* you can fire a large range of weapons. In *Mario Kart*, you can shoot green and red shells at opponents. However, games that let you \"hit\" elements without actually shooting objects refer to the Select brick.\"\n10. **Write** \\- \"This brick let the player inputs an alphanumerical value. For example, text-based adventure games like *The Coveted Mirror* let you type the action to perform, while interactive storytelling games like *Façade* let you freely dialog with virtual characters.\"\n\nThe authors also distinguish games based on other criteria, but the gameplay is covered by these bricks.\n\n# Thoughts and criticism\n\nI find this idea very interesting, because it works a bit like a model that could be used to make predictions. Some of the brick combinations do not describe any existing game, but that does not mean it is not possible to make such a game.\n\nHowever, these bricks are so abstract that I don't think you can make a practically usable classification with them. You will find that there are many games which are very different, yet they are described by the exact same bricks. And newer games use most, if not all, of them.\n\nI’m also not sure the Random brick makes sense. Imagine a very simple game of chance, you press a button and you either win or lose. In one case this is random, in the other you win on every third push of the button. In both cases I think the gameplay is the same – you push a button.\n\nAlso, some of these bricks can be a bit hazy in their distinction. For example, what is the difference between shooting a homing projectile and creating a suicidal bomber unit?\n\nThat is why I decided to go with more traditional labeling, just trying to keep it consistent and well defined. Nevertheless, I think this system deserves more attention.\n\n# References\n\nwww.serious.gameclassification.com/EN/about/bricks.html#GAMEPLAY",

        "text": "Hello everyone,\n\nI am doing a research on esports and gamers behaviour and would love your input.\n\nHere's the survey [https://tally.so/r/mYPGEq](https://tally.so/r/mYPGEq)\n\nAs per the template, please find below info on the research\n\n \nResearch extract \n\n&gt;Esports is a rapidly growing industry that has gained considerable traction in recent years. With millions of fans worldwide, the esports community has become a major player in the world of gaming and entertainment. However, despite its rapid rise in popularity, many people still wonder how esports compares to traditional sports and whether esports viewing is a solitary or communal activity.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;To answer these questions, this research aims to investigate the esports community's viewing habits and preferences regarding specific titles. The study explores whether esports viewing is a communal or individual activity and how it compares to traditional sports viewing. The researcher also seeks to understand the factors that influence esports fans' interest in watching competitive gaming.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Esports tournaments are increasingly being broadcasted online, with large audiences tuning in to watch their favorite players and teams compete. Many esports fans not only play games themselves but also watch others play. Thus, the study aims to investigate whether esports viewing is a social activity, with fans watching games with friends or family, or whether it is more of an individual experience.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Esports fans are known for their loyalty to specific titles, with some games having a much larger esports following than others. By exploring which titles have more of an esports following versus a casual gaming audience, this research will provide valuable insights into the types of games that are best suited for competitive gaming.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;To gather data, the study invites participants to complete an online survey that will ask questions about their viewing habits, their favorite games, and their opinions on esports as a whole. The survey will be distributed across various esports communities to ensure a diverse range of responses.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Ultimately, the goal of this research is to shed light on the growing esports industry and help stakeholders better understand the factors that influence esports fans' interest in watching competitive gaming. By providing insights into esports viewing habits and preferences, this study will help inform the development of future esports events and tournaments, as well as help guide the marketing strategies of gaming companies.\n\nMy contact:  [zanini.francesco@studbocconi.it](mailto:zanini.francesco@studbocconi.it)\n\n* contact data of the survey author outside of reddit \n* Bocconi University\n* the research institute, university or college responsible for the work\n* Survey asks for your discord or reddit account for follow ups, but is not mandatory.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/11jylw9/my_short_analysis_on_why_jrpgs_gameplay_feels/",
        "text": " Warning: wall of text\n\nSince I was a kid, I have always been fascinated by turn-based JRPGS series like Final Fantasy, Shin Megami Tensei, and Trails series because of their world-building, the story, the characters… But I couldn’t push myself to play any of them for over one week because I felt their gameplay was so tedious and boring. I thought this was an age problem, so I leave them alone and go play other games. \n\nSo recently, I had the urge to play a bunch of older jrpgs titles, including Ys Seven (PSP), Shadow Hearts (PS2), Bravely Default (3DS), and Star Ocean: Second Evolution (PSP). As you can see, they all have different presentation and playstyles, the only thing alike is that two are turn-based, and the other two are action games. And after finishing Ys Seven and BD, I think I finally understood why the turn-based JRPGS category is considered boring and unappealing.\n\nShort answer: the problem is not their core gameplay, but the traversing, grinding, and dungeon crawling parts.\n\nLong answer: \n\nFirst I would like to analyze **the grinding part** in the gameplay of turn-based JRPGS compared to action JRPGS:\n\n* In action games, the players get fun and satisfaction from quickly and precisely pushing buttons and waving the joysticks. They had to utilize their hand movements, their quick thinking, their reflex, and their knowledge of the enemies… in real-time, which in turn created a very dynamic gameplay loop, where every encounter with an enemy will play out differently depending on the smallest differences in movement. Remember how you can fight through a wave of enemies in Dark Souls/Yakuza without losing a single HP, and the next time you meet them, you missed one swing/punch and then they just literally obliterated you? In action games, even grinding feels exciting and satisfying.\n* In turn-based games, the players get the fun and satisfaction from using their knowledge of both their party and the enemies to mix, match, and min-maxing their party damage through skills, buffs, debuffs, and many more. This result in a battle system that can be described as “every battle is a puzzle that can be solved in multiple ways”, where the players need to use the right tools in the right way to win a battle. This is very addictive and interesting when you first step into a game and have to figure everything out while learning the mechanics and the monsters. BUT the problem is, it gets old real fast. After you’ve fought a monster type in a dungeon several times, you pretty much understood all their weakness and made a viable strategy to beat them, which mean you “solved the puzzle”. Every following battle with this enemy is just mindlessly repeating the solution, which is super mind-numbing. After a while, grinding and progressing literally becomes uninteresting mindless chores.\n\nYou see, because of how turn-based games are designed, if there are no innovating features, they mostly handicapped themselves with **a boring gameplay loop.** Interestingly, the “tactics” sub-genre is not really affected by this just because the characters are capable of moving around, which creates a battlefield where there is barely any same battle even with the same enemies =&gt;  different puzzles with different solutions almost every time, require the players to actually think.\n\nSecond, I would like to talk about the **pacing of the turn-based JRPGS.** And no, I’m not talking about the story, since there are already many great action games with an overcomplex story accompanied by lengthy dialogue and still a success. I’m talking about the pacing of the battles.\n\nIn traditional JRPGS, many games use random encounters, which is, by every means, inconvenient and time-consuming. This system forces you to fight even when you don’t want, and before you say “But you can just escape!”, not every game gives you a 100% escape. Even if there is, you have to spend several seconds watching the battle introduction, and wait for the escape animation to finish to actually escape. Random encounter just constantly breaks the flow of the game, while literally bringing nothing good to the table. Later, there are many games that allow you to see the enemies right on the dungeon map, and you can either avoid them or hit them to get an advantage (like Persona 3 and later titles in the series) which is a very welcoming change.\n\nIn addition to the mindless grinding, slow attack animations are also a culprit. Seeing your characters use magic for the first and second time might seem cool, but if that skill has a 10-second animation and you have to use it in every battle, it might not be cool anymore. This is my problem with Shadow Hearts, where even normal attacks may take no less than 7 seconds to finish. It gets worse if you consider every battle needs about 3-5 turns to win. This problem is, however, solved nicely in Bravely Default, where you have options to speed up the game to 2x or 4x speed, and finish “already solved puzzle” battles in one turn using the Brave system. That’s the main reason why I managed to finish Bravely Default.\n\nIn conclusion, if there is a turn-based JRPG that doesn't have all these handicaps, I think it would do well than most JRPGS on the market right now.",

        "text": "The depiction of Hogwarts never was so realistic as in Hogwarts Legacy. The overworld and the whole castle looks awesome and believable and is a wonderful combination of depictions in the book and the movies. It's really great to finally have a video game that brings this world to life like that. But with the evolution of graphics and the demand to make everything look and feel realistic, problems arise that are not as problematic in simpler and more illustrative video games.  \n\nIt seems so incredibly strange to me that a game in which you play a 15 year old student has greater adventures and more brutal adventures than most adults while single handenly masterting the everyday school life. You're supposed to be a child but even in the intro you see someone chewed on by a dragon and noone is fased by it at all. Then a attack on Hogsmeade by trolls which came straight outta Warcraft 3 and you just fight to win even though all the people around you run for their life. It's get even worse when there is a cutscene which reveals that the troll attack was all about you and you're supposed to be kidnapped by some evil people. What's the next step? Drinking a butter beer I guess?  \n\nEven away from the main plot, there are similar problems all the time. Such incredibly strong dissonances everywhere that I don't know why people ignore them so hard, whether it's the developers or basically the gamers. For example, you're supposed to be a good person, but the next moment you're killing animals and people in cold blood. You smash them around, set them on fire, freeze them to death and even later you have the ability to use theunforgivable curses. And a lot of rewards are locked away and random homes of others people in which you break in and rob them. I don't understand why they make it this way. It would make more sense if you're a professor instead of a child but even then the things you do seem wayy to vast. Bigger than any adventure seen in any previous book or movie.\n\nWhy does the game try to so hard to be the next Skyrim or something? Why doesn't it concentrate more on the lessons, puzzles, everyday life (dialoge with other students and professors), stealth, defensive options, exploration on the school ground and basically a lot of stuff that is already in but is sidecontent instead? It doesn't really work the way it is and that's a real bummer. If it would be very different if it was a SNES game from 1994 but that's not the case. I still enjoy my overall experience because a lot of good things are in place but I really really need to be blindfolded sometimes. The game is so stupid in so many ways.\n\nHas anyone also had similar experiences and can't get past this dissonance?",

        "text": "Replayability in single-player games exists, but it can be difficult to apply them in multiplayer and mobile games. For them, there is a similar concept in game development — retention\n\nThe \"retention\" mechanics are designed to bring back players who left the project earlier and keep their attention. Such methods are so in demand that it is easy to find individual vacancies for specialists in this field.\n\n\"retention\" is like the consequences of a \"promise\" to the player that \"tomorrow will be better\", and it will make sense to return to the game. There are two sides to this \"promise\".\n\n**The first one is creative**. For different games, this \"promise\" needs to be made in different ways.\n\n**The second is mechanical**. You can just sort out the mechanics from other projects to figure out what will suit your game.\n\n**Ways to retain players.**\n\n* \\-A constant increase in the amount of content can give the player both a task within the current session and a long-term goal. In addition, it can be sold, as do large MMORPGs like World of Warcraft and Destiny 2, in which you have to pay for add-ons. The main drawback of this \"method\" is its obvious complexity — it takes time and money for new content.\n* \\-\"Investment\" in the game world is the purchase of a house, the construction of buildings and their decoration, which, as it were, \"bind\" the player. It can be very expensive to create them, and therefore the player will not want to lose the fruit of his labors. Such \"investments\" work, for example, in survival simulators like Minecraft and Rust. But this technique also requires time and money, and in the same survival genre games, \"vibes\" are often arranged — resets, after which everything acquired disappears.\n* \\-Social interactions are typical for single-player games, which are usually discussed at the release or in another period of popularity, and for MMO with their guilds and co-op. Community members immediately plunge into joint activity and \"get attached\" to the game, but at the same time society generates problems like quarrels and toxicity. Besides, according to Koster, guilds often \"migrate\" from one game to another.\n* \\-The gaming economy can attract gamblers who like to increase their wealth. By the way, we have already talked about the economy in games — sometimes it is very similar to the real world, from which it inherits most of the problems. It is very difficult to create a logical, dynamic economic system, as, for example, in EVE Online.",

Golden age of JP games.\n* early 00s USA, lots of laid off devs from dot-com bust, increased supply due to good amount of CS grads from uni, golden age of US-made PC games\n* Poland, late 00s-2020, extremely cheap labor relative to US/other EU, Witcher series (CDPR) and Fortnite BR. (PeopleCanFly)\n* South Korea, early 00s, lots of cheap PC devs, golden age of Korean MMOs (Nexon, RO)\n\nWe can clearly see games (especially AAA titles) struggle when labor gets too expensive. Japan hit a big rut in the 00s with cost overruns in big JRPG titles, CDPR lost their cheap labor advantage when Cyberpunk was under development, Blizzard is a shadow of its former self. (I am not endorsing crunch culture)\n\nHow will code completion software like Github copilot and even ChatGPT to do game development if it makes things simpler even despite high dev costs?

If someone raves about Final Fantasy VII and Super Mario 64, it's probably not like they'll care for King's Quest VI or Half-Life.\n\nBut why is this? I assume one reason for these retro games, at least, is because of nostalgia and accessibility. People don't seem likely to go back to platforms they didn't have as a child, while they WILL play \"new to them\" games on platforms they grew up with -- this is purely anecdotal based on watching retro Twitch streamers, btw.\n\nHowever (and keeping up with pure anecdote here, not like I have any hard data), it seems like this carries over to modern day gaming. I've basically never seen anyone who's a fan of The Witcher 3 who is also a fan of Persona 5. And I'm sure they do exist, so I'm not looking to be proven wrong in that sense, but there certainly seems to be a bias against PC gaming for those who prefer console gaming, going so far as to hear one person say \"There just aren't that many interesting games on PC\" even though that's dismissing a platform that spans DECADES.",

        "text": "I don't intend to bash anyone's preferred way of playing a game and I hope you instead consider this a rhetorical write-up.\n\nFor the love of god, if you're interested in playing the Zero Escape series, which has some of the most incredible writing to be found in games, play the first in the series - 9 Hours 9 Persons 9 Doors - on a DS or 3DS if you can. Don't assume that just because it came out on PC and mobile that those are acceptable ways of playing.\n\nTo explain exactly why would require some heavy story spoilers. What you should know is that it's about experiencing games as an art form distinct from any other art form, with its own uniquely powerful form of expression. \n\nIf you've played through Nier Automata, you might know the struggle of trying to explain to someone why the game needs to be played online. Explaining why 999 needs to be played on a DS or 3DS is exactly the same as explaining why Nier Automata needs to be played online. \n\nIf you need more convincing, I'll quote the writer Uchikoshi himself answering interview questions, saying that the game simply wouldn't work on any other hardware (yes, it came out on Steam after he said this). So this is straight from the horse's mouth:\n\n&gt;This game was designed specifically for the DS because of its unique interface. The DS has a top screen and a bottom screen, and I thought to myself, \"What can I do that utilizes this unique setup?\" The result I came up with was 999's \"twist\". So, no, it wouldn't have worked on any other platform.\n\nAnd here he is saying that the **entire story** is written around that very moment in the game (the one that necessitates a DS or 3DS):\n\n&gt;For me, I first start by creating a rough draft of the characters' personalities. Then I make a sort of rough draft of the setting. Next, I figure out the \"twist\" for the story, and work toward that by coming up with a plot that fits that particular twist perfectly. So the \"twist\" comes first, basically. Of course, the characters and the setting that I come up with early on almost always end up drastically changed. I write a rough draft, then draw a line, then erase my rough draft, then draw a new line... It's just that process over and over. I don't know when it's \"done\" until I finish writing the whole script. I always write my stories thinking \"I wonder what's going to happen to these guys afterwards?\" Overall, I don't change the \"twist\", but I will change the story A LOT to get to it. \n\nHopefully my point is clear. But one caveat I can make is that if you truly don't care about experiencing this for yourself, and you'd rather just get through the story comfortably and learn about what you missed out on after finishing, then you can play it on Steam and then [watch this incredible video that clearly outlines the version differences, and what gets lost in translation](https://youtu.be/DkzebxbXx4M) (spoilers in that video obviously). Admittedly the PC version is a much smoother experience with the inclusion of a timeline chart that lets you teleport between different points in the story (although, restarting from the beginning each time is significant to the plot, so it's a question of comfort vs immersive story experience) among other QOL improvements.\n\nI've seen arguments about which version should be preferred. What I really don't like hearing is that the PC version should be preferred because the only advantage the DS has is just one moment near the end. Please don't think it's \"just one moment\". It connects to everything that happens before that moment and recontextualizes the whole experience profoundly.\n\n*What if I play the DS version on an emulator?*\n\nNah, it still wouldn't work on a computer monitor. But if you can find a way to emulate the game on a tablet, that can work. I'd accept a tablet running a DS emulator. \n\n*Do the other games in the series also need to be played on the original hardware?*\n\nNope, PC is fine for Zero Escape 2 and 3. The first in the series is the only one that this is an issue for.",

        "text": "Characters in games have been dying since the seventies: whether it's ducks in Duck Hunt, submarines in SeaWolf or a spaceship in Asteroids. But death as a mechanic did not appear immediately, and even later they began to experiment with it.\n\nToday, death is used to punish mistakes, teach the rules of the game and make it part of the narrative. And how it was before, how death became a tool of game designers and how it is used in games — tell me, I'm interested.\n\nWhen the gaming industry was born, developers made money by limiting the playing time on arcade machines, and gave endless lives. Died — try again, the time is over — pay a coin.\n\nThe mechanics of death as the end of the game became popular only when the arcade game Space Invaders (1978) was released. In it, the player was asked to destroy all the alien enemies coming from above, who periodically fired back and accelerated when they lost their own. The game ended when the lives ran out or the opponents reached the bottom of the screen. If the player destroyed all the aliens, he was given an extra life and a new wave of stronger enemies.\n\nAt first, death was no longer the end of the game. Consoles and computers were then bought once, there was no Internet and developers could not get paid for each new attempt — therefore, it was not permissible to end the session due to player errors. Death has become conditional: as long as the console is not turned off, you can continue the passage, even if the lives are over.\n\nOne of the first games with no end of session after death was Super Mario Bros. (1985). The player was given a limited time to complete the level and three lives, which can be replenished by collecting coins or finding secret items. After being wounded, Mario lost one life, and the game continued. If a player lost all their lives or did not have time to complete a level in the allotted time, the game started from the beginning or from the middle of the level.\n\nWhen the saves appeared, the mechanics of death were revised again. Saves were introduced by the developers of the text adventure Zork I (1981). The game could be played for weeks, and so that the progress would not be erased after restarting the device, they came up with saving it.\n\nAfter Zork I, other developers introduced saves, games became possible to download at any time, and players stopped worrying about death.",

        "text": "I know this is probably a very controversial opinion, but I feel like 76  is one of the worst AAA live service games that exists today. \n\nI bought the game on sale after it released when people were dumping all over it, and for the first 2 years, really enjoyed playing it. It wasn't perfect by any means, but it had its own unique charm, and I believed that they would do the same thing they do with many other games: improve it over time. But it's been a very long while, and the game doesn't feel any more fun to play.\n\nMy issues with the game are as follows:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*  **Its too empty**\n   * I explored the entire map in the first year or two playing the game, and I wasn't no-lifing it, or playing 12 hours a day or anything. Just casually running around doing all the quests, following breadcrumb notes found in computers or on desks. But most of the game is just so vast, and incredibly empty. You find a new area or place, and think \"Hey! There must be something unique or special here, right?\" Nope. Just some generic enemies like scorched, and maybe 3 interesting items in the entire mile wide area\n* **The story is very underwhelming**\n   * You spend the majority of the game starting out following this well-written story by someone that faded from the world long ago, and expect the same quality of storytelling as any other Fallout game (3, NV, 4....), but it's just... so underwhelming. The ending doesn't take your breath away, or make you feel anything. It just feels like you followed a single very long and very tedious quest, and now you've checked it off your list. It lacks dimension, and soul. You'd think for something you spent so much time doing, you'd feel something, but it doesn't resonate with you\n* **There's virtually no modding support or encouragement**\n   * This is the big one for me. Every single Fallout game in the past has been substantially fun *on its own*, this game being the sole exception, and maybe Fallout 4 if your standards are really high. But not only does this game not feel fun. The devs don't support or encourage the one thing that made every single Bethesda game in the past a hit: the mods. This game would've been saved just like every other one before it if mods were officially supported, and you could play offline with player-created content. But instead, they put on a blindfold and throw darts at a wall full of bland and terrible ideas, and come up with new \"game modes\" that are just silly, not really fun at all. For example, the one where you can jump super high like you're on the moon, or the most recent one is a no-fast travel high risk PvP game mode. Oh, and let's not forget nuclear winter, their failed BR game mode they abandoned, and vault-raids, which people really enjoyed but required effort to maintain so they just gave up and removed it entirely. It's sad how the *one thing* that has enhanced *every single Fallout game* was not allowed here\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd describe Fallout 76 as a Fallout-style game that is so unbelievably strange and poorly developed that it's almost hard to believe that this is an actual honest to God Fallout game. I appreciate that it has an active community of die-hard fans. But I don't feel that it makes up for the fact that they had a chance to make something incredible, and revolutionary, and simply chose not to do that. \n\n So what do you think? We probably have a lot of Fallout fans here who still do really enjoy and like this game.",

        "text": "Hello, so I am a single-player first guy. All my games are played single-player primarily, solo-queued with voice chat turned off in competitive games, only really enjoyed solo content in pve. However, I feel my (and many others') way of playing has completely wrecked the MMO's original true meaning. And currently, absolutely no successful games have really kept the MMO/virtual world/metaverse term coined in the 1990s.\n\nBack in the days of Ultima, Star Wars Galaxies, EverQuest etc. etc. etc., content was primarily player-driven. Soloable content was almost non-existent, story and NPCs were merely enemies and maybe vendors. Honestly, it was pretty much a parallel world to IRL.\n\nLet's put it this way, everything known in our world was passed on by humans of flesh and blood, discoveries weren't done by themselves or some higher being (like developers of the world or something idk), History of planet earth wasn't predetermined. In Ultima, obviously there was background predetermined lore, tech probably wasn't there yet.\n\nAnother thing about real life, being a powerful person, war and history doesn't happen without other people. This is why MMOs like SWG were hardly soloable, history couldn't happen alone.\n\nThe closest example of an \"old MMO\" I can think of is Elden Ring, I have to say Miyazaki's world is pretty much like an MMO of old. Above I said that mandatory multiplay is what a true MMO was, in Elden Ring you aren't going to get very far if you don't communicate with outside players when you are stuck. It's built around knowledge and discovery. \"oh this build kills malenia easily\", \"hey, i found a secret entrance to the city!\". taking notes is essential and all that. its quite a brilliant take, despite the cost to accessibility.\n\nSpeaking of accessibility, I always was one of those people asking for \"easy mode\" all the time, coming to think of it, all these games need is allowing people of all abilities to be of equal, not better cause the enemies are weaker. \n\nIn the MMO, I'm noticing voice chat is becoming the only way to communicate, which i find outright ludicrous, especially being hearing-impaired myself. It disallows us HOH to make those connections required for us to take on a true virtual world. quite sickening in fact.\n\nThe true meaning of MMO, when it was first coined was a parallel to our world, a social place where all knowledge and story is of the humans playing here in this universe. That can't be done with soloable content being forefront. It can't be done with a predetermined storyline you are mandated to go through calling you the \"chosen one\" all the time when really, you are not.\n\nI find it sad that there just isn't anything like SWG or Ultima. Pax Dei was announced recently which was exactly the original vision, but so was New World which had to change direction.\n\nThings may change but overall, the feeling of an MMO and a \"virtual world parallel to ours\" has devolved into single player story-driven games with other players sprinkled in some places.\n\nHow do you feel about MMOs as a parallel to our world, how can we get back there? Do you believe the success of FromSoft, talk of the metaverse and announcement of Pax Dei will shake things up? i'm certainly hoping so.",

        "text": "While working, now and then I have some let's play or other running off to the side. Recently, YouTube's algorithm decided to recommend me a blindfolded 120-star Super Mario 64 speedrun. That's right - there's a dude called Bubzia who spent years figuring out the right techniques to be able to collect every single star in Mario 64 without any visual cues. The run took 11-12 hours and contained everything from perfect gameplay timed to the level music to accidental deaths that on occasion wasted nearly an hour. The closer the run came to completion, the more insane went the chat. Even though I was watching a recording and knew he'd end up succeeding, the atmosphere was totally infectious and I found myself rooting for the guy. The whole thing gave me a week or two of great entertainment. If you want to watch it yourself, [here's a link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC_ClvO-FZE).\n\nShortly after, I stumbled across this [True 100% Deathless](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niuCpSOX_jI) run of Celeste, by Rickfernello. I'm currently in the middle of watching that, and it's giving me the same sort of satisfaction. Anyone who's played Celeste knows it's tough as nails, and beating an entire level without dying once, never mind the entire game, never mind every single thing there is to do in the game (which incidentally means that you have to beat each level twice - without making a single mistake) is a mind-boggling prospect. And this guy's the first and only person to do it.\n\nThese runs prompted me to post this thread. While I'm aware that I'm veering dangerously close to list post territory, I thought this topic might be interesting and novel enough. Do you know of any other fantastic gaming feats that are completely uncontested and probably will remain so for a very long time? What do you think of people who spend so much of their free time working towards a goal that at the start seems so unobtainable, only to reach it after years of persistence? Is that a quality you strive towards yourselves or do you consider it energy badly spent? The dopamine rush when your goal is achieved must be out of this world, but what happens afterwards? Will it always have to be replaced by an even loftier one because it's all about the grind?\n\nLooking forward to your thoughts and suggestions!",

A level so bad...\"who thought this was okay?\"\n\nFor instance:\n\nPlanescape: Torment has one of the most agonizing levels I've ever had the misfortune of playing. Avoiding spoilers, this level tasks the player with activating four levers scattered throughout the area. Okay, all good...except the area is absolutely rife with massive, hard-hitting enemies with tons of health. Even one can be extremely hard to kill, and they constantly block your path and swarm annihilate you as you desperately try to get through narrow hallways to the switches. What's worse is, if you activate a switch (which leads to a cutscene each time), it doesn't pause the game during the cutscene. You can be killed *during the cutscene*. That means, you can't just get lucky running past them - you have to kite them away from the switch, which is extremely frustrating as there isn't much room to do so without getting swarmed.  Oh yeah, and there are also traps that damage and paralyze you. Last time I played it, when I'd finally succeeded, my game glitched and the portal didn't open, which meant I had to go back a bunch of saves and trial-and-error it all over again. \n\nBut one positive part of the experience was that I realized I find this pretty interesting. I'd really like to hear other people's examples of this since I'm struggling to remember more on my own.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/11gmnj1/capcoms_resident_evil_5_dilemma/",
        "text": "So with the release of the Resident Evil 4 remake being right around the corner, the inevitable question becomes:\n\n*\"Will Capcom remake Resident Evil 5?\"*\n\nThere's a few key issues that make the answer to this question less than straightforward.\n\n**#1: Resident Evil 5 is controversial**\n\nTo get the low-hanging fruit out of the way, Resident Evil 5's concept drew controversy upon its release. In RE5 you play as Chris, an American white man, gunning down hordes of mostly black Africans infected with mind-controlling parasites. Some of those Africans even wear stereotypical tribal garb in later levels. There's no evidence I've seen that Capcom had ill intent with this concept. It could simply be that since RE4's \"fish out of water\" premise in Spain was so successful, they decided to do it over again with Chris in Africa. The broader historical/cultural context of western imperialism probably did not occur to them. RE5's Africa is wildly inaccurate, but so is RE4's Spain. Nevertheless, it's easy to see why it would be controversial at a glance. Capcom even added Sheva to the game in response to the controversy.\n\nIt's fair to say that the gaming industry has become a lot more culturally sensitive in recent years. Some gamers decry this, but I think it's been mostly a positive. Some recent examples in Resident Evil include Jill wearing less revealing/more practical clothing in the Resident Evil 3 remake, and the Spanish villagers speaking native Spanish in the Resident Evil 4 remake (instead of Latin American Spanish like in the original).\n\nThe question is, is it possible to \"fix\" Resident Evil 5's premise to be more culturally sensitive? Can you make a horror game set in Africa starring a white American man without drawing controversy? Or is the game conceptually flawed?\n\n**#2: Modern Resident Evil is in many ways a rejection of RE5**\n\nThere's no question that Resident Evil 7 went out of its way to distance itself from previous entries (namely RE4, RE5, and RE6).\n\n* RE7 has a much darker and more realistic aesthetic (via the RE Engine) - much of RE5 takes place in direct sunlight\n* RE7 has more naturalistic dialogue, with characters speaking more casually and often swearing\n* RE7 brought back classic survival horror elements such as interconnected map design, limited resources, etc - a far cry from RE5's linear action co-op spectacle\n* RE7 has seamless room transitions, as opposed to the cutaways and loading screens of prior games\n\nRE7's success paved the way for a new era of Resident Evil games, all of which now use the RE Engine. While each new game has had its own identity, it's fair to say that they follow in RE7's footsteps. Atmospheric survival horror experiences aiming for a realistic aesthetic.\n\nThe question is, is it possible to make RE5 using an engine and design philosophy that was crafted in opposition to it? Since Capcom has seen success by moving away from RE5's style, does it make sense to go back?\n\n**#3: RE5 is not RE4 - the importance of map design**\n\nCapcom appears to have successfully remade RE4 in the RE Engine, with many big action setpieces being almost direct copies, while still adding a whole host of new content, mechanics, and various features. They've managed to retain RE4's identity while also acting as a sequel to the RE2 remake. Shouldn't remaking RE5 be just as simple?\n\nWell, no. Despite what it might seem, RE5 is not just \"RE4 with co-op\". RE5 is by all rights a much messier game than RE4, structurally. The original RE4's chapter structure felt like an afterthought, basically a way to hide loading screens, with the game being divided into three major areas (village, castle, island). Turning it into a seamless interconnected map still took a ton of work, but it was possible.\n\nRE5 is MUCH more dependent on its chapter structure, with most missions having no physical continuity whatsoever. Capcom would basically have to invent a map out of thin air. They would have to put in so much work to make it seamless that it would be an entirely different game. While RE4 acted as a transition from classic RE to action RE, RE5 is very much action RE, with some missions being pure action spectacle (for example the turret sequence). RE5 also has other elements that set it apart from RE4, such as a simpler real-time inventory, and no merchant NPC.\n\nAs is, it would be much more difficult to turn RE5 into an exploration-focused atmospheric horror title.\n\n**#4: Modern Resident Evil is focused on single-player, and puts little effort into multiplayer**\n\nLet's look at Resident Evil: Umbrella Cops, Resident Evil: Resistance, and Resistant Evil: Re:Verse. They were all multiplayer, they were all outsourced, they were all poorly received, and they were all immediately forgotten upon release. Despite RE5 and RE6 selling incredibly well, Capcom has not bothered to put out high-quality multiplayer RE games since. All the effort has gone into single-player titles.\n\nGranted, the same was true when they made RE5. While they had released multiplayer titles like Resident Evil: Outbreak, RE5 was mostly delving into uncharted territory. Yet the game was a huge success. The question is, can Capcom recreate that success? Are people still interested in co-op shooters? Should RE5 be turned into a single-player experience instead?\n\n**#5: RE5 makes no sense to modern audiences**\n\nWho is Albert Wesker, and why does he look and act like Agent Smith from The Matrix? Who is Chris Redfield, and how does he know Jill and Wesker? If all you've played are the RE engine games, you won't have the slightest clue. You'll only know Wesker from the memes.\n\nRE1 is unpalatable to many gamers because of its classic fixed camera style (which I love, mind you). Capcom has forgotten Code Veronica even exists. None of the plot points that RE5 was designed to pay off have been set up in this new RE Engine remake universe.\n\nA significant portion of RE5's story only works in the franchise's broader context. Without it, a lot of it comes off as random nonsense, with zero emotional connections. They would have to significantly rewrite most of the story. Which, to be fair, is probably a good idea anyways, because even in context the game is pretty ridiculous. But then, is there even a point to remaking it? Would it just become \"Resident Evil 5\" in name only, a sequel to the remakes rather than a remake of the original RE5? Is it better to cater to fans of the original or a potentially broader audience that has only played the RE engine games?\n\n\\---\n\nCapcom has had a lot of success with its remakes thus far. From a business stand-point it seems obvious that they will remake Resident Evil 5. But, as I've laid out, RE5 has a lot of issues that make remaking it a major challenge.\n\nWhat do you think? Will Resident Evil 5 be remade? SHOULD it be remade? If so, should it be faithful to the original, or does it need some serious changes?\n\n&gt;!Let's not even talk about RE6, LOL.!&lt;",

I used to absolutely love RPG's such as Zelda, Skyrim and a few others. But now days i only play 1 game and that is it. Its Cities Skylines and i will only play it for like an hour before switching over to YouTube and watching vids there or even just talking to my friends.\n\nMy mates still love gaming and we all have been gaming for a really long time as well, but they still play for hours and hours.\n\nI didn't think much of this back in 2022. When the Pokémon Legends game came out, i reordered it and was so hyped for it. I found out there was a small delay due to flooding over east but that just hyped me up even more. When i finally got the game i played like less than an hour and didn't play again until a few months later when i did a bet with my friends which made me get up to the 3rd boss after that i put away the game, it hasn't been used since. \n\nI thought this was just me getting out of Pokémon games but after that i stopped playing my switch completely coz there was nothing to play on there for me, every game i found boring. \n\nAfter years of saving and waiting for a PS5 i finally bought it. The game came with the new God Of War. I played for like 2 hours and i just found it super boring.\n\nDoes anyone have the same experiences? And is this just a sign ive just lost interest in gaming all together? Is this like a attention span problem that a doctor needs to see?",

        "text": "OK, so I’ve watched the new gameplay video for Final Fantasy 16. I will just say it’s *different.* I have already seen a few groups of people give their first impressions on the game. One group says this game isn’t Final Fantasy; it’s Final Fantasy in-name only. They say the series is dead and won’t be getting the game. Another group says the game looks amazing (with a subset of these people saying this is their first time getting into the series), and the last group doesn’t hate the new gameplay but are skeptical until they show more or can play a demo. \n\nWas Final Fantasy always like this? Did the implentation of the ATB system piss off the players of FF1-3? Did 12’s gambit/‘real time’ system slap the face to every player who played 4-10? \n\nI do remember FF13 was the start of the mainstream controversy surrounding the gameplay/game mechanics of the series. You essentially *could* put no thought into inputting commands. It looks like the Stagger bar DID carry from 13 and FF7R. Final Fantasy 15 introduced a completely different style of gameplay gamers of the series weren’t used to (holding x or whatever button to automatically attack/dodge).  It seems FF16 is completely embracing the ‘action’ combat that 15 introduced.\n\n. I thought I remembered something in Final Fantasy 15.. where some text came on screen that said something to the effect of “This game is for long-term fans and new players of the Final Fantasy games”. With Yoshi saying he wanted to attract the GTA/FPS ‘genre’ of gamers to 16.. in addiiton to those who may not be good or who are intiimidated  at ‘actions games”.. is this game *really* for the long-time fans? Or is it more geared towards a fundamentally different type of gamer? Apologists will say, ‘Final Fantasy has always done something different’. “Final Fantasy isn’t defined by its turn-based combat’. “The makers of each game decide what Final Fantasy is”. \n\nDoes it have more to do that Final Fantasy is straying more away from its ‘Role-Playing game' roots and is taking a dive into the ‘action-adventure’ genre? If it is, is that a fundamentally *bad* thing for the franchise? Can there be too many changes to an IP in which the game is *really* in name-only and doesn’t resemble the type of genre it once was? And if so, should gamers care? \n\nI think there are 4 pillars of a Final Fantasy game. I think the first, and most important pillar is its story. The second most important pillar is its gameplay, since that’s what you’re doing THE MOST of. The next are the characters you play with and interact with in the world (are they relatable, interesting? Why should I care about them?). The fourth pillar is the world itself. It’s going to different towns, different locations with landscapes that make your jaw drop. Understanding the world economy, what makes the population of cities *tick*. ect.\n\nWith that being said, can you change the gameplay enough to where it’s not considered a Final Fantasy game anymore? For arguably the majority of the franchise it’s been by in large, turn-based (with an implentation of an ATB system).  Imagine if the mainlline Halo became a turn-based game or a top-down shooter after a few iterations after being FPS since its original release? Sure, it says HALO ‘#X’ on the box but is it *really* Halo anymore? Is it fair to the developers that gamers have opinions about gatekeeping the ‘essence’ of a franchise?",

        "text": "I’m not considering any nostalgia factor nor any feticism for hardware or cartridge stuff, in other words to be clear I’m not a fanboy, a retrogamer, nor I want to write another apology of the good old times compared to modern shits (and yes I’m a boomer but this is not the point of this post…).\nThat said, do you believe we’re really having new or different gaming experiences playing most of last-gen games, compared to the 32-bit era’s titles? Say the PSX and the N64 times.\nIt’s a honest question, maybe you guys have different views. \nFor me, games evolved a lot in terms of graphics (of course), sound, complexity, details, framerate and lenght. \nBut most of the times I feel I’m not enjoying modern titles much more than what I used to do 25 years ago, because the gameplay in the end it’s quite similar and didn’t really further evolved for most of gaming genres.\nPlease consider I’m specifically referring to the PSX-N64 era. Because if we look back (SNES and Genesis) than I’m the first to say that the gameplay was hugely different for most of the genres (much closer to the 8-bit gen).\nBut in the mid of the ‘90s the introduction of the polygonal graphic and the capability of the machines to handle 3D gaming environments brought a real gaming revolution which I think it’s still the baseground of modern gaming.\nNow I’m not saying that a PSX it’s still as good as a PS5 but if for some kind of sorcery tomorrow we had to go back to the gaming technology of 1998, I think I would still be more or less the same game player of today.\nAm I the only one with this thought?",

Even over 2 years later some of this years big name games are going to be cross gen games. on the xbone/ps4 and xs/ps5.\n\n If on the new hardware the game can target 4k 60fps or even 30 with high settings decent chance the old hardware can handle say 900p(or slightly less) 30fps low settings. So it shouldnt be holding back the current gen. and some games like hogwarts legacy even launch on old gen a few months after as to not take too much dev time from the current gen releases. but still some time and potentially more importantly money is given to old hardware versions that could be used on the new ones.\n\nBut given that a lot of the hardware differences can be taken care of by targeting sub 1080p 30fps instead of 4k 60 that to me makes it look like no where near as big a deal as it could be.",

        "text": "I know you think this may be a ragebait title. What? How am I comparing the god of the gaming world, the undefeatable Rockstar, with a company that routinely gets shit on for being creatively bankrupt like Ubisoft?\n\nHear me out.\n\nI don't mean R* should follow the tower climbing, mtx filled, collect 300 of X throughout the map. Even though GTAV has lots of that 'Collect X'  in the form of letter scraps, spaceship parts, etc.\n\nI mean in terms of core gameplay model. To make this discussion easier let's focus on the recent entries, GTAV and RDR2. Both of these games came under heavy criticism for their linear gameplay design.\n\nUpon replaying R* games I realized just how shallow they really are and how terrible the replayability is. \n\nOnly 50% of GTAV's single player mission campaign (69 missions) has actual \"Gameplay\" where the player can drive and shoot how they wish. The rest of the missions are long extended cutscenes. Drive here and watch this happen, then walk to the marker and press X to watch this happen, then do some shallow minigame just for the LOL factor, end mission. Case in point: Eye in the sky, Reuniting Family, Fame or Shame, Casing the Jewel Store, etc. \n\nThe game presents a 'stealth system' which is nonexistent and can never be used outside of 1 or 2 occurences. The game gives you a variety of tools and sets its missions in large open environments, but still follows exact scripts. You have to approach from here, you have to do this, etc. \n\nThat mission where you kill the Mark Zuckerberg clone? It's literally just drive here, press X, then drive here, press X, then drive here, press X. You could argue that its a tutorial to teach the player about clothing stores and introduce some characters, and its littered with comedic dialogue (like the whole game) but that's not really a \"defense\". Especially if the game relies on these mission types throughout its entire campaign.\n\nThe mission \"Fame or Shame\" is once again just Drive to the arena, watch a ridiculous cutscene, then drive some more, and watch another ridiculous cutscene. Too many missions are just movies with control given to the player in tiny batches so it doesn't feel like a 15 minute cutscene, even though it really is.\n\nWe tolerate it, especially the first time, because the writing and production value is so high. We laugh our way through it. But on a 2nd playthrough, or a 3rd ... what benefit or fun do I get from that mission? NONE. None at all. \n\nAnd TOO MANY mission are like this in the game. HALF OF THEM. **HALF of the missions in GTAV's single player campaign are just interactive cutscenes.**\n\nNow let's compare this to games in Ubisoft's portfolio. Now let's focus on close comparisons like Watch Dogs and Far Cry. Both of these games feature that true sandbox approach. \n\nThey give you a WIDE arsenal of tools in both the LOUD and STEALTH genre. I mean WIDE. For stealth you have bows, throwing knives, melee kills, or you can even get cheetahs to stealthily kill your enemies. For loud you have your usual assault rifles, RPGs, C4, remote explosives, or you could just get a helicopter and do a giant aerial assault. \n\nI imagine a game with RDR2 or GTAV production value, but where missions had the design approach of Far Cry. Where I could chose to attack a fort by descending from a hilltop with a bow and arrow. Or charging the front door with a canon. \n\nGTAV has all sorts of attack helicopters/planes but they never are put to use in the story outside of 1 or 2 scripted sequences. Imagine how different it would be if you, the player, went out of your way to steal a helicopter from the military base and then you could actually choose to use it in a certain mission. It would dramatically change the game. All you get are tiny, minute choices like in RDR2 when you can either knife a guy yourself or direct John to do it. \n\nTL;DR\n\nRockstar's mission design in their open world games is utterly atrocious. It's very linear, deprived of player choice, and the action has no real depth to it. Most of the gameplay is \"take cover and pick off the guys in a shooting gallery\". \n\nUbisoft's mission design is miles better. Almost every mission in a Ubisoft game takes plan in a large environment that can be approach from any angle. Sneak in through the back door, or a skylight on the roof, or through this back window. Stealth it up, or maybe shoot it up. And decisions made by the player throughout the game culminate and can pay dividends in each mission. Did you steal X device earlier? It can be handy here now. Did you unlock X skill earlier? It can be handy now. Your choices matter.",

We have a whole race (goblins) that are treated as second class citizens, they have heavy regulations on what they're allowed to do, they're not allowed to use wands, and seen as untrustworthy nasty creatures, and most wizards seem to have this idea that goblins are just fine being treated this way? Naturally, some goblins decide they want equal rights and start a rebellion, and in comes our protagonist, sent to squash this rebellion and kill hundreds of goblins that dare rise above this oppression? And holy shit do we kill a ton of them haha...\n\nNext, we're given a literal slave to clean our room of requirement, and treat it as a normal part of being a student at Hogwarts... (I guess this has been a criticism with harry potter in general for a long time)\n\nThe next part is the animal poaching, so like we're given a magical bag we can use to go and displace these animals from their natural habitat, so that we can imprison them in our petting zoo to harvest materials from them, so that we can build more powerful weapons? And sell the remaining animals to stores so they can harvest materials from them? It seems we're not protecting them from poachers, we're just killing poachers so that we can eliminate the competition. The game is so weird about it too, the number of times it emphasizes that we're RESCUING these animals is kind of hilarious. Almost like the devs knew how bad it looked so they slapped RESCUE BEAST in as many menus and text dialogues as they could.\n\nAnd then i guess there's the ludonarrative dissonance on how we're expected to break in to homes and steal everything we can get our grubby hands on. But maybe these wizards are so morally bankrupt that this isn't a big deal lmao.\n\nI almost wish we were _allowed_ to canonically be the \"BaD gUyS\", and like actually be allowed to go full evil and kill people, since then at least it would make sense why we're such fucking assholes? Without this it almost seems like the game doesn't realize how morally reprehensible we actually are?\n\nEvery time I play this game [this is all i can think of...](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1e681c0a-1e62-4a4c-b1ba-7144af0e1c5f_1155x647.png)",

        "text": "While I have a lot of negative things to say about Nintendo's approach to gaming, I have to give them credit where credit's due regarding their handling of a game's release this gen. Something I think they're doing well:\n\n1. Generally, revealing games releasing within a year. \n2. Revealing games via a showcase. \n3. Having a consistent stream of 1st party titles with release dates to look forward to. \n\nThe first point seems to be where a lot of the industry is moving towards. Sony in particular appear to be moving in this direction and like Nintendo, keeping a tight lip on projects being revealed long before they're ready to be released. I very much welcome this approach as the practice of revealing a game multiple years before release only to delay the game further out was frustrating. I'm more than happy waiting for a game if it means the developers aren't going to hate their lives while trying to push out what is still often a version that needs improvement, but it still begs that question as to why they chose to reveal it so early on. \n\nI think one of the reason games were being released so early on was because of showcases like E3. This effectively reinforced publishers showing off whatever they had as the event would usually attract a lot of viewers so you'd be guaranteed attention. Nintendo however had a pretty interesting track record at E3 and seem to have a hard time not being awkward during some live events, so changing to video showcases allowed them to control their content and perhaps mask the cringe a bit. COVID-19 further reinforced that publishers already have enough social media backing and once E3 was cancelled, publishers had no choice but to lean in to their social media marketing. With that being said, and with the recent reveal of Elden Ring's DLC and Hi-Fi Rush, some publishers also seem to shadow drop big news which can have mixed reception. Personally, I prefer the showcase and the specticle around it, rather than having the publishers reveal a big game like they're posting what they're having for dinner that night. \n\nLast point is important as I think the long development cycles of current AAA games are proving to make it difficult for publishers to present a steady stream of titles. As it stands, Sony only has the Horizon Forbidden West DLC and Spider Man 2 is unannounced. Nintendo on the other hand will constantly leave you with another title with a release date to look forward to. This chaining keeps consumers within the ecosystem, pushing away buyer's remorse if there's a bit of a draught. I think the fact that they release games all year is also great as a lot of publishers seem to aim for a late year release window and capitalize on holiday sales. \n\nSo yeah, while some publishers do some of those things to handle their game releases, Nintendo seems to be doing it the best. Interested in getting some feedback on either on the general state of game releases, other major publisher's handling of releases or anything else.",

        "author": "WeebSlayer27",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/11ejwki/why_systemic_games_matter/",
        "text": "1- (emergent gameplay examples)- For those who don't know, emergent gameplay is basically really creative gameplay... ok, that's not a good explanation so let me put some examples:\n\nThe korean backdash is emergent gameplay in Tekken, essentially is exploiting the \"looseness\" of the animation canceling mechanic. Once you do a backdash you can cancel before the complete full animation is complete, but you CAN'T do another backdash, so to circumvent this players found out that you can just crouch to cancel the animation and backdash again.\n\nPeople call it a \"tech\" but the fact is that it's an exploit. Regardless if it's beneficial or not, it's by definition an exploit of the mechanics of the game (this originated before the 2000s so no surprise developers overlooked stuff like this all sorts of games).\n\nEmergent gameplay isn't limited to exploiting mechanics, it can be just using the mechanics of the game on a bigger scheme, like luring a nearby predator to a base in Farcry and making it take out some enemies for you... not much on a exploit but rather just a good strategy overall, since animals have all sorts of ways to interact with NPCs and sometimes it's even intended (like when a predator is caged within a base and you shoot the lock to free them, this is clearly a defined path, it's optional the way is clear). \nGlitches aren't necessarily part of emergent gameplay. \n\nWith that said, a valid criticism that emergent gameplay from exploits have is that it's not part of the environment of a game.\n\nThe korean backdash totally changed how the game played out, many moves became safe on whiff and kick attacks of most characters became garbage tier (they fixed those things in subsequent games anyway)\n\nMeaning, the Korean backstep was something that didn't interact with the other elements of the game as the other elements themselves did between them.\nIt's no different than discovering the ancient ballista \"behind the shield\" Marauder cheese. It shows this was clearly not inside the game design because this was nerfed heavily.\n\nSome people argue with basketball: When basketball was invented there was (and is) a rule that you can't run with the ball...\n\nWhat's a good way to go around this limitation? That's right, passing the ball to yourself repeatedly. How? Bounce it on the floor. And that's dribbling for you.\n\n-The catch is that new rules needed to be made so that dribbling became also part of the system of interaction that the rules within basketball had. In other words, adjust it so that it interacts the same way passing does with holding the ball.\n\nThe rules, which stand today:\n\n\"A player who is dribbling may not put any part of his hand under the ball and (1) carry it from one point to another or (2) bring it to a pause and then continue to dribble again. A pass or fumble which touches his backboard, basket ring or is touched by another player. PENALTY: Loss of ball\"\n\n-From the NBA website.\n\nAre there emergent rules to make the Korean backdash adjust? No... i mean, no. Technically buffing other stuff did sort of fix the balance issues, but the lack of limitations on the K backdash are still there even if it doesn't affect the players directly. If a robot did the inputs on a inhuman levels of speed it would shine to light how broken it actually is (it's not like AI hacks and macros already exist but whatever.)\nAnd so, the Korean backdash has a place in the game, yes, but it's limitations aren't clear in comparison to other rest of Tekken's mechanics. \n\nEven combos are emergent gameplay, in Street Fighter 2 people discovered that you could string many moves together, it was broken back then but now we have games that have a whole set of mechanics (rules) that put limits on such system. Like having a stun bar or just a complex stunlock mechanic (GG Strive just to an example). \n\nBunny hopping was balanced in the modern quake games, now you can't go flying 3 miles in the air at will from a flat surface... and the momentum physics in modern quake games is just more arcade-y than Quake 1 so that's that, it's more leniant and pretty much an unnoticeable difference in gunfights. \n\n\n2- (Doom Eternal as an example of a systemic game)- Now let's talk about Doom Eternal :\n\n\nDoom Eternal is the example of a game with great systemic gameplay.\n\nEverything interacts with everything accordingly, in harmony. \n*There's no way around it.*\n\nThe closest thing to emergent gameplay was the ballista splash damage cheese for the Marauder... and it was heavily nerfed. \nBHopping is there... mostly useful in speedruns though, in combat it's just not even conventional, it's straight decorative. \n\nCurrently the most emergent gameplay in Doom Eternal that I can think of is... Marauder rocket cheese? \n\nIt still kind of works, but it's still situational at best with how aggresive Marauders can be. Not even Doom Zero or DraQu use it in their runs. (Actually DraQu does use it... in specific speedrun strats). I think it's because it's not very ammo efficient considering you would need half of your total rocket ammo to deal with a single Marauder. So it's only kinda good if the arena consists of a Marauder and other easy squishy demons. \n\n\nOne could argue that weapon combos are emergent gameplay but... that's more of \"strategic emergence\", if that makes sense, those are more accurately 'microtactics' that help measure enemy health in relation to gun damage. Just like chess has positions that are the best to take.\n\n-Even with all those possible examples of emergent gameplay in Doom Eternal, people who play at high level know that Doom Eternal simply has a systemic game loop. Stuff interacts with each other as it is, without is and buts. No gaps in the rules. No going around rules. \n\nThe most basic elements of this is the notion of the movement, the \"doom dance\" if you will. \nThey notice that you have to keep moving in a certain way in order to have higher chances of success. \nOther elements might be demon weaknesses, meaning the weakness to certain weapons that each demon type has, like the Pain Elemental to the ballista. \n\nThe player uses the mechanics of the game with accordance to the interaction it has with the rest of the elements of the game: Glory kills give you health, and so learning when to do a glory kill is an advantage. \nHaving clever ways to use glory kills (like using it to take a breather) is cool, but not emergent gameplay, because that's how the mechanic of glory kill interacts with the demons regardless of your actions... you gain iframes whether you like it or not. \nOnce you start a glory kill animation, you will gain iframes and you can't circumvent this. \n\nThe point is, Doom Eternal technically has a systemic combat, but it feels like it's emergent because how many paths the mechanics themselves open up... although the restrictive aspect of the high difficulty gives Doom Eternal the edge. Increasing your effectiveness with ONLY the mechanics the game offers you is a universal aspect of difficulty in videogames, restriction itself implies difficulty to most players. And Doom Eternal's gameplay has these foundational blocks that make it's gane design stand out s\n\n-Not having freedom and having to succeed with only the card you were handed (the mechanics and the limitations of them). \n\nLook at Sekiro, that game is nigh-uncheese-able. \nThe game actively tells you to *learn how to deal with enemies with the mechanics you have*, your main mechanics are blocking/deflecting, dodging/dashing, spirit emblems (meaning skills and prosthetic skills) and counters (mikiri counter, jumping counter, lightning reversal). In Sekiro you can't go around these, because you need them (and consequently learn to use them) to succeed.\nBosses will test your mastery of each of these mechanics. Just like UN, Master Levels or Horde Mode test your mastery over the mechanics. In Sekiro/Doom Eternal, you don't discover new mechanics, you simply don't... and it works. \nThe game gives you the hand, and you play it. \nThere's no \"cancel this animation with a jump to~\" NO, you just play your hand. Use the mechanics. You have to solve a puzzle, there might be many ways to solve a puzzle, but the tools you have to solve the puzzle are the same... as well as the sl\nsolutions having the same foundation. \n\nDash, quick swap, chainsaw, glory kill, blood punch, flamethrower, crucible/hammer, etc. \n\n(I talk about Doom Eternal but idk about about any other doom game, I played Doom 1993 but I guess it has to have so crazy emergent gameplay on it. So educate me on that one) \n\n3- (a bunch of examples of the influence of emergent gameplay in videogames)- See, the modern player has an obsession with emergent gameplay, regardless if they know the term. \nSandboxes with \"loose\" mechanics (mechanics with a lot of leniant quality of life characteristics, like lots of frames to cancel an animation) the opposite of \"Ubisoft tailored game\" (which Ubi games actually a lot of emergent gameplay but whatever).\nThey ask for games with a lot of smoothness in them, mechanics that lean more on the player's rules rather than the game's rules. Many good acclaimed games are built around this. Anyone who played Dark Souls 1 and Elden Ring knows this difference, Ds1 animations are almost a death trap if you don't time them well, in Elden Ring it's not that of a big deal. \n\nFunny enough, Deus Ex (great games) still not mainstream despite being VERY abundant with emergent gameplay, probably because the game is kind of systemic if you think of it as \"the mechanics of Deus Ex are there specifically to be emergent gameplay\". Deus Ex MD kinda scratched the surface, still not that crazy, despite how insanely good that game is.\n\nThis is actually one of the reasons metroidvanias stopped being mainstream, being locked out of areas because \"you can't double jump\" and you have to go acquire it somewhere else. \n\nA microscopic example of this in the \"great games\" category is God of War 2018, most animations of attack can be cancelled even in *the first frame* of the animations with a dodge or block. This actually lead to a serious cheese exploit of forward dash punch spamming but fortunately is kinda obscure despite being so easy to do. GOWR fixed most if not all of those op attacks btw. \n\nOf course, some attacks can't be cancelled midway (slow, big, high damage attacks and some specific attacks) but the game still has that element of 'looseness'. \nThe reason for the term 'loose' it's because the action snaps easily from the connection it has to other mechanics, in this case the ability to cancel animations easily leads to the mechanic of attacking being loose to the aspect of risk/reward in the game, it's purpose is not clearly defined, why have heavy attacks when you have light attacks that can be cancelled?\n\n Obviously GOW's combat isn't so shallow, I am purposefully skipping elements like enemy types, hyperarmor, spacing, and other things just to illustrate my point. Even while skipping those elements, some games don't have such saving mechanics to complement their combat and actually suffer from that.\nLike COD MW2019 with the broken slide canceling.\n\n- Doom Eternal is one of the few games where systemic combat is different from the standard of combat despite the obsession with emergent gameplay from the population. People are tired of having to adjust from one game's mechanics to another... so, game developers know this and make mechanics very loose, mechanics that work on a vacuum really well, and with questionable effects on the whole structure of a game element.\n\nModern games don't have that 'restrictive aspect ' many older games have (older games in mean 2016 and before). Even Uncharted 4 is relatively very systemic compared to recent games... a game that was considered to have crazy emergent gameplay on it's era lol. Alien Isolation, *Amnesia*, Outlast, Resident Evil and many more games are now considered systemic, when in the past were the ones with quite the emergent gameplay.\n\nI almost forgot about Shadow of the Colossus, very important in the topic since it's closer to being a systemic game than an emergent gameplay game.\nBut to make the point short, that game has almost no crazy complex mechanics. \n\nI have to mention Ultrakill here, Ultrakill is, to an extent, opposite of Doom Eternal, in Ultrakill you can make stuff work and it works, it's more freedom than restriction. You can abuse the coin but... where's the fun in that? \n\nIf you ask the same question in Doom Eternal it would be \"You can just abuse the super shotgun, but where's the mastery in that?\" \n\n- Ultrakill lets loose, Doom Eternal requires. \n\n\n4 (conclusion and clarification) I'm not saying those mechanics are bad, just setting the differences. Again, those mechanics are fine and I love the combat in GOW and Ultrakill, and whatever game I mentioned. I'm simply, and just simply, pointing out the differences. (God I'm going to get attacked by those points lol).\n\n- Back to Doom Eternal, most systemic games are \"revolver games\", games that revolves around it's rules, it's own mechanics, it's own strong foundations. Which is one of the reasons Doom Eternal has such a great systemic combat and will probably remain niche despite it's initial acclaim on release. It stands out from the games that 'made it' because of that reason. \"With little you do a lot\" or however that saying goes.\n\nSystemic games usually if not always lead to the guidance of mastery of the game as opposed to most games with a lot of emergent gameplay. Doom Eternal wants you to master it's mechanics to fully explore what the game has for you to enjoy, for example. Having too much emergent gameplay would mean that the game isn't about mastering dash, quick swapping or glory kills all in harmony, but rather use these mechanics in a vacuum to essentially go around the puzzles that are the combat arenas. Obviously every game has a scale of mastery in them, but systemic games are *about* it on their foundation.\n\nAnd Doom Eternal isn't the only game that's like this, Sekiro, Ghostrunner and Hollow Knight come to mind, but it's certainly not a thing in the industry anymore. \n\n-Then again, emergent gameplay isn't wrong, it's actually really good and leads to insanely great games like BOTW, that game *is about* emergent gameplay, but we have to acknowledge that we need systemic games too. \n\n(I used Doom Eternal as an example for systemic gameplay, but I'm pretty sure there are other games out there, and since the discussion of Doom Eternal's combat has been known for a while now, I figured it didn't hurt to have a well documented topic as an taxis for my point).",

        "text": "Emergent gameplay and why Doom Eternal is great\n\nFor those who don't know, emergent gameplay is basically really creative gameplay... ok, that's not a good explanation so let me put some examples:\n\n\n(If you already know the context surrounding emergent gameplay, skip to 2)\n\nThe korean backdash in Tekken, essentially is exploiting the \"looseness\" or \"leniancy\" of the animation canceling mechanic. Once you do a backdash you can cancel before the complete full animation is complete, but you CAN'T do another backdash, so to circumvent this players found out that you can just crouch to cancel the animation and backdash again.\n\nPeople call it a \"tech\" but the fact is that it's an exploit. Regardless if it's beneficial or not, it's by definition an exploit of the mechanics of the game (this originated before the 2000s so no surprise developers overlooked stuff like this all sorts of games).\n\nEmergent gameplay isn't limited to exploiting mechanics, it can be just using the mechanics of the game on a bigger scheme, like luring a nearby predator to a base in Farcry and making it take out some enemies for you... not much on a exploit but rather just a good strategy overall, since animals have all sorts of ways to interact with NPCs and sometimes it's even intended (like when a predator is caged within a base and you shoot the lock to free them, this is clearly a defined path, it's optional the way is clear). \nGlitches aren't necessarily part of emergent gameplay. \n\nWith that said, a valid criticism that emergent gameplay from exploits have is that it's not part of the environment of a game.\n\nThe korean backdash totally changed how the game played out, many moves became safe on whiff and kick attacks of most characters became garbage tier (they fixed those things in subsequent games anyway)\n\nMeaning, the Korean backstep was something that didn't interact with the other elements of the game as the other elements themselves did between them.\nIt's no different than discovering the ancient ballista \"behind the shield\" Marauder cheese. It shows this was clearly not inside the game design because this was nerfed heavily.\n\nSome people argue with basketball: When basketball was invented there was (and is) a rule that you can't run with the ball...\n\nWhat's a good way to go around this limitation? That's right, passing the ball to yourself repeatedly. How? Bounce it on the floor. And that's dribbling for you.\n\n-The catch is that new rules needed to be made so that dribbling became also part of the system of interaction that the rules within basketball had. In other words, adjust it so that it interacts the same way passing does with holding the ball.\n\nThe rules, which stand today:\n\n\"A player who is dribbling may not put any part of his hand under the ball and (1) carry it from one point to another or (2) bring it to a pause and then continue to dribble again. A pass or fumble which touches his backboard, basket ring or is touched by another player. PENALTY: Loss of ball\"\n\n-From the NBA website.\n\nAre there emergent rules to make the Korean backdash adjust? No... i mean, no. Technically buffing other stuff did sort of fix the balance issues, but the lack of limitations on the K backdash are still there even if it doesn't affect the players directly. If a robot did the inputs on a inhuman levels of speed it would shine to light how broken it actually is (it's not like AI hacks and macros already exist but whatever.)\nAnd so, the Korean backdash has a place in the game, yes, but it's limitations aren't clear in comparison to other rest of Tekken's mechanics. \n\nEven combos are emergent gameplay, in Street Fighter 2 people discovered that you could string many moves together, it was broken back then but now we have games that have a whole set of mechanics (rules) that put limits on such system. Like having a stun bar or just a complex stunlock mechanic (GG Strive just to an example). \n\nBunny hopping was balanced in the modern quake games, now you can't go flying 3 miles in the air at will from a flat surface... and the momentum physics in modern quake games is just more arcade-y than Quake 1 so that's that, it's more leniant and pretty much an unnoticeable difference in gunfights. \n\n\n2- Now let's talk about Doom Eternal... :\n\n\nDoom Eternal is the example of a game with great systemic gameplay.\n\nEverything interacts with everything accordingly, in harmony. \n\n*There's no way around it.* You. Fight. Through. Hordes. Of. Demons. Period. \n\nThe closest thing to emergent gameplay was the ballista splash damage cheese for the Marauder... and it was heavily nerfed. \nBHopping is there... mostly useful in speedruns though, in combat it's just not even conventional, it's straight decorative. \n\nCurrently the most emergent gameplay in Doom Eternal that I can think of is... Marauder rocket cheese? \n\nIt still kind of works, but it's still situational at best with how aggresive Marauders can be. Not even Doom Zero or DraQu use it in their runs. (Actually DraQu does use it... in specific speedrun strats). I think it's because it's not very ammo efficient considering you would need half of your total rocket ammo to deal with a single Marauder. So it's only kinda good if the arena consists of a Marauder and other easy squishy demons. \n\nEven then, there's the grenade launcher splash damage cheese, if you're willing to waste more than half of your shotgun ammo on a Marauder that is. \n\nOne could argue that weapon combos are emergent gameplay but... that's more of \"strategic emergence\", if that makes sense, those are more accurately 'microtactics' that help measure enemy health in relation to gun damage. Just like chess has positions that are the best to take.\n\n-Even with all those possible examples of emergent gameplay in Doom Eternal, people who play at high level know that Doom Eternal simply has a systemic game loop. Stuff interacts with each other as it is, without is and buts. No gaps in the rules. No going around rules. \n\nThe most basic element of this a new player would encounter is simply the notion of the movement, the \"doom dance\" if you will. \nThey notice that you have to keep moving in a certain way in order to have higher chances of success. \nOther elements might be demon weaknesses, meaning the weakness to certain weapons that each demon type has, like the Pain Elemental to the ballista. \n\nThe player uses the mechanics of the game with accordance to the interaction it has with the rest of the elements of the game: Glory kills give you health, and so learning when to do a glory kill is an advantage. \nHaving clever ways to use glory kills (like using it to take a breather) is cool, but not emergent gameplay, because that's how the mechanic of glory kill interacts with the demons regardless of your actions... you gain iframes whether you like it or not. \nOnce you start a glory kill animation, you will gain iframes and you can't circumvent this (please don't talk about modders lol, I'm a puny console player).\n\nIt's kinda similar to chess thinking about it, there are only so many possibilities, and they can be mathematically measured. You don't open up options, there are already different routes you can take, and from those routes you encounter others and so on. There are \"meta\" strats, so to speak, in chess anyway. Moving all the pawns to the front regardless of what your opponent does, for example, is not an effective way of using the 'mechanics' of chess. \n\nThe point is, Doom Eternal technically has a systemic combat, but it feels like it's emergent because how many paths the mechanics themselves open up... although the restrictive aspect of the high difficulty gives Doom Eternal the edge. Increasing your effectiveness with ONLY the mechanics the game offers you is a universal aspect of difficulty in videogames, restriction itself implies difficulty to most players.\n\n-Not having freedom and having to succeed with only the card you were handed (the mechanics and the limitations of them). \n\nLook at Sekiro, that game is nigh-uncheese-able. \nThe game actively tells you to *learn how to deal with enemies with the mechanics you have*, your main mechanics are blocking/deflecting, dodging/dashing, spirit emblems (meaning skills and prosthetic skills) and counters (mikiri counter, jumping counter, lightning reversal). In Sekiro you can't go around these, because you need them (and consequently learn to use them) to succeed.\nBosses will test your mastery of each of these mechanics. Just like UN, Master Levels or Horde Mode test your mastery over the mechanics. In Sekiro/Doom Eternal, you don't discover new mechanics, you simply don't... and it works. \nThe game gives you the hand, and you play it. \nThere's no \"cancel this animation with a jump to~\" NO, you just play your hand. Use the mechanics. You have to solve a puzzle, there might be many ways to solve a puzzle, but the tools you have to solve the puzzle are the same... as well as the sl\nsolutions having the same foundation. \n\nDash, quick swap, chainsaw, glory kill, blood punch, flamethrower, crucible/hammer, etc. \n\n(I talk about Doom Eternal but idk about about any other doom game, I played Doom 1993 but I guess it has to have so crazy emergent gameplay on it. So educate me on that one) \n\n3- See, the modern player has an obsession with emergent gameplay, regardless if they know the term. \nThey want borderline sandboxes with \"loose\" mechanics (mechanics with a lot of leniant quality of life characteristics, like lots of frames to cancel an animation) because they're tired of the \"Ubisoft tailored game\" (which Ubi games actually a lot of emergent gameplay but whatever).\nThey ask for games with a lot of smoothness in them, mechanics that lean more on the player's rules rather than the game's rules. Many good acclaimed games are built around this. Anyone who played Dark Souls 1 and Elden Ring knows this difference, Ds1 animations are almost a death trap if you don't time them well, in Elden Ring it's not that of a big deal. \n\nFunny enough, Deus Ex (great games) still not mainstream despite being VERY abundant with emergent gameplay, probably because the game is kind of systemic if you think of it as \"the mechanics of Deus Ex are there specifically to be emergent gameplay\". Deus Ex MD kinda scratched the surface, still not that crazy, despite how insanely good that game is.\n\n\nThis is actually one of the reasons metroidvanias stopped being mainstream, being locked out of areas because \"you can't double jump\" and you have to go acquire it somewhere else (let's not get into sequence breaks... just please). Generally speaking, sequence breaks are almost intended, Metroid Dread has something clear indications of sequence breaks being integrated, something that many players would say it's just non-linear gameplay... i might be wrong, but it can be both in my opinion. \n\n(It's crazy but Elden Ring is more mainstream than Doom Eternal on release lol. A *fromsoft souls game* mind you).\n\n\nA microscopic example of this in the \"great games\" category is God of War 2018, most animations of attack can be cancelled even in *the first frame* of the animations with a dodge or block. This actually lead to a serious cheese exploit of forward dash punch spamming but fortunately is kinda obscure despite being so easy to do. GOWR fixed most if not all of those op attacks btw. \n\nOf course, some attacks can't be cancelled midway (slow, big, high damage attacks and some specific attacks) but the game still has that element of 'looseness'. \nThe reason for the term 'loose' it's because the action snaps easily from the connection it has to other mechanics, in this case the ability to cancel animations easily leads to the mechanic of attacking being loose to the aspect of risk/reward in the game, it's purpose is not clearly defined, why have heavy attacks when you have light attacks that can be cancelled?\n\n Obviously GOW's combat isn't so shallow, I am purposefully skipping elements like enemy types, hyperarmor, spacing, and other things just to illustrate my point. Even while skipping those elements, some games don't have such saving mechanics to complement their combat and actually suffer from that.\nLike COD MW2019 with the broken slide canceling.\n\n- Doom Eternal is one of the few games where systemic combat is far above the standard of combat despite the obsession with emergent gameplay from the population. People are tired of having to adjust from one game's mechanics to another... so, game developers know this and make mechanics very loose, mechanics that work on a vacuum really well, and with questionable effects on the whole structure of a game element. \n\nModern games don't have that 'restrictive aspect ' many older games have (older games in mean 2016 and before). Even Uncharted 4 is relatively very systemic compared to recent games... a game that was considered to have crazy emergent gameplay on it's era lol. Alien Isolation, *Amnesia*, Outlast, Resident Evil and many more games are now considered systemic, when in the past were the ones with quite the emergent gameplay. \n\nEven Hitman is considered systemic lol, when Hitman 3 was released many new players were complaining about the combat being too hard because you died very quickly... when it's just the game telling you that the game isn't about combat and it will never be regardless of how hard the player tries. Even the tutorial itself teaches you to be a master of camouflage, silent, observant, stealthy, etc. It wasn't stupid from that players part because most \"good games\" are very open about player freedom and playstyle variety, but at the same time the dude seemed to have skipped the tutorial and ended up expecting to play an action shooter or something similar. \nJust to show how gaming and players have changed. Stuff is clearly different. \n\nI almost forgot about Shadow of the Colossus, very important in the topic since it's closer to being a systemic game than an emergent gameplay game.\nBut to make the point short, that game has almost no crazy complex mechanics. \nDespite that, there are no \"techs\" or \"emergent mechanics\", none of that, yet they just work so well, in harmony with each element of the game. Climbing has some skippable stuff but overall the player won't be using those, it's closer to being a puzzle game rather than an action game, and solving puzzles with limited ways to do it is fun... right? \n\nI have to mention Ultrakill here, Ultrakill is, to an extent, opposite of Doom Eternal, in Ultrakill you can make stuff work and it works, it's more freedom than restriction. You can abuse the coin but... where's the fun in that? \n\nIf you ask the same question in Doom Eternal it would be \"You can just abuse the super shotgun, but where's the mastery in that?\" \n\n- Ultrakill lets loose, Doom Eternal requires. \n\n\nI'm not saying those mechanics are bad, just setting the differences. Again, those mechanics are fine and I love the combat in GOW and Ultrakill, and whatever game I mentioned. I'm simply, and just simply, pointing out the differences. (God I'm going to get attacked by those points lol).\n\n\n- Back to Doom Eternal, my final point is that Doom Eternal is a \"revolver game\", a game that revolves around it's rules, it's own mechanics, it's own strong foundations. Which is one of the reasons Doom Eternal has such a great systemic combat and will probably remain niche despite it's initial acclaim on release. It stands out from the games that 'made it' because of that reason. \"With little you do a lot\" or however that saying goes.\n\nSystemic games usually if not always lead to the guidance of mastery of the game as opposed to most games with a lot of emergent gameplay. Doom Eternal wants you to master it's mechanics to fully explore what the game has for you to enjoy, for example. Having too much emergent gameplay would mean that the game isn't about mastering dash, quick swapping or glory kills all in harmony, but rather use these mechanics in a vacuum to essentially go around the puzzles that are the combat arenas.\n\nAnd Doom Eternal isn't the only game that's like this, Sekiro, Ghostrunner and Hollow Knight come to mind, but it's certainly not a thing in the industry.\n\nThen again, emergent gameplay isn't wrong, it's actually really good and leads to insanely great games like BOTW, that game *is about* emergent gameplay... most of the time.",
