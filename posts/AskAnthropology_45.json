        "text": "I was wondering this because in English, we use expressions like \"on the left hand side\" even when it makes no sense to refer to hands. There is absolutely no need to talk about hands, yet we do it anyway.\n\nWell in Chinese, they do the exact same thing. They'll say \"zuoshoubian\" to mean left-hand side, even if they're just talking about something on the left. That doesn't seem like it would be a coincidence.\n\nNow English and Chinese are the only languages I know. I can't speak for any other languages, but I know that these two are extremely distant and unrelated, so if there are any similarities between the two that are so specific, it probably means something's up.\n\nAre human beings simply hard-wired to think of their left and right as relating to their hands? Is it because we use them so often, and they happen to be on our left and our right, so we use hands to refer to directions, and this is reflected in our languages?",

So that makes for even less land to put towards straight farming.  \n\nEven more, wiki mentions an italian of the time that visited england, and declared that a 'land so fertile is so underpopulated'.  And finally, I noted that medieval food imports couldn't compare with that of rome in the mediterranean until about 1500 (mentioned by Dan Carlin in his 'punic nightmares part 1' of the hardcore history podcast).\n\nSo how much did natural soil fertility actually affect the yield per acre - assuming medieval/ancient ways of boosting fertility, which from what I know, basically amounts to human/animal fesces?

Does the same person make several hand prints, or are there one per individual? (Apart from the drawing were one person with a crooked finger has painted the outline of a bison with hands) \n\nDoes someone have some kind of clue when the girls had their first menstruation at the time? \nIf they are some kind of initiation, wouldn´t it be possible to be some kind of ceremony of the girls first period?\n\nIn the article it is stated that the hands were very clearly male or female stereotypes according to length of fingers. That probably the genders were more clearly different than today. I have seen that even skeletons just a few hundred years old apparently the male have broader shoulders and more narrow hips etc than today. Is this true even of the skeletons of these prehistoric humans?\n\nI see some believe that people out of Africa started doing the same type of drawings in several continents, while some believe they must have started it in Africa and then continued as they spread out. Is there some agreement on this now?\n\nThere is discussion on why they paint in such remote places as inside caves. What are the thoughts on the idea that they probably painted lots of places, but only the inside caves are left for us to see?\n\nI think the custom we have today, with hunters stuffing the moose they shot and placing it on the wall, might be a continuation / an instinctive follow-up of the drawings of these large animals.\n\nLastly: If you know of a good book that answers all these questions, please tell me! I can read Norwegian, (and Swedish, Danish,) English and Spanish. \nThank you.",

We all tend to behave differently with people we don't know very well. We avoid personal matters and try to appear polite so as to walk on eggshells. Yet we might act distant and not hide the fact that we don't so much care about them.\n\nIn some cultures, this is even reflected in the language. In French, you use \"tu\" when talking to someone close, but \"vous\" with strangers or with people you respect. It's of course more complicated than that, but the point I'm trying to illustrate here is that it's seemingly embedded into people's cultures and languages.\n\nI just read a travel guide on Norway that talks about how Norwegian people dislike making small talk with strangers. They can be rather cold and distrusting of strangers. This piqued my curiosity because I feel like in a low-crime country of five million people, everybody should know everybody. This is, of course, ridiculous. But I'm from a country of over 300 million people for comparison.\n\nThe point I'm trying to make is that maybe in some smaller societies that are probably less advanced, everybody knows everybody. There is no sense of privacy or anything to hide, so people just freely discuss everything and fully trust one another. Sounds nice, right? That's why I'm wondering about such a culture and whether it has ever existed in this world.",

        "text": "Hello,\nI am studying forestry and nature conservation. I am maybe not that well read into environmentalism (the Romantic movement for example) but feel that Christianity and perhaps the Greeks have been very important in how nature and ecosystems are viewed in the West. The balance of nature strikes me as something very Christian and the dichotomy of human and nature too. Both of which I see slowly deteriorating thanks to paleoecology and anthropology and so on. We know that ecosystems change often, that communities of species do not move together, and ecosystems have been influenced heavily by humans. The books 1491 and 1493 by Charles Mann were interesting in this regard.\n\nFrom reading a book on Aztec philosophy it seems that Aztecs and other Amerindians did not see the distinction between human and nature and with Asian cultures it was similar according to that book. I have no clue on pre-Christian Europe, the pre-Islamic East and Africa and Australia. I am about to read a book on how the Aboriginals changed the environment in Australia, maybe it will give me some insight.\n\nSo about that I am wondering. Did they see ecosystems as static i.e. a balanced nature or as changing? Did they see a distinction between human and nature? How was the relationship between them and nature seen? Am I right to think that Romanticism is a Christian offspring? Etc. I have more questions than that, so what I am really looking for is some literature to go through.\n\nThank you for any response.",

I come from a \"hard sciences\" cursus (classes prépa of Physics/Chemistry in France) and have then done a \"BS\" in Math, but for several reasons ended up doing a bachelor in Anthropology. However I started straight in third year, where we started to learn more about our professors' subjects than about the bases, which were covered during the 2 first years which I did not attend. \n\nStill, I passed without too much trouble, and I don't feel like I'll need such readings I ask for in the title for the sake of getting my Master degree since it's mainly a Cognitive Anthropology Master degree, however, I feel like I should at least read some founding texts that I hear regularly in the discussions between other students/professors, that I have a very vague clue of. Mostly because I feel like if I am to become an Anthropologist and do not know anything about those (in France, ethnology being pretty nation-centered, they are namely some Mauss, Levi-Strauss, Godelier...), it might be a problem if I have not acquired some concepts that people consider every Anthropologists have. \n\nI don't know if you get it, but I'm pretty sure I would sort of feel like a \"lesser Anthropologist\". All the more, I believe that it will still help me in my works at some point, and have a broader look at what Anthropology was, and is. Also, reading some fouding Anthropoly works from other countries might be a plus. \n\nSo, \n\n1) as non-French(or even French), which French Anthropologist works do you believe are really part of the \"core\" of Anthropology (even those that might be slightly \"outdated)\n\n2) Same with non-French Anthropologist works \n\nThank you.

If I go to Germany, I could afford more years of study but I have to study from BA onwards.. another 2/3 years..\n\nI am not sure if for consideration of career (research in museum/ archaeology institutions most likely), shall I study another BA in archaeology?\n\nWould choosing a wrong field of archaeology MA program be detrimental to later research path? - I am worried the chance of having chosen a field that turned out not to be my most interested one and it traumatize my later path of PhD (TBC). I have take 2 online courses about Roman period's archaeology, and I love it. But I know I also love Egyptian and other ancient civilization. - simply hard to pick.\n\nIf I dont go for a relevant BA and skip to MA directly, thinking I would would try my best to catch up with the BA readings, am I unrealistic in this?\n\nIs it unrealistic to study classical civilization if I dont know any ancient greek/ latin at all?...",

(I have very little experience with historical and anthropological methods)\n\nFor example the references on the page https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_systems#Non-European_gender_systems are very \"left-wing\" or \"SJW\" sounding. Similar with google search results asking for such evidence.\n\nSo my question: where can I find the raw evidence for the existence of such gender systems that its less easy to be skeptical of.\nAlternatively is MY position wrong and it is in fact correct to be skeptical of such sources.\nor is there a more subtle point that I'm missing.\n\nThanks very much for any help.",

Then, the natural form of the stones used to make the Acheulean bifacial axes might have been what guided hominins (well, Homo erectus) to shape them to the way they are, and a possibly innate preference for symmetry in humans might have further facilitated this creation of symmetrical tools without any needed advanced cognition. Then there's the chaine-operatoire, where a hominin would watch another hominin making a stone tool, understand what purpose it serves, and then imitate it. The capacity to imitate is also present in the great apes, so it is likely that Homo erectus were able to imitate and understand the purpose behind the tools a conspecific was making. A novel trait that would have allowed for producing refined stone tools, obviously apart from the human like hands Homo erectus possessed, is the capacity to train, to rehearse, in order to achieve \"perfection\", something that is absent in the great apes, though interestingly present in song birds, as some have been observed to practice their songs. Eventually a culture or an industry, in this case the Acehulean industry, would come into place without any off-line thinking - without any conception, a mental representation, of the final product. Instead, it would have been produced simply by imitating individuals and figuring out for what purpose these tools could be used. In order words, Homo erectus were able to produce a culture without language and a mental representation of the final product, and with rudimentary \"human\" cognition. Is it possible?",

Of course some things are still a mystery to us, so I have to fill in a lot of the gaps in that regard. \n\nI also plan to make it tell a fictional story on parallel. The two characters are loosely based on Neanderthals. One is called Rocko, he is a foster father of the daughter Adira. Rocko - being concerned with his health - basically teaches her how to fend for herself so that she can survive in the wild. He also encourages her to eventually move on and find a tribe for her own happiness and wellbeing. \n\nI was looking for someone who I can throw ideas back and forth with so I can make the experience more accurate. Everything from the type of rocks bashed together, to the environment and bone structure of the characters. Obviously someone who has a keen interest in this area of history.
