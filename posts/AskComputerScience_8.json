        "text": "Hi, I want to make a presentation in one of my classes and I would like to present the topic of torrents and I would like to read about the technical details, I don't want to only say that torrent is a file you can download from multiple computers, I'll like to say how a torrent file is composed and also I would like to know what is the vulnerability everyone say they have and why is a good idea to use a vpn.\n\nAlso If some could tell me how do I inspect a torrent file, wikipedia says something about the structure of it. It says that the torrent has the ip's of the computers with the file and which pieces it has but how do I see that from a torrent file?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry my English, not my primary language.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Edit**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, I found a tool to see the content of a torrent file, but I have a lot of questions because it doesn't says anything about the location of the archive on my computer or my computer ip to fetch the file. It only says the name of the file, the hash of the pieces and the page where I announce it, ¿then?.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is the torrent I just made:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n    {\n    \n

I am currently leaning on network security because i find it more appealing, but as i said i have no 'experience' with either. \n\nCan someone who has taken a similar path shed some light on what your job involves, pros and cons  and what you would reccommend?\n\nI understand my universitys program may be different from universities in other countries, i just want a general guideline :)\n\nAppreciate all answers :)",

I've made the random number generator with python so far but im not sure where to go to translate the numbers into moving pictures.

I teach programming part time so I’m not inexperienced in this, but there’s a certain attitude as an instructor you can have (such as leaving the slower students in the dust....) that I don’t embrace, but I’m probably a bit selfish in my teaching style and I’m not the most patient person.  I was wondering, if anyone had been through anything similar to this and had advice, and also, if there are recommended resources for learning to code en español.\n\nAnyways, just wanted to get some.

I told the recruiter that gave me the interview that I am interested in a front-end role, but I don't know if that's what the interview is going to be specifically for (though it makes sense to me that it would be?) What do you guys think I can expect?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nObviously I am expecting some algorithm questions and maybe some OOP design, but do you think they will ask me about web application deployment or browser technicalities if it is a front-end interview? also in general, what types of questions do you guys see that are asked to full-time potentials vs interns?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nthanks for any and all input! wish me luck tomorrow :)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT: just in case anyone else with the same question stumbles upon this post, here is some advice I would give coming out of that interview\n\n1. when asked an algorithm question, I would probably just work my way to any solution first (even brute force, don't stress about the efficiency if you don't have an immediate idea that you know will work) and then iterate from there. I messed this up because in the middle of implementing my solution, I kept getting ideas on how to \"make it better\", trying to change it on the spot and ended up confusing myself in the end. If you get new ideas midway, just make a note of it, move on and come back to it later. \n2. it is obvious that being able to efficiently learn things on your own is really important to these people, as some comments say below. the second question they asked me was pretty much to see how well i could stackoverflow things that I didn't already know.

I feel like I don't know what I am doing most of the time. The assembly class was terrific, C++ was not.\n\nA big part of my struggle this semester in my programming languages class (we have to write a lexical analyzer in cpp) is because of my first C++ semester, I had an absolute clown of a professor (and she is \"teaching\" my operating systems class this semester unfortunately). This professor doesn't have a good grip on the material herself so her assignments have very little to do with coding (usually fill in the blank or multiple choice or else she would basically give us an entire program with only a few lines of code to write). \n\nDoes anyone have any recommendations for a good C++ book I can review? The one we used in class is C++ Early Objects by Gaddis, Walters, and Muganda, but its dry. I will review it if i have to, but something more readable would be greatly appreciated!\n\nAlso, if you have any other good resources on coding, please send them my way.\n\nThanks",

        "text": "So when the computer needs data from the ram be it instructions or variables etc it first searches for that data in the corresponding cache (caches). Cache just like the main memory is  divided  into blocks (or lines) that contain a number of bytes. In my understanding whenever we get a cache miss, the computer stores the data plus the neighboring data to the cache. Depending on the scheme used the cache might be fully associative so fetched data can be stored anywhere in it (in any block/line), set associative so data is stored anywhere in a specific set (depends on the main memory block where the data was stored) and it is shared by multiple blocks of main memory, or direct mapped where data is stored in a specific block and the block is shared by multiple main memory blocks. Cache is useful when we have temporal or spatial locality of reference, meaning we use the same data often or we use a set or data that are close to each other in ram.\n\n**1) Did i say something wrong?**\n\n**2) Does the cpu also store the output of an operation in the cache?** Let's say we have the variable X stored in the data cache and the cpu receives the instruction \"add 2 to X\", to do that the cpu has to fetch X, place it in the accumulator, add 2 to the accumulator and lastly store the accumulator in X, to do that we need to know where X is located, so really the instruction is more like \"add 2 to ADRRESS\\_OF\\_X\", so what the cpu does is read ADRRESS\\_OF\\_X and generate a tag that identifies the main memory block where X would be stored, it then searches for this tag in the data cache and if found it uses offset information from ADRRESS\\_OF\\_X to locate where exactly is X stored in the cache line/block. If everything goes well and we have a cache hit the data is moved to the registers and the ALU and the instruction is executed, but then we need to store the output, do we store it back in the cache? Because if not, or not always, then how can we be sure that the cached data is current? Maybe there was another command that was executed the previous cycle that stored a new value in X in main memory that is different from the cached value.\n\nSo if my logic is correct **3) when is the output that was stored in the cache moved back to main memory?** I am guessing that would be done every time that we delete a block from the cache, so basically we take a block from main memory and copy it to the cache for as long as the computer thinks it is relevant or useful to be kept in cache and as soon as the computer decides that the block should be replaced by another, it is copied back to the ram and deleted from cache, am i correct?\n\n**4) In the following example**\n\nwhile(i&lt;10){\n\nx \\*= i;\n\ni++;\n\n}\n\nwhere do we have spatial and where do we have temporal locality? From what i can understand, the instructions that are used are repeated one after the other in the loop, so the instructions have good spatial locality (compare i, move x, multiply, etc) but the variables i and x are accessed multiple times in a short duration, especially i, so we would say that i and x have temporal locality. The cpu would benefit by keeping both the instructions and the variables in the cache.",

From what I am finding online, it seems that the Median of Medians algorithm has a runtime of O(n) when you divide your array into groups of 5 or higher, but has a runtime of O(nlogn) when you divide the array into groups of 3. \n\nI am not understanding why this is. For the sake of simplicity, say A is an array of size n and n is a power of m. We are splitting the array into n/m arrays of length m and performing (m)(m + 1)/2 comparisons for each subarray. Then T(n) = T(n/m) + n/m \\* (m)(m+1)/2. By the master theorem, this is O(n).\n\nIs there something wrong with my logic here? Am I misunderstanding the Big-O speed of this algorithm?  \n\nEdit: a quick clarification. I am trying to write an O(nlogn) Quicksort using the Median of Medians as the pivot. My thinking was that, even if Median of Medians is O(n), with m=3 the pivot selected could still be bad enough that the Quicksort is O(n^2) in the worst case. I was hoping to describe the Big-O speed in terms of m and show that m &gt;=5 is required for O(nlogn).",

On that page it says the following:\n\n&gt; It is unknown at this time whether it is possible to have or create an unsolvable game.\n\nProving that any randomized level in the game can be solved is a little beyond me, but I thought I'd try creating a method that solves a given level. I'm not very good at graph traversal though, so I'm looking for input on how to design the algorithm.\n\nI'm really just looking for pointers here. I took an AlgDat course in college, but it's been a while. Any similar problems you could point me to would also be welcome.\n\nThe rules of the game are pretty simple:\n\n1. There's a 7x4 grid of 28 squares\n2. One square is the starting square\n3. You can move to any adjacent square, even diagonally\n4. Any square you move off of is destroyed\n5. There are potentially six special squares (not all have to appear in a given level); when you move _onto_ one of them, it destroys certain of the adjacent squares:\n  1. Destroys the three squares above itself (north-west, north, north-east)\n  2. Destroys the three squares to the right of itself (north-east, east, south-east)\n  3. Destroys the three squares to the left and the three to the right\n  4. Destroys the three squares to the left\n  5. Destroys the three squares below\n  6. Destroys the three squares above and the three below\n6. The game is won if you are standing on the last square\n7. The game is lost if you can't move to any square (of which there is at least one remaining)\n\nSo the board is basically just a graph where each node is connected like so:\n\n    graph={\n     1:[9,8,2,],\n     2:[10,9,1,8,3,],\n     3:[11,10,2,9,4,],\n     4:[12,11,3,10,5,],\n     5:[13,12,4,11,6,],\n     6:[14,13,5,12,7,],\n     7:[14,6,13,],\n     8:[16,1,15,2,9,],\n     9:[1,17,2,16,8,15,3,10,],\n     10:[2,18,3,17,9,16,4,11,],\n     11:[3,19,4,18,10,17,5,12,],\n     12:[4,20,5,19,11,18,6,13,],\n     13:[5,21,6,20,12,19,7,14,],\n     14:[23,8,22,9,16,],\n     15:[6,7,21,13,20,],\n     16:[8,24,9,23,15,22,10,17,],\n     17:[9,25,10,24,16,23,11,18,],\n     18:[10,26,11,25,17,24,12,19,],\n     19:[11,27,12,26,18,25,13,20,],\n     20:[12,28,13,27,19,26,14,21,],\n     21:[13,14,28,20,27,],\n     22:[15,16,23,],\n     23:[15,16,22,17,24,],\n     24:[16,17,23,18,25,],\n     25:[17,18,24,19,26,],\n     26:[18,19,25,20,27,],\n     27:[19,20,26,21,28,],\n     28:[20,21,27,],\n    }\n\nBut then there are the special squares (and starting square/root node) too. Their locations can vary.\n\nThere are two problems I'd potentially like to solve:\n\n1. Find a traversal of the graph. I'm thinking a DFS with the starting square as the root node, mark each node you step on as \"visited\" and then look at all the neighbors; if one of the neighbors is a \"special square\" then you mark the relevant squares as visited _before_ recursing, and unmark them as you unwind. I haven't actually gotten this to work yet though, mostly just because it's a little complicated and I'm rusty, but let me know if there's a better approach and I'll switch to that.\n\n2. Find the _shortest_ traversal, ie. the solution that uses the fewest amount of steps (since the special tiles destroys other tiles without using any steps). I have no idea how I'd do this, really, haha. My attempts at a classic BFS don't work so well because the special squares can destroy nodes further down the graph. Maybe just the same DFS as above, but make it a generator instead, which yields the current number of steps every time it finds a solution and then unwinds? Any other algorithms to consider?\n\nThanks in advance for any brainstorming!",

        "text": " \n\nI came across a website that shows the live prices that are on the sites like Amazon, Flipkart and paytm(For those of you who are not familiar, Flipkart and paytm big online shopping sites in India.)\n\nAnd this is not just the only one, there are a lot of popular sites like this one. \n\nSo my question does this site scrape these shopping sites on the spot whenever the user searches for a particular product?\n\nOr do they scrape all the products on an hourly basis and update the database?\n\nOr does sites like Amazon and Flipkart provide them with some API which they make use off? I tried looking for such API but did find one.  \n\nHonestly, I highly doubt the first scenario of scrapping the product on the spot as after receiving the product name they would have to send multiple requests to different shopping sites and then scrape them. As this would take a heck lot of time and the load time of this site was pretty low, didn't feel like there was some heavy processing happening in the backend. \n\nAlso if they are scrapping them on the hourly basis, tech giant like Amazon would have definitely tried stopping them. \n\nLink to the site showing product price- [https://www.mysmartprice.com/mobile/apple-iphone-6-32gb-msp12224](https://www.mysmartprice.com/mobile/apple-iphone-6-32gb-msp12224)\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/yd4i7st8kgn11.jpg\n\n&amp;#x200B;",
