The company's HR will extend a formal offer as soon as I tell them which organization I'd like to get the offer from.  \n  \nThe software development role would likely be a mixture of embedded development and testing/automation, in C/C++ and Python. The IT role would likely be some sort of helpdesk/junior sysadmin work, with some scripting as required.

If I'm wrong about any of the concepts, I apologize in advance.\n\nI had an idea and was wondering if it's possible and would it be a reasonable solution to a more secure network in the future.\n\nSo what I've learnt is that ftp and telnet were some of the earlier tools used to access remote machines and that these lacked encrypted security. This also seems common for any new network utilities being created by the average joe coder, and so some of the networking tools always need to be piped(?) through the ssh port for encryption.\n\nIs it possible to include encryption at the firewall level and then any &amp; every port is secure by default?\n\nAny new networking tool, and all of the older tools still in use would now have security built in via the firewall. The configuration for security &amp; encryption would be through one single configuration file at the firewall level. The encryption coding experts could all contribute to the firewall code instead of being spread over different projects requiring security. This means that the encryption security bug fixes would apply to every network tool and not need to be implemented one by one in each different tool. Also each network tool can be written without an encryption specialist making sure the tool is using encryption correctly.\n\nIs this possible or have I over looked something important that I don't understand about the firewall and encryption?",

However, everything I find on the topic of Splunk lite says that it's not a SIEM tool, it's simply a log correlation engine, that can probably feed a proper SIEM tool pretty well.

I was told by the interviewer that I would need to obtain a Secret security clearance for this position. \n\nI have no criminal background, no drug abuse history and an excellent credit. However I feel that I will get denied based on a few factors. I am a naturalized U.S. citizen and a military veteran. My wife however is not a citizen but a legal permanent resident and plans on obtaining her citizenship as soon as her time requirements are met. \n\nThe issue arises with my in-laws. My wife's parents are illegally in the country and my father in law was recently detained by border patrol agents. I posted his bail and he was granted a temporary stay in the country until his case came to a close. Both of my in-laws began staying with my wife and I until a final decision was made by an immigration court regarding my father in law's legal status. \n\nYesterday, a final decision was made and he was given a voluntary deportation with 120 days grace period to get his affairs in order and move out of the country. Both of my in-laws will be out of our house by Monday.\n\nMy question is, will this situation look bad and could it possibly lead to me getting denied a clearance? I have worked really hard to get to where I am and I would hate for it to be for nothing. ",

The answers were all focused on entropy, which I am of course aware of, so I decided to ask this anyway.\n\nAm I off-base?

I was studying for CCNA Cyber ops, but stopped because it prepares me for a role where I already am, and will simply use the books as a relaxing read.\n\nThe question: Which program should be done first: OSCP or Udacity's Full Stack Nano degree? I've done full stack deployments before, but recognize there is plenty I could use more practice with. Considering half the time I am looking for SQLi or XSS, and some Authentication, doubling down with the nanodegree could provide value.\n\nObviously OSCP so that I can have a deeper understanding of attack vectors for my current role, but also for further growth in the event I jump over to Red Team. But which one would provide more value first?",

Even though the error message says encrypt error and that it could be a replay attack, I looked it up and realized it was in all likelihood a false alarm and only caused by packets arriving out of order since I'm always by default over UDP. Most days I never get any packet errors but some days I just get a few, like enough that I can count, and the packet ID numbers were rarely repeated or subsequent. Often times disconnecting and reconnecting would stop it.\n\nBut a couple days ago for the first time I kept getting persistent streams of many packet errors that I couldn't stop or slow down at all. The next day it stopped. But today it started again where I'd get multiple errors every second whenever I loaded a webpage. Despite the lack of evidence pointing to it I couldn't shake the feeling that it was tied to a deliberate attack. I just connected over TCP for the first time, and I haven't gotten any errors since. I understand the difference between the two protocols so that makes since that that'd fix it, but now I'm left wondering is it still indeed safe to use UDP? Are there any possibilities of my real IP being compromised with a ton of bad packet IDs whether or not it's a deliberate attack? I did the advanced test at dnsleaktest.com while I was still on UDP getting streams of errors but it didn't indicate any leaks or compromises \n\nAlso something I just noticed while posting this, the captcha puzzles to create accounts and post were much nicer to me since I switched to TCP. Does UDP make it more likely that I'll get shadowbanned?",

I'm pretty sure Amazon was infected with something similar not so long ago. \n\nhttps://captainaltcoin.com/according-to-a-new-report-egypt-is-secretly-using-citizens-computers-to-mine-cryptocurrency/\n\nSo here's my question.. I'm new to IT and security...I'm not a coder or programmer...yet...but it's things like this that get me interested because I can think of a dozen ways to use something like this in an ethical way that adds value to ppls lives. \n\nHow hard would it be to use a script like this in an app for say a charity. Download this Red Cross app and donate your CPU power to a good cause...or rather than a blogger muddying up their site with ads just allow users to optin to donating CPU resources to compensate the blogger etc. \n\nTo be honest I'm a little shocked that we don't already see this. Maybe im missing something but it doesn't seem like it would be that hard? Thoughts? \n\n",
