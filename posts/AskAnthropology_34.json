He/She also argues that political correctness prevents us from acknowledging that African empires were objectively lesser. What do historians think about this viewpoint? Would this be accurate? If so, why might this be? (Please, refrain from posting Guns, Germs and Steel; there are some useful arguments in that book, but they don't explain everything and they get a lot of things wrong about African history; I'm sure askanthropology is well aware of this, though) \n\nSo, in short: Were African civilizations really \"not as good\" ? I don't think it's fair to compare to them to Rome or Greece or Imperial China, since most Eurasian civilizations couldn't compare to those powerhouses either. So let's try and compare Africa as a whole to the remainder of Eurasia and see where we get. \n",

In it, several contributors mention that the term \"chiefdom\" carries baggage of evolutionary concepts, and that it \"has become devoid of conceptual content...and hardly provides analytical leverage\". Nevertheless, while some of the contributors to that book prefer to use terms like \"middle range societies\", several chose to use the term chiefdom while noting the problem with the term.\n\nI've also started reading *Chiefdoms and other Archaeological delusions* by Timothy Pauketat from 2007, which focuses on North American missippian/woodlands cultures. He argues that the concept of \"Mississippian chiefdoms\" causes archaeologists to assume these chiefdoms were cookie-cutter copies of each other, and to overlook organizational variability.\n\nHowever, in reading [a review for](http://web.pdx.edu/~amesk/pdfs/Ames_Pauketat_Delusions_Review.pdf) *Chiefdoms and other Archaeological delusions*, Kenneth Ames says that despite the problem of typologies masking variability, chiefdoms continue to be a useful label.\n\nMy question is, have archaeologists and anthropologists who study other regions like Polynesia, Southeast Asia, or Europe had this discussion?\n\nHow have North American archaeologists and anthropologists responded to Pauketats argument? Has anyone written in defense of chiefdoms as a typological label? Do scholars writing about social complexity in North America continue to write about chiefdoms while acknowledging the critiques of the concept?",

It's roughly the same size as the United States, and it's geography is very diverse. How much would people in Manchuria have in common with people in Hong Kong and the southeast, or with people in the Himalayas around Tibet, or in the far west near Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan? Do people outside of the stereotypical \"Chinese\" areas in the East identify heavily as Chinese or is their society more regionalized? Obviously Mandarin is the most common language, but are other languages used on a regional level? Would people in the Himalayas have more in common with someone from Manchuria or somebody from Tibet? It just seems from my very limited knowledge of the area that there are quite a few places that are part of China but seem like they would fit in more culturally, linguistically, and racially with other countries. Is that true or am I just dumb? And if it is true, how do the people in these more remote regions view themselves within greater China?\n\nThanks for any information!",

The ideal would be a society where gender difference (and hence gender itself) basically doesn't exist; every individual can do what they like and there aren't any set roles. Or perhaps: gender differences exist but they are as banal and uninteresting as eye-colour difference. Or: a society where there are gender roles but they are extremely loose and unrestrictive.\n\nHow would contemporary Rojava compare? I know they have gender equality written into their laws and have women-only councils and military units, so there's at least a bit of discrimination albeit positive. But I don't know what their social norms would be in, say, domestic life regarding gender.\n\nAlso how would our own modern Western society compare? We are equal in theory (the laws don't discriminate) but arguably not in actuality (few women in positions of power, wage gap, lots of gendered social norms, etc.).",

        "text": "My, my, I loaded that question. But even though I'm blustering in, I hope you can correct whatever false preconceptions I'm bringing to it.\n\nEurope is a very fertile place, right? Looks green to me. But why did Egypt and Sumeria develop these fantastic city-states while Gaul and Iberia just got (at best) Greek and Phoenician and Carthaginian colonies (right?) before the Romans and later Germanic tribes swept in to conquer their local political identities? I'm sure they had cities and settlements, but we don't read about the fantastic Celtic Empire with horses and city walls and literacy and great stone-chiseled Druidic temples the size of the Acropolis. Instead, we read about hill forts, 1000 local tribes, getting conquered by the Romans, then getting conquered by the Germans, then gradually transitioning into Medieval culture once they were unified by outside forces.\n\nI'm aware that Celtic communities were very diverse, but they wouldn't have been in the long run if there were a single power that arose that was powerful enough to solidly unify a whole country, right?\n\nObviously, you could ask the same thing of Russia and the [proto?]Slavic places: why they didn't have their Rome or Egypt even though they have vast swaths of green. I'm just choosing the Celts to get a taste of what produces societies like theirs.\n\nIt seems like high-population city-states are the exception rather than the rule. My instinct says it's just because being surrounded by a desert forces you into a confined area, where you're forced to interact with others and eventually develop a civic administrative culture. There's nowhere to run from local despots, information travels fast, and new identities, responsibilities, living patterns and specializations start to form. Then you get your Tenochtitlan, as opposed to your Great Plains. You start to see astounding building projects that require large amounts of people: then the city starts conquering/settling the countryside and the rest is history.\n\nIf that's the case, though, why did the Germanic tribes end up being more successful at mass conquest than the Celts? Is it because living in a cold climate also forces people together into tighter communities? Is it for other geographical reasons?\n\nWhat drawbacks continuously prevented any one Celtic tribe from spitting out enough babies to get the supercity machine started?\n\nOr am I totally off-track here?",

Apparently, the best predictor of a person's IQ is their parents' IQ, so there may be a strong genetic component to this.\n\nThis question becomes complicated because both upbringing and inherited talent contribute to intelligence. Global IQ has been increasing for decades because of poverty reduction and improvements to public education -- but this might be masking a decline in genetic IQ. I've heard people say that, genetically, Ancient Romans were measurably smarter than modern humans. Is any of this true?",

Without words for numbers, it is impossible to achieve many things. Numbers make things much easier, and you'd think that somebody would have eventually realized the need to keep track of quantities. These languages may have words for \"one,\" \"two,\" \"more than,\" \"less than,\" but nothing beyond that.\n\nI don't want to sound ethnocentric by calling this primitive, but I don't see how a society can thrive like this. There seems to be more resistance against not having numbers than having numbers. It seems so easy to come up with, and I thought it was universal until reading about these people.",
