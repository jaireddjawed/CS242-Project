I have never been able to solve it. I honestly don't know if it even has a solution. When I was first given the riddle, I was obsessed for a while. Then I gave up and life moved on. Every few years I'll remember it again and spend an hour or so drawing it over and over again to no avail. It's been almost 20 years, I feel like an idiot. \n\nI figured if the solution is out there, someone on reddit would have it and end this multi-decade long struggle.  \n\nI'm offering a reward for the first person who can solve this for me.

I just wanted to share these for others for playing in a future car ride or something. These are not riddles you can play by yourself, unlike other posts here.\n\n------------------------------------\n\nPrompt: A man walks into a bar and orders a glass of water. The bartender points a gun at him and the man thanks him and leaves.\n\nFull story: The man had hiccups.\n\n------------------------------------\nPrompt: A man moves a car in front of a hotel and tells his wife, \"I'm ruined\".\n\nFull story: The man was playing Monopoly with his wife.\n\n------------------------------------\n\nPrompt: A man is lying dead in the middle of a desert with a straw in his hand.\n\nFull story: He and his friends were on a hot air balloon when it malfunctioned. They drew straws to find someone who would jump off to lighten the weight, so the man drew the short straw and jumped off.\n\n------------------------------------\n\nPrompt: A man enters a room and turns on the light. After seeing something he commits suicide.\n\nFull story: The man was a lighthouse keeper, and was late in turning on the light. As a result, a ship got shipwrecked and keeper killed himself out of guilt.\n\n------------------------------------\n\nPrompt: A man orders a plate of pelican meat and commits suicide after eating it.\n\nFull story: Him and his wife were on a honeymoon on a cruise when it sank and they became stranded on an island. The man was blinded in the eyes in the accident so his wife searched for food. Finding none, she cut off and cooked her limbs and fed them to her starving husband, telling him it was pelican meat.

After eating real pelican meat, he realized he ate his wife and committed suicide.\n\n------------------------------------\n\nPrompt: A man walks to a lake and asks the villager there if there were any seaweed in the lake. The villager says no and the man takes his life.\n\nFull story: The man was swimming with his girlfriend in the lake a few weeks ago when it become dark and stormy.

Much to each citizen’s amazement, one girl arrived with a plant pot that held only bare soil, resulting in laughter from many citizens and pity from others.
