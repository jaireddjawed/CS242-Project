Do you know of anything darker around the same price range either available at grocery stores or on a website that auto-ships? He likes the really big containers and definitely needs pre-ground for his typical American home coffee machine. He’s very picky so although I’d like to pick something out on a whim I really need advice from the community who’ve tried (and probably hated!) the sort of coffee I’m looking for. Probably important to note my dad is disabled so honestly an autoshipping online one could be a great option in terms of accessibility but just not if it’s too expensive.",

I’m trying to take my coffee game to the next level generally, and am getting a Gaggia classic pro to try to venture into the art of espresso. As much as I’d like to hope I’ll be pulling shots every day, realistically I’ll probably still be using my OXO coffee maker some days before work, and then trying espresso on days I have time or off days. \n\nI have around $5-600 to spend on grinding. If I can get away with only getting 1 grinder that’s real good for espresso and functions ok (better than my previous $60 grinder) for drip coffee, that’d be preferably but if it’d be better to split my money on say a $3-400 dedicated espresso grinder and $2-300 for filter coffee, maybe I’d do that. \n\nI’d love to just go all in on the Niche zero because obviously it’s good for espresso and I figure it can probably still beat my old grinder at drip coffee but I don’t know. I’d appreciate your opinions, expertise, and experience. I’ve also been looking at the baratza sette, and the eureka mignon, baratza encore, and breville smart grinder.  \n\nThanks in advance guys and gals! I appreciate it.",

FWIW I'm in North Yorkshire so use fairly soft tap water. I've cleaned the tank out by hand with hot water / fairy liquid twice but the algae comes back - I realise I'll never get every last spore so manually am going to need a chemical cleaner / algicide to really clear it out.\n\nWhat can I safely use to clean the machine and run through the internals without risking damage or residual flavour in the machine? \n\nI have some Puly Caff Plus cleaner from an old espresso machine but that only mentions soaking the metallic parts / backflushing on it so I'm not clear if it can safely be used on the plastic components given its an Oxygen Bleach. I've also seen other posts online mention Milton Tablets - as this is a chlorine bleach is it ok or will it leave a residual chlorine taste +/- risk damaging plastics?\n\nAny help would be appreciated!",

        "text": "I’m hoping for advice to help choose our next espresso setup. We had a Rancilio Silvia and Rocky grinder for 15 years. We replaced the Silvia with a Lelit Anna PID when it died on us around 4 years ago. We didn’t do much research when picking the Anna and I’ve always disliked it - very hard to get consistent shots compared to the Silvia (especially considering PID), and sluggish when steaming milk. Maybe it was a bit of a lemon, or maybe the Silvia was more forgiving? Either way we haven’t enjoyed it, and now it’s having some mechanical issues so perhaps a good excuse to look for a replacement.\n\nWe make 2 x large flat whites at a time (2 back-to-back espresso extractions then steam milk) approx 2 x per day. We are looking for nice, consistent espresso and silky milk without needing to constantly tinker with settings.  \n\nI’ve started looking and there’s so many options and such huge price range differences that I’m getting a bit lost. Current thoughts/questions:\n\nMACHINE\nCriteria:\n- We’d like to stay under $3000AUD\n- Bench space isn’t an issue.\n- We have 220-240 volt electricity if that makes a difference.\n- we want to be able to do 2 back to back extractions without wait time or annoying extra steps \n- we want to steam milk with no lag after pulling espresso shots\n- ideally be able to fit a larger cup under the group head\n\nI’m currently leaning towards these entry level double boiler machines:\n- Breville Double Boiler. Currently on sale at $1000, usually around $2000. Pros- I’ve read lots of positive things and excellent value for money. Cons- looks very cheap to me and I don’t know if I can get past that.\n- Rancilio Silvia Pro. Around $2600. Pros- We liked our old Silvia, so with PID and second boiler this should be more consistent and faster? Cons- less attractive compared to the original now there’s more black plastic parts around the group.\n- Profitec Pro 300. Around $2900. This looks like a good machine but I don’t know much about it.\n- Lelit Elizabeth. Around $2500. I’m wary of Lelit after disliking the Anna.\n\nShould I put aside my shallow feelings about the Breville and choose it based on price? Am I wrong to focus on double boilers instead of looking at HX? I don’t know anything about them but after a little reading I feel like it could be an extra complication for use and maintenance compared to a double boiler. Is that wrong?\n\nGRINDER\n- can we get away with keeping the rocky grinder for a few more years? Is it pointless getting a slightly better machine if we keep using this grinder?\n- what grinder should we be saving towards that’s a good fit for our espresso needs and good value for money?\n\nThanks everyone!",

I did my regular 50/50 vinegar/distilled water regimen to remove mineral deposits, but it didn't solve the problem. I'm not one to give up on a piece of equipment I'm fond of, and I'm a semi-expert at all things mechanical and electronic, so I tore it apart. Mineral buildup inside the heating element was significant, probably due to the very hard water we have here (including high levels of silica).\n\nBoiling vinegar did literally nothing to dissolve deposits, so I resorted to CLR, which thankfully did the trick. My question is this. For those who may have taken one of these apart before, was the inside of the heating element bare metal or was it coated with something. I found lots of black flakes resembling paint, and the type of metal exposed to water does not appear to be non-reactive. It looks a lot like cheap pot metal, which is not suitable for food grade applications. If this question is better suited for a different sub, please let me know. Thanks all.",

        "text": "Hello, first of all happy holidays, and apologies if this has been debated previously before. \n\nI was wondering about what hand grinder would be the most indicated for me. For some context, I've started getting more into coffee in this past year; I mostly brew pour over coffee (V60 or automatic pour over machine for larger doses) with a bit of Aeropress sprinkled on top, and I've been using a cheap blade grinder for this entire time. I also don't plan on investing into a proper espresso machine in the near future.\n\nI've decided that it's finally time to upgrade my gear a little bit, and a burr grinder seemed like the most obvious starting point. At first I was looking into something like the Hario mini as a cheap entry-level option, but then I grew out of the idea after reading how much of an improvement could be made with a slightly higher budget. So recently I'm focused mostly on 2 options:\n\n*1) 1zpresso Q2*; this'd cost ~80€ including shipping from Amazon.\n*2) Timemore C2*; which in turn would cost ~60€ including shipping from Aliexpress. I considered the C3 instead for ~72€, but it's not available from any warehouse in Europe meaning it'd have to ship from China, so I'm worried about customs expenses bringing that figure to a much higher amount.\n\nI'd love to hear about your experiences with said grinders, and if the 20€ price difference for the 1zpresso is justified. And obviously I'm also open to other recommendations, I've came to this point based on a few hours of research but I'm here for a reason; I'm still kind of lost. Maybe there's a better deal at this price point, or maybe it doesn't even make sense to stay within this budget. On that matter though, I really wouldn't want to go over the 100€ mark for now.\n\nCheers in advance.",

        "text": "Relatively new coffee drinker. I've been cold brewing for about six months now. I drink it black as I am at a diabetic predisposition. My go-to beans are produced by Kalamazoo Coffee Co. which I always purchase in-store. I highly recommend \"Soul of the South\" butter pecan, and \"Moonlight\" maple walnut if you're looking for a subtle flavored coffee. \n\nI thought it would just make sense to order my beans online, so when I Googled K-zoo coffee, I was surprised to see the first result was for a company called Bones. \n\nMy curiosity arose because they market their stuff really well. I love the design of their products, the packaging art is really fun and kitschy, and they have a huge selection of flavored coffees. \n\nI figured since my bag of Kalamazoo beans is running low, let's give these guys a try. Bones offers a variety sampler of your choice. That's five 4oz  packages (20oz in total) of beans for about $35. It's expensive. My go-to brand is $12 for 12oz. \n\nMarketing be damned, I decided to go ahead and purchase it anyway. The five flavors I selected were: Army of Dark Chocolate, Electric Unicorn, French Toast, Chocolate Raspberry, and Salty Siren.\n\nThey were DISGUSTING. Army of Dark Chocolate was the most tolerable but only so in that it was bland. Electric Unicorn smelled so strongly of chemicals that I didn't even bother to brew it, and they all taste weak.\n\nEvery steep I made with these beans caused a weird phenomenon in my pitcher that I've never experienced with any other beans, a weird semi sludgy/dusty film resting on the top of the pitcher, it was sort of gross and needed to be skimmed out. Every steep was like this. I'm thinking it was due to the particular flavorings they use on their beans. I haven't experienced it with other brands. Definitely off putting.\n\nThey also ruined my grinder. After grinding the chocolate raspberry flavor I couldn't get the aroma out. The residual oils from Bones flavoring affected every grind afterward. Pretty big bummer because not only was the coffee expensive, but now I needed a new grinder as well.\n\nI know a lot of people aren't fans of flavored coffees, but if you're curious about Bones - just pass. They aren't good. It isn't worth the money. The only thing they have going for them is their art department, but cute designs and clever packaging don't make a bad cup of coffee taste good. \n\nI've since returned to using Kalamazoo Coffee Co. and highly recommend their beans if you're looking for a flavored coffee that's subtle enough to be a daily drinker but flavorful enough to drink black.",

        "text": "Forgive me, I'm such a newbie. I'm also a little obsessive, lol.\n\nI'm not here asking for medical advice. I am curious about what these medical studies mean when they say \"cup of coffee.\" [https://www.nutritionletter.tufts.edu/ask-experts/q-when-studies-refer-to-cups-of-coffee-or-tea-do-they-mean-eight-ounce-cups-or-the-more-typical-amount-found-in-a-standard-mug-of-coffee-or-tea/](https://www.nutritionletter.tufts.edu/ask-experts/q-when-studies-refer-to-cups-of-coffee-or-tea-do-they-mean-eight-ounce-cups-or-the-more-typical-amount-found-in-a-standard-mug-of-coffee-or-tea/) They said that at least in *their* case, they are referring to 8 ounces of coffee. \n\nI see lots and lots of blog posts from roasters that talk about something like 2 tablespoons (approx 10 grams) per cup. What I worry about is if some medical researchers are assuming that a cup is much weaker than these amounts we often see mentioned by \"coffee people\" and that we're all actually consuming far more \"cups of coffee\" (by medical standards) than we think we are. (I know it depends on the study, the country the study was done, the year, etc.) \n\nI guess I'm asking is do \"regular\" people who just throw some grounds of Folgers in their Mr Coffee use something like 10+ grams of coffee per 6-8 ounces? Or do they often drink their coffee weaker? Are some of these studies possibly using a weaker \"cup of coffee\" as the standard, and how much does this standard differ from James Hoffman, Starbucks, and your local coffee roaster?\n\nWhat got me down this rabbit hole was a study that said \"X cups or more is bad\" and I thought \"I'm safe, I don't drink that much!\" but then I wondered, \"what do THEY think constitutes a cup\"? It's aggravating. Can we ever know? How seriously should we take these studies when they give nebulous \"cups of coffee\" statements?",

So I'm not sure what to use I don't want to use tap water because I feel like all of the minerals in the water could alter the taste. As well boiling it would take to much time for me because sometimes I have to work in the morning and I often rush so it would be hard. So what water do you guys recommend?",
