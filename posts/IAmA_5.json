I have two seperate vaginas (one labia and clit) each vagina has its own reproductive system that angles outwards towards each hip. On each vagina I have a cervix, uterus and only 1 ovary attached.\n\nI posted on here a few years ago actually when i was an escort here in Australia (where in person sex work is completely legal) and I was able to use one for work and keep one for my boyfriend. Haha it worked well for us, emotionally and physically made work a lot easier. It definitely had its advantages\n\nAny who since then Ive had 2 babies from my right side via c section, both babies extremely small. I want another baby but we have to use my left side ive been told and unfortunately i dont orgasm from this side often so im rethinking my decision! I 'm now married though in an open relationship, and we make content together.\n\nI drew a pic of it to make more sense Ive had a couple of people ask If i can do an AMA! And yes this is 100% real I have a photo of both uteruses taken during my c section and have provided medical records. Theres also videos online. So clearly I cant lie about this.\n\nAsk me anything ❤️\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/u3ljCS3](https://imgur.com/a/u3ljCS3)",

The was a new tumor in a lymph node in my belly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter undergoing:\n\n* 3 cycles ob PEB chemo therapy\n* 2 cycles of preparation chemotherapy for...\n* 3 cycles of high dosage chemotherapy \n\nI was out of options, regarding any more platinum-based chemotherapy. \n\nNext step was to remove the primary tumor in a risky operation where I was cut up completely from under my belly button all up to the base of the sternum.\n\nAfter the main tumor was removed (and a pretty shitty recovery) there was a sharp increase in ß-HCG. The cancer had spread to lungs and liver. \n\nLast option - experimental mRNA Study by BionTech. With my history I was the perfect candidate and got (at least it felt like that to me) fast-tracked where possible. I should have gotten my mRNA cells back this Monday (30.1.23). But in a routine scan shortly before treatment begin, even in the CT-Scan of my brain at least six metastases could be located, a few of them even with 1.4cm in diameter. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo get rid of those it would take 3 weeks of brain radiation, and another 2 weeks where i cannot be treated with anything else.

But the staff of the brand I bought answered all my doubts patiently and comprehensively. They are shipped with great care and a storage bag is included with the purchase of the large doll, which is very convenient. They also sell a lot of gadgets for using the doll, cleaning the doll, and maintaining the doll.\n\nI initially felt very ashamed of using such a product, they let me join their reddit community and telegram, and in the process of communicating with other people, I learned more about sex dolls.\n\nI've grown to love [my doll](https://i.imgur.com/U7cKdaZ.jpeg), she's so lifelike, like a real companion. I wear different clothes for [her](https://i.imgur.com/UUNfKE9.jpeg) every day, and share them with you [here](https://i.imgur.com/vbT6e1A.jpeg).\n\nThe purpose of writing this article is to hope that more people like me who dare not try sex dolls can bravely accept it.",

        "text": "Meet Matilda! This beautiful girl, who is almost 2 years old now, was born with kidney disease. Matilda needs a kidney transplant to make her better.\n\nEvery night, Matilda is hooked up to a dialysis machine to remove toxins from her body. This machine does the job that a healthy baby's kidneys would do, although not as well. You see, Matilda was born with multicystic dysplastic kidney disease, which prevented the normal development of both of her kidneys.  She is basically living life with no kidney function.  She will need multiple transplants in her lifetime for her to live a long, healthy life.\n\nAnyone living in the United States can be a kidney donor for Matilda. \nA living donor's kidneys work longer and better than those from a deceased donor.  And now, Matilda is old enough to accept a kidney from an adult donor. \n\nEven if you aren't an exact match to donate your kidney to Matilda directly, there is a program that allows Matilda to benefit if you donate a kidney to one of the many kidney patients that are in need of a transplant.  It is a voucher program that will put Matilda to the top of the recipient list, if you donate in her name.  And, just think, in this way, you are actually helping to save two people who have kidney disease.  \n\nAnd yes, you can live a healthy, normal life after donation. Many people in this world have only one kidney and most never even know it!  Please donate your spare kidney to Matilda or one of her many friends who are children in need of a transplant.  \n\nInterested in getting tested to be a living kidney donor? It's totally free! Remember, if you aren't a perfect match for Matilda, she can still get a kidney through the voucher program if you donate in her name. \n\nDonating your kidney today will bless Matilda with a long, healthy life.  \n\nContact Mom (Molly) @ 912.269.0577\nand \nSee if you can donate @ https://www.kidneyregistry.org/",
