        "text": "Hey guys, I have a pretty extreme yet ironic tale to share with you that happened not long ago. I work in a branch of one of the largest IT companies in the world on their service desk that assists in the running of a very large fried chicken chain. Now for anyone who has done this type of job with fast food places especially you will have heard some pretty crazy shit from the stores, but this, this sends all the other stories quite literally up in flames. \n\nSo I'm doing my thing, typing away and wishing for home time to hurry up when a call comes in from one of our stores located in the north of England. Conversation goes as follows:\n\n\nMe: Service desk, how can I help?\n\nStore employee: Yeah you alright there mate? This sounds really bad but we need all our stuff replaced.\n\nMe: Oh? Why what's happened?\n\nStore employee: So I came in this morning to open up, the place is absolutely trashed, checked the CCTV and we were broken into. The guys stole our tills, PC and safe.\n\nNow in this situation we had to get one of our delivery managers on the case to get all the stuff replaced, they had an engineer out to install all their equipment and all was good. Until the day after.\n\n\nI was sitting there doing the same tasks I do every day when the exact same store called in, trust me this gets juicy.\n\nMe: Service desk, how can I h-\n\nStore employee: THE STORE IS ON FIRE\n\nMe: I'm sorry?\n\nStore employee: THE FUCKING STORE IS ON FIIIIRRE!!!\n\nMe: How has that happened??\n\nStore employee: WE WERE SERVING AT THE DRIVE THRU AND A BURNING CAR ROLLED UP IS BURNING UP THE WINDOW. SEND SOMEONE OUT TO LOOK AT THIS PLEASE\n\nMe: Miss, you've called the IT service desk, call the fire brigade before you call us, better yet grab a fire extinguisher while you're at it!!\n\nStore employee: *BANG* FUCKING HELL *line goes dead*\n\nTurns out or delivery manager was listening to the entire call. \n\nLater on we found out the bang was caused by the employees using the wrong kind of extinguisher and ended up making the fire worse and nearly caused a small explosion from the fire nearly reaching the fryers. The incident even made the news.\n\nLuckily no one was hurt in the end and we got all their stuff replaced again, there was suspicions that someone had physically lit the car on fire then pushed it through the DT but the police determined there was no foul play after a lengthy investigation. I just don't know why the lady thought the first thing to do was to call the IT service desk while their lives are potentially in danger.",

        "text": "Even though no phone calls are involved, this did take place in a call center. I just overheard this conversation and felt it was worth sharing.\n\nContext: The phone reps and management just did a versus Jeapordy game together. The phone reps smoked the supervisors and managers (in jest, the senior manager even began bowing to the phone reps/winning team). It was lots of fun, lots of laughs and all in good humor.\n\nHowever, at one point, one of the phone reps who wasn't a contestant was really excited about knowing the answers and kept blurting them out (nearly costing the phone reps points). One of the supervisors who was overseeing the game shouted, in a humorous tone, for him to \"shut up\". Everyone, even the phone rep, laughed because contextually it was hilarious. Everyone moved on and management got destroyed.\n\nNow, the short but sweet conversation I heard afterwards. The phone agent who kept blurting out answers sits near me, so I overheard the supervisor who told him to shut up come over and apologize. The phone rep had never been offended, and had found it humorous, and even appreciated the supervisor for trying to save his team points. But the supervisor still wanted to apologize because technically it was rude.\n\nEveryone's happy and back to working. There are some quality people out there.",

While I do this, can you tell me what device you're currently using to connect to your WiFi?\n\nCx: An IPhone 7.\n\nMe: Okay, thanks for the info, I'll go right ahead into the modem.\n\n. . .\n\nMe: Okay, it seems like your device is already connected to the modem -- I see an IPhone here, and given that I'm able to access your modem remotely, your modem is also online as well.

I just want to connect to my WiFi network. It still keeps loading a blue spinning circle next to the message.\n\nMe: Rest assured, that is just normal behavior, indicating that your phone is attempting to read out the WiFi networks in your area to just detect which WiFi networks it can attempt to connect to. You are actually connected to your WiFi still, which you can see as the name on the top of the list over there with a checkmark.\n\nCx: (not understanding), but I'm still not connected to my WiFi, this shouldn't be doing this. Is my phone broken?\n\nMe: No, again it's just normal behavior, becaus-\n\nCx: I don't understand you, but okay, if you say so. I'll... just give a callback if this still happens.\n\n*Sigh.*",

I want to schedule this surgery but keep hitting roadblocks and they keep asking for more and more appointments. \n\nM: (checks the patient's insurance and the clinic procedure). So you have Medicaid correct?\n\nP: Yeah and I've been trying to get this surgery scheduled for a year and they've literally had me do 40 appointments this year and now they want a seminar? Getting them to schedule this is like a full time job. \n\nM: I understand. Since you're on Medicaid you'll need to get a referral from your primary care provider as is the requirement of the insurance. The next step after that will be an online seminar. You'll need the referral first though because the seminar completion will be tied to that referral. \n\nP: This is ridiculous! I shouldn't have to jump through this many hoops. It's a waste of tax payer dollars to keep doing all this. \n\nM: I apologize but the referral is a requirement of your insurance and the seminar is a clinic requirement. After that generally the clinic will have a check list of other things they'll require before they can schedule you for surgery so it's best to get started asap. I can provide you the clinic fax number so you can have your primary care provider fax over the referral.

        "text": "The following story kind of belongs here even if I never worked in a callcenter. Read and you will understand...\n\nNo need for introductions cause there are only two acting persons in this tale. Enjoy!\n\nMany moons ago there was a magazine for introducing and reviewing consumer electronics (I won't disclose the name of the magazine due to privacy reasons). At the time, this magazine had an ongoing contest for readers. To participate, you would send in your personal short review of a rather newly released DVD. If your review was chosen by the editorial staff, you would not only win an entry level surround loudspeaker set, they'd also print the review in the magazine along with your name.\n\nSince I always liked to write stuff, I sent in a review and actually won! I found out when I bought the new issue of the magazine and, lo and behold, found my name and my review in it. Unfortunately they hadn't only printed my name, but also my full telephone number (this was at a time where privacy wasn't such an issue yet). I was slightly irritated by that, but after all I had just won a loudspeaker set and had my own work published, so I didn't really care.\n\nOn a lovely summer's day a few weeks later, my telephone rang. The following conversation ensued:\n\n**Me**: Hello?\n\n**Caller**: Yes, hello? My name is Mr. *Caller*. I have a question about televisions and wondered if you could help me with this?\n\n**Me**: Uhhhh ... sorry, I'm a little confused. What are you asking about?\n\n**Caller**: I read something about a television you reviewed in your last issue and have a question about it.\n\n**Me**: Ummm ... sorry, I'm still unable to follow you.\n\n**Caller**: I am talking to the magazine *name of magazine*, right?\n\n**Me**: No, you are talking to *my name*\n\n**Caller**: Oh ... but I called the phone number printed in the magazine!?\n\n*It finally dawns on me here*\n\n**Me**: Okay ... yeah, well, I had my review of a DVD printed in that magazine along with my phone number. Is it possible that you found the number you dialed in that review?\n\n**Caller**: I'm not sure. I just have this question about televisions, so I opened the magazine and dialed the first phone number I found.\n\n**Me**: Well, then I guess you accidentally found *my* number. Sorry, but I can't help you. Please check the magazine again and find the number of the publishing house.\n\n**Caller**: Sure thing, thanks! *click*\n\n\nI was baffled. I understand that technology can be difficult to understand, so sometimes people might be confused. But how can you be so dense to just fling open an 80+ pages magazine and dial the first phone number you come across? \n\nThe magazine is full of advertising and reviews, so you will find telephone numbers of manufacturers and shops plastered all over it. It should occur to the reader that most of those numbers will not connect you to the publishing house. To this guy, although he came across like a nice chap, it clearly didn't. Some people...",

        "text": "So this is a tale for when I worked in bill pay support.\n\nSo some background some of you may find interesting.  Very few banks provide their own bill pay services to their customers.  They pay a company like mine to do all the programming, and then pay for different levels of support.\n\nNow some banks do not want to give us full access to the customers bank acounts.  So we offer what is called trust payments.  So when a customer makes a payment we \"trust\" them to have the money in the account.  We send our money first and then request a debit on their account.  Now to protect ourselves there were limits on the size of payments you could send.   There are issues but generally few people notice.\n\nThis tale has to do deal with  our private bill pay service you sign up for independent of any bank, but are allowed to us any bank account.\n\nSo this guy calls and wants to raise the limit of the size of his payments he wants to send.    So I go about the procedure of filling out the forms that get sent to our risk department.  Generally they were capped at $10,000.  But I saw some customer raise them to $100,000.\n\nNow this guy wants his to 10 Million dollars.  I stop and explain the trust system our payments use.  Pretty much he is getting up to a ten million dollar loan for each payment.  He balks at the idea he would be denied.  But he loves our product and wants to be our best customer ever.  I try to give him the expectation that he will be denied that high of an amount, but it will still be raised.  He is confident that they will approve him and I submit his request and tell him in 2-3 days they will come back with an answer.\n\nSo he calls back everyday checking his status.  Keep in mind he is super nice and pleasant to deal with.  My coworkers are all entertained with this guys request as everyone knows his request is not happening.  \n\nSo a week later I get him again and he is a little annoyed, but still a pleaseant caller.  His rate dollar amount was raised to 250,00.  I was very impressed they got this high.  But he is not satisfied and asks me to fill another request for him.  I see that this is his 4th request. But this time he settles for 1 million dollars.  \n\nI try to explain again why it will not happen.  He asks me why and I made a mistake.  I told him we charge 10 dollars a month to do this for you.  The possible loss of millions if someone gets into your account is not worth it for such amount.  So he thinks he can change our pay structure too!\n\nA month later I get another call from him and he is requesting attempt to raise his limit. His history had too many attempts to count.   He actually remembers me by name and he thinks of a few other reasons for me to add into his request.  \n\nIt has been 5 years and he is the only customer that I can remember their name. \n\n",

She missed her appointment at a hard to get into clinic because the clinic never sent her an appointment reminder and we couldn't schedule her for another few weeks. She was crying uncontrollably. \n\nI ended up transferring her to a nurse's line who was amazing. She calmed her down and was so caring and such a lovely human. I felt so bad for this lady.  \n\nIn the end, I think she'll be okay and the patient thanked both me and the nurse for showing her that people do care and for helping her out.

There are transactions happening at the same time in her home state and in my most common fraud location, Jewelers in Dubai.  \n\nSo I start going over all her activity confirming what is hers(I know before I ask, but protocol).  Now our system blocked at point of sale all the fraud.  This bank also would overnight you a new card.  So This very pleasant lady asks me how much money the bank lost on the fraud.  I tell her none.  This is where the call goes to hell.\n\nImmediately nice pleasant old lady starts screaming at me for blocking her card without her permission first.  At first I am confused that she thinks we might have stopped one of her payments,  But No!  This lady understood we stopped fraud and was upset we stopped that first without asking her.  \n\nSo I start trying to explain how we could not possibly have the logistics to call people while waiting at the swipe to verify a transaction, but she does not care.  She is super rich and now is talking about how she could buy me and everyone in my family.  How we have to cater to her and her every whim.\n\nEventually she swears at me enough to where it is easily harassment I transfer her to a team lead out of state.  Generally I disliked the other state leadership in our company.  They viewed us as competition and would always take a customer side before listening to the recorded calls(I won all 3 of my write ups they gave me because of that).  Now this team the lead comes back to me.  Says this super sweet old lady turn into a dragon because she could not only fire me on the spot, but haven me dragged forcefully out of the building.",

[R pulls up the referral and it's declined because they're booked out months in advance and the reason is marked as no timely appointment available.] It looks like this clinic doesn't have any appointment openings so your referral was rejected. You should get in contact with your doctor to go over your options to refer you elsewhere. \n\nIG: can you schedule me anyway? It's not an emergency. I can wait. \n\nR: I'm sorry but I can't schedule you. This referral was rejected because we don't have any timely appointments available. \n\nIG: it's okay! I'll wait. \n\nR: I really can't schedule you. This clinic is scheduling very far in advance. \n\nIG: I'll wait!\n\n(I won't bore you. This keeps going back and forth pretty much the same thing over and over for a good 20 minutes.) \n\nR: Sir, I really can't schedule you. This clinic is booked out as far as I can see which is two months. \n\nIG: so you can get me in in a month?\n\nR: *facepalm* no. I can't get you in. I can't schedule you. \n\nIG: can you call the clinic to schedule me?\n\nR: No. The clinic. Is booked. They rejected. Your referral. \n\nIG: we'll tell them I'll wait. \n\n[finally rep relented and said she'd send the clinic a message that this guy was super insistent about waiting. She told me after the call that the clinic wouldn't even consider reopening his referral because they're most likely booked a year in advance and his referral would expire and he'd have to start over again. But she'd let the clinic tell him that since he wasn't going to listen to her. \n\nIt was pretty painful to listen to. ",

May I please have your 16 digit card number?\n\n&gt;Cardholder (CH): *15 digits*\n\n&gt;Me: I didn't get all that. May I please have the last 8 digits one more time please?\n\nThere are only several combinations of the first 8 digits our cards can possibly be, so if I can't find a card in the system I will typically just ask for the last 8 digits so they wouldn't have to repeat the whole card number.\n\n&gt;CH: Okay, I'll repeat the whole number again. *This time she only says 13 digits.*\n\nThis repeats for about five minutes until she finally gives me the correct number. She's trying to activate her card, but in order to activate the card, you have to enter in the 16 digit card number into the automated system and then validate the 3 digit security code on the back and enter a PIN. I explain this to her and then she gets frustrated that I can't activate her card for her. She eventually hangs up to try again\n\nMy next call was with a woman who wanted to know the status of her fraud dispute which is handled by tier 2. Since tier 2 was in queue (or there was an error in which the phone system will leave me on hold forever and then I would have to reconnect and try again to reach a tier 2 agent), I peaked over to the girl that sits next to me and lo and behold she's dealing with the woman that I spoke with previously (I knew this because the number she was trying to enter was similar to the one that I kept trying to input). To make her time easier, I gave her the card ID number (the other number we use to identify cards because after pulling up a card account we can't see the full 16 digit card number) to pull up her account. While I was waiting for tier 2, I happened to notice that she once again had to explain to her that we can't activate cards, only the IVR or website can activate cards. She requested a supervisor which pissed off my co-worker because she was about to leave in two minutes and it typically takes about 10-15 minutes to reach someone to take over the call. Luckily for her, the cardholder hung up after about three minutes.",

You didn't ask yourself why you could only find this device in the US? 2. You most likely didn't explain that you were using this in a different country when you bought it. 3. Even if you did, I don't blame the 17 year stock boy at Gander Mountain for not knowing Canadian law. It's your responsibility to call us and ask.\n\nMe (actually): I'm sorry, but we're not going to break the law for you.\n\nCustomer: I think I'll go online and share this negative experience!!!\n\nMe: That's fine. Have a good day.\n\n\n\n",

What do you want to know?\n\nShe ended up asking about his job and what he does and does he like it, or find it rewarding.

Preface: I work for a telematics company (think OnStar for those not in the know, but obviously no spoilers as to where I work). The most important thing to know for this story is that anything which physically involves their vehicle needs to be handled by someone at their dealership, but that doesn't stop people from asking us all the time. Anyway...\n\nHere's what I know prior to accepting the call:\n\n* Angry Customer (AC from now on) had a DUI and no longer has his driver's license.\n\n* AC no longer has the key to his vehicle.\n\n* AC needs to tow his vehicle somewhere.\n\n* AC's dealer won't make him a key without a valid driver's license.\n\nAt this point I accept the call.\n\nTE: Good morning AC, this is TannerEvil a supervisor at &lt;brand&gt;, I understand you're having difficulty getting your vehicle towed.\n\n**AC: Yeah, so I lost the insert for my vehicle** (Does he mean the key? I think he does.) **so I can't get it started, and I don't have my license anymore. I went to my dealer to ask them to make me a new key and they say I need my license. It's not my fault I don't have a license and it's not like I want to drive the vehicle, I just need it towed. I just need someone to make me a f$&amp;%$! key. Just make my key. Please just get someone to make my f$&amp;%$! key...**\n\nThis continues for awhile, him just ranting. I try a couple of times to interject myself \"Sir...\", \"I understand...\", \"I'm sorry sir, I just need to...\" but each time I'm cut off and he continues to rant. At one point he actually lets me talk and I say this much:\n\nTE: Again, I'm very sorry sir. Here at &lt;brand&gt; we're responsible for the telematics unit in the vehicle.\n\n**AC: Whatever the f&amp;%$! that means. I just need my key. I need my f$&amp;%$! key. Please just...**\n\nThe rant begins again. After some more time I get another chance to speak. It becomes clear to me from his patter that he thinks he's just going to continue to escalate all the way up the corporate ladder until he gets someone to meet his demand (since that ever works):\n\nTE: Mr. AC, I apologize you're not speaking with corporate. I think you're probably looking to speak with someone from our customer assistance center located in &lt;place&gt;.\n\n**AC: Yeah fine, hurry it up.**\n\nI got over to that department and spoke with a nice woman there. I apologized in advance and gave her the rundown, she let me connect him promising to explain their policies to them. We're not trained in those policies, but I assume AC probably didn't find it very helpful.\n\nEdit: Formatting.",

Give me the code character for character like a normal person would read a code of numbers and letters.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nOur system is designed to not generate a confirmation code that might actually be a real word, just to limit the procurement of words that may be offensive in a romantic language. Makes sense. Regardless of this every now and then you get someone with a confirmation code thats generated just enough letters to pronounce something that sounds normal. The thing is, I still need you to give me the confirmation code properly.\n\n\nLady calls in and I ask for the confirmation to get started:\n\n&gt; its 1...7...CENO\n\n\"Im sorry could you give me a word for each letter please?\"\n\n&gt; its... 1 like the number one, 7 like the number seven...CENO\n\n(**really...ma'am I dont know if you are saying SENO/CINO/CENO/SINO/C-N-O like stop being a fucking moron and read me the code please**)\n\n\"Ok maam sorry for not being clear, for each letter in the code do you mind giving me a word?

I call over to my help desk, beg them to help me figure this out, I really want to keep this call...and they do. We find her ticket...she purchased it from another fucking airline. Confirmation code is for the other carrier. Stupid twat. She literally called the wrong airline to bitch about something the other airline did. I'm about to let her ass have it. Also, appears that she's had a schedule change to her outbound flight and will be delayed unless the other carrier finds a more suitable flight. So I click back over:\n\n\"ok maam i do have your (other airline) ticket pulled up here looks like we were using the code for a different airline but no problem, I see your outbound flight was cancelled by them ~~smiling through phone~~ and it looks like they have you leaving about 5 hours after your original departure, sorry about that one, I do have a number here for the...\"\n\n&gt; AUGAYFAIIUTIWTTWGBFGSJSKFYSJGFJHJSHFSGIFYGFDH\n\n\"Sorry.

These cards have the option to be converted to prepaid debit cards (AKA personalized cards) that earn rewards points at a certain grocery store chain. When a customer calls in to activate a temporary card, after activation they are sent to a representative who will offer them to either register their temporary card to enable it to make online or phone purchases or to apply for the personalized card. This particular day I had a cardholder (CH) who decided to be difficult with me when applying for a personalized card.\n\nSo after the standard getting I ask for her name and she just gives me her first initial. After verifying the original load amount I offer to convert to a personalized card. She accepts so I begin the application process by reading this disclosure\n\n&gt;Me: To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, Federal Law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify and record information that identifies each person that opens an account. What this means for you, when you open an account we will ask your name, address, date of birth and other information that allow was to identify you. So may have your name please?\n\n&gt;CH: *Spells out a very common name*\n\n&gt;Me: Thank you so is [common pronunciation of common name] the way you would like for your name to appear on the card.\n\n&gt;CH, yelling furiously: No it's not pronounced [common pronunciation], It's pronounced [Another pronunciation that basically moved the stress from the first syllable to the second syllable and changes one of the vowel sounds]. Just because it's spelled like [common pronunciation] doesn't mean it's pronounced that way\n\nDamn, if you were going to get pissed that I pronounced it differently you could have told me how it was pronounced when you spelled it out.\n\nOf course the difficulty doesn't end here. One of the required pieces of information for the personalized card is the social security number. We have verbiage for when they don't want to give the social security number, but in this case she tried to tell me that she didn't have to give it based on the verbiage we use when we asked for it. So here's how it went down.\n\n&gt;Me: In case your card becomes lost or stolen, we use your social security number to verify you are the person calling for assistance. May I have your social security number?\n\n&gt;CH: I don't ever plan to lose my card so I don't have to give you my social security number\n\n&gt;Me: Well, we still need it for identity verification purposes. \n\n&gt;CH, once again yelling furiously: You never said that! You said \"In case your card becomes lost or stolen, we use your social security number to verify you are the person calling for assistance.\" I am never going to lose my card so why do you need it?\n\n&gt;Me: I also said \"Federal Law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify...\" [she cut me off here, but I was going to say a social security number counts as identifying information]\n\n&gt;CH: You said that at the beginning of the call before you even asked for anything! But whatever my social security number is..\n\nAfter that everything went smoothly. The card was successfully ordered and she was satisfied. I dread what would have happened if our system was unable to verify her identity.",

So his mortgage was late and now his interest rate has hiked and all this horribleness will cost him hundreds of thousands of dollars and destroy his credit.\n\nSo I begin researching.  Everything you do on the bill pay has a times tamp of what they did.  So it takes a while because he was fitzing with things over and over.  it turns out he had an autopay rule setup to pay his mortgage and he was adjusting the dates for whatever his reason was.  So this autopay rule schedule the payment he wanted made.  So it showed him a payment was ready to be made.  He then cancled the autopayment rule and a it asked him if he wanted to cancel all payments associated with this rule.   He clicked yes.  He then reschedules the autopay several more times for the following month canceling it and remaking it since the late by date was on a holiday and we could not get it there on that day.  \n\nThinking everything is good he leaves it so right now he canceled his mortgage for the current month and set one up for the following month. Uhh ohh.\n\nSo I go through everything he did and he agree with me.  He acknowledges every step as i recreate what he did that day.  He is impressed I was able to figure this out exactly, but then he starts talking to himself and it goes something like this.\n\nWOw, I am a surgeon.  I can not believe I made such a simple mistake.  People die when I make mistakes.  I have never killed anyone on my table yet.  I could not have done this.  I have never killed anyone before.  I do not make these stupid kinds of mistakes.\n\nI am sitting there picturing the train of this customers shit about to run me over. Sure enough he goes from rational cool guy, to batshit crazy accusing me of sabotaging his life after this brief monologue.\n\nEventually after tearing my ass out he calms down, and I ask if he wants me to explain it to him again.  He is calmer now and maybe he just needed to get that out of his system.  So a second time I explain his steps and he calmly agree a second time.\n\nThen the monologue starts over, and he goes batshit crazy a second time.  Teaching me a new term gas lighting.  As he accuse me of trying to make him think he is crazy.  \n\nI now give up and offer to submit requests to reimburse him(knowing they will be rejected) just to get this guy off the line.  After taking more abuse and having me fill his request he lets me go.\n\nEdit*corrected the autopsy mistake.",

Since I am the last tier that can be reached I normally get people arguing with me who are convinced they are right because they work networking or do some sort of IT role. We will refer to network engineer as (NE).\n\nMe: Hello thank you for calling Big ISP how may I help you today?\n\nNE: Yes my internet service is currently down right now. I already did all the troubleshooting needed so obviously its an issue on your end. \n\nMe: Sure lets take a look into this.\n\n(I begin to pull up his information and see that his customer owned modem is currently offline. Offline for roughly 4 hours. I checked his area and no indications of an outage.)\n\nMe: So sir I see your modem has been offline for a few hours here and I can't find any indication of an outage. I can see if we can get your modem online but if not we likely will need to send a tech out. Can you please disconnect the power and coax cable from the back of the equipment.\n\n(He starts to rant and rave that he has already done this and to not waste his time.)\n\nMe: Sir understand you may have already done that on your end but this will be different as I will be doing a few things on my end to help get connected.\n\n(This is honestly a lie, but i often use it to try and get people to cooperate with the basic troubleshooting steps needed like a reset.)\n\nNE: Listen I am an network engineer and I KNOW its on your end. Let me to talk to someone who manages your DNS server. Its likely my mac address is not registering on your end.\n\nMe: Well actually sir we are not getting signal to the equipment so we are likely looking at possible wiring issues outside your home.\n\nNE: IMPOSSIBLE! We had a tech out here not too long ago and the wiring is BRAND NEW. You don't know what your talking about.\n\nMe: Even if that is the case there could still be many variables that could affect signal in such a short time. Something at the tap could be causing this, damage to cabling, or simply a bad splitter. \n\n(We continue to argue for 10 minutes and he will not cooperate with me so I start to get short with him)\n\nMe: It seems like your very knowledgeable so why don't you explain to me what is exactly wrong and how we should fix it.\n\n(Stays quiet for a few seconds and its obvious he doesn't have an answer)\n\nNE: Well check your mac registration or possibly you aren't assigning a correct ip address. LOOK I don't have time to argue, get me to one of your engineers NOW.\n\nMe: I can't do that sir and I am the highest tech support you can reach today. Sir at this point I will need to schedule a technician and i can assure that its an issue with your wiring, again we are not getting signal to the modem.\n\nNe: FINE, I will go outside and check for you!\n\n(Before i can speak i hear him walking outside mumbling to himself angrily then a long silence....)\n\nMe: umm....sir are you still there?\n\n(no response)\n\nMe: sir?\n\nNe: It looks like someone crashed into the box you guys have in my front yard (his pedestal). I'm going to plug in this wire that came out.\n\nMe: Sure I'll keep an eye on my end to see if we have connection.\n\nNE: OF COURSE you will get signal as I JUST PLUGGED IT IN.\n\n(The way he said it as if he was right all along which irked me a bit)\n\nMe: Ok I got signal on my end now! You might notice some intermittent \nissues as your levels are slightly out of range but we will be getting someone out there.\n\nI schedule the appointment but don't get any acknowledgement that he was wrong in anyway. I understand people who work in IT or networking may be knowledgeable but you called me for my professional help. I guess some people can't manage their ego.  ",

How are you doing this morning?”\n\n“I’m alright, how can I help you?”\n\n“Is it morning there where you’re at right now? Is it morning?”\n\n“Yes it is, how can I help you?” /eyebrow raise/\n\n“I just wanted to talk. I’m not the policy holder, the policy holder is my guest here...down below. Do you know who this is? You know who this is? You said your name was Tiffany?”\n\n“No my name is Rachael. How can I help you with your insurance today?”\n\n“Oh it’s his insurance he asked me to call I’m a friend of his but I’m not his employer, I’m wanting him down here to work for me below the earth. Do you know the morning? I’m asking if you do you see the sun? I’m the angel of the sun, the brightest angel, or was the brightest angel, and that he asked me to call. He would like a life insurance policy. And I talked to him, y’know that you’re not going to live for more than 10 to 15 years y’know that don’t ya Ash? And I said well let me call your insurance policy, your company that handles your insurance policy and let me see if I can work something out. I do like to make deals with everyone, they sign my contracts and they join me down here to work for me. I’m the son of the angel of the morning, the son of Him, my Father, so I’m sorry Amanda, uhm uh um Amanda, I’m temp, uh this is not a joke, HE WANTS AN INSURANCE POLICY DO YOU UNDERSTAND? So let’s very polite and very proper.”\n\nI'm just confused and trying to process what is happening at this point and confusedly answer.\n\n“Ok, the life insurance department is not open on Sundays they are open Monday, uh if you would like I can provide the phone number but I do not work with life insurance.”\n\n*BUTTON MASHING*“Like I was told you can’t hear anything when someone is talking to me, they have to wait until they finish speaking and then you can hear. Do you understand it’s a noise reduction? I would like to contact with insurance, with the life insurance department please. The life insurance department please if they’re open could you hit me though to that extension please.”\n\nDuring this I'm on mute yelling at my manager to remote in that this guy is crazy.\n\n“They are not open on Sundays”\n\n“Oh no…you see there are a lot of restrictions on Sundays. I’m not allowed to walk the world on Sundays, but my children can hover so perhaps I’ll have one of them go to an insurance agency and get ash an insurance policy, life insurance policy because he has 15 years to live, and he wants to provide for his mother and father and nieces, because I’m trying to work a deal with him and he will be gone. He will be dead in 15 years alright? I can have him work for me. Well thank you very much. Can you contact me…please send me to an extension with your supervisor, I want to talk to him. Do you have a supervisor at your call center right now, dear?”\n\n“Yeah I do, but he does not handle life insurance policies either.”\n\n“That’s ok dear, just patch me through to your supervisor please.”\n\n“Ok, please hold.”",

Can I get your date of birth to pull up an account?\n \nRC: umm... *in the background I hear \"what's your date of birth?\"*\n\nMe: so.... Who ya talking to? \nRC: no one. My date of birth is 11/12/1956.\n\nMe: hmm... Are you sure this is YOUR date of birth? \n\nRC: yep! \n\nAt this point, I have all the patience in the world. So I thought I'd as a few more verification questions to see if maybe I misheard RCs whisperings. After every question was repeated and answered by someone else in the background, I decided to call RC out. \n\nMe: ok, Im going to be real here. If you're not the person that you say you are and you gain access to this account, it is a situation of fraud and we do take that very seriously here. So, I'll ask again: are you the person you are claiming to be. \n\nRc: well no... But she can't talk. She's mute. \n\nMe: oh, OK. Well I can't verify the account unless she's on the line. \n\nRC: But she can't taaaaaaalk. \n\nMe: I'm sorry, unless she's on the line, I can't secure anything. You can go to a local office if you would like though. \n\nRC: This is discrimination! \n\nMe: I'm sorry you feel that way. \n\nRC then makes an animalistic sound and disappears. \n\nMP: Hello, this is actually Janet Doe. \n\nMe: oh hello!

April Fool's Day.  \nSo, as usual, this story comes from my time working automated disc rental. For a twist though, it's from my chat support days.  \nSo... This particular client was really bad about briefing us on upcoming events and promotions. We *might* find out a few hours before it went live, and only if our team leads knew (which was a toss-up in itself).  \nWe had no idea they were going to pull a stunt. It was an obvious stunt, but then, we'd all be out of a job if customers picked up on obvious things, right?  \nSo this year, the website was plastered with advertisements about how the kiosks were going to be stocked with sandwich materials as well as discs.  \nMeat, cheese, bread, condiments, the whole deal. Same 'rental' fee, just no late returns and such because you're going to eat the product (I hope).  \nSo it was obviously a joke. Very obviously not real. Disclaimers on the page for it and everything.  \nI still got one precious soul who decided to create a support request for it though.  \nThis snowflake was offended because he went out to the machine hoping to get some of our new product and there wasn't any in three different locations.  \nI told him (while laughing my backside off with my cubemate) that it was a joke, not real, April Fool's joke, etc.  \nHe wasn't buying it. Demanded a supervisor because it's false advertising, he was disappointed, and I wasn't bothering to help and make it right.  \nUnfortunately, we didn't have a chat-trained supervisor yet (we were the pilot team), so we did the whole front-line agent saying \"I'll be your supervisor this time\" deal. Unfortunately again, I got a real people-pleaser.  \nHe ended up getting a few free movies out of his stupidity, but oh well, I guess.   \nMoral, please use your brain.

Due to the expected increase in phone calls, I was asked to come and help out for the day.\n\nAs the day went on and the weather got progressively worse, we got more and more flooding calls coming in, people requesting sand bags, saying that roads are flooded due to drains being blocked, etc etc. Most of these were pretty standard, and most folks were doing their best to stay high and dry and out of the horrendous weather.\n\nThen I get this call from this one absolute winner:\n\nME: Welcome to ######, You're speaking with DarkLord84\n\nCaller: Yes, I would like to enquire about tenting at *insert name of camping ground managed by the government department I work for here*.\n\nMe: Uh, yes sir, it will cost you this much per night to stay here, but you need to be aware that we have a major weather event on its way, there is a cyclone that is approaching this area.\n\nCaller: Oh ok.

The civil defense is giving out constant updates to the public through both radio and their website about whether or not people need to evacuate and several areas have been hit with evacuation notices. Not to mention I had to walk back to my car after I finished my shift and just about got blown down the road - it's literally raining sideways out there. \n\nI've heard reports of barbecues being picked up off the ground and being blown through the walls of houses. And yet this guy is absolutely determined to go camping regardless of the weather and couldn't give a damn that there is a possibility his campsite may be in the path of a freaking cyclone! Just completely dismisses my warning even though he could be putting himself in serious danger!!\n\nLater I found out that the campsite had been closed for safety reasons and that there were people at the gate complaining that they couldn't get in. I'm guessing this brave lad was one of them.\n\nIt just goes to show that common sense in dangerous situations is not always that common, and that you can never have a day working in a busy call center without at least one absolutely ridiculous caller!",

        "text": "My first job out of college was doing phone surveys.  We did an assortment of them from food products to political surveys.  \n\nI love doing the political surveys because you actually learned a lot.  Now we had quotas on how many surveys we had to complete an hour.  So I do not care what you tell me or how you feel as long as you answer the questions.  For phone surveys male quotas are much harder to reach since the females usually answer first and often get insulted if you ask for the male.  \n\nSo I am calling a heavily red(conservative) state and get a  male that answers, and  this guy is very interested in doing my poll too.  So he is very informed and very Republican.  Well shortly in I hear someone in the background yelling at him and I think I am going to lose my call.  He politely asks me to hold for a second, and he tells the person that they were too lazy to answer the phone so he gets to do the survey.  Then the other voice gets closer and becomes more clearer.  This female starts screaming at him that his opinions do not fully represent their household and he needs to represent his wives opinions.  They begin discussing something i can not hear, and he comes back and asks \"Can you call back after we are done and survey my wife?\"  I tell him I am sorry we can only do one survey per phone number.  He tell me \"ok\", and then I hear a mad scuffle  with banging and stomping and finally a door slams and in an exhausted voice he tells me to continue.  For the rest of the survey I hear the wife pounding on what I assume is the bathroom door he locked himself demanding he let her in as he calmly and happily finished my call.  ",

This is where the bank will mail or electronically transfer your funds to various people you want to pay.\n\nWell there are bill pay services independent of a bank people can and do pay for.  This call is regarding one them.   \n\nThe call starts off with the customer alerting me is very upset, but still very rational.  So I am thinking maybe bill messed up, and I how can I help him.  So after verifying and I ask him his problem he says \n\nUpset customer(UC) The payments came out of my account! \n\nMe: And did the payees(the recipient of the payments) not receive their payments?\n\nUC: No of course they got them, but the money came out of MY account.\n\nMe:  Ok, did it come out early or cause overdrafts?\n\nUC:  No, ofcourse not I am not poor.\n\nMe:  You only have one payment account.  Did you mean to add another account to make your payments from?\n\nUC:  Why did it not tell me I had to add another account?\n\nMe: Well I can help you add another bank account to pay from sir\n.\n\nUC: Then tell me how to do that.\n\n(after instructing him to navigate through our web page to get to the right area and his is filling the bank and routing number)\n\nUC:  What is your account and routing number.\n\nMe: Sir, you would need to put one of your accounts in there to add.\n\nUC: I pay you 10 dollars a month and you pay my bills.\n\nMe:(now i understand, he think we cover his payments if he pays us ten dollars a month).  Sir, we just send the money from your bank account to your payees you set up.\n\nUCP:  That is the stupidest fucking thing I ever heard of.  Who would pay for that.  Stamps cost a lot less than 10 dollars a month.\n\nAfter that we go back and forth on the benefits of bill pay and how it does help some people.  The call ended up with me creating multiple incidents asking for us to refund all of his payments and his 10 service fee, that he did not pay because the first month is free, but yet he demanded to be refunded for it.  This guy also sent 500 dollar payments to what I would assume are his family members thinking we would cover that too.\n\n\n\n\n",

I worked outsource Customer Care for a US cellular carrier, let's call them \"Pink\". We handled customer care for customer's whose credit rating was \"less than stellar\". A revolutionary new program was in play for these customers, being a mix of a monthly plan, a discounted phone on a contract (with cancellation fees for breaking said contract), prepayment required for your monthly plan, and any overage paid for by a prepaid credit balance. Confusing? To most of our customers, yes. Now, of course, it's known as a standard prepaid monthly plan, but with no contract or free phone (at least in Canada).\n40-50% of our calls in Care were along the lines of \"I'm out of minutes, and I need to make a call, but I have no money. Pleeeeeease!!!\" Our answer, of course, was \"No.\" Having said that, there were specific situations where we could hit the \"Restore\" button, all for family emergency type situations, until the next End of Day process, when the account would resuspend. Very specific reasons, all laid out in a nice intranet article. One exception per month. I think we can all see where this is going.\n\n\nOur cast: \n\n$Me - your humble servant\n\n$U - our plucky caller\n\n$CT - fellow call centre wage slave with a wonderfully dark sense of humour\n\n\n&gt;$U: Hi! I need my phone cut on 'cause &lt;insert family emergency lifted from \"Restoral\" article&gt;\n\n&gt;$Me: Oh, I'm sorry to hear &lt;family member's condition&gt; Let me see what I can do to help.\n\n\n&lt;Insert standard cellular account verification procedure. You know the one. Sigh.&gt;\n\n\n&gt;$Me: OK, so your account is showing as suspended for insufficient pre-payment. Let me see if we can get you up and running due to your situation.\n\n\nI check the history. This month alone, $U has been restored 14 days in a row. For poops and chuckles, I check previous months. $U hasn't made a payment in over 2 months.\n\n\n&gt;$Me: I'm sorry, but the option to restore is only available once a month, and your account was restored yesterday due to compassionate reasons.\n\n&gt;$U: That's a lie! You can cut me back on at any time!\n\n&gt;$Me: Yes ma'am, we can. But we need a payment to keep your service on.\n\n&gt;$U: I can't make a payment right now! I need my phone!\n\n&gt;$Me: I'm sorry. I cannot restore your service.\n\n&gt;$U: Fine! I'll call back until I get someone who will!\n\n&gt;$Me: Sorry I couldn't help, but thanks for calling &lt;Pink&gt; today, and have a nice day! (Why yes, I am Canadian. Why do you ask?)\n\n\n&lt;click&gt;\n&lt;5 or more minutes of available time&gt;\n\n\n&gt;$Me: Hey, $CT, you won't believe the call I just had! This customer has had 40 manual restorals in the last 2 months!\n\n&gt;$CT: Dude! (Not really, but I'm trying to keep this post SFW)\n\n&gt;$CT: Gimme the number!\n\n\n&lt;outbound call AUX code toggled&gt;\n\n\n&gt;$CT: Hello $U. This is $CT, one of the managers here at &lt;Pink&gt; (LIE!) I'm calling regarding a breach of service on your account. We have multiple recorded requests for account restoral with no payment made to maintain your service. We have flagged your account for regular review, and any further breaches will result in termination of service, including full cancellation fees applied to the final bill.\n\n&gt;$U: ........... (I couldn't hear this bit)\n\n&gt;$CT: Thank you for your understanding. Yes. Payment of $XX will enable your remaining plan, and any smaller payment will allow you to make pay per use calls until that amount is gone.\n\n&gt;$U: ........... (Again, no idea)\n\n&gt;$CT: You can absolutely use the Prepaid cards to make that payment. Thank you very much, and have nice day. &lt;$CT hangs up&gt;\n\n\n40 agent feedbacks later, $CT and $Me go for a well earned break.\n\n\nTL;DR: Customer whines for service; agents just hit \"restore\".",

He starts complaining about how long he's been on the phone and says he normally charges $60 an hour for his services and he sent us a bill for the time he's spent on the phone. I've had several people tell me how much they charge hourly and how much of their time we've wasted, so I shrugged it off thinking he was joking.

        "text": "I work for a bank, and had a customer that while she was clearly not stupid, she was clearly looking for someone to blame for a problem that simply wasn't ours. \n\nWhat had happened is that she'd signed jointly on an insurance policy, and the other party on it had been in dispute and had since absconded, and the insurance company simply billed her for it and took it out of her account. Was just over £2000 back in December. For reference though she had like £40,000 in the account, so this wasn't going to ruin her.\n\nShe was furious this happened at the time and that we couldn't stop them taking it (we did something called a temporary reversal because it was an outstanding transaction at the time, and this makes the funds available to you again but purely on the basis that if the company claims it, they will take it, it's part of the debit card guarantee and the entire reason people are allowed to use debit cards). \n\nLater she logged this as a dispute with us so we could log a chargeback with VISA for her, and we also temporarily credited the account pending the outcome of the case. As expected, the company provided evidence that they were entitled to the payment, so we sent a letter to the customer stating that she had 2 weeks to provide us with contrary evidence or we'd be removing the temporary credit from her account. \n\nIt was upon receipt of this letter we sent to her that she called up. We sent it over a week ago but she'd been away so only read it today. Which is totally our fault. She wanted to log a complaint and wanted us to guarantee that we wouldn't take the payment back from her. Conversation went something like this. \n\nMe - I'll gladly log the complaint for you, but the only way to ensure we don't take back the credit is to supply us with the evidence by the designated date, there isn't anyone who can change that \n\nCust - There has to be someone who can do this, you are not taking this money out of my account again. I am furious that you allowed the money to go out of my account in the first place. This is fraud.\n\nM - By our definitions, we regard fraud as when a person or company uses your details when having never been given those details by yourself. As you gave them your details, even though it was for a deposit and the other party was meant to be paying, that will be why they took the payment. And as we'd seen a genuine deposit payment to them prior to this, we would have no reason to assume this is also not genuine. As for the funds leaving the account I can only recommend getting the paperwork back to us as soon as possible, if you take it into branch they'll send it with their internal mail. \n\nC - But I never gave them permission to take the payment. And I don't have time to get the forms back before the cut off date. What happens if they're late? You're not taking the money back out, it's not my fault I didn't get the forms till today, you have to extend the time!\n\nM - Well they've supplied proof that they have the right to take the payment. If the forms aren't received in time the credit will be taken out, though we will still process the dispute even if the forms are late back, but minus the credit in your account. If that happens, if the dispute is in your favour you'll obviously receive the funds back into your account after that. \n\nC - I'm not at all happy with the way this is being dealt with, I don't think you fully understand the situation.\n\n\nI then logged the complaint for her, which I know got rejected by us (As I was helping out off the phones during the day and part of that was helping deal with escalated complaints) and she'll get a letter to take to our ombudsman. Now if there's a bank error, I'll gladly do what I can to fix it for a customer, I'm even guilty of being overly generous in terms of redress for customers if I think they've been wronged. But I don't think it takes a genius to realise that if you sign a joint insurance policy, if the company can't get payment from one of you, they'll take it from the other one. You're jointly named and they have your card details from when you supplied your deposit. Just because you made a fuckup involving money doesn't make it our fault, nor does disagreeing with you mean I don't understand.\n\nTL:DR -  Customer doesn't understand what joint means, assumes it's someone elses mistake.

M=Me | C=Caller\n_______________________________________________\nM: *opening speal/greeting* May I have your first and last name please?\n\nC: *gives generic first name and highly unique last name*\n\nM: Excellent, thank you. How may I assist you today?\n\nC: My husband is retiring from &lt;company&gt; and we want to know how much they are contributing for his coverage.\n\nM: Okay ma'am, let me see if I can find a profile and if we can confirm that *inputs name into system and only one result pops up*\n*looks at result with date of birth January 01, 0001*\n\nM: Ma'am, would you spell your last name out for me? I want to make sure I can find the right profile to answer your question.\n\nC: Sure. *spells out name that perfectly matches what I just put in*\n\n*I double take*\n\nM: Hmm... okay, I don't think we have a proper profile for you yet, because according to this you're over two thousand years old (at this I heard my coworker laugh next to me, caller did not sound even close to 5% of that). Let me look at some of the generic info I have from &lt;company&gt; and see if there's anything I can speak on....\n_______________________________________________\nI then proceed to explain that until we receive the info from the company, we can't confirm what they're each eligible for. Because of some circumstances she mentioned for her husband, I explained there's a chance we'll have to submit a ticket to confirm with the company that whatever amount they tell us is correct according to his situation.\n\nShe has no issue with this, and is thankful I answered as completely as I could based off the available information.\n\nI end the call then turn to my coworker: I know I didn't fully secure the call (there were additional security questions I'm supposed to ask before giving out personal info such as age), but I'm pretty sure revealing that our system said she was over 2,000 years old wasn't a HIPAA violation.",

        "text": "Hey phone-jockeys. I've got a few more good stories from my time working customer support for one of the majour automated DVD rental systems.  \n  \n***\n    \nThis one was a slow night.   \nA lady calls in about a decently-sized charge on her card and wants information about it.   \nPretty routine stuff. Those ones you probably get an entire bucket of every single night.  \nShe explains that she couldn't return a disc due to having gone into labour. We hear this at least once a day.  \nWhen I pull up her account, I see a few transactions marked with the same problem type I would use, so of course I need to check them.  \nTwo weeks prior, she was in labour and couldn't return a disc.  \nThe week before that, she was having a baby and couldn't return a disc.  \nTwo weeks prior to that one, another child.  \nNow... Unless I'm mistaken, humans are just unable to procreate faster than thirsty rabbits.  \nSo I decide to basically be obnoxious about not giving her a refund. I wasn't doing it anyway, but I was baiting her for those magical words.  \n  \n&gt;RabbitLady: I'd like to speak to your supervisor.  \n&gt;Kieri: Not a problem. Can I put you on a short hold to see if she's available?  \n  \nSo I run around and find this one magical creature. She didn't take ANY crap off of ANYBODY.  \nI pass the call off and keep the transaction open. I enjoyed peeking back at the supervisors' notes after passing a call off.  \nThe supervisor had plastered big, bold, red text across all of her transactions stating that the customer is under review by the Loss Prevention team and she is not to be given any refund under any circumstance.  \nTake that, RabbitLady.  \n  \n***\n    \nThis one was the true definition of irony.  \nEarly early morning, not really awake yet because opening shift.  \nBackground: We were the only not-overseas centre that supported this client.  \nI get a call from an older lady.  After I give my opening statement, her first words were\n   \n &gt; AmericanLady: Oh, thank the lord, I got an American. I want to speak to your supervisor.  \n  \nWe weren't able to just ditch a call cold like that, so I needed to ask her why she wanted to speak with a supervisor. They got a little miffed if you went to them with just  \n  \n &gt; Kieri: Hey, so I've got a lady who wants to talk to you. No, I don't know why.  \n  \nShe goes on this long, drawn-out explanation of how she was on call with an agent from the other site and didn't get good service.  \nMade sure to emphasize how horrible it is that they're taking away good, American jobs and shipping them overseas. Taking the food out of her babies' mouths.  \nOh yeah. Side note: we're not an American site either. We're technically outsourced labour too. She's about to complain about outsourced labour TO outsourced labour.  \nSo I head off to my supervisor with this and he just puts his head in his hands and sits for a few seconds, then gives me his facepalm-muffled extension to send her through.  \n  \n***\n    \nDiscs that don't play properly. You'll get so many of these that they just become automatic.  \nIt was to the point that I had entire conversations in macro-format when I worked the chat line (copied from actually typed conversations so the logs looked legitimate, of course).  \nWhen we say we've seen it all, we really have seen it all.  \nEverything from \"accidentally\" running them over with their car to \"I found it in my baby's playpen.\"  \nThe one that takes the cake though, was this little gem. I really wish I was creative enough to make this up.\n    \n &gt; Kieri: Thank you for calling &lt;RentalCompany&gt;, my name is Kieri. How can I help you today?  \n &gt; DiscRepairman: I rented one of your discs and it's not working.  \n\n &lt;skip opening account&gt;  \n\n &gt; Kieri: I'll need to ask you a few questions about the disc so that it will be marked off properly. Did you notice any scratches to the playing surface of the disc?  \n &gt; DiscRepairman: Yeah, there was a big ol' scratch on it, but we found a YouTube video about how to fix them, so we followed the video and it made it worse.  \n &gt; Kieri: Could I ask what you did to try to fix it?  \n &gt; DiscRepairman: Yeah, the video said we could put it in the microwave for a little bit and it would fix the scratches, now my microwave is all frazzled and the disc is worse. It smells like porkchop now too.  \n  \nI mean... They can't be that stupid, right? Right?!  \nApparently I was wrong and my faith in humanity needed to drop just a hair lower.",

He talked about music, he'd reminisce about the old days, and then he'd spend a solid hour talking about his wife. Never a negative thing to say about her, either. The guy just really missed his wife and knew he would drive his friends crazy talking about her, so he'd call one of *those* phone lines to do it instead.

At this point I start to offer account management options which were lackluster and never included refund. \n\nCx: no, no. You WILL refund this or I will file a lawsuit. \n\nMe: again ma'am/sir I can only cancel your account. Would you like to go ahead and do that? \n\nCx: did you not hear me?

        "text": "For context my company provides fraud monitoring services for other financial institutions(FIs).  We look at the activity on the card and contact the cardholder on the FIs behalf.  I mostly took inbound calls in regards to this.  The customers name is very common so I hope that it's usage will not bother someone.  As the pronunciation of it further expands on the intelligence of those involved.\n\nSo I get this call and immediately red flags are popping on the caller.  So we have Me, Obvious Fruadster(OF), and Stupid Bank Rep(SBR, we will be coming in shortly).\n\n\nME:  Hello this is Finlanderboy with card services can I have you name please?\n\nOF:(in strong middle eastern accent)  My card number is XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX, it is blocked unblock it\n\nMe: (Definitely fraud pulls up the account right away, Jacob Smith from a Midwest state int he US, tons of 5000 dollar max transaction amount purchases swiped in Dubai at jewelry stores) I still need your name sir.\n\nOF: Hac-up Smyff, I need you to unblock my card now.\n\nMe:(still have to do security verifiaction)  For security purposes can I get the last four of your Social Security Number.\n\nOF: I gave you the card number just unblock it.\n\nMe: Well we require you to verify security questions before we can continue.  Can I verify the last four of your Social Security Number?\n\nOF: 1234(yes he actually gave this)\n\nMe: Sorry, that does not match.   You have one more attempt, \n or you would need to contact your financial institution for further assistance.\n\nOF:(Quickly) Thank you bye.\n\n\n\nNow I start noting his account for obvious fraudster call in, and field a few more calls when I get a call on FI line.  This is where banks call in on behalf of customers.  \n\n\nME:  Hello this is Finlanderboy with card services can I have your name please?\n\nSBR: Hello this is Stupid Banker Rep code of the day is XXX(this is a code for us to know it is a banker, this must be kept secret and should not be given out if a customer is on the line as they can then use that to pretend to work for the FI and unblock cards they stole.) I am calling on card number XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX and I have the customer on the phone with me. Say hello jacob.  This is for Jacob smith.\n\nOF:Hello\n\nME: Well since I have the customer on the line I would need to verify them for security purposes as well.  Sir can I have your name.\n\nOF: Jay-cup Smyff(First name sounded better last name still off)\n\nME:And for security purposes can I verify the last four of your Social Security Number.\n\nOF: I do not have that, I need my card unblocked.  I am travelling.  \n\nSBR: Let me get that for you Mr. Smith.  Your Social security number is xxx-xx....\n\nME: ( i interrupt him realizing how stupid this bank rep is, i would fail the call monitoring for doing this call but this bank rep is too stupid) SBR the customer needs to verify, and please do not use the whole Social Security number.\n\nSBR: Well let me just give that then.\n\nMe: No! that is a security breach and I would need to terminate the call if you try to verify for him.(Making stuff up, not sure what the protocol was)\n\nSBR:  Well Mr. Smith does not have his last four of his Social Security Number.\n\nMe:  Then how do you know it is really him?\n\nOF: It is me, trust me.\n\nSBR: How would he have the customers card number if he was not the customer?\n\nMe: (too baffled by obvious idiocy to give an answer)\n\nSBR: So his last four are XXXX.\n\nMe: I am sorry but since the customer could not verify I am unable to help with this.\n\nSBR: We verified his Social Security Number and the code of the day, please unblock his card.\n\nMe: I am sorry sir, but our protocol is to verify with the cardholder if they are unable to we can not help.  If you would like I can get a supervisor, but I can not take action on this card.\n\nSBR: I will just unblock it on my end good bye.\n\n\n\nSo I immediately contact my team lead and let them know what happened and why.  They reviewed the call, and reblocked the card, and they would reach out to the bank manager.  But wait it is not over.  The dialer program we have will try to route a call back to the original person. So I got this call...\n\n\n\nME:  Hello this is Finlanderboy with card services can I have you name please?\n\nSBR:(not aware it is me) hello, the code of the day is XXX.  I want to unblock card XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX. For Jacob Smith\n\nMe:Sir this account is confirmed fraud by the cardholder(by this time the real Jacob smith called in to confirm it was fraud)\n\nSBR:(surprised) But I have him on the other line?\n\nMe: Yeah apparently someone called in pretending to be him to unblock the card.  So our outbound team called him at XXX-XXX-XXXX and he confirmed the activity was not his.  He did not leave the country.\n\nSBR:  Ohh, well I called to complain about the previous agent I spoke to here.  He was rude and would not block the card for me when I had the customer on the line.  I would like to file a complaint about him.\n\nMe: Sure SBR.  Let me get one of my supervisors.  All are calls are recorded so if someone tried to cheat a customer we can find that out right away\n\nSBR: (Hangs up)\n\n\n\nThis bank rep compromised our call line by giving a fraudster our code of the day, and then gave customers private information.  He could do serious harm to his institution's customers because he is so stupid.  I am not upset he lied to get himself out of trouble, that is common.  I am upset this guy had/has a job where he can and will hurt people.",

I call about this one guys card and he puts me on speaker phone with his wife as we review the charges.  I forgot the exact name the merchant used for themselves but it was for 9.95 and the couple were unsure of it.  So I googled the merchant and it turns out it is a discreet name for a  pornography subscription.  The wife mortified said it was definitely fraud. So I start reading my closing script when they confirm fraud and I ask \"Do you have the card in your possession?\"  The guy says it is in the car and asks his wife to go get it.  Then the guy gives a hushed voice and tells me the transaction was his, and not fraud.  So I left him to it.  I was always curious how that relationship turned out.\n",

        "text": "I work for for customer service for a prepaid debit card. This one cardholder (CH) called in who was steaming mad throughout the entire time. He called earlier that day to dispute a transaction. The process for disputes is that the card is marked stolen which will inactive the card and then tier 2 will handle the dispute. After 10 business days of filing the dispute and sending the dispute forms to the dispute department within that timeframe, the cardholder is eligible for provisional credit. When the tier 2 agent he spoke to explained this he asked for a supervisor and when the supervisor said the same thing he hung up and now he's calling back because the card is inactive and he's pissed that the card isn't working. So here's how it went down\n\n&gt;Me: *After giving greeting* Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with?\n\n&gt;CH: [Name] and believe me you will not have the pleasure of speaking with me because I'm mad as hell.\n\n&gt;Me: *After verifying the birth date, ZIP code, and phone number* How may I help you today?\n\n&gt;CH: *Explaining the situation I outlined earlier* I withdrew my dispute because I didn't want you to inactivate my card.\n\nI would like to clarify that neither the first agent, the tier 2 agent, nor the supervisor he spoke to noted anything about withdrawing his dispute.\n\n&gt;CH: So I want you to activate my card and then I want you to give me the money for the unauthorized charge now! Not in 10 business days, Right now!\n\n&gt;Me: *Explain to him once again the dispute process to him and that we can't reactivate his card unless he withdraws his dispute which means that we will consider the charge authorized and if any further fraudulent activity occurs on the card as a result of reactivating the card we will not be responsible.*\n\n&gt;CH: Get me to a supervisor and don't connect me with [previous supervisor he spoke with] because she has no idea what she's talking about.\n\nSo after 20 minutes of waiting for someone to be available, I transferred him and he stayed on the phone with a supervisor for another 30 because he didn't want to believe the supervisor that I transferred her to and wanted to speak to her superior. I don't know if he ever got to speak to someone else, but I'm going to assume that he didn't. So he spoke with five people who all told him the same thing, almost spoke to a sixth person who would've told him the same thing, because he didn't want to accept the fact that it takes 10 days to get his money back. At that point, just do what we say since having a freakout will do nothing to get your money back.",

The company gets a contract from the passport office to answer passport application enquiries.  The primary reason this has been farmed out is because there's pretty much only one answer callers ever get: \"Your application is being reviewed and we will contact you once this review is complete\"--basically it's a service to let you confirm the application has been received, and while it's also technically the \"complaints\" line, the purpose of the complaints line is to basically let you vent into the void which answers \"Sorry to hear that. No exceptions. Ever\".  If there's one organisation in all the world that could not give less of a shit about your opinion on timescales, I think the passport office would be it.  \n\nSo my friend is speaking to a lady who is furious, furious that her application has not been processed yet.  She's going on holiday two weeks from the date of application, and has applied for a passport without paying for the rush service (meaning the passport could take up to three weeks to arrive).  He tries to explain that literally nothing can be done, the passport office will take as long as it takes.  Since the customer is steadily becoming more irate, my friend tries to end the call.  Uniquely for a call centre (at least in my experience), advisors are instructed to refuse requests to escalate to a manager So:\n\n&gt;Friend: Even if you aren't satisfied with my answers, I can't change the situation.  Your complaint has been noted. I think we should send the call here.\n&gt;\n&gt;Lady: No!  That's not good enough, I want to speak to your manager!\n&gt;\n&gt;F: I can't put you through to anyone else.  There's nobody I could transfer you to.\n&gt;\n&gt;L: [screaming] DO IT!\n\nThey go round in circles for a little while on this. Lady yells so much she tires herself out.  Eventually:\n\n&gt;L: Well, if you're not going to put me through to your manager, I will be writing to the head of your organisation to complain about the terrible service I have received!\n&gt;\n&gt;F: That's fine. Sure.\n&gt;\n&gt;L: Give me the name and address!\n&gt;\n&gt;F: Let me just pull up her address on my computer...OK, have you got a pen?\n&gt;\n&gt;L: Yes!\n&gt;\n&gt;F: OK. Ready?

I had worked up the entire quote when she then tells me that the unit she is quoting is actually kept in another state. *facepalm* Cue frustration over having to completely redo everything I'd just spent half an hour doing. Now this would have taken less time had she actually sent over an application. Instead she sent me a bunch of irrelevant forms that forced me to ask for the missing info I needed.\n\nOver the last 3 days, I've been talking to her trying to get her to answer my questions. I sent an email to her with about 4 questions I needed answered...she emailed me back answering 1. This has gone on for 3 days. \n\nToday, I finally got everything I needed and sent her an email with the quote/application that the client needs to sign and return if  they want the coverage.\n\nMy words VERBATIM: We need the attached application fully completed and signed by the client if they wish to proceed with coverage. Please let me know if you have any questions!\n\nHER RESPONSE: Looks great.

Bit**es dog dies of parvo and HR calls me in saying they received a request from our client to take me off the phone due to a complaint escalated by the clinic.\n\nSummary of complaint:\n\nHe prevented me from getting that vaccines that would have saved my dog by intentionally booking the weekend doctors when he knew that was the only time I can go to the vet.\n\nMy response:\n\nMy job is to book appointments for people who agree to it.\nShe told me to f**k off so I did.\nThere are three hospitals in town where you can just walk-in without an appointment. Don't remember telling those not to let her in.\n\n\nTLDR - B***h is blaming for her dog dying of parvo since I booked the weekends for other people after she refused to book it with me.\n\n\n ",

        "text": "LTL FTP and sorry about the formatting and length!!\n\n\nI work for 'Insurance Call Centre' which closes at 8PM Monday-Friday. Yesterday a call comes through at 7:58PM and I'm like ok, get this done with ASAP and be on my way home for dinner, a hot bath and an early night. \n\nHA! Nope.\n\nThe first words I hear are 'I want to speak to your supervisor, I don't deal with anyone except Supervisor A or Supervisor B.'\nWell neither of them were working that evening.\n\n\nME: I'm sorry Mr Customer, A and B aren't in the office this late as we close at 8PM.\n\nC: But I need it for tomorrow and I will only speak to A or B.\n\nME: They will be back in the office tomorrow if you want to call back then?\n\nC: NO !! I need it very early and they give me discounts, I am a business man, you know.\n\nME: *(Internally) A lack of planning on your part does not constitute an emergency on your part.* \n\nWell I'm sure I can help and I can still apply discount for you.\n\n\nCustomer then proceeds to spend the next 30 minutes changing the subject or talking about completely irrelevant stuff, making the shift manager and I 40 minutes late in locking up and getting out of the office. \n\nI missed not only the bus I was supposed to be catching home, but also the later bus and didn't get home until after 9PM. So much for a long bath or an early night.\n\nI'm surprised I've lasted 4+ years in call centres *eyeroll*",

And they know what they want.\n\n\nI love when a flight is first cancelled b/c that's the best, because there are lots of open seats and you have the ability to make the best of a situation quickly. Well this lady calls in and complains that her flight at noon was cancelled and she wants a flight at 1 in first class...sorry we don't comp 7 thousand dollar seats due to weather, you can have this flight at 1pm in coach, and there's only 6 seats left.\n\n\nIn the 38 second rant that she made, the airport and possibly others calling on the phone managed to take the last seats. So of course she's livid \n\n&gt; YOUVE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME? THEY CANT BE GONE THAT FAST\n\n\"I do have seats on a flight at 3pm, however..\"\n\n&gt; WHAT? NO NO NO NO NO\n\n\"'Ma'am I do have seats in a flight at 3pm however we can't deliberate on this for too long because...\"\n\n&gt; WHAT HAPPENED TO THE FLIGHT AT 1? I NEED FIRST CLASS ON THE FLIGHT AT 3 THIS IS TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE\n\n(the weather is totally \"unacceptable\")\n\n*seats at 3pm are fully booked*\n\n\"Ma'am I'm afraid that your options are dwindling the last flight is at 5pm today many of your fellow passengers are having their flight irregularities resolved. I don't have any first class seats to offer, however I have a flight at 5pm. Our last flight of the day...lots of seats\"\n\n&gt; THEYRE SELLING OUT BEFORE I CAN DECIDE. \n\n\"let's get you on this flight at 5, if something opens up then the airport can switch you to something earlier please give me a moment while I work on this for you\"\n\n(3 minutes later)\n\n\"Ok. I have you booked and confirmed for the flight at 5 pm. You're going to want to head to your next gate your flight is departing in a few hours.\"\n\n&gt; WHAT ABOUT MY FRIEND? I CANT LEAVE HER BEHIND??????!!!\n\n\n**she neglects to inform me that she's traveling with someone else who's on a separate ticket. Loooool. No more seats on the flight at 5**\n\n\"Ma'am there's no more seats on the flight at 5pm\n\n&gt; THIS IS CRIMINAL!!! I CANT BELIEVE THIS AHWYEUEUJEOSNJSJKSIAJSIEIB\n(She literally said something I couldn't understand in no known language)\n\n&gt; GET US ON A FLIGHT TOGETHER. THERE HAS TO BE SOMETHING.\n\n\"I have nothing with two seats until tomorrow if you're looking to travel together\"\n\n&gt; NO. YOU ARE GOING TO MAKE THIS RIGHT\n\n\"??????\"\n\n&gt; HELLO?! YOU ARE GOING TO MAKE THIS RIGHT WE ARE NOT SITTING IN THE AIRPORT ALL DAY YOURE GIVING ME A HOTEL OR SOMETHING.\n\n\n\nOf course you are lady. You're going to sit in the airport all day until 5 because at this rate I'm sure all the hotels were booked in the process of your near-sightedness even if there was something. She ended up hanging up. Found the friends ticket,  the airport put her friend on the flight at 1...friend actually took the flight and left her ass there until 5. \n\n\nNo petty revenge needed.",

The customer was calling about his account and couldn't take the money out without entering his confidential PIN into the phone.  The rep was awesome with offering to resend it, telling the customer it could be done through the phone at any time without a rep, or online and offering to walk him through that process.  \n\nBut the customer was STUCK on his idea of customer service.  When the rep went over how this was about security to protect his money and that didn't matter either.  The next excuse was that he had his 4 month years old - I kid you not, this is how he said it - and only had one hand and always had this baby so he just had no other way to make this transaction.  In order to provide good customer service we would have to change all provisions on the account because the baby cannot ever be put down and this guy cannot do anything with 1 hand.  ",

I think this lady gave me emotional whiplash.\n\nAmong many other things, my center takes calls for the city's public works and infrastructure services. Being spring and having a significant rainfall yesterday, we were pretty busy with high water/flooding calls.\n\nI had the *sweetest* old lady call in (she told me she's 85). I am in no way a morning person and she had me laughing and chatting like we were best friends and it wasn't even 9am. She was commiserating about how busy we must be right now and telling me she knew how crazy people could get in weather like this. \n\nShe had some pretty straight-forward requests and wanted to follow up on a request from a couple years ago that had fallen through the cracks. I sent everything through and told her that it should be taken care of. \n\nShe thanked me and asked my name. I told her my first name and added that anyone here could help her if she calls again. \n\n**Lady:** And your last name dear? I'm going to find out where you live because sometimes \"should\" doesn't always happen.\n\n**Me:** ...........................sorry? *(I was stunned, it's the best my brain could come up with)*\n\n**Lady:** \"Should\" doesn't always happen sweetheart, I want to know where you live so I can make sure things get done. \n\n**Me:** ...\n\n**Lady:** Bye now! I hope the phones stay fairly quiet for you today!\n\nI really hope it was just a bad joke but it definitely didn't sound like it.",
