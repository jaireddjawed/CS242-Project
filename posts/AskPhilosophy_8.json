        "text": " Ok so it's the imagination that produces schemata, but the unity of apperception is what unites each one's synthesis in a concept. The totality of concepts as constitutive of one overarching experience with synthetic unity is the understanding, the highest point of which is the unity of apperception. Judgment brings given representations to the unity of apperception which supplies the unity of an intuition by thinking a transcendental object = x, which assures coherence through the categories. So how should we describe the relationship between judgment and imagination? Both can be said to mediate between intuition and concept: imagination through its threefold synthesis and judgment through the category. But the category is the unity of the synthesis which is the function of the third moment of the threefold synthesis, the \"intellectual synthesis\" of recognition in a concept. So imagination and judgment apparently interpenetrate and describe the same thing, one from the side of sensibility and the other from the side of the unity of apperception. I'm not sure if that's what Kant is saying. This is the only way I've been able to make sense of it. Any advice on what I'm getting wrong?",

Keep in mind, my questions may be highly reductionist because of the material that is covered in class (Nozick's Anarchy, State and Utopia was summarized in 11 pages total.) This is done so to make way for other material. Anyways, although I do understand his shift from Voluntary Protective Associations (VPA) to Dominant Protective Associations (DPA,) I don't understand the highly reductionist concept of \"battle.\" Or that they must come into battle in order for there to be a DPA. It seems to me that the definition he gives for battle is only in regards to creating a DPA, and does not take into consideration other definitions of why there might be \"battles.\" Because of this, I tried to find a point in history where VPAs have come into battle to create a DPA but have failed to identify one. Therefore, is his concept of Anarchy, such as Rawls's, a purely imaginative one? Does he ever make a distinction between battle or war? Thanks in advance!",

I don't know if anyone has already came up with this.\n \nThe Belief System:\n\n- Believe it to be true that each time you go to sleep, you wake up as a completely different sentient being or animal at random. Every time you wake up, you're actually just waking up in this body after having slept in a different one previously, you just don't remember it because bodies have brains which can retain only their own body's information.\n- There is no end to living, you will constantly be living from one being to another, every being to ever have existed, you've lived through their life one day at a time (before they sleep/die, whichever comes earlier) and then to another, and you will go back to living through their life. \n\nWhat will this do?\n\nThis will enforce an awareness for actions which may harm others or any being. You'll know that each time you cause suffering to any being, you're the one who is going to suffer, sooner or later. This can be implemented regardless of religion. You wake up and you \"know\" you're a xyz-ian (insert any religion in place of xyz) because the brain remembers the past. You cannot just let go your believes, you have to follow the normal life while being aware that you will wake up in a different body when you sleep tonight, so better make the most of today and cause no harm to other beings while doing everything you have to do in this body, as it remembers.\n\nFeel free to add comment thoughts.",

In order for them to have an effectively free choice, they would have to be properly informed on all the options, educated in them - however, the only way to do this would be to extract them from their embeddedness in the Amish community, i.e., to effectively render them \"English.\" This also clearly demonstrates the limitations of the predominant liberal attitude towards the Muslim women wearing a veil: they can do it if it is their free choice and not an option imposed on them by their husbands or family. However, the moment women wear a choice as the result of their free individual choice (say, in order to realize their own spirituality), the meaning of wearing a veil changes completely: it is no longer a sign of their belonging to the Muslim community, but an expression of their idiosyncratic individuality; \"\n\nAre there any other works from other philosophers that focus particularly on this problematic, works where this is the main focus?",

        "text": "I’ve been playing with this idea for a while now and I believe that to some extent language has caused delusion in close to 100% of the human population.\n\nBefore I explain my point I have to say that I understand the importance of language and how it has positively affected our species.\n\nLet’s take it back to the beginning stages of humanity, before we began to think more deeply, and create more abstract concepts.\nOur languages were pretty basic. Noises to mimic sounds of the forest, to warn of danger, call out your location, things like that. It was a tool for survival, not a means of objectifying the world around us through science or making it subjective through imagination. Bad things happening wasn’t the result of “chaos” or “god” or “capitalism.” It just was. This is baseline reality in my opinion. Everything else is just a result of human interjections for better or worse.\n\nFast forward tens of thousands of years, we’ve become more complex in many ways; our understanding of nature, our languages, our civilizations. With the evolution of all of these things, our lives became easier, our conscious ability expanded with it. We began to look up at the stars and think about things beyond just our immediate survival. And we began to tell stories. Our imaginations pulled strings and weaved fantastical webs of beings that are beyond us that control the weather and other forces of nature. Things no longer “just were” they were meticulously done by some outside force. \n\nFrom here we only got further and further away from baseline reality. To the modern day where there are thousands of religions, philosophies, ideologies, none of them grounded in any sort of objective truth. All born of human imagination that has been perpetually distorted by our increasingly complex use of language. Concepts that most people use in day to day conversations, that are not to be found anywhere in reality outside of human thought. \n\nI’d like to write more on this but I’m a bit busy so I’ll have to cut it off here, tell me what you all think. Has language created mass delusion?",

        "author": "Nemo_Important",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/11chru6/are_people_generally_unhappy/",
        "text": "  People Are Generally Unhappy Within Our Current Society: An Observation\n\n*My experience is limited, but from what could be observed during the corona virus lockdown of 2020, people are clearly discontent with their lives.*\n\nHumans living in a first world, modern society are generally unhappy, or rather are only happy on the surface. Day to day, the majority toils and strives for goals not their own as means to financial ends. Though some do find fulfillment in undergoing such work due to the feeling of applying one’s efforts in a useful way; for most the labors are just that, labors. \n\nThis fact is difficult to be notice by many, for this has been the way of human existence for many generations; it’s all we know. Why does this obliviousness take place? I conjecture the multitude of distractions we are bombarded with on a daily, and constant basis is the proprietor for such ignorance. There will be a few who will perceive some of the injustices imposed on them, but a general sense of defeatism doesn’t allow those more “self-aware” individuals to pursue change. Instead, those people will indulge more self-destructively into their distractions, even become fanatical about them. Essentially, conforming for the sake of comfort and fleeting happiness. What’s easier; seeing the indignities imposed on oneself, deciding as an individual (or small group) to try and oppose the economic monster (or colloquially known as the economic model) through protest, petitions, etc., or resigning to the powers larger than the individual, seeking SOME catharsis in the small liberties at hand, and enjoying some chips and salsa as Netflix plays in the background?\n\nDuring the lockdown, an unknown fact was brought to light most didn’t know existed. The realization the population had that, at the drop of a hat, under the right circumstances, the federal government can force them to take certain actions against their will, which was a shocking revelation to the majority. Sure, the more rebellious types continued to do as they pleased, but they incurred the risks that comes with that expression of liberty if caught. Most just accepted the measures taken, begrudgingly so; a sense of disdain and uneasiness amongst the population with EACHOTHER being its consequence. We believe we are free until we are not, but the truth is freedom was never on the table. Freedom in first world, modern society is illusionary, a fairy tale to make the ones under rule feel better about their subjugation. \n\nThe foregoing is an excellent segue to the second issue, the effects of reduced distractions on the population. Boredom is a feeling everyone feels from time to time, and its almost laughable that we should ever experience such a feeling. Why? We have so many forms of entertainment at our literal fingertips at home that statistically there is SOMETHING to fill the void. Streaming services, social media, sports channels, YouTube, are just a few examples of ways one can entertain the mind. Of course, we also have forms of activities to entertain ourselves outside of the home: bars, clubs, restaurants, movies, bowling, skating, the list goes on. All these things can dissolve the feeling of boredom and people will pursue such activities to fill up their spare time. When one engages in such activity, reduction of stress, release of pent-up energies, and one may even experience joy and happiness. We are “free” to engage in these activities when we so please, and these activities are important to us for what they do for us. What happens when, suddenly, our entertainment is limited against our will? We face the reality, and most find that a hard pill to swallow.\n\nActs of rebellion are the obvious reaction in response to indignity, and the source of this rebellious behavior reinforces the idea that people don’t actually wish to be governed, but rather they wish to have structure provides stability and with that comes comfort. Political systems do offer structure, but at the cost of autonomy. Most people are blind to this trade because of all their distractions; take away the distractions, what’s left is a bunch of people who will start to realize how empty their lives are and their discontent bubbles to the surface. Most people will never come to this realization due to the fact they are unaware of what is taking place around them. Without our distractions, our lives become unfulfilling (people will actually begin to implore to go to work without their distractions, for both monetary needs and the need to do SOMETHING with their time.). When people are told they must stay home, that home is converted to a prison. The need for such a measure like isolation is due to the fact cities are becoming more and more densely populated. Apartments stack people one on top of the other, neighborhoods lined with houses with receding lawn sizes causing households to live closer and closer to one another. The only way to avoid people is to stay home; cities become petri dishes with the perfect environment for maladies to thrive. \n\nI will now address the swollen, money filled, piggy bank in the room; that is the people’s need for money. It’s a fact that money is needed for modern living in a first world society. One who has no money is considered impoverished and living in a destitute state. For the majority of people living in such a manner, it is not a choice, but a culmination of poor circumstances which unfolded in their lives. Unless one has a similar fortitude to Diogenes, one tends to avoid living in squalor conditions. Actually, it can be argued that living in such a way is frowned upon, and pity should be taken on individuals who live in such a way. I see those poor souls, lost and meandering the streets for scraps as the ultimate failure of humanity. The amount of food produced, allowed to spoil, and be tossed is laughably frustrating. But, if one doesn’t work for their bread, they do not eat. Charity, true charity, and kindness cannot exist if everyone is taught they must work to eat (by working to make money). Work being an unenjoyable means to an end for most, makes the accumulation of money a thing to covet. *I had to work for my money, so it is mine.*  Making money is also one of the few accomplishments one can achieve, and in turn, this fleeting and sparsely felt achievement (which for some comes only twice a month) makes us less likely to be charitable with our wealth. Keep in mind, there are people who truly wish they COULD be more charitable, but they must look out for them and theirs first, which doesn’t allow for one to be as charitable as they want to be. Without charity and kindness, humanity for each other cannot flourish. \n\nIf people continue to live as we do, and blindly traipse through life in an unaware stupor, human suffering will reoccur in an endless cycle. The future cannot be foretold, only speculated on. In my opinion, the end of that cycle will be realized when either a tipping point is reached and a general breakdown in society occurs, a disease occurs which humanity cannot control in time and severely reduces the population, or the systems in place to govern people become more efficient with their control and reduce humans to a more docile and agreeable creature. \n\nAfter thought- I am limiting my opinion based on my observations in America. My observations are limited to a small sample size, but I conjecture this could apply, to varying degrees, to other first world countries. \n\nI wish I could offer a solution, currently I am at a loss. Perhaps pondering the issue will draw a solution.",

In my own case, I become temporarily convinced by a metanarrative (e.g. call myself a “utilitarian”) not by rationally reflecting on the strengths of the view, but from a more aesthetic appreciation of the “vibe” of the view, which I then give up for another view when I have some other experience which prompts me to, say, Kantianism.

Both originate in  what is arguably the most influential work of philosophy ever written,  Aristotle’s *Categories*. In its first sense, “substance” refers to those things that are *object-like*, rather that *property-like*.  In its second sense, “substance” refers to the fundamental building blocks of reality.  Since the seventeenth century, a third use of “substance” has gained  currency. According to this third use, a substance is something that  underlies the properties of an ordinary object and that must be combined  with these properties for the object to exist. To avoid confusion,  philosophers often substitute the word “substratum” for “substance” when  it is used in this third sense. \n\nSo what do contemporary philosophers mean when they argue about theory of \"substance\" (substance theory, bundle theory)?\n\nIn a sentence \"a is F\", does \"substance\" refer to \"a\"?",

I am seeing a beautiful and calming sunset. Not a sunset. This can apply to anything, no? \n\nSo is he trying to say that subjective reality is true reality? Also, what happens when I see something for the first time? Say this was the first time I had ever glimpsed a sunset. I have never heard about it. No bias is shaping the sunset for me. Then what does the sunset mean for me? How has that meaning been found? Thank you !!",

Everyone by default are hedonistic in that for decisions that they make they’ll have a cost/benefit analysis(pro/con list) before they do x. That’s hedonism. So long as you have a modicum of practical wisdom and moderation(like destiny says) then you can avoid all the self destructive behaviors or engage with things in a healthy manor. if you don’t have practical wisdom and moderation while doing things that make you happy you end up destroying happiness rather than achieving it.

        "text": "Hi all, I have a question about Kant's ethics. So as the usual formulation goes, always act in such a way that you can also will that the maxim of your action should become a universal law. And as I understand it, a maxim largely consists of action and intention. So something like \"I should lie to protect the interests of others.\"\n\nSo I understand when we're looking at more general maxims like above, it's certainly not universalizable (and as I understand it, Kant argues that attempting to universalize that maxim leads to contradictions - all fine and good there). But my question is, how general/specific a maxim should we consider when we're attempting to formulate our principle? For example, take the typical example of the Nazi at the door. We might say that since \"I should lie to protect the interests of others\" is not a coherently universalizable maxim, we are obligated to not lie to the Nazi. But couldn't we formulate it more specifically? \"I should lie to protect the interests of the innocent from a murderer?\" Or maybe even more specifically, \"I should lie to protect the interests of a hiding Jew from a 1940s Nazi officer\"? \n\nFurther, when we're considering that last and more specific maxim, it seems like when we universalize it, it's not really that much of a problem. \"Everyone should lie to protect the interests of a hiding Jew from a 1940s Nazi officer\" seems intuitively fine.\n\nSo my question is, what maxim should we actually consider with these kinds of questions? What makes it so that the more general maxim, \"I should lie to protect the interests of others\" is what we should attempt to universalize, rather than the more specific maxim?\n\nSorry if my question isn't very lucid.",

But freezing that moment in a picture and looking  back in computer,  it just seems so bizarre to look at it.\n\nAs he famous quote \" Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent.\"\n\nThe  words hear fail to explain whats going on.  So we just need to sit bat  and enjoy whatever that it in silence.   Our experience in life is a  series of pictures/moments.    They are fleeting moments.   Thus we must  enjoy the present for whatever it is.\n\nI think the work of [Henri cartier bressant](https://www.google.com/search?q=Henri+cartier+bresson&amp;client=firefox-b-1-d&amp;sxsrf=AJOqlzVGPLCjmmd0zD3gTEI1vub23xPs0w:1677328356820&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiW3ISH17D9AhUimmoFHfjmCkwQ_AUoAXoECAEQAw&amp;biw=1318&amp;bih=811&amp;dpr=2) or [Vivian Maier](https://www.google.com/search?q=Vivian+Maier+photos&amp;client=firefox-b-1-d&amp;sxsrf=AJOqlzXKHXEwfecS9Y8TjDLB8YpGxVIotg:1677328066129&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwippbb81bD9AhUUnGoFHZFbAlwQ_AUoAXoECAMQAw&amp;biw=1318&amp;bih=811&amp;dpr=2)maybe  explain what I'm trying to say a bit better.

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/11bdchy/what_do_you_think_about_this_nietzche_reading/",
        "text": "I asked ChatGPT on how to start reading Nietzche, making sure to ask it about secondary sources as well along with primary ones and suggesting good translations. Here is the response:\n\n**Q : Can you suggest good English translations of his works, and the order in which I can read the primary sources as well as the secondary sources? Like, do I read the biography before the primary sources?**\n\nSure, here are some recommendations for English translations of Nietzsche's works:\n\n1. \"Thus Spoke Zarathustra\" (translated by R.J. Hollingdale)\n2. \"Beyond Good and Evil\" (translated by Walter Kaufmann)\n3. \"The Genealogy of Morals\" (translated by Walter Kaufmann)\n4. \"The Birth of Tragedy\" (translated by Walter Kaufmann)\n5. \"Ecce Homo\" (translated by Walter Kaufmann)\n\nAs for the order in which to read Nietzsche's primary sources and secondary sources, here is one suggested order:\n\n1. Start with a brief biography of Nietzsche to gain some context about his life and ideas.\n2. Read a general introduction to Nietzsche's philosophy, such as Walter Kaufmann's \"Nietzsche: Philosopher, Psychologist, Antichrist\" or Brian Leiter's \"Nietzsche: A Philosophical Biography.\"\n3. Begin reading Nietzsche's primary sources in the order listed above. \"Thus Spoke Zarathustra\" is a good starting point because it introduces many of Nietzsche's key ideas in a relatively accessible format.\n4. As you read Nietzsche's primary sources, refer back to the secondary sources to help you understand the context and background of Nietzsche's ideas. It's also a good idea to take notes or jot down questions as you read, so that you can return to these later when you're trying to deepen your understanding.\n5. Once you've read a few of Nietzsche's primary sources, you might want to explore more specialized secondary sources that focus on particular themes or topics. For example, if you're particularly interested in Nietzsche's views on ethics, you could read a book like Bernard Reginster's \"The Affirmation of Life: Nietzsche on Overcoming Nihilism.\"\n\nRemember that there's no one right way to read Nietzsche, so feel free to adjust this suggested order based on your own interests and needs. The most important thing is to approach Nietzsche's writing with an open mind and a willingness to engage with challenging ideas.\n\n**Q : How about reading his famous works in chronological order? Does it have an advantage or disadvantage over starting from popular entry points**\n\nReading Nietzsche's works in chronological order can be an interesting and informative way to trace the development of his thought over time. It can give you a sense of how Nietzsche's ideas evolved and changed over the course of his career, and it can also help you understand the context in which his ideas emerged.\n\nHowever, reading Nietzsche's works in chronological order can also be challenging, especially if you're new to his philosophy. Some of Nietzsche's earlier works, such as \"The Birth of Tragedy,\" are more difficult and esoteric than his later works, and they may not be the best starting points if you're looking for an accessible introduction to his ideas.\n\nStarting with a popular entry point, such as \"Thus Spoke Zarathustra\" or \"Beyond Good and Evil,\" can be a good way to ease yourself into Nietzsche's philosophy and get a sense of his key ideas and themes. Once you've read a few of Nietzsche's more accessible works, you may find it easier to tackle some of his more challenging texts.\n\nUltimately, the best approach to reading Nietzsche will depend on your own interests and goals. If you're interested in tracing the development of Nietzsche's ideas over time, reading his works in chronological order may be the way to go. But if you're just starting out and want to get a sense of what Nietzsche's philosophy is all about, starting with a popular entry point may be a better option.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo how would y'all rate this list of readings? And modifications that you would suggest for someone just starting out with this author? I mostly have a background with the general philosophical ideas of Plato, have read a decent amount of Stoic writers (because those were the ideas I most resonated with while getting introduced to philosophy from the Philosophize this podcast). And yeah, I have listened to the entire podcast series.\n\nMe personally: I was thinking of starting with Walter Kaufmann's \"Nietzsche: Philosopher, Psychologist, Antichrist\" or Brian Leiter's \"Nietzsche: A Philosophical Biography. After that I planned to move on to Genealogy of Morals, Beyond Good and Evil, The Anti-Christ, Gay Science, and then Zarathustra, as suggested here [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Hk-Y89oL24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Hk-Y89oL24). Looking at Reddit made me conclude that starting with Zarathustra was a bad idea.",

        "text": "(Go easy on me please, I'm new to this and not a scientist.)\n\nI want to find some type of connection between morality in evolutionary science. I'm speaking from the perspective of literally and analyzing what I wrote. \n\n**Literally** means reason, scientific and logical. **Analysis** is my attempt to explain the elements that constitute the hypothesized moral framework from science. And this is across species in differing amounts (applies to some, but not to others all over the evolutionary timescale). The dimensions describe the reciprocity of the base elements of species to get to a moral framework.\n\n* **Literally,** species on earth evolved to have needs. Meeting your needs and not meeting your needs have consequences. Meeting your needs means life, and not meeting your needs means death. This is the nature of biological life.\n * **Analysis,** meeting your needs is 1-dimensional (your needs) with a consequence of 2-dimensions (life and death).\n* **Literally**, species establish relations between each other to reproduce, creating an offspring. It varies between each species, but the relationship of some animals evolved into social bonds.\n * **Analysis**, the relationship between two animals is 2-dimensional (male and female). The parents' bond with the child is 3-dimensional (male and female and child).\n* **Literally**, after a social bond evolves, the species understands their needs, so then they relate those needs to the mother and the offspring. The reward is biological success, so that becomes reinforced through evolution.\n * **Analysis**, meeting your needs is 1-dimensional (your needs), and meeting others' needs is 2-dimensional (others' needs).\n* **Literally**, in evolution comes humans, which rise through the whole process of evolution to slowly become self-aware. Humans start to comprehend abstract concepts much more than other animals (again, differing amounts) like their needs being met and the abstract consequences of their needs not being met as well as the abstract consequences of others' needs not being met. In this abstraction, they can discern between pleasure and pain, and understand that in a relation to another. And this gets refined more and more with the development of spoken language.\n * **Analysis**, abstraction allows us to consider ideas through many multiple dimensions, and those conclusions are either logical or illogical. \n* **Literally** The morality evolved through oral tradition and throughout generations, passing on and building up a moral framework of what bring positive consequences and what brings negative consequences.\n * **Analysis**, the oral tradition allows humans' moral framework to transcend the passage of time, taking past information, transferring it in the present, and giving the future the potential to learn from it, which is 4-dimensional (past, present, future, and information through them).\n* **Literally** The morality evolved culturally into the formations of simple to complex written religion and the beginning of jurisprudence (what should law be?) and philosophy (rationality in morality), codifying a collection of beneficial and detrimental beliefs to order society as well as for each individual: both personal and interpersonal. \n * **Analysis**, written language does much the same as oral tradition, but adds a dimension of permanence to it: if the society somehow fails, the written language preserved in parchment or stone has the possibility of still surviving. This makes our moral framework 5-dimensional (lessons learned from the past, the present, the future, information moving from them and through them, and information in extinction).\n* **Literally** And in medieval to modern society, the morality evolved cross-culturally where information would be shared between cultures, using developments in technology such as the printing press and the Internet to spread it rapidly.\n * **Analysis**, this solidifies the Earth in preserving moral knowledge and sharing cross-culturally allows humanity to attempt to discern what is most morally true from interconnecting the moral framework of all Earth's cultures and finding the most common denominators of all cultural systems. \n\nThis is the basis of the development of morality through a scientific lens. \n\nAnd from this, I think we can derive a framework for good and evil (very abstract concepts I know). But if we take the culmination of all that is most logical and most beneficial and the culmination of all that is most illogical and most detrimental, we can create a theory on the nature of good and evil. \n\nSo the questions I have against this are: \n\nDoes this theory about good and evil make sense? \n\nIs this a good framework?\n\nIs there a rational common denominator for explaining good and evil?\n\nAm I making a presupposition in any of these areas?\n\nAm I just flat out wrong? I'd love some critique here.",
