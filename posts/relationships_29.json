        "text": "Our son was expelled from college at age 20. My wife \\[61F\\] screamed at him for several hours a day, every day. He became extremely depressed but eventually found a job as a software engineer. He re-applied to school and was accepted. He had been working full time and going to school part time.\n\nRecently he got laid off and decided to also take the semester off from school to figure out what to do. He has been so depressed lately. He doesn't answer our calls. We don't know what's wrong with him.\n\nHe was close to his ex-boss \\[46M\\] and they were talking every day. We contacted his ex-boss and found out a few things:\n\n* He has PTSD from my wife screaming at him\n* He attempted suicide after my wife screamed at him, got arrested, and ended up in a mental hospital\n* They treated him like garbage in the mental hospital and he has PTSD from that too\n\n After he found out his ex-boss and told us this, he got into an argument with his ex-boss and they stopped talking.\n\nWe know he is also close to his professor \\[33F\\] and they talk often too. We have contacted his professor but she won't tell us anything about him. She just shoos us away and tells us we need to respect his privacy. What should we do?  \n\n\nTL;DR Son got laid off, is depressed, and won't talk to us",

        "text": "so i’ve been seeing this guy since october. i really like him and i’m not sure i’ve ever felt this way about anyone before. we get on so ridiculously well, and we have similarities and differences in the best ways. we clicked pretty quickly both personality wise and sexually. i told my friend that i feel like i’m kinda falling in love with him a bit recently. however, the thing is that he doesn’t want a relationship right now so we’re kind of taking things quite slowly. we’ve both agreed that we can see other people, although i’m pretty sure he’s not really seeing anyone, as he does quite a demanding degree and has quite a lot of friends, so he barely even has time to see me and he doesn’t message any other girls (apart from his friends) other than me. \n\nanyway, on top of this i’ve kind of had a bit of a thing for my best friend for about 2 years now. last week, she admitted her feelings for me and said she’s felt the same. i see her almost every day, usually just the two of us, and there’s just something we have that i can’t really put my finger on. we obviously really get each other as we’re best mates, but there’s just this like connection there and i feel like i can completely be myself around her. i’m also obviously attracted to her. \n\ni’m now very conflicted. we had a chat about it all and she just kept saying she doesn’t believe i like her, and that i’m in love with this guy and that she’s fine with that, she just wants me to be happy etc. we then met up on friday night and kinda went on a date and ended up having sex after, which has made me start to think i should drop the guy i’m seeing for her, because she’s really great. the thing is, i obviously do really like this guy, but i also really want to see how things go with my friend. i know that she’d quite like a relationship and to settle down soon, which i do quite like the sound of. if it wasn’t for this guy i’m seeing i’d have no doubts in my mind at all, but the way i feel about him makes things harder. i don’t want to hurt my best friend, but i also really do thing we could be amazing together, and things with this guy could fizzle out at any moment. the thing is, me and my friend could try things and they don’t work, and then things could work with this guy, so i don’t want to drop either of them and i’m just quite confused and unsure of what i should do, both for what’s best for them and for me.\n\ntldr; my best friend is into me, and i like her along with this guy i’m seeing, and i’m really unsure of which one i should choose and how i should handle the situation",

        "text": "I (27F) got back together with ex (33M) and am having trouble trusting him.\n\nFor some context, my boyfriend and I were together for about 2 years. He was very hot and cold, occasionally avoidant, never told me he loved me during that time even though I had told him. He was never mean, abusive, etc, but he did have a tendency to pull away every time we got close. Eventually I got tired of being pushed away and (after much communication) ended the relationship, although it was immensely painful. He flat out told me he was emotionally unavailable and could not give me what I want, leaving me little choice but to walk.\n\n\nWe went NC for several months. He contacted me once during that period asking to meet up, to which I declined. A month later, he reached back out telling me he does love me and always has and was very apologetic which was a side I hadn’t seen from him, ever. \n\n\nI agreed to come back and we’ve been together for about 3 months now. He is being wonderful. He tells me he loves me several times a day, is open about his feelings, drives 2 hours one way to see me, calls me if he can’t see me, texts me consistently and if he’s busy he will communicate that, and in person he’s always been wonderful but here lately everything is just so passionate and amazing. I can be open about my feelings and he never gets mad or impatient, and he no longer pulls away when I communicate I’m upset. He has all but begged me to give him a chance to fix things, and he has admitted I have no reason to trust him.\n\n\nAnd that’s exactly my problem. I don’t trust him. I don’t trust that how he is acting is sustainable. It is like I’m dating a whole new man. When I explained my concerns to him he stated the last time he was open with someone he got really hurt, and that he knew early on he loved me but he was scared to express how he really felt. \n\n\n That sounds sweet and I want to believe him, but I don’t want to get hurt again. When he was hot and cold previously, those cold periods were devastating. Just as an example, I would go from hearing “good morning gorgeous”, to “good morning”, to “morning”, to radio silence even if I reached out. Those simple little words were my first indication that he was slipping away. There were so many times I felt him pulling away from me and I knew it was coming but I couldn’t do anything to stop it. And every time I lost him it hurt more than the last. So as much as I want to believe him, love him, and be happy, I just want to run. \n\n\nI don’t know what to do. How, if at all, do you go about trusting someone who you know can withdraw from you without a care at any moment? \n\n\nTLDR; Boyfriend seems to have changed after period of no contact, but due to previous behavior I’m concerned this is temporary and I will get hurt again.",

I started the talking and told her i can't treat her as a friend anymore cause i have feelings for her and i can't just pretend that i don't and maybe i should walk away from her life to move on, she kept saying that it wasn't even a break up and that she doesn't even consider me as an ex and she has feelings for me but she didn't want to show them off cause i wasn't there for her and she just needs time, we kept talking for a while and then she hugged me real tight and we made out for like an hour and it was really amazing, i spent the rest of the day with her and left and when she texted me while i was going home she called me \"babe\" again but the thing is that she still gives me mixed signals, i talked to her today and she seemed not to be interested at all and idk what to do, was it wrong to go to her place in the first place?, Should have i walked away?. Or am i just overthinking\n\nShe has many male friends at college and whenever someone tries to reach out to her she tells me about it and i can't help but feel jealous af and i don't even know why she does that, she says I'm really special to her and that she doesn't act like that around anyone else but i have problems believing that, idk but i can't fully trust her cause sometimes it feels like she just wants us to be fwb and i don't want that, i asked her multiple times about our status and she just doesn't give an obvious answer, idk if I'm being paranoid about her losing interest and catching feelings for someone else or if i have valid reasons to believe so\n\n\nTL;DR : idk if my ex is trying to get back or if she just sees me as a plan B",

        "text": "Been dating for almost 6 months and everything had been great… so far.\n\nLast night she told me that things are “starting” to get old but it’s nothing I should take out of proportion. Well today I thought maybe a little distance might help that feeling because we do spend a lot of time together and she had work so I let her have some space today and not constantly text as we usually do. She went into work and sent me a text saying to “come over” and I was confused since she had just gotten there. She then texted saying they sent her home.\n\nShe called me after and asked and I said that I thought about what she had said the night before and I see her point of view so maybe I’d just stay home tonight as we live an hour away from each other. Well she got annoyed and said she coulda stayed at work which I had no clue of since she just said she got sent home.\n\nShe also said she had gotten invited to go to an NBA game by her friend and I was like oh who? This wasn’t me being nosey just a general question. She then said “a friend”, which raised an eyebrow. She then proceeded to say she was annoyed because I coulda brought up earlier what I was thinks about the night before and then said “I gotta let him know I’m going” concerning the basketball game then hung up. That sent a huge red flag to me. Not only because she was kinda secretive about who her friend was but also because I always ask her to go to a game and she says no and now she goes. \n\nShe called back and we figured out the misunderstanding and I apologized for blowing it out of proportion and that I shoulda said something earlier in the day. She texted saying she felt like I didn’t want to see her which isn’t it at all and I said I’d Comeover but she had these plans now.\n\nMy biggest concern now is who she could be at the game with and I’m afraid it could be a guy she was talking to right before we started dating and if I bring it up, could it make things worse. I also felt because I just didn’t wanna go over this one night she might be doing this out of pity..\n\nTl;dr gf got annoyed cuz I though some space would be good for us as she said last night that she thought things might be starting to feel old. She’s now going to a basketball game with a guy who she said was “a friend” when I asked who invited her and I’m afraid it could be someone she used to talk to. Another sure if I should bring it up now as it could cause more drama right now.",

        "text": "My (26 F) best friend (26 F) have been best friends for almost 20 years (well, not anymore I guess). Recently we had a huge falling out because of some drama with a friend group and her husband being horrible towards me during the last few months of my living with them (if you check my history, you can see the post explaining more in depth). \n\nI’m trying really hard to come to terms with this, but it’s been difficult. I feel like it’s STILL not clicking in my brain that she may never speak to me again. I keep expecting her to pop back up and things will get better again, but I know that’s not the case when it’s likely me versus her husband and everyone else in her life at the moment. I’m trying to move on and just not think of it, and I’ve been hanging out with other friends in my life but it’s really hard lately. Music has always been a huge deal for us, and a lot of our bands are touring or releasing new stuff, and it hurts not being able to talk to her about it. No one else in my life has the same level of passion for this music, whereas she and I felt the same and could talk for hours about the new releases. Additionally, I’m getting married and I reached out to try and mend things because I desperately wanted her to be at my wedding, and she left me on read. That broke my heart. \n\nI took the hint and tried to focus on other things, but I feel like it then comes out into my subconscious because I have dreams about her where I try to fix everything and nothing works, or her husband verbally berates me again like he did in real life, and it’s literally like a nightmare I can’t escape. She drives a very common brand of car where I live, so I catch myself trying to see if I drive by her when I notice a similar car. I’m just heartbroken. It’s been since September since we last truly spoke and I’m still struggling. I’ve spoke to my therapist, and I know she’s right about investing in my current friends who have been there for me and helped me, but they’re all really busy and we don’t get to hang out much, and we don’t mesh as effortlessly or have all of the same interests so I feel like I can’t fully be myself. Or I can, but I guess I just don’t feel as understood by them. I don’t know what to do. She was my sister. I’m crushed. \n\nIn the past, she tended to put me in the back burner for various reasons, so part of me thinks it was only a matter of time. I always felt like I was putting in more effort with her than she did with me, but I do miss how easy everything was with her and how much we had in common. I haven’t had that special connection with any other friends, and I fear I never will again.  \n\nTLDR: best friend of 20 years hates me now and refuses to speak to me despite me apologizing and trying to fix things. I’m struggling to move on.",

        "text": "Context. Me(trans male, 18) and my girlfriend(F19) have an open relationship (seven months as of Feb 28th) currently. My best friend(gender fluid 18) a is in a relationship (I believe 10-11 months?) too. They're partially open? Their partner(NB18) has rules ofc. Mine doesn't.\n\nAnyways, so my friend kissed me earlier today. We were working and taking the elevator. Suddenly they walked over to me and kissed me. On the lips. I enjoyed it (I have a small crush on them but the type you'd not expect to act on much). I had given them one of those kiss soda tabs as a joke previously and didn't expect anything. Although, I didn't mind it. Obviously. Now though, I'm not sure on what to do since I don't know if their partner has a rule against that or not. Should I tell my partner? Should I ask my friend about it? What should I do?\n\nTL;DR\nI gave my bff a kiss tab as a joke. They actually kissed me. I'm questioning if we did something wrong and I need to know what to do.",

        "text": "My husband and I have this couple friend who we have known for almost 10 years. We hang out a lot because we vibe good and have the same sense of humor, as well as enjoy the same games together. However, the past 2-3 years we have felt they have become extremely annoying and unbearable at times. \n\nWe hung out with them tonight and I think we are both at that point that we don’t know if we want to hang out with them anymore, however we want to make sure we aren’t the assholes here.  We have noticed things recently in their marriage that seem really unhealthy and weird. I know we don’t know their marriage, but these just seem really weird to us. One major thing we feel is that her husband it seems is always trying to impress her and he baby talks to her a lot. For example, we were playing a game today and every time he did something he would go “did you see that baby???” And she has to say something like reinforcement to him for him to shut up and stop saying that, like dude you’re in your 30s. And he always make anything about something she enjoys even if it has nothing to do with it. Like if I bring something up he will be like oh just like this and it’s something she likes like her dog and it doesn’t even make sense that he brought it up. Another thing is he can’t ever just let her be and do something for herself. If my husband is driving or I am driving, her husband will go around to the car door she is at and open it for her, even if it is blocking someone from getting into the passenger side or taking forever. I get opening the door sometimes, my husband does it for me but every single time? Is that really necessary? It’s been so bad he will practically push my husband out of the way so he can get to a door first. And another example is today someone asked her to take a picture of them so she said of course and my husband was showing him something and the second she stepped maybe 2 feet away to take the picture he left my husband and went by her to watch her and then hold her hand back 2 feet back so my husband could continue explaining. I mean why couldn’t he just let her take the picture and come back? Why does he have to hold her hand the entire time we are out? Even if they are eating. It’s made my husband and I wonder if we are jealous or if we are doing something wrong in our marriage and literally have us wondering if we are being judgmental assholes or if they are overcompensating for something? \n\nHe tends to only focus on her and will do anything to impress her or make her “happy”. We were playing a game that we all play against each other but can help one another and he needed help so my husband offered to help and he said ok and then looked at her stuff and said actually she asked first so she’s going to help me. Even though she didn’t ask at all and I don’t think she wanted to help. We have brought it up before with them and nothing seems to change. We want to bring it up again but first want to make sure we aren’t crazy people. I mean if we are being jerks please tell us. I just need advice on how to handle this.\n\nTL;DR: The couple we hang out with is annoying us by their actions. Are we in the wrong or should we talk to them? We don’t know if we are the ones being weird.",

When I compliment her, she gets all nervous and blushes. She was being bullied by some people and she wanted me to stay with her for the whole day because she said she feels super safe with me. I recently got her number and she always texts me (it’s on her mums phone since she doesn’t have one yet). She always says that she misses me. Are they signs that she likes me? She found out that another girl might like me and instantly hated her and hugged me in front of her to make her jealous and even said “she looks jealous right now”.  \n\nAre they signs?

However, when she talks to her, it's all buddy buddy. She  goes out of her way to make it look like she likes people, even if she  despises her. There's even a third friend that she says he hates, but  goes out of her way to make it look like she likes them sooo much.\n\nAs  someone who is caught right in the middle of it, it makes me  uncomforable as fuck.

I’m average looking at best I guess.  I don’t know what I did in my past life to struggle with women but I haven’t any luck. I got bullied really badly all through school. Didn’t go to prom, didn’t have a date. I watched all my friends have girlfriends and have sex in high school and in college. It’s hard not to get resentful when you’re trying your best and have nothing to show for it. I’ve tried the self improvement route. I’ve put myself out there a bit more. Still no luck. Here I am, 25 still no relationship. It’s getting frustrating. I’m really starting ti give up for good. I still feel extremely bad about being a virgin. I know I’ll get bullied for being a virgin but I really don’t care anymore. I’ve had maybe one or two situations that didn’t work out. One girl I ended up ghosting because I found out she had been with 9 guys. I admit it was a bad thing to do but I don’t regret it. It’s frustrating to know pretty much every girl in your age range has been with guys and you won’t be anybody’s first. It’s intimidating and pathetic to have your first time at my age. I feel robbed. I feel robbed of experiences I feel like pretty much everyone else got. I just want a normal life.

I guess not, because she is going to greece. And yes she asked once that is it okay for me, and I replied ”yes”, but I only said yes, because she said that it is her dream to go there for a summer job and I don’t want to hold her back. I feel like I’ve wasted time and really bad for waiting 2 years just to get disapointed once again. I just feel like I could find someone that would actually find time for me.\n\nTL;DR!

Over the break, he has made some friends at his new job and one of them is another woman. This angers me for some reason and I don't know if it's a gut feeling or just because I have some issues with self-esteem and image. He reassures me I never have to worry about her and that they are just friends, he says I am the only woman he wants to be with. Yet I can't stop myself from wondering if he is attracted to this woman in any way. He has told her that he's in a happy relationship with me, but it doesn't stop me from worrying. I never lost feelings for him during the break, and he never lost feelings for me. We took the time to better ourselves so we can give the best version of ourselves to each other. We communicate and we're very open to each other, we are best friends. We share humour, and we work well together. So I think he would at least be honest. I found her socials and I believe she is prettier than me, and I admitted this to him, and I asked him if she is more attractive than me. He stayed calm, he didn't get mad that I searched her and stalked her account. He again says that I am the only woman he wants and that he only has eyes for me. He asked if i wanted him to get rid of her and I felt too bad to say yes. He says that he doesn't want to lose her or his other friends because he enjoys spending time with them. He has hurt me before and I have hurt him, but this time we are trying properly. We are much healthier this time. He doesn't make friends easily so I am guessing maybe thats why he doesn't want to leave his friends. I have brought her up in conversation about 50 times, asking for reassurance but it seems he is getting annoyed that I don't stop talking about her, and he communicates this to me and asks if I can stop talking about her. This sounds even more suspicious to me. don't know if I am overthinking or if my gut is right. Someone, please give advice, it would be appreciated.\n\n\nTL;DR \nI find myself angered by my boyfriends female friends and my gut tells me he's attracted to them.",

        "text": "So basically I was an idiot. I split up with my ex, things had gotten pretty bad and we’d both changed as people, we are not the same people that we were at the start of the relationship. \n\nI split up with him due to my mental health but I spent 2 days completely apologising to him, crying down the phone telling him this is not the way I want things to end completely and that I want for us to give things another go in a few months maybe once we both take time out.\n\nHe told me he’s not in the right headspace for a relationship anymore and that we can’t go back to the way we once were. \n\nA week before the breakup he was telling me how he can’t wait until we have our own house with our own children and the day he sees me wearing my wedding dress to our wedding will be the happiest day of his life.\n\nAfter embarrassing myself begging and pleading I decided to go no contact as I was only breaking my heart further. He kept me on all social media but today I go on and answer a few messages from friends and see that he’s now put that he is single and deleted all of our photos. \n\nHe has his location on in Snapchat and I feel like he has waited specifically until the weekend because he knows it will upset me more. I feel like this is his way of getting back at me, as if he’s out for revenge. He won’t answer me with regards to my things that he has, he just said he will bring them round when he’s free but it’s been a week now. \n\nI feel like all of this is a show to try and upset me further as he knew I didn’t want things to turn so bitter, every time I go on social media he has deleted something else. If he really hated me he would have surely blocked me by now? I don’t know why I get this feeling he is looking for me to contact him as any time I have been upset I would always message him but not anymore.\n\nTL:DR Am I being the bigger person by not reacting? Is there a chance he’s doing this as punishment and for attention?",

        "text": "Howdy, long time lurker, but this is my 1st time posting because I feel like I completely misread my situation and I’m confused now. \n\nMy best friend and I have been best friends since early high school, I’m not gonna give a whole speech, but I do love this girl dearly. \n\nSo, last Saturday night my best friend saw her ex with another girl. It was her first relationship and what not so, I get that she was riding the highs of the emotions. She wanted “revenge sex” as she calls it.\n\nHer ex was never a big fan of me. Nothing in relation to her I think, we’re just very different people. \n\nAnyways, her and I are complicated. We’ve flirted with the idea of hooking up as we both have also admit that we have feelings for each other.\n\nWell, it happened, and it went well. She told me not to use protection and that was just heaven to my ears.\n\nHowever, I did finish in her. She didn’t really have problem with that, but she was upset that I ran and grabbed the plan B from my car and I told her I had 7 of them just as a joke/giggle and she said “why do you have 7?” And I kind of was just like “yeah, I come prepared I guess”\n\nBut what really topped it off was no aftercare. She was upset that I didn’t cuddle her like we usually do, or any form of aftercare. She said she felt used. \n\nI thought because we aren’t together we should be playing it a certain way to avoid feelings being mixed and she literally said “fuck that, you of all people, don’t treat me like that”\n\nWhich looking back, I get. I did finish in her afterall, but am I wrong for taking this approach? How should I go about this going forward? I would like to hook up more often if we’re okay on some boundaries. \n\nTLDR: I had sex with my best friend, and while it went well, she did not respond well to my actions afterwards and she got pissed. I thought I should’ve kept a little distance afterwards and it might have impacted our relationship",

        "text": "\nMe and my (ex) boyfriend are both 23 and have been together since 2018. We met in 9th grade when he came to the small school I went to. After high school we began dating, and everything was pure bliss. \n\nMy family is religious and he is not, so there was quite a bit of conflict. I couldn’t handle being pestered anymore and I moved in with him. We’ve been so happy together, but last week we had a minor disagreement about the topic of marriage, and a flip switched and he said some hurtful things to me about how I have “chose” to have an anxiety disorder just like a crackhead “chooses” to start doing drugs. And that we cannot get married right now. He has always been so gentle to me, and none of it made sense. I was crushed. This went down Sunday, he left Monday and didn’t come home again. \n\nKeep in mind- we barely have disagreements and never actually have real fights. I was devastated. He was barely talking to me, just basically letting me know he wouldn’t be home again. On Wednesday I was devastated, and heard the text tone on his iPad and started snooping. I watched live as he told his best friend (who I always liked), about how he and one of his female friends had finally confessed their love to each other and wanted to start dating soon. I didn’t call him out about it right away, I was just completely shocked and devastated. \n\nWednesday night he tells me I need to leave his house. His sister came over and we packed my stuff and left. On Thursday morning I called him to confront him, he swore it wasn’t a physical affair, and we broke up. \n\nI now have NO relationship with my family because he swore he would love me for eternity, and I chose him over them. I am temporarily living at his dads house until I can figure where to go next. (His dad doesn’t even know he cheated!). \n\nThis is the only man I’ve ever been with. After years of happiness he just snapped and dumped me like I was nothing. I am shattered and lonely, and have no idea where to go from here. Please help me learn how to survive this.\n\nTL;DR my boyfriend of 4.5 years snapped one day out of no where, left me, and in the process I found out he was talking to a female friend. Then he kicked me out, we broke up, and now I’m staying at his dads house since my family hates me for dating him. Wtf do I do with my life?",

        "text": "Just found out about 15 minutes ago my boyfriend lied to me about stopping smoking cigarettes. We quit months ago together for health reasons and to save money. I walked up to him, he was wearing a hoodie and I saw the pack in his hoodie pocket. He also (supposedly) quit smoking weed about a month ago, so that he will be able to pass possible drug tests for a new job. When I pulled the pack out of his hoodie he immediately said “I quit smoking weed it’s just this.” He has lied to me in the past about a different drug after he said he quit. I have also found a comment before he left on another girls fb about how he thought she was cute, and he has lied about feeling sick to get out of work. The part about work wouldn’t be such a big deal (at some point most of us have done that), except he also makes a point to say stuff like “My boss knows I would be there if I could,” “I wouldn’t leave early unless I was feeling bad”, etc. He makes such a point to tell me how pretty I am and then I find that comment on a girls profile. He makes complaints about wanting a cigarette, how hard it is to quit, and then I find a pack in his pocket. I’m starting to feel like a pattern is emerging. We have been together going on 2 years. I would like to make this work, and I don’t feel like getting caught smoking cigarettes is the end of the world. But at the same time I am not happy about the lie, and becoming increasingly uncomfortable with the fact that this is not the first time I’ve caught him being dishonest. Any advice?\n\nTL;DR boyfriend is starting to form a pattern of misleading/sneaky behavior. Nothing major has happened, but not happy about being lied to either. What to do?",

        "text": " tl;dr I feel like I'm jiving with someone, but am concerned about love bombing-  how do you tell the difference?\n\nI (28F) have recently been seeing someone (29M) and on one hand feel more comfortable with him than I have with anyone in the past, but have been seeing more and more about \"love bombing\" recently. I am having a difficult time determining if that's what's going on, or if I am just looking for problems where there aren't any because I am afraid of commitment.\n\nWe talked a great deal before actually meeting and when we did meet, it was very natural conversation for a number of hours which only ended when the coffeeshop we were at closed. He pushed intimacy early, although was very respectful when I put the brakes on things, though I can tell it is a priority for him. He also has made a number of comments implying our future very early on, which I could honestly see but would never actually vocalize at this point. He asks fewer questions of me than I feel is typical for someone who is genuinely crazy into someone, that being said, he remembers everything I say and is clearly listening. When I've expressed concern that he may discover he doesn't like me as much as he thinks, he is very quick to reassure me there is no way of that happening (which lets be honest, there is always a chance). He does have lower than average self confidence which I have read can be a factor in this, but also doesn't do excessive flattery/generous gestures/etc.\n\nNormally people getting overly attached too quickly makes me really uncomfortable and unattracted to them, but I'm really into this guy. I don't want to throw away something that could two people genuinely jiving (albeit one being a bit awkward and less confident) but I also feel like there are red flags I am ignoring. How do I best tell the difference?",

        "text": "My last GF and I started dating in 2015. We dated for 6 years, and eventually broke up mutually because we realized we were just way too different and had settled into a \"roommate\" phase. Looking back with clarity, we were only together because we gave each other attention and didnt want to be alone and became comfortable with each other. When we broke up, I felt next to nothing. I still think about her kindly, we just would never have worked passed where we ended up, and we both knew it.\n\n2 months ago I met a girl who I had everything in common with. Our hobbies, interests, family backgrounds, food, music, you name it. Our life goals aligned and we both wanted simple, caring family lives. I had no idea what it was like to truly fall for someone until I met her. She was gorgeous, sweet, affectionate. Neither of us could keep our hands off each other and in her own words we had the best sex ever. Her hugs melted right into me and I'll never forget the feeling of her running her hands through my hair. I found myself obsessed with little things about her that I had never even noticed about other people before, like her voice, her laugh, her nose, her hands and ears.\n\nAnyway, it was her idea to become BF and GF on our third date together. She asked me how on earth I was single, and that she'd like to be my girlfriend if there wasnt anyone else. I agreed, and things went great for the next few weeks. She however had 2 children, and we lived an hour away from each other - so we only got to see each other once a week. We would text and flirt 24/7, and I loved waking up to her good mornings. She would tell me things like she hopes I never leave, that she wouldn't leave me, how much she liked and cared for me, how no one has ever made her feel this way, etc.\n\nOne night when we were supposed to have our weekly date night, she didnt talk to me at all for a few hours and passed when we were supposed to meet. I called her and she had gone out with friends and had one too many drinks. Fine, but she didn't even communicate and I thought she was blowing me off or that something was wrong because she hadnt even told me she was going to get day drinks with her friends. This ended with us getting into a fight, but eventually I drove to see her and we made up. That night she told me how sorry she was, she'll never fight with me again, and that she loves me and doesnt want to lose me. Two days later she broke up with me.\n\nShe started saying things like she thought we were going too fast, even though it was her initiating things like dropping the L word first, saying we should be bf/gf, that she'd never leave, making me meet her parents because she got too drunk to drive to my place instead, etc. She said she didnt even know if she was really ready for a relationship given that she had 2 kids and we lived an hour away, that she wanted to figure her own life out before settling with someone. I was heartbroken, but let it go. The next day I told her I'd give her a week of space until our next date day that she could think about whether we could start over and go more slowly, or end things.\n\nWe didnt talk for about 3 days. She came over that weekend, and said how much she missed me, and we hugged and made out for about an hour. Then she said she agreed to start over. From there, things were starting to go well again. It wasn't as flirty, but that was the idea, right? We still however made our usual date night plans, and I was super excited and looked forward to it all week. Until a few nights before it happened, she completely blew me off one night and didnt talk to me at all. Im not naive, and know there's only one reason you completely cold shoulder your SO. She was either planning another breakup, or was cheating. I didnt sleep at all that night.\n\nI texted her in the morning, half jokingly asking how her date was. She immediately blew up at me, saying I dont trust her, then started saying the same things as before about how she doesnt want a relationship, she's glad we're finally over, that Im a walking red flag for being so mistrusting, etc. She then blocked my number. Later that night, she unblocked me, and we fought some more and both of us were clearly angry and said really mean things.\n\nAfter a couple back and forth messages, she eventually broke down saying she was crying because she really wanted us to work but that she had cheated on me the night before. She says she realized how much we really would have worked as soon as it was over, but it was too late. She broke the one thing thats unforgiveable to me in a relationship. So we had a heart to heart for about 4 hours about how much we meant, how we'd miss each other, and that we love each other, but that it was best if we didnt talk again or see each other ever again after that night. After we talked and she said her final I love you, she blocked me a final time. I havent heard from her since in 3 days.\n\nI know it was really short, and looking at it from this perspective it seems like I got \"love bombed\" pretty hard, but the sweet, gorgeous girl who I had everything in common with and fit perfectly with me was still underneath it all.. and I really did love her. Despite having multiple past girlfriends, flings, one night stands, friends with benefits, whatever, I had no idea what it was like to truly have feelings for anyone. I'm 30 years old and never fell for anyone the way I did for her; and never experience heartbreak the same way as when she ignored me that night and admitted the truth the next day.\n\nI miss her more than anything and have been a wreck since. I'm a drone at work who can barely talk to anyone. She took me on such an emotional fucking rollercoaster that my head is so messed up. I dont see myself trusting anyone in a relationship ever again, and it's just getting worse as I get older. If someone who told me they loved me more than anything could throw me away like a worthless piece of garbage for a one night stand for some meaningless tinder dick, what does that say about me. I feel miserable. I've battled suicidal thoughts unrelated to this for years now, but the thought of someone who I thought I could finally be happy with betraying me and getting with someone else like I was nothing is just burned into my head, and I cant get it out. The first day we didnt talk after that last night I spent the day staring at the walls hearing her voice I loved so much in my head and wondering what I could do to myself to get it out.\n\nI need help and someone to talk to, I dont know where else to go.\n\nTl;dr: betrayed by the first person I tried to date in eight years, experienced heartbreak and cheating for the first time in 30 years",

He’s overall really great but lately he’s making me feel uncomfortable. When Mark’s sober he’s extremely respectful but when he’s drunk he gets kind of handsy. I used to be able to brush it off but the last two times we’ve been out it’s been really bad.  I was extremely uncomfortable. This morning Mark called and apologized for “acting like a clown” but I told him I blacked out because I felt embarrassed. I was happy that he brought it up, because it means he knew he was wrong. I figure this might be problem-solved, but at our intramural soccer game today I couldn’t shake the comfortable feeling. I was overthinking every move he made. Going out with my friends now makes me anxious because I’m afraid it’ll happen again. How do I handle this? \n\nTLDR; my guy friend is handsy while drunk and I don’t know what to do",

        "text": "18 months ago my M40 wife H F39 suggested we date another woman. Wasn't a supprise as I always knew she was bi. She has always jumped from 1 thing to another so I figured she was looking for something.\n\nSo we joined some apps and she gets speaking to a woman K F40. They went out &amp; it was nice to see her happy. I love H &amp; thought this was something that I couldn't give her.\n\nH then put me in contact. I though at this point I'd be a third wheel, I was wrong, it was electric.\n\nIt all happened quickly, we all dated, we hung out, our kids went on play dates we were doing DIY. In couple of weeks we were sleeping together and in a month we were starting to come out to friends. It was intense, but it was magic. K and I had a connection that was unreal &amp;I fell head over heels.\n\nI dont blame H for being jealous but I saw a different side to her. K was trying to make it work but things just got worse until I had to break things off. I was gutted. What was worse was I couldn't see H the same way.\n\nI didn't sleep for days and I asked H for a break to think about things. I was so angry &amp; questioned everything. H always got her way again and again, I struggled to think of anything I'd had control of in years, all the frustration just snapped.\n\nThen I fucked up. I needed some relief and somebody who understood, and I just fell into K.\n\nOver those months I must have broken things off with K 6 or 7 times, but it kept going back &amp; at the same time I'd told H I wanted to separate. Things got nasty.\n\nH was talked about killing herself and had to go on meds, I got counciling, K became a mess, but worst of all our kids were suffering and that killed me.\n\nI love K but it must have been torture. I wish I'd have manned up at the beginning but I kept hurting her. So I stopped.\n\nH ballanced out. What was happening to my family broke me, so I agreed to try to work things out, but I told H what had happened with K, we couldn't carry on with that hanging over us.\n\nH was upset. I didn't want to push her over the edge so didn't confess everything, but the worst of it. Call it cowardly, but I just wanted to keep a part for me. She pushed for every detail, but I had to draw a line and hope we could move on.\n\nThat was a year ago. I've not seen K since. Its not been easy, but the kids are doing much better and H's mental health is on the up.\n\nThe problem is I'm not over it. I miss K &amp; the way she made me feel, more like me rather than the person I pretend to be. I can't help but ask what if that was it. My chace at 'the 1'.\n\nI can't rip my family apart and cause any more hurt. So here I am, miserable and fucked. This is my story, a guy that got pulled apart and is trying to hold it together. Any advice?\n\nTLDR my wife (F39) &amp; I (M40) started dating another woman (F40), we fell in love and my wife got jealous and it all ended badly. I almost left her, but I ended up patching this up. It's been a year but I'm still not over it.",

        "text": "Throwaway.\n\nThe title is blunt but in essence it's true. I am a gay woman who finally got the confidence to come out in my 40's after my mother died. Once I came out, I soon started dating this amazing woman (let's call her Ellis). It's been 2 years and we just got engaged last month.\n\nDuring the course of the relationship, I met her family and they were all so wonderful and supportive of us. Luckily, the family I have left are really supportive as well, but had my mother been alive I can guarantee I would not even have had the courage to come out. My late mother was a control freak my whole life, intensely religious and homophobic to the point where she would regularly join her church's public protests against the LGBTQ+ community.\n\nA few months into our relationship, Ellis asked me about my mom. And I just lied. I lied about how my mom was such a wonderful person and how much she would have loved Ellis. I regularly made up these sweet stories about her to the point where Ellis expressed regret that she never got to meet her, and even wants to keep an empty chair dedicated to my mom at our wedding. Ellis also wants me to mention her during our vows in order to honor her memory.\n\nI am honestly not sure why I didn't just tell Ellis the truth to begin with. I think I was just so insecure knowing that my mother would have absolutely disowned me had she been alive.\n\nI just feel disgusting for being dishonest to my future wife, but I don't see how I can come clean to her now. I also feel that in a way, lying about who my mother really was has messed with my mind, because my real memories of her vs the ones I have been making up to make her seem like some wonderful person are so different.\n\nI am so afraid that if we mention her or save a seat for her during her wedding, my relatives and siblings will question it because they know my mother's true nature. And then my fiancee will find out, which is my worst nightmare. How do I deal with this situation?\n\nTL;DR I came out as a gay woman later in life and told my fiancee that my dead mother was a wonderful person who would have loved her, even though the reality is that my mother was a toxic, abusive, and intensely homophobic person. My fiancee wants to honor my mother at our ceremony but I am afraid my relatives will comment on this because they knew her true nature and my fiancee will find out I lied and hate me for it.",

        "text": "Me (29M) and my girlfriend (24F) have met at our shared workplace 4 and a half years ago. I was already working there for few years, she was a young girl moving to a new city for work. She is a beautiful and I was single, so I fell for her right away. We started dating soon and, since we both were looking for a place to stay (I had issues with my family, she was temporarily living at a friend’s place), we rented an apartment and moved together after a bit over a month.\n\nShe wanted to pursue college, but her family could not afford that and neither could she pay for it with the salary she had then, so she could not. I offered supporting both of us financially so she can go to college and pursue a career afterwards, and she accepted. She quit her job and started studying.\n\nNow here's the problem:\n\nAfter 1.5-2 years, she started complaining that I work too much and don’t spend that much time with her and that she also has no friends in this city, so she feels alone. Her college does not require lots of attendance, and we also went through lockdowns and stuff so she was studying online. I explained to her that I have to work to be able to support both of us and to save some money for our future, but I also understood her point and started taking more breaks, going out with her, going to vacations and so on.\n\nSex life was becoming awful. We had sex once a month with a bit of luck. Most of the time, once every 2 months and only if I initiated. I assumed her sex drive just lowered, so I discussed it with her multiple times. I was not asking her to match my drive, but rather to find a good compromise for both sides. She agreed each time and said she understands, and that things would only get fixed for a few days. Then it went back. Then I stopped even bringing up the subject. Sex with her started feeling like I was some sort of abuser, there was no pleasure in knowing that she doesn't want it, but she probably just did it so I won't bring it up anymore.\n\nCollege is also an issue. While she's not doing terribly, she's not doing exceptionally well either. It seems like she's more focused on obtaining her diploma than actually learning something in her courses. I initially thought it was because maybe she did not choose the right field, at least that's what she told me. So even if I already paid for one year in that field, I encouraged her to quit and start studying another. Same results.  \nShe lacks the initiative to do anything. If I don't tell her I think she should do something, she never does anything. She just watches TV shows and reads literature all day. She has no interests, no hobbies, no friends, nothing.\n\nWhen all these things have started happening, combined with all the stress from work and just daily life matters, I started having depression episodes. It came to the point where I would drive to a secluded area and just stay there, staring into the void. I still have them. It's just too much of a responsibility carrying the weight of figuring out the lives of two people. I can't handle it. I wanted to help her achieve more than she could when I met her and I'm afraid I ended up ruining her independence for her. I can't handle the depression and bitterness in which I live anymore, I feel like I need to break up with her, but she relies on me so much that it feels like selfishness if I don't keep supporting her at least 'till she finishes college and gets a job. Does anyone have any advice?\n\nPS: I apologize for my bad English, it is not my first language.  \n\n\ntldr: I wanted to help my girlfriend by financially supporting her through college, she ended up being lazy and our relationship being miserable, but I cannot break up with her 'cause she relies on me too much. Does anyone have any advice?",

We now live together with 2 other roommates, but both of them live pretty busy lives. There’s never been anything between us and it was never an issue, we were always dating other people and we didn’t have interest in eachother. \n\nFor the past 4-5 months though, we’ve been spending more time together, everyday really, and I realized myself catching feelings maybe 2-3 months ago. I’ve tried to ignore it and move on, because it wasn’t there before, but it’s only gotten worse. To make things more confusing, we basically act like a couple, which is why I think the feelings may be reciprocated, but I’m not sure. \n\nWe plan shit in advance basically like dates, I cook for her and I probably 4-5 nights a week, we go shopping together all the time, we try new restaurants together, go to the gym together, do fun stuff together constantly. And people we’re around definitely think we’re dating. \n\nI know that regardless of what comes of the situation, we need some new boundaries, whether that be in a friendship or relationship because if the feelings aren’t reciprocated I need to be able to move on, but I feel like it’s reaching a point where I need to talk to her about it. She’s the person I feel the most comfortable around, and it sucks to not be able to tell her how I feel straight up. I guess I’m mostly just afraid of hurting our friendship, because she was still one of my closest friends before all this started anyways. Its hard too because it’s been great recently, but I also can’t help but think what it could be. \n\nTL;DR: I’m confused about my situation with my best friend and am not sure if she feels the way I do, but I don’t want to ruin our friendship either.",

I asked her if she was leaving me, but she said no, that she wanted us to find a way to move forward.\n\nA week after this conversation, she was getting colder and colder with me. For the first time in 4 years, I looked at her iPad when she left for work and saw that she was falling in love with someone else.\n\nNow my girlfriend has left me. I had to move out of the house and she wants to sell me her share of the house. I don't want to go back to her because this is beyond repair, but I can't get her out of my head. She hasn't fought for us. It had always been clear to me that she was the woman of my life and everything has fallen apart in weeks.\n\nShe was always madly in love with me and in a few months she has gone to not having a doubt that she doesn't want to be with me.

        "text": "My SILs (22F, lives with us, 35M and 33F) van broke down. Her bf tried to fix it and ended up leaving it worse than it started.\n\nShe gave up and had her parents co-sign a loan and bought a pre-owned car (a crappy ford per her bfs advice smdh). She was behind on rent and I asked her I could buy the van off her and I planned on fixing it up and selling it (it’s a Toyota sienna so the value made it worth fixing even if the cost was a couple grand which she couldn’t afford). So she asked if she could skip a couple months rent as payment and we agreed. \n\nI was working on the paperwork to have the title transferred when a police notice was posted on the van that it was going to get towed so I had AAA take it to a mechanic. I gave the mechanic my info and explained the situation but apparently the van has been there before so when they diagnosed it they called my in-laws instead. They agreed to pay to fix it and called me. They asked me “if SIL can return her new car can she have the van back?”. I said that was fine because I hadn’t put any money into it. They said if she can’t return the new car (it’s already been 2 weeks and she has been smoking weed in it EVERY DAY) that they would give it to us to sell.\n\nNow for some reason my SIL thinks she got her van back even though she hasn’t returned her car yet (she’s trying to get the weed smell out). She went and picked it up and is so excited. I’m kind of upset even though all I did was have it towed.\n\nI think it’s moreso her entitlement and how often she gets rewarded for doing nothing. She recently planned on pocketing all the profits on puppies we are raising even though my husband does 90% of caring for the puppies because he got laid off from work. She offered him $500 even though the puppies are selling for $7500!! I told her that he was losing money not working and taking care of them and that they are going to have to hire someone if they aren’t going to pay him fairly (we never agreed to having puppies so I don’t even know why they [MIL and SIL] decided to breed them). She finally ended up offering $2k instead (after yelling at her mom for not paying us enough).\n\nIt’s such an awkward conversation because we really don’t care about the money. She isn’t paying that much for rent and we are flexible if she is struggling. But the amount of work she expects others to do while she reaps the rewards is frustrating. I don’t know how to convey this to her without sounding greedy. I feel like she should be paying for the puppies even though she is hurting for money and we aren’t because we never agreed to take care of them and they are A LOT of work. I feel like she shouldn’t just assume the van is hers just because it is fixed. \n\nUgh.\n\nAnd I right to be mad? \n\ntldr; My SIL acts entitled to things that other people put the work/money into and it’s making me really angry.",

        "text": "Okay, so I want advice from a guys insight into a current relationship. I have been with my current boyfriend for almost three years. He moved in with me during Covid which we never really talked about but kind of just happened I didn’t know anyone where I moved besides him. What bothers me a lot and I’m not sure if is completely valid is that I pay for all of the rent and pretty much everything in our lives. I’m 25 and full disclosure it’s money from my dad so not like I’ve earned It all on my own. I’m totally ok with being the one to pay for now but what bothers me is that it doesn’t seem to bother him at all. I feel like as a guy it would maybe demasculate you somewhat. He doesn’t offer to pay for really anything I even pay for his food very often. And even with guy friends so many of them wouldn’t ever let me pay for my own food. Rent also is not cheap I pay $15k and he makes enough to where he could offer to contribute even like 2k and I’d be ok with that but he instead saves it and/or invests it which I think is odd.\n\nTL/DR: I pay for everything which doesn’t bother him and he never offers to pay",
