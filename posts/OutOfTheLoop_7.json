I can't seem to find what comments were said. Only quote I even seen is something about who didn't like that 50% of blacks do not like whites. To which Scott says that sounds racist. Is that the comment that somehow pegs him as racist?   \n\n\nI'm super confused. Assuming that is the comment. If 50% of one race doesn't like another race, wouldn't that be called racism? Like if 50% of whites said they do not like blacks, that would also be racist right?  \n\n\nI truly don't get the whole thing and admittedly am kind of a slow learner. So help me understand this whole thing.",
