        "text": "Buckle in - the post is long - and OPs an idiot!\n\nThere will be moments in this post where you think \"Wow OP - you're an idiot\" - and you will be right! I'm early my early 20s, may be a dumb kid, but please hear me out, because I don't know how to handle the situation I'm in, and am so unfamiliar with the medical system, that at this point it scares me, and I'm afraid this life changing medication will be taken away from me. Please, if you have advice - give it up.\n\nI was diagnosed just over a month ago (QB test - full force effort - bombed it). I knowingly, out of fear of being denied this medication, (idiot moment 1) neglected to tell the psych that I have been diagnosed with hypertension. I did however mention that I have white coat syndrome in our first meeting - which I also have, and when she took a very high reading (\\~155/\\~105)\n\nI've had a crap diet, never worked out really, etc, my blood pressure was regularly in the 130/\\~95 area. In moments of severe stress, my blood pressure shoots up to 150/110 easy - it happened in high school frequently, where I was diagnosed with hypertension. (idiot 2? It was a gamble, see below) I don't think that this (the raise of \\~20 points) is abnormal.\n\nAfter I started taking my prescription, in the first week I was averaging fairly healthy blood pressure readings (110/\\[high 70/ low 80\\]) - which I expected because I always suspected that my blood pressure was mostly related to psychological phenomena.\n\nA week goes by and I a fix my diet, stop smoking/drinking, start working out, start taking heart health supplements (I've been severely depressed since my early teen years, this is essentially the first time I've really taken care of my health.) During this first continuous week I didn't see a reading above 110/85 - **I'm living the gold standard of blood pressure** in the mid 90s/60s - and actually enjoying my life.\n\nI keep this up until recently - the first follow up after I've been given this prescription. On the drive to the office I need to take a major highway - somebody is always riding your ass, and if they aren't doing that they're zipping by me while I'm already doing 20-30 over the limit. I nearly miss my exit - but I was 30 minutes early anyway.\n\nI check my blood pressure in the car - its pretty high at 130/90, no shock given traffic conditions and stress, but this worries me more. I get in the office, sit down, and start thinking about my blood pressure. The appointment time comes, and I sit for another 15 minutes. I can see the Doctors door, just like the first visit, I wait an additional 10-15 minutes and stew over my blood pressure, with her doing... something quietly by herself (frustrating and annoying - I know other patients are late, but I was 30 minutes early come on). I worry if it is high that they will take the prescription away. I'm called in, I'm asked how I am, and its the next thing that comes out of her mouth. It came out VERY high at ***170/120***. This is the highest I have ever seen it - by 10 and 10 at least.\n\n80% of the rest of the appointment (\\~11 minutes) was spent talking about cons of the medication - she would not give me any control over the conversation, didn't keep me long, and shuffled me towards the door. I explicitly said that I the dose I am on is perfect, yet she somehow convinced me (Mostly focusing on the *only problem I had -* sleep, which is no longer a problem - but she was probably worried about my BP) to lower it and fills the prescription. She also demands I see a primary care physician (haven't had one since 2 years before covid) and have them call her after they do something about it (presumably as an unspoken stipulation on the next prescription.)\n\nI do think I should go to another Doctor about the high blood pressure readings (You: \"Hey maybe this guy isn't an idiot!\"), at the same time (You: \"boo!\") I know my blood pressure is in a healthy range 97% of the time - this outlying situation (feeling the weight of the potential that this life changing medication may be taken away from me) and white-coat syndrome, will be present in the following doctors appointments.\n\nThese are just extremely stressful moments for me, and follow ups aren't going to change anything. I *carry* my blood pressure cuff on me (as of last month - knowing the risk I was taking - I was careful), I'm in a engineering position and constantly dealing with complex and stressful problems, my BP is never this bad. These doctor visits are not like that - the course of the rest of my life depends on me being able to continuously acquire this medication. I get physical symptoms just by being in a doctors office: I get red splotchy skin, and eyes turn red like I'm high, I know these are symptoms of very high BP from my days in high school. \n\nThis is seriously scary for me - I can't go back to the life I was living. I was an impulsive animal with demons that couldn't be silenced. I ***refuse*** to go back - even if I am risking my life (which I don't think I am). It was not a life worth living - well certainly not a life to go back to, now that I've seen the neurotypical side of the fence.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, the crux of why I'm here is largely venting, but I don't want to go to another Primary Care Doctor, and I know this Doc is just trying to look out for my health, but she just won't believe I have healthy BP. I'm paying for her time, I should be the director of it, and she shouldn't be trying to sway me like she did today. There is ***NO WAY*** she would give me the time to express all of the above - I didn't even have time to give her all of the pros or cons I've found in taking the medicine over the last month.\n\nShould I find a new psych? Or just try be really assertive next month? This one just seems so disrespectful/insistent its not worth salvaging. \n\nShould I find a primary care Doc? \n\nAnd I can't trust your opinion more than I can a real doctor, but just want to hear some opinions/experiences for:\n\nIf my BP gets any lower than 90/60, isn't that a problem too? It happened once in this past week - I was fairly light headed (I woke up this way). I know that it would happen if I went on something to lower BP.",

        "text": "Hey y'all - first time posting here, but long time lurker! I've been so grateful for the tips I've picked up along the way from you lovely folks so wanted to share my strategies for maximizing health/nutrition with minimal effort. \n\nWhen I first got on stimulants, they were life-changing in terms of ADHD management, but my appetite plummeted. I was busy and stressed, and pretty much stopped eating. As a result, I experienced severe mood crashes at the end of the day. Also, although the stimulants definitely masked this, my cognitive functioning was impacted too. \n\nThese are the strategies I use to stay healthy when I can't be arsed to cook anything major. Many of the ingredients below also take a long time to spoil, so there's less pressure to meal prep super carefully!\n\n*Note:* *I am a relatively inactive woman recovering from quite poor eating habits, so the calorie count here may be lower than is healthy for some of you. This is just for inspiration, and I definitely recommend adapting it to meet your personal health goals!*\n\n**Breakfast (prep time under five mins):**\n\n* Smoothie: frozen mixed berries, about a cup of spinach, oat milk, and two scoops of Vital Proteins protein powder (18g protein + 20g collagen).\n* Banana\n* Multivitamin\n\n**Lunch (prep time under 1 min, appetite at its lowest so pretty light):**\n\n* RX energy bar (literally just egg whites, dates, nuts, and berries depending on the flavor - another great source of protein!)\n* Carrots and hummus\n\n**Dinner (total prep time 20mins, active prep time under five mins):**\n\n* Quinoa (use rice cooker to cook, takes about twenty minutes total but less than five of active work)\n* Microwaveable chicken sausage (45 seconds in microwave)\n* More carrots\n* Big bowl of spinach (I usually eat plain or with dressing just because I am maximally lazy but you can also top with whatever salad toppings bring you joy)\n\nI know none of this is rocket science, but I hope it helps someone here!",

        "text": "Hi all!\n\nI was really hesitant to post this but I truly need help and advice. I have suspected that I have ADHD for a long time now, and have finally decided to do something about it. I completed ADHD assessment forms, which were basically almost 20 pages of symptoms, habits, and such. Not sure why, but the way the psychiatry system works where I am is that they take anywhere from 2-5 appointments to do a complete assessment. I have already had 2 appointments with the psychiatrist and have my third (and likely final) appointment coming up in a few weeks. \n\nSo far, the psychiatrist doesn’t think I have ADHD, but that I just have severe anxiety. She says that I’ve never missed deadlines, always done well in school, and that I don’t have trouble learning new stuff, despite being incredibly bored out of my mind when I do learn everything there’s to know about a task/project/whatever I have to do.\n\nNow I can’t completely disagree with that, I do struggle with anxiety a lot, but I just have a bunch of things that I don’t think can be explained by anxiety. For example, I can’t just “do” things, they either have to be something I’m interested in, or there’s a deadline creeping up on me. I will procrastinate until the end of time if I had to, not because I’m not capable of planning a completely manageable schedule to split up the task(s) I have to do into smaller bits, but because I CAN’T get myself to do them. My brain will literally be screaming at me to get up and do stuff, but my body physically can’t. I feel like I’m paralyzed and I struggle so so much with school work as a result. Things that normally wouldn’t take the average person a long time to complete if they just focused on them to get them done take me at least twice more time to complete because it’s hard to get myself to start and focus. Yet, when I do start working on whatever it is that needs to be done, I’m not leaving it until it’s perfect. I’m so tired of living like this because I keep delaying things to the last minute, even if they’re simple tasks, and then when I do start working on them, I would forget to get up to eat and even avoid using the washroom because if I stop, I can’t get myself to go back to working on it. These aren’t the only things I struggle with, there’s so much more. I made a whole list of symptoms going into my first appointment with the psychiatrist, but these are some of the things that bother me the most: feeling paralyzed, being bored so easily, and not being able to do any task unless there’s some sort of urgency/ it’s interesting to me.\n\nI really need help. Am I just exaggerating or do you think I have ADHD or is it just something else? I’m just scared because the psychiatrist doesn’t think I have ADHD because I’m a “perfectionist”. Don’t get me wrong, it’s not that I’m trying to prove that I have ADHD or anything like that, I just want help and to stop living this way. I also don’t really know what to say or do at my next appointment, I’m so scared of being dismissed. Thank you for reading. Sorry for any typos/grammar issues. \n\n\n\nTLDR; Suspected ADHD for a long time. Psychiatrist doesn’t think I have ADHD because I’m a straight A student and have never missed deadlines, thinks I just have anxiety. But I’m scared I’m being dismissed because I struggle with doing tasks unless they’re urgent/interesting, feeling paralyzed, and getting bored so easily. I need help/advice.",

        "text": "I’m 28f, pre-nursing student, and mom of two young kids. I was diagnosed at age eight and have been on a variety of different meds for different diagnosis my whole life. I was unmedicated for ADHD from ages 14 to 26 due to substance abuse problems. At 26 I started a low dose of ER Vyvanse and had horrible side-effects. Then tried ritalin ER and the side-effects weren’t as severe, but were still there, so I got off of it. \n\nI’m in a super hard A&amp;P class that’s requires a ton of intense focus and memorization, which are not qualities that come innately to me. I spoke with my doctor and we decided to try Ritalin again, but this time IR. we started with a super low dose, but now I take about 50 mg a day. \n\nSince then I’m able to study and retain information much better, my test scores went up, I don’t take three hours to write a two page paper. So, the meds are doing what they’re supposed to! \n\nMy issue is with the side effects. For instance today I was so in my head that I literally could not do any work because I was fixated on an unrelated outside issue. To the point where I am calling friends asking them for advice multiple times a day. I am way overthinking all of my interactions with people and second guessing if I did something wrong, or how a person perceived me. I.e. today when I said “have a good day” to my daughters teacher and she replied with “yup”, i kept thinking about what I did to make her not like me. Admittedly, I am an overly sensitive person and I DO tend to overthink things even when unmedicated, but not at all to this extent. And, everything is annoying me, feeling depressed, or numb, and just feel overall weird. \n\nI feel like I can’t survive with out the medication academically, but I’m wondering if this is even worth it. I’m trying to get into nursing school, and once (hopefully) accepted retain a good GPA, but idk if it’s possible without Ritalin. And life is feeling pretty shitty right now while I’m on it. \n\nHas anyone experienced this and have insight on how to manage it? Thanks in advance.",

I was decently focused in school in general (although I did daydream a small bit and I had to fidget slightly when focusing, if that means anything).\n\nIs it at all possible to have ADHD and not either be insanely hyperactive or completely inattentive and actually just be somewhat focused?",

It’s my day off school today, and I’ve just been in bed for hours since I woke up and took my meds… I don’t really feel bad about it (I have pretty bad sensory issues so I know I need my rest and recovery days from going to uni and dealing with the sensory overload of the city) but I just keep thinking that It’d be nice to do something. But I just don’t ! I don’t know if It’s depression because I don’t really feel sad.. I’m just lacking the drive to do anything, even fun stuff. I just love the comfort of being in my bed and my room, and knowing I have no immediate responsibilities to attend to until tomorrow morning. But at the same time I know logically that If I do just stay in bed ALL day long and do nothing I will end up feeling sad at the end of the day. \n\nThe feeling is like, I think of something to do and bc of meds my brain is like ‘yeah, we could do that’ (whereas unmedicated brain would go in to instant overwhelm and panic) but there’s no action following the thought, I just can’t make myself get up.. and I want to, but I don’t, but I do. My mind confuses the hell out of me sometimes!! \n\nDoes anyone else experience this? What do you do about it? Embrace doing nothing or try and push yourself to do something?",

My passion for my hobbies and work have always superseded any negative or anxious feelings.\n\nOf course we all have days where we feel down or the anxiety gets the best of us, but in general I was happy and able to function.\n\nRecently (after getting covid and some serious life events last year) I’ve noticed that this nervous energy has transitioned to true, debilitating anxiety.\n\nI’m struggling to identify what the root cause is for these feelings. If I’m able to find a task or hobby that I can fully engage my consciousness in, my anxiety melts away. If I am engaged in it long enough, my mood also lifts significantly to the point where I actually feel happy and excited about whatever I am doing.\n\nAfter a period like that, if I have truly forgotten “myself” and my feelings, the return of consciousness to the present moment and remembering the anxious/depressive feelings almost seems foreign.\n\nIt feels as if I could distract myself long enough, the latent anxiety and associated depression would disappear permanently. Yet, usually after a few hours or sleeping overnight, the negative feelings return.\n\nDoes anyone have any advice as to whether this is more anxiety/depression related, or if the function of distraction as an effective “cure” means this may be primarily an attention deficit disorder?",

As someone who was constantly pushed to their limits in many areas of life and often over-“worked”, I used to be able to get by in life. Of course, as I grew up, my undiagnosed symptoms began to show and affect my daily life. I was often told to “push through” or “suck it up”. I also was punished for my “behaviors” (symptoms) I couldn’t control growing up. Now, in response to my ADHD symptoms, I noticed I become very frustrated with myself and well, beat myself up constantly. \n\nAlso, I overwork myself as I feel the need to “prove myself” as I was always told growing up that I never put in effort, cared, or bothered to try. I used to be able to push myself to the limits and actually function properly in life but apparently, my brain and body could only handle so much. Now I’m suffering the consequences of pushing myself too hard when I thought I was lazy. With medication and eventually, therapy (waitlist) I noticed that I have to re-learn everything about myself and how to take care of myself. I’ve been working on being kind to myself and focusing on myself right now. I know that I won’t immediately see the full effects of accepting and learning to love myself but the problem I am having is that I automatically revert to negative self talk and being patient with myself. \n\nBeing patient is difficult and I am trying but I think part of the issue is that I’m used to doing so much stuff in my day. It’s difficult to actually rest sometimes because I feel lazy and unproductive but I know that I need to be patient and that it’s okay to rest. If I don’t rest, I only risk making my issues worse. Yet, I can’t help but to feel that “urge” or “itch” to get “ahead” in life quickly. I hope that made sense. I’m just wondering how other people have managed patience when dealing with yourself?

        "text": "ADHD inattentive male here, I've tried everything. I live a relatively happy life ever since I started cooking my own meals and exercising, but it doesn't fix the search for dopamine in my downtime. Drugs don't help. Stimulants make me antisocial, kill my hunger, and overly content (though are quite euphoric). Alcohol shrinks your brain and makes me so content that life gets extremely mundane very quickly. I was addicted to cannabis for 5-6 years since it made life managable and fun, but I didn't want my partner to see me high and with drug-induced enjoyment in my eyes so I quit (also ruined my memory and made me slow, weird, and paranoid). Nicotine was honestly just stupid. I just brew a cup of white tea before 9am and that is the most I do nowadays (I'm a slow metabolizer of caffeine so my sleep suffers if I have any more psst this point). I've been sober for months and have never felt better, I'm not magnesium or vitamin deficient. I play guitar and love doing so (though I feel like I played guitar better on cannabis x caffeine from the dopamine boost :c). When the time comes, I can get into gear and be on top of my game. When I'm playing games that matter (kahoots at work, playing fast paced music, taking calls at work, etc), anything that requires a push of adrenaline, I come out ahead of all of my peers. I work from home at the moment, and every break I get I step outside and soak in the sunlight and have a flavored toothpick. I genuinely enjoy my environment and my life, the problem is that it's not enough. I will sit at board meetings scratching my nuts or looking up random things on my phone for any bit of pleasure. I will pop sunflower seeds or chunks of fruit like I'm addicted. I cannot stop seeking pleasure or euphoria.\n\nI feel like if there was a way to make the tasks I need to do (guitar practice, mundane work tasks, etc) more like a time-based game, I could enjoy my life more. I feel like I progress at incredible speeds in everything I do, but with the relative absense of enjoyment. I laugh in the moment thinking about how bored and pleasure seeking my brain is, which helps my mood, but not the problem. I'm looking for a habit-based solution, and was wondering if anyone else was in the same boat?",

        "text": "When you read and learn about the modern human brain. You will find a sufficient and substantially evidential number of studies proving the modern human brain has hardly changed, if at all from the caveman brain. \n\nThat's why there's medicine to fight off illnesses. That's why we crave social belonging and a \"tribe\" to call a forever home. That's why you crave at least one person in life to look after you as you look after them too.\n\nSo is ADHD an unnatural mental illness? My answer is no. No one back then needed to retain information and knowledge spanning more than a year's worth of knowledge. Life was simple. Recognition of food, enemies, and different faces was there sure. But there was no need to be exposed to 5,000 things daily (hello computer, tiktok, tech jobs), no need to be acquainted with more than 10 people in your entire lifespan, although give or take, was usually up to 30. And also certainly there were no needs for individual identities and boundaries.\n\nSo the next time you feel bad about ADHD, don't. I see it becoming more prominent in this century than all the decades before. And it's not just because it's finally getting attention, but also the natural brain response and civilization becomes increasingly advanced and different from, what I call, the blueprint caveman brain.",

Both my brother and sister are diagnosed with adhd and after learning more about it and relating to pretty much all of the symptoms I felt like I needed to talk to someone. I was asked a bunch of questions that I think I already filled out ahead of time online that were the likes of “Do you have trouble with organization?” “Do you lose things?” “Do you use drugs?” Etc. I was told I could have adhd and was asked to do a computer test that I was told I needed to pay out of pocket for ($200). It was the CPT 3 test and was administered by the receptionist. It was about 15 minutes of pressing space bar when a letter that wasn’t X was shown and was honestly pretty easy because the pattern was noticeable and I’ve played video games my whole life. I left with a follow up in 3 weeks and no other information. Is this how a psychiatrist evaluation is supposed to go? I feel like I just paid hundreds of dollars to have someone do an online questionnaire for me and didn’t actually learn anything or get any help. I am sad and scared that I just spent so much money and am still going to be struggling :(",

Not once during my time flying have I had an issue with my disorder affecting my critical thinking skills and my ability to fly. \n\nSome of you thought it’s dangerous. It’s not. Pilots ALWAYS have a checklist with them. These checklists are followed step by step each time a student or a professional pilot prepares for a flight. \n\nThere’s a checklist for doing the walk-around the aircraft. Taxiing. Takeoffs and landings. It’s extremely beneficial because we always go through it. Not only that, in regional and major airlines there’s always TWO pilots in the cockpit. And depending on the plane like an A380 or a B747 there’s also the flight engineers. \n\nAviation is a passion of mine, and it’s something I excel at. I’m always composed and focused in the cockpit. \n\nMoral of the story, don’t let our disability be the stopping point of doing something you have a passion for. Especially don’t let the people even on this subreddit tell you otherwise. If you got a dream, go work for it and don’t let people tell you otherwise. \n\nI’ve come far in my journey and I certainly won’t let people especially on this sub tell me otherwise when they don’t know a damn thing about aviation and the safe steps we take to become safe and great pilots.

I never truly did a deep dive into ADHD and criteria or diagnosis or anything about it to be honest. I almost cried a few minutes ago because I have never felt more like a functioning person. It almost completely changed how I’m able to perceive what’s happening around me. I feel like my brain downshifted and slowed enough for me to take part in life. Everything felt different but better. I could hold conversations and it was meaningful. I was able to be productive and do notes and work that I wanted to. My friend who was keeping an eye on me for the day even made a comment that I seemed to feel better/happier since I was able to function and that it was the calmest he had ever seen me. I feel so light and easy that I might be able to sleep tonight (which has always been a severe struggle for me). \n\nThe only problem is that I don’t know what to do now. I don’t know if I want to go back to how I was living cause I certainly wasn’t functioning or liked it previous or now. But I don’t know how to go about getting an official diagnosis. Do I see my PCP or go to a therapist or psychiatrist? Idk if there are ADHD specialist in my area. I feel kind of lost. Any advice or resources or even linking to another thread would be helpful. \n\nSorry if the post is not appropriate I wasn’t sure what to do lol",

Should I wait longer for their response? If so, how long should I expect the wait to be? I just don't see why reaching a conclusion would take them this long. They literally told me during the test that my performance on one of the tests(CPT) was very indicative of ADHD (but they also said it didn't mean that I 100% have it--I understand this clarification).

        "text": "I work as an Industrial Mechanic, and because of traffic, my commute home is about an hour to an hour and 15 minutes. Every single day I struggle with my eyelids \"getting heavy\" and almost falling asleep. I have tried blasting music so loud the car shakes, chewing gum, or singing along to the radio but it does not work, I struggle to keep myself awake/alert. Most recently I have been listening to an audiobook and still keep almost falling asleep or having close calls. What makes me think its an ADHD stimulation or lack-of-stimulation issue is that if I am actively doing something that keeps my brain engaged, like talking on the phone, scrolling Spotify to choose a song, or driving like a maniac at high speeds then I have no issue falling asleep.  I don't want to get into a car crash so I can't scroll my phone while driving or be driving extremely fast and erratically, and I can't rely on my friends always being available to talk on the phone when I'm driving, so the only way that I have found that keeps me awake is slapping my face as hard as I can over and over every few minutes to wake myself back up. Most people just say \"get more sleep\" except I struggle to sleep more than 6 hours a night and wake up at least 2 or 3 times a night. All the way home I tell myself to nap when I get home but then get home and cannot nap because as soon as I'm not driving I wake back up. I need suggestions on how I can keep myself awake/alert while driving because my job requires me to drive and it's not IF I crash it's WHEN and I don't want to hurt anyone when I do.",

I’m not sure if I’m allowed to post here or not but here goes.\n\nOkay, so I’ve recently been having a few issues with my girlfriend and looking back on my past they’re things that have been consistent for my previous ones and I’d like a bit of insight.\n\nWhen she brings an issue to me, I go into the issue trying to understand what is going on, why it’s happening, and how we can fix it, but as the conversations go further and I try to understand more she gets more and more frustrated and things get heated.\n\nOnce things get heated then all understanding goes out the window and I’m too focused on the argument at hand to take a step back and make her feel heard and seen, and that her issues are valid.\n\nLooking back on past relationships it has been the same. An issue comes up, I try and break it down to get an understanding, things get heated then it all goes out the window and ends in a fight.\n\nI have a feeling this is an ADHD related thing and if so, have any of you guys been through anything similar?
