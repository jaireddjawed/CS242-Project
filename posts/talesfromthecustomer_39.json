        "text": "This was a few years ago, but I always thought it was a cute story. Thought I might share it here. \n\nA few years ago when I was going to college there was a cosmetics program at my school. (Pretty sure that's the wrong term for it.) Anyway, students could enroll in this program to be a hairdresser, do nails, etc. All that good stuff. \n\nOn campus, they had a small hair salon where students could practice on paying customers. Other students got a discount when they had their hair cut there, and there was always at least one or two teachers around supervising to make sure their students were doing everything right. \n\nBeing cheap, a friend and I decided to get our hair cut. One thing about my hair is that it's very thick and sleek. Most of the time my hair cuts are spent with the hair dresser just combing through it and getting my hair down to a manageable level to start hacking it off. \n\nWe both got paired up with our respective people to hack our hair off, and the lady I got was very nice, but nervous. Right off the bat she asked if would be okay to wet my hair down a bit (it makes it easier to comb I guess?) I agreed and let her wet it down. \n\nWe talked about how I wanted my hair, and I told her I just wanted her to cut off about ten inches of hair. She agreed and started working. About ten minutes into cutting she started to get really nervous. We had been sharing some chit chat and she suddenly stopped. \n\nHer: Oh no.\n\nMe: What's wrong?\n\nHer: I made a mistake! -starts to panic-\n\nI'm paraphrasing here, but she quickly called over one of the teachers. \n\nHer: Mrs. X, I made a mistake!\n\nMrs. X: -studies the spot where some hair was cut a little to short- What happened?\n\nHer: I'm not used to working with this kind of hair! It's really thick and I've been having a hard time cutting it. What do I do?\n\nThis entire time they're fussing over me another teacher comes over to see what's going on. At this point I do see some of my hair was cut a bit to short and crooked in one area, but pressed down against the rest of my hair I honestly couldn't tell it was like that. \n\nMe: It's okay, it'll grow back. \n\nHer: Are you sure? That's pretty noticeable.\n\nMe: Yeah, it's fine. My hair grows back like a weed. Besides, my hair is so dark you can't really see it. I didn't even notice until you pointed it out. \n\nHer: -fidgeting and squeezing her comb- Are you SURE? I'm SO sorry! I've never worked with hair likes yours before. It's really thick. \n\nMe: -laughs- Yeah, it's fine. Don't worry, other people I've had cut my hair say the same thing. It's hard to work with, but it'll grow back. In a month you probably won't even tell it's there. \n\nIt took a few more minutes to help calm the girl down, and one of the teachers even offered to finish up my hair cut instead of the student. I told them it was fine, she could practice on my hair. She did a pretty good job for the rest of the hair cut, but she did move a bit more slowly while cutting to make sure she didn't make any mistakes. \n\nWhen it came time to pay the teachers gave me a discount for my \"messed\" up hair. (I really couldn't see anything wrong it and told them so.) I gave the girl a large tip, and as we were leaving the teachers thanked me for being so nice since it was good practice for the student. \n\nAll in all it was a pleasant experience. Also, the girl who cut my hair did graduate from the college and the last I heard works in upscale salon in town. ",

        "text": "I'm not a server. I work in fast food, and I respect the waiters and waitresses so much (my aunt is one and I know how hard you guys work). \n\nTonight, I went on my first date (ever!) with the sweetest guy I know. I took him to this little Korean restaurant near my dad's place (since we're both in high school, but I'm the one that has the better paying job). It's always really packed because it's the closest to authentic Korean food one can get in America. It's great. (It helps that Im Asian, I love Asian food, and I like introducing people to Asian food.)\n\nSince the place is packed, their two servers/hosts are running around trying to serve the 20 or so tables, most of which were full. There were two empty 2 tops, and those were taken by a Chinese couple, and my date and me. \n\nGranted, the service was a bit slow since everyone was running around everywhere, but its always a nice and cozy experience. They got to us whenever they could, and I appreciated that. \n\nHowever, when the Chinese couple got their bill, they were discussing a tip. (I am Chinese, I speak both fluent Mandarin and Cantonese.) in Mandarin, the woman goes, \"I don't want to tip them. Don't tip them.\"\n\nI was completely floored. Sure, it took a tiny bit to get a table as the really sweet waitress was cleaning it off just as you walked in the door. Sure, it took a bit for your food, but they had about 4 cooks and 20 full tables. Sure, the servers may not have been the most attentive, but you try it out during dinner rush. Fast food isn't the same thing, but when you're rushed, you might accidentally be that tiny bit less friendly because you're doing 75,000 things at once. I get it. But saying right after that, \"They get paid enough\" is not okay. I don't know about the laws for wages for waitresses and waiters, but that's still not okay. A $0 tip on a $40 order? Honey. Please. People need to eat too. \n\nI got so mad. \n\nMy bill was $22.\n\nI paid, in total, $34.\n\nBecause everyone needs to eat, and if they practically live off their tips, they'll need it. My date was shocked (Because he's white af and can't understand anything besides gamer and English) until I explained, then he was good. \n\nBut wow. \n\nThis happens to waiters/waitresses often, and I don't get it. Perfectly fine service, and no tip. It blows my mind, especially since waiters and waitresses are (often) paid less than minimum and rely on tips to get by. *mind explodes*\n\nYall have a nice night now~ I hope the waitress who got my $12 tip feels slightly comforted by it",

So I decided to call customer support at my ISP. Mind you, I had recently received a new modem because my old one had died. \n\nThe operator ran me through the standard procedure of rebooting the modem and asked me, whether I connected to it wirelessly. I said I'd have both wireless and cabled devices which were connecting to the modem just fine and he sort of casually mentioned that problems with my WiFi connections were to be expected since \"I had not booked the wireless option\". \n\nThis, albeit unrelated to the problem at hand, puzzled me and I said \"But I am and have been connecting just fine so far?\". And his reply was - I kid you not: \"Yes, but WiFi is not enabled on your modem. There may still be **leftover WiFi rays from the factory** which is what you are experiencing. They will run out shortly and if you want to use WiFi afterwards, you have to purchase the WiFi upgrade.\"\n\nYeah. I did not argue with what I assume is either an attempt to scam elderly people or what a completely technical imbecile operator patched together as an explanation by himself. Are the WiFi rays supposed to come through the telephone line or what?\n\nI did not purchase that upgrade and my leftover rays seem to just be enough for my desires... my connection problems, turns out, were affecting all customers in my larger area.",

        "text": "Before I begin, I should mention that the customer in this situation is not myself, but a very close friend of mine who trusts me for a lot of her computer tech support needs. I should also mention that I am not currently a professional in IT, but I grew up around computers, have built my own desktop, and am currently in school to go into the IT profession.\n\nNow, to start of, a few years ago my friend got an expensive high-end gaming laptop from a large rental store chain a few years ago and has had many problems with the store's tech support in relation to the laptop. Just recently, she got the computer paid off as well as an extended warranty for it, but had problems with it after installing Windows 10 (the manufacturer doesn't have Windows 10 compatible drivers out yet), so she sent it in to get it fixed. However, the rental store said that in order to fix it, they'd have to wipe the computer and reinstall Windows 8. Preferring not to lose the many years of important data on the drive, she told the rental store to do NOTHING and send the computer back to her.\n\nHere's where the fun begins: when she got the computer back, she was told that they replaced the **motherboard** which was causing the problem, and gave her the old \"motherboard\" back with the laptop. She finds that when she starts the laptop back up, it's running Windows 8 and none of her data is on it. Later on, Windows 8 forces an update and fails, corrupting essential data for the operating system (something that's uncomfortably common with Windows 7, 8, 8.1, and 10). She manages to get to the BIOS and run a diagnostic that came with the computer and sent me a picture of the error code last night. I go and look up the error code (presented during the hard drive test) and found that it was for a hard drive failure. Later that night, she tells me that she had her boyfriend (also a very close friend of mine) replace the new \"motherboard\" with the old \"motherboard\", with us going back and forth with me insisting that everything, including the error code, pointed to a hard drive issue and that the motherboard likely had nothing to do with it.\n\nFast forward to tonight, I get out of my late class and catch a ride home with a friend, eat dinner, then go out to the friends' house to take a look at the laptop myself. I get there, start taking it apart, and she points out the part that had the problem, which I was already looking for anyways. I unscrew the part and, unsurprisingly, it was the **hard drive**. She tells me that everyone at the rental store told her it was the motherboard that has the problem, but having literally build a computer myself I could immediately tell it was a hard drive and not a motherboard. We spend the next hour trying to get either hard drive to work, with the newer one having an irreparably corrupted Windows install and the older causing the laptop to sit at a black screen immediately after receiving power. We plugged the older one into her boyfriend's tower (which he built himself from the ground up) only to find that Windows wouldn't even register that the drive was connected despite obvious physical signs that the drive was powered and operational.\n\nTL;DR - Rental store tech support doesn't know the difference between a motherboard and a hard drive and also can't follow directions, thus royally messing up a laptop that my friend paid around $2000 for over the past few years.\n\nEdit: A piece of context that I forgot to include: This rental store allows customers to purchase items at a higher price and pay it off over time. This is the reason my friend bought the laptop from here, as she didn't have $1000-$1500 to put down on it right away so she opted to pay $2000 a little bit at a time periodically.",

        "text": "Hello my fellow connoisseurs. Tonight's tale comes very quickly after my experience so please excuse me if I am not so eloquent as I am still trying to recover from shock. This week is both state testing and parent teacher conferences. Add on the fact that both of my children came down with strep this week and I have fully thrown out my super mom cape. \n\nBecause I still have to feed my children, even though all I really want to do is pop open a bottle of wine slide into a nice warm bubble bath and pretend I'm a pretty pretty princess,  I decided to phone it in.   Being as I just braved the supermarket because my oldest son's teacher informed me at his conference that I was most possibly the worst parent ever because he had broken his crayons and I hadn't replaced them!  Oh dear!  Heaven forbid he might have to actually use half of a crayon.  I remember using the tiny nub smaller than my pinky nail where you had to roll it around to cover the area. But no we can't have that for our precious snowflakes they have to have perfect crayons. (Never mind the fact that I work with his art teacher who loves the fact that he has crayons in the first place). But I'm getting off track this isn't about the crayon baron nor is it even about the supermarket. \n\nAnyways, because at this point I could care less if my kids were eating week old newspapers I decided that I would allow them to choose where we ate dinner as I in my state of exhaustion/passivity I was likely to choose the liquor store and feed them olives.  So very enthusiastically, which is the only way my children know how to express themselves, they cried out for a certain chicken place that is overseen by a friendly old man from the south.  It wouldn't be my first choice but hey at this point I'm not really caring. So we pull in and they beg to eat inside. I'm not wild on the idea but did I mention how empty my f*cks meter is at this point?  So we walk inside to find the holy grail of chicken lovers!  A buffet!  Ugh I hate buffets.  First because it is a cesspool of germs, the food is usually not kept well or stocked. (You know that dried out little chicken wing that no one is desperate enough to take but they can't refill the tray until all the chicken is gone)   Finally and foremost I find myself overeating to compensate for the outrageous prices and let's face it a little more to love is fine until you can no longer sit in a rowboat without capsizing. \n\nBeing overcome with aww f it I proceed to pay for our future heart attacks.  As I patiently wait for my receipt I see something moving across the counter. I look down and bend closer to see two cockroaches scudding towards me.  I did not have enough time for my brain to register that they were on an Olympic race for the darkness under my hand in order to move fast enough.  I screamed as they started scurrying up my fingers and I began shaking my hand like an epileptic with Parkinson's.  The clerk who has been standing there holding out my receipt turns a definitive shade of green and red as he grabs the manager by the shirt and drags him over just as the offending insects dislodge from my hand and land in front of him on the counter. Thinking quickly the manager grabs a napkin and squishes the offenders.  My son who up until this point has been silent in fascination at this spectacular show suddenly finds his voice and begins yelling \"Mom did you see that?!  What the heck was that I've never seen a bug like that what was it?!\"  Still in shock I'm unable to reply as my nine year old son looks at his brother and yells \"It was a cockroach!  My science teacher showed us a picture of one last year!\"  \n\nAll of this happens before I'm able to react. The manager looks at me and apologizes and says he will refund my money and dinner is free. I looked at him like he had lost his mind and just request a refund. He proceeded to spend about ten minutes trying to figure out how to refund my card. After giving me a refund I see that the two construction guys behind us who have witnessed this whole episode are still there.  I make eye contact with one of them and the guy says \"hey I don't mind a little extra protein with my chicken.\"  I choke back on the vomit as I herd my children quickly from the restaurant.  I called in a complaint to corporate from the Arby's drive thru.  And no we didn't get any chicken nuggets. Once home I hopped in the shower and played out the scene from Ace Ventura complete with the crying and wailing of \"I can't get clean!\"  Okay that's a bit of a exaggeration I actually just scrubbed my hands raw and coated them in Purell (btw that burns I don't suggest it). \n\nTl;dr. I don't need any extra protein. ",

        "text": "Hello folks! Hope you guys get better service then I did today :) Well, at the moment any service is better then what I got.. Onto the story!\n\nSo the boyfriend and I had to run some errands such as pick up cat food, milk, etc. We drive over to the closest store which happens to be the store that rhymes with Bal*Fart.\n\nHe wanted some sandwich meat and since its just the two of us, we only needed a quarter of a pound so to the deli we went. Boyfriend wandered off to look around at some of the other offerings around the area while I waited at the deli counter. And waited.. And waited some more. \n\n Now there is multiple workers standing around... 3 workers (Im guessing one was a store manager) we're standing to the left of us talking. 1 other worker was wiping down a slicer.\n \nThis one in particular has looked up at me MULTIPLE times but hasn't said anything, nor stepped away from the slicer. Even once I waved at her and she immediately ducked her head back down to scrub harder at the slicer... So I said \"Excuse me..?\" no response. \n\nThe 3 to the left looked at me, then went back to talking. So by this point, boyfriend came back and asked \"Whats up?\" and I responded to him \"I don't know.. Do I have invisibility on or something?\" \nHe said \"I'm okay with the presliced, it's more than we need but it's better then waiting here.\" \n\nWe walk away, get about 8 feet away when Deli Slicer Girl decides THEN is the time to yell to us with an annoyed voice \"Uh... Ma'am! Did you want something or what?\" \n\nI look back to respond and see her, standing at the counter, arms crossed and a smirk on her face... \n\nAt this point I didn't bother to respond actually, and just walked away. This changed my attitude from just being annoyed and shrugging it off to I'm now writing an e-mail to the higher-ups. I'm also not impressed with the store manager that stood to the side and didn't saying anything.\n\nThis entire time, there wasn't any other customers waiting with me. So it's not like she was waiting on anyone else.\n\nTL;DR - Ignored at deli counter, got some attitude when I gave up waiting (7+ mins) now e-mailing higher-ups. \n\n\nUpdate 2/22 - So i'm guessing I got the store manager that was standing to the \nside because the response was \n\n\"We sometimes have quick staff meetings which is why the group of 3 were standing off to the side. Also please be aware that we have certain tasks to complete multiple times throughout the day to make sure the department is sanitized and presentable. Remember this the next time you shop with us. \"\n\nwith some other mumbo jumbo outlining the deli duties and such... I'm not impressed... That is a copy/paste from the email itself.\nI also took a poke around yelp.com and found out that my store is only 1 star with more than 10 complaints and no complements. I guess i'm changing stores even if it means I have to drive farther.",

        "text": "So this happened quite a long time ago. But there was this one Italian restaurant my friend and I found online one sleepless night when we wanted to order food in and it was almost 4am and practically every delivery place was closed. It quickly became our favourite place to order from, whether it was for take out, or to dine-in. \n\n\nSo I think this is one of my funnier stories with an incident involving a restaurant, this is not something I'm like \"oh my fucking god, they suck!\" about, I loved this placed, but I moved cities, so I don't get it very often now, only when visiting friends. But anyways, every time I ordered the first few times, it was great. It was a decent price for the portion of food you get, and the quality of it. \n\n\nSo one night my grandmother and I decide to order for ourselves. She either always got the ravioli or the spaghetti, and I always got the fettuccine alfredo. \n\n\nWe get it, we pay for it, open mine up... It's just noodles. Okay maybe the sauce is at the bottom on the tray, I always put it on a place anyways. Put it on the plate... Where's the sauce? Uhm ooookay. Call in, they apologize, they send another one out, and it's dripping in alfredo sauce. Okay good. \n\n\nA couple of weeks later we decide to order again, same order, as usual. We get it, pay for it, open mine... Where the hell is the sauce??? Put it on the plate. Nothing. Now I'm thinking, maybe the noodles just absorbed it? That's possible, it's happened before with ramen for me. Try them, nope, just noodles. Call it in, they send out a new one, all's good. \n\n\nWe decide to order from them again... You guessed it, same thing. And this kept happening. \n\n\nSo after this happening at least 6 times, I decided the next time I order it, I will tell them, while ordering, \"make sure the alfredo sauce is sent along WITH the noodles.\" \n\n\nSo that's exactly what I did. It helped the fact that the one who took my order over the phone was a really cute waiter who worked there, I recognized his voice. He was a really nice guy. But yeah. \n\n\n&gt; Waiter: And is that all you would like to order today?\n\n\n&gt; Me: Yeah, but uhm, can I request something?\n\n\n&gt; Waiter: Uhm, sure, what would you like?\n\n\n&gt; Me: Can you make a note to make sure the alfredo sauce comes with the fettuccine? \n\n\n&gt; Waiter: What? *starts laughing* Is that... Is that something that's happened before? They didn't put the sauce in? *laughs harder*\n\n\n&gt; Me: Yeah it's happened quite a bit, so rather than waste some noodles this time, I thought it would be better to ask for it. *I'm also laughing, though that might be because I had a crush on this guy, heh. I was a teenager, so that was never going to happen, oh the boy crazed years... I got off topic, anyways*\n\n\nAnd yeah, he actually made a note on the bill [I laughed so hard when I saw it](http://i.imgur.com/bbdWKMR.jpg?1) And every time after that, I requested it, never had that issue again.

We'd read they have really good burgers so off we went.\n\nThe woman at the front said we could sit anywhere we wanted.  We found a two-person booth.  The woman dropped our menus and our server took our drink orders quickly. Once our drinks came the server took our order.  At this point, I realized the table was dirty.  It just had some sticky drink rings on it, so I tore off part of my napkin, dipped it in my water and took care of it.  I'm not really that fussy.\n\nBefore our food arrived, a party of six came in.  There is no table in this place that would seat 7 people.  They pushed two 4 tops together right next to our booth, such that there was about a foot of space between our table and the people seated at the six-top.\n\nThis made me extremely uncomfortable as I require a decent amount of personal space.  No worries, I'll just suck it up.\n\nThe six top consisted of 4 adults and two young boys.  Instead of sitting the young boys on our side, the two men took those seats.  The first man sat down and instead of going around the table on the other side, the other man decided to squeeze through that one foot of space.  His butt dragged over our table.  Ick.\n\nThen their waiter repeatedly squeezed himself through that space, dragging his butt across the edge of our table.  Double ick.\n\nThe could have eliminated one two-top by the front of the restaurant and put the six-top there with plenty of room, but they didn't.\n\nI know a lot of the places in my town can't afford to turn away customers, but if you make me eat at a table that people are dragging their butts across, I'm not going to come back to your restaurant.",

        "text": "\nFor those that don't know. *waffle dining restaurant* is an American diner that is spread through the south like crabs on pubes. They are EVERYWHERE. And most of them typically aren't a high quality establishment. \n\nI've always tried to be respectful to people. Especially when I know where someone is coming from when they have to work holidays. I've done it before plenty of times, you just suck it up and get the job done. But this lady, noooo. She had to let everyone know her terrible problems.\n\nIt was Christmas Eve, and there wasn't any food to eat at my MIL's house, so instead, my wife Anna, her sister, and I are out looking for something to eat. Everything is closed but *waffle dining restaurant* in this small town so I went in because I had no other option. \n\nIt was pretty packed. Every seat taken except a booth that still had plates and a couple dollars tip. I waited for about 5 minutes, just standing at the doors. But nothing in happening, so I go sit down at this table, and start cleaning it off and stacking the dirty plates. I know how difficult it can be working in a restaurant, I've done it before. \n\nBig lady waitress walks by, grabs the tip, and walks away again. I was so shocked, I didn't know what to do at first, had no idea how to react to that, because it was so unexpected.\n\nSo I've been at this table for about 10 minutes, when she walks over and grabs the dishes, slowly, and puts them away. \nYay, progress.\n\nAnother couple minutes go by as she walks back and arranges our silverware, on the napkins, slow as molasses the way waffle place wants them done. So I finally interject.\n\nMe: don't worry about the arrangement, it's fine, we can distribute them.\n\nBL: ...\n\nNo eye contact, just totally ignored me. At this point I'm now furious but don't have any other options. There is no where else to eat.\n\nI wait longer and she comes back to get our drinks, again, takes her sweet time. I've been here for over 30 minutes and haven't even ordered yet. \n\nBL returns. Holding notepad.\n\nBL: whudda Ya'll wunt.\n\nWe order, and it comes out decently fast, about 15 minutes. But the order is all fucked up. Sides are wrong, things missing.\n\nMe: hey, I ordered the toast, there isn't any here, and she had grits. Not Mac and cheese. \n\nBL: Tch, alright theen. Fine I go getcha sumpin else.\n\nShe comes back over 10 minutes later with the correct order. Then her BF comes in and she is conplaining about how back her feet her in those heels, and how much her back hurts. \n\nThis woman's disdain is so apparent other customers are looking at me like, \"are you gonna say something?\"\n\nWe eat, I ask to speak to the manager when I go to pay. \n\nWRM: Waffle Restaurant manager\n\nMe: that girl just gave me the worst service I've ever had, I'd like to file a complaint. She won't be getting a tip.\n\nWRM: sorry, we have been getting complaints all night. We need her here right now, not enough staff to cover since it's Christmas.\n\nI began filling out one of those, \"how was our service\" cards\n\nMe: what is the number to someone higher on the chain, if like to speak to them. Because she shouldn't be working here, or anywhere waiting tables.\n\n*BL is looking at me with her pissed off looking boyfriend.*\n\nI get the number, file my complaint. Then I leave, discussed the experience with the others in the car. Only to find out that my sister in law, felt bad for the girl. And gave her a $7 tip because she felt bad for her. ",

        "text": "This story happened a few months ago at a higher end grocery store that had just opened in my area. My family and I wanted to check it out for a couple reasons, partially because we had never been to one and had heard they were cool, and partially because a former employee at our family farm had gotten a job managing their produce department and we wanted to see if we could say hi to her. \n\nWe walked in and just looked around for a bit, checked out the food court since grocery stores around here don't usually have those, confirmed that the old employee wasn't working today (oh well), and then did a little shopping since \"why not, we're already here\". We're already in the produce department and my dad who is a bit of a foodie and fond of cool types of produce (comes with being a farmer I think) makes a bee line for the display of truffles packed in rice. For those of you who have never seen them before (the reactions I've gotten from telling this story make me think its not uncommon), truffles in this context are a type of mushroom. My dad has had truffles before, so have all of us in the family (he likes to make us try things at restaurants), but hes never actually bought a truffle to cook with himself, and he thinks now would be a good time to try it. The case with the truffles is locked, which surprises exactly none of us since the listed price is $999/lb, so we flag down an employee to try and get them to open it so we can buy one. As I mentioned earlier the store had just opened, earlier that week in fact, and so the first employee we found didn't even know who had a key to the case, but said they would go find someone for us. We said that was fine, my dad waited there, and the rest of us went off to browse/shop in other areas. \n\nTime passed, probably about 15 minutes of the stuff. I helped my little brother pick out some shaving cream and a razor since hes learning how, grabbed some chicken for lunch tomorrow, and wandered back towards the produce department to meet up with the rest of my family.\n\nMy dad is still there, waiting, case unopened, but coincidentally the manager with a key is walking about 7 steps behind me and shows up to open it before I can even ask \"is he still not back yet?\". He opens the case, asks my dad how many he wants (\"one, and make it a small one\"), and picks it out with tongs to put in a little baggie for us. Then he walks over to the produce department scale to weigh it. My dad at this point is acutely aware of the fact that not only does the scale not seem to be tared to ignore the weight of the bag, but there are several grains of rice stuck to the truffle that made it into the bag that he is about to pay a thousand bucks a pound for, but he decides to wait and see what it will cost before pointing that out. One problem thought, the scale doesn't go that low. Apparently this was the first time they've tried to sell a truffle, and the scale cant handle something that light, so the manager says \"oh we'll just call it 10$ then, since that's the smallest amount the scale could measure\", slaps a sticker on it, and walks away. Now my dad and I (and probably at least most of you reading this, if not all) instantly realize that hes just priced it higher than it should have been, since the scale not reading it means its lighter than the amount that would cost 10$, but we don't care enough to fight it since we've waited this long and want to get out of there, plus $10 wont exactly break the bank, its probably only a dollar or two extra.\n\nWe walk up to the counter, everything else has already been paid for while waiting for the truffle, and hand the baggie to the girl working the register. She stares at it all confused. the manager had been unable to make the scale print an actual sticker since the scale wasn't actually reading anything, so he had just slapped a blank one on and written \"$10\" on it, but this wasn't going to fly with the cashier (she probably thought we put the sticker on ourselves and were trying to steal something that cost way more or something), so she flags down HER manager. The guys shows up quickly at least this time, wearing his best \"I'll give you whatever you want if you don't cause a big scene\" smile, and is just as confused by the sticker as the cashier was. Like I said, first time this store has sold a truffle. He starts making it up as he goes along and tries to weigh it on the scale built into the register. Five minutes later and hes still working on it. In case you couldn't tell yet, this is a very, very small mushroom. Eventually he gives up, hands us the bag and says \"**I guess its free then. Oh well, it's not like it's lobster**\"  and walks away. At this point there's no way in hell we're going to argue with him considering how long its taken to get here, and we just walk out figuring we bought enough other junk that the store still made money off us so we don't have to feel too bad.\n\nwe shaved the truffle over some homemade pizza, it was very good.\n\n\nTL;DR- Grocery store had no idea how to sell a truffle, but its no big deal, it's not like truffles are something expensive like lobster.",

        "text": "So here we have a loose change menu. For those who don't know what it is, it's a couple of things that are sold quite 'cheaply'. For example, the chicken n cheese, the cheese burger, small fries etc.\n\n\nSo for the past 2 years, they have been tweaking the chicken n cheese, upping the price, using less cheese, etc. And you can't have those loose change stuff in a meal.\n\n\nMy sister loves chicken n cheese. Thats all she eats, and I eat them too occasionally. So I usually buy (for her), 1 chicken n cheese, a medium fries and medium coke. Here are some interactions where I will me M and they will be C1, C2, etc\n\nInteraction 1.\n\nM: Hi, can I have chicken n cheese, medium fries and medium coke please?\n\nC1: Would you like to put it in a meal? It will be cheaper.\n\nM: Can u do that? I thought u couldnt put loose change menu in meals.\n\nC1: u can put the chicken n cheese in a medium meal n it amounts to 5.95 (cheaper)\n\nM: ok thank you.\n\n\nInteraction 2:\n\nM: Can I have a chicken n cheese in a medium meal pls?\n\nC2: I'm sorry you cant put loose change menu in meals. \n\nM: well couple of days ago someone did.\n\nC2: Im sorry we cant. \n\nM: huh, ok then. How much will it be?\n\nC2: $9.95 thank you.\n\nM: ...\n\nSo after a couple more times, I get C1 again and she says they can do it. This time I ask her for the receipt n put it in my wallet. The next time, they refused, i showed them the receipt but to no avail. They still refuse. \n\nSo unless I'm lucky, I have to spend $4 more to get the same stuff when I need to buy fast food for my sister as it is all that she eats.",

        "text": "Yesterday after work I went to my local mall to hit up a few video game stores to add to my collection. If only, if only, I'd skipped the first one I came to, but the brightly colored signs and sale racks drew me in. Things start off well right off the bat. (I'll be Me, Idiotic Manager will be IM). \n\nIM: Hi there, can I help you? \n\nMe: No thanks, just browsing for some games. \n\nIM: Do you know what type of games your boyfriend likes? \n\nMe: *thinking this is some weird ass survey they are taking* Uh, yes but I'm not buying for him today, just me. \n\nIM: *looks me up and down and walks away without a word*\n\nWell, alrighty then. Weird, slightly sexist, but whatever. I proceed to the clearance and used games and start looking through them. This store displays their games in shelves that go from about 6ft high to floor level. I'm in a crouch on the floor looking at the lowest level of games when I hear a voice 10ft to my left shouting in a loud voice. \n\nIM: DO YOU HAVE A GUN?! \n\nMe: *dropped to my knees and crouched lower to the floor with my head ducked*\n\nI look around and see people all over the store ducking behind shelves or straight up running out of the store, dropping items behind them. There are only two people upright now, IM and another worker on the other side of the store looking horrified. \n\nHe is holding a price scanner (gun) and staring at IM like she's lost her damn mind. She, meanwhile, is completely oblivious to what she has caused, and has begun yelling that the people who ran out are clearly shoplifting. Now she's run to the door and is yelling after them to come back, which only causes them to sprint faster, thinking the gunman is chasing them. I've finally gathered enough information about the ridiculous situation to angrily stand up and begin to leave, joined by many other people. \n\nWhile leaving, the man in front of me, who had been on the floor near me during the incident, (BT for Batman Tee) tells IM that she needs to think about her words more clearly and someone could have gotten seriously hurt. She apologizes and says she'll consider her words carefully from now on. Yeah, right! Nope, instead we get \n\nIM: What is this?! Some kind of cover for shoplifters?! Why are you all leaving together?! Empty your pockets! \n\nShe started grabbing people's shopping bags and trying to look through them, including a tiny Disney purse held by a 6 year old little girl. BT calmly collects all the bags back from her and redistributes them before placing his arms out like a traffic cop and instructing everyone else to leave and her to stay put. \n\nWhen the last person (Me) had exited, he stepped out of the shop, closed the door behind him, and held it shut so she couldn't follow. He then got out his cell phone and called the district manager's number, which was listed on the glass. Left a message explaining that it would be \"advantageous to review the security footage from _________ mall's store and feel free to call [him] back to have the audio added if the cameras didn't record it.\" \n\nI thanked him and continued on to the other store. She didn't follow as he sat on the bench outside glaring until she went into the back room. He truly was the hero we needed.",

        "text": "Welcome back lords and ladies and let me continue to spin you a tale.  A tale of our reluctant heroine who only wanted to buy some pants to impress a five year old.  (See earlier story for more context  OPP not that easy).  Having driven off thieves and misguided clerks I have managed to find a place in line.  Unfortunately, once again to my shortsightedness I realize that Sunday night at the megastore is not the time to shop. Oh well, I'm here now and there is no way I'm leaving without these pants!\n\n\nAfter a long and arduous wait (seriously around 30 minutes). I finally make it to the check stand. There is a trainee cashier and her trainer at the helm. I make eye contact and smile. Mostly because I have been brooding the entire time about my pants ordeal i probably looked like I was ready to commit murder at the slightest provocation. I didn't want them to think I was angry at them about the wait so I smiled serenely and began placing my purchases on the conveyor belt. Suddenly from out of the blue there comes a banshee scream that shakes us to our roots. \n\nThe wailing sounds as if an entire cave full of bats with microphones strapped to them were suddenly exposed to a lady gaga show in full swing.  (It was loud). Sensing that there must surely be a crazy gunman on the loose the cashiers and I drop down and look around for the danger. What met my eyes and ears will be forever burned into my memory. \n\nStanding just behind the lady behind me is what I can barely describe as a woman. She had to be at least 550lbs if she was an ounce.  Honestly I marveled at the feat that she was standing on her own willpower as she leaned heavily over a cart filled to the brim with potato chips, soda pop, and every junk food imaginable. Around her orbited five dirty and very hefty children ranging in age and cleanliness. She herself was dressed in a tweety bird shirt that was holding on for dear life and cut off sweat pants that ended shortly before her crock knockoffs that were almost obscured by her ankle fat. To finish off the ensemble she wore her hair in a makeshift mullet with the sides gelled down to prevent flyaways in the unimaginable circumstances where she would break off in a jog. \n\nNow being a bigger girl myself I don't discriminate but this lady was the prime example of every joke made about the megastore.  After her initial banshee cry she proceeds to start screaming in a volume and pitch that I can only imagine is used in a trailer park during a tornado.  She is yelling at her children for losing one of the other children who suddenly pops up from behind her where apparently she has been the entire time but the woman is too absorbed in screaming to notice.  The woman who had been behind me working as a buffer between me and this jerry springer episode grabs her kid and hightailed it for another checkout not caring that she will have to begin her wait over. Finding that there is no immediate danger I continue with my purchase making eye contact with the cashiers again who raise their eyebrows and cringe at a particularly high note. \n\nSuddenly I feel a jab in my side and hear someone say \"move it\". Turning I see the oldest of the orbiting children beside me with an air rifle in his hands he turns to the cashiers and says \"scan this now and I want it right back\". As I have yet to finish unloading my cart I turn to him and say \"excuse you?\"  He looks me right in the eye and says \"move it lady I didn't stutter\". At this point my f*cks meter has finally hit zero as the rage inside me that has slowly been boiling reaches the surface. I calmly say \"I'm sorry I didn't understand you because I don't know the language of rude little boys\". Having served my pot shot I turned around and suddenly I hear the boy go \"MOOOMMMM!  This lady was rude to me!!\"  \n\n\nThe woman began to puff up like a balloon and just before she was about to let loose what I am sure was to be a sweet colloquy of impassioned verbose. I turn and staring her down like a rabid dog spit out through grinding teeth with a look I am sure would send the most seasoned of generals to hide under their beds. \"Don't. Even. Think. About yelling at me like you are at your hellspawn.  Obviously, you fail to grasp this situation so let me educate you.  You are going to shut the hell up and get this child away from me. You will not say a word until I leave.  I dare you to speak to me you will NOT like the consequences!\"  Now I like to think I didn't look like a raving lunatic.  But hey you have to do what you have to do. I stared her down until she broke eye contact and deflated before my eyes.  She quietly called her child over to her and when he did not immediately move she grabbed his arm and pulled him away.  I finished my transaction and smiled politely to the cashiers and wished them a very happy Valentine's Day.  I then walked out of the store victorious WITH my pants. \n\nToo Damn long didn't read:  I can only take so much before I snap.  ",

Here is a transcript from my recent email dialogue in a Nutshell.  \n\n&gt; Me: Wednesday 10:00am \"Hello, I'm having a problem with trying to get [exact Product description] to work with [exact description of problem].  I've tried the work around suggested on these two websites [lists them and the steps taken to solve problem].  \nBoth fixes are found on your website.  They did not work.  Your website mentions a 3rd option but the link to the solution no longer works [lists page with the link AND the link it's supposed to go to]\n[Provides 5 screenshots of problem, windows 7 desktop, broken website links and issue specifically of what's happening]\"  \n\n&gt; TechSupport: Wednesday 11:45am \"Hello Draidr, What version of [Product] and version Windows are you using?  \nAlso,  Mac or PC?\"  \n\nI was a bit perplexed as the screenshots clearly show Windows 7 and the product version on the desktop icon. But maybe he needs specifics.\n\n&gt; Me: Wednesday 12:05pm \"I'm using [Product Version, Latest update] and I'm on Windows 7.  See previous Screenshots. Take note of Screenshot 3 where the feature I need is grayed out.\"  \n\n&gt; TechSupport:  Thursday 8:00am \"Have you gone to our website [He provides the very Link I listed in my original email that has the broken link].  It lists the step by step instructions.  Let me know when you've done it.\"  \n\n&gt; Me: Thursday 8:20am \"Umm, I've already done that. Again, see original Email that talks about the steps I have taken AND my request to provide me with the 3rd option that has a Dead Link.  What I'm asking for is the following [Exact Description repeated only with further details.  Each Bullet pointed for an easier read].\"  \n\nNote: I made the calculated mistake of thinking I was speaking to someone who can comprehend what I was doing.  In my steps above, I mentioned I attempted these fixes on MULTIPLE COMPUTERS here at my office.  \n\n&gt; TechSupport: Thursday 10:35am \"You stated you're using multiple computers. So the problem happens on each computer?  You will need to create a Problem ticket for each occurrence so we can further assist you.\"  \n\n&gt; Me: Thursday 11:10am \"What? No.  Look this is ONE PROBLEM. I need the solution/workaround/3rd option that you mention on your website but don't have a working link for.  Can you provide me this information or not.\"  \n\nI honestly did a facepalm after replying.  At this point, I figured I was dealing with a newbie following a Tech Support script. If I didn't hit his scripted bullet points he used to walk through the issue, he had to ask follow up questions. Poor guy was just following orders to the letter.  \n\n&gt; TechSupport: Thursday 3:07pm \"Please provide us with the Error Log found in [Location on computer].  We will also need further data from the Error logs of each computer the error is happening on.\"  \n\n**Two handed facepalm**  \nSo much for giving him the benefit of the doubt.  This guy was clearly an idiot. \n\n&gt; Me: Thursday 3:22pm \"What Error?  There is no error.  This is a functionality issue.  The error log you want is a BLANK TEXT FILE.  0 Bytes.  Again, PLEASE PROVIDE ME with the solution to this Functionality issue.  Stop following your Help Desk script for a moment and comprehend what I'm asking.  I've gone through all the Steps, I've done an extensive search that pinpoints what the problem is but the SOLUTION is on your website. Said website has a DEAD LINK to that solution.  Provide me that details of what that Dead Link has so I can attempt the fix.\"  \n\n&gt; TechSupport: Friday 7:50am \"I am unfamiliar with this problem,  I have put this case back in the Que.  Please go to [The idiot actually provides me with VERY SAME Link he provided earlier] and review the notes for the 3rd Option work around.  I've request for [Senior TechSupport Supervisor] to review your case.\"  \n\nI internally reply.. \"UUUUUHH DUUUUUUUUHHHHH\"  No $&amp;#@ you're unfamiliar with this problem...  I carefully word my next email to the Supervisor.  \n\n&gt; Me: Friday 9:00am \"URGENT  \nHello, I'm still having Functionality with [Specific detailed description of problem]. Can you please get back to me ASAP so I can apply the fix to my computer.  I need to have access to the greyed out area specified in Screenshot 3.  Thank you.\"  \n\n&gt; TechSupportSupervisor: Friday 11:50am \"Hello Draidr, Can you please provide us with [Installation log] found on [location path for Windows 32 bit computers and I'm using 64 bit].\"  \n\nI send him back the installation log for the 64 bit path.  \n\n&gt; Me: Friday *12:55pm \"Attached is the log.  Please note that I have the 64 bit version of Windows 7.\"  \n\n&gt; TechSupportSupervisor: Friday 1:07pm [Note the reply time] \"Our records show that you have the license for the 32 Bit version of our product, not the 64 Bit version.  Please contact our Sales division for a product license upgrade so you can use the correct version of our product [explain in further detail of how we are using their product incorrectly, blah blah blah].  \n\nIf I could do a triple facepalm at this point I would have.  \n\n&gt; Me: Friday 1:50pm \"Check. Your. Records. Again. We have the MULTI-LICENSE Package contract which includes BOTH versions of Windows 32bit and 64 bit to accommodate our office needs. I know this because I'm the one that has read our contract again just now.  \nI love how fast you replied when its something you wish to blame your client for.  Took you 12 minutes... yet it took you nearly 3 hours to get you to reply to my case this morning.  \nHows this for customer service, PROVIDE ME WITH THE INFORMATION I NEED.  Why does it take 2 days to give me a copy/paste solution to my problem because your website link IS DEAD.\"  \n\n&gt; TechSupportSupervisor: Friday 3:00pm \"Our records do not show you have the correct license for [Product Version]. Please fax your contract to [###-###-####] Attention TechSupportSupervisor. \n\nAt this point, I so wanted to fax them a giant photocopy of my middle finger along with the contract but I chose the professional approach.  \n\n&gt; Me: Friday 3:25pm \"As this is 2016, How about I email it to you.  See attachment. I've even used Photoshop in 2 separate JPG attachments that show you the areas in our contract that specifically mention 32 bit and 64 bit Windows.\"  \n\n&gt; TechSupportSupervisor: Monday 8:00am \"Our records have been updated. We will research your problem and reply back to you soon.\"  \n\nLadies and Gentlemen... I present to you how NOT to run your Tech Support division.  \n\nTL:DR \"Harassed by repeated displays of incompetence by our software providers Tech Support.\"\n\n*Edit: Updates in the comments below*",

        "text": "This happened eons ago, when I was a Junior in High School. It was just after Junior Prom, and rather than go to an after party, my date took me with her friends to a local 24h diner, the locally owned kind, that *might* have a second location. I didn't know any of the other people in the group, though the one girl was on my bus.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nEverything was going well, we all shared a booth (I think there was maybe six of us in total, it was a large booth), until we got our entrees. That girl apparently did not like her omelette. She said it tasted like soap. So, she told the waitress that she wanted a refund on it, or her to bring out another entree for free. The waitress refused, stating that's not their policy. Cue a long, loud argument with this girl raising her voice about how *she* works at Chain Restaurant, and whatever the customer wants there goes. Waitress calmly replies, they are *not* Chain Restaurant, and if she wanted a new entree, she'd have to pay for it. Now, I should clarify, there was nothing visually wrong with the omelette. She just didn't like the taste.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nEventually this goes on so long, and so loudly, that I excuse myself (I only had a drink anyway), to step outside and get away from the stressful environment because I have anxiety issues and was being triggered into a bad panic attack by this. My date was concerned, but let me go. At this point, everyone else at the table is telling her to drop it, because she's being a bitch. Outside, I paced around, trying to come down from my panic attack when... she comes outside. No words are spoken, though she's glaring at me, and possibly everything else. After which, I scuttled back inside, where everything was normal again, and we spoke not of what happened. She never came back inside, so I assume she got her parents to come pick her up or something. Her poor date was quite mortified.",

        "text": "This happened a couple of years ago, but it stuck with me and I wanted to memorialize it in some way.\n\nI got off of work late one night, around 9 or 10PM. It had been a rough stretch at work - as head of a large department in corporate America, I didn't get days off, and 12-14 hours a day in the office were the norm. I was also having serious relationship problems, as well as going through a major change in my living situation. I was about at the end of my rope with regard to my stress level.\n\nI stopped to get gas on the way home, and popped into the mini-mart attached to the gas station to pick up a couple of things. The cashier (who I'd never seen before) greeted me as I entered:\n\n\"Hi, how's it going?\"\n\nI absent-mindedly said hello and mumbled something about the day being almost over. My face must have given away my true answer, that I felt this was the worst day of my life and, at that moment, I couldn't see how things were ever going to be better.\n\n\"That bad, huh?\" she replied. I shrugged and proceeded to grab my items and approached the register. She rung me up and told me the total. With my mind still at work, I grabbed some loose bills from my pocket and haphazardly shoved them onto the counter.\n\nShe looked at me with borderline disgust. \n\n\"Hey, I know you're not happy with your life right now, but do you have to make mine worse too?\"\n\nI stared at her in shock and confusion. She looked from me to the money I had left wadded on the counter, then back to me. Realizing my faux pas and embarrassed, I apologized and started straightening the bills. She interrupted me:\n\n\"Hey! I'm *fucking* with you!\"\n\nOnce again caught off-guard by this cashier who had stepped so far out of her expected behavior to be real with me, I started laughing. She joined in, and once the moment subsided, she smiled broadly and said:\n\n\"Made ya smile!\"\n\nI thanked her and left, still somewhat embarrassed at letting my face and demeanor betray my true mental state. As I drove home, I continued the smile she had left me with and vowed to be in a better mood at least for the rest of that night.\n\nHer simple action of noticing the weight I was carrying on my shoulders and going out of her way to cheer me up reminded me that human compassion really does still exist, and that we can find it in the least expected places. That we can make a difference in the lives of strangers through our actions during simple, short encounters is a philosophy that I try to carry with me, but this experience served as a needed reminder. \n\nHopefully someone who reads this is a retail/service employee. Know that you have my thanks and appreciation for all of the daily encounters you handle with grace and a smile. Given some of the challenging situations you have to deal with as part of your daily work, your ability to rise above and do your job with friendliness can help, cheer, and even inspire others.",

        "text": "Hello TFC. Tonight I broke my cardinal rule and went shopping at the megastore in the city next to mine.  I don't have a problem with the megastore per say but it does attract a certain level of people.  This in itself is a small deterrent but I have found in the nearby town (which everyone wants to get the hell out of) it attracts an even lower class of people which leads me to avoid it at all cost.  Of course if I had listened to my own wisdom I wouldn't be writing this story and you wouldn't have entertainment so let's celebrate my folly with these wonderful tales that will hopefully teach me my lesson (though to be honest we know the crazy will find me no matter where I go).  \n\nI should have taken the hint when I almost got ran over three times walking in the pedestrian crossing on the way into the store.  However, not to be thwarted I made my way through the doors in search of some new workout attire as the little girl at the gym last week informed me I always wear the same outfit. Being style shamed by a five year old is a new low for me. So in order to regain my dignity I proceeded to the athletic wear department.  After perusing the wares I set sights on a really nice pair of ombré pants. My heart fluttered as I found a clearance sticker attached. Oh the joy not only would I have a new kick ass outfit but I could save money as well my mind raced as I thought about the things I could purchase with my windfall. Okay not really but hey who complains about saving money. So having found the pants I set my sights on finding a shirt to complete my outfit.  As I rummaged through the infant sized tank tops in search of something appropriate for a adult I hear someone behind me.  I turn to find a large Spanish lady digging through my cart and holding up my newly found pants.  I called out politely that those were mine.  She turned to me and responded. \"No habla English\".  \n\nThis pants theft was not about to go down on my watch so I responded in Spanish \"those are mine please give them back\".  Stunned to find she could not escape with my item due to language barriers she reluctantly returned my pants and scurried off in search of other items to pilfer. Ok I don't know that for sure but it sounds good.  So I continue my mission of restoring my fashion prowess. I head to the menswear section as they carry shorts that extend past my butt cheeks. As I continue to hunt for my new wardrobe I step away from my cart to look at a pair of board shorts when out of the corner of my eye who do I see reaching into my cart again but \"the pants thief\" or OPP (other people's pants) lady.  Annoyed now I yell \"What are you doing?!\"  Stunned and looking like a deer in the headlights she stammers out that she thought I had put them back and they were available now.  Wait, ok, first now you speak perfect English and in my cart is the same as putting them back on the rack?  I shoo her away like an annoying pigeon and move on to the dressing room so that I can try on these pants that are so amazing that it would cause someone to try and pilfer them not once but twice. \n\nIn the dressing room I do conclude that they are indeed wonderful and I must purchase them to show that little girl who is fashionable challenged. Okay maybe I'm taking it a little too hard but when you get called out by a kid wearing a pink Dora tee shirt and orange leggings it's a little hard to swallow. I redress in my own attire and exit the dressing room to find (yes you guessed it). OPP going through my cart AGAIN!  I'm furious at this point.  How dare she touch my clementines and sports socks in her quest to steal my pants.  I yell at her that if she doesn't leave immediately I was calling security. She scadadled (hey I tried spelling it give me a break). I then turned around to find the dressing room lady taking things out of my cart and hanging them up in the return rack. I proceeded to take them back and put them in my cart when she turned back to her work table. She then took hold of my cart and in broken English told me she would be happy to put the clothes away and I didn't need too.  ARRGGHHH!  Is the entire planet aligned to keep me from buying these pants?  Seriously, what is going on?!  \n\nManaging to finally convey that I did not actually need help putting the things I've been waging war to buy I proceeded to the check out stands.  There I began my half hour wait and what will be known as the final showdown in my next segment of the shopping trip through the bowels of hades.  \n\nEdit:  TL;DR Swiper no swiping!!  Or how the universe is against me wearing pants. ",

It turns out, to no surprise, that the THEY do not provide green tea as an option.\n\nBut this is not where the story ends. This is where it begins.\n\n“Yes ma’am, let me see what I can do. We don’t have green tea, but I might. Let me check my carry-on bag I packed.”\n\nShe offered a solution to make the passenger happy, regardless of what THEY had. She didn’t offer a corporate solution, the status quo. She offers a human solution.\n\nAfter retrieving her bag, and digging through a couple of different compartments, she finds a few packets of green tea and proceeds to steep it for the passenger.\n\nGoing the extra mile is a choice, or maybe it’s not a choice, maybe it’s in her DNA.\n\nShe could have said no. I probably would. There are no tips. I would never see the passenger again. There is absolutely nothing in it for me. The only one that wins is the airline that will probably lay me off after the next big merger.\n\nBut yet, deep down, I know that would have been the right thing to do. And perhaps we can train ourselves and our employees to be more like Shelley. A little bit more human. Reaching into our own bags and offering a hot cup of green tea. Even if THEY only offer black.\n\n",

They said they would hold it until I called for it. Today I called to have it filled and they can't find the script. How do you lose an e-script anyway? The pharmacy tech says they have no record of receiving anything and 'maybe they called me in error last time'. Really? That's a hugely coincidental error. She says I need to call the doctors office and have them send a new one. The doctors office is closed on Fridays, so now I have to wait until Monday. I'm just thankful I didn't wait until the last minute because it's a 'take everyday or else' med. ",

I just recently moved a few blocks, and this one was closer to my new house than the location I usually frequent, so I do not think I ever stopped at this particular location before. \n\nAs I walked in, an employee greeted me as per usual and I made my way around the store in search of the ATM because I did not know where it was and each location is different. I realized that the ATM was located within a small alcove to the left of the main entrance. Strangely, an old man wearing a plain black hat that said, \"security\" was sitting on a stool or something next to the counter and close to the ATM. This chain does not usually have security guards, by the way.\n\nAs I walked past him, he gave me an odd look and I said, \"I was just looking for the ATM.\" As I turned to use the ATM, he did not face me, but started mumbling, \"Weren't you in here the other night? I think I saw you in here the other night with two guys.\" I did not really pay attention at first, but I said something back like, \"I don't think I was in here the other night.\" \n\nThis is where it got really strange. The man suddenly yelled to the employees, \"Wasn't she the one who came in the other night and clogged the toilet up?\" The employee who greeted me told him \"no,\" but the \"security\" man continued, getting the attention of the other employee, an older woman. \"She was the one who came in here the other night and clogged up the toilet with brown paper towels!\" This chain of convenience stores does not even usually have public restrooms.\n\nI was getting ready to leave, and I said to the man, \"I don't think I've even been here before, that was not me.\" \n\nThe older female employee then came to the counter and started to yell at me, \"I don't care where you have been. Why would you do that?!\" I said back to her, \"I have never been here before!,\" and left.\n\nIt did not bother me at the time, but the odd way they treated me has been bugging me the more I think about it today. I would never even ask to use the bathroom there, much less clog the place up and then have the nerve to come back. ",

The cashier kept trying to get the officers attention, but the officer just stared at the lady like she was crazy, and didn't do anything. \n\nThe lady threatened to check the security cameras and to count the condoms.

        "text": "So this happened a few years ago. I was at a chain restaurant with a friend in the summer. The restaurant had a small outdoor area you could eat at; it was a small area with a tall wooden fence around it; it was in the parking lot, so this meant you didn't have to look at cars while you sat and ate, which was nice. We decided to sit outside, and so were led to our seat and told someone would be back to take our orders. They went back inside.\nAfter deciding on our orders and waiting a while, nobody was coming back. We waited for what must have been 15-20 minutes (possibly more, we weren't keeping track of time from the start), and still nobody. Getting a bit frustrated, we decided to go inside to ask if somebody was coming to take our order (we didn't even have a glass of water yet).\n\nWe get up and walk over to the door to find that it's locked, and we can't get back in the building. Obviously we're very surprised to find that we are locked out. We go back and sit for a few moments longer. Then I remember that there is a door in the fence leading to the parking lot, so we go out that door, and enter through the main entrance.\n\nWe walk up to the hostess. I'm irritated, but I'm speaking in a very polite voice and trying to be as nice as possible. I realize they probably forgot about us because we were the only ones outside. I don't remember the exact words, but essentially I explained to her that we had been sitting outside for at least 20 minutes, we had been locked out, we assumed we had been forgotten about, and we would like to order. She was incredibly snotty, seemingly offended at the idea that someone could forget about us, and very insistent that we should go back and sit and someone would come to take our orders. \n\nserver is walking by, and she talks to him for a moment. We can't quite hear her, but assume she's telling him about the terrible people outside he'll have to deal with. But then, he tells her that he totally forgot about us. She doesn't even look at us, and just walks away to do something else, I guess. He comes over, apologizing profusely, and takes our orders there. We go back out to our seats to wait.\n\nHe comes out with our food and apologizes again. We tell him it's fine. He says he'll be back soon with refills. He tries to leave; of course, the door is still locked, so he goes through the fence and the main door to get back in.\nWe finish our meal, and he finally returns with our water refills. Again he apologizes, as he notices we've already finished our meals, and awkwardly places our water on the table. By this point someone had actually unlocked the door, and so he went back inside the normal way.\n\nI felt bad for the guy, he seemed very nice and was incredibly apologetic. We still tipped him. But I'm still amazed at the behaviour of the hostess, and kind of surprised that we weren't offered at least a slight discount for being forgotten about for 20+ minutes and locking us out of the restaurant.",

        "text": "So I'm still reeling from this last night. \n\n\nMy boyfriend and I went out to a restaurant last night, the type of place where girls dress in skimpy clothing (not the chain you're thinking of it's a knockoff of it) for a few beers to celebrate me getting a new job. If you're wondering why we would go to a place like that, we'll I'm Bi and he's straight so it's the perfect place for us. We never hit on the waitresses or anything, we just enjoy being there for obvious reasons. \n\n\n\nSo I go and sit down, my boyfriend goes to the bathroom. I sit there for an unusually long time, when suddenly my boyfriend comes over to the table and tells me to get up, we're leaving. He's walking really fast. As we wall out the door I see the manager standing there and my boyfriend says angrily \"Sorry, misunderstanding\" \n\n\n\nWe get out to the parking lot and I say \"What is going on?\" \n\nBoyfriend: \"They said I'm not welcome back because I tried to solicit sex from someone\" \n\n\nMe: \"WHAT???\"\n\n\nSide note: My boyfriend wouldn't cheat on me, let alone try to solicit sex. He's never given me any reason to be suspicious  and we've been together happily for 3 years. This accusation blew my mind as much as it did his. He definitely wasn't lying. He did not try to do this and they probably mistook him from someone else. \n\n\nBoyfriend:\" I told him that's ridiculous and you have the wrong person. He said I'm not welcome back or he would call the cops\"\n\n\nMe: \"Please just let me go back in there and talk to him. Let me stand up for you this is ridiculous\" \n\n\n\nMy boyfriend didn't want me to go back in there, I'll admit I was flying in a rage (I get that way if someone insults or hurts someone I love)  so I mentioned calling them and he said he wasn't sure how much good it would do. \n\n\n\nWhat do I do? Do I call the restaurant? We like going there, and it's the only restaurant of its type for many miles around. We've frequented it before with zero problems. Help! \n\n\nEdit: a word got autocorrected \n\n\nUPDATE: \n\nWell I called said restaurant today, happened to be the same manager who answered the phone. And I asked him a bunch of questions like do you really think it was him blah blah. So apparently one of the waitresses saw him come in and told the manager that my Bf touched her/solicited her or something and that it was definitely him. I asked the manager when this incident occurred but he wouldn't give me a straight answer, only that they didn't tolerate that kind of behavior. I asked him if my bf was alone when it happened, he said yes. This is VERY unusual because my bf and I always come here together, and we also live together and we spend most nights in the house playing video games; there's never been any suspicious \"where are you honey\" moments \n\n\nI saw the waitress that accused him. We've never spoken to her in our life. So now I'm even more confused I guess, but I really think she confused him with someone else since she only saw him from a distance across the restaurant. \n\n\nEdit2: clarification of some details \n\n\nEdit3: More clarification: The supposed solicitation did NOT happen the night we were there. I was sitting at a table at the time and the one waitress that was there never went anywhere near the bathrooms. When I called the manager the next day to ask when the event happened he never gave me a straight answer. ",

        "text": "I went to a grocery store to pick up an inhaler from the pharmacy and the entrance of this particular store is on the opposite side of the store from the pharmacy, so I decide to pick up a few items along the way that catch my attention. Mostly just a frozen pizza and freshly made sushi that the store offers in the deli section as well as a bottle of Gatorade. \n\nWith my few items in hand, I make my way around to the pharmacy. At this point, I've made a talent of balancing items when I'm not getting enough to warrant a push cart. With these few items precariously balanced in my hands, I'm not really in a rush, but I could see where someone might think so.\n\nI made it up to the counter of the pharmacy and I see an older man with a kid in tow. The poor kid is trying his best not to look embarrassed because his grandpa, or whoever he is, is talking very loudly on the phone.\n\n&gt; OM: What type of insurance did you say we had? I think it's a type D or something.\n\nAnd so he and his wife are having a long drawn out conversation in the only open line, arguing back and forth about what kind of insurance they had. They also started talking about her taking a picture of the insurance and the woman not having enough battery left on her phone to send a picture of their insurance card.\n\nAgain, I'm not in a rush, but I do start getting impatient and I guess it showed on my face because one of the pharmacy technicians came over quickly and opened the second lane. By that time, there was a woman heading over to pick up her medication, too, so I don't feel too special with her stopping the packaging of medicine to help me out.\n\nAbout this time, I hear one of the pharmacists speak up, somehow managing to get a word in edgewise, saying something about how the particular item wasn't covered by insurance or something and I try and keep a straight face as I'm moving over to the other lane because by this time, the guy has his wife on speaker phone for...whatever reason.\n\nSo at the new line, the technician is making small talk and I now feel bad because I wasn't feeling well and kind of mumbling my way through it.\n\nAt one point, the older male says something loud and we both turn our attention to him very briefly and then when we look at each other again, we both try and hide a quick laugh at the guy and then she mouths something about not liking when the customers use speaker phones. Can't say I blame her.\n\n\nAnyway...sorry. It's probably not a very interesting story, but it made my night. I know had she not opened that second lane for the technologically impaired, I would've been stuck there another ten minutes, so it did mean a  lot to me. ",

LS wants new boots, Mom's buying them as present for doing very well on her math test (Mom is very cheap so this is kinda a big deal for LS). Keep in mind that I wasn't actually there, I was across the mall with Dad.\n\nAnyways, M and LS walk into this somewhat fancier shoe shop, won't give the name out. Still, it's not uber fancy, just a bit more upscale. Tons of shops like it around.\n\nLS is getting to the age where her foot size changes every 6 months, so M doesn't know her current size. They walked into the store, LS found a really nice pair of boots she really liked. This is how the convo went between M and the cashier (which we'll call C).\n\nM: Hello, my daughter wants these boots, but I don't know her size. Do you have foot measurer we could use?\n\nC: (incredibly bitchy tone) No. This is a speciality footwear store, not Payless.\n\nM: What? You're a shoe store, why wouldn't you have a foot measurer? Her foot's changed since we last bought her shoes.\n\nC: (same bitchy tone) Well we don't have anything to measure feet with. We expect our clientele to know their foot size before they come in. If you want your foot measured, go somewhere else.\n\nM is very good at restraint, and LS really loved these boots. So M decided whatever, we'll still get the boots. LS tried several different sizes until M found one that fits. M brought them to the counter, giving her \"death glare\" (how us kids knew were in serious shit), paid for them. As she was walking out, she said (quite loudly, apparently) to my little sister \"That is a prime example of how you don't treat customers.\"\n\nI *still* don't understand how you could be a specialty shoe store and not have a foot measurer. If anything, you should have *tons* of measuring tools, to ensure the shoes your customer's buying are the correct size and fit.",

        "text": "I had a positive experience at my local public library today that looked like it was going to be much different going in, but a good attitude on both my end and the librarian's side allowed for a positive outcome.\n\nA little backstory - I last used my library card at the local library about a decade ago (before I left for college in a different part of the state, and subsequently worked elsewhere before coming back about a year ago.) When I left for college, I had no need to carry my card with me, so I left it among the items I kept at home.\n\nI attempted initially to get a new card issued via their online internet form, but was sent a very non-descript e-mail stating that I couldn't be issued a new card and I would need to visit a branch to discuss my patron account. I thought that maybe I had a small balance of fines and needed to address that before getting a new card, maybe a few dollars that were left on the card from before I went to college. Or, maybe since I hadn't been there in years, I needed to reactivate my account, or something like that.\n\nI arrived at the branch and found a staffer who wasn't otherwise engaged and asked them if they could take a look at my account to see what was the issue with my record that was keeping a new card from being issued - next thing I knew, a page at least 3 feet long was printing from their receipt printer with a log of items I apparently owed fines on - almost $300. Surely I hadn't forgotten to return something before I went to college? I then started to wonder if I had ever borrowed that much from the library in the whole time I was in high school. The librarian did appear to take a stance and give me a look that was somewhat condemning (I'm sure seeing this as a librarian is like a police officer looking at a career criminal's rap sheet.) She was very professional in tone, however, and explained that any fines on my account needed to be settled before I could borrow anything else.\n\nThe receipt did show details of the items that were fined, and sure enough, there were a number of items that were marked as lost/replaced by the library (never returned) including a good number of CDs, a few books, and a couple issues of Cat Fancy (?).\n\nI asked the librarian if they could tell me when the fines were accrued, and she advised all but about $5 were accrued in 2006/07, when I was away at college. I started connecting the dots and figuring that someone in my household probably used my card after I left for school. I told the librarian I suspected this, but it was made clear that the only way a new card could be issued is if the account was cleared.\n\nBecause I have some sort of lawful moral compass, I didn't get upset about this development (outwardly anyway - it wasn't the librarian's fault, and I wasn't going to take it out on her,) but instead I told the librarian that I was more than willing to pay the fine to clear the account (it was my fault for not keeping possession of the card, after all.) At that point, the clerk paused, the somewhat condemning look on her face cleared, and she looked at the screen on her PC for a few seconds. The clerk then looked up and told me \"well, how about we call it $20 and we'll clear this all out?\" Before I could pass any thought on what was happening, I had my debit card in hand and let it be charged for the $20 compromise amount.\n\nI was then able to get a new card (with a new number, so any other cards out there will no longer work, just in case) and, in a couple days once everything clears from the database, I can start borrowing from the library again.\n\nAll in all, a happy experience that ended up working out well on my end.",

        "text": "Hello! So, this happened last month, but it's still really memorable to me. Here's some history first: I had one of those really slow leaky tires that never seemed to want to hold air for more than a couple months at a time. This fall/winter was when it just kept losing air, despite how much air I put in to it that I think it was giving up on me. \n\nBasically, my neighbor next door to me noticed that my tire was completely flat and texted me about it. I thanked her and let her know that I would handle it by the morning. \n\nMorning rolls around and I decide to call up a nationally known company that helps fixes your cars for you/replaces your battery/generally provide you with fixes for your car. I asked them to refill my tire so that I could drive on it later. Anyway, they dispatch a local tow guy who comes relatively quickly despite the forty-five minute window they gave me. I greet him and thank him for coming out. He first tries to put air in my tire, but it doesn't want to inflate. So, he offers to try to get the tire off and put my donut on. However, the last time I had my tire replaced, apparently the lug nuts were screwed on too tightly and it didn't want to come off (it broke the cheap metal one I had that folded over, not the cross one), so with our options exhausted, he offered to keep trying. I'm thinking at this point that I'm going to have to get the car in the shop to get a new tire on it since I can't drive on a flat (I have aluminum rims instead of steel ones, so they're more expensive to replace.) After he tries again to unscrew my lug nuts, he offers the option to follow me to a local repair shop of my choosing so that he'd be able to keep an eye on my tire while I drive so that I don't cause any damage to my rim. I take him up on this offer since I don't want to be worried more than I am about this. \n\nSo, we get there in like, five minutes and I'm greeted by the manager of the auto repair shop when I get out of my car. I make sure to thank the tow truck guy for doing what he did because I definitely didn't expect it. The manager checks my car, and sure enough, my tire is completely flat. I go in with him, fill out a bit of paperwork. Apparently, this was the best time to do it since there weren't many other customers waiting in there. The manager walks up to me, offering me coffee and I politely decline and the entire time I waited for my car to get worked on/finished, he and I strike up conversation about a variety of topics and with this, it didn't seem like I had to wait that long! He was really friendly and made me feel like I was valued. I left the mechanic as a very happy customer. \n\nWhen I got back home, I decided to leave good words with higher ups at both companies to let them know about the stellar customer service I received and they were more than happy to hear it. \n\nAnyway, my new tire is now problem-free and I'm a very happy driver again, ready for my inspection next month!

So, I look around the store not really seeing anything I like. When an Employee comes over and the exchange happens. E= Employee. Me=Me\n\nE: Can I help you with anything? \n\nMe: No, I'm good just looking.\n\nE: I think you want some jeans, don't you. \n\nMe: No, actually I don't like jeans.\n\nE: Well you will love these jeans. \n\nHe goes off to the jean area and comes back with 5 pairs of jeans.\n\nE: I'll go get you a changing room. \n\nHe went one way and I went out the door. My friend came out after, wondering what the heck just happen. \n\nI never went there again and the store was later replaced.\n\nEdit: This was 6 years ago. Just to tell everyone",

        "text": "Yesterday, on my way home, I needed to stop at the grocery store to pick up a box of pasta. My fella and I are both at the end of our paychecks, and we were starving, so I was just trying to grab something cheap and easy to make. \n\nI turn into the pasta aisle and find a woman with two carts, blocking all of the pasta shelves. I say \"excuse me.\" She doesn’t respond. She sees me. It's clear what I'm trying to do, but she avoids eye contact and just continues to stand there. \n\nA few seconds later a man comes around the corner and stands behind the second cart and the two start conversing. Okay, the lady can't push both carts herself, but her companion is back. Now move. \n\nNope! Now they are both blatantly blocking my path. They leave their carts in front of the pasta (which is on the lower shelves, so I can't just reach over) and wander further down the aisle. \n\nFinally they come back and move their shit. I grab my box, only to find that they are now blocking the path at the other end of the aisle. Part of me wanted to just push past them. Instead I just turned around and went the long way out of the aisle. \n\nSome people are so unbelievably inconsiderate. But of course, I should have realized that they were obviously the most important people in the store.\n\n**Edit** A lot of people are asking me why I didn't just move the cart when they wandered off. I forgot to mention that their little kid was sitting in it. Great parenting, I know. But I didn't want to scare the kid by coming near him or scare the mom by moving the cart with him in it. ",

        "text": "There is this kiosk in the mall I go too that is always trying to get people to sign up for this stupid scam sweepstake where they put you up in a hotel for the night and try and sell you stuff.  Since no one fucking does it, the kiosk has been getting a lot more aggressive about approaching people.\n\nToday as I passed it, I usually just say \"I don't want it! stop asking!\" before they even get a chance to talk to me, but today I decided to just not even look at them. Well, the guy comes out from his kiosk, stands directly in front of me, and I walked around him interrupting what he was saying. He then proceeded to follow me saying stuff like \"Hey man! free stuff!\" \"Why are you in such a hurry?!\" \"You on a mission?\" I ignored him for a while but after I got close to the food court I realized this guy wasn't going to shutup. I turned and told him to fuck off or I'll call the police and he walked away. \n\nGod fucking damnit, if people don't want your shitty sweepstakes stop trying to sell it to them ",

        "text": "Mods from TFR said this would fit better here.\n\nMy wife and I went to grab some tacos and chalupas. When we got there I went to the men's room to wash my hands. Nothing out of the ordinary. \n\nWhile we are eating some delicious tacos, a family comes in with a tween boy. We are the only two groups in the restaurant. The tween goes to the men's room. After my wife and I eat, I need to use the potty. I go in, and the place is trashed. TP was everywhere and the roll was stuffed into the john.\n\nI went out and got the manager and told her what happened and explained the sequence of events. I knew it was the kid. The manager and I walk over to the men's room. I could see in my peripheral vision the kid turning white. \n\nShe looks at it and then walks over to the family and explains to the parents that their son was caught doing vandalism. She said they would not call for the police if the kid cleaned it up. The boy's mother turned a deeper red than I thought physically possible.\n\nI'd like to say that it ended with him cleaning it up and his parents lowering the boom on him, but we were done eating and it was obvious who'd said something so my wife and I quickly and quietly left.",
