I would like to become a counselor at the previously mentioned immersion camp in summer 2023, but I feel like I should work on improving my conversational skills beforehand. That is all fine and good, but the real issue comes in at the fact that this gig is in five months, and I don't know if that's enough time to drastically improve. Does anyone have any tips for quickly improving listening comprehension and speech output? Should I focus mainly on native media input learning? Should I get a language partner? \n\nTLDR; Very soon I'm applying for a job that requires me to speak in full time Japanese for around a month, but I'm shaky in my comprehension skills and need to rapidly improve.

        "text": "First of all, I cannot share it since it’s literally what you pay the book for.\n\nThe book: 「はじめての日本語能力試験 N2単語2500」\n\nThe original purpose was to make an Anki deck that fits my need. I chose this book because this series has very high quality recordings of words and sentences available on their official website, and they are already split individually into single word and sentence, perfect for flashcards.\n\nMy ideal card types are\n\n* kanji + hint -&gt; sound, meaning, sentence\n* sound + hint -&gt; kanji\n* sentence sound -&gt; sentence writing and meaning\n\n## Methods\n\nI typed into a google spreadsheet. One row per word, many columns. I found typing by column faster, so I went though each section 4 times (jp word, en meaning, jp sentence, en sentence). Exported in csv.\n\nJapanese are kanji only. I have a script that adds furigana readings to the word. It is not perfect and I have to manually correct some of them as I study the deck. One example is that it would generate `書[か]き 留[とど]める` where as the correct reading is `書[か]き 留[と]める`. The reason is that since I want to only add furigana on the kanji but not the whole word, in my script I split the word to process `書き` and `留める` separately. And the latter by itself can be read in two ways. However the error rate is very low. I would deem the script an overall success.\n\nIn the end I feed the data together with audio to another script that generate the Anki deck using [genanki](https://github.com/kerrickstaley/genanki).\n\n## My experience\n\nI've definitely learned some new words through typing the entire book, especially the ones the repeated showed up in sentences. However that's about it. The sentences in this book grammatically are extremely simple.\n\nI don't know if I would recommend this method. I've spent around 35 hours in making this. And it is only the first step towards learning them more conviniently in Anki. I do end up with some nice looking flashcards, though.\n\n## Results\n\nI’ve only made one card type for now: [front](https://i.imgur.com/w5ALPsc.jpg)/[back](https://i.imgur.com/zRO3rw0.jpg)",

Is there a good reason to stick with those \"standardized\" transcriptions as opposed to a phonetic transcription?\n\nFor example when I see Japanese people transcribe the name John it's almost always done with an オ sound like some variation of ジオン; but the way I pronounce John is closer to ジアン. They seem to be directly translating each sound character without regard to the actual sound (J&gt;ジ, O&gt;オ N&gt;ン). Is there some good reason to do it this way rather than phonetically?",

        "text": "Hi all,\n\n\nFour years ago or so I started a project that teaches Japanese without relying on translation. It introduces new words using emojis or illustrations and the uses them in some simple stories that I think of as genuinely enjoyable. Words are repeated very often so that the stories act as a natural SRS. The more one reads the more complex it all becomes.\n\nIt starts [here]( https://drdru.github.io/stories/intro.html ) and the list of stories is [here]( https://drdru.github.io/stories.html ).\n\n\nAs the title says, it has now reached 100 pages and introduces the reader to about 500 words. It is a big milestone for me so I've decided to share it again on this sub to celebrate this release.\n\nWhen I started I thought this would fill a gap in the resources available to Japanese learners. It turns out it never really took off. I personally think it's a really cool resource to have and wish this existed when I was a beginner. I am going to take a break from this project for some time to be able to focus on my other projects that aim to provide high quality content to learners who can read NHK Easy News and just enter the intermediate plateau (~N4+) :\n\n- [The Tile World Chronicles]( https://drdru.github.io/twc.html ) : a set of pixel art illustrated FF6 inspired stories\n\n- [AinoloniA: Return to Parascythe]( https://tapas.io/episode/2768428 ) : a comic book taking place in a post apocalytic world It comes with a Kanji guide [here]( https://drdru.github.io/return_to_parascythe/kanji_guide.html ) (The creator and I will make an 'official anouncement' about this project  in the coming weeks, there are still a few things we want to do). \n\n\nI hope some of this will help you improve your Japanese while having a good time. I strongly believe that with enough Graded Readers Japanese learning would be a solved problem. \n\n:-)",

Ive never played it in English, I have only a slight understanding of the plot. Definitely a lot of compound words that I’m not super familiar with.\n\nI’ve clocked 11 hours already and it’s April 19th, I don’t know if this means I’m going slower than normal play, but it takes me thirty seconds to read every two lines of dialogue.\n\nThe game is so alluring though. I can’t put it down. But I constantly float in and out of understanding. Every few conversations I don’t understand what’s being said. Particularly conversations that deal with emotions and people’s motivations. Conversations relating to past events are easier to get through.\n\nI was wondering if anyone knew the consequences of saying things incorrectly or doing incorrect things in the game. Does the storyline change if you respond this or that way in a text message?\n\nAny recommendations for having a positive experience in Japanese? I don’t want to miss anything important.\n\nAlso, if you have also played a complex video game with lots of dialogue, did you find it more worthwhile to understand everything that was happening? Or felt if it is important, it would come up again so I shouldn’t open the dictionary every five minutes?",

I don't know about you, but when I'm watching something in any language with subtitles, I don't want there to be a line in brackets telling me every time a door closes or a bird is chirping, I find it annoying. Migaku is great for removing this, but what if you aren't paying for Migaku and want a free way of doing the exact same thing? Well today I've been able to figure it out, and want to share it with y'all:    \n\n\n1: Select the subtitle file (usually an srt file) you want to remove parenthesis from, and open it with notepad   \n2: Select all the text   \n3: Paste it into any site that will run a replace operation, such as [https://coding.tools/regex-replace](https://coding.tools/regex-replace)   \n4: Run the following expression: \\[（(\\]\\[\\^）)\\\\n\\]\\*\\[）)\\]   \n5: Copy the new text and replace the old text with it   \n6: Save the file as an srt file, and rename it if you so wish   \n\n\nAnd that's that.

Of course I want to punch above my weight but after a skill assessment, the teacher there told me I would need to drastically improve my speaking if I want to have a chance to join this higher group. **What do?**\n\nCurrent stack: \n\n* Daily Anki for vocab\n* YouTube teachers for listening 1h/day\n* 2x/week 1h sessions with teacher on Italki\n* 1-2 exercises daily from the Genki workbooks to keep refreshing the grammar points learned previously\n\nI like my current Italki teacher but **I'm looking for some speaking-focused exercises or course book I can follow with her** for 2 months**.** Coto are using a book called  『Weekly J』[https://amzn.asia/d/dGDKWcP](https://www.italki.com/open?target=https%3A%2F%2Famzn.asia%2Fd%2FdGDKWcP)  which seems to be focused on speaking, I'm considering getting it and following it with the teacher.

        "text": "I figured it would be fun to do some textual analysis for Japanese learners. Particularly because the game has the original calling cards in-game (just like a lot of other items throughout the game). To avoid spoiling plot points in the title, it just contains the number and not the name of the person it is addressed to.\n\n*Calling card -* *予告状 - (Yokokujou)*: For those wondering what it is, In the game, Persona 5, these cards were sent by the Phantom Thieves to the persons they target, indicating an imminent attack on their psyche to \"change their heart\", i.e. to make them confess what they have done and change their ways. Basically the card outlines their particular crime, why they're being targeted, and informs them that the attack is coming the following day.\n\n(The Japanese word for \"calling card\" which is 予告状 (Yokokujou). Oddly enough, in the soundtrack, the lyrics of the battle song \"Take Over\" make reference to a \"prior notice card\" which is a direct translation of the word.)  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Original text:*  \n暴利を貪る強欲の大罪人。  \n奥村邦和殿。  \nお前の利益と世界的な名声は  \n従業員への非道で成り立っている。  \nゆえに我々は全ての罪を  \nお前の口から告白させることにした。  \n**心の怪盗団より。**  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \n*English (my translation, not necessarily the English translation of the game):*  \n(To) the great criminal of greed coveting massive profits,  \nMister Okumura Kunikazu.  \nYour profits and worldwide reputation  \nare built on the unjust treatment of your employees.  \nTherefore we have decided to make you confess all of your crimes from your own mouth.  \n**From the Phantom Thieves of Hearts**  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \n*Romaji:*  \nBouri wo musaboru gouyoku no daizainin,  \nOkumura Kunikazu-dono.  \nOmae no ri\\`eki to seikaiteki na meisei ha  \njugyouin he no hidou de naritatteiru.  \nyue ni ware ware ha subete no tsumi wo  \nomae no kuchi kara kokuhaku saseru koto ni shita.  \n**kokoro no kaitoudan yori**  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Notes:***\n\n奥村邦和殿:  Okumura Kunikazu-dono. Welcome back to the wonderful rabbit hole of Japanese names. I can only think of something on his first name which includes the kanji 和 (which in mathematics is the sign for \"sum\" in Japanese textbooks). Furthermore the reading \"kazu\" is like 数, meaning to count, numbers, sums,  i.e. at least sort of related to the idea of money, greed. Or to sum it up more like: he only cares about the bottom line.\n\nAgain, note the final title \"dono\" which I translated with \"Mister\" (different from Mr.). \"Dono\" is different from what the kanji, meaning \"lord\" implies. \"dono\" at the end of a name is, depending on the context, pejorative, as it implies the one addressing the other with that title is in a higher position. Like a teacher towards a student, or a superior at work vs. a junior colleague. A central theme of the game is rebellion against a world of uncaring, evil adults, therefore this inversion of teenagers addressing adults with this fits well.  \n\n\n強欲 (gouyoku): greed. note the pattern with the other calling cards\n\n強欲 (gouyoku)  +  elsewhere in the text 非道 (hidou meaning wrong, unjust): concepts that are elsewhere put together in the yonjijukugo (4-character expression) 強欲非道 (gouyokuhidou) meaning basically, so bloody greedy the person would sell his own grandmother  \n\n\nことにした (Koto ni shita): part of the \"koto ni suru\" grammatical construction, i.e. to be decided, to decide on\n\n怪盗団 (kaitoudan): The Phantom Thieves, or literally, \"ghostly thief band\". all 1 word with 3 characters.  \n\n\nより (yori): It's a special \"yori\" here, not the comparative one, used to say less than/more than. Rather here it is similar to \"kara\" meaning from.\n\n*Spoiler note* (don't read if you haven't finished this part yet): &gt;!Notice that the sentence その歪んだ欲望を頂戴する (\"We will take your distorted desires\") is not in this one, unlike the others, which is possibly a hint of what happens.!&lt;  \n\n\nI hope this post on Persona 5 hermeneutics has been beneficial. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \n\nPrevious posts:\n\n[First Calling Card (Kamoshida)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/10usyu7/persona_5_first_calling_card_kamoshida/)\n\n[Second Calling Card (Madarame)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/114xbyo/persona_5_second_calling_card_madarame/)\n\n[Third Calling Card (Kaneshiro)](https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/1197pw4/persona_5_third_calling_card_kaneshiro/)\n\n[Fourth Calling Card](https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/11avlbd/persona_5_fourth_calling_card_japaneseenglish/)",

The rate I was learning at before was very fast, and I don't think I can replicate that with a full time job.\n\nI'm worried that if I spend time on SRS, and miss my reviews, the reviews would pile up and demotivate me to keep on learning new words. \n\nWhat's an appropriate rate to learn words at when working a full time job? Let's say I have on average 10 hours per week to study Japanese on the weekdays, more on the weekends. \n\nI'm thinking about 5 kanji and 10 words, but worried even that is too much (afraid of being too tired for reviews).

I decided to create an app to help me learn new vocabulary:\n\n[https://polyglotscrivener.com/language-app](https://polyglotscrivener.com/language-app)\n\nThe idea is to learn Japanese vocabulary in the context of sentences. Just by going word after word in vocabulary builders has not proved to be very effective based on some studies. For me, it worked at the beginning, maybe for the first 300-400 words or so, but after that it is being difficult to just memorize new words.\n\nThis is how it works:\n\n\\- Sentences are grouped by topic in what I call bundles. You can add the sentences of a bundle to your dashboard.\n\n\\- Once you have some sentences in your dashboard you can learn, practise and review them using spaced repetition with some fill in the gaps and guess the meaning games.\n\n\\- Learned sentences go to a main table with a \"recall\" bar that shows how well you remember (using an forgetting curve algorithm)\n\n\\- A \"Lessons\" section with a bite-size explanation of some Japanese grammar\n\n\\- There is audio, difficulty levels and you can enable furigana.\n\n\\- Write Kanji game (almost required to use a digital pen) with a grid and show how to write it, still not connected to the main game though.\n\nIt is still at a very early stage, lots of content to be added. It would be great to have some feedback based on the way you are learning Japanese:\n\n\\- Do you find useful to see the vocabulary in the context of a sentence used in real situations?\n\n\\- Although the vocabulary used it is mainly from JLPT N5, there are currently no references to JLPT levels, would that help somehow?\n\n\\- What about the bite-sized lessons? I am planning to build a quick reference to most commonly used grammar.\n\n\\- What do you think about the audio? My Japanese girlfriend says it sounds almost perfect in most cases. Sometimes it might be a bit strange, she saiys, but quite good overall. Is it useful to have male and female voices for each sentence?\n\n\\- Do you find useful to keep you motivated day streak, push up notifications and that type of functionality to keep you engaged?\n\nCheck the details in [https://polyglotscrivener.com/language-app](https://polyglotscrivener.com/language-app) or go straight to it in [https://app.polyglotscrivener.com/](https://app.polyglotscrivener.com/) (no need to register to give it a try)\n\nThanks everyone!",

Mostly people recommend using sentence cards, but personally, I end up remembering meaning of sentences and not focus on the word itself, so when I see the word again somewhere else - very often I just don't remember it! Does this problem go away as you get more familiar with the word even with context?　For me, it's much easier to remember cards WITH the sentences, but because of the problem above, I started again using only a word by itself on the main side, and sentence with it on the back along with translation.\n\nIt may sound dumb, but am I making it harder for myself or not? This kind of thing really shows after a couple of months of the word in Anki, so maybe someone with similar experience can help me out, thanks!",

We created a survey last semester to gain a deeper insight into what learners are actually taking into account when deciding on resources to study with.

I was listening to a few easy japanese podcasts (N4-ish) and realized that I knew most of the vocabulary and could differentiate virtually all of the words being said, but I understood very little of the grammar words and as a result I understood very little of what was actually being said. On the one hand it was really nice to realize that my vocab and listening skills were high enough to not be the bottleneck (I remember both of them gave me so much trouble at the very beginning). On the other hand, it means I need to double down on grammar. \n\nHow does everyone recommend not just learning grammar, but *remembering* it? I started slowly turning [this grammar list](https://jlptsensei.com/jlpt-n4-grammar-list/) (along with the one for N5 grammar) into anki cards, but I find that I have to come up with a mnemonic to remember them just like I do for vocabulary and kanji. Is there a better way?\n\nFor what it's worth I completed all of Genki I and II, but probably didn't devote as much effort to them as I could have. But most grammar points that I encounter don't even ring a bell from Genki. I don't think genki is anywhere close to comprehensive for grammar.",
