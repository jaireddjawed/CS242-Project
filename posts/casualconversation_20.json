        "text": "Hello all, I am 27 and finally feel like my mind is ready to construct a 5-10 year glow-up plan. It won't be easy, but it shouldn't be impossible if I take it one step at a time. I'm so excited to finally be getting started and out of that weird funk I was in where I wasn't accomplishing much of anything for several years.\n\nI returned to school so I can finish my bachelor's degree, switching from a dual in biochemistry and mathematics to computer science with data analysis, which I think I will enjoy more. All those little bugs and microbes creep me out, and I was never fond of drawing hexagons and pentagons all day, either. Dropping biochemistry is probably a good thing for me. \n\nSince computer science is heavily based on mathematical concepts, I decided to switch after attempting a few online tutorials last year. Those built up my confidence level to the point that I felt I could get through school if I buckled down. I've just gotten through the first class with an A.\n\nNow I'm taking Discrete Math, which is pretty difficult. I think I have 60-70 pages of handwritten notes, front and back (so double if you want to count that way, but I don't). And I am maybe 15% into the course. It's only week 1 but I decided to work ahead when the course material opened early because I knew that I would get behind otherwise.\n\nTo assist in my academic endeavors, I've deleted or hidden the \"fun\" browser I used to keep on the desktop next to my \"work\" browser.\n\nI changed the rules on myself. Instead of the computer being for both entertainment and school, it is mainly now only for school since I have so little time.\n\nI'm only here now since I turned in this weekend's homework and took notes halfway through next week. I'm a whole week ahead, and I'd rather be further along still, but I am a bit tired and will probably take a break from notes so my brain can digest these unintuitive logical concepts.\n\nIt helps that I generally find the material fascinating. I've always had a fascination with mathematics, and I'm glad that this translates into coding as well.\n\nI decided I would rather complete a bachelor's degree than take a quick online course because I want to have a deeper understanding of the mathematics required to write good, concise code. I am a perfectionist in my work whenever I can be, neurodivergent as I am.\n\nI have also been going to the gym and taking vitamins lately, which have been wonderful for the healthy lifestyle change I am enacting.\n\nIt's a tripartite healthy lifestyle change:\n\n* Part 1: Physical self-health\n* Part 2: Mental self-health\n* Part 3: Healthy relationships with others\n\nWorking out really does seem to help me regulate my emotions and be a more positive, kind, and gentle human being. During my thirty minutes of elliptical, the first ten to fifteen minutes are torture, followed by the \"I can't do it\" phase at minute eighteen, followed by the \"Fuck it, might as well finish\" when I push past minute twenty. Even when I was doing cardio for an hour four times a week, it would still suck until minute forty and at random intervals in between. Cardio sucks. I only like how I feel afterward.\n\nStrength training is fun to me, sometimes. I'm building back strength that I've lost over the years of not working out after being in prime athletic shape. Classic story, an injured athlete gets depressed and drinks on some weight. Luckily I've decided to nip it in the bud a few years later rather than wait. My back is still ripped due to the pole fitness I do on occasion (I have one in my home). I'm close to being back at the beginning of where I was when I started in the squat rack. I have to keep reminding myself to take it slow so I don't over-exert myself or aggravate an injury. If I take my time, it'll all come back sooner than I think.\n\nI already like looking at myself in the mirror more. My body has more definition already after just a few weeks. It's fantastic.\n\nMental health isn't something I'll get into too deeply here, but I tend to remind myself that dehydration, hunger, malnutrition, lack of sunlight, and sedentariness can each lead to more depressive mood states.\n\nHealthy relationships with others have to be built upon an assumption of mutual trust and understanding, based on the perception of the other's behavior. I remember to pay close attention when getting to know new friends and acquaintances.\n\nWhat do you think you could do in your life to make it better for you? What's your glow-up plan?",

When the POS asked for my signature, it also asked if I wanted to leave a tip.  The preset tip started at 20%...(Yes 20!...I could have left 25 or 30 if i wanted too). \n\nYes, I know that 20% only comes out to a dollar and change, but I was still taken a little aback since I didnt feel I was getting any special service from them. It was a normal coffee shop set up. Order at the counter, pick it up at the counter. Theres 0 waiter service.\n\n I felt bad hitting \"no tip\" in front of them, so I begrudgingly just left 20%. \n\nI normally do leave a dollar (which is basically 20%) on all my drinks, but mostly because the Tip prompt on the screen makes me feel bad pushing \"No Tip\" in front of the cashier.   \n\nAll i can say is, I wish those POS tablets existed when I worked food service!",

May god bless you and everyone that loves you like me. \nI have to admit that was very sweet and it made me very emotional as I was having a long day and was feeling very lonely. \nSo this whole thing happened two days ago. \nTonight I was working and he came in. He wasn’t picking up prescriptions or anything , he said he only came to say hi to me , which i’ll admit i found odd and it made me uncomfortable. He asked me how  my day was and I told him it was better than that one night and thanked him again for his card. Then he asked me what I do on the days I’m not working and I told him I work at my other job. Then he asked if I liked snowboarding. And proceeded to say I should challenge myself to trying new things. I wasn’t feeling comfortable standing there talking to a man twice my age at work and the fact that he came to say hi without having another reason seemed very off. I had someone come in at drive thru and I ran to help them and my pharmacist told me to fill some scripts because I had waiters.  I did . My hands were shaking the entire time because I felt uncomfortable as he stood there waiting for me I guess. I really took my time because I didnt want to go back to talking to him, and I kept going to the drive thru to help people because like I said I did not feel comfortable. Then he disappeared, and he showed up at my drive thru.  I said Im sorry . He said I know youre busy . He handed me this note with his email on it that said : when a friend is in need I’m one key punch away. \n\nMy question is : am I overthinking this and is it nothing I have to be worried about besides a random friendship ? Or does he actually have different intentions with me besides friendship ? Im very frustrated",

And I kind of like the idea of being a werewolf because you can tame a wolf and I'm sure its nice to hug one, ya know cause wolves can be turned into dogs and they can be nice and wholesome if tamed. I kind of enjoy the idea of a werewolf x human. I also enjoy Helluva Boss and enjoy Loona and Blitz's relationship (I hope Loona could get a love interest too in the next season) and I kind of like the idea of something similar to that. Not sure what color I am as a werewolf, and I do also relate to Loona because I did get abused when I was younger and now suffer from schizophrenia as an adult because of it. Any ideas possibly? I'm not sure what color I am as a werewolf and I'm not sure if I have a personality in mind just yet, so thats why I would like some help creating one if possible. Any help would be nice if possible, thanks",

The husband joked around a bit, got his drink and went to find a table, but the wife kept chatting with me, trading sarcastic jokes, teasing, etc. it was honestly great fun. \n\nWhen it came to payment, if you pay by card, the card reader automatically throws a “would you like to add gratuity?” screen with a yes or no option. A lot of people, especially first timers, don’t expect the screen, so they get confused, waste some time reading and figuring it out, pressing “no” and finally making the payment. \n\nI’ve gotten into the habit of pressing “no” because it saves time when the bar is busy and no one really tips anyway. \n\nAnyway, the old lady wanted to pay by card, so I did the usual “no” out of reflex, but she happened to read the screen before I pressed no, and she insisted that she tip me. \n\n“Oh I worked bars a lot when I was your age, so I know what it’s like. Every little bit of tips helps doesn’t it? So come on, let’s do the payment again and I’ll add something for you.”\n\nI said “oh, I don’t really mind, don’t worry about it! Enjoy your evening!”\n\nA little bit of back and forth later, and she asked me why I don’t want the tip, and I basically said that I’m vehemently against tip culture. It shouldn’t be a consumer’s responsibility to replace an employer’s duty to pay their workers a fair wage, and encouraging tip culture in any form is a bad idea. I’ve already seen it when I go home to America for a semester break, and I don’t want to encourage it here. \n\nIt’s generally better if you leave me a good review, because I can compile good reviews and show them to my senior manager to negotiate a better-than-minimum wage down the line. \n\nShe really respected my opinion and agreed with it, and looked around the bar for my manager to say I was a good lad. The manager wasn’t around to hear it, but I’m still gonna happily remember this for a while. \n\nDisclosure: We don’t pool tips because everyone working there has exactly the same set of responsibilities and opportunity, and those who don’t (managers and chefs) are paid higher anyway. So the only person who’s wallet I hurt was mine, and I didn’t mind in this case.",

As a boss, it's nice to have a cohesive team that works well together and has positive feelings with one another. On the other hand, it does kinda sting a small bit that never once am I invited to any of these outings. I do get along well with all of them, and many of them have said I'm one of the best bosses they have ever had. And I get it. I really do. No one wants to be friends with their boss, let alone hang out with them after work. Also, as a boss, being freinds with your employees can lead to bad situations. I understand there has to be a separation. I do. But it does hurt a bit. Does anyone here have any friendships with their bosses, or their employees? How did it go? Any good stories? Any horror stories?",

He shares it with friends and family and has received many compliments on it, some even saying it's the best beer they have ever had.\n\nSo ever since I was little my dad has told the story of how in his first year of college he got a nice bottle of scotch to put in a time capsule for it to mature, and how no matter what he will be there in 2032 to get it back and drink it. \n\nHowever, in a recent “TIL” I found out that scotch does not mature in the bottle like a wine would. Now I don't know if I have the guts to tell him the truth that he just put a bottle of scotch in there for no reason and will probably be very disappointed.",

The thing that intrigued me is that everyone told me she is like me and we fit but they only said it because both of us are quiet(allthough when I meet people better I am not quite at all) anyway she is also extremely cute(Little chubby,cute chicks,very cute glasses and eyes) and I wanted to try and approach her but I have never in my life done it. I have talked with her 3 times. The 1st one was casual small talk where I asked for her interests and went on with mine. The second it was a very quick exchange where we talked about our shifts how we are etc. The third time I tried to go on further and everything was going well Until I asked her if she was silent like me many times. I must have made her nervous because she said: I talk in general. She said it a little awkwardly and then left immediately. I felt awfull because I must have made her uncomfortable and I want to say sorry but I don't know if this will make things worse or if she completely forgot about it but It's been in my head all day and I feel like I messed up badly. I will see her tomorrow and I don't know if it's a good idea to say sorry or it will make things worse or how to approach her more",

And I gotta admit he was kinda smooth and had great game. \n\nBut yeah i thanked him for the offer and politely declined and in the end we ended it while joking about it. \n\nSo if there is anyone here like me who is disappointed about their love life i used to be, i would just say that enjoy your life and be yourself. You are lovable. Someday someone will come into your life randomly and it would be great. \n\n\nHave a great day everyone",

I've been feeling insecure for 10 days but I've improved completely myself.\n\nI've improved completely myself. Once upon a time, Anxiety was killing my life. Within years, I stood up and beat it. I'm proud of myself.\n\nToday, My friends in the company celebrated my birthday. Two weeks ago, I celebrated alone my birthday with Johnnie Walker Blue Label. In 2007, I promised myself after The Man From Earth that I would drink Johnnie Walker Green Label. On 2 December 2022, I did it. Drinking Johnnie Walker Green. For alone celebrating, I opted for Blue Label.\n\nI'll buy the classic watch. Maybe one or two. I planned that bought it last week but earthquakes have occurred in my country. So I've postponed it.\n\nAnyway, I wanna travel abroad. I did before; 8 solo travel to European Cities. I'm considering to travel Singapore. If I do it, It'll be the first time outside of European cities.\n\nI have just one missing situation; Love with a peaceful family. Maybe It isn't necessary. Not sure. I'm single. I sometimes desire a wife and at least a daughter. I've parents, an older brother, funny cousins sweet three nieces, and a nephew.\n\nMaybe I'll get a wife and kids (especially daughters) one day. Life goes on, I go on.\n\nHope the best all.",

I have been slowly killing off what I owe on my car will have it paid off by end of May. I own a house and I only owe 58k left in debt. I make $30 an hour and bust my ass on overtime and refuse to buy the newest fancy toy on the market such as cars and stuff. By the end of 2025 I will have a little over 100k saved and my monthly expenses will only be insurance, lights and gas, food and unforseen shit happening. I plan on putting 75k of the 100k into stocks and taking a small percentage of the 75k a month in profit. I'm guessing there's going to be alot of doubters here maybe not but that's what I would guess but I do not have a family to support so if thus goes tits up it is only going to effect me and no one else. I swear if I had to do another decade of this trash I would CONTROL ALT DELETE MYSELF",

        "text": "I grew up with a crazy mom. I had to lie to her everyday. I never saw it as bad because I was lying for my well being. White people who lied to authorities in the under ground railroad won't be considered bad people because they lied all the time. Obviously it is an extreme example but it still makes my point. I lie to my mom all the time about everything. Someone told me it was manipulative and disrespectful of me. This person had a good relationship with their parents so they don't understand.\n\nI'll give an example. My college degree required me to constantly use very powerful computers. I couldn't afford the $4000 for a personal one so I worked late in the computer lab across the street from my dorm every night. I usually went home at 1am. My mom called me every night just to chat. I made the mistake of telling her that i worked late in the lab every night. She wouldn't go to bed and called me every night to see if i went home yet. If i didn't go home she would stay up and call me every hour until i did. I appreciate the concern but it wasn't helpful. I asked her to stop doing that but she said she needed to be awake in case i needed to call her for an emergency. I told her that she lived 4 hours away, if there was an emergency she was the last person i would call because any help would be 4 hours delayed. I wasn't going to stop working late and she wasn't going to dtop bothering me with hourly calls so i just started saying i was home for the night every time she called. Then she would go to bed.\n\nEveryday my mom would call me and demand to know what i ate in case i wasn't eating healthy so i just lied about it. I had always been a healthy weight and she would threaten to stop paying for college if i got fat. If i accidentally mentioned eating dinner past 6 pm i would get lectured that i would get fat, even if i hadn't eaten anything else that day. So i would just lie about that stuff.\n\nIts messed up that i have to lie about this stuff but i don't think that lying itself is bad its the intent behind it. In my case the intent is to have healthy boundries eith my mom and to have a less contentious relationship. So i see nothing wrong eith lying. Lying to a spouse to cheat? Huge deal, very bad. I do believe that communication is a psrt of a healthy relationships. I am open and honest with partners and friends but not my family.",
