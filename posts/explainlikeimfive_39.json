        "text": "I have a friend that recently watched the Netflix show ancient civilizations and he is really into this idea. As someone that is more inclined to believe the experts in this area, I tend to think these ideas are more science fiction, but after talking with him, I realized I don’t really know what conclusive evidence we have that disproves the ancient civilizations idea. I see carbon and other dating brought up a lot and the general lack of evidence of any civilizations, but these alone seem somewhat weak to me. What are the main reasons we know this not to be true?",
