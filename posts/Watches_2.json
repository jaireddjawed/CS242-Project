The Vincero is 42 mm, and the Orient is listed as 42 mm on the Orient website, but some websites list it as 41 mm. I have a Citizen Eco Drive and a Fossil (both 42 mm) and they seem to be a little bigger than the Orient.\n\nOrient is of course an automatic, but the Vincero is battery operated (though it has veen dead for three years). Orient has a mineral crystal, but the Vincero has saphire.\n\nThe Vincero is heavier, and the Orient is actually pretty light. Not a huge fan of that, I believe these kind of watches should be on the heavier side, otherwise they seem cheap.",

So much depth in this piece that only videos will do it justice. \n\n\nFun fact, Moser is one of the only companies in the world capable making that one heartbeat like spring (which takes 12 weeks to make). If you haven't already look into the brand. Even if it's not your style you can respect the stuff they've done in the industry. They're pushing the boundaries and as a result, there's some serious watchmaking going on with their Tourbillons, minute repeaters, Flyback Chronographs. \n\nThe quality is on par with the best in the industry. I think one day this bad boy will be worth a pretty penny when Moser gets the recognition they deserve! \n\nFr tho if Breguet made this it would be 150k minimum, so I really feel like I got my money's worth.",

        "text": "I'm a first-time expectant father looking to buy a watch to commemorate this occasion. I'm looking something that is:\n\n1. Casual enough to be a daily driver\n2. Sub-$1000, so I feel that I could actually wear it daily\n3. 40mm case width and below; ideally, something that could be passed down to my daughter and she could wear it if she wanted\n4. White / silver / blue / black dial, in decreasing order of preference\n\nLooking for some advice on my current picks, as well as **any suggestions**! My current picks are:\n\n1. [Hamilton Field Khaki Auto Silver Dial](https://imgur.com/a/P3mRrlk): I feel like this fits the bill fairly well so it is my top contender. The only downside is that I already have a Seiko 5 field watch, so I feel some sense of redundancy owning this.\n2. [Mido Minifort Patrimony](https://imgur.com/a/QlYmUwD): I love the look of this watch, but **I think it's classified as a dress watch?** I'm curious to hear opinions on this. Compared with the Hamilton, I think the Hamilton will look much more reasonable in a super casual dad-outfit, whereas the Mido leans towards business-casual. For example, I couldn't rock a Bambino in my everyday wardrobe, and this shares some similarities.\n3. [Junghans Form A (Titan, Black Dial)](https://imgur.com/a/zfuMwOq): I think the Form A (with arabic numerals) is very clean and understated. I actually prefer the white dial, but Joma has the black in stock which is why I'm considering it (but feel like the outer dial markings in \"burnt tobacco\" are borderline illegible).\n\nI've been in my own head about this way too much. Appreciate any advice!",

        "text": "Hi. I just recently got into watches and I've been reading a lot on this subreddit and other forums. I am interested in getting a GADA watch for daily use at work and casual social happenings., and I really like the aesthetics of the Rolex Explorer. It seems like the perfect watch for most settings, and a good 'one watch collection'. As of now, i neither can afford nor are able to buy a Rolex Explorer, so I am looking for an affordable alternative with the same 'feel' \n\nI've been looking at some alternatives, but would love to hear your opinions and/or experiences. What I'm looking for is a watch between 36-39mm with a bracelet, Arabic numerals, a sapphire crystal and water resistance of at least 100m. \n\n   \n \n\nThe options I've found so far:\n\n\\- Tudor Ranger: The most expensive option on this list, and it would really be a stretch, but I like the look of it. I don't mind the \"butt plug hour hand\" or the coloring of the dials that a lot of people have been complaining about. I will be able to try on this watch at my local watch-store which is a plus. And also would start a costumer relationship with an AD in case I want to buy an Explorer in the future.\n\n\\- Longines Conquest: I've been reading a lot of good things about this watch, and it grows on me the more I read. I really like that it has 300m, and that Longines is a well reputed company. Same thing as for the Tudor, I will be able to try this on at a physical store. \n\n\\- Smiths Everest: I've heard that this is almost impossible to bey at retail, but it could be worth a shot. I've read a lot of good things about this, and I like the numerals on this more than the Explorer. \n\n\\- Islander Manhasset: Never heard of this brand before, but from what I’ve read they make good watches for the price. The most affordable option, and might be a good entry point before buying a more expensive watch later. \n\n\\- San Martin: I'm not sure what I feel about a straight copy/homage watch. On one side it looks great and I’ve read good things about the brand, but it feels somehow disingenuous. Would also be kind of embarrassed to turn this in to a respected watchmaker for service. (If there even is a point to servicing a watch at this price range).\n\n   \n \n\nSorry for the wall of text, if anyone had any advice it would be much appreciated.",

        "text": "People who have amassed a beautiful collection of luxury watches, do you still keep your first? I guess this also applies to any watch in your collection that you haven't worn in over a year.\n\nI've just started building my collection and very much hoping to turn it into my perfect collection very soon. My first watch was a yellow dial Accurist, I got after securing my first job post graduation. At the time I thought it was absolutely the bees knees &amp; quite an outlay considering my childhood watches all cost less than £10. So theoretically it has some sentimental value and yet I just can't ever image myself wearing it as my collection develops. My taste s have changed now.\n\nOn the one hand it seems a shame to send it to a charity shop, but on the other hand is there any point in having a watch you never use. \n\nThoughts?",

Mainly because it had a product placement in one of my favourite Video Game of all time (Yakuza). \n\nI was thinking back and forth on actually buying the watch for months now but finally decided i want it. I guess this is my first watch i bought simply because i like it a lot, no thoughts about reselling and keeping the value. Simply getting it for my own joy. It does feel refreshing because normally i am a lot more conservative when it comes to watches, hence never posting here because why the fuck would you guys want to see your next average rolex joe. \n\nWatch feels really good but im still intimidated by it's size. \n\nAnyhow im happy that i went through with it and maybe some of you like the watch.",
