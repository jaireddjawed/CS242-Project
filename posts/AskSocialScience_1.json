        "text": "[This article](https://www.earthmagazine.org/article/comment-building-sanctuaries-increase-civilizations-resilience/) advocates creating archival sanctuaries to preserve the world's knowledge in the event of a collapse. It sounds simple enough--just load a huge computer with as much information as possible, bury it and wait. But will the people who dig this computer up know how to operate it? Will they even speak the same language the information was written in? How can we harden the world's knowledge against shocks and damage? I suspect that, in addition to a massive material effort, a lot of resilience-building would involve working with intangible aspects, like language, culture, and the myriad ways we communicate information. Are there any societies that have preserved valuable information for extremely long periods--and through major disasters--that we can learn from? Also, yes, I'm aware of the field of [nuclear semiotics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-term_nuclear_waste_warning_messages) and several of the more out-there ideas that some have pitched",

        "text": "I'm helping someone wrap up a qualitative research study of which a major theme is stigma/discrimination. The data has been collected and analyzed, but now that I'm looking at their intake survey, it turns out they forgot to ask about sex/gender, and did not ask proper questions about culture/ethnicity (e.g. they asked \"are you Indigenous or a POC\", but didn't ask if someone is Black or White). They did ask one question about whether participants belonged to a list of vulnerable groups, but it turns out the survey was also designed in such a way that you could only pick one response, so if you were LGBT and Indigenous, you had to choose which one to pick.  \n\n\nMost of our participants ended up being minorities, and had an interesting array of opinions on stigma/discrimination in a predominantly white society. Except because of the way the intake form was designed, almost no one selected a response for the half-baked question we did have about vulnerable groups. My PI is saying that it's qualitative research so it's ok to not have that information, but to me it seems flawed to present findings on stigma/discrimination without proper information on participant characteristics. I get that qualitative research is not meant to be generalizable, but our inclusion criteria was very broad and we had participants from across the country...so it feels weird to not be stating that most of our participants happened to be minorities. Am I being unnecessarily nitpicky?",

Of course, they fail to acknowledge that their struggles aren't exactly the same, the unique historical contexts, the different ways they still experience discrimination, the effect of good stereotypes vs negative ones, etc. Not to mention downplaying Y group's achievements while treating X group as a monolith.\n\nBut another big thing that seems to be ignored is that often X group still has an advantage over Y group.\n\nUsing my own background as an example, I am mixed race and a Quaker. Quakers were discriminated against in England and America, with many being imprisoned and even killed for their beliefs. Yet, they were still able to own slaves, and participate in white institutions. I would never deny the persecution they faced or how it impacted them, but they still had a leg up above my black ancestors. The same can be said for many other groups that immigrated, especially those that are white, but from different ethnicities or religious backgrounds. \n\nI know there is a pretty strict idea of \"privileged\" vs \"oppressed\" classes, but couldn't it be argued that most of society falls into both to some degree?",

Or Asian people can treat black people poorly, or vice versa, solely on account of race.\n\nAnd so the argument proceeds. The academic describes structural/systemic/institutional racism, while just calling it ‘racism’ without any adjectives… and the lay person pushes back with examples that indicate they understand racism to mean the dictionary definition of racism….  ie anyone poorly treating or thinking less of anyone else because of their race.\n\nIt seems like a completely unnecessary  argument, because often times, a progressively minded lay person already completely accepts that systemic racism exists. And academics accept that anyone can treat anyone else poorly solely because of that persons race.\n\nSo why does there seem to be a reticence to simply say, “oh, you’re talking about racism like it’s defined in the dictionary. I’m talking about systemic racism. They are both things, but they’re just distinct concepts.”",

        "text": "Alright, so recently there was a census in the UK that shed some light on the trans population, which numbered at about 262000. Recently, a lot of people, particularly this [blog](https://wingsoverscotland.com/the-rorschach-test/), extrapolated the data on trans women to make conclusions about their rate of sexual offenses with numbers gleaned from a few different FOI Requests ([Here](https://questions-statements.parliament.uk/written-questions/detail/2022-01-06/98878), and [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lumnCTIcCQEWLhIBrm6kNRz75xPw7e4b/view)).\n\nIn the UK this shook out to about:\n\n11,660 men serving time for sex offences out of 29.5m = 1 in 2530 men\n\n103 women serving the same time out of 30.4 million = 1 in 295,000 women\n\n92 transwomen serving the same time out of 48,000 = 1 in 522 transwomen\n\nThey compare this with stats from New Zealand.\n\n1155 males from a 2.4 million population = 1 in 2018 men\n\n5 females from a 2.5 million population = 1 in 500,000 women\n\n15 trans identifying males/transwomen in 4,900 = 1 in 326 transwomen\n\nStats from Ireland, Scotland, and Australia are also mentioned in the blog, but there numbers are quite low, so it's hard to conclude much. Now, the blog making this claim definitely has a bone to pick, clearly in an attempt to cast suspicion on trans women, and to my knowledge it's actually run by a gaming enthusiast. Also, I don't know if the census actually captured the true amount of all trans women accurately,  but it's hard to argue when I don't really understand if I have the full picture with this data. So ultimately, does the data imply what this blog wants it to imply?",

        "text": "My question relates to the gender identity aspects of felt same-gender typicality, felt pressure for gender differentiation, and intergroup bias.\n\nMy understanding of the normal developmental for these attributes from what I've read is as follows: Assuming no disruptive events or abnormalities, felt same-gender typicality develops around the preschool age, and its level, whatever that may be for a specific individual, remains at a relatively constant rate. Felt pressure for gender differentiation and intergroup bias also emerge at around the same preschool age, but follow a different developmental course. These two attributes slowly begin to decrease after the preschool years and continue to do so up until adolesence, at which point the attributes spike again, then afterwards begin to slowly decrease again and continue to do so throughout the remainder of that individual's lifespan.\n\nWith that said, suppose we had a situation where a child at around the preschool age was put through a humiliating situation deliberately that also had a major gender identity component. What sort of psychological and developmental harms would this be likely to cause? Could it have a considerable detrimental effect upon felt same-gender typicality? Could it both solidify and intensify felt pressure for gender differentiation and intergroup bias? And are there any academic papers that make a serious attemp to investigate and measure this?\n\nA very extreme example of this hypothesis potentially playing out is through the histories of many notorious serial killers:\n\nhttps://www.eviemagazine.com/post/multiple-serial-killers-were-forced-to-dress-in-drag-growing-up\n\nA large number of them suffered ongoing and repeated humiliation and abuse in the form of extreme gender threats often being made to wear girls clothing by their mothers. I know that studies have predicted that low felt same-gender typicality combined with high felt pressure for gender differentiation predicts poor psychosocial adjustment. Also high intergroup bias can make it more likely for someone to engage in aggresive behaviors. If there are studies that agree with my hypothesis then it's possible that I just might have cracked the code on what fuels some of the most dangerous people.",

Now, he admits that these metrics were acknowledged in the protocol, but that doesn't seem to satisfy him. The implication is pretty clearly that he thinks they're hiding bad results. \n\n[Part 2: Everything else](https://jessesingal.substack.com/p/the-new-highly-touted-study-on-hormones)\n\n* It found a high suicide rate\n* They were only small improvements in the measured areas\n* the improvements might've been due to therapy\n* he doesn't think appearance congruence improvements mean anything significant\n* Also he thinks that increases in congruence for AMAB patients mean that it's unlikely that their lack of reduction in anxiety was due to lack of bodily changes.\n\nNow, some of these points aren't exactly convincing to me, and in some cases it seems like he's scraping for points to make, but I'm not particularly well versed in assessing studies like these, so I have to ask, is his assessment of the study correct?",

Many people are frustrated by corrupt politicians, legislative bodies that are dysfunctional due to severe partisanship, the globalized economy and policies that have benefited the rich and ultimately widened social inequality, and unresponsive or slow-to-respond government agencies. They also often feel threatened and marginalized by the demographic changes and diverse identities that globalization and democratic development have brought to their societies.

        "text": "My sociology professor briefly mentioned that there is no such thing as overpopulation, but an overconsumption. I'm actually done with sociology, but I found this a very interesting point. \n\nWhen I look at many peoples views on overpopulation, they still hold on to the malthusian dilemma. They think that the food increase is linear, and the increase in the number of births is exponential. This means that there are, or will be too many people in comparison to the food that is available. But in reality our planet can produce enough food for the number of people living on our earth, and the people that are yet to be born. \n\nThe growth of our population has little to no impact on climate change. It is the lifestyle that we as humans have created for ourselves that is causing the earth to decay. The problem is that we consume too much, so the solution is not to have fewer children, but to have a redistribution. \nHaving fewer children will lead to many negative consequences in the future and is therefore anything but ethical. There will be a very high population of old people, and a shortage of young people. The number of retirements will rise while the number of working people will fall. The working (younger) people will therefore have to pay more and more taxes to finance the amount of retired people. In addition, the elderly will need to have  additional services, such as housing and all types of care, and these are also costs paid by the working people.\n\nThe people who have to bear the burden of all these costs, will have less money to spend and that will inhibit economic growth. Because of all these consequences these people will probably tend to limit the amount of children that they will be having, which will cause the trend to continue. (many older people, few young people)\n\n\nDo you guys agree, or am I oversimplifying the situation? Are there any important points I haven't thought of, or are there any elements you guys can disprove? I would love to read your opinions and to educate myself more about the matter.",

        "text": "I'm a student going to start university this year and I recently came across an essay on Aeon titled 'The helpful delusion', which I found a very interesting perspective on the function our emotions serve. The timing also happened to coincide with one of my introductory psychology classes where I learned about 'learned helplessness' and how it's a signal from your brain to stop doing something that you keep on doing despite repeated failures.\n\nBoth the essay and the concept of learned helplessness gave rise to some questions that I thought someone here would be able to resolve for me or at least guide me towards the right path. The first question is- Could it be possible that negative emotions like anxiety and jealousy don't actually indicate that there exists some problem in our daily lives, but that they are the problems themselves; put another way, could it be that it's just because of these emotions that we are compelled to change our way of doing things, and we that we would've done just fine without them?\n\nI understand that some of our instinctive visceral reactions and intuitions evolved to help us survive in an environment where the cost of not listening to your emotions was quite high, but in the modern world, I notice that the intensity of such negative emotions is too high and so they cause too much suffering which makes me doubt whether the benefits of these emotions really outweigh all the suffering that they cause. Would a person who doesn't go through such emotions over a long period of time really be at a risk proportionate to the suffering they need to deal with, when it's not even clear what the emotions are saying and whether they are really beneficial or just dysfunctional?\n\nWhat's the line separating dysfunction and a healthy amount of emotions? When do we know that an emotion is pushing us towards changing our life situation, or just an unnecessary malfunctioning of our biology that needs to be cured? For instance, in learned helplessness, when do we know we should really stop trying to achieve our goals, or we should push ourselves despite repeated failures because circumstances change and oftentimes emotions lead to irrational decisions?\n\nOne last point I'd like to mention involves psychopaths and their ability to not feel any emotion. I usually wonder if overall their satisfaction with life is higher, because even though their lack of inhibitions leads to excessive risk-taking behaviour, they don't go through prolonged periods of suffering, and the only cost is an increased risk of death. Some would argue that death is better than suffering, and I also think we could learn something about the mechanisms of emotions from them.\n\nI'm still a beginner to this subject, but I am curious about knowing the answers to these questions. I apologize in advance if my questions reflect a poor grasp of the topic or that I seem to have misunderstood any concept you attempted to explain. In that case, I'd be willing to learn and greatly appreciate it if you could help me clear my doubts. Thank you for taking the time to read my post.",

If there is no right to seccesion: let's say that Group A is the majority in a country but Group B is a majority in a part of that country. Group A puts people from Group B into concentration camps because why not. I believe that Group B has the right to secede from the country. However, on the other side, if people can always secede:Group A is the majority in a country, Group B is majority in a part of that country. Group A isn't oppressing group B, Group B has equal rights to group A, yet Group B still wants to secede in the name of ethno Nationalism, irredentism etc. I don't think that group B has the right to violate their country's sovereignty in this case because their reasoning behind why they want to leave is insignificant kr even threatening to the other group. Of course, these are very simplified examples. What are your opinions on this topic? I think that we should have a consistent criteria on whether a state's secession is justified or not and that it should be a part of international law.",

        "text": "As I understand it, mainstream or \"orthodox\" economics comprise of solely the neoclassical economics  in microeconomics and a synthesis of neoclassical and Keynesian economics in a macroeconomic level.\n\nBut, as I have come to understand, neoclassical is more a methodology or a school of thought, the same with Keynesian and the Marxian, and not a prescription. For example, neoclassical economics embraces methodological individualism , marginalism and the subjective theory of value etc. But I do not see why this would lead to pro-capitalism ideas. It is maybe silly, correct me, but in the basic textbooks there are no capitalists, there is no state, only demand and supply. Sure, demand and supply is a neoclassical \"invention\", but why doesn't it lead to anarchism, let's say?\n\nWhen in mainstream economics, you work on a model, how do you know if its a neoclassical or whatever? I guess it has to do with the assumptions you make. Rational choice theory etc. But the normative analysis you want to extract out of it, why the prescription should be pro-capitalism necessarily?\n\nPartly, I inspired this question since I've been reading some analytical Marxists trying to embrace the methodology of mainstream economics but still have anti-capitalist, pro-Marxian sentiment and results. I found it to be really powerful, not without its faults of course, but I like the idea of a neoclassical-Marxian synthesis, but in terms of methodology mostly.",

Is racism a subset of xenophobia, or are they mostly synonymous within most usages of the word. \n\nFor instance, if a White European visitor to America experiences favorable treatment, in general in the span of 2 months, from an African American, can this be said that therefore America is racist \n but not xenopobic according to this hypothetical example?\n\nIn the same token, if a person of Jewish ancestry is historically ostracized (and therefore othered), and then unjustly treated as a group, we'd call it a racism and xenophobia or is it just racism?\n\nI'm just really confused as to labeling what is racism and what is xenophobia. Are they one and the same? Or is something just racism but not xenophobia (and vice versa)?\n\nThanks in advance.",

        "text": "Okay so, I recalled [an interview](https://www.transadvocate.com/fact-check-study-shows-transition-makes-trans-people-suicidal_n_15483.htm) from Dhejne a while back wherein she offered counterarguments to common misinterpretations of her study, one of which was that it proved that treatment increased suicidality. She pointed out that the cohort of 1989-2003 showed no such increase. Of course, not everyone took this lying down, and one of the commenters, Dean Jackson, posted a counterargument that I'm having trouble parsing, which I will quote directly.\n\n&gt;differences in mortality disappeared, she never specified **suicide**, suicide rates being the topic at hand.... the attempts at suicide for SRS recipients have normalized with the generalpopulation because the attempts have become more successful, and suchattempts at suicide are more successful for SRS recipients than thegeneral population thanks to the handy convenience of theanti-depressive medications SRS recipients have access to\n\nHe also claims that the study did not include any of the data from the 1989-2003 cohort, save for the Hazard Ratio which only describes time between treatment and hazardous event. I thought he was referring to raw data, but I couldn't find the raw data for either cohort. He claims this was to cover up an increased suicide rate, but I find that unlikely.\n\nNow, as other people in the comments pointed out, one has to *attempt* suicide to commit suicide. And at a glance, while the hazard ratio doesn't sort out types of death by cohort due to sparse data, the fact that mortality has normalized alongside suicide attempts makes it unlikely that successful suicide attempts have significantly increased. Otherwise the implication is that transitioning makes one less likely to die from a cardiovascular disease or neoplasm than the controls. He also quotes the study's conclusion \"This study found substantially higher rates of overall mortality, etc.\" ad nauseam, and acts like Dhejne's claims about the more recent cohort came out only during the interview when they're actually noted frequently in the study. He appears to be hung up on Dhejne noting an increased rate of suicide and mortality in that cohort while ignoring the fact that it wasn't statistically significant.\n\nNow, this largely seems pretty cut and dry to me, but I'm not a scientist, so I feel obligated to run this by someone first.\n\nEDIT: Oh, and he also said this\n\n&gt;The study was published in February 2011 and says, \"...the survival curve (Figure 1) suggests increased mortality from ten years after sex reassignment and onwards.\" Study publication being early 2011, that tells us that the data is confined up to 2010. \"ten years and after\" is 1999 and after, so we're missing all data for 2011 and 2012, not including the data that is \"onwards\" from those two years and the previous eight years. When those years' and \"onwards'\" data are included, statistical significance is easily achieved.\n\nI wanted to ask what it meant, but frankly I'm having a hard time discerning what his point actually is? If his point is that data after 2012 shows significant increases in mortality and suicide attempts, I'd love to see THAT study. Other commenters said that the normalization of mortality was because the differences took ten years to emerge in the older group and didn't have enough time to emerge in the newer one, which might be what this is trying to say, but the two cohorts observed a pretty similar amount of time.",

Slavic languages seem to prefer a hundred, e.g. Polish 'sto lat', 'a hundred years', which is a traditional wish for a long life.\n\nObviously, part of this is linguistic: it's unlikely to be a coincidence that Mandarin for 'ten thousand' is *wan* (萬), a single character and a monosyllable, not three syllables across two words as in English, and Polish 'hundred' is another monosyllable, *sto*. But also neighboring cultures tend to share this kind of symbolism.\n\nAre there broader patterns?
