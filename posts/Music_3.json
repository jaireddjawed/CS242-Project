        "text": "Quick question (or not so quick depending on how much of a mind puzzle it becomes, lol): I am trying to figure out what genre my band The Lowmen would fall into. \n\nWe are a trio with Acoustic Guitar, Hammered Dulcimer, and Electric Bass. Our music is a mix of a bunch of songs written by our lead singer Jon and covers of a variety of bands like The Beatles, Metallica, Phish, Ween, Moody Blues, and Motley Crue. We put our own twist on them, and we fit a lot of complex solos into our gigs.\n\nThe first thing that pops into my mind is since we have the Dulcimer and add a slight folk feel to our stuff especially the stuff with a rock feel (many covers and the like, but a lot of Jon‚Äôs writing has a folk feel to it), that we would be folk rock. However, we don‚Äôt use much distortion and we only occasionally have drums with us. Would there be another folk-based compound genre name that might fit us well? Not many band layouts that I can draw an analogue to, but I am trying to figure something out for marketing. Local restaurants really want a quick genre name, and I find it hard to nail down what we are because of the variety. All I know is at the places we have played, despite some songs being rough around the edges at times. people really enjoy our stuff. Any ideas?\n\nHere are a couple videos of us playing\n\nGolden Rose: By Jon\nhttps://www.facebook.com/100066394337164/posts/pfbid0imci9XfsM4Bir8sexuYiizdmWNHTqtfpwjwiNdxEdFf4ftWv6JkEnzukAHEDVdhCl/?app=fbl\n\nNothing Else Matters (Partial)\nhttps://youtu.be/TI1-FirxmoY\n\nCaptain Black (original)/Shipping Up to Boston/One More Cup of Coffee\nCaptain Black//Shipping Up to Boston//One more cup of Coffee\nhttps://youtu.be/Yrlc2czQ-pg (Uploading as I write this)",

Even Michael Jackson's Thriller, the best-selling album of all time, contains several disco songs.\n\nI think it was in the late 80s that the style generally considered disco \"died\". That's simply because new dance music had already become mainstream by then. To be precise, it is not correct to say that it died. It evolved into a new style. Rock today bears no resemblance to rock in its earliest days, but no one is saying rock is dead. I think the same thing happened with disco.",

        "text": "Kinda venting out something that I feel that should be said to the public opinion -   \nMusixmatch allows apps like spotify to have people writing and editing bands lyrics (there's an opting out here but lets not get into that).  \nThat seems neat as a lot of music that doesn't have written out lyrics EASY like that (but most you can find if you search for them, ORIGINAL lyrics).  \nBut it ends up being so horrible as it allows people to edit at will and here where things get ugly.  \nSome edit out of hate or just personal pettiness and similar stuff, editing stuff that kinda sounds the same but just isnt (and you can confirm if you have original lyrics)\n\nSome think they are right but just downright get things wrong and change the whole context of the music.  \nOthers really dont care and write some incredibly absurd stuff.  \nThat is a crime to music. If you don't know the lyrics its best to not have any than some random internet shmuck thinking they know better, it distorts and manipulates things that arent yours.  \nAnd it ends up influencing and manipulating people.  \nA simple \"Aren't\" instead of an \"Are\" because some random shithead WANTS it to be that because he heard it (and it isn't the artists actual writing) changes a whole composition.  \nFuck this shit.",
