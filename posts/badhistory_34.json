And that the first Greek science was devised by the Milesian School of philosophy:\n                                                                                                                                                                                             \n\nThe milesian school was founded in the [6th century bc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milesian_school) certainly   not in the beginning of archaic Greece.\n\nBut that is nothing compared some other crap this website says:\n&gt;The Albino people of today, who are invaders from Central Asia in the modern era: Germanics, Slavs, and Turks; are degenerate fakers of history, so as to make it appear that they participated in the making of Western History. To this end they not only lie and make up false history, they also create fake artifacts of every kind. Here are some things to look out for with the Bronzes.\n\n That is so wrong on so many levels that I have to ask what was he thinking,Slavs were [not from central asia](http://web.archive.org/web/20141011055733/https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/28dgwo/what_are_the_origins_of_the_slavs_how_did_they/) Germanic people were of course from [central Europe and Scandinavia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanic_peoples#Origins) Also well the thing about turks is correct , the bronze statute part is just wrong. \n\n&gt;As Herodotus tells us in Book 1 - CLIO; the Whites were tribes of barbarians who were granted voluntary entrance into the ranks of Hellenes. \n\n[non,no,no](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histories_(Herodotus)) Book 1 does not talk about a invasion of Greece by foreigners  and certainly not ''whites'' invading Greece. \n&gt;Though by appearance, Odoacer was probably a Celt/Gaul: they being the original people of Germany. With the actual true (White) Germaic's following. Note that Odoacers hair stands straight up, White peoples hair cannot do that naturally. (Laugh at the example if you will, but the point still holds true, also note Vercingetorix's hair).\n\nOne it is debatable if odoacer hair is standing up besides what sounds more rational to you A Germanic Bahrain was black or A germanic barbain had  hair that stands up. \n\nWhile there is far moro stuff in here(they say a holy roman emperor was black) I am getting tired of this crap, so you are going to have to explore the rest of the website yourself! \n",

        "text": "While I understand that sources and scholarly opinion on the French Revolution vary wildly, this post in particular made me cringe so hard (ignore the fact that the person in the original post compared blacks killing whites to a \"French Revolution Part 2\"):\n[The Revolution was disorganized and thousands of people died because of it](http://np.reddit.com/r/TumblrInAction/comments/373ouw/tw_facebook_black_girl_justifies_the_killing_of/crjff5v)\n\nTo start off, /u/Magmas gives us a good generalization: \n\n&gt;The French Revolution was absolutely abhorrent, resulted in the deaths of literally thousands of people, both innocents and guilty, because the people revolting were unmanaged and had no goals.\n\nBecause wanting to first demand a constitution from a king, then wanting to have a Republic isn't a goal at all. Additionally, the user managed to negate the entire organization of the [French First Republic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_First_Republic) all at once. Because having a proper constitution, a legislation, a military, and a court is just another sign of rowdy masses.\n\n\n&gt;For all intents and purposes, the French Revolution was not only an absolute failure, but a meaningless waste of life\n\nSo basically [about 200 years of French Revolution historiography](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influence_of_the_French_Revolution) has been wasted because the historians were ultimately recording something that absolutely failed and was thus meaningless.\n\nNext comes /u/ManderTea, with this gem:\n\n&gt;It actually ended with Robespierre on the throne, who was then executed. Napoleon came shortly after the revolution ended and the nation stabilised. And while he styled himself \"Emperor\", he was by no means as much of a tyrant as Louis XVI or Robespierre. However, I wholly agree that the Revolution has been heavily romanticised, and that in reality it was absolutely disgusting what took place.\n\nSo even during the Republic, Robespierre, the man who hardcore-supported the notion of a Republic and proper representation of the people, still wanted to sit on a throne. And then came Napoleon, who was the pinnacle of virtue and stabilized France, and [who by no means decided to wage war against most of Europe.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleonic_Wars) Yeah, real stability here.\n\nEven though I understand that it's somewhat pointless arguing against people determined to do anything to prove social justice warriors wrong, I can't in good nature look the other way with this post.\n",

        "text": "This article is actually several months old, but somebody posted it to Facebook today, and nobody there will ever take my word for anything.\n\n[Queen Victoria Dreamed Up the White Wedding Dress in 1840](http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/queen-victoria-sparked-white-wedding-dress-trend-1840-180953550/)\n\n&gt;Though white is now seen as a symbol of virginity and purity, in the mid-19th century, white was the color of mourning—not a color in which to be wed, says the Washington Post. So, when fashion-forward Queen Victoria donned a white dress for her wedding to Prince Albert in 1840, she met with criticism. (In addition to the color faux pas, “Victoria’s attire was considered far too restrained by royal standards, with no jewels, crown, or velvet robes trimmed with ermine,” the Post says.)\n\n&gt;After Queen Victoria's white dress, however, the trend caught on. Before her, women would wear a dress that fit the fashions of the day. Now it's rare to find wedding dress that isn't white, though they do exist.\n\nEveryone *loves* this story, and the basic facts of it are true - namely,\n\n* Victoria wore a white wedding dress, and it was uncharacteristic for royalty\n\n* At some point after this, white became the predominant color for wedding dresses\n\n* For a long time, wedding dresses were simply good day dresses\n\n(Technically, white *was* a permissible mourning color at the time (complete white was allowed for full mourning, but I've never ever seen that in anything but an etiquette book; second and half mourning could involve white-on-black or white with dark colors), but that's not really important to the reactions of the time.) \n\nNear the end of the 18th century, white suddenly became an extremely fashionable color (especially in cotton). There are so, so many extant gowns and portraits of women in them from the [1790s](https://www.pinterest.com/mimicofmodes/1790s/) and [1800s](https://www.pinterest.com/mimicofmodes/1800s/), and because of the veracity of Point Three, this means that a lot of wedding dresses during those decades were white. Once brighter colors became more fashionable than white in the late 1810s, white held on in fashionable and expensive wedding dresses - in fact, whenever the magazines showed wedding dresses during the [1810s](http://nms.scran.ac.uk/database/record.php?usi=000-100-104-783-C), ['20s](http://ccdl.libraries.claremont.edu/cdm/singleitem/collection/fpc/id/186/rec/25), and ['30s](http://ccdl.libraries.claremont.edu/cdm/singleitem/collection/fpc/id/246/rec/34), they were white. Like the Post said, her dress was seen as too restrained - too much like an ordinary rich woman's dress. I mean, [this plate from 1837](http://ccdl.libraries.claremont.edu/cdm/singleitem/collection/fpc/id/190/rec/13) shows a dress that's remarkably similar to [Queen Victoria's](http://www.royalcollection.org.uk/collection/search#/16/collection/401413/queen-victoria-1819-1901).\n\nAnd even after this event, most women continued to wear a colored dress for their weddings and have it as a \"best dress\" afterward. White cotton was no longer a fashionable fabric, and white satin and taffeta were uncleanable and thus restricted to women who could have a one-use-only wedding gown. The reasonably well-to-do, the women from the better families of smaller towns whose clothing is preserved in house museums - their wedding dresses [continued](http://chapmanmuseum.pastperfect-online.com/30796cgi/mweb.exe?request=record;id=4570EABC-A7CC-4DEF-9F6F-298475015469;type=101) to be [not white](http://chapmanmuseum.pastperfect-online.com/30796cgi/mweb.exe?request=record;id=D847A371-38B2-46A5-AC66-521264425450;type=101) (although [exceptions exist](http://chapmanmuseum.pastperfect-online.com/30796cgi/mweb.exe?request=record;id=68865753-A28D-4F8F-81B1-872215512549;type=101)).\n\nWhat seems to have put the white wedding dress within reach of the majority of women is the second rise of white cotton. [Lingerie dresses](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/228065168605880371/) were among some of the first ready-to-wear clothes, and could be pretty affordable compared to tailored outfits that required better fabric and more fitting. (The top part would often be [loose at the waist](http://chapmanmuseum.pastperfect-online.com/30796cgi/mweb.exe?request=record;id=2F61D9F7-2B8D-4651-BCF6-890423775605;type=101), tucked into the skirt and pulled out strategically to poof where it was supposed to poof.) From the turn of the century on, wedding dresses that aren't white or off-white/ivory are the exception, and they usually go along with an explanation of a death in a the family or a very small, private wedding.",

        "text": "[This map](http://i.imgur.com/Pv1mYp7.jpg) here, showing \"Indian cessions\", has been going around /r/MapPorn lately. Unfortunately, quite a bit is wrong here:\n\n1) Florida\n\nThe earliest cession in Florida (excluding the area around Orlando/Lake Okeechobee) is reported as being \"1820-1824.\" Wikipedia says that the annexation of Florida to the USA occurred in 1821, which perfectly fits this map. However, by the 1780s [Florida was part of Spain, which is most definitely *not* an Amerindian polity.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Florida) In fact, the oldest non-Indian settlement in the USA, Saint Augustine, is located in...Florida. The map on the upper right shows the claimants of Florida (with modern state borders) being \"Florida Indians.\" Apparently, that's what the Spaniards are calling themselves now. (Everglades Indian history is a mess, so I'm not going there.)\n\nAlso note the absence of the Seminoles, who were able to mount armed resistance as late as the [1850s](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seminole_Wars), who were granted autonomy (including two seats in Tallahassee) in the 1860s, and who were never fully [conquered.](http://dos.myflorida.com/florida-facts/florida-history/seminole-history/)\n\n2) The West, including the various Mexican cessions, is all shown as wholly Amerindian up until its annexation. California is shown as Indian up until the mid-1800s, even though there were Mexican and before that Spanish settlements well before. [Pio Pico](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C3%ADo_Pico) either don't real or was an Indian.\n\n3) The Louisiana Purchase is handled inconsistently. New Orleans (founded 1718) is shown as a European cession while it was a French and later Spanish settlement, as is west Texas. However, California, the Florida Panhandle, and New Mexico, which all had quite old European settlements such as:\n\nPensacola (1698)\n\nPalatka ([1767](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palatka,_Florida))\n\nSanta Fe (1610)\n\nSt. Augustine (1565)\n\nFernandina Beach (~1760s as an outpost of [Georgia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernandina_Beach,_Florida#French_flag))\n\nRanchos de Taos (1725)\n\nEl Paso (1680)\n\nare still shown as Indian territory.\n\n3) Indian Territory\n\nUp until 1907, most of what is now [Oklahoma](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Territory) was a patchwork of reservations known as \"Indian Territory.\" Although the population was not exclusively Indian ([slaves and limited white settlement was allowed](http://www.infoplease.com/encyclopedia/history/indian-territory.html)), the 1820s-1830s cession dates given on these maps are highly misleading.\n\nSummary: Spaniards and Frenchmen are Native Americans, unless they're in Louisiana.",

Attempting to compare today's socio-economic and political situation to that of the Middle Ages, the left half of this pretty diagram, published by a site called *The Amendment Gazette*, is a glorious collection of bad everything. Unsurprisingly, it had also found its way to /r/conspiracy.\n\nLet's start at the top of the pyramid.\n\n&gt;**Monarchs**\n\nThe fact that many monarchs couldn't actually do everything they wanted and had to struggle with powerful nobility aside, what strikes the eye is the percentage of population these monarch presented (0.00001%) compared to the percentage of all landed gentry... Apparently there was a king for every 10 landed nobles. Such is life on the Sto Plains.\n\nAlso, that would mean that at the demographic peak, Europe had about 10 monarchs at a time, so it seems there were like 5 countries all in all.\n\n&gt;**Landed gentry - Dukes, Earls, Barons...**\n\nAll landed nobility, of course, is the same. Even the lowliest, poor baron wields the power and influence akin to that of a great duke. Nothing to see here, move along.\n\n&gt;**Clergy - Archbishops, Priests...** \n\nHere, again, a common priest is in the same category as the most powerful people in the Church, like archbishops. Let us completely ignore that some archbishops, for example in the Empire, wielded huge political power, akin to that of secular princes. Everything must fit into the pyramid!\n\n&gt;**Merchants - Traders, Explorers, East India Company**\n\n*East India Company*... in the Middle Ages... the English one founded in 1600, or maybe one of the other companies founded even later?\n\nAlso, naval exploring in the late Middle Ages was mostly limited to Portuguese shenanigans down the African coast and many of them were actually nobles (like Tristão and de Azambuja) gathered around Henry the Navigator, so I'm not sure what the author is shooting for here, presenting explorers as their own special class. Hopefully, someone with more knowledge about this subject will correct me if I'm wrong.\n\nThe issue with merchants is also that not all countries were monarchies, and in some cases influential merhcant families would be the ones ruling the state (for example the Italian maritime republics). \n\n&gt; **Vassals - Tenant Farmers, Military Officers**\n\nWhat the hell is this category even supposed to be and why aren't other people, like landed gentry, in it? The evil tenant farmers are part of the oppressive 1%. There are also (apparently low-ranking) Medieval military officers. Luckily, the author helpfully provides us with a picture of such an officer, a famous Medieval admiral Horatio Nelson.\n\nThe author then quickly rounds up everyone else, including *consripts* (!!!, maybe they meant levies) under the aptly named Everyone Else category.\n\nEvery category is of course accompanied by a pretty picture, most completely anachronistic and one taken from a comedy film (after all, we all know that Medieval peasants were mud-caked, unintelligent, witch-burning mob).\n",

I thought they were joking. Then after a few comments I honestly though they were trolling. Now I'm just frustrated.\n\nAnd here is my favorite one:\n\n&gt; Without constructs in place, humans will devolve into kin-based tribes. \n\nbecause there are two kinds of people; nationalists and cave-men\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n^^No ^^jokes ^^beyond ^^this ^^point\n\nNow the reason I was triggered is of course that I view nationalism as something that causes unnecessary troubles and conflicts, which you may or may not agree with. I guess if this person had stuck to claiming that it brings people together rather than causes division then that would maybe have been fair. I wouldn't have agreed, but there wouldn't be much /r/badhistory material. \n\nAnyway, here is a quote by the commenter after I had voiced my opinion on nationalism:\n\n&gt; I will counter by pointing out that your implicit claim that nationalism is not an effective tool for binding non-kin groups together is not founded in historical fact, but rather is a critique of the consequences of nations of people as not being peaceful to others not within that nation. What nationalism does is enable larger and larger groups of people to appear to each other to exist within the same kin-group.\n\nVery fancy writing. That's normally when I start to suspect I'm dealing with a delusional high-school kid from Moldova, but I shouldn't be mean. The problem that we have in our discussion is that nationalism is usually about an ethnic group or people, but this person means to say that being patriotic and waving a flag is what nationalism is, regardless of what you centre the ideology around. Now this I won't argue about, because I know that in the US the word \"nation\" does not mean the same as it does when you say it in most european languages, and I am, truth be told, not an expert on the subject.\n\nAlthough he does say this:\n\n&gt; For example, The United States is a multi-ethnic society (English,French,Irish,Germanic, Slavic, Greek, Turkish, African, Hispanic etc etc) with a strong tradition of European nationalism, that is intense loyalty to the concept of the governing state. The same could be true of Austria-Hungary before it devolved to due to racial tensions or the Roman Empire before it devolved due to racial tensions.\n\nWhich is where it starts to become funny. Why would \"european nationalism\" specify nationalism that is *less* about ethnicity than... whatever other kind of nationalism there might be.\n\nAnd the entire reason for Austria-Hungary to even bear that name and be a dual monarchy, was to appease the Hungarians because nationalist sentiments were causing dangerous division within the empire. Not that there weren't other reasons for the hungarians to want \"representation\" or whatever we should call it, but Austria can't rule everything by itself. You know what I'm trying to say lets not get caught up in the details, becase there is more fun coming. Such as the gross claim that Roman Empire devolved due to racial tensions. And for that matter, does this person mean that nationalism was a glorious unifying force that just failed to keep Austria-Hungary together in the face of \"racial tension\"? That doesn't even make any sense.\n\nSorry if this was an unfunny wall of text. Here is the thread it's from btw. The commenter seems to argue this with everybody. And btw I do know that I'm perhaps being an arse, but I never intended to start a big discussion about that, I honestly didn't think they were serious.\n\nhttp://np.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/36va1l/as_a_dutch_person_im_offended_by_this_map/crheyrn",

Another example of a language that is different from its family members is French, which has a lot of un-Romance features. We know how this happened in France - the Romans invaded and their language took over eventually replacing the language of the local Gauls. There was a similar theory about the Indo-Aryan invasion of the Indus Valley civilization, which was used by British authorities to justify their own subjugation of Indians. However, evidence actually supports a much [more complex truth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Aryan_migration_theory) - that the Indo-Aryans due to changing climate started moving their pasture towards the Indus Valley civilization. The Indus Valley people similarly struck by climate change started abandoning their cities by the Indus river and settling on the Gangetic plain. The language that came out of this cultural encounter is what we think of as Vedic Sanskrit, with the original languages underneath some form of old Indo-Aryan (spoken by the pastoral people) and ~~old Dravidian or Munda~~ (spoken by the Indus Valley people).(Kubhā-Vipāś substrate)\n\n&gt;The REALLY interesting part of all of this is that we see features borrowed into Vedic Sanskrit that are a hallmark of bilingual speakers - people who knew the  substrate language as well as the Indo-Aryan tongue.\n\n&gt;This is the end of the facts and the beginning of speculation. Why would this be? If it was pure conquest and genocide, there would be little to no substrate influence and India as a whole wouldn't have 'areal' linguistic features (Subcontinental languages are more like each other than their family members). If it was pure assimilation, there would be no Indo-Aryan speakers. The hypothesis I like is based a bit on economics and how language functions in human society.\n\n&gt;The city-dwelling substratel-anguage-speakers would have had little useful vocabulary to contribute to their now very different existence - skills such as metal-working and engineering would have little use in the now more rural existence, post-collapse. The impoverished Indus Valley folks would have to rely on the pastoral Indo-Aryans for much of their trade and sustenance, and so slowly grow to accept their words more and more, losing their own domain-specific vocabulary first and their general vocabulary soon after that.\n\n&gt;The original population of Indo-Aryans was probably small with respect to the Indus Valley peoples, and short of famine or disease wiping out a huge portion of those folks, they continued to dominate demographically, but switched out their language for the Indo-Aryan one (while keeping their 'accent' on it). Archaeogenetics of South Asia bears this out a bit - we don't see a large amount of genetic contribution from Central Asia while we do see some evidence of indigenous roots for [Indian DNA variation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics_and_archaeogenetics_of_South_Asia#Autosomal_DNA_variation).\n\n&gt;TL;DR Ancient North Indians probably spoke a substrate language and switched to Indo-Aryan once their lifestyle changed. That's a lesson for today as well.\n\nAlso, /u/one_brown_jedi 's comments\n\n&gt;Common ancestors of some Indians and Europeans, identified by the Y-haplogroup R1a, have been proven beyond doubt. Also, many right-wingers claim Out of India theory (OIT) has been proven beyond doubt.\n\n&gt;Furthermore, only right-wingers use the terms AIT and AMT. Modern academia uses the term \"Indo-European migration\" (occasionally Indo-Aryan). This is no \"honest inquiry into history\", this is ignoring scientific evidence and cherry-picking studies.\n\n[This](http://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/36xu3d/excavations_show_harappan_site_died_as_saraswati/crie7j5) comment of jedi is also helpful. As /u/adwarakanath 's comment [here](http://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/36xu3d/excavations_show_harappan_site_died_as_saraswati/cridwg8)\n\nParticularly this part:\n\n&gt;Just because the Harappan civilisation died out when the Saraswati died out is not proof that they were a Vedic civilisation. Stop reading Amish Tripathi; he writes fiction. And Rajiv Malhotra is NOT a trained historian or even an academician. And not supporting the ridiculous OIT does not automatically make one a \"Marxist\" historian. Do you guys even know what Marxist historiography entails? Ffs. ",

        "text": "Yes, I know I'm a masochist but I'm endlessly fascinated by the way hysterics take the story of Hypatia and make ... well, a story out of it.  The latest culprit is [this garbage](http://whatsupruston.com/hypatia-shining-star-of-alexandria/), which is a particularly spectacular example of the fantasy-hysteria version of Hypatia's story, so warped and bizarre I award it four Sagans.  \n\nI've just written a long take down of it as a comment, which is likely to either never see the light of day or do so briefly.  So, as is my wont, I'll post it here as a R5:\n\nWow.  There is so much bungled history in this article it's hard to know where to begin.  \n\n&gt;\"According to Jone Johnson Lewis ... \" \n\nWho? \n\n&gt;\"when the Arabs invaded Alexandria around 642, they burned the contents of the library, including the works of Hypatia, as fuel for their baths.\"\n\nWell, let's kick off with some Arab bashing.  That story was a legend told hundreds of years later as a kind of urban myth and no historians take it seriously.  There was no Great Library when the Arab conquest happened (642 AD), because the last remnants of it had been destroyed in the sack of the Royal Quarter by the Roman emperor Aurelian back in 273 AD.  So, no.\n\n&gt;\"Hypatia studied with her father, and with many others including Plutarch the Younger\"\n\nWho?  There was no \"Plutarch the Younger\".  The only scholar named Plutarch was the Greek historian who lived from 46-120 AD.  Given that Hypatia was born c. 350 AD - i.e. 230 years after Plutarch died - he would have had to use a time machine for Hypatia to \"study with\" him.  These kinds of blunders show how bad your sources of information are.\n(*Edit*: I was wrong here - there was a fourth-fifth century Plutarch.  But he taught in Athens and never taught Hypatia)\n\n&gt;\"she has been credited with inventing “a brass hydrometer for determining the specific gravity of liquids, an astrolabe for astronomical observations, a system of distillation and other devices.\"\n\nYes, \"credited\" by people who don't have a clue.  She did not \"invent\" a hydrometer, though one of her pupils wrote to her asking her to have one made for him in Alexandria and then *explained to her* what the instrument was and how it worked.  That would be a bit strange if she had \"invented\" it.  And astrolabes had been around for centuries - she didn't invent them either.\n\n&gt;\" Like Hypatia, Orestes was a pagan\"\n\nPardon?  No, he wasn't.  He was a Christian.\n\n&gt;\"Lewis says that Orestes 'objected to Cyril expelling the Jews from the city, and was murdered by Christian monks for his opposition.' \"\n\nThen this Lewis must have discovered some new source unknown to any historian of the period, because there is nothing about Orestes being murdered in any of the sources we have.  Or maybe Lewis doesn't have a clue and is just making stuff up.\n\n&gt;\"Hypatia, a pagan espouser of experimental science and friend to Orestes, was blacklisted by Cyril who was appalled at the behavior of a woman “who didn’t know her place” \"\n\nNone of this is in the sources either.  Especially the \"experimental science\" bit, given that none of the philosophers of this period did anything like \"experimental science\".\n\n&gt;\"Historians believe that his tirades against Hypatia incited an angry mob of “fanatical Christian monks in 415 to attack Hypatia as she drove her chariot through Alexandria” (Lewis)\"\n\nI can't speak for what this \"Lewis\" person believes, but actual historians are aware of the political dispute that was the actual cause of her assassination and the fact that her murder was part of a series of tit-for-tat murders in a struggle for political supremacy between Orestes and Cyril (both Christians).  But I guess that's not as fun as \"wise scientist killed by Christians for being wise\".  Who needs stuff like context and facts - let's just make up any crap we like?\n\n&gt;\" ... and killed her by flaying the flesh from her bones with oyster shells\"\n\nActually they stoned her with roof tiles, which were nicknamed \"sea shells\".  But whatever.  See above about actual facts and evidence and knowledge of history being no fun.\n\n&gt;\"Some historians believe Hypatia’s assassination heralded the Dark Ages during which the patriarchal Church ruled with an iron fist, stifling the arts and natural sciences for the next thousand years. \"\n\n\"Some historians\" such as who, exactly?  Given that in the generations after Hypatia Alexandria saw a succession of scholars like Hierocles, Asclepius of Tralles, Olympiodorus the Younger, Ammonius Hermiae and Hermias, the wicked old Church did a pretty bad job of \"stifling\" things.  They also seem to have done a bad job of oppressing female pagan philosophers, since just after Hypatia's time Aedisia taught in Alexandria and remained unkilled by Christian mobs.  Then again, unlike Hypatia, she stayed out of the city's violent politics.  The only \"dark ages\" in this period happened in far off western Europe and had zero do with the Church and everything to do with a little thing called the collapse of the Western Roman Empire.  Alexandria was in the *Eastern* Roman Empire - the bit that didn't collapse for another 1000 years and which preserved ancient learning for it to be picked up in the west later, via the Arabs (them again).  And picked up by who?  Umm, the Church.  So everything in your sentence above is not just wrong, it's backwards.\n\n&gt;\"Patty Mooney has been writing since the age of 16.\"\n\nPatty Mooney needs to learn how to do basic research.  Fail.",

Historically the eye of the needle is a small gate on the side of a castle where it was possible but very difficult for a merchant to get their camel through. The merchant would have to unload his goods first before getting the camel through the eye.\n\nIn response, I posted a couple of articles discussing the meaning of the \"eye of the needle\" phrase from *Arabica* and asked for citations for the controversial claims - admittedly, my sources were from the late 1970s and 1980s. That said, the sources seem to imply that the \"small gate\" reading of \"eye of the needle\" is false; essentially, there were no references to that particular apocryphal tale and affiliated reading of scripture prior to the 9th century. \n\nTaking exception, /u/doppleprophet was quick to let me know that I am, in fact, an idiot. Apparently when I intimated that there was no evidence for the alternative reading for \"eye of the needle,\" I had failed to account for the fact that reddit posts *themselves* count as historical evidence. As he informed me:\n\n&gt;First of all there is historical evidence for that reading: He read the verses and stated his interpretation as taught to him. The historical evidence of the reading is his post describing his reading.\n\nI think that this should be sufficiently bad history to not require an explanation, but here goes. A post on Reddit detailing my thoughts on a particular issue does not count as historical evidence for the acceptance and validity of my interpretation. I don't know if I should source this or not . . . \n\nFor bonus craziness, check out [this historical source website](http://www.interfaith.org/) to which I was so graciously linked. It includes such scholarly entries as:\n\n\n\n&gt;FORUM: Past Lives\n\n&gt;Have we all lived before?

Look at [this table.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_of_World_Heritage_Sites_by_country) France, Italy, Germany, Spain, and the UK together have 194 World Heritage Sites. Meanwhile, China, India, Mexico, Iran, and Nigeria together have 131 World Heritage Sites, despite all five of them having been the center of [mighty empires](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aztec_Empire) and [great cities](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Ancient_Benin_city.JPG) both [quite recently](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qing_dynasty) (and even today, given China's massive status on the world stage) and [far before western Europe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elam). Some of western Europe's World Heritage Sites include [farmhouses from the 19th century](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decorated_Farmhouses_of_H%C3%A4lsingland) and [mines from the Industrial Revolution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_Mining_Sites_of_Wallonia), while [M'banza Kongo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%27banza-Kongo) or [the Nanjing City Walls](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_Wall_of_Nanjing) are still only tentative sites.\n\nI mostly agree with u/typesoshee [here](http://np.reddit.com/r/MapPorn/comments/21k5h2/eurocentrism_of_the_unesco_world_heritage_sites/cgely4v), though I only have limited knowledge on the WHS application process, so corrections or expansions are welcome.\n\n&gt; The thing is (and the greatest argument in favor of Eurocentrism being a major factor), if your country has some valuable site, you don't just sit and wait there and hope that UNESCO puts you on the list.  [There's an application process.](http://whc.unesco.org/en/nominations/)  This means that the more a government has to spend on tourism and have close relations with the UN (i.e. a richer government), the more they can bother with applying for UNESCO sites.  If you're too poor or most tourists don't come to your country anyway to begin with, you've got bigger fish to fry than to put energy into some UNESCO application. \n\n&gt; [.....]\n\n&gt; I think the combination of a richer government (higher GDP/capita, which can bother funding preservation efforts) and the preponderance of stone structures in Europe is a non-Eurocentric argument for what we see [.....] I think the later the picks, the more likely that a rich country got a \"meh\" site approved while a lower GDP/capita country finally got around to getting a deserving site approved. \n\n&gt; The pictures on the Wikipedia pages do bring up again the issue of preserved-ness.  The Swedish farmhouses are well-preserved.  Xanadu/Shangdu is mostly ruins.  But in places like China and India, GDP/capita is a huge factor.  There are decently remaining sites littering the area in these places.  You just can't be bothered to pay more money to your tourism bureau or whatever to go around and fund museums for every single one of them.  Anyway, if you keep cherry-picking from each year, comparing a site from a richer country and one from a poorer country, you often find that discrepancy.\n\nFor an instance of disproportionality between richer and poorer countries *within* East Asia, consider how [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namhansanseong) is a World Heritage Site, while [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortifications_of_Xi%27an), which is longer and older, is not. I doubt there is any intentional Eurocentrism in the World Heritage Site nomination process; it, like (too) many other things, simply appears to be biased towards richer countries, of which there are more/most in Europe. Not to mention that if China (for example) were to have half of the World Heritage Sites Western Europe has, UNESCO would have had to select three Chinese sites *every single year*; the size of countries such as China and India are important factors as well.\n\n---\n\nHowever, most Redditors on the thread seem to disagree that the skewed distribution is because of the current state of the world; no, the profusion of Heritage Sites in Europe must be because *only Europe has real history*! \n\n&gt; [But [Europe] is old and there is a lot of heritage there.](http://np.reddit.com/r/MapPorn/comments/21k5h2/eurocentrism_of_the_unesco_world_heritage_sites/) [+13]\n\nEuropean history does go far back. And consequently there is plenty of historical sites in Europe. However, that alone does not explain why there are far, far more World Heritage Sites in Europe than in all other continents. Let's use Sweden and Vietnam as an example (Sweden has 13 cultural world heritage sites, Vietnam has 5).\n\n&gt; old\n\nThe first writing by someone living in modern Sweden are runic inscriptions in [the Elder Futhark](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elder_Futhark), which according to Wikipedia emerged between the 1st century BC and the 2nd century AD. However, the people of [Nanyue](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanyue), including much of modern Vietnam, were already writing during the reign of King [Zhao Mo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhao_Mo) ([Zhao Mo's seal](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Wendi_xingxi_3.jpg)), who reigned in the 2nd century BC. If history is limited to written events (which I disagree with, but that seems to be the general sentiment of the linked thread) Vietnamese history is older than Swedish history.\n\nIs Sweden older than Vietnam in terms of political organization? Not true. Nanyue - an organized and centralized kingdom - existed long before Swedes were even writing. Four centuries before [Erik the Victorious](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_the_Victorious), Vietnam had [emperors.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%BD_Nam_%C4%90%E1%BA%BF) \n\nHow exactly is Sweden older than Vietnam?\n\n&gt; there is a lot of heritage there.\n\nThere is also a lot of heritage in Vietnam. It's impossible to determine what exactly constitutes as \"heritage\" and something does not, but if we're counting regional farmhouses as World Heritage, Vietnam, which has always had a much, much larger population than Sweden, probably has more.\n\n---\n\n&gt; [So I guess you think it's unfair or something? How can you be surprised that there are most heritage sites in areas where most proof are left of early and modern civilizations? It's not eurocentric. It's just how it is.](http://np.reddit.com/r/MapPorn/comments/21k5h2/eurocentrism_of_the_unesco_world_heritage_sites/cgdwqst) [+41]\n\nThere is no easy way to quantify \"proof of civilizations.\" However, I'm sure there is a very large number of \"proof left of early civilizations\" in the Middle East, and \"proof left of modern civilizations\" in China, even compared to western Europe. Even accounting for the fact that Chinese buildings were often built with wood which is easily destroyed, there is no way Western Europe has *five times more* \"proof of early and modern civilizations\" than China.\n\n---\n\n&gt; [Also notice that while China is ancient, most of it is rural and never had many signs of civilization.](http://np.reddit.com/r/MapPorn/comments/21k5h2/eurocentrism_of_the_unesco_world_heritage_sites/cge0e6p) [+15]\n\nBecause Europe was always hyperurbanized, amirite?\n\nIn 1500, Europe (excluding Russia and the Balkans) had an urbanization rate of 9.6% if we consider every settlement with over 5,000 inhabitants a city. A hundred years later in 1600, the urbanization rate had risen to 10.8% ([source](http://www.paolomalanima.it/default_file/Papers/CITY_COUNTRY1300-1600.pdf)). At the same time in Ming China, the urbanization rate was around 11~14%, higher than Europe's. (Source - *China Urbanizes: Consequences, Strategies, and Policies*, the introduction deals with historical urbanization)\n\nIn fact, Song China in the 12th century had already reached an urbanization rate of 10~13%; in fact, it has been speculated that the total population of urban dwellers living in Song China equaled the total population of cities everywhere else. This is not as ridiculous as it sounds; the population of Kaifeng, its capital and the largest city in the world at the time, was nearly a million.\n\nTL;DR: Yes, throughout most of history, most of China has been rural. However, throughout most of history, most of Europe has also been rural, and for centuries the urbanization rate of China was higher than Europe's.\n\nI also find the claim that rural China has \"never had many signs of civilization\" preposterous. Out of China's 37 cultural or mixed World Heritage Sites, about 10 are located in primarily rural areas. Some of them are *by definition* rural sites, such as the [Tulou of Fujian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fujian_Tulou), while [others](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wudang_Mountains) are in mountainous terrain.\n\n---\n\n&gt; [Tell me again how to Aboriginals in Australia have had a long-lasting culture with lots of buildings/ritual sites. Tell me again how the rural part of China is filled with cultural heritage (not according to the list, but cultural heritage in general); tell me how what they have on their farms includes 10 times as much cultural heritage (again, not according to the list, but in general) than all the heritage in Germany (similar amount of population).](http://np.reddit.com/r/MapPorn/comments/21k5h2/eurocentrism_of_the_unesco_world_heritage_sites/cge0rux) [+22]\n\nOn indigenous Australians:\n\n&gt; a long-lasting culture\n\nIndigenous Australians had long-lasting cultures, many of which, such as [Pintupi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pintupi) culture, persist to this day. But of course this isn't to say that Aboriginal culture was static; cultural change has been documented in rock painting styles and other archaeological evidence. \n\n&gt; lots of buildings\n\nFamously, the Gunditjmara people lived in a mostly permanent society, based on the farming of the eel. They modified over 100km^2 over the landscape for eel farming, building channels and ponds for the eels; the eel farming area (less than 0.002% of Australia's area, the country being more than 7 million km^2) could have supported up to 10,000 people (1% of the Aboriginal population, even with a high estimate). It has been theorized that the eels were exported throughout southeast Australia. ([source](http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/03/12/1047431096364.html), [source](http://www.abc.net.au/science/news/stories/s806276.htm)) Gunditjmara elders agree that they \"were not nomads.\" \n\nSo it is no surprise that [the Gunditjmara built stone houses.](http://www.smh.com.au/ffxImage/urlpicture_id_1047431101436_2003/03/12/nat_hut.jpg) Lots of them.\n\n&gt; ritual sites\n\nAboriginal Australia had thousands of ritual sites and sacred places.

A couple of points:\n\n1. I don't know where the 60 million number comes from. Yang Jisheng estimates 36 million, Dikotter estimates 45 million (and this is definitely on the high end of estimates). There are higher numbers that estimate the difference between the actual Chinese population and the extrapolated population from pre-famine trends, but that doesn't measure deaths, just the delta in population growth.\n\n2. China's main trade partner was the Soviet Union before the GLF and during the GLF the relationship between the two deteriorated: Khrushchev was alarmed by Mao's behavior and withdrew much needed Soviet aid. China had been a beneficiary of trade with the USSR in that it was a supplier of technical expertise and heavy capital items. From the 60's until the late 70's China was economically quite isolated, which didn't exactly help to say the least.\n\n3. The famine was actually due to a combination of inefficient large scale collectivization (combining village scale communes of, say, 10-20 families into gigantic collectives of hundreds or more families); terrible distribution (emptying of granaries, free food giveaways, urban procurement with total disregard for rural well-being); horrible labor misallocation (moving rural labor into cities, moving agricultural labor into inefficient rural industry); and straight up quack science (overplanting, deep tilling, etc.).\n\nThis comment brought to you by a sub meant to \"generate intelligent discussion\" lmao",

An actual publication is always so much more fun to debunk than a random Reddit comment, and I can't help myself. Besides, [there's even a movie with this one!](http://www.looksfilm.tv/en/written-mrs-bach) :D\n\nSo what is the bad history here? The theory put forward in both the comment and the article is one that was initially proposed by Professor Martin Jarvis of Charles Darwin University that some of J.S. Bach's most famous works - the Cello Suites and the fugue from the Well-Tempered Clavier - weren't written by Bach. Rather, they were written by his second wife, Anna Magdelena Bach, and published under his name because she couldn't get recognition or publication otherwise. To be fair, the idea that a female composer might have published under a man's name isn't a terribly unique one, and there is definitely precedent for believing it could have happened. Fanny Mendelssohn, for instance, published pieces under her much more successful brother, Felix's, name just to get some exposure for her compositions. The difference between that and what's being proposed with Anna Magdalena, however, is that both Felix and Fanny recorded that they were doing this, and Felix made it very clear that he was happy to do this for his sister. With the Bachs, this isn't the case. \n\nAlso, there's the fact that the rest of the evidence is basically shite. \n\nEssentially, the case that our good friend Dr. Jarvis makes is that, in the aforementioned pieces, the writing style is sufficiently different from a copyist's style that it's clear someone was composing rather than copying a piece that had already been written. That is the crux of his argument. There are a few additional arguments that have been tacked on that talk about how the style of those pieces differs markedly from other pieces Bach wrote, and how one manuscript includes a small notation stating that it was \"written by Mrs. Bach.\" There's also some circumstantial evidence that he brings in in the trailer for the film, and which I'm more than happy to go through. All of this \"evidence,\" though, laughably misunderstands music theory and the German language. Also life. It misunderstands life.\n\nTo start, though, it helps to know who Anna Magdalena Bach was. Anna Magdalena Wilcke (or Wilcken, it's unclear what her maiden name was) was an accomplished singer and court musician in her own right. She was born in 1701 to a family of court musicians, and by 1721, she was performing as a court musician in Köthen. She sang and played the harpsichord, both of which likely attracted Johann Sebastian's interest. In 1723, after the death of his first wife, he and Anna Magdelena were married. They then proceeded to have a long and happy life of making music together - with Anna Magdalena serving as his copyist, as well as Bach himself writing pieces specifically for her - and having babies. \n\nDr. Jarvis makes a lot of claims about their relationship that, frankly, I don't know where to begin debunking. He makes the claims that Bach's first wife committed suicide upon learning that Bach was having an affair with Anna Magdalena, that Anna Magdalena was hated by all the children, that she and Johann were denied a church wedding, and all that. They're a lot of lurid claims that sound straight out of a soap opera, and as I said, while I probably could go rummaging around to try and debunk them, I'm not much inclined to do so. Why? Quite simply, it has no real bearing on the underlying claim, namely that Anna Magdalena composed pieces under her husband's name. So what if Bach had an affair? So what if no one liked Anna Magdalena? Why does that matter in the slightest?\n\nWhat matters is whether or not there is any evidence at all that Anna Magdalena was a composer, and whether she composed the Cello Suites and the fugue from the Well-Tempered Clavier. Jarvis' evidence, as I said, comes primarily from the idea that the handwriting in those pieces is different from what would ordinarily be expected in a copyist's handwriting. Jarvis claims it's lighter, less deliberate, and more musey, things that, to be fair, one would expect if someone were composing rather than copying. \n\nThe trouble is, though, that nothing else about the manuscript looks like it was composed. For reference, [here's](http://javanese.imslp.info/files/imglnks/usimg/2/21/IMSLP07437-Bach_Suites_Manuscripts.pdf) one of the earliest known manuscripts for Bach's Cello Suites, and one which was written by Anna Magdalena Bach. It's clearly handwritten - here and there, you can see imprints from where the ink hadn't properly dried, and bled through to the next page or left a mark. However, compare it to something like [this](http://www.mfiles.co.uk/illustrations/brahms-symphony-4-page1.jpg), an excerpt from Brahms' Fourth Symphony. First off, Brahms has much worse handwriting than Anna Magdalena, but second, notice that this manuscript is clearly written by someone composing. It has stretches where notes can only really be described as scrawls, bits where you can tell he didn't feel like writing anything for a particular instrument, and - most importantly - mistakes. In the viola section, he scribbles out an entire series of notes, then squishes in more notes next to it to make up for it. If I'm not mistaken - and correct me if I am - I believe he scratches out \"viola\" entirely and replaces it with a different instrument. This is what a composed manuscript looks like. It's covered with mistakes and corrections, and written in unintelligible scrawl. It's rushed and flurried, and has those hallmarks of someone thinking and changing as they go. \n\nNow, I'll grant you. Anna Magdalena and Brahms are not the same person. Each could have had their own distinct styles and their own way of writing. However, compare the Cello Suites to [these pages](http://burrito.whatbox.ca:15263/imglnks/usimg/4/4b/IMSLP22972-PMLP06107-BGA44_17.pdf) from the *Grosse Klavierbüchlein,* composed by Bach for Anna Magdalena, but copied by her. The handwriting is more or less the same. That Bach composed the *Grosse Klavierbüchlein* isn't in doubt - there are some pieces of his that are, but I won't get into that here unless someone wants me to - suggesting that if someone wanted to analyse handwriting to determine whether or not Anna Magdalena wrote something, they'd better start assigning all of Bach's pieces after his marriage to her. Which is silly. Don't do that.\n\nThere are a few other \"points\" that Jarvis makes as well to support his argument, though he himself states that it mostly relies on handwriting analysis of those pieces. One claim from the documentary's preview is that the structure of the Cello Suites and the Fugue is radically different from what Bach had previously written, and that the use of symmetry was previously unheard of, and for which there is no other precedent in the Bach canon. However, this is once again a claim that's not terribly difficult to debunk. Hell, [here's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_in_B_minor_structure) a Wikipedia article not about a piece, but about the *structure* of one particular piece, and how it is largely symmetrical. \n\nJarvis also claims that Bach didn't begin to write his truly phenomenal pieces until after he married Anna Magdalena, implying that Anna Magdalena directly contributed to or even wrote some of Bach's most memorable works. While he does have a point when he says that Bach didn't write his greatest pieces until after he married Anna Magdalena, he's also missing the point entirely. Bach married Anna Magdalena in his 30s, before which he'd been a new, inexperienced composer. Throughout his marriage, his skill grew as he became more and more practiced. The vast majority of composers don't start composing their greatest works until their 30s at the earliest. Bach not being an exception doesn't mean he was a hack.\n\nJarvis also brings up the fact that, on the original manuscript of the Cello Suites, an inscription in one corner says \"Written by Mrs. Bach,\" albeit in German because Anna Magdalena didn't speak English. He translates this as meaning that Anna Magdalena composed the piece, when, in fact, German doesn't work that way. Jarvis misses that there are two different verbs here, one being \"geschrieben\" (written) and the other being \"komponieren\" (composed). Guess which one Anna Magdalena uses, and guess which one would need to be used if Jarvis' theory were to hold any water.\n\nI could go on, but I think I've made my point. There is no evidence that Anna Magdalena composed at all, let alone that she wrote Bach's Cello Suites and the Fugue from the Well-Tempered Clavier. She was a gifted musician, don't get me wrong, and music certainly played a huge role in her life and her children's lives. Indeed, many of her children went on to become more famous composers and musicians than their father, something which attests to just how musical their household was. However, that doesn't mean that Anna Magdalena composed anything. There's no evidence of it.\n\nWhat I think is the most interesting thing about this, though - and the reason I chose to write about it - is why Jarvis is doing this. In the documentary, he talks about wanting to reclaim women's music from a male-dominated (who am I kidding, pretty much exclusively male) canon of Western music. He's absolutely right that there's a lack of women's voices in classical music, and continues to be, even in modern music. However, assigning music to women in a laughably unprovable way isn't the way to solve the lack of representation. Saying that Anna Magdalena Bach was secretly a magnificent, canon-changing composer doesn't make it so, and if anything, hurts the cause of bringing women's music to the fore.\n\nThroughout, Jarvis makes the claim that women were oppressed and unable to compose under their own names, thus making his claim about Anna Magdalena seem more justified. There is an element of truth to that, as I pointed out with Fanny Mendelssohn. However, I think the real bad history underlying Jarvis' theory is that it strips away the identity of women who *did* compose, and who *were* known for their compositions. Rather than celebrating them and what they did, he instead hides them under the banner of \"oppression,\" and finds it easier to claim men's compositions as women's instead of looking at what women actually wrote.\n\nTo be clear, women were often discouraged from composing. [Maria Anna Mozart](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Anna_Mozart) is pretty much the perfect example of this. However, I'd also like to point out [this list](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_female_composers_by_birth_year), and the fact that some of the composers listed there - like [Hildegard von Bingen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hildegard_of_Bingen) - are some of the pre-eminent composers of their era, where much of what we know comes from them. Others, like [Clara Schumann](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clara_Schumann), outshone their husbands in their day, and have only recently been forgotten or over-looked. Women have been writing music of their own and under their own names for centuries. It might not have been grand operas, but that doesn't make it less legitimate as music. \n\nHerein lies the problem. It seems that the only way people like Jarvis - and indeed, many of the concert organisers, radio DJs, and conductors - are willing to acknowledge or play women's music is if it is a certain genre, or if it is something that's immediately recognisable (that \"immediate recognisability\" is a problem throughout classical concerts, though, and is why you'll have trouble finding a classical music concert of anyone who didn't did more than a century ago). It leads to shutting out the music of all these women, and holding concerts that play men's music 98.2% of the time. The solution isn't to reclaim music women didn't write.

        "text": "So some Botanist is out here announcing that he's going to announce that he has discovered, *in plain sight* mind you, a likeness of Shakespeare on the cover of John Gerard's *The herball or Generall historie of plantes.*\n\nhttp://www.cbc.ca/news/arts/authentic-image-of-shakespeare-part-of-400-year-old-botany-book-historian-says-1.3078948\n\nSkipping all of the obvious alarm bells like the fact that this guy isn't a trained historian, and that he's going to a popular media frenzy before peer review, and that he's basing his argument on \"Cracking the Tudor Code\" and shit, this is just lazy.  He's jumping to the conclusion that this bearded guy with laurels in his hair is Shakespeare.  He's not showing any demonstrable connection between Gerard and Shakespeare.  (for instance, Shakespeare isn't mentioned on Gerard's ODNB article).  He doesn't even seem to be entertaining other possibilities as to who the figure could be.  For example, maybe it is this guy:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/Mr_Hackler/status/600750055117574145\n\n(follow me or something if you want)\n\nThat guy, as one of my friends put it, is an 8/10 likeness for the bearded figure in question.  Oh, what's that you say?  That's a portrait of the book's author, John Gerard?  Well... oh, that portrait appears on the twelfth opening of the book in question?  Well that's certainly not going to get anyone an interview with Country Magazine.\n\nOh silly literary historians.  Turning pages to find simpler explanations...  but this some of the laziest MAJOR DISCOVERY 400 YEARS work I've ever seen.\n\nedit: just for clarification, I'm not claiming that the figure is Gerard, I'm just pointing out how a much more likely candidate can be found without resorting to secret codes and unlikely conclusions.  I'm skeptical that the figure is of anyone at all.  It's much more likely just a generic caricature or allegorical representation.\n\nedit again:\n\n------------------\n\nRule 5 is really tough on this, because this is such a spurious claim about the past that it barely qualifies as history - maybe bad historiography? - but I'll give you all a quotation to show why this is amazingly stupid:\n\n&gt;Botanist and historian Mark Griffiths reveals in this week’s issue of Country Life magazine, out tomorrow (May 20), how he cracked a many-layered Tudor code and revealed the living face of Shakespeare for the first time, on the title page of The Herball by John Gerard, a 16th century book on plants, 400 years after it was first published.\nRead more at http://www.countrylife.co.uk/features/world-exclusive-the-true-face-of-shakespeare-revealed-for-the-first-time-video-72243#UATMH3WcSO2o89jl.99 \n\n(read more if you dare - the other quotations come from the embedded video)\n\n* His overall claims and evidence, albeit still secret are based on an arcane semiotics that he has (yet) shown even exists.\n\n* As if that's not bad enough, he puts the cart before the horse when drawing conclusions about the finding, stating (in the video) that it shows Shakespeare had connections with the powerful and the influential people in Elizabethan England (\"a fundamental new way of thinking about Shakespeare\").  This especially the bad historiography part, because that should be a major question in his research, rather than a conclusion drawn: can it be demonstrated that Shakespeare had any relationship with Gerard, let alone one substantial enough to earn a likeness on the frontispiece of his major work?\n\n* To elaborate on why that's a bad claim, the Botanist and the interviewer gush a bit about how Shakespeare was \"The most famous of Englishmen.\"  Well, in 1597 he sure wasn't.  Then, he was a successful comedian and writer of history plays, but he certainly wasn't any superstar of any Elizabethan literary scene.  The leaves on his head are presumably laurels, but Shakespeare was never \"a laureate.\"  Theatre wasn't dignified.  That it even had value was debated (see Sidney's *Apology for Poetry*).  Tragedy was the higher theatrical form, because it served the greatest moralist purpose, but Shakespeare had yet to establish himself as a tragic dramatist.  \n\n* * He had actually written only one tragedy by this point in his career, *Titus Andronicus*, a play which is so loathed by many Bardolaters (such as T. S. Eliot) that attempts have been made to expel from the canon, because some feel it is so bad that Shakespeare couldn't have possibly written it.  I actually like it.  Anyway, it was a popular play in its own day, but not the kind of thing that would have gotten him any aristocratic praise or laurels.  His history cycle was yet complete, and the more famous of his Roman plays were yet to come, let alone his great tragedies..  In other words, Shakespeare may have been well known, but he wasn't any kind of famous superstar.  This is one of those places where no evidence that he was widely beloved exists, and so it falls on someone who thinks otherwise to bring some evidence to the table that Shakespeare was highly regarded in 1597, and we're back to the previous question.\n\n* Anyway, the most famous poet in England at this time was Edmund Spenser, author of *The Fairie Queene*,  [Incidentally the portrait also resembles him](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Edmund_Spenser_oil_painting.JPG).  If the figure is an image of a real person and a poet, he is a more likely candidate.  Spenser was Laureate, and he had a real (instead of imaginary) connection to Cecil (he dedicated a poem to him in *The Faerie Queene*), one of the other three figures that the Botanist claims is represented on the book's cover.\n\n* That what looks like a tiny copper plate frontispiece illustration of a generic bearded man could be conclusively hailed as \"the living face of Shakespeare\" is pretty ludicrous in itself, even if it turns out to be somehow true.  That face looks like nobody's face, if we're looking for verisimilitude.",

        "text": "Let me start by saying that I'm not a big fan of Mental Floss and other trivia sites. I respect John Green as an author (even though I wouldn't read his books) but I always wished he'd stay away from history. This is one of the reasons why.\n\n[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nc9YpQ42wlI&amp;feature=youtu.be), titled \"26 Little Things That Changed History Forever - mental_floss List Show (Ep. 234)\", is exactly what you imagine it to be. It is absolutely filled with bad history and dubious interpretation of things \"some historians claim\".\n\nI will be dealing with one \"fact\" in particular: \n\n\"fact\" 6 - \"**Six U.S. bombers were LATE to the Bay of Pigs**\".\n\nJohn Green: *\"In 1961, John F. Kennedy sent six American B-26s to the Bay of Pigs to help out with the Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba. They ended up showing an hour late and were shot down. Most historians believe that they were confused by the shift in time-zones.\"*\n\nNow, this so-called 'fact' is incorrect. In fact, it's a mish-mash of different things that happened. Despite that and while I understand that this is supposed to be some sort of quick-fire 'here's a fact thrown at you' thingy, I can't see how this event changed \"history forever\".\n\nBut let's take a closer look, shall we?\n\nAt first, I was uncertain of what was referenced. JFK did not authorize to send any B-26s to the Bay of Pigs during the invasion. The CIA, however, did and I imagine that it is this event (which took place on April 18) and an event that took place the following day that has somehow been combined into one, false fact.\n\nThe first event took place on April 18, 1961, D-Day + 1 (that is, a day after the invasion started). By this time, the Cuban and American invasion force on the invasion beaches were facing counterattack by ground forces as well as strafing by the Cuban air force. The situation looked more critical by the hour and while the invasion force did have fire support in the form of several B-26B Invader's, the pilots were already exhausted after almost non-stop sorties. The CIA made the choice to send six B-26s from the CIA airfield in Puerto Cabezas, Nicaragua to Red Beach (Playa Larga) to assist the force. These B-26 were not late, not send by the JFK nor were they confused by time-zones. They arrived, they spotted a convoy of tanks and other members of the Cuban Armed Forces and decided to act. Two of the B-26s attacked the convoy, trapping it between the destroyed lead vehicle and the last vehicle in the convoy. Professor Howard Jones tells us what happened next: \"The convoy immobilized, all six B-26s repeatedly battered the chaotic mass with bombs, rockets, machine guns, and napalm, destroying seven tanks and twenty troop-filled trucks while inflicting eighteen hundred casualties and leaving two miles of smoke and fire burning upward.\" No B-26s were lost.\n\nThe second event took place on April 19, when the situation was so critical that an evacuation had already been authorized. Blue Beach in particular was facing a very serious threat and requested air support and cover in form of jets. JFK, at the time, was still concerned with being able to claim plausible deniability and was not prepared to get involved. However, JFK changed his mind and approved it early on the morning of the 19th with the condition that they would be used to defend transports (to evacuate the beaches) and B-26s (not authorized by the president, already available) *without hitting ground targets or seeking combat*. The B-26s left Puerto Cabezas on time and when they arrived at their planned rendezvous with the jets, they were nowhere to be seen. Pressing on, the bombers reached the landing beaches two B-26s were shot down. The jet support still hadn't arrived. As the B-26s, most of them damaged, made their way back to Puerto Cabezas, the jets from the *USS Essex* finally arrived on the scene - an hour after they should have made the rendezvous. Indeed, when the time was set for the rendezvous for the jets from the *USS Essex*, they had forgotten that Nicaragua was in a different time-zone than Cuba. \n\nSo, there you have it. While the idea that \"most historians believe that they were confused by the shift in time-zones\" is correct, perhaps Mr. Green (or whatever Mental Floss genius who wrote the script) should have actually *read* those historians before he mangled actual events into one visibly false \"fact\". \n\nSources:\n\n*The Bay of Pigs* by Howard Jones (Oxford University Press, 2008)\n\n*The Bay of Pigs: Cuba 1961* by Alejandro de Quesada (Osprey Publishing, 2009)\n\nFull disclosure: This was originally written for /r/AskHistorians and resubmitted here since it was simply too good to pass up.",

It has its basis in a off-hand quote from Lord Clive, that when they captured the king and brought him to the capital in \"chains\" , people just stood by. He also commented if people decided to throw merely stones, The British Army would have been obliterated. It can be argued that it's a propaganda aimed at establishing King's unpopularity.\n\nBecause we can find evidence that even the beneficiaries of the East India Company refused to help during the king's 1756 Calcutta Raid:\n\n&gt; A council of war met at Fort William. It was suggested that the fort alone should be defended and that all the British houses surrounding the fort should be blown up to allow an unrestricted fire on the Nawab’s troops. But the idea was rejected. The prevailing view seems to have been that Siraj would not really go through with his threats in the face of determined opposition from the British. 40 Instead, to deter the Nawab’s advance, the bamboo and straw huts of the Indian residents of Gobindapur were set on fire, and then looters plundered Bara Bazar.41 Drake, the governor, noted later that, except for Gobindaram Mitra, a prominent Indian in the company’s service, no one in the native part of town offered any help: “They are such a niggardly race of people that we gained no assistance or strength to the place from any of those whose great-great-grandfathers had enjoyed the protection of our flag under which they accumulated what they are now possessed of. \"\n\nSource: Chatterjee, Partha.

Historians have rabidly attacked the Great Man Theory for over a century now. It has even gotten to the point that historians write [reflective pieces](http://historynewsnetwork.org/blog/153199) questioning whether or not we've gone *overboard* in our spite of Carlyle's theory. BTW, to quote from that article:\n\n\"Of course outside the circle of professional historians the \"great man\" theory never died. It's as alive, vibrant, and probably even dominant as ever. Just browse the history shelves at any big, popular bookstore. Then go over to the biography section and notice that it's almost as big as the history section.\"\n\n[Forbes Magazine](http://www.nationalreview.com/article/376251/great-man-theory-dead-white-male-criticism-theory-dennis-prager) even accuses historians of being anti-american white-man-hating elitist (?) idiots because of *the century long tradition* of dismantling Great Man narratives and replacing them with more democratic and inclusive approaches (that article is entirely its *own* Bad History, but I digress).\n\nTL:DR--Perhaps the most clueless claim I have ever read regarding the state of the historical profession.

        "text": "Helloooo ladies and gentlemen. Today we got a special event in the /r/history thread titled \"What do you think is the most interesting event in history.\" We'll be ignoring most of the thread however because we got one little corner which is worth our interest! A top comment stating:\n\n&gt; [It's not a singular event, but WWI is the most interesting war in world history, imo. It was one of the bloodiest wars in history, and it was one with several different causes. WWI is also the first major war you see machine guns, trench warfare, and chemical warfare. It's also interesting to note that WWII was a direct result of WWI, and we're still seeing some of the aftermath of WWII today with all the tension between Israel and Palestine. WWI doesn't get nearly as much attention as WWII does, but I think it's more interesting of a war.](http://np.reddit.com/r/history/comments/366spx/what_do_you_think_is_the_most_interesting_event/crbcgda)\n\nThat's right fellas we're on a WWI hateboner train and your captain today will be yours truly. Let's get started as I tear through this comment thread piece by piece.\n\n&gt; Not a historian, but I thought the draconian measures forced on Germany by the Versailles treaty caused a depression in Germany, making many middle-class Germans feel they were being pushed into the under-class. This, in its turn, made many of them more willing to accept Hitler when he provided jobs, a renewed sense of national pride, and some convenient scapegoats to blame the problems on.\n\n--\n\n&gt; The Treaty of Versailles. It directly produced the economic fallout in Germany that was responsible for the rise of Hitler and WWII.\n\n--\n\n&gt; The treaty of Versailles was so bad that it effectively caused a 2nd war.\n\nThis just keeps freaking popping up. /u/rdjvesey absolutely crushes it putting far more effort than I'd ever dream of putting into it. However here's the cliffnotes: \n\nThe measures enforced on Germany were by no means \"draconian\". The 'depression' that Germany suffered (not even close to being one) from '19 to '23 was 100%, totally and utterly, self inflicted by the absolute shitshow that was their finance ministry's handling of the war; to put it short for all you non-WWI historians out there the Germans thought the war would be over in a few weeks and never quite got off that economic mindset. By wars end over 90% of their budget was dedicated to paying interest payments on loans (France had 4, Britain had 3....Germany had 9) and their economy was already in the shitter. This disaster waiting to happen was pushed over the edge when they decided to have absolutely zero intent of acting in good faith w.r.t. Versailles and deliberately sabotaging their own economy to get the reparations slashed (which worked). This is well documented historical fact well accounted by Sally Marks' fantastic work *The Myths of Reparations* if you have JSTOR access.\n\nThis also brings up a really important fact: That the German people did not spite Versailles; they spited *that they lost.* Just putting aside the enormous internal propaganda campaign after the war to paint the Generals (who were basically military dictators near the end of the war) as benevolent fighters to the end who were hopelessly stabbed in the back the Germans, as a whole, still believed they were in a winning position. Russia was defeated and they got all of the food from the grain stores of Ukraine to circumvent the blockade and they were still fighting in occupied Belgium. To them, as a *society*, anything that was not the status quo was considered non-acceptable. I really don't know how to emphasize this enough in such a short span of time: It's not that Versailles was rough (it really wasn't anyways) it's that the German society, for a variety of reasons, could not and would not accept defeat in the context of Winter 1918. So this defeat was unfairly pushed onto the backs of those who revolted internally and those who were convenient scapegoats throughout all of history: Bolsheviks and Jews.\n\n&gt; When you consider WWI and WWII to be two separate phases of the same war, a lot of the 20th Century falls into place.\n\n--\n\n&gt; The Tilsit agreement between Napoleon and Emperor Alexander of Russia ended hostilities between them as well, but war commenced again when Alexander breached the conditions of the agreement. Does that mean the Battle of Austerlitz and the Battle of Borodino belong to two different wars?\n\n--\n\n&gt; On the relationship between WWI and WWII, I had a history prof who treated the two wars as a single war with a 20-year armistice.\n\nI mean I guess you could do that...but I don't see why you would. We don't even do that with wars that are actually directly interrelated like, say, the Wars of German Unification or the Napoleonic Wars. Notice something there? War**s**; they are a series of wars that are directly related to each other. We can do that with WWI and WWII; they were the World War**s**but when you call them the same war that's when you start being a friggin fool. I don't even know how anyone can justify this and I don't want to give it anymore time because I feel stupider every second I give it considering that absolutely shitty excuse for an analogy.\n\n\n&gt; Absolutely. German V-1 Technology and their scientists put men on the moon - after the United States scooped them up and poured money into the program. The ME 262/British Meteor lead to jet liner air travel. The atomic program + moon rockets lead to ICBMs which gave rise to computer networks to communicate during a nuclear war. Those networks expanded into the internet.\n\nOutta fuckin nowhere. I'll leave this to the WWII history buffs. Paging /u/BritainOpPlsNerf, we need you in the ER.\n\n&gt; Let's not forget this is the first time tanks and planes are used militarily. The colt 1911 gets its first real test of duty as well.\n\nJust throwing this one as an aside because of how humorous I find it lol. Oh yeah tanks and planes were used for the first time in combat; two of the most influential tools of war probably ever invented next to the firearm itself....and an American issued sidearm. All in the same category. Just a chortle out of me is all.\n\n----\n\nOh shit didn't see a part 2 coming did you? Turns out /r/history can't get off it.\n\n&gt; [The first Christmas of WW1 when soldiers had a cease fire and got out of their trenches to exchange gifts and play soccer. The next day they went back to killing eachother](http://np.reddit.com/r/history/comments/366spx/what_do_you_think_is_the_most_interesting_event/crbg494)\n\nY'know; lemme just hit this from an ideological standpoint real fast. I don't get the fascination with the Christmas Truce, as a whole, even if it was what they perceive it to be as some frontwide event between all Franco-Anglo-German soldiers. To quote the wonderful /u/NMW on respect to this topic he truly mimics my view of this:\n\n&gt; I believe that gestures of shared humanity between people who don't want to be there and who have perfectly secure homes elsewhere are almost obscene when they're exchanged in the smoking ruins of hundreds of villages that were raped, pillaged and destroyed. Because there was no truce for the hundreds of thousands of French and Belgian civilians forced to \"celebrate\" their Christmases with nothing in refugee camps or hostels or even ditches on the side of the road, assuming they were even still alive.\n\n&gt; One and a half million people in Belgium alone were put to flight and stripped of all the wealth and comfort and possessions they had built up over generations -- and these are just the ones that escaped being forced into labor details, or sent to prison camps, or even being executed outright for the purposes of Schrecklichkeit.\n\n&gt; The men of the German army had one job: to win the war as quickly as possible, force the capitulation of France and Belgium, and re-establish productive and peaceful existence in the territories they would conquer. The men of the Allied armies had one job: to drive the Germans back across the borders they had violated and see to it that they did not return.\n\n&gt; Playing football in No Man's Land in the midst of burnt farms, spoiled crops, shattered churches, stolen livestock and murdered children doesn't really *inspire* me. Even if it is Christmas.\n\nIt's absolutely mindboggling to me. These people were going around executing priests and elderly and burning down villages for perceived slights one day and now they're the literal personification of the futility of war and soldiers who didn't want to be there and such. What? How in the everliving crap? To me the Christmas Truce has always been a perversion; that the 'professional' soldiers of the BEF and the soldiers of the German Imperial army could just get up and play football with eachother like nothing else happened after tearing apart two foreign nations in which they were fighting. It's a perversion of war being a honorable and gentlemanly duty and that the soldiers of either side can just put things aside and fuck around for a bit in the midst of their destruction. \n\nOkay we're getting personal; let's get to the history stuff though.\n\n----\n\n&gt; They sang carols to each other across no mans land as well. It was so distressing to the high commands of both sides that they set in place procedures ensuring it never happened again.\n\n- \n\n&gt; When the generals found out about it, they put a stop to the fraternization in a hurry, on both sides.\n\nWell I mean...why wouldn't they? This type of crap is always said whenever the Christmas Truce is talked about and it's always like it's this stupendously drastic measure that \"the Generals\" unfairly imposed upon the soldiers. This also comes with the implication that, as a whole, the front stopped fighting on Christmas when in reality it was a very small segment. \n\n&gt; This is incredibly awesome, if only the war ended because of this truce.\n\n-- \n\n&gt; That is not completely true, many many soldiers had to be replaced with reserves and transferred because they were unwilling to fight the people they just played football with\n\nAgain; no possible way that was possible; this is the most overstated event and overly romanticized thing ever. It happened on a very small portion of the front in a very limited manner. The Prussians, French, and Belgians had absolutely no well wishes of those on the other side of the trenches. They all still had a lot to settle on the battlefield and the British weren't going anywhere either in the form of ~500,000 men signing up for combat before September's end on the home Isles alone.\n\n&gt; [W.R.T. the Rape of Belgium] You do realize the German soldiers were following orders, just like the Allied forces, right? I'm sure they were fed propaganda and they thought the Allied forces were the evil ones. Maybe for one day, the soldiers realized they were pretty similar; they were fighting for their country and following orders. If they didn't, they could be charged with treason and sentenced to death. The soldiers weren't all that different on each side; just kids doing what they were told. Obviously, it's a different story for those in charge. But at the bottom? Not so different.\n\nTo quote myself just in the thread: 150,000 German soldiers deserted and *48* were executed. The British captured about ~20,000 who deserted either through abandoning their post, refusing to fight, or some other nonsense and about around 5,000 were sentenced to death and 306 were actually shot; so even if *you were literally sentenced to death* you had less than a 1% chance of actually being shot. This myth that if you chose not to fight or if you deserted you would instantly be shot in the back is just so hilariously misguided it's barely worth addressing at this point. \n\nThere's always this idea of removing human agency in these things and it's bullocks. Yes there was mass conscription but that mass conscription came with overwhelming positive reaction; even the freaking anti-war socialists were providing unilaterial support for the war in Germany and only 1.2% of those conscripted failed to report for duty in France. Yes men were given orders to fight but they enthusiastically carried it out. They were pumped full of ghost stories of the mythical francs-tireurs, yes, and that sent them into a hizzy during the Belgian campaign but \"being a kid\" doesn't excuse one from shooting a dozen priests, elderly, women, and children in a street and indiscriminately tossing grenades into windows to preemptively clear a town. Which they did. Regularly. \n\n\n&gt;&gt; The French were being invaded. The Belgians were being invaded. The British were off defending those who they swore to protect the neutrality of and who were being unnecessarily invaded. They knew why they were there quite more than any war ever before.\n\n&gt; That's an oversimplification. Do you know why the Germans invaded? Because France declared war on Austria-Hungary...\n\nLiterally what. Literally what in the ever living fuck is this shit. No France did not declare war on Austria-Hungary thus causing Germany to invade. Holy tap dancing Christ on a Cracker kill me now because I'm getting the death penalty anyways for what I'm finna do. This is so hilariously obscenely wrong *and it's being upvoted.* When I checked this morning (which prompted this BH post) I was at -1 and he was at +5; it blew my fucking mind. This is objectively not true I don't know any other way to say this; it's as wrong as if someone said that Britain declared war on Germany in 1939 so Germany invaded Poland to defend her border. It's so conclusively and overwhelmingly incorrect I don't even know what to do. \n\nThis is the progress things took, piece by piece:\n\n* Germany gives Austria the infamous **\"Blank Check\"** giving her total freedom to do whatever she wanted with Serbia with Germany's promised support. This was done with full knowledge that Serbia was under Russia's protection and it meant war. \n\n* Austria moves its troops to the Serbian border and sends them an ultimatum that would strip Serbia of her sovereignty. Serbia is given a 48 hour time limit and is told it must accept every bit of the ultimatum or war will occur. \n\n* Serbia begins mobilizing in response\n\n* Austria-Hungary mobilizes\n\n* Russia tells Serbia to back off and accept the ultimatum. Serbia does. The only stipulation is that they want the Hague to do the investigation into the assassination rather than the kangaroo court that was Vienna.\n\n* **Austria responds by shelling Belgrade on July 28th, 1914. WWI begins.**\n\n* Russia begins a **partial mobilization** which means it is only mobilizing with respect to Austria-Hungary **and not Germany or on German borders.** \n\n* Russia, operating on false intel the Germans were mobilizing as well (granted Willhelm II outright said in response to Nicholas that he was partially mobilizing that they must too themselves), begins full mobilization\n\n* Britain declares that it will back Belgian sovereignty in accordance with the Treaty of London 1839\n\n* France and Germany order general mobilization near simultaneously (ten minutes within each other)\n\n* France withdraws her forces over 20 miles from the border as to not instigate Germany.\n\n* **Germany declares war on Russia.**\n\n* **Germany declares war on France.**\n\n* **Germany invades neutral Belgium.**\n\n* **Britain maintains promise of Belgian neutrality and declares war on Germany.**\n\n* **Austria-Hungary declares war on Russia and France.**\n\nFrance did not declare war first and it *certainly* was not with respect to Austria-Hungary. The reality of the treaties is that Germany and France,  together, had every opportunity to stay out of the conflict in the same way that Italy did. Austria engaged hostilities with an ally of Russia; it was not a defensive war thus Germany was not obligated to her defense. Russia was not being invaded she was coming to the aid of an ally w.r.t. Austria when their treaty with France was w.r.t., primarily, German invasion but most of all a defensive war. France was not obligated to come to her aid. \n\n*Germany* invaded France because their policy, both diplomatic and militarily, was based on the preemptive strike. If they were at risk of war they *had* to strike first (or so they perceived) or they would be defeated and that meant striking at France as hard as possible as soon as possible. *Whether or not France actually intended to go to war was utterly irrelevant; they had the POTENTIAL to go to war with Germany and thus had to be neutralized.* That is what is so destructive about the German policy at this time; it removed agency from their counterpart nation-states to avoid war. \n\n&gt; As already stated, this is a huge oversimplification. Although the combat was taking place on French soil, France was by no means innocent, and played a crucial part in instigating the war. The British too had their own interests at stake when they entered into the war. As the war went on there were soldiers on every side who no longer knew why they were fighting, French soldiers even marched on Paris in protest of the war. The First World War was by no means a simple good guy versus bad guy war.\n\nHow in the everliving crap did France \"instigate\" the war, both leading up and in the July Crisis? By ceding colonial territory when *Germany sent a fucking warship to intervene in a French colonial matter*? By doing everything they could to avoid war in Europe through a conciliatory policy in both 1905 and 1911? By simply existing and being allied with Russia? I don't get how they \"instigated\" the war when they withdrew their forces from the border and had no intent of intervening in the Austrian conflict. \n\nIt was not a good guy vs bad guy war but someone started it and that was Austria-Hungary and someone escalated it and that was Germany. The end.\n\n",

Stop \"helping.\"**\n\n**4. Dude, history.**\n\n###So the fuck what?\n\nSeriously, so the fuck what? Picking two arbitrary events (foundings of Tenochtitlan and Oxford University) without context tells us nothing. The idea that Oxford is older than the Aztecs is only interesting because it plays on two biases of the reddit audience. \n\n**First**: the incredibly limited general knowledge of Mesoamerica. \n\nSince the Aztecs are a big marquee name, they are one of the only things that the general population knows about the area (aside from the fact that the Maya were apocalyptic aliens or some shit). Add in that common knowledge about the Aztecs tend to begin and end with the Spanish Conquest, and this can give a false impression that Mesoamerica was completely dominated by a civilization which was ancient, overarching, and toppled by a Spanish dude’s sneeze. In reality, the Aztecs were late, but explosive, arrivals onto the Mesoamerican scene, which itself was diverse and deep-rooted. \n\n**Second**: the idea that American peoples were backward savages, stone age primitives to be pushed aside by Europeans sporting the latest high-tech gadgetry. The collision of whig history with racism, essentially. \n\nLet's examine this through two quotes. The first is from famed scholar of history, [Immortal Technique](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jjp8yuEBjxs):\n\n&gt; I hate it when they tell use how far we came to be/as if our peoples' history started with slavery\n\nThe Americas, like Sub-Saharan Africa, shockingly have a depth of history that does not involve Europeans whatsoever. Since the compressed narrative of history education tends towards *White People: Greatest Hits*, the fact that humans have been living in the Americas for thousands of years and Africa since... forever, and that these people did stuff, tends to get elided over. \n\nWhich brings us to our next quote, from the OP of one of those fucking TIL posts:\n\n&gt; [It's nice to be an old-worlder.](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1odh77/til_that_oxford_university_is_older_than_the/ccr3fd4?context=2) \n\nand this sterling example of facepalm:\n\n&gt; [Why did the Aztecs get wiped out by Europeans? Because Europeans built Oxford when Aztecs were making blood sacrifices to the sun god.](http://np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1odh77/til_that_oxford_university_is_older_than_the/ccr8dmz)\n\nThere’s a dirty diaper’s worth of bad history in both of those linked comment threads, but the sentiment is that there is something inherently great about being from Europe, “[where the history comes from.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6hijsqO8H0)” That people from the “Old World” intrinsically have a richer cultural foundation than those people living in the “New World,” and that the relative ages of Oxford and the Aztecs are symbolic of that.\n\nJust to illustrate how inane the idea is that comparing two arbitrary points in history and pretending that tells us anything, here are a few things older than Oxford:\n\n&gt; [Drawing dicks on things](http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2013/01/19/1226557/144620-italy-archaeology-colosseum-frescoes.jpg)\n\n&gt; [The Assyrians](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flaying#The_Assyrian_tradition)\n\n&gt; [Rhinoplasty](http://journals.lww.com/annalsplasticsurgery/Abstract/2014/07000/Sushruta__Father_of_Plastic_Surgery.2.aspx)\n\n&gt; Your mom\n\nAnd a few things newer than the Aztecs:\n\n&gt; [The KFC Famous Bowl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfan5MacmsI)\n\n&gt; [Antibiotics](http://www.nature.com/nrmicro/journal/v9/n12/abs/nrmicro2693.html)\n\n&gt; [The German Civilization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unification_of_Germany)\n\nWhat does this motley collection of disparate things tell us? How does it educate us? \n\nNot a fucking thing and it doesn’t. It’s just random facts.\n\nBut, wait, I hear my sharp reading Teutons saying, how is the “German Civilization” younger than the Aztecs? More on that in a bit, but let’s move on to the next point. \n\n###What’s an Aztec?\n\nThe political entity the Spanish encountered in 1520 did not call themselves the Aztecs. The idea that there was an “Empire” that was “Aztec” is as misguided as the idea that there was a Holy Roman Empire, despite the latter being neither holy nor Roman nor an empire. These are are terms we anachronistically ascribe to groups in order to understand them from our modern lens.\n\nThe reality is the group in Postclassic Central Mexico did not identify themselves by our modern ideas of nation-states. Instead, local affiliation was more prevalent and the anachronistic character of the term was [identified solidly in 1945](http://www.jstor.org/stable/978159). Simply put, there was no singular people called “Aztec,” and thus no such thing as an Aztec Empire. Instead there was a trio of Nahua groups who came together in the early 1400s to establish a mutually beneficial political arrangement that is more precisely (but still etically) called the “Aztec Triple Alliance.” For a breakdown of “Nahua” and “Aztec,” I’ll point you towards [this comment](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/33q4ye/what_exactly_is_the_difference_between_nahua/cqnqyjt) in /r/AskHistorians on the subject and I also discuss the idea on an episode of the [AskHistorians Podcast](http://askhistorians.libsyn.com/askhistorians-podcast-033-aztecs-tenochtitlan-tlatelolco). \n\nThe point is that Nahua peoples -- an overarching ethnolinguistic group -- had inhabited Central Mexico for centuries before what we now call the  Aztec Empire, which was merely the latest in series of dominant or semi-dominant Nahua polities. Arbitrarily picking the extant example of these Nahua states at the time of European contact and using it as a comparison point to Oxford is like making the unification of Germany in 1871 the arbitrary point for establishing the “German civilization.” It ignores cultural continuity going back centuries.\n\n###Stop \"helping.\"\n\nTo be fair, every time this farting factoid poots out upon TIL, this oversight gets pointed out. Unfortunately, most of the people trying to spread some knowledge, while earnest, don’t know what they fuck they are talking about. Take this adorable soul:\n\n&gt; [the Aztec Empire was built on top of the previous Olmec Empire going back to 1200 BC](http://np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/30m6bl/til_that_oxford_university_is_at_least_400_years/cptohsi)\n\nI appreciate they are making the effort to establish that history does not easily lend itself to stop and start points, but this is so wrong I want to [pierce my tongue with a maguey spine](http://www.mexicolore.co.uk/images-3/358_02_2.jpg) (or possibly a stingray barb as a shout out to the Olmec lowland tradition).\n\nLet’s get this out of the way right now: there was no such thing as an “Olmec Empire.” The insistence on referring to them as such reflect an anachronistic viewpoint grounded in the modern idea of objectively defined and delineated states. \n\nThe Olmecs were a cultural group in the area of present day southern Veracruz and Tabasco (the “Olmec Heartland”), which were the among the earliest groups to urbanize into complex stratified societies in Mesoamerica. There were important cities, and their influence was important and widespread throughout Mesoamerica, but we don’t see evidence of anything we would define as an “empire.” The general notion is their influence spread culturally and artistically, not through military domination (though this does not mean they were pacifistic hippies).\n\nAlso, while the Olmecs are tremendously important in understanding the development of urbanized, stratified societies in Mesoamerica, there may be a *small* amount of time between the fluorescence of the Olmecs and the founding of Tenochtitlan; like about 2000 years worth of time. \n\nAll this gets called out in a response to that helpful, but misguided, comment:\n\n&gt; Your history is analogous to saying Napoleon built his empire on top of the previous Roman Empire.\n\nExcept that France actually was part of a Roman Empire. Also there was a Roman Empire. Again, the Olmec influence was more like a combination of influence, inspiration, and imitation, not conquest. We never see anything like an overarching unified Olmec state extending into Central Mexico. So this is more like saying Rome built its empire on top of 4th Dynasty Egypt. After all, it’s common knowledge that the founding of Rome upon hills was a symbolic replication of the Pyramids of Khufu. Or something.\n\nIn fact, this defense of the roots of the Aztecs is so wrong we’re going to have to move into the next section of this post.\n\n###Dude, History.\n\nWe’ve established that making a connection between the Aztecs and the Olmecs is a long walk, figuratively and literally (several hundred miles, by the way the quetzal flies). That leaves a large gulf of understanding though, and as well all know, those gulfs tend to be filled with ignorance. \n\n&lt;fredrogers&gt; Let’s build a bridge of knowledge instead. &lt;/fredrogers&gt;\n\nOne thing to establish early on is the existence of multiple loci of cultures who were variably influenced by the Olmecs. While the early and persistent idea of the Olmecs as *La Cultura Madre* has no small amount of truth, the reality is that while the founding of San Lorenzo around 1200 BCE signified the onset of complex, stratified societies in Mesoamerica, the spread of Olmec culture throughout the region was one of constant adaptation by local groups. \n\nThe most significant and independent area of development was the Valley of Mexico. Contemporary with the Olmecs, we see the development of “primary” settlements: larger villages surrounded by smaller satellite communities. Showing influence from the Olmecs, but also an independent artistic style, Tlatilco is probably the best known, but the contemporary site of Cuicuilco would surpass it later.\n\nBy the Middle Formative (600-300 BCE), [Cuicuilco](http://www.zonaarqueologica.com.mx/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/cuicuilco-zona-arqueologica.jpg) (monumental architecture shown, because that how you know you've got a civilization right?) had grown into a small city of 10-20K people and was a major center in an area rapidly filling with large settlemts. As we progress forward in time it gained a rival in the Valley of Mexico with the growth of Teotihuacan. Ashfalls from the Popocatépetl volcano between 250 BCE and 50 CE, followed by a subsequent eruption the Xitle volcano, however, led to the abandonment of the site and it being buried by a lava flow. Most of the population is thought to have migrated northward to Teotihuacan.\n\nBy this time, we’ve reached the early Classic (~250 CE), and [Teotihuacan](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d3/Teotihuac%C3%A1n.jpg) has grown to a megacity of 100K people and is still growing. The influence of Teotihuacan was felt across Mesoamerica and even into the Maya region, particularly with the city of [Tikal](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c5/Tikal-Plaza-And-North-Acropolis.jpg). By about 600 CE, however, the great city went into a sharp decline, with major parts being abandoned and only a shadow of the population remaining. \n\nThe Late Classic/Epiclassic period that followed saw the rise of several centers outside the Valley, like [Cholula](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Pyramid_of_Cholula) and [Xochicalco](https://www.google.com/search?q=xochicalco&amp;es_sm=122&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1uZXVfDBN8GaNpzggMAN&amp;ved=0CAcQ_AUoAQ&amp;biw=1680&amp;bih=925#imgrc=OvzsUkFNLEa6pM%253A%3BrG-vFvtnpF1dQM%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fupload.wikimedia.org%252Fwikipedia%252Fcommons%252F0%252F0b%252FXochicalco_35.jpg%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fcommons.wikimedia.org%252Fwiki%252FFile%253AXochicalco_35.jpg%3B3280%3B2460). North of the Valley saw the most relevant to our discussion successor state, the Toltecs. Forming out of Nahua groups moving south out of the Chichimec wilds and the displaced Nonoalca moving inland from the Gulf coast, they established the city of Tula in the power vacuum left behind by the Teotihuacan collapse.\n\nBy its apogee between 900-1150 CE, [Tula](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/48/Tula.jpg) was a metropolis of around 60K person with a broad swathe of satellite villages. Its power extended directly across northern Central Mexico, but reached as far as the Yucatán with Chichen Itza showing evidence of Toltec influence.\n\nThe downfall of the Toltec coincided with the influx of new Nahua groups from the north, who integrated with existing settlements and founded new ones, including Azcapotzalco, established not far from where Tlatilco once flourished. Under the multi-decade rule of Tezozomoc, the Nahua Tepanecs, extended their rule around the lakeshore of Lake Texcoco. Included in their dominion were the Mexica at Tenochtitlan, who would later spearhead a revolt to overthrow Azcapotzalco's dominance, seize its lands, and set up the Aztec Triple Alliance. All while the Mexica established their ties back to the Toltecs, who were a successor state to Teotihuacan, which had its roots 1000 years back. \n\nDo you get the point?\n\nThis complex succession was the cultural context which gave rise to the Aztec Triple Alliance. It was not some blank slate waiting to be written. It was not a direct line from the “Olmec Empire” to the “Aztec Empire.” It was a complicated background spanning thousands of years. We see a continuity of Mesoamerican so evident that Covarraubias has charted the [evolution](http://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/data/13030/36/ft7x0nb536/figures/ft7x0nb536_00104.gif) of the rain/water god Tlaloc from its early Olmec context across multiple different regions. Blithely noting that Tenochtitlan was founded after Oxford not only tells us nothing, but actively obfuscates the historical context which led to the founding of both the university and the city.\n\n**tl;dr:** this post comes up on average every 53 days (std dev of 46 days) and each time it makes you less smart.",

But you only need a cursory glance to see that Mao had an education that included a great deal western scholarship. (Not that this is the essence of enlightenment, I'm just working within his narrow definitons)\n\n&gt;Studying independently, he spent much time in Changsha's library, reading core works of classical liberalism such as Adam Smith's The Wealth of Nations and Montesquieu's The Spirit of the Laws, as well as the works of western scientists and philosophers such as Darwin, Mill, Rousseau, and Spencer.[31] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mao_Zedong?wprov=sfii1\n\nThere is of course plenty more bad history in this comment to deconstruct.

But the \"gold standard\" bad guy debate always bores me, I just wanted to point out the lazy racism. \n\nSome more goodies from the thread\n\n&gt;While this is the reason, I would actually have to argue that the Kim dynasty is more evil because they are so Orwellian: Hitler, deluded as he was, at least thought he was doing the world and Germany a favor. The Kim's, on the other hand, do nothing but shamelessly reinforce their own power, \"the Party seeks power entirely for its own sake.\"\n\n&gt;&gt;I'm not one for playing the \"this dictatorship is worse than this other one\" game, but I agree.

        "text": "Not as problematic as most things we see here, but a few things about [this article from the guardian, which promotes the idea that hunter-gather societies were equal between genders](http://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/may/14/early-men-women-equal-scientists?CMP=soc_567) rubs me the wrong way.  This is based on the work of a bunch of scientists and anthropologists, but note that I'm not criticising the science they use, which I think is mostly quite solid, but the assumptions they make from their conclusions.\n\nFirstly the opening paragraph\n\n&gt;Our prehistoric forebears are often portrayed as spear-wielding savages, but the earliest human societies are likely to have been founded on enlightened egalitarian principles, according to scientists.\n\nWhy does this need to be a contradiction?  Even if they were egalitarian, they still were pre-agriculture, spear wielding hunters with no knowledge of writing, humanities, science or medicine.  It really shows that the Guardian is starting hard down the path of noble savage.\n\n&gt;A study has shown that in contemporary hunter-gatherer tribes, men and women tend to have equal influence on where their group lives and who they live with. \n\nTwo big things here.  Firstly, the data is entirely based on *contemporary hunter-gatherer tribes*.  Now while this may certainly inform our understanding of their social structures, it is only to an extent.  I'll touch a bit more on this later.  Also a bit of a nitpick here, but this seems to be the basis for the claim of them being egalitarian.  However this is only one decision regarding the future of a tribe, so it's a bit of stretch to claim that if men and women were equal regarding this decision that they were equal in absolutely all decisions.\n\n&gt;Dyble says the latest findings suggest that equality between the sexes may have been a survival advantage and played an important role in shaping human society and evolution.\n\nI feel this is supposed to be a subtle dig against the history of patriarchy in post-agricultural societies.\n\n&gt;The scientists collected genealogical data from two hunter-gatherer populations, one in the Congo and one in the Philippines\n\nThis may be my only big criticism with the data, but considering the modern day lack of hunter-gatherer populations, it may have been unavoidable.  Both of these tribes come from tropical environments.  This means the study has a very very limited perspective of the social structures of all prehistoric hunter-gatherer societies.  In climates with less vegetation and fruit there would be much more chance that the hunting males would be the dominant and relied upon gender in the society.\n\nAn ultimately this is my big problem with this piece.  There were so so many different hunter-gatherer societies and we know precious little about any of them.  To make a generalization so broad to say they were egalitarian based on two modern day tribes from similar climates is considerably overstepping.  What this data does prove is that hunter-gatherer tribes had the **potential** to be egalitarian, especially in the questions regarding movement and inclusion, but that's the limit.\n\nAnd at the end of the day this is just the Guardian pandering to the Noble Savage myth, which is so problematic.  On one hand it seems to promote the idea that humans \"naturally\" are equal between genders, but on the other hand the problem with basing it on this myth is pandering to the belief that civilization \"corrupted\" this natural egalitarianism.  This seems especially problematic because it has been modern civilization which has provided the means for feminism to take root and for women to take equal part in society (e.g. mandatory education).  I do like the Guardian, but it really has a problematic slant to promoting leftist causes in fields it inadequately understands.\n\nNote: If I've made any errors regarding my statements on science or anthropology, feel free to correct me.  I made this post primarily to correct the historical generalizations made in the article.",

        "text": "In [my previous post](http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/34yrn9/wikipedias_article_on_aristarchus_of_samos/) on the Aristarchus of Samos Wikipedia page I kinda threw in a *blink-and-you-miss-it* reference to how goddamed awful is [the 2nd](http://solar-center.stanford.edu/FAQ/Qsunasstar.html) of the few secondary sources used by the article, the first one being the never ***un***praised enough Draper.\n\nIn fact, \"goddamed awful\" is an understatement, and I think it fully deserves a /r/badhistory treatment. There's pretty much no period that comes clean, so I'll have to reproduce the full text. I'm sorry the result is way long, but trust me, it is a never ending source of bewilderment.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt;## [Who discovered that the Sun was a star?](http://solar-center.stanford.edu/FAQ/Qsunasstar.html)\n&gt;*This answer is courtesy of Louis Strous of the National Solar Observatory, Sacramento Peak, NM.*\n\nSo, The Standford Solar Center wants [a FAQ on the Sun](http://solar-center.stanford.edu/resources/#FAQS) with some educational value. Who better than [a professional astronomer later turned software developer](http://aa.quae.nl/en/colofon.html)^don't ^read ^the ^other ^questions, ^it'll ^give ^you ^cancer to write about the history of solar investigations? An historian?! Pffff, what a crazy idea!\n\nFear not, for as [from their website](http://solar-center.stanford.edu/mission.html) (emphases mine):\n\n&gt;Our **award-winning Solar Center website, targeted at 4th-12th grade students and science teachers**, provides inquiry-based activities and a broad range of information relating to the Sun. Solar art, folklore, music, literature, and **archaeoastronomy complement** our scientific information and offer **intriguing multidisciplinary** \"hooks\" into solar study.\n\nWe'll see, we'll see...\n\nSo, let's return to their text by dr. Strous.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\n&gt;Many people's work was needed to prove that the Sun is a star. The first person we know of to suggest that the Sun is a star up close (or, conversely, that stars are Suns far away) was Anaxagoras, around 450 BC. It was again suggested by Aristarchus of Samos, but this idea did not catch on. About 1800 years later, around AD 1590, Giordano Bruno suggested the same thing, and was burnt at the stake for it.\n\n+ It could be interesting to actually realize why the idea \"did not catch up\". For example, stars were no more than innumerable constantly moving little dots of light and saying *\"You know what? See those? See that giant fireball that gives us daylight? They could be the same thing!\"* was already imaginative enough.\n\n+ Also, saying that Anaxagoras and Aristarchus ideas *\"did not catch up\"* and jumping to *\"About 1800 years later\"* makes it look like like some \"giant missed, obscure insight\" in History of Science (do such things actually exist?). Obscure it was not during history, at least for learned men, and all that was missed (for good reasons) was the evidence. For God's sake, let us sit upon the ground and tell sad stories of Nicholas of Cusa writing about this stuff one century before Bruno and being made a freaking Cardinal and Papal Legate after that.\n\n+ Hey, look, it's good ol' Bruno being burned for anything else than being a [crazy, loony, seven years long stubborn burn-me-if-you-can heretic](http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/~pogge/Essays/Bruno.html)! (see also: /u/timoneill piece [Cartoons and Fables – How Cosmos Got the Story of Bruno Wrong](http://armariummagnus.blogspot.com.au/2014/03/cartoons-and-fables-how-cosmos-got.html) ).\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\n&gt;Through the work of Galileo, Kepler, and Copernicus during the 16th and 17th centuries the nature of the solar system and the Sun's place in it became clear, \n\n+ Galileo's work has little to do with it. The importance of his observations is usually way overstated, since pretty much everyone with a telescope [was doing the same](https://thonyc.wordpress.com/2011/01/10/one-day-later/) and he was just very little faster, sometimes just in claiming priority. Even Galileo's astronomical theories were often a mess; think about \"comets are atmosferic reflections\" *Assayer*, refusal of Kepler's ellipses, one tide a day *Dialogo* as proof of Copernicus, sunspots as proof of Copernicus, [Mizar as proof of Copernicus](http://arxiv.org/ftp/physics/papers/0606/0606255.pdf), whatever as proof of Copernicus...\n\n+ Not that any of the three was able of giving proof of heliocentrism (there always was a Tychonic system cinematically equivalent, without parallax and dynamical problems). I am no expert, but I'd say that \"Sun's place\" became clear mostly thanks to Newton and the realization that stellar disks seen in telescopes were spurious (thus stars could be very distant).\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\n&gt;and finally in the 19th century the distances to stars and other things about them could be measured by various people. Only then was it proved that the Sun is a star.\n\n+ **F#ck! The f#cking question was *\"Who discovered that the Sun was a star?\"*, then why the f#ck do you skip the actual answer?!** (HINT: you won't find the answer later)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\n&gt;For most of human history, almost all people have thought that the Earth was in the center of a giant sphere (or ball, called the \"celestial sphere\") with the stars stuck to the inside of the sphere. The planets, Sun, and Moon were thought to move between the sphere of stars and the Earth, and to be different from both the Earth and the stars.\n\n+ *\"For most of human history, almost all people\"*? Seriously? Are we talking about the whole world, a specific nation, a specific tradition of intellectuals or what? What about China?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\n&gt;**Anaxagoras**, who lived in Athens, Greece, around 450 BC (about 2450 years ago), thought that the Sun and stars were fiery stones, that the stars were too far away for their heat to be felt, and that the Sun was perhaps more than a few hundred miles in size. With that Anaxagoras was, as far as we know, the first one to suggest that the Sun is a star. **His ideas were met with disapproval and he was finally imprisoned for impiety, because his ideas did not fit the prejudices of the time**^Emphasis ^mine .\n\n+ Every source I know of talks about exile, not imprisonment (and the process being probably politic, not just religious). Whatever, let's make it look like it was all about the nature of the stars (he was, like, so modern! So modern he considered the Sun a mass of red-hot metal, this is surely what must have gotten on the nerves of the fundies!). Also, *\"because his ideas did not fit the prejudices of the time\"* is a nice touch, an objective, certainly non-prejudiced statement.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\n&gt;**Aristarchus of Samos** (Samos is a Greek island in the Aegean Sea) lived from about 310 to 230 BC, about 2250 years ago. He measured the size and distance of the Sun and, though his observations were inaccurate, found that the Sun is much larger than the Earth. Aristarchus then suggested that the small Earth orbits around the big Sun rather than the other way around, and he also suspected that stars were nothing but distant suns, but his ideas were rejected and later forgotten, and he, too, was threatened for suggesting such things.\nAristarchus and Anaxagoras had no way of actually measuring the sizes of or distances to stars (except the Sun), so they had no proof for their ideas.\n\n+ *\"and he,* ***too***, *was threatened for suggesting such things\"* See? There must have been some sort of Bellarmino Time Lord orchestrating an anti-heliocentrism Spanish Inquisition from the dawn of primates until the great Renaissance Time-War that was his unmaking! Why on Earth should his model have been \"rejected and later forgotten\", if not 'cos fundies? Let's make our best not to distract ourselves with how heliocentrism 1) had only an unprovable assumption to explain lack of parallax 2) was totally inconsistent with a wide range of dynamical effects one expected to notice with that time's \"physics\" by staying on a 150m/s rotating 30 Km/s revolving ball of rock 3) had no way at all to explain how it was that rocky, hugely massive, \"hulking, lazy body, unfit for motion\" of our Earth to move and not those nice figures in the sky.\n\n+ Moreover, all we know is that Cleanthes argued that he ought have been charged with impiety, not that it actually happened. Details, right?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\n&gt;**Claudius Ptolemaeus** (commonly called Ptolemy by speakers of English) of Alexandria (a Greek city in what is now Egypt) around AD 140 (about 1860 years ago) described a geocentric (= earth-centered) model of the universe, with the Earth in the center of the Universe, the Sun as one of the wanderers (\"planetes\" in Greek) that move relative to the stars, and the stars fixed to the outermost celestial sphere. In this model, the stars and the Sun were completely different. The universe described in this book (which book came to be known as the Almagest) was accepted as the truth by practically everybody for the next 14 centuries, mostly because it was endorsed by the Roman Catholic Church, which became very powerful during that time. This model described fairly accurately how planets move, but not why they moved in just that way, and it lumped the Sun together with the planets rather than with the stars.\n\n+ Except that Ptolemy blew everybody's mind centuries before Christianity had any power or even existed. Geez, one would hope that writing down dates could give rise to some doubt...\n\n+ Of course, the author does his best not to explain why everybody endorsed Ptolemy's work (again, parallax, dynamics)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n&gt;**Mikolaj Kopernik** (known as Nicholas Copernicus outside of his native Poland) lived from 1473 to 1543. In 1543, just before he died, he published a book called \"De revolutionibus orbium celestium\" in which he proposed a heliocentric (= sun-centered) solar system with the Sun in the center and the Earth merely one of the planets orbiting the Sun, just like the other ones. This model was simpler than Ptolemy's geocentric model, though either one could be used to predict planetary motion. The model of Copernicus set the Sun apart from the planets, but did not say anything about the stars. Copernicus waited as long as possible before publishing this book because he was afraid the Church would not approve of it. At first, most opposition to his ideas actually came from Protestants, not Catholics. Martin Luther, one of the main early figures in protestantism, declared loudly that Copernicus was a fool for \"setting the Earth in motion\".\n\n+ Now, let's gloss over little details like Copernicus being a cleric. Or having his theory explained to an appreciative Pope. Or getting encouragement in his studies from bishops and at least a cardinal. He got opposition, full stop. What sort of opposition, we'll never know.\n\n+ [Ah, the simple, simpler, simplest Copernican model](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_MUPCNejH0I/UhWIml-2L5I/AAAAAAAAAaU/MTS0EzyPxGY/s1600/Ptolemaic+and+Copernican.jpg).\n\n+ Copernicus didn't wait to publish his book trembling in fear. He had promised a proof of his theory, yet he found none: he couldn't deliver.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\n&gt;**Giordano Bruno**, an Italian philosopher, lived from 1548 to 1600. He decided that if the Earth is a planet just like the others, then it does not make sense to divide the Universe into a sphere of fixed stars and a solar system. He said that the Sun is a star, that the Universe is infinitely large, and that there are many worlds. He was condemned by both the Roman Catholic and Reformed Churches for this as well as other things and was burnt alive in Rome in 1600 for heresy (claiming something that does not fit the ideas accepted by the Church).\n\n+ Giordano Bruno. 'nuff said.\n\n+ Truth to be told, this is one the most amazing \"See? He got Modern Science^TM right!\" pieces I ever met. Our beloved Louis Strous must have never been within a mile from an actual Bruno's work.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\n&gt;**Galileo Galilei**, an Italian scientist, lived from 1564 to 1642. In 1610, he was the first person we know of to use the newly invented telescope to look at the stars and planets. He discovered the satellites of Jupiter, which showed that Ptolemy's and the Church's idea that there was only one center of orbits in the Universe (namely, the Earth) was incorrect. Based on his observations, Galilei argued for the heliocentric model of Copernicus. He noticed that stars look like little points even when seen through a telescope, and concluded that stars must be very far away indeed.\n\n+ While this is a little known fact, [the first one to point a telescope to the heavens was probably Harriot](https://thonyc.wordpress.com/2013/07/05/he-didnt-published-and-so-he-perished-historically/).\n\n+ Given that planets already revolved around epicycles, I see the \"Jupiter's moons\" argument a little weak.\n\n+ *\"Based on his observations, Galilei argued* ***in a lot of incorrect ways*** *for the heliocentric model of Copernicus.\"* FTFY.\n\n+ The idea that Galileo saw stars as points is an [often repeated, patent bulls#it claim by people who didn't actually read his works](http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu//full/2010JHA....41..453G/0000453.000.html).\n\n+ A cool move would have been reporting how, assuming the very hypothesis that stars were just like the Sun, Galileo made a measurement on Mizar intended to prove heliocentrism [that spectacularly blew in his face](http://arxiv.org/ftp/physics/papers/0606/0606255.pdf), prompting him to ~~reconsider geocentrism~~ hide the evidence.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n&gt;In part because Bruno (a convicted heretic) supported them, the ideas of Copernicus were condemned by the Catholic Church in 1616, and Galileo was tried and convicted of heresy in 1633. He was forced to publicly deny the ideas of Copernicus, and was held under house arrest until he died in 1642. In 1979 a reinvestigation of this conviction was started by the Church and finally the conviction was overturned, about 340 years after Galileo's death. A famous story, but perhaps untrue, has Galileo mutter (of the Earth) \"And yet she moves!\" on his death-bed. Yet, Galileo, like Bruno and Aristarchus before him, had no proof that the Sun and stars are alike.\n\n+ TIL that 1) Bruno had a role in Galileo's process. 2) They waited for Galileo to condemn the century old idea that somehow had Bruno killed without being already condemned because... reasons, I suppose. \n\n+ Our historical powerhouse manages to get even *MYTH* wrong. *\"Eppur si muove\"* is attributed to the end of the trial.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Continues in [comment 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/363t6d/who_discovered_that_the_sun_was_a_star/crag8lw) with Kepler, Hyugens, Newton, Bessel and our serious contender for worst astronomer turned amateur historian**\n",

Haven't submitted here before and I still have a ton to learn about history.\n\nThis whole thing is utter nonsense, let alone being rather eurocentric in and of itself. I'll start from ther beginning though.\n\n&gt;World is at peace\n\nFalse. Just, false. As long as there has been civilization there has been conflict. Don't even know where they're getting this.\n\nThey continue to start with everything about different civilizations, that weren't even around at the same time. Why are Mongolia, Persia, the Indus, \"Native Americans\", and \"Africa\" being discussed at the same time? Never mind that Africa is super diverse and made up of a ton of different cultures and peoples, as are the Native Americans. They're all monolithic groups now.\n\n&gt;Greece gets very racist and oppressive in general for just no reason\n\nYep, the Greeks invented racism and oppression. It's all because of them. The world was all rainbows and sunshine and nobody did anything bad before. /s Seriously though, Greece was another civilization. They weren't overall necessarily better or worse than anyone else. And to say they just became very oppressive and racist for \"No reason?\" Did the whole society just all wake up and suddenly decide to be racist jerks or something?\n\n&gt;Rome ruins themselves; why\n\nRome ruins themselves. That's it. They existed for a while, then ruined themselves. Nevermind the fact that they lasted for centuries and centuries, and even longer if we count Byzantium. They ruined themselves just like that. Contributed nothing beforehand.\n\n&gt;White people oppress themselves for 1000 years (Why?????)\n\nI honestly don't even know where to begin with this. It's just bad. Bad bad history. Again, the rest of the world had bad things going on too. White people isn't such a monolithic entity, and they certainly didn't do nothing but oppress themselves for the entire time after Rome fell. Also, why are you focusing just on white people now? What about world history? Everywhere else?\n\n\n&gt;White people fight feudalism\n\n&gt;White people pat themselves on the back for not shitting on each other\n\nBut... Huh? Again, I don't know where to start here. So, after oppressing each other for a thousand years, white people suddenly decide that's enough and fight against feudalism? And then it goes away just like that? No. Feudalism ending and increasing rights was a gradual process. There wasn't just one Europe-wide revolution to end feudalism. And what about Japanese feudalism? Does that not exist?\n\nHoo boy, I'll just tackle the rest of this in larger chunks, here's where it gets really repetitive.\n\n&gt;White people get out of control\n\n&gt;White people go to Congo and ruin everything\n\n&gt;White people go to China and ruin everything\n\n&gt;White people go to Congo again and ruin everything again\n\n&gt;White people go everywhere and ruin everything\n\nThis is such a simplistic and simply incorrect view of history. White people get out of control? Yes, white people did horrible things in the Congo. What's this second time they're talking about though? Anyone care to enlighten me? Is this more badhistory or is there some sort of basis in the go to the Congo again statement? As for China, we did a lot of bad things there too, so I won't touch too heavily on that. But go everywhere and ruin everything? Please. Just off the top of my head, some places not subject to European imperialism include Ethiopia, Japan, much of China (arguable, with spheres of influence and all, but Europeans really didn't directly control a significant amount of it). There's plenty more I'm missing too I'm sure.\n\n&gt;Mongolia stays strong through all of this; you go Mongolia\n\nWhat, Mongolia gets a pass despite all the awful things they did? Also, what do you mean Mongolia stays strong?! Hate to rain on this guy's parade, but Mongolia was essentially a client state of the Qing dynasty by this time period. Hardly \"Staying strong\"\n\n&gt;White people export homophobia, racism, transphobia, ableism\n\nBecause none of those things existed before white people, right?\n\n&gt;White people steal four continents\n\nSteal 4 continents? First of all, white people is still incredibly monolithic. Secondly, why 4? What 4? Asia is a definite no. I'll give them Australia maybe, Africa was mostly controlled by Europeans but there were independent bits, and the Americas are... complicated. \n\n&gt;White people force capitalism upon the world\n\nYep. All white people were capitalist. There were no other economic ideologies. \n\n&gt;White people kill people everywhere\n\nThis is true, but people killed people everywhere. Not limited to white people.\n\n&gt;White people threaten each other all the time\n\nAlso true, also common of humans in general.\n\n&gt;White people drag everyone into huge wars\n\nThis is indirectly true-ish, but still iffy. Wars were similar to any others throughout history, they just had a lot more power and resources, allowing them to grow larger. Also, dragging EVERYONE into it is saying a lot. Don't work in absolutes.\n\n&gt;White people pretend to promote democracy\n\nBecause all white societies were democratic. All of them. Just look at Russia in this period. Or the amount of revolutions France went through. Or Austria. So much democracy /s\n\n&gt;White people really just promote capitalism and militarized imperialism\n\nimperialism was promoted by many white people. Capitalism? See my earlier comments about capitalism.\n\n&gt;White people cause global warming\n\nI... what? How are ONLY white people responsible for global warming? I don't understand.\n\n&gt;White people continue to support systemic racism, imperialism, slavery\n\n[Slavery was being abolished in many countries around this time period. Britain, THE imperialist empire, abolished it in 1833. Plenty of other white majority countries did in the time period too.\n](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abolitionism)\n&gt;White people pretend nothing is their fault\n\nUmmm, no. This is blatantly wrong.\n\n&gt;Why\n\nMy reaction to this whole post.",

Despite multiple posts claiming otherwise in the comments, and actual evidence presented, OP still refuses to beleive that is was not \"possibly\" the first.\n\nThe facy of the matter is that automata have been conceptualized for much longer than 500 years. The  ancient Greeks described automata in their mythology and there is strong evidence that water-powered moving statues - specifically, evidence has been found for such statues in Corinth. Her of Alexandria in the 1st century described the mechanisms behind automata. Moving forward, the Byzantine court heavily used automata to decorate the Emperor's throne room. Robert II of Artois built a pleasure garden in the 13th century - 200 years before Leonardo was even born - that contained both animal and humanoid automata.\n\nEven taking OP's moving goalpost in to account, a fully programmable humanoid automaton was described by Al-Jazari in 1206. This was basically a pleasure craft with an all automata jam band to play music for royal guests. The band played music, moved and even changed facial expressions.\n\nThe fact of the matter is automata are much older than many people realize. Cultures all around the world have built them. This weird obsession Reddit has with Leonardo DaVinci ignores all of this in favour of a lone scientific genius who came up with incredible concepts seemingly out of nowhere centuries ahead of his time. It's utter nonsense.

Germany was to take the part of British India roughly corresponding to northern and western parts of modern day Pakistan, while the rest of British India was marked for Japan.\n\nSo not so interested as a liberator of India. And as for the /r/India link, /u/Fluttershy_qtest puts it well in the [comment here](http://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/24s3aw/why_do_indians_love_hitler_np/chancqe).\n\n&gt;/r/india is a bigoted jingoistic hindu fundamentalist shithole.

Of course they would like Nazis and Hitler.\n\n&gt;Of course there's a group of fiercely proud Indians that worship Subhas Chandra Bose, and since he liked Hitler they do as well by extension.\n\n&gt;Other than that I think the people that praise Hitler and the Nazis are just ignorant about how much damage they did.\n\n&gt;This entire thread is utterly shameful with multiple posters defending hitler and the upvotes/downvotes on posts criticizing hitler prove how utterly awful this subreddit has become. It's become an absolutely vile circlejerk of privileged noveau riche urban indian young hindu men.\n\n&gt;The saddest thing about all this is that although they are an extremely vocal minority in educated circles a lot of poor people in India exhibit the same extreme hatred towards minorities.\n\n&gt;I agree that the popularity of Mein Kampf and Ayn Rand's garbage being popular in India is frightening.\n\nAlso this part:\n\n&gt;Gandhi was a great person for leadership and pushed the Indians to support a specific and sustainable ideology, but he most likely would have never accomplished much without someone else (i.e. Hitler) dragging the British away from India.\n\nCompletely ignoring any of the factors of the evolution of any Indian nationalism from 1857 to 1947(look up the historian Bipin Chandra).\n",

In essence, in wake of the extraordinary success of early Muslim conquests jurists developed a dual conception of the world, the Dar al-Islam, or House of Islam, and the Dar al-Harb, or House of War. It means basically what it looks like: lands are either Islamic or To-be-made-Islamic. This actually has some parallels in Crusade era Christian discourse about how Judgment Day can only arise when all lands are united under Christianity, but that is a different topic.\n\nWhat is important, though, is that this dual division did not last: jurists needed to justify the necessity of halted conquest, and do other concepts developed, such as the Dar al-Hudna, or House of Treaty. None of these concepts are in the Koran or Hadiths but have support from them. There was also considerable debate, some believed that Hudna can only be declared for a limited time, others indefinitely. But then again, some believe the Dar al-Islam is a matter of personal safety rather than state policy.\n\nFrom the broad view though, Islamic states behaved like other states and were perfectly happy to enter diplomatic arrangements with Christian states, sometimes against Islamic ones.\n\nQuick Wiki overview: http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divisions_of_the_world_in_Islam\n\nFurther discussion [here](https://books.google.com/books?id=PVSdSscBcZwC&amp;pg=PA69&amp;dq=dar+hudna&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=46ZVVcKUKMajgwSuwYGADQ&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=dar%20hudna&amp;f=false).",

        "text": "Look in general the crash course videos are fine , sure they simplify complex topics and sometimes  they are contrarian for contrarian sake but that is inevatible when they get a non-historan and 12 minutes per video.But one of his [episodees](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnV_MTFEGIY&amp;index=24&amp;list=PLBDA2E52FB1EF80C9) the one on slavery , takes such a large and complex topic and simplifies to the point that  you have to be asking what he was thinking when making the episode.\n&gt;The first truly European slave trade happened after the 4th crusade \n\nI am deeply confused what he means here by ''european'' later in the video ,he discusses slavery in ancient greece and rome.So what does he mean by europeans\n&gt;we need to get inside in what mark twain famously called a deformed consciousnesses \n\nThis is one of the worst approaches to slavery and history in general , you don't  judge past groups of people but our modern values and you certainly don't believe that they should have know that slavery was wrong the entire time.This is specifically a weird way of writing the history of slavery , in which nearly all agricultural societies  in history either owned slaves are didn't think it is wrong.\n&gt;Giving these appalling conditions ,it's little wonder that the average life expancty for a slave on a sugar plantation was 23 years........brutality of working conditions in brazil on the other head , meant that Brazil's slave population could never increase naturally.\n\nOf course, part of the reason [was the fact the slave pouplation was overwhelming male](https://books.google.com/books?id=46LKBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA19&amp;dq=communities+and+networks+in+the+ancient+greek+world&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=bT9VVZv7AonNoATl94D4Cw&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=snippet&amp;q=brazil&amp;f=false) just a nitpick and certranily not the worst part of the video.\n&gt;Like remeber Zheng He, the world’s greatest admiral?\n5:28He was technically a slave.\n&gt;So were many of the most important advisers to Sueleiman the Magnificent.\nSo was Darth Vader. But, Atlantic World slavery was different, and more horrifying, because it was chattel a term historians use to indicate that the slaves were movable property.\n\nSo what is the difference between chattel slavery and the other types of slavery, it seems that all of these peoples were owned by other people.\n&gt;Most Greek slaves were “barbarians,” and their inability to speak Greek kept them from talking back\nto their masters and also indicated their slave status.\nAristotle, who despite being spectacularly wrong about almost everything was incredibly\ninfluential, believed some people were just naturally slaves,\nsaying:“it is clear that there are certain people who are free and certain people who are slavesby nature, and it is both to their advantage, and just, for them to be slaves.”\nThe Greeks popularized the idea that slaves should be traded from far away, but the Romans\ntook it to another level.Slaves probably made up 30% of the total Roman population, similar to the percentage of slaves\n\nThis is probably one of the worst parts of the whole thing, it just gets facts wrong.For example , wouldn't  domestic slaves and bankers need to know Greek.[ I even got a number around 50% probably needed to know Greek](https://books.google.com/books?id=46LKBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA19&amp;dq=communities+and+networks+in+the+ancient+greek+world&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=bT9VVZv7AonNoATl94D4Cw&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=snippet&amp;q=brazil&amp;f=false)Second,there is a promblem of omminson , his only perspective on ancient slavery is Aristotle ignoring the highly popular group of philosophers the Stoics and there views on slavery(which differed in some ways quite significantly to Aristotle) Also , second 30% represents [roman Italy](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=what%20percentage%20of%20ancient%20rome%20were%20slaves) not the entire roman empire.\nNext their is the third part which is the worst part where he theorizes what causes the Atlantic slave trade.\n&gt;The Spanish and the Portuguese, you no doubt remember, were the Europeans with the closest\nties to the Muslim world, because there were Muslims living in the Iberian Peninsula until\n1492.So it makes sense that Iberians would be the first to absorb these racist attitude toward as the first colonizers of the Americas and the dominant importers of slaves, the\nPortuguese and the Spanish helped define the attitudes that characterized Atlantic slavery,\n\nThis is one of the most bizarre ideas of what caused the Atlantic slave trade, correct me if I am wrong but from what I have read the main cause of African slavery in the Atlantic world was a labor shortage caused by the  death of native Americans and the racist came up because of the Atlantic slave trade not caused it.\n\nYeah, this last part is what made me write this, it is so wrong so werdily on the fringe for a history video that I just had to comment.  \n",

White slaves were also cheaper, and made to do the more dangerous labor.\"](http://np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/35vido/til_in_1850_42_of_free_negroes_in_charleston_sc/cr8cgz2)\n\n\n\nWell that's shitty but nothing really insane. But! He included a source! Oh goody! [Let's take a look at it shall we?](http://www.vice.com/read/hey-v12n5)\n\n\n\n\nNow it's titled *Hey Kids... It's Time For Some Dumb Myths And Smart Facts About Slavery!* Promising, promising. Doubtlessly ol' Jim Goad here is gonna open the floodgates of knowledge unto us.  I'm positive this unaccredited man is gonna turn all those exhaustively-researched textbooks on their ass!\n\n\n\n **SMART FACT #1:** \n\n\n&gt; Black slavery in America was pretty bad, kids, but it wasn't anything special. Throughout history, every color of the rainbow has owned slaves and been enslaved. The dictionary tells us that the root word of \"slave\" is \"Slav,\" because Slavic peoples—who are REALLY pale and white—were the primary slave population throughout the Middle Ages. And though your teachers will never tell you this, there have been long stretches of history where Africans have owned white people as slaves! How do you like THEM apples? The empire of Carthage transported white slaves to Africa. The African Moors ruled Spain for 500 years and sent white Christian slaves to Egypt. And poor, defenseless white kids—just like you!—were kidnapped by Muslims during the Children's Crusade and sold into Egyptian slavery.\n\n\nGee, it would seem that other nations and groups practiced slavery too, therefore the Transatlantic Slave Trade was just another day at the office as far as history goes. Of course that does ignore the exceptionally brutal conditions that chattel slaves faced and how it created a centuries-long prejudice towards black people in America.\n\n**SMART FACT #2:** \n\n&gt; No, kids—the blacks, Arabs, and Jews were involved, too. The president of an African country called Benin recently apologized to American blacks for his country's role in the slave trade. Slavery was common throughout Africa, with entire tribes becoming enslaved after losing battles. Tribal chieftains often sold their defeated foes to white slave-traders. *Goes on to mention how other slave trades asides the TAST existed*\n\n\nOh yes, the classic 'well other people did it too' argument. This is like saying that cholera isn't a big deal because everyone shits. Yes slavery has been a thing since pretty much forever, and yes untold numbers of slaves had shitty lives too. But it is fairly well-known that the TAST was a [unique turd](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/2bapcn/i_dont_think_that_ancient_slavery_is_really/) and that it differed from most other forms of slavery in significant ways, namely that it was a very closed system. In many, many other slavery organizations throughout history a slave could very well rise through the ranks and become a respectable member of society, however TAST chattel slavery was entirely closed and justified through race. \n\n\n\nI hate this kind of argument for having the gall to try and blame the Africans for their own misfortune. For one 'Africa' is not some homogeneous mass anymore than Europe is. Using that logic we could blame 'Europe' for it's own enslaved population because of all the Slav's who were enslaved. Secondly it ignores that fact that the Transatlantic ~~States Right's~~ Slave Trade was responsible for providing a constant demand. \n\n\n**SMART FACT #3!** \n\n\n&gt; Of the 10 to 15 million Africans who were transplanted to the New World, no more than 6 percent—around 400,000—went to the Northern Hemisphere. Almost all of them went to South America, but you don't see your teachers giving Brazil a hard time, do you?\n\n\nMaybe because Brazil isn't part of America and American highschools tend to focus on American history? Also what the fuck? Is he saying 'Location location location'? This is no way diminishes the horrors of the TAST.\n\n\n\n**SMART FACT #4** \n\n\n\n\n&gt; Blacks were never close to a majority in America, so it's mathematically impossible for most whites to have owned black slaves. At the peak of black slavery in the South, only 6 percent of Southern whites owned slaves. If you include the white people in the North, it means that only 1.4 percent of white Americans owned black slaves at the HEIGHT of slavery.\n\n\n\n\nShameless number fudging, the [actual numbers are fairly self-evident.](http://www.civil-war.net/pages/1860_census.html)\n\n\n\n\n**SMART FACT #5** \n\n\n&gt; An estimated 3,000 blacks owned a total of 20,000 black slaves in the year 1860. One study concluded that 28 percent of free blacks owned slaves, which is a far higher percentage than that of free whites who owned slaves.\n\n\nThis of course prompts the usual response of 'And?' And so what? That makes it okay? That absolves all the white slave owners?\n\n\n\n**SMART FACT #6** \n\n\n\n&gt; Although your textbooks are silent about it, most historians agree that two-thirds of ALL whites came to the colonies in some form of bondage. Legal papers on both sides of the ocean referred to them as \"slaves.\" White slaves outnumbered black slaves in America throughout the 1600s.\n\n\n\nI'd love to see these 'most historians'. I'd also like to see where he gets off comparing the status of African chattel slaves to indentured servants who came from Europe. I'll give you a hint, [they're not the same.](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1ou972/are_there_any_sources_regarding_irish_slavery_in/) \n\n\n\n**SMART FACT #7**\n\n\n\n&gt; Hundreds of thousands of white slaves were kidnapped and brought to America; their middle-passage death rates were comparable to those of black slaves; they were sold at auction and traded for livestock, they were routinely beaten—sometimes to death—and an estimated one half of them died before gaining freedom. It's possible that more whites came to America against their will than blacks. Historians from both ends of the political spectrum say that white slaves were treated worse than black slaves.\n\n\nToeing on mortatorium ground here, but the word Irish doesn't come up, just saying.\n\n\nWhere the fuck is he getting this information? More whites came to N.America unwillingly than blacks? Certainly some did but not a majority by any stretch. Historian Richard Hofstader has the following to say on the subject.\n\n\n\n*\"Although efforts were made to regulate or check their activities, and they diminished in importance in the eighteenth century, it remains true that a certain small part of the white colonial population of America was brought by force, and a much larger portion came in response to deceit and misrepresentation on the part of the spirits [recruiting agents].\"*\n\n\n\n\nNo one's saying that being an indentured servant was a peaches and sunshine, but it was leagues better than chattel slavery. You had legal rights and were free to become a regular member of society after ten years, an options black slaves virtually never had.\n\n\n\n**SMRT FACT #8** \n\n\n\n&gt; According to statistics, farm work is relatively safe. It is far more dangerous to be a lumberjack, Alaskan crab fisherman, coal miner, or cabdriver. Either way, white slaves were forced to pick cotton under the hot sun, too, which is where they got those red necks.\n\n\n\nOh lovely, modern farm work is relatively safe compared to other modern jobs. Obviously that applies to the conditions slaves in the cotton fields were subjected to as well, totally legit. And this bottle is emptying *fast.* I found out this writer is a published and acclaimed author. Oh goody. *twitch*\n\n\n**I AM SO SMART S-M-R-T FACT #10**\n\n\n\n&gt; When General Robert E. Lee surrendered to Ulysses S. Grant, it had been nearly 20 years since Lee owned slaves—he freed his slaves in the late 1840s. In 1856, five years before the Civil War started, he wrote that slavery was \"a moral and political evil.\" On the other hand, General Grant STILL owned slaves at the end of the Civil War, because Abe Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation cleverly outlawed slavery only in the South. Grant had stated that he would refuse to fight if he thought the war had anything to do with slavery. And hey, kids, even if it WAS fought to end slavery, how often do you see the descendants of slaves thanking the 600,000 or so white soldiers who died in the fight to free them?\n\n\n\n[No.](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/us25s/civil_war_slavery_or_states_rights/)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWell children this certainly has been a learning experience, one where we learn the limits of our livers and just how fucking low standards can be in order to be considered an 'expert.'\n",

At best it had a legally ambiguous ability to secede for a fundamentally horrible reason. The Constitution says nothing about secession, so the best you can argue is that the South tried it and discovered it was illegal when Congress didn't recognize it as valid (and whatever possible Constitutionality of it was dashed by *Texas v.

        "text": "Over on HuffPo, a tech CEO and therefore history expert called Todd R. Miller has posted [a long spiel about Hypatia of Alexandria](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/todd-r-miller/librarian-murdered-by-egy_b_7245448.html), which then segues into a rant about Christianity holding back science, Galileo (of course), Bruno (of course) and, oddly, non-Trinitarian humanist Étienne Dolet (eh?).  And then he gets onto climate change denial, Creationism and paranoid Texans.  It is a strange piece in many ways, though not least because his main source seems to be \"the great Carl Sagan\" and his original *Cosmos* series.  Unsurprisingly, it's a clusterbunch of stinking bad history.\n\nI've posted a critique of the article in the comments section, though this keeps getting removed, so I'll reproduce it here as an R5.\n\n&gt;\"ALEXANDRIA, Egypt -- A scholar at this city's library was murdered by a mob of religious fanatics during her morning commute to work. \"\n\nNone of the accounts we have about Hypatia associates her with any \"library\".  The writer above seems to be following astronomer Carl Sagan's weirdly bungled version of the story, where he claims she was a \"librarian of the Great Library of Alexandria\".  In fact, the Great Library had been burned down by Julius Caesar about 400 years before Hypatia was even born.  Any remaining collection was destroyed in the sack and burning of the royal quarter of Alexandria by Aurelian in 273 AD, around 77 years before her birth.  The idea that Hypatia was associated in any way with this long vanished Library is pure fantasy.\n\n&gt;\"she was stopped by the mob, pulled from her transport and stripped bare before being skinned alive\"\n\nNo, she was stoned to death by roof tiles, referred to by their nickname \"oyster shells\".  Edward Gibbon, writing in 1776, could not work out what the Greek word used here referred to and so decided that she had been flayed by actual shells, and this became another lurid element in her myth.\n\n&gt;\"The mob then moved on to the library, renowned as the world's greatest archive of ancient texts, setting it ablaze. \"\n\nSee above - there was no longer any Great Library in Hypatia's time, its last remnants having been destroyed about 140 years earlier.  Sagan seems to be trying to refer to the destruction of the Serapeum, which had housed a smaller \"daughter library\" which had survived somewhat longer.  But he gets the chronology completely wrong - the Serapeum was dismantled in 390 AD, and Hypatia was murdered in 415.  And the evidence indicates that the Serapeum had long since ceased to house any library by the time it was demolished anyway.  Sagan not only gets the whole story wrong, but he makes parts of it up wholesale.  His account is fiction, not history.\n\n&gt;\"the contemporary historiographer Socrates Scholasticus described her this way in his Ecclesiastical History\"\n\nScholasticus also made it clear that her murder was an assassination in a purely political dispute, in revenge for the killing of a member of a rival faction in the savage street politics of Alexandria.  But that's nowhere near as fun as a scientist being killed by religious fanatics because of their hatred of knowledge.  Once again, the historical evidence contradicts the myth being peddled here.\n\n&gt;\"As the great Carl Sagan explained in his original Cosmos series, \"Cyril despised her...because she was a symbol of learning and science which were largely identified by the early church with paganism.\"\"\n\nYes, but the great Carl Sagan was a terrible historian.  Nothing in the evidence supports that claim.  And by the fifth century Christianity had happily come to accept learning and science as gifts from God and as \"the gold of the Egyptians\" worthy of being used regardless of its pagan origins  The great Sagan didn't know what he was talking about.\n\n&gt;\"Many historians view Hypatia's murder as the symbolic death of classical antiquity, the advent of a thousand year period of intellectual darkness, whose eventual coda was the Renaissance. \"\n\nMany historians such as who?  That antiquated view would not be accepted by any of the modern historians of western thought, who have long since rejected the idea of the Middle Ages as a \"1000 year dark age\" and who have recognised the rebirth of knowledge lost in the fall of Rome as happening centuries earlier than the \"Renaissance\". Besides, Alexandria was in the Eastern Empire which, unlike the Western Empire, didn't collapse for another 1000 years.  And intellectual life went on there as it always had.  More cartoon history.\n\n&gt;\"It would take over 1,100 years for Nicolaus Copernicus to reinvent the work of Aristarchus of Samos, who correctly determined that the Earth orbits the Sun - not the other way around.\"\n\nSo how does the writer explain the fact that Aristarchus' idea was roundly rejected by the ancient Greeks and Romans centuries before Christianity came along - and on purely logical grounds?  It was rejected because it didn't work, not out of ignorance.  None other than Aristotle laid out the rational reasons the ancients thought heliocentrism was wrong.\n\n&gt;\"Galileo, some 60 years after Copernicus' death, was forced, on pain of death, by the church Inquisition to recant Copernicus' heliocentric model of the solar system.'\n\nYes, because he was contradicted by pretty much every scientist of the time and, more importantly, because he tried his hand at interpreting scripture in the light of this fringe theory - not exactly a smart move in the Counter Reformation.  But, again, let's not let historical context or facts get in the way of a good rant.\n\n&gt;\"Hero of Alexandria, an extraordinary mechanical genius, who invented steam engines, wind turbines and automated machines - the forerunners of today's cybernetics.\"\n\nFantasy.  Hero's little aeolipile was a toy, not a \"steam engine\". \n\n&gt;\"fellow intellectuals Giordano Bruno and Étienne Dolet\"\n\nBruno was a mystic who was executed for his denial of the Trinity, the Virgin Birth and the divinity of Jesus.  Étienne Dolet was also a non-Trinitarian who was executed for those purely religious ideas.  The idea that they were executed to suppress any proto-scientific ideas is pure nonsense.\n\n&gt;\"While religion is fueled by faith, science is grounded in evidence. \"\n\nThat's nice, but it has very little to do with the tangle of pseudo historical fable outlined above.  The historical evidence contradicts this \"just so story\" at every turn.\n\nIf you're going to try to use history to make a point, do your homework better.  Hint: try using the work of actual historians rather than a TV series by an astronomer next time.",

        "text": "Found this gem on /r/libertarian.:\n\n&gt;[Redskins has never been a negative term, until SJWs chose to interpret it that way. It always represented a proud and fierce warrior, and was even a self applied term back in the day.](http://np.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/35l75s/aclu_argues_that_cancellation_of_redskins/cr5nmce)\n\nThere are several other good ones in there, such as:\n\n&gt;[\"Redskin\" doesn't even disparage native Americans - it's a slang term for a scalp (and scalping was first used by europeans against the native Americans) so I'm not sure where the \"disparaging\" comes in.](http://np.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/35l75s/aclu_argues_that_cancellation_of_redskins/cr5naxz)\n\n(This one is debatable because it's not really bad history that the person doesn't *know* where disparaging comes in, but it echoes the sentiment that a lot of people in that thread seem to be alluding to.)\n\nI wasn't sure whether this belonged here or in /r/badlinguistics. It could probably go in both places. I know it's not the most prominent post, but I've been seeing similar statements pop up elsewhere on Reddit and heard people say things like that a lot in real life, so I figured I might as well address it.\n\nR5: It's heavily disputed that it was a self-applied term in any meaningful sense, let alone that the fact that it was a self-applied term would indicate that it \"represented a proud and fierce warrior.\"\n\nI think it goes without saying that the stereotype of all native americans as being \"a proud and fierce warrior\" is in itself bad history, but that's not really what I want to look at. \n\nThe idea that the term Redskin has been only or even mostly positive (giving OP the benefit of the doubt that they were using hyperbole) and connoted valor or bravery in every time period before \"SJWs chose to interpret it [as offensive]\" (which I am going to generously assume means basically any time in the last 50 years) is laughable. \n\nIn Bruce Stapleton's book [*Redskins: Racial Slur or Symbol of Success*](https://books.google.com/books?id=Isj8cHpz3zQC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA82#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=82), he examines 42 books published between 1875 and 1930, looking at the instances of usage of the word in positive, negative, and neutral/ambiguous contexts (pages 82-83 for those following along at home). Of these usages, 26% were explicitly derogatory, 72% were ambiguous, and only 3% were positive, e.g. connoting valor or pride like OP claims. In contrast, \"Indian\" is used in a derogative sense only 11% of the time and positively 7.7% of the time. Still not the most inherently positive term, but less negative than \"Redskin.\" Interestingly, some authors switch back and forth between the two, using \"Redskin\" when trying to connote savagery and mere pages later switching to \"Indian\" when trying to connote naive innocence (which was about the best you could hope for in terms of a representation of native americans at the time).\n\nBut perhaps the more specific question is whether or not the Washington Redskins team is a victim of changing connotations of words, as OP seems to think, or whether it was named at a time when it was indeed an offensive term. The latter is almost certainly true. Geoffrey Nunberg, the linguist who testified against the Washington Redskins in the trademark case, explains in an [editorial](http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2014/06/a-linguist-on-why-redskin-is-racist-patent-overturned/373198/) for The Atlantic:\n\n&gt;Whatever the connotations of “redskin” now, the question facing the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board was whether it was disparaging when the team first registered it as a trademark in 1967. If that was so, the registration would have fallen afoul of the provision of the Lanham Act that disallows the registration of trademarks that may disparage the members of a group.\n\nThe main argument against the idea that the word was a slur at the time (per the defense strategy of the team's attorneys), is simply that dictionaries didn't list it as such. But then again, they also didn't list \"Gook\" or \"Fag,\" so that argument doesn't really hold water. It seems pretty clear that the word carried negative or condescending connotations beginning at the latest in the 19th century, if only because of imperialist attitudes of the time. But even if one chooses to disregard that, play it safe, and see the word as neutral, then it still doesn't fit the idea that it represents \"a proud and fierce warrior\" or that it has historically had any degree of pride or honor associated with it in general usage at any point in the last 200 or so years, and evidence suggests that it was in fact used in a derogatory fashion more often than in a positive fashion.\n\n",

It's basically \"who were the great powers in the 6th century BC? What about the 4th century BC? What about the first century BC? What about...,\" or, \"what weird misconceptions do I have about the historical timeline?\" (Not to be mean - the historical \"timeline\" can be a vague and foggy thing for many years even for dedicated students).\n\nA few users interpret the question in the most (historically-speaking) useless, data-driven reductionist way possible, such as:\n\n&gt;Prepare to have a historogasm: http://www.timemaps.com/history\n\nWhich gives us the subject of today's post, an unironic endorsement of a uniquely terrible \"histogram\" from nearly a hundred years ago:\n\n&gt;&gt;http://media.boingboing.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/histomap1.jpg \n\n&gt;&gt;much better\n\nYikes!\n\nLike most history-based \"infographics,\" this one, published in 1931 by Rand McNally courtesy product-of-his-time John Sparks, has more problems, both on a technical level and a theoretical one, than any critic could truly pin down - it's just across the board a dirty, rotten representation of the world. \n\nOther commenters of /r/history know this, and take a stab anyway; they point out that's it's \"shitty Eurocentric trash,\" and \"pseudoscientific colonialist garbage,\" noting the absolutely unapologetic diminishing of all of Asian history to a millimeter-wide sliver of green called \"China.\" Likewise, the disproportionate blobs of \"Greece\" and \"Rome\" are comedic in their audacity.\n\nThese are all true.\n\nYet some /r/historians disagree...\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;While I agree with you, China had a very isolated existence and was much less influential than they should have been for a power like themselves.\n\nI can't imagine the conditions one would have to believe in for this statement to have any truth to it. Southeast Asia don't real? China... Don't... Real? How do you even... I mean...\n\nOther redditors just plain don't get that far along the criticism-line.\n\n&gt;&gt;So intimidating at first, then amazing.\n\nWow, so simplification, much colors.\n\n&gt;&gt;\n\nAnyway, after all that mess (in which the people who know better, at least, outweigh the people who think \"Aryan proto-Nordics\" are a useful category), lo and behold a second, completely independent endorsement of the monstrosity:\n\n&gt;http://media.boingboing.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/histomap1.jpg\n\n&gt;imma gonna let you finish, but Histomap had one of the best history maps of all time.\n\nJust the sort of memetic communication technique an uncharitable man in an armchair might suspect from someone who endorses that map as \"the best history maps of all time.\"\n\nYet it's not Rand McNally or Sparks' fault for catering to their audience, is it? I mean, even today, the thirst for reductionist nonsense is utterly insatiable among the inquisitive youth...\n\n&gt;Why has no one just made a gif of the map with notable empires etc. That moves from say 3000bc to present day showing where each empires borders were.\n\nI actually have my own uniquely racist 20th century histogram, a huge printed number that unfolds horizontally and has a different system than this, but equally awful. It has a featured \"ethnography\" section with portraits of \"ethnicities\" like \"Mussulman,\" \"Aryan,\" etc. Unfortunately I can't find it now - I wanted to include some pictures. Maybe notoriously bad histograms have something of their own following and someone here will have an idea of what I'm thinking of. \n\nHonestly, I think the real problem isn't even in the particular foibles of any given histogram - I think it genuinely might simply be the concept itself is bad, that no matter how you try to do it, you'll fail, and you'll look kind of ignorant and possibly racist even at your best.\n\nSorry, I stole my R5 from other peoples' comments, but what's the point, they covered it anyway. Just look at that map - it's hideous. Nearly beyond explanation.\n",

Or if someone wants to know what was there in that time,quoting Wikipedia:\n\n&gt;**13,000–8,000 BCE**\n\n&gt;Noticeable burial activity resumes. Prior mortuary activity had either taken a less obvious form or contemporaries retained some of their burial knowledge in the absence of such activity; dozens of men, women, and children were being buried in the same caves which were used for burials 10,000 years beforehand. All these graves are delineated by the cave walls and large limestone blocks. The burials are very similar to each other and share a number of characteristics—ochre, shell and mammoth ivory jewellery—that go back thousands of years. Some burials are double, comprising an adult male with a juvenile male buried by his side. They are now appearing to take on the form of modern cemeteries. Old burials are commonly being redug and moved to make way for the new ones, with the older bones often being gathered and cached together. Large stones may have acted as grave markers. Pairs of ochred antlers are sometimes poles within the cave; this is compared to the modern practice of leaving flowers at one's grave.\n\nOrganized religion-the earliest evidences for any form of it,are found some time later,say,in the 10th millenium BCE,with the founding of [Göbekli Tepe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6bekli_Tepe).\n\n&gt;The Abrahamic religions have almost killed all their mystics.\n\nAnother badhistory and /r/bad_religion material here: Quoting /u/brought_  's [comment](https://np.reddit.com/r/hinduism/comments/35h1z4/the_reason_why_hinduism_is_slightly_better_than/cr4eifp)\n\n&gt;Abrahamic religions have almost killed all their mystics.\n&gt;&gt;Oh my. Mysticism is quite a thing in Orthodox Christianity(Eastern and Oriental)? The Desert Fathers are quite revered by everyone(except ignorant Protestants,which is basically American Christianity).\n&gt;we know that man is god himself and that realizing the soul means achieving godhood as there is not difference between the soul and god.\n&gt;&gt;There is this famous Patristic formula 'God has become man so that man may become God.' And Patristic stuff is pretty much foundational to Christianity(no matter how many ignoramuses are there).\n\n&gt;The Desert Fathers,Hildegard of Bingen, Bernard of Clairvaux, the Victorines,(particularly Hugh and Richard of St. Victor),Teresa of Avila,Eriugena,Julian of Norwich,Padre Pio,etc. All of them are actually quite famous in the Church,not persecuted. Oh,and who can forget the spirituality of Dag Hammarskjöld?\nI don't know much about Islam though,so I will keep my mouth silent on that.\n\n",

        "text": "Hi /r/badhistory. First time ~~caller~~ effort post, long time ~~listener~~ commenter/lurker. \n\nSo I'm browsing through The Onion's *A.V. Club* the other day when I stumble across this article,\n[*New web series highlights history’s forgotten assholes*](http://www.avclub.com/article/new-web-series-highlights-historys-forgotten-assho-218827). Almost immediately the cynic in me thinks, \"Oh great, a pop-history youtube series. This will end in either tears or inaccuracies.\" Well turns out, I wasn't too far off. \n\nThe article introduces us to this web series [inaugural episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHOmTL65v7M) found here. We're told this first episode is about none other than Lord Herbert Kitchener and how he invented concentration camps during the Boer War, which gave the Nazis the inspiration (and justification, in their eyes) they needed to build their own camps 30+ years later. While there is some truth to this, it is not nearly as black and white as this video makes it out to be, and for that, it's bad history. \n\nAs I'm sure a good chunk of the viewership of /r/badhistory is aware, we've gone over the topic of \"Britain invented concentration camps!\" vein of bad [history](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/1mb788/the_british_invented_the_concentration_camp/) a few [times](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2323ol/britain_invented_concentration_camps_in_the_boer/).  So I say, I'll do my part and go once more into the breach to help quash this annoying bit of bad history. \n\nOk, so the first piece of bad history is that the video/host makes the claim that Kitchener alone invented concentration camps during the Boer War. The choice quote from the video that I'm pointing to for R5 violations is \"Yeah, you heard me, a British guy invented concentration camps!\" This is false. \n\nKitchener came into command of British forces in South Africa shortly after the defeat of conventional Boer forces in November 1900. Lord Frederick Roberts had been in command previous to this, and *gasp* was actually the first to implement the strategy of using concentration camps during the Boer War (the Spanish technically have the honor of being first with their using camps in Cuba during the Spanish American War) in an effort to house and concentrate (which the video makes mention of as to what the idea behind concentration camps originally was, to it's credit) the civilian Boer population that had either been displaced by the fighting, or were removed in order to prevent them from rendering aid and support to Boer forces or guerillas. Kitchener upon assuming command of British forces in the region, expanded upon the use of those camps, which led to their (just) reputation as being inhumane and cruel upon the civilian population. \n\nNow, /r/AskHistorians mod and flaired user, /u/Bernardito wrote a [fantastic post](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1kqi9y/when_were_concentration_camps_last_used_as_a/cbrlqkw) on the use of concentration camps in conterinsurgency warfare in the late 19th and early 20th centruy. /r/Bernardito explains in their post how despite their name would lead you to believe otherwise, that the concentration camps used by Spain, Great Britain and the U.S. were essentially large refugee camps (though not with altruistic intentions like later day refugee camps), and not on the same level nor comparable to the camps later built and utilized by Nazi Germany. \n\nThere's also a bit later on the video where the host proclaims that the British Ambassador (they don't say which one, so was it Sir Eric Phipps or Sir Neville Henderson? Pfft, it doesn't matter, this is a ~~anecdote~~ history lesson!) to Nazi Germany before WWII, complained to Hermann Goering (not sure why him and not say, I don't know, the foreign minister, Von Ribbentrop?) about Germany's treatment of Jews and gypsies. The video claims that Goering responded by pulling down an encyclopedia, looked up concentration camps, pointed it out to the ambassador, and then used that as as an argument against the British ambassador's complaints. While I'm sure it's fun to imagine such scenarios taking place in junior high history classes, that's the first time I've ever heard of this exchange, and I've read quite about about Britain's diplomatic history with the Germans during the interwar period. Serious note, it's entirely possible this happened (though I have my doubts), so if someone has evidence or a source for this story, please feel free to post it!\n\nNow to be fair, the Nazis did point to the British use of concentration camps, the European colonization of Africa and the far east, as well as the American Indian Wars as semi-justification for their deportation/final solution against the Jews and Slavic peoples, especially so in Eastern Europe. Mark Mazower does a fantastic job of going over this bit of history in his book, [Hitler's Empire: How the Nazis Ruled Europe.](http://www.worldcat.org/title/hitlers-empire-how-the-nazis-ruled-europe/oclc/191929206) I highly recomend it to anyone who is interested in learning more about this.\n\nTo conclude, Kitchener didn't invent concentration camps. He did utilize them, yes, and he did expand upon their use upon taking command of British forces in South Africa, but he was not the sole inventor or mastermind behind their use. This video would have been fine had it made the claim \"Kitchener was an asshole because he expanded the idea of concentration camps to the point where thousands of civilians died due to maltreatment\", but it instead had to go for that brass ring of trying to tie the Nazis into Kitchener's actions and paint him as a proto-nazi/genocider in which the Nazi's cribbed their ideas from. \n\nIt's also very disingenuous to conflate the two, since, while I will admit first and foremost the camps use in the Boer war, as well the ones created by the Spanish in Cuba and the Americans in the Philippines were far from ideal, were often terribly implemented, inhumane, and a travesty on their own accords, but making a black and white comparison to concentration camps utilized by Nazi Germany isn't just disingenuous, it's a bit insulting and it's bad history to boot.\n\n**BONUS ROUND BAD HISTORY!!!!**\n\n\nOne other bonus bit that should be a red flag for anyone well read in the history of this era, is that early on in the video, the host also mentions how Lord Kitchener led the British Army at the outbreak of WWI. She then goes on to mention that he will be remembered for \"bravely and gallantly upholding the British tradition of making his men walk slowly into the gunfire of the enemy.\"\n\nSo as I'm sure most of you know, this is the famous \"Lions led by Donkeys\" trope that people like to spit out when talking about WWI. As /u/Elos did so eloquently here in /r/badhistory [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2hietf/first_world_war_effortpost_why_did_they_bother/), that talking point is absolute distilled, pure, bad history.",

While there is some truth to this, it is not nearly as black and white as this video makes it out to be, and for that, it's bad history. \n\nAs I'm sure a good chunk of the viewership of /r/badhistory is aware, we've gone over the topic of \"Britain invented concentration camps!\" vein of bad [history](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/1mb788/the_british_invented_the_concentration_camp/) a few [times](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2323ol/britain_invented_concentration_camps_in_the_boer/).  So I say, I'll do my part and go once more into the breach to help quash this annoying bit of bad history. \n\nOk, so the first piece of bad history is that the video/host makes the claim that Kitchener alone invented concentration camps during the Boer War. The choice quote from the video that I'm pointing to for R5 violations is \"Yeah, you heard me, a British guy invented concentration camps!\" This is false. \n\nKitchener came into command of British forces in South Africa shortly after the defeat of conventional Boer forces in November 1900. Lord Frederick Roberts had been in command previous to this, and *gasp* was actually the first to implement the strategy of using concentration camps during the Boer War (the Spanish technically have the honor of being first with their using camps in Cuba during the Spanish American War) in an effort to house and concentrate (which the video makes mention of as to what the idea behind concentration camps originally was, to it's credit) the civilian Boer population that had either been displaced by the fighting, or were removed in order to prevent them from rendering aid and support to Boer forces or guerillas. Kitchener upon assuming command of British forces in the region, expanded upon the use of those camps, which led to their (just) reputation as being inhumane and cruel upon the civilian population. \n\nNow, /r/AskHistorians mod and flaired user, /u/Bernardito wrote a [fantastic post](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1kqi9y/when_were_concentration_camps_last_used_as_a/cbrlqkw) on the use of concentration camps in conterinsurgency warfare in the late 19th and early 20th centruy. /r/Bernardito explains in their post how despite their name would lead you to believe otherwise, that the concentration camps used by Spain, Great Britain and the U.S. were essentially large refugee camps (though not with altruistic intentions like later day refugee camps), and not on the same level nor comparable to the camps later built and utilized by Nazi Germany. \n\nThere's also a bit later on the video where the host proclaims that the British Ambassador (they don't say which one, so was it Sir Eric Phipps or Sir Neville Henderson? Pfft, it doesn't matter, this is a ~~anecdote~~ history lesson!) to Nazi Germany before WWII, complained to Hermann Goering (not sure why him and not say, I don't know, the foreign minister, Von Ribbentrop?) about Germany's treatment of Jews and gypsies. The video claims that Goering responded by pulling down an encyclopedia, looked up concentration camps, pointed it out to the ambassador, and then used that as as an argument against the British ambassador's complaints. While I'm sure it's fun to imagine such scenarios taking place in junior high history classes, that's the first time I've ever heard of this exchange, and I've read quite about about Britain's diplomatic history with the Germans during the interwar period. Serious note, it's entirely possible this happened (though I have my doubts), so if someone has evidence or a source for this story, please feel free to post it!\n\nNow to be fair, the Nazis did point to the British use of concentration camps, the European colonization of Africa and the far east, as well as the American Indian Wars as semi-justification for their deportation/final solution against the Jews and Slavic peoples, especially so in Eastern Europe. Mark Mazower does a fantastic job of going over this bit of history in his book, [Hitler's Empire: How the Nazis Ruled Europe.](http://www.worldcat.org/title/hitlers-empire-how-the-nazis-ruled-europe/oclc/191929206) I highly recomend it to anyone who is interested in learning more about this.\n\nTo conclude, Kitchener didn't invent concentration camps. He did utilize them, yes, and he did expand upon their use upon taking command of British forces in South Africa, but he was not the sole inventor or mastermind behind their use. This video would have been fine had it made the claim \"Kitchener was an asshole because he expanded the idea of concentration camps to the point where thousands of civilians died due to maltreatment\", but it instead had to go for that brass ring of trying to tie the Nazis into Kitchener's actions and paint him as a proto-nazi/genocider in which the Nazi's cribbed their ideas from. \n\nIt's also very disingenuous to conflate the two, since, while I will admit first and foremost the camps use in the Boer war, as well the ones created by the Spanish in Cuba and the Americans in the Philippines were far from ideal, were often terribly implemented, inhumane, and a travesty on their own accords, but making a black and white comparison to concentration camps utilized by Nazi Germany isn't just disingenuous, it's a bit insulting and it's bad history to boot.\n\n**BONUS ROUND BAD HISTORY!!!!**\n\n\nOne other bonus bit that should be a red flag for anyone well read in the history of this era, is that early on in the video, the host also mentions how Lord Kitchener led the British Army at the outbreak of WWI. She then goes on to mention that he will be remembered for \"bravely and gallantly upholding the British tradition of making his men walk slowly into the gunfire of the enemy.\"\n\nSo as I'm sure most of you know, this is the famous \"Lions led by Donkeys\" trope that people like to spit out when talking about WWI. As /u/Elos did so eloquently here in /r/badhistory [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2hietf/first_world_war_effortpost_why_did_they_bother/), that talking point is absolute distilled, pure, bad history.",

So I wondered if other fields suffered from the same fate, and I remembered my Art History classes.\n\nThe lectures were by historians, never artists. Art was always presented as movements or waves of similar ideas, molded by environmental factors. So Impressionism would be a *collective* endeavor *prompted* by the invention of new paints, which *allowed* painters to work outside, *thus* rejecting symbolisms and depicting mundane scenes... etc. Always \"they\", always a marked collectivism (to the point of risking being an endless string of -isms.)\n\nIn contrast, History of Science is often promoted by physicists, biologists and the like. There is an extreme cult of personality around a few \"heroes\", who were obviously geniuses. Little social or biographical context usually comes into play. No collectivism or gradualism. No waves. You rarely learn about hermeticism, alchemy, astrology, humors, materialism, mechanism, stoicism... No! It's always a guy who \"discovered\" something.

In contrast, why is art, an activity in which individual expression is so important, so much more aware of collectivism in its past?\n\nAm I wrong to compare them? Is there as much bad history in the (pop) Art History as in the (pop) History of Science?\n\nTL;DR: Why is Art History \"waves\", and History of Science \"dudes\"?",

        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/35cj4s/muhammad_ali_conscientious_objector_everyone_else/",
        "text": "I stumbled across [this post](http://np.reddit.com/r/Documentaries/comments/34s3s2/the_trials_of_muhammad_ali_2013_alis_toughest/cqy6opc) recently talking about Muhammad Ali and his objection to the draft. It's within the greater context of talking about how Ali then fought to have his conviction overturned, and how it eventually was. It's an interesting story, and I'm not intending to belittle Ali in this. However, the particular comment I linked to goes a step beyond discussing Muhammad Ali. It makes the claim that:\n\n&gt; Dick Cheney and George Bush and Bill Clinton and Al Gore \"dodged\" the draft Muhammad Ali stood on his principles that he wasn't going to serve in a military that was making unjust war against a people that were never and would never be an enemy of his country.\n\nAn interesting claim. And a wrong one. \n\nOne of the contentious issues in deciding who is a \"draft dodger\" and who is not. It's a derisive term, of course, meant to denigrate and deride those who, for whatever reason, don't serve in their country's draft. In the context of the Vietnam War, it applies to a whole host of men who chose to run to Canada, go to prison, or just not show up when they were supposed to, and who did so for a wide variety of reasons. For my post, I'm going to say that a draft dodger is a person who, when called for the draft or when called to register for the draft, does not show up. Feel free to disagree with my definition if you'd like.\n\nIt seems relevant to first talk about Muhammad Ali and his objection to the draft. When Muhammad Ali was initially called on to register for the draft in 1964, he failed the literacy test, and thus wasn't required to register. However, in 1966, the standards were lowered, and he became eligible for the draft, much to his chagrin. Immediately, he expressed his position as a conscientious objector, stating that, as a Muslim, he could not participate in the war as it was against the teaching of the Qur'an. Equally, he objected to it on the basis that he had no real quarrel with the Viet Cong, and that he refused to go shoot people when, in his eyes, the real enemy was the people oppressing blacks in the US. \n\nHis application as a conscientious objector was denied, and on 28 April, 1967, when he appeared for his induction into the army, he refused to step forward when his name was called, constituting draft evasion and leading to his arrest and prosecution. In June of that year, he was convicted of draft evasion, leading to his boxing license being stripped. He appealed the decision, and, in 1971, his conviction was overturned by the Supreme Court in an 8-0 ruling. While they didn't say that he was innocent of draft evasion, per se, the ruling did make it clear that no good reason was given for why his original application for conscientious objector status was rejected, thus meaning that his original conviction wasn't valid. \n\nLikely, what helped in overturning Ali's conviction was the fact that the tide had turned dramatically against the war between the time when Ali was initially arrested and when the Supreme Court overturned the ruling. During that time, he became a bit of a hero for the cause of civil rights and for those who also disagreed with the draft and with the war in Vietnam. His objections and conviction led others to protest more loudly or begin protesting where they previously hadn't been.\n\nIt's well-worth it to look at whether or not Muhammad Ali was actually a conscientious objector before we jump into a discussion of who is and is not a draft dodger. The history of the term and the idea is actually pretty fascinating (did you know the first recorded \"conscientious objector\" was Saint Maximilian in 295 CE? I didn't know that), but in modern terms, the definition that's largely used is that the objector is adamantly and thoroughly opposed to service on the grounds of either freedom of thought, religion, or conscience. Essentially, it's a freedom of expression issue, and the freedom being held is the right to not kill other people. For a conscientious objector to be a conscientious objector rather than a \"meh\" objector, there needs to be a sincere belief that war is bad. \n\nLooking at Muhammad Ali's statements and when he made them, it seems likely to me that he was sincere in his belief that going to war was wrong for religious reasons. He joined the Nation of Islam in 1964, having been mentored and studied with Malcolm X. He'd been under Malcolm X's tutelage for two years prior to that, and had been attending Nation of Islam meetings since 1961. It's enough for me to say that he was probably sincere in his conversion, and sincere in his beliefs that the Viet Cong were less of an enemy than white America. Muhammad Ali, then, was likely a legitimate conscientious objector.\n\nI think, then, we've firmly established that the first five words of the comment in question are historically accurate. Muhammad Ali didn't join the military because of principles, and good for him for doing so. What about the sixth and seventh words, though? Were all these major American politicians really draft dodgers?\n\nWe'll start with Al Gore since he's probably the easiest - no. Al Gore was not a draft dodger. [This article](http://partners.nytimes.com/library/politics/camp/071100wh-gore.html) from the New York Times talks about Gore's service in Vietnam and what exactly his responsibilities were. Al Gore actively sought to enlist rather than being conscripted, unlike everyone else on the list. In 1969, he enlisted with the 20th Engineer Brigade and, in January 1971, was shipped to Bien Hoa where he served as a journalist for five months before being honourably discharged in May 1971. He wasn't on the front lines shooting people, but equally, he wasn't lounging back in an easy chair. His position as a journalist meant he was shuttling around, interviewing soldiers immediately after battles and in positions where he was in very real danger. His work, too, highlighted important perspectives during the war, something that strikes me as rather valuable.\n\nWhat I find particularly interesting about Gore is that, as I said, he is the only one on the list to have actually gone and signed up, but his reasons for doing so are interesting. Gore's father was a fervently anti-war senator during the Vietnam War and, in 1969, he was campaigning for re-election. Gore had just graduated from Harvard, and with his deferment now rendered void, he was left with the choice of what to do. Gore, too, was anti-war, but decided that the best way to help the anti-war effort was to ensure his father's re-election, which his enlistment, he thought, would do. It didn't, but I find the train of logic interesting, and it says quite a bit about Gore's sensibilities and priorities. \n\nWhat's clear, then, is that while Gore may not have had the most dangerous posting of the Vietnam War, he did serve in it, and serve of his own volition. He was not in any way a draft dodger. \n\nLet's look at the next easiest, Dick Cheney. Cheney did not serve in Vietnam, having gotten five deferments over the course of the war. He first became eligible in 1962, but considering conscription was low and that those who were conscripted were generally older, Cheney was not called on to join the military. In 1963, when conscription of younger men increased, he enrolled at Casper Community College, getting the first of his four student deferments. By the time he was finished with school in 1966, his wife was pregnant, and he received a deferment for \"hardship.\" \n\nCheney obviously didn't serve in Vietnam, and the number of deferments he received has, over the course of political career, turned a few heads now and then. However, he still wasn't a draft dodger. He was registered for the draft, but was never called to enlist. By definition, he can't be a draft dodger.\n\nWhat about Bush? Bush is a more interesting case, I think. In 1968, he joined the Texas Air National Guard with a six year commitment. At the time when he joined, there had been debate about whether or not to send the National Guard to Vietnam, an option that both Johnson and Nixon ultimately rejected. What this meant was that, of the roles one could be enlisted into, the Air National Guard was probably one of the safest. There is also evidence that George Bush Sr. used his influence to try and ensure that Bush went into the Air National Guard rather than a more dangerous post. This is not to diminish Bush's time in the military - service is service, after all, when we're looking at whether or not someone dodged the draft -  but it is still an interesting thing.\n\nThe more questionable aspect of Bush's military tenure comes in when one looks at the fact that, in 1972, Bush stopped appearing where he was supposed to when he was supposed to. In May 1972, Bush was working on a senatorial campaign in Alabama despite being assigned to the Texas reserve. He requested a transfer, which was ultimately rejected. However, he was permitted to train elsewhere, something which it can't be verified that he did. Ultimately, he left the Texas reserves in 1973 due to starting school at Harvard, something which has been argued to be an example of him not fulfilling his required six year commitment. Whether or not that's the case is an argument mired in politics.\n\nBush's military career is hardly grand or glorious, but then, nobody ever claimed it was. Bush was never found to be AWOL, suggesting that, despite not being where he was supposed to be, everything was ostensibly okay. Regardless, Bush responded when called upon to enlist by the draft. The fact that that military service didn't involve actual danger or doing what he was told doesn't detract from the fact that he didn't dodge the draft - he served in the military.\n\nThat brings me to Clinton, arguably the most interesting of the bunch. Clinton was fervently anti-war, organising protests throughout his tenure at Oxford. He surrounded himself with conscientious objectors as [this letter](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/clinton/etc/draftletter.html) shows, maintained his utter dislike of the draft, and saw it as an evil and anti-democratic thing. It's abundantly clear that Clinton was not a fan of the Vietnam War. While he was a student at Oxford, he received two deferments, but once he was preparing for law school, those deferments were no longer an option. As he explains in the letter, he started to join the University of Arkansas ROTC as a way to escape the draft, but then didn't attend that. Instead, he registered for the draft, but received a high enough number that he stood no chance of actually being drafted. \n\nWhat I think is most interesting about Clinton is his reasoning behind the choices he made. Obviously enrolling in ROTC as a way out of the draft and then not showing up is rather sketchy at best, but considering his previous activities and personal feelings, his ability and willingness to be a conscientious objector were clearly there. However, he chose not to be a conscientious objector to \"maintain my political viability within the system.\" It's a fascinating decision, and one that puts the question of whether or not he was a draft dodger in a new light. \n\nHe and Ali have quite a bit in common. Both objected to the Vietnam War on thoroughly moral grounds, with Ali objecting to killing people because of politics and his personal religious beliefs, and Clinton objecting due to political and moral beliefs. Both had all the makings of conscientious objectors. However, where Muhammad Ali was willing to take the steps to register and face the consequences when it failed, Clinton was not. Clinton chose instead to register for the draft in order to preserve his political future. \n\nBy the strict definition of the term, Clinton wasn't a draft dodger. By a less strict application, I still don't think he was a draft dodger, though there is absolutely a case to be made, considering he falsely signed up for ROTC and was lucky enough to receive a high number in the draft. Clinton did register for the draft, despite his moral qualms and his anti-war activism. While we may look askance at his motivations, the fact that he did still register, even if he didn't enlist, means he wasn't a draft dodger.\n\nWhat I think is most interesting, though, is /u/HumboldtBlue's implied claim that to truly be anti-Vietnam War, one couldn't serve in the war. What I think both Gore and Clinton illustrate is that they had principles similar to Ali, but expressed them differently, and with different motivations. Both Gore and Clinton were more politically minded than Ali, and recognised the political repercussions of either of them ducking out of the war while other, less connected people died. Indeed, Gore at one point stated that one of his reasons for enlisting was the fact that, if he didn't go, someone else would, and he didn't want that to happen. Both men had their principles, and both were anti-war. They chose to express it differently than Ali, but that doesn't mitigate their principles. \n\nMore reading!\n\n[This is a good article about Cheney's deferments during the draft.](http://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/01/politics/campaign/01CHEN.html)\n\n[The letter Clinton wrote, again, in case you, you know, really want the same link twice](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/clinton/etc/draftletter.html)\n\n[Some more about Gore and his relationship with politics and the military](http://partners.nytimes.com/library/politics/camp/071100wh-gore.html)\n\n[You know I can't go a post without citing some sort of UN document.

        "text": "So, I love reading interviews on old peoples that went through important historical events.\n\nI recently came across this one interview which was obviously fake. In the story, an old couple was talking about how they were avoiding Japanese bombers during WWII...in Taiwan.\n\nYes, you read that right.\n\nFor some short history lesson, Taiwan was a Japanese colony/territory since 1895, all the way into 1945 when the war ended and the Republic of China government occupied it.\n\nIt is literally, impossible for any living person to be bombed by the Japanese intentionally during WW2 in Taiwan. The only time the island would be hostile to Japan, is the First Sino-Japanese War and the subsequent short lived rebellion. (and an earlier incursion to root out pirates, which the diseases killed more Japanese soldiers than anything.)\n\nHere is the offending article, and my shitty translation. I did not translate the video interview, but the description on the end.\n\nhttp://storytaiwan.tw/Story_Detail_c.aspx?n=7D4DCAAB8887E4FD&amp;s=A1138ADDEA9F3951&amp;t=0C4F3E988AC32E69&amp;tn=620F23379DF07C83D63C854481C6BA1E\n\n&gt;**Title: The Days we hid in Air Raid Shelters**\n\n&gt;戴林貴英回想小時候為了躲避日軍空襲，常常躲在防空洞，經常一躲就是一整天，等到天黑才回到家裡。而敵軍沒有來襲時，她就要去田裡幫忙，煮些點心給農作者，也常常工作到一半遇到空襲，大伙就四處逃難去，這些印象都在留在她的腦海裡。\n\n&gt;Mrs. Dailin remembers when she were young, to avoid Japanese bombing she hid in air raid shelters. It often ended up being a whole days affair, and was only able to return home after dark. And when the enemy did not come and bomb, she helps out in the rice field, and cook deserts for the farmers. There were also times where the air raids came half way during their work, everyone scattered around to hide. These stories are all deeply in her head.\n\nSeriously, ~~Misses~~, **Mr. Author**, you either live in an alternative history or I accidentally slipped through time and arrived in an alternative universe. Someone please prove me wrong.\n\n**EDIT: I went through the interview, and the lady never mentions once that the bombers being Japanese, and that the story did happened on the island. She also speaks Taiwanese dialect, so I am inclined to believe she was a Taiwanese that lived through the era and not a Chinese immigrant.**\n\n**The blame now lies on the interviewer/author for making such a huge mistakes that shit on actual people's history.**",

        "text": "Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNg7Go83d7A\n\n\nWhere do I began with this? To start:\n\n\n\"The Difference between a criminal invader and a criminal tyrant is only one of scale\"\n\nNo, actually, it's also one of time, money and manpower. The British had at their disposal some 50,000 troops, whom approximately some one third of which were Hessian mercenaries. Can a home invader afford 15,000 mercenaries? And, time is perhaps the biggest factor of the three, as it took the British months to respond to any large movement the Americans made, and George Washington certainly knew this. Next up:\n\n\"Gun control was being used in the Weimar Republic (which this dumbass pronounces like a W) and Third French Republic as gun *confiscation* once the totalitarians took over\"\n\nFirst off, what's that about totalitarians taking over in France? You mean a puppet state which might as well have been part of Nazi Germany? How is that a totalitarian takeover? It's a foreign force occupying a country and making a puppet state out of it, not a totalitarian regime taking over. Secondly, to get nitpicky,  that *german* soldier in the lower right hand corner is waving a *soviet* flag. Why? Also, I don't really know much about German gun control policies pre-war and on the eastern front, so anyone in comments, please tell me some info on that. Anyway, Next:\n\n\"In fact, every episode of genocide in the past century has been preceded by assiduous efforts to disarm the victims first. Turkish Armenia, The Holocaust, The USSR, Soviet Occupied Poland...\" you see the point here.\n\nFirstly, How on earth is the Holocaust considered a genocide preceded by gun control? All those Jewish shop owners must've had guns for self defence before being robbed, burned and smashed by SA brown-shirts. Second of all, how do you consider the USSR, a country, a genocide? I assume he's talking about the starving of Ukraine, but some elaboration would be great on his part. How does starving out a bunch of Ukrainians because they won't play along with your 'voting' have *anything* to do with gun control of all things? Lastly, the Armenian's were not disarmed, they were deprived of all able bodied men first through execution and forced labour, then followed by marches into the Syrian desert by women, children, old folk and the infirm. Nothing to do with gun control still. Next:\n\n\"Genocidaires (not sure if that's a word) seem to consider gun confiscation a crucial precondition for genocide.\"\n\n\nNope, disproved by last three points. Moving on:\n\n\"What is ultimately at stake is the same question that precipitated the American Revolution, whether the American people are the sovereigns in their own country, or whether they should be ruled from above, for their own good, according to the supposedly benevolent commands of the elitist rulers of a european style society.\"\n\nNot even gonna talk about that because R2.\n\nThat's my second post for the day. Please, discuss in the comments, I'd like to see the opinions here. Also during the intro with that text making the shape of the thirteen colonies, they misspelt Siege. (they spelt it like this: Seige) This might be breaking rule two somewhat, but that's to the discretion of the mods around here. I felt this should be here.",
