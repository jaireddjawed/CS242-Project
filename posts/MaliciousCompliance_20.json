        "text": "This is a current ongoing MC. My landlord is also my roommate. I rent the bonus room above a 2 car garage in a 3 bedroom house. So me and my boyfriend, my landlord, and 2 other roommates all live here. It technically belongs to my landlords mother. She has POA while her mother is in a nursing home recovering from a stroke. She has this very strict rule that no one is to adjust the thermostat but her. Which since everyones rent includes all utilities is fair as long as she is reasonable about things. However when the house was built my room was not insulated as well as it should have been. As a result it's the hottest room in the summer and the coldest in the winter ( I need a space heater when it hits mid thirties or lower). Additionally the way the central air and heat are set up is less then ideal. There is only 1 return vent for the entire floor which is in the hall.\n\nAnyway last night we got into an argument about various things. It should be noted she doesn't have a job. Her entire income comes from renting the rooms as well as food stamps. She also lies to SS about her income just to get the food stamps. She spends her days sitting on her ass talking on the phone or trolling Facebook while watching tv. She thinks because she is the landlord she shouldn't have to clean anything at all or take out the trash. She got mad that no one took the cans to the end of the driveway for the collection last week. I had finally had enough and snapped and told her she had no room to complain because in the 2 years I have lived here she has never once taken it out. That lead in to other shit like her not cleaning etc.  She lives here full time she should take part in the cleaning and trash removal just as much as the rest of us. For the rest of this you should remember I'm not the only one affected by her \"punishment\" there are other roommates.\n\nAnyway she feels like she is right and I am wrong. So to \"punish\" me she turned the temp up on the ac to 77 knowing My room would hit 90 before the ac turned on. Well on a normal summer day this would have been true. But it's been very cloudy and rainy here lately. It was only 78 outside today. She then proceeded to leave for the entire day. However because today it only hit 78 and was insanely humid the entire house turned into a sauna(not hot per-say but humid as all get out). So the rest of my roommates and I used our box fans and ceiling fans to circulate air out into the hall where the thermostat was. This triggered it to turn on and run. So not only was the ac running but all of our ceiling fans and about 5 box fans were running non stop for hours on end. But it gets better. Because she set the thermostat at 77 the ac kept turning on and off so the house never got cool. This meant it was using the electric all damn day. Running up the bill. Plus she came home and her room was like an oven so she had to turn the thermostat down to cool it off, Running the bill up even more. \n\nSo now she has run up her electric bill at the very least 3 times as much and pissed off the rest of the roommates. We were all on the verge of moving out en mass before this. At least 1 is threatening to give her notice on the 1st over this. My BF and I are ready to go we are just holding out a couple more months till we can get our ducks in a row and find a place.\n\n\nTL:DR Landlord/Roommate tries to punish me and ends up pissing off other roommates and running up her electric bill all to try and prove she was right when she was very wrong.",

This place was one of the larger ones in the country.  Chances are you have items of theirs in your homes.\n\nThis place was super disorganized.  Theft ran rampant and management was largely ineffective.  Anyone who worked there will tell you it was and still is chaos.\n\nEnter this guy who we'll call Dave.  Dave was a forklift driver and was totally unhinged.  On one occasion he stole the groundskeeper's old rusty snowblower.  When it was reported \"missing\" the company bought a brand new one to replace it.  Our buddy dave drives up one night and swaps it out for the old one he stole and keeps the brand new one.  Stories like this were not uncommon.  \n\nOne day the plant is super backed up on shipments.  For some reason the warehouse is full and no trucks have arrived to grab anything.  The supervisor on the floor had his small office in the middle of the warehouse with a large plate glass window.  Dave was running put of places to put pallets so he started to stack them on the floor and racking in front of the supervisors office.  The supervisor was irate \"YOU CANT PUT STUFF HERE, I NEED A CLEAR LINE OF SIGHT TO WATCH THE PRODUCTION LINES FROM MY WINDOW!!\"\n\nDave tried explaining there was literally nowhere in the building to put these pallets.  The only thing obstructed was the supervisors view, there was still an ample walking path and there were no safety hazards.  No exits or paths were blocked.\n\nIt was then the boss made a big mistake \"I DONT CARE WHERE YOU PUT THEM, JUST DON'T PUT THEM HERE!!\"   Anywhere?  Yes, anywhere, i dont care.\n\nDave spent the next 6 hours taking pallets of finished product and dumping then in a 20 yard dumpster on the dock behind the production lines.  \n\nThe most bizarre part is that according to my coworker, the loss went unnoticed by management and literally nothing ever happened to either party.  I find this totally ridiculous.",

The one thing he ALWAYS did was when teachers passed assignments or homework around. We were a big class of 26 (limit is my country), so there was a lot of furniture to navigate if you want to deliver each student a piece of paper. So in the interest of time-saving, usually the teacher would pass all copies to the nearest student and tell him or her to \"Take one and pass along the rest\". Sometimes, however, this was abbreviated to \"Take one and pass along\", but we all understood what was meant. Well, you can guess what happened when the stack passed my friend's desk. He took one, and pass that one along, leaving the rest on his desk. This resulted in spending some minutes figuring out why some suddenly didn't have a copy. Incidentally, this is where my friend practiced his poker face. He was of cause \"busted\" on it and send the rest of the copies along when the teacher found out. They quickly learned to be very specific when they had him in their class.\n\nTL;DR: If you can't even read a story this short, why are you on Reddit?!",

        "text": "Long-time lurker, first-time poster. Sorry if formatting is weird, but I started this on mobile and decided that was a mistake.\n\nA few years ago, I worked in a small pizza bar - mostly bar, but with a tiny kitchen serving pizza, Phillies, and some other sandwiches and fried apps. There were no servers, food runners, bussers, hosts/hostesses, and most times no manager. The shifts usually included just one bartender and two of us kitchen guys running the entire show, and it was always a shitshow because the place is VERY popular (about 70% of Yelp reviews include some variant of the word \"understaffed\"). Patience was very scarce up front in the kitchen, because as cooks, we had to take orders, run the register, answer the phone to take pick-up orders, run to the fax machine for those god-awful third-party delivery companies (looking at you, GrubHub), run the food out to tables, bus the tables, run dishes from the front kitchen through the entire hallway of a bar to the prep kitchen in the back, and run from the walk-in in the back up to the front to restock the line, all while keeping track of food cooking on the grill, in the fryer, and in the ovens, and assembling said food. So yes, it was a nightmare of an operation, and even if we had more hands on deck, we wouldn't have had enough space on the deck for those hands.\n\nWe had a few deals set up to save the customer money on their orders, and one was \"the Ultimate\" - it was a pizza with six toppings of any kind, and it was priced based on the size of the pizza, whereas normally, different toppings were priced differently according to the type of topping and the size of the pizza (i.e. sausage would be $2.00 on an 18\" pie or $3.00 on a 24\" pie, but onions would be $1.00 on an 18\" or $1.50 on a 24\". You get it.). Basically, \"the Ultimate\" came with six toppings, all priced as if they were the cheapest-possible topping.\n\nWhile dealing with the crazy shitstorm of customers waiting in line to order, phones ringing, and food almost burning behind me on the grill, there was very little time available (read: none) to get into an actual conversation or debate with a customer. However, fairly regularly, I would answer a call for a pick-up order, the customer wouldn't know what they wanted, would ask me to list the 30+ toppings available, and then piece together their perfect pizza over several minutes. Many times, they wanted a pizza with six toppings, so I would ring it up as an Ultimate to save them several dollars - this took extra time, as I would have to void the original entry in the register, put it in as an Ultimate instead, and then key in each topping a second time. Almost every single time I did this, after reading back the order to them, they would complain that they didn't want the Ultimate, they just wanted a pizza with six toppings. I would explain that it was the same thing, but I put it in as an Ultimate because it was just a much cheaper way to get the exact same result. A remarkably small portion of these customers thanked me for saving them anywhere between $8-15, while the vast majority demanded that I change it, because they didn't want to pay for an Ultimate. I went ahead and changed it back, gave them their new (much higher) total, and was always met with a timid \"umm, ok,\" as the gears finally started turning in their brains.\n\nMany of these people came in, paid the higher price, and then left a decent tip, I'd assume because they realized how horribly stubborn and rude they had been on the phone.\n\nTL;DR: People wanted an overloaded pizza, I tried to discount it by ringing it in differently. They thought I was getting their order wrong, so they snapped at me and ended up paying the higher price.\n\nPSA: When you're requesting something from an employee, that employee is the expert in what they do - berating them over something you probably aren't understanding is a good way to ensure that they will no longer want to make things easier for you.",

Fortunately, I didn't have to work directly with her as her office was on another floor.

Do you have any coffee in here?!\" The other two trainers and I say, \"No, sorry.\"  \n\nShe insists that she must have coffee, and spies the coffee urn in the supply nook and says, \"Oh, is there any coffee in there?\" and she goes over to it and eyes the gauge just as I realize that I had forgotten to empty and clean the urn the Friday before!\n\n\"Oh, there is coffee in here! I'll just have some of this and heat it in the microwave!\"\n\n\"No!!! I forgot to empty this last Friday, please don't drink that!\"\n\n\"Gimme that coffee!\" She didn't say it that way, but my office mates and I jumped out of her way and let her have her way. \n\nI waited a few minutes until she'd heated up that nasty shit and pulled the urn and cart to the kitchen.

(She had us watch guardians of the galaxy in class to teach us about archetypes and used dungeons and dragons for another lesson. She also had us read Candide by Voltair for \"fun\" - no quizzes no essays, just a time waster. Not fun.) She used vague rubrics and I could never tell how to improve my essays. We got absolutely NO feeback and had no idea what we were doing. \n\nShe also shoved her interpretations down our throats. She would say \"there is no one right answer, everyone interprets things differently!\" Then go on to say that my answer wasn't quite right and someone else's was. \n\nShe had us read Into the Wild to teach us about transcendentalism and finding yourself - particularly through nature. So she had us write an essay about a time we went into nature and came out a better person or grew spiritually. \n\nI could tell that what she wanted was for us to write an essay on how we went on a hike/climbed a mountain and had a new appreciation for nature/the world (she hinted at it and the essay description she handed out said that in fancy terms.) I was sick of not being able to feel like I was learning and that I couldn't get any feedback from the vague rubrics so I decided to write about a hunting trip I went on where I shot my first elk. I described it all in great detail, right up until we walked up to the downed elk. I wrote about how I had felt, how proud I was to put meat on the table for my family. I wrote that because I went out into nature to go hunting, I had grown as a person. \n\nI actually wanted a bad grade because my essay was different than the cookie cutter ones she had asked for. (I was sick of writing rhetorical analysis essays on poems, paintings, and short stories.) In the past I had gotten lower grades for writing my interpretation which was \"wrong\" so I expected my interpretation of transcendentalism to be wrong as well.\n\nWhen I got my essay back, I immediately thought she didn't like reading what I had written. Usually she left a few grammar error notes or her reactions - if she liked your essay - stuff like that. My essay had nothing written on it, just some quickly drawn circles around where I had scored on the rubric. It was like she wanted to get my essay done and over with! She gave me the same grade as all my other papers too, so to this day I wonder if she hated reading my essay or if she was just in a hurry and didn't read it. ",

        "text": "A few years ago I took a summer class for a course in college that was meant to teach us a software called \"[software brand] [software name].\" The summer classes in our college were very compressed so like a course that would usually be around 9 hours a week during a regular semester turned into about 22 hours a week for 3 months during our summer. The professor that taught us was usually pretty chill and cool most of the time but sometimes he had these weird rules that mildly annoyed me and other students.\n\nSome weird rules were:\nWe had quizzes at the start of the day around 7am and some late students won't be able to take the quiz. He could just schedule the quiz a little later since our class was from 7am to 6pm. He wanted to schedule the quiz early so students would come in early.\n\nAnother time he added extra points to the quiz but only if you wrote the complete date of the day we took the quiz so not a lot of us got extra points.\n\nThese are just some of the weird things my professor did but most of the time he was actually a good teacher. Now on to the MC. During the final weeks of the course he wanted us to submit an essay explaining all the things we learned in the course and needed to be 200 words me being the lazy student that I am got really annoyed that after working hard on a final project, now I had to write an essay and email it to our professor. So I write an essay but every time I write the name of the software we learned, I wrote \"[software brand] [software name] [software title] [software version]\" and I try to mention it as much as possible to add up tje word count since I learned a lot from it. Our professor ended up reading all the essays from his email in front of the whole class and actually laughed at what I wrote.\n\nTL;DR:\nWe were required to write a 200 word essay for a class where we had to learn about a certain software so I wrote the whole name of the software as much as possible to reach the word count.",

I’ve been at my new branch for a week now, and customers are pretty wacky so far! \n\nToday, a middle aged lady named Cheryl (name changed) came in to pick up her car, and was furious from the minute she walked in the door. She slams her reservation papers on the counter and demands me to “explain myself”. I smile, and reach my hand out for a handshake to introduce myself (as I do with all my customers). She stares at me, and says she doesn’t have time for “this nonsense”. Alrighty, apparently I have some “explaining to do”.\n\nCheryl was upset that her 6 day car rental, Saturday to Friday, was being charged at the weekly rate of $260, even though she only has it for 6 days. I explained that this rate benefits her, because anywhere from 5-7 days is the same price. To get the daily rate, you take the weekly rate and divide it by 5.  I offered to extend the rental to a full 7 days to take advantage of our weekly rate, and then she went on to tell me that she doesn’t need it for 7 days, but only for 6, and that I better give her the daily rate instead of the weekly rate, or she will never do business with us again. I smile, and say, “Of course I can do that! Your new total is $312”.  Cheryl smiles condescendingly and says “See, that wasn’t so hard! I know that you’re probably not used to us older people with more life experience than you asking the difficult questions, but we’re used to paying attention to the details in order to not get ripped off!” \n\nDumbfounded that she didn’t get upset at the HIGHER price, I walked her to her vehicle, and sent her on her way!\n",

        "text": "Had a memory kick me in the head after reading  [**u/LavertuJS**](https://www.reddit.com/user/LavertuJS) post about a science teacher and supportive parents.\n\nYes, yes; High School Malicious Compliance- but I'll say this is more my mother's petty revenge and my MC at my mother's direction.\n\nIt's the second half of my freshman year of Public High School (a.k.a. 9th Grade for me in the U.S. or April of 2005 for everyone else), and all of the incoming freshmen were pre-assigned two scientific classes to achieve minimum requirements for the local University. The problem is that the school board/teacher/whomever started this system with my year class, and had to overload some teachers with the new \"Physical Systems\" and \"Chemical Systems\" classes. (Spoiler- The Local University didn't consider these classes \"science\" based, but we learned that later.)\n\nSo, it's Chemistry and Physics for Dummies, being taught by teachers that had maybe Minors in the subjects they were teaching, to a total class size of NINE-HUNDRED-AND-TEN. No teacher got to know any student that well.\n\nMy 'Physical Systems\" teacher was a biology teacher normally, and Mr. H had wanted to end the class with a topic/project he thought we would like (and would be easy for him to grade), that would represent 15% of our final grade in the class. We were assigned a planet in our solar system (yes, Pluto included), and we had to make a poster-board highlighting the facts of our assigned planet. I don't remember which one I was assigned (Neptune or Uranus), but I do remember working semi-hard on it. Following the project guidelines and requirements (including that he would be checking for plagiarism), to the letter.\n\nMild side note- I love science, and really loved it in High School. I was a perfectionist, and I meticulously pre-planned every class I needed to get me the best scholarships to get the best degree in science I could. Both of my parents supported me in this, as they were marginal High School Graduates with no Higher Education Degrees, and I understood that their lives were much harder because of that fact. Half of my reason to do well was to pay them back with my salary so they could go on those trips they might not afford otherwise (though they don't know that part of the plan).\n\nBack to this Planetary Poster project; I wrote down the facts precisely, but not verbatim from the books/websites I used. I knew I would forget if I had a direct quote from my material, so I ALWAYS rephrased sentences from primary sources in my notes. But, I knew I would have points deducted for my absolutely abysmal spelling and barely legible handwriting. So I used the family computer's Word Document to type up, then print out, my rephrased facts.\n\nI cut, glued, embellished with acrylic paints, and protected with laminate, this poster board. I wanted this project to succeed. And despite some of my classmates forgetting until the day it was due to make their poster (literally writing it up as the teacher was collecting the project), I hoped to get close to full points for it.\n\nFast forward a week, and we all get the projects back- the kid that scribbled on his board the day of? 70%- my best friend's 100%... Me?... Zero%?\n\n*What? What? What?* I blanked. I don't recall what happened directly after that point, but I do remember going up to the teacher at the end of class and asking why I got a zero.\n\nMr H: I told you not to plagiarize. \n\nMe: But, I didn't.\n\nMr. H: Everything you gave me was typed facts from a website.\n\nMe: Sir, I made sure it wasn't!\n\nMr. H: The phrasing is too academic for a fifteen year old, you cheated.\n\nMe: I swear, I didn't!\n\n Somehow the conversation ended, and I was eventually home crying like a baby to my Mom and Dad. Trying to explain the *worst grade* I had ever gotten in school. My parents, who had watched me get excited putting this poster together, were not pleased with anything to do with Mr. H.\n\nEnter, my Mother, who was having none of this teacher's excuses. My mother, who worked casino security, and knew all of the Principals' by Name (she graduated from the same HS twenty years earlier, when all the Principals had been Coaches). Apparently raining down holy hell upon Mr. H, the Department Head, and the Head Principal. The next afternoon, I was informed by my mother that she had settled things with Mr. H.\n\nBasically, it boiled down to he had no proof I had cheated (he gave me back the poster), and my record was littered with Academic Awards; and since there had been so many projects to grade, mine did not stick out in his mind to find proof of my cheating via his website from memory alone. So, Mr. H treated this situation as if I had not turned in the poster on time (Minus 10 points automatically), and I could turn in a \"Late\" poster the next day for, at most, 90%. I was mildly upset, but that was better than a zero.\n\nMy mother then handed my a blank poster-board and said, \"Copy everything down exactly as it was the first time, even draw the planet with a pen the same way.\" She didn't want me to change a word, a phrase, a comma. NOTHING. I was to chicken scratch my typed out highlights  exactly as they had been on the first poster.\n\nAnd, I got the 90% on the second poster. (Though, I guess Mr. H could have been scared of my mother and didn't want to risk angering her further, but I will live in my own dream land here).\n\nTL;DR- Teacher gave me a Zero on a project because I had typed everything out and \"sounded too academic\" to not be cheating. My mother raises hell over it, then tells me to copy my first project exactly, just free-handed; I got a 90% on the second project.",

        "text": "TL:DR Told off because of  a hickey, so go full evangelical Mormon crusader.\n\nRight, I work at a cafe on a farm (yeah I know a bit weird) and while I don’t usually work in the cafe, I’m normally helping the farmhands, cooks or kitchen porters, sometimes I have to come out and help in front of house, serving hot food. I’m not amazing at this but I can be relied on when it’s busy to just get on with it. \n\nAfter about 15 minutes the owner  pulls me aside who I’ll call, Mark. Mark was incredibly religious and hosted regular bible groups in the cafe on Sundays. He also had a list of 10 values he wanted all his employees to follow (yeah like Moses.) \n\nDespite this he tries desperately hard to make his business modern and up to date which included hiring quite a few teenagers, like myself. You can already see how this contradiction can cause problems. \n\nA great example is when I’m in the cafe, helping out, and I have a hickey on my neck, low down and hardly visible.\n\nHe pulls me over and tells me off for ‘displaying too much.’ For reference I was wearing a shirt buttoned all the way up and a black apron on top. He continued to tell me to ‘act more conservative for work.’ He made it really clear I’d be fired if this happened again. Kinda pissed off I accepted it because yeah, it’s a little unprofessional and I don’t want to get in trouble.\n\nThen I hear later he’s been shit talking me, like really bad shit talking. I’ve had to leave early a few times to look after my little brother, cook his dinner, make sure he goes to bed, take him to his judo class, cause my Moms been out working, and I have had to tell the owner this. He’s been talking behind my back about how I’m from a ‘broken home’ so it makes sense I don’t have the ‘right’ values. Anyone who is/was raised by a single parent can tell you how untrue and hurtful his can be.\n\nThe next day I come in looking like I’ve walked out of a church pamphlet. Hair pressed, glasses neat and uniform spotless. The owner was overjoyed to see this and told me to help out in the cafe. \n\nI spent the next 4 hours harassing kissing couples, asking a single mom how’d she’d raise her kid in a broken house, and regularly telling of my fellow employees for using the Lords name in vain. \n\nMy fellow employees knew what I was doing and were fine with it, laughing and playing along. In the middle of my shift I got pulled aside by my manager and told he has had to give out a lot of money in refunds and free coffees because of my actions. He went on to tell me not to bother coming in for the rest of my shifts.\n\nI’d already been looking for new jobs so this was just the perfect excuse.\n\nI’ve heard he’s been finding it really hard hiring a replacement and shaking the reputation the cafe now has.",

        "text": "So this takes place in my first year of high school in Canada.\n\nI had this science teacher that was... Not great, to say the least. The type of person who said \"its not my fault you arent smart enough\" to a girl when asked to explain a concept in a different way. You get the idea.\n\nFast forward to about half way into the school year, we are taking a basic chemistry exam and this question shows up: \"Is tap water pure or a solution?\" Obviously it's a solution because of all the particules, dissolved gasses, etc. So I write that down but! Being a cocky little shit I also decide to add a fun little scientific fact too:\n\n\"If it was pure water, it could freeze at -40C\"\n(This is called supercooling)\n\nAnd I turn the exam in. A few days later I get the copy back and surprise surprise... The answer is marked as incorrect, despite me having the right answer. So during the break, I go up to her and ask her why I was incorrectly graded, to which she replies: \"The extra you wrote is not true, so you lost points.\" I try to explain that according to French scientists published in the review of the french national research council (a pretty damn reputable place), it IS true, but she doesn't budge.\n\n\nSo what do I do on the next day? You bet I bring the magazine with the specific passage highlighted! She reads it quickly and hits me with one of the most whack-ass lines I've ever heard: \"You wont learn this in college, so it's not true.\"\n\nKeep in mind that she's saying this with a copy of the direct proof in her hand!\n\nKnowing I wont win, I give up on the point I lost and go back to class. That night I tell my parents and they are HIGHLY unimpressed with her behavior, but not willing to put my grades at risk by antagonizing her, we agree to let it go.\n\n\nFast forward to the parent-teacher meetings.\n\nWe decide to not bring it up, stay civil and spend the least amount of time possible with her.\n\nThe meeting goes as expected, blah blah, nothing much is said, all is good. She asks me if there's anything I would like to add (with no bad intentions) and I just say \"nah, I'm good\". And then she hits me with that oh so sweet line:\n\n\"Are you SURE there's nothing you want to talk about?\"\n\nI pause a few seconds, glance at my parents, smile and say:\n\n\"WELL! If you insist...\"\n\nAt this point I know my parents have my back 100%. Both are from a scientific background and found her actions pathetic at best.\n\nSo I ask her: \"Why did you insist on removing points from my exam when everything I wrote was true AND I brought you the evidence to prove so?\"\n\nHer face at that point was so perfect, a truly beautiful rendition of the \"oh shit I'm fucked aren't I\" face.\n\nShe tries to come up with a bullshit answer and my parents RIP into her. My dad was especially pissed talking about how he would've given a student MORE points for going further beyond, how it was an intellectual disgrace to claim that something isn't true because you wouldn't learn it in college. It was glorious.\n\n\nShe squirms in her chair, trying to come up with a justification and failing until the allotted time passes. We get up and I give her the greatest shit eating grin I could muster, as to say: \"you asked for it bitch!\".\n\n\nI never got anything else than a perfectly objective, by the book, black and white grading after that. She never addressed me by name for the rest of the year.\n\nThe irony is that I DID end up learning about supercooling in college.",

The year this happend in was very rainy and the fence collapsed in one section.  Now uncle takes pride in his property and had been trying for years to get to get permission from his neighbour to repair it.\n\nThe day after the fence collapsed the neighbour came over and screamed at my uncle that he had to replace the fence because that the thing was an eyesore.  My uncle was pissed, but because the fence was now dangerous he agreed if the neighbour covered half the materials totalling about a grand.  The neighbour did not agree, and said \"you're going to replace the fence and use my contractor or I'm going to call my cousin in the City (by-law compliance) and he'll make you replace it.\"\n\nMy uncle told him to call the City and slammed the door in his face.  Of course a by-law official shows up a few days later and give my uncle a notice that he had to replace or remove the fence in a month or be fined.  After carefully questioning the official and was told that it is only required to have a fence around your property if you have a pool.  So the day before reinspection my uncle and cousins took it down.\n\nThe neighbour freaked out and screamed at my uncle that he had to replace it because he had a pool.  My uncle looked him dead in the eye and said, \"not my problem, I'm in full compliance with the City just like you wanted.\"\n\nI found out because I went over with my mom to hang out and were greeted with sight of the neighbour trying to pour concrete footings in the rain.\n\nTLDR:  neighbour doesn't let uncle repair fence and calls by-law compliance on uncle, resulting in uncle removing fence causing neighbour to be fined by the City",

The HoS rules are so Byzantine and impenetrable, that they might as well have been crafted by Anthemius.  A full explanation would need animated diagrams and, preferably, narration by John McLeish, but the ELI5 explanation is that all freight drivers have to keep track of four clocks:  \n  \n* Drive Clock:  11 hours, only counts down while behind the wheel.  Resets after a 10-hour break.\n* Duty Clock:  14 hours, counts down when you first go on-duty, and doesn't stop or reset until you complete a 10-hour break.  \n* Break Clock: 8 hours, counts down when you first go on-duty, and doesn't stop or reset until you complete a half-hour break.\n* Weekly Clock:  70 hours, a sum of all time driving or on-duty for the past 8 days or since your last 34-hour break (can also be 60 hours/7 days).\n  \nIf any of those clocks run out, you can no longer drive until you take the appropriate break.  Of course, these are only the rules until they aren't, and the regulations have more loopholes than Himeji Castle.  \n  \nFor instance, I am considered a short haul driver, which means that in exchange for a number of restrictions on how and where I drive, I don't have to keep my own time log or keep track of my Drive Clock...unless I work more than 12 hours, in which case I do.  I am still limited by the 14-hour duty clock, though once per week I can extend that to 16 hours.  Still, company policy is not to load drivers after they hit 12 hours; it's safest that way.  \n  \nThat brings us to Gary, my dispatcher.  My old dispatcher, [Jack](https://www.reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/8xwayi/dispatch_said_to_go_so_i_went/) had been dumped on scheduling for playing games with how he dispatched drivers.  Gary apparently never got that memo.  I have met dispatchers who were former drivers.  They tend to have a solid idea of the realities of driving.  Gary was not one of those dispatchers.  Gary saw the world through his tracking map, which didn't bother with inconsequential things, like traffic or elevations.  Trucks were just little blips on his board, and he seemed to delight in moving those blips around.  Gary thought of himself as a prankster and a wit.  If he had known the word, he might have described himself as puckish.  If his drivers had known the word, they would have thought it was one letter off.  \n  \nAnd that is how I end up in Corona, CA at 1pm on a Friday afternoon.  I call Gary and tell him that I'm at 11.5 hours, and I need to start heading back.  Gary needs me to take another load; their local plant is closed, and I'm the only driver available at a neighboring plant.  I pull under, figuring that this is going to be somewhere in Riverside...maybe San Bernardino or Moreno Valley, somewhere vaguely in the direction I am going, that will let me get my grumble on, without actually delaying me too much.  \n  \nIt's in Tustin.  Tustin is not on my way home; it is the opposite direction, on the other side of a weigh station.  And, of course, I am at a plant with no scale, because trying to send loaded trucks through the Santa Ana Canyon is the kind of employee management you'd normally expect only in Dickens' most unhinged laudanum dreams.  Still, Dispatch wants me to go...  \n  \nI call my manager, Bob, before I leave to let him know what just happened, and that someone is going to have to collect the truck (and me) after this job.\n  \nI'm certainly not going to brave the Scale Goblins without being able to check my load, so it's time to partake in the time honored trucker pastime of dodging the weigh station.  I have to go 20 miles out of route and drive through the Orange Crush (which is as much fun on a Friday afternoon as it sounds) to reach the job (for those who live in the area, it meant taking the 71 to the 60, then coming back down the 57).  The job, itself goes off without a hitch, but now it's after 3pm.  I have half an hour before I can no longer legally drive, and I am on the wrong side of the Santa Ana Canyon, which at this hour is moving at about the same speed as my aunt on her Rascal.  \n  \nI call Gary to let him know that I won't be making back to my home plant, and he sounds a little cowed.  It turns out Bob called the regional manager, and the regional manager called the operations manager...the operations manager called Gary (from what I gather, he called him many things).  Gary asks, practically pleading, if I can make it back by 16 hours.  I can't, not through the traffic I'm facing, but that's a moot point; with malicious cheerfulness I remind him that I blew my 16-hour exception on Tuesday, when he decided to send me on a late-afternoon run up to Joshua Tree.  I've got just enough time to get my truck someplace safe and park it.  When they figure out how to get me back, they'll find me at the Crab Cooker just off the 55 Fwy in Tustin.  \n  \nThere had been several night pours the previous night; that was why I had started at 1:30am.  As a result, they don't have anyone with the hours to make the round trip out to Tustin and back, not during rush hour.  In the end they find a rock-hauler who had a tanker endorsement on his license (mixers need a Class B license with tankers; rock trucks need Class A with doubles/triples) coming on for night shift.  Bob offers to drive him out and bring me back.  By the time I clocked out, I am over 18 hours for the day.  Bob got overtime for the trip out and back, and he told me to just stay home Saturday.  Last I heard, Gary had been moved from dispatch to IT.  \n  \nTL/DR:  Dispatch decides to send me on a job I won't be able to make it home from.  I do the job, reach the point I can no longer legally drive, then rack up massive overtime, while eating clam chowder and waiting for my ride home.",

        "text": "Preface by stating this happened a week ago\n\nI'm a highschool senior and we're always looking for some more money to fund our endeavours. I got a job serving at a popular restaurant and generally the people are nice. My bosses are the three children of the owner (who my family is particularly close to) and two of them are a joy to work with. They're both kind, flexible people and really put a sense of \"I love working here because they are so good to me\". And then you have the third one, mean, condescending, and generally not that great of a person to work with. For the purposes of this story we'll call him Alex. \n\nAs you can probably tell, I got stuck with that third one on a busy day. After the surge of people that come in for lunch halts, there's a bit of grey area and usually there are about 20 people that come in between those hours. During that time we prep for dinner service, and I was just doing exactly that. The sink was filled due to the busy lunch and I was clearing it when a customer comes in, and i hear Alex say \"hello!\". My back was turned while doing dishes because that's how the floor is layed out and i didnt see them walk in. Alex seats the customer and comes back towards me. Now, I wasn't particularly on his good side (but then again, no one really was ever on his good side) and i swear he dreads working with me. This is the following conversation:\nA: Why didn't you greet the customer?\nMe: Because i didnt hear or see them come in, and I thought you could handle the front without me doing things like that.\nA: Just because I greet them doesn't mean you don't have to, alright?\nMe: Okay, my bad.\nA: You've been working here a month, I expect you to do everything on your own, and now I'm expecting that you say \"Hello\" and \"Thank you\" to every single person that walks through that doorway.\nMe: Alright got it.\nFast forward a couple of hours to dinner service and it getting really busy. Alex stuck me behind the counter while he and the other more experienced server went to do other things. periodically people leave the restaurant for smoke breaks and come back in. So everytime someone left, they were going through the doorway. Every single time, without fail, I would yell \"Thank you!\" or \"Hello!\" to whoever walked in or out. Needless to say, our tips weren't that great that day. Alex got extremely angry with me and asked why I was doing what i was doing and I told him exactly what he asked of me, greeting and thanking every customer. He told me to cut it out, and it was a work place joke for a while\n\nTL;DR Unpleasant coworker told me to greet people everytime they walked through the doorway, so I did. ",

        "text": "This one has finally been over turned because of me.\n\nMy boss likes to send emails. 1 minute late? Yup, you get that email stating even 1 minute is late. Leave at 11:15pm instead of 11:30? Yup, you get the email, \"Your shift is until 11:30 and you must stay until that time.\"\n\nIn my department we only have a set number of computers and usually all are taken up on each shift. So while doing our turn over process that happens anywhere from 11 to 11:30 we will systematically switch employees out. There is a reason the computer I sit at always has someone on it. It's the best. Why? Because I actually clean up the system with defrags, cleanup tool, deleting useless old files, etc.\n\nI work on computers. It's what I do. Almost none of my job is off the computer. So what do I do for my last 30-45 minutes while not a computer? I would read. I rolled my chair directly in front of my managers desk where I would be out of the way and bust out my book and just read. (I was allowed to read on the clock so I would keep my noise hole shut. I'm a talker.)\n\nWell this bugged my boss to no end and told me I could no longer read during turnover. Alright, fair enough. Then I started playing Final Fantasy Tactics on my phone. That got squashed real quick. Then I would just step out and take a 3rd walk around our building. (We were allowed 2 on the clock) That also got squashed as, \"I had to be in the Command Center in case someone has a question.\"\n\nMy shift is on point and we would have 3rd shift up and running at 11 every night. So I had 30 minutes where I couldn't do anything. So I did what I was best at. I talked. To the point where my manager saw that now even 3rd shift wasn't doing their work.\n\nThis lasted about a week until he changed the rules saying once turnover is done we were free to leave as long as 3rd shift was ok with it.\n\nThey give 0 fucks.\n\nEDIT - Woah this blew up! I'll answer the few repetitive responses. No I am not required to sit at the same computer all the time and could totally \"unfuck\" all the machines in a day if I felt like it but if they audited my ID I would quickly be written up and/or fired for going against policy. HR does not care why I do something. They care I did not follow policy. They are not here for me. They are here for the company. It's unfortunate but true.\n\nNo, I should not have admin access and even running a defrag is against policy because there is a department dedicated to handling the maintenance on computers but they despise spending their entire day just cleaning up machines when they could be fixing real problems.\n\nNo they don't track how many times I go around the building lol but day shift has this \"Walk for health\" program where they get an hour a day to go walk around the building and BS. So my manager allows us to take an hour at night since we do not get that opportunity. I just know that 2 laps around my building at a leisurely pace takes about 45 minutes to an hour. (2ish miles?) I just do it for mental health and to not be staring at a computer screen.\n\nEDIT2 - I should also mention I am the lowest pay grade in my department but am treated like a lead due to learning our systems. It's unfortunate but true. I am the only normal tech expected to run a shift without a senior, lead, or manager present.",

Now let me start with the fact that city, state and federal agencies usually give me a headache to begin with. I have been working to file an application with DMH for a client and the woman processing the application has been a nightmare to work with. She never answers her phone. Will not return my messages. She has consistently not gotten back to me, straight up ignored me, and actually hung up on me twice.\n \nSo, being a nightmare soulless bitch, she denied my client’s application and probably thought she was going to be rid of me. Not the case. I am fighting her decision, now being backed by my supervisor and her boss.\n \nNow, I reached out to her yesterday regarding medical records that she had never bothered to collect, so obviously she never reviewed them in making her decision. These records lend heavily to the argument of the appeal, and may have prevented him from being rejected in the first place had she bothered. I informed her that I had collected the records and would like her to look them over. She stated that the records would need to be faxed to her. Mind you, I keep all of my files electronically and would need to print them out to be able to send them over fax. I then asked her if I could please send them in a secure e-mail instead (I like to save paper anywhere and everywhere that I can). She stated that she does not have a secure e-mail (I have a hard time believing a state employee does not have access to secure e-mail) and reiterated that I would need to fax the paperwork. If you have not worked with medical records, they are typically hefty.\n \nI reluctantly spent my morning printing out hundreds of pages of medical records. I then proceeded to fax them to the tree-killing bitch. Skip to a few hours after I begin this process. She calls and has the audacity to tell me to stop faxing her things! I have been tying up her fax machine all morning! If I had anymore files to send, I HAVE to mail them!\n \nI casually informed her that I was just following the instructions that she gave me and that if she wanted them mailed, she should have said so. I did not stop faxing. Guess she’ll just have to wait! \n\nTL;DR - nightmare soulless tree-killer decides not to help homeless man due to her laziness. I appeal, she doesn't want records emailed, only faxed. Faxed her the 100's of pages of records, occupying her fax machine for hours.\n\nUPDATE: I have spoken to my supervisor and now have the knowledge that I was looking for to ELECTRONICALLY FAX! I can save trees on my end in the future!! ",

Sometimes we’d schedule our squads or platoons to train down at this site and run through all kinds of scenarios. Not too many people were certified to use the program and connect/set up all of the gear. Itwas kind of a pain in the ass to go down there because only the guys who worked in the building were able to set it all up. But with myself getting certified, we could just go down there whenever we wanted. \n\nNobody really took the training seriously, it seemed like it was more for non combat roles to play with guns and run through static scenarios. But the non combat soldiers who worked in the building...they took it seriously. Super serious. And they generally did not like when infantry units came to train because we were always joking around and making fun of everything. \n\nSo I get my certification and they repeatedly remind us that absolutely nobody without a certification is to even think about touching any of the equipment for set up. \n\nDay 1 of me having my certification I take my squad down to train. So I set everything up which takes about 30-45 minutes. It’s just a pain in the ass to do without help. And breaking it all down and putting it away is even worse. One of the computers had fallen asleep so I asked one of my junior soldiers on the other side of the room to tap the mouse to wake it up. And at that moment one of the training site supervisors had walked in the room and absolutely lost his mind. This guy was one rank above me and pulled me out of the room to chew me out about how I just got my certification and I’m already breaking the rules. I  told him that I didn’t think touching a mouse was such a vile offense and I apologized. But he was way too pissed. He told me to hand over my card and he ripped it in half in front of me and told me my certification was revoked. I was dumbfounded. I had lost my certification hours after I had earned it. MY leadership was going to be pissed. He told me to get out of his building so we both went back inside and I gathered up my squad while he continued to yell at me. He demanded that I cleaned up the room and reset all of the equipment before I leave. But I couldn’t. “Sorry Sarge, I’m not certified to handle that equipment.” And I turned around and left. I’ll never forget the look on his face. He was trying his hardest to say something but the sound of his stutters ended when the door shut behind me. I wish I could have seen how mad he was cleaning everything up by himself hahah. \n\nSo I had to go tell my leadership how I lost my cert but they thought the situation was hilarious and absolutely no repercussions came of it.

I often accompany her to the doctor because I know the medication that she takes and can help her understand complex instructions.  My aunt also tends to panic and call me with a million questions after we leave.  \n\nToday, we had a trip to the dentist.  She has experienced a lot of pain and asked me to go to help her explain and ask questions.  Unfortunately when they called her, I was in the restroom and when I asked to go back, they told me “We don’t allow that.”  I’ve been back with her for all but one visit and this is the first time I’ve heard of it.    When I tell them that, they tell me that they are going to check with the doctor.  He says they understand her just fine and she understands them.  Ooookay.  Welcome to my aunt’s speed dial.  We left 4 hours ago.  She had called 3 times and is still a little confused.  Looks like she needs to call for more information.  Oh well.\n\n",

I had helped open this specific location so I knew the ins and outs of just about everything. \n\nWithin a few months the general manager got promoted and we got a new on level we will call HB for horrible manager. This guy was terrible at managing. One thing he did was schedule the closers from 430 to 9. We closed at 9 but usually stayed until 930 or 10 to get cleaning done. \n\nin order to get a break and food we had to be scheduled for 5 hours on the schedule. Now just about every manager knew what was happening and would let us take our breaks and get food but not HB. he would point to the schedule and say you wernt scheduled for 5 hours. \n\nSo one night we came in to work and noticed HB was going to close with us. we knew that we wouldn't get a break so we all decided to leave exactly when we were scheduled. We didn't pre close like we usually do so the place had literally nothing done. \n\n9 PM rolls around and we all hang up our aprons and start to leave. \n\nHB \" where are you guys going? we still need to clean up\"\n\nMe \"sorry we are only scheduled until 9 and since we did not get a break we are going to get something to eat\"\n\nHB \"you guys know it takes a while to close up and 9 is a suggestion.\"\n\nMe \"well then you should make the schedule reflecting that.\"\n\nWe all walked out and the next day I was sat down and talked to. I made aware that its bs  that we all work for at least 5 hours when we close so we should get a break. if he wants to deny us breaks then we will leave at our scheduled time. \n\nAfter that he did not have problems with people taking breaks. \n\n",

I was biking through the small European city where I'm living, and some of the pedestrian streets in the center are under construction in order to upgrade the heating system for the upcoming winter. \n\nSo as a result, some of the normally wide streets are reduced really to narrow walking paths just wide enough for a few people. I was biking through one of the sections, so pedestrians going the opposite way can get by easily. I was biking at a walking pace, keeping my hand on the fence to keep my bike stable. \n\nUp ahead, some guy yells at me that to get off and walk my bike. Knowing that he wouldn't be able to pass me if I got off my bike, I happily obliged. \n\nI got off my bike and started walking the rest of the ~20m and he quickly realized he couldn't pass me. Due to the amount of people walking the same way of as I did, and the fact that I was no longer willing to contort to myself so he can get past, he had no choice but to turn around and walk the 20 meters back to the beginning of the construction zone so everybody can go through.\n\nHa! Enjoy having 30 seconds added on to your commute! &gt;:)",

She went to yell at the other manager, and they had to do those jobs for us while we were allowed to go home on time.",

        "text": "TL;DR: Senior staff in the lab tells me to keep a door closed at all times when I had left it open so she could save a little bit of her time. I close the door that she needs to exit through.\n\nEdit: The people saying that you shouldn't leave the door open are right. I didn't leave the door open to ruin other people's work, but so that she could get in without using the air shower. I'm aware that you should close the door if nobody is going to be using it immediately afterwards.\n\nEdit 2: The protocol, which so many have pointed out nicely I should follow (and I did), was to use the air shower once moving from the 10K area to the 100 area. This happened after we had already both gone through the air shower, so were free to move between the clean areas as we pleased (according to the protocol).\n\nEdit 3: I feel like I should also say that beyond this, I didn't have a negative interaction with this person, and, while I'm not familiar with her work, I've been told that she is actually extremely good at her job. She can just be pretty mean and rub people (i.e. me) the wrong way, thus this post.\n\nI hope this belongs here! So this summer I had an internship doing some wafer fabrication. Basically, you take a metal plate and make some really tiny devices on it. One of the hard parts is that because the device is so small (features on the order of a millionth of a meter) you have to be REAAAALLY careful with how clean the environment is, as a particle could just ruin your device that you spent months working on. To help with this problem, all the processes are run inside a clean room, with an air shower and gowns and filters and everything to minimize the particles in the air. There's the 10K area which is big, and clean, and the 100 area inside it (like a big rectangle, and then a small rectangle inside the big rectangle) which is REALLLLLY clean. To go from the 10K area to the 100 area for the first time, you needed to go through an air shower which took around 1 minute, and it's pretty annoying since it's kind of useless and takes time. After you had done it once, you didn't need to do the air shower again, though.\n\nAnyway, most everyone that works there is super helpful and nice, and more than happy to help out li'l ole me who was just some random intern that didn't know every single protocol of the clean room, which not many people followed to the letter anyway. There was *one* woman, let's call her Alice, who was notorious for being the lab police, and being really mean about it. There's even a story I heard about someone losing their job after doing a process Alice recommended because it didn't work (and the person who lost their job even told her it wouldn't), and Alice is married to the department head. That sort of person.\n\nThe lockers are located in the 10K area, and I needed to grab some stuff for something I was going to do, and so I left through the main exit next to the air shower, being careful not to close it as I didn't want to have to go through the air shower again and the exit locks. I see Alice in the 10K area grabbing some of her locker stuff too and as I reenter the 100 area through the exit, I leave the door a little ajar for her to get back in. As I walk back in the lab she follows me in and yells across the lab for me, in front of a fair number of people (the lab is pretty small).\n\nI walk back to her, as I didn't hear her the first few times she called for my attention and so was pretty far away and ask her what's wrong. She gets up in my face and says \"Don't you dare leave that door open. It has to stay closed.\" I was an intern and she was senior staff, so I wasn't about to argue. I just shrugged, apologized, and reached over to the door and yanked it closed so it locked, and then looked her in the eye. She glared at me for an extra second, then opened and left through the exact same door I had just closed. From then on, I always made sure to shut that door if she was in the 10K area, so she had to waste that extra minute in the air shower.",

I work as a consultant, and as anyone can tell you, consultant charge you a ton of money, to make up for the fact that we have a buttload of non-billable time and overhead. \n\nI was doing a two-hour safety startup for some minor excavation around some possible hazardous materials, pretty much a routine I can do while half asleep, and so can everyone there because they've all heard it a hundred times. But the law is the law, and we're doing it again. It's pretty my only job for that day, so I'm planning some nice \"sitting in the sun doing admin work\" to fill my afternoon. \n\nAfter the startup talk, I'm sitting with the site safety official, checking their paperwork, when Asshole Foreman (AF) walks in: \n\n&gt;AF: New girl, your turn to pick up lunch! Here's the list.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;Me: Uhhhh...say what?      \n&gt;  \n&gt;AF: We get a big lunch every wednesday, and since you're new, it's your turn to pick it up.     \n&gt;  \n&gt;Me: Yeah sorry, but I'm the consultant for the haz...      \n&gt;  \n&gt;AF: I don't give a shit. Just gimme the bill and I'll reimburse you. If you want any, you gotta buy it yourself.     \n&gt;  \n&gt;Me (thinking): One: I'm 30 and not a girl. Two: Fuck you, asswipe! Three: I don't think you realize what I cost per h...    \n&gt;  \n&gt;Me (out loud): Sure, but can you sign off first?    \n&gt;  \n&gt;AF: Yeah yeah.  \n\nHe signs the workorder for time and expenses, so I go out, smiling as I drive to the \"local\" deli about 50km away. I wait patiently, grinning as they make about 40 subs to order. Meanwhile, I've got all the time in the world to work on some bills and other admin work, in the sun, with a coffee. When the order's done, my smile wide enough to fill up the car, I drive back. \n\n&gt;Me: Lunch is here!   \n&gt;  \n&gt;AF: See, that wasn't so bad, right?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Me: Nope, turns out I actually remembered how to drive. Teehee. So here's your sub, and here's your copy the bill for the safety startup talk and the bill for the subs. And heeeere's your copy for the bill for my unplanned overtime and my travel expenses. I already CC'd your office with all of that and your work order, so don't worry about any cash. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat was last month. They actually paid the full bill without issue on monday.

        "text": "Long time lurker, first time poster. Im posting this on mobile so please take it easy on me if the formatting is off!\n\nSo, a bit of context first.\n\nI worked at a call centre for an insurance company. I was a sales and service consultant looking to move up within the company, so i was always looking to complete additional tasks to improve my chances on gaining the next promotion.\n\nAs some of you may know, call centres are usually quite toxic and inolve micro-managing employee’s until they hate themselves. This call centre was no different.\n\nOne of the biggest company focus’s at the time was our online ‘self service centre (SSC)’ - basically it was to assist customers in moving their transactions online so that we didn’t have 1000 calls a day asking for something small such as a change of registration number or updating the address their vehicle was parked at.\n\nConsultants were required to promote (read: force feed) the SSC to every customer on every call. In the office was roughly 13 team leaders, as well as a senior manager. Each team had roughly 10-15 people, so all together there was about 150-200 people on the floor. Each team leader had their own idea of how it should be promoted and forced that ideology down the throat of their consultants - the most common proccess was to promote it immediately at the start of the call. You can imagine this was a mess, as you call your insurance company for help and they tell you to jump online before they even discuss or acknowledge your call.. which is frankly extremely rude customer service.\n\nAdditionally, the consultants never received proper training for the SSC - so they were not 100% sure of what processes you could and could not complete online... so no matter what the customer called for, the consultant would tell them at the start of the call they could complete it online.\n\nNow, back to me completing additional tasks; i decided to take ownership of the SSC and to help educate my fellow consultants on how we could better promote the online service.\n\nI had lengthy conversations with consultants to determine why they were uncomfortable promoting the SSC, and (big surprise) there was two main reasons;  they felt it was rude to promote it at the start of the call, and they did not know what processes you could complete online.\n\nI organised a presentation with the team leaders and discussed my findings, and asked for their thoughts.\n\nI was greeted with a fair bit of tirade, which went along the lines of “we have taught our consultants the right way, you’re just a consultant yourself so we know better than you do, and until you prove otherwise, we wont listen to your suggestions at all!” \n\nI had a chat with the senior manager, and i told him that the reason we were experiencing low digital promotion numbers were because the team leaders did not understand the capabilties of the SSC, and were forcing cosultants to promote the service even if you were not sure if their request could be completed online. His exact words were “prove it, and i’ll take your side on this.”\n\nI waited until the next big presentation ( which included the senior manager, team leaders, and all of their consultants. I requested 10 minutes for a quick presentation on the SSC, and my senior manager agreed without asking what i was planning to do.\n\nCue the malicious compliance - i created a 20 question true/false quiz on the functionality and capability of the SSC, and handed one copy and a pen to each of the team leaders and asked them to fill it in quickly.\n\nThe look of horror on each of their faces as they recieved the quiz and realized they knew nothing about the SSC was amazing to see. Their consultants were all smiling ear to ear, as they could see the point i was trying to prove.\n\n10 minutes later, i read out the answers and got the team leaders to mark the sheet of the person seated next to them; it wasnt a suprise when they read out the name of the team leader and their score - none of them scored more than 10/20. The senior manager was seated in the corner of the room, with a little smile on his face as he watched this all unfold.\n\nHe had a chat to me afterwards and let me go through with the presentation i had planned for the SSC - digital promotion numbers increased from 13% to 85% within the space of a week.\n\nTL;DR; team leaders think they know everything about a program, i provide them with a quiz in front of all of their consultants and they fail miserably.\n\n",

        "text": "original by u/molotok_c_518\n\nLTL;FTP. It has taken a while, but I finally have a post for this sub.\n\nQuick background: I work as a support tech for a very large software firm. We provide phone and email support for their productivity suite (which I refer to in /r/talesfromtechsupport as $BSS). We support small business admins, which range is competence from \"I touch the keyboard, and it all falls in line for me\" to \"I clicked the thing, and it all crashed.\"\n\nCurrently, we are doing a test program: frequent callers, people who put in multiple tickets in a short period of time, get routed to a special queue. A handful of techs (myself included) take those tickets, and assist the admins.\n\nThe problem with being in this program? Frequent fliers (or $FFs) are nice enough, but they fall into the \"I did the thing, and now my computer is on fire\" category.\n\nAs an example, one $FF put in a ticket that his cloud-syncing software ($CS) was broken: it turned out he was using some esoteric file-naming system that included special characters, which were forbidden due to system requirements listed in the documentation. When the previous tech closed the ticket, $FF opened a new one with a related issue ($CS couldn't sync the files because the name was too long... turns out, his file system went about 10 folders deep, and each folder was adding about 15 characters to the file path, which made for some extrememly long file names).\n\nBasically, we all hate the program and can't wait for it to end.\n\nWhat sealed it for me was this guy: Asshole Frequent Flier ($AFF).\n\nI got a ticket, email contact only, that his tasks in one of the apps weren't syncing up to the cloud, and his second PC wasn't opening files in that app properly when downloaded from the cloud.\n\nEasy fix: fix the licensing on the second PC, resync everything using $CS, and everything is synced up properly.\n\nI write all of this up in my polite style, and send it to the admin.\n\nIn a perfect world, the admin tried what I did, thanked me profusely, the clouds opened up, and a rainbow-farting unicorn bestowed a bag of pure gold coins upon me.\n\nIn this world, he tried absolutely nothing, and shot back an email:\n\n    $AFF: Get me another agent. You don't know what the hell you're talking about.\n\nOkay. I've been here a year, and have helped hundreds of people with this issue. I'm one of three people on my team who know that particular app, and have experience with how it works.\n\nSo, with the blessings of my team lead, I sent $AFF a coldly-worded email, letting him know that to get a new tech, he would need to open a new ticket, and closed mine.\n\n\"That's compliance,\" you're thinking. \"Where's the malice?\"\n\nWell... he's a $FF. All $FF tickets are getting routed to my small group of techs.\n\nAn hour later, a coworker came up to me, and mentioned that he had a ticket from $AFF with the same issue. \"What should I tell him?\"\n\n\"Have him fix the sync with the cloud in $CS, and clear the license conflict on his second PC,\" I said.\n\nHe got back to me 5 minutes later: \"He says I don;t know what I'm talking about, and wants a new tech.\"\n\nSo, he too closed the ticket. An hour later...\n\nSecond coworker: \"Hey, I have a ticket from $AFF, and...\"\n\n\nMe: gives same fix\n\nIt took 5 tickets for this guy to finally do what we asked him to in the first ticket. Shockingly, it fixed the issue.\n\nTL;DR: Admin has issue, tells me I'm incompetent, takes 5 tries to the same team, giving him the same fix, to actually do the thing that fixes it.\n\nEDIT: I just realized that I forgot to close a parenthesis. Oops. This is what happens when you don't put your posts through a C++ compiler.\n\n\n\n**EDIT:  My malicious compliance - in response to u/misterr0bot commenting \"I'm sick of reading this. Can I have a new OP?\" I delivered a new post to read.**",

        "text": "A few years back, I was working in a horrifically toxic job, one of those managed providers that bought out the employment contract of a large organization so said org could shift some money from its payroll to operating expenses.\n\n(Let's forget that the regional gov outsourcing us unionized nerds was paying (our calculations) three times the opex for the drop in payroll, and that the new environment was so toxic that 6% of staff was on doc-mandated psyche leave and one wonderfully brilliant guy tried to kill himself in front of us.  Get yerself, checked, kids.)\n\nSo the lazy director 'fit'-interviews a new team lead, and he's such a laughable caricature of every German stereotype and such a bad match that we all veto the hire; but he comes in anyway.  Cue the hilarity.\n\nThe one bit I want to relay is this:  one morning this lead, the Supah, needs a meeting with me, and informs me that he's recorded me coming in late all week; a surprise as I'm usually in very early to get a jump on the hatestorm.  He's recorded me at 8:01, 8:07, etc, and this apparently vill. not. do.\n\nEasy-peasy.  Go to our boss, who confirms the start time is 0830, tells the lead that it's not his job anyway, that he should understand his tasks before instructing people he is not even tasked to direct, yet; that as of now he'll never direct me, because singling out staff is a problem that will live on in his file, please sign here ....\n\n... and for my last few months there, I'd wander in for the day, pointedly ask him the time (08:09? okay), and remind anyone asking for help (I had 20 years experience) that I needed to sit and wait for 0830, because the supah got 'confused' about my start time before when I didn't.  It was meditative.",

        "text": "This took place close to 14 years ago now, I had recently moved house and so i had just enrolled at a new school. Part of the enrollment at the new school was the requirement for an up to date contact sheet if they needed to contact my parents for any reason, this had to be handed in to the school nurse known as Matron.\n\nThere was a school trip coming up to Madame Tussauds wax works  in London and I didn't want to miss out. I had handed in my parents consent to go on the trip and was looking forward to it. A few days later I was called to the Matrons office as she had misplaced my contact sheet and needed another one or I wouldn't be able to go. So I handed this in the next day and everything was ready for a fun filled day out in London.\n\nThe day of the trip arrives and we all board our coach to London, we get in to London and we all notice that there is ALOT of sirens and emergency services rushing about. We stop outside of Madame Tussauds which is surrounded with a heavy police presence. You see, the day of our school trip was also the day of the 2005 London bombings. \n\nThe police hastily got us back on the bus and instructed us to leave London. When we got back to the school we all had to wait inside the library and take turns calling our parents to let them know that we were ok. This took a long time as some of the devices used in the bombings had been set off using mobile phone reception, so a lot of the network service providers had shut down the networks.\n\nMy turn finally comes around and I am taken to the Matrons office with my Form tutor and my head of year. It was at this point that Matron started to angrily lay in to me about the fact that she did not have a contact sheet for me. She was screaming at me saying how would she contact my family if there had been an emergency and that I should have given her one.\n\nThis is where the Malicious compliance comes in I told her that I knew my Dads number and that we could ring that. Now my Dad is the kind of man who does not suffer fools and finds a lot of school rules arbritary and draconian but he had also been on the education board at my previous school.\n\nMatron hands me the phone and I look her dead in the eye as i say to my Dad, \"the Matron here has just shouted at me and humiliated me because she has lost my emergency contact sheet twice, she would like to talk to you about it\"\n\nThe look on her face as I handed the phone over to her and listened to her get chewed out by my dad for her incompetence was priceless.",

        "text": "LTL;FTP. It has taken a while, but I finally have a post for this sub.\n\nQuick background: I work as a support tech for a very large software firm. We provide phone and email support for their productivity suite (which I refer to in /r/talesfromtechsupport as $BSS). We support small business admins, which range is competence from \"I touch the keyboard, and it all falls in line for me\" to \"I clicked the thing, and it all crashed.\"\n\nCurrently, we are doing a test program: frequent callers, people who put in multiple tickets in a short period of time, get routed to a special queue. A handful of techs (myself included) take those tickets, and assist the admins.\n\nThe problem with being in this program? Frequent fliers (or $FFs) are nice enough, but they fall into the \"I did the thing, and now my computer is on fire\" category.\n\nAs an example, one $FF put in a ticket that his cloud-syncing software ($CS) was broken: it turned out he was using some esoteric file-naming system that included special characters, which were forbidden due to system requirements listed in the documentation. When the previous tech closed the ticket, $FF opened a new one with a related issue ($CS couldn't sync the files because the name was too long... turns out, his file system went about 10 folders deep, and each folder was adding about 15 characters to the file path, which made for some extrememly long file names).\n\nBasically, we all hate the program and can't wait for it to end.\n\nWhat sealed it for me was this guy: Asshole Frequent Flier ($AFF).\n\nI got a ticket, email contact only, that his tasks in one of the apps weren't syncing up to the cloud, and his second PC wasn't opening files in that app properly when downloaded from the cloud.\n\nEasy fix: fix the licensing on the second PC, resync everything using $CS, and everything is synced up properly.\n\nI write all of this up in my polite style, and send it to the admin.\n\nIn a perfect world, the admin tried what I did, thanked me profusely, the clouds opened up, and a rainbow-farting unicorn bestowed a bag of pure gold coins upon me.\n\nIn this world, he tried absolutely nothing, and shot back an email:\n\n&gt;$AFF: Get me another agent. You don't know what the hell you're talking about.\n\nOkay. I've been here a year, and have helped hundreds of people with this issue. I'm one of three people on my team who know that particular app, and have experience with how it works.\n\nSo, with the blessings of my team lead, I sent $AFF a coldly-worded email, letting him know that to get a new tech, he would need to open a new ticket, and closed mine.\n\n\"That's compliance,\" you're thinking. \"Where's the malice?\"\n\nWell... he's a $FF. All $FF tickets are getting routed to my small group of techs.\n\nAn hour later, a coworker came up to me, and mentioned that he had a ticket from $AFF with the same issue. \"What should I tell him?\"\n\n\"Have him fix the sync with the cloud in $CS, and clear the license conflict on his second PC,\" I said.\n\nHe got back to me 5 minutes later: \"He says I don't know what I'm talking about, and wants a new tech.\"\n\nSo, he too closed the ticket. An hour later...\n\nSecond coworker: \"Hey, I have a ticket from $AFF, and...\"\n\nMe: *gives same fix*\n\nIt took 5 tickets for this guy to finally do what we asked him to in the first ticket. Shockingly, it fixed the issue.\n\nTL;DR: Admin has issue, tells me I'm incompetent, takes 5 tries to the same team, giving him the same fix, to actually do the thing that fixes it.\n\nEDIT: I just realized that I forgot to close a parenthesis. Oops. This is what happens when you don't put your posts through a C++ compiler. EDIT 2: ...and a ; in place of a '. Oops. Thank you, /u/thebodymullet and /u/nowitholds for pointing them out.",

        "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nAs my previous post i do my IT internship at my school. So it started wtih a man with a laptop, his laptop screen was broken so ofcourse we had to fix it. He handed the laptop over and we gave a ''borrow laptop'' they can just borrow them till the laptop is fixed so they can alteast do some work. The next week one of our experts fixed the laptop screen so it was all working fine again. We called the man saying that it was fixed but he said: I dont want that laptop anymore i want a bigger one cause of my big fingers. We explained that a bigger laptop does not mean a bigger keyboard. He still said that he would not pick up his old laptop cause he wanted a bigger one. Another week goes by finally he came to get the laptop but also to talk to our supervisor. He got pretty mad at her saying that his friend got a bigger laptop (because the programms and tasks he needs to do are more suited for a bigger and higher performance type laptop) so i should get one to. After that he left again without his old laptop. We called him again a time later now he came up with a totally different excuse. He claimed that his eye sight was suffering from not having a big enough laptop. The whole IT department was kinda done with him so we sill have his old laptop and now he just has to use a very very old ''borrow laptop'' with windows 7. Is this considered payback or just karma?\n\nps: sorry for bad grammer\nHope it does fit here like suggested",

        "text": "Cross-post from ProRevenge. Someone suggested that you all might enjoy this. \n\nI worked for an insurance company as a total loss adjuster. This was back in January.\n\nWhen a car is totaled, it simply means that it's uneconomical to repair or the state guidelines won't allow for it to be repaired. 90% of the time, people don't want to hassle with jumping through the hoops of getting a salvaged title, handling the car, repairs, blah blah blah, so the insurance company--although not required to--will typically handle the wrecked car for you and move it to the yard and auction it. \n\nWell an inbound call comes in and it's Captain Asshat of the Douchelords (CADL). He immediately starts berating me and is upset that his claim hasn't been paid yet. He had a nice 2014 Benz that was totaled from a collision accident (worth about $30k before the accident) and it was sitting in our salvage yard awaiting the proper paperwork from Captain Asshat. \n\nMe: I apologize for the delays, but it seems that we haven't received your paperwork that was sent to you on [three weeks ago]. Did you receive the packet?\n\nCADL: I received it, but I'm busy! I can't take time to get the documents signed and notarized!! This is ridiculous, why can't you just pay my claim?!\n\nMe: Because the vehicle's final resting place will be in *NY, we *must* have these documents to be able to properly salvage your vehicle and pay your claim. Plus, we also have to remain in compliance with your state's Department of Insurance (DOI). \n\nCADL: It's been three weeks! \n\nMe: ...again, we need those documents back, signed and notarized to be able to release payment first. We overnighted them to you, and even included a free overnight return label for your convenience.\n\nCADL: You're my insurance company, you have to do it! I won't be bothered to find a notary and ship these docs back to you! I'm a [hotshot job title] I have more important things to do than you, someone who works in a call center! \n\nMe: Sir, we can't sign your name on your behalf, that's called forgery and it's illegal. Look, if it's too much trouble, I can help you find a notary nearby with flexible hours and I'll even call the shipping carrier to help you arrange for the documents to be picked up from your house. But NY does not allow us to circumvent this process. \n\nCADL: No! I already said, this is your problem, you deal with it! \n\nMe: But I can't handle your wrecked vehicle properly and pay you without these docs! \n\nCADL: Well, you'll have to find another fucking way to do it! \n*Hangs up*\n\nCADL was represented by an attorney for injuries, so I thought I'd call them to see if they could help. I speak with the receptionist, who was apologetic for CADL's behavior and said he's been a nightmare to work with. He talks down to the staff, is uncooperative, and she apologized numerous times that I even had to talk to him. I explained the situation, and said that I was hoping that even though they're not repping him for property damage, that maybe the attorney could talk some sense into CADL. \n\n\"We'll try, but we're not even eager to help him with his injury case because he's such a jerk.\"\n\nAttorney was unsuccessful in getting CADL's cooperation, so I had no choice but to return his damaged, inoperable property back to him. \n\nI schedule a tow truck to move the wrecked car back to CADL's address on file.\n\nI check back on the call log the next day and sure enough, CADL's wrecked car had been moved back to his home parked in the common driveway, immobile and without keys. 😂 Blocking his roommate's vehicles in, might I add. \n\nCADL has called in a total of 7 times to complain, escalate, and get the vehicle moved. One inexperienced rep tried to move it but I was monitoring the file and cancelled her tow. CADL called in several more times and each adjuster's notes referred to my documented account of how uncooperative he was and refused to take the vehicle back until we got his docs. CADL stated that the address on file wasn't actually his, it's his landlord's house where he rents a room and he *needs* the car moved! His landlord wasn't happy and was threatening him with legal action! Another adjuster told him that we will no longer use our resources (towing, salvage yard, etc.) to help him with HIS wrecked vehicle and that HE caused this mess by simply not sending the required docs back. If he needed the vehicle moved that desparately, he would have to pay to tow it and store it at his own expense. \n\nAs I mentioned earlier, insurance companies are not required to handle the vehicle in most states. It was CADL's property and in order to indemnify him we did still owe him a good chunk of his $30k. Since he opted to essentially \"keep\" the vehicle by way of not cooperating, we must also deduct the salvage value of his wrecked car (this represents the amount we anticipated to receive for the wrecked car at auction). That was a whopping $8k of his $30k settlement! So not only did he have a wrecked car sitting in his driveway, now we've also reduced his settlement by $8k. \n\nNot more than a week later, we got his documents back, but it took another week after that to get his vehicle picked back up. Since we were now in possession of the vehicle, we also did pay him his full settlement in the end but he ate the costs of moving the vehicle around unnecessarily. \n\nCar accidents suck, I get it. We were trained not to take things personally, and I often get the brunt of peoples' frustration all day, every day. I am empathetic and try to be as helpful and accommodating as possible because I'm human. A total loss can definitely turn things upsidedown. 99% of the time, I can de-escalate someone and it doesn't turn out this way but there's always that one person who has to act like a jackass.\n\nEDIT: TL;DR courtesy of u/RabidSeason:\n\n\nCUSTOMER: \"I've ignored this for 3 weeks! Why haven't you taken care of my problem yet?\"\n\nINSURANCE: \"Damaged property returned. Your problem is now your problem.\"",

        "text": "English is not my mother tongue, sorry in advance!!!\n\nThis happend 3 years ago when i was on my residency program. I will give some context since most people arent in contact with medical world and Mexico medical system is a special kind of beast.\n\nThe hospital i was in is very small, often we had shifts and even days with out attendings, this is usual in Mexico, the resident then does his best to care for the patient, this sucks for the patient and for the resident, since the patient isnt getting optimal care and the resident doesnt get the supervision and teaching, but since this happends from day one, we as residents read and teach ourself/each other and become self sufficient. Also, most of the old doctors arent up to date with medicine, so they cant really offer of when talking about critical patients.\n\nNow to the story, I was on my second year of residency, we had a old attending who is a internal medicine and nephrology specialist, he is always an ass to the nurses, to the students, to the residents, even to the families of the ill, he clocks in at 2100 does the round and at 0000 he goes home to rest every time.\n\nOne day while on his shift he goes home and around 0300 a patients goes into code, we give CPR, he comes out but goes in again like 1 hour later and dies, we talk to the family, do every single paper needed and leave only the death certificate for him to sign in the morning, when he comes back at 0700 to clock out, i ask him for the signature, he goes Ham on me, yelling his lungs out about how i didnt let him know a patient was severly ill, so he says i must write down a report of what happend and delivered it to the hospital director in case a legal action is taken, i try to tell him the family is grateful, everything is in other and that is not needed, he tells me that if i dont do it, he will report me to the university for insubordination.\n\nI tell him i will get it done in one hour and hand it in, he yells at me some more and goes home.\n\nSo i do the report where i stated that he wasnt in the hospital grounds during the event and thats why we prescribed the medications and gave the CPR with out supervision.\n\nNext day i get called to the internal medicine department chief office where he ask me why did i exposed said attending, to which i answer that he asked me to do it and even threatening me if i didnt, his face goes red and says he got suspended while an investigation goes on as to why he wasnt on the hospital and then laughs at how stupid the attending must be to ask for me to report that, he ask me to come to him first if anything like that happends again.\n\nFair to say the attending came back to work one month later, gave us his phone number and asked to be called if anything happend but that is another story.\n\nEDIT: fixed the hours and some terrible spelling.\n\nALSO: We as residents and medical students complain every time about how we are left unsupervised, but get nothing, Doctors in Mexico tend to leave the public hospital on their shifts and go to the private practice because the private is much better paid, this is something that is wrong on so many ways but since it has worked like that since the dawn of time, no one does anything about it and if you try you get the cane.",

        "text": "This story was from a month or so ago, but I only just realized it'd fit well here.\n\nSo, where I'm from, a \"HOA\" isn't really a thing... For the \"fortunate\" ones among us however, who live in an apartment building, get something similar. A council of sorts who vote on what we can all split the budget on for maintenance, and that makes the decisions about what can/ cannot be done on the outside of the building. \n\nNaturally, what should be an objective and reasonable discussion is known to turn rather petty. Everyone wants to fix THEIR thing first, after all, and to hell with the rest- There's been more than one instance of \"You want to place an AC unit outside..? Well, first we'll have to do X\"- Naturally, the person making that demand would later place their own AC outside, after it's been approved by everyone.\n\nSo, I'm not going to point any fingers to who's \"guilty\" here... I'm just to recount the story. So, my mother, like everyone else in the meeting, had gathered a whole list of \"bullet points\" of things that needed to be done... In the hopes of getting only a couple done, really- There were points she didn't \"really\" care that much about, but if they were another thing she was willing to \"forget\" about in order to have something done she did want, then that was all that mattered. One of those things was our outside tap. Now, we're not the only ones with an outside tap, but we are the only ones with a small path to the front of the building- Remember that, it's important. However, something with these taps (they're separate from the inside taps) is broken- We believe it may be a filter or something, or maybe the pipes are just bust, but one thing is clear... The water REEKS. It's like someone has pulled stagnant water out of the swamp, right next to an exhaust pipe above a mcdonalds. Supposedly it's fine, but it doesn't SMELL like it's fine. So of course, when we need water outside, we usually just use the tap water inside... Now for the malicious compliance.\n\nSo, the meeting starts, and everyone of course starts listing off their own respective issues... And she ends up in an argument with another resident over a couple issues. Eventually the resident comes up with the fact that with the heatwave, the little garden in front of our residence is completely wilted- And that with us being the only one with \"easy driveway access\", it should be OUR responsibility to keep them watered.\n\nOf course, my mom was a little bit peeved, since none of her demands were being listened to, and now they had the audacity to make demands of her- However, the gears of malicious compliance were already ticking... She asked that if she did it, if something else could be arranged. Apparently not thinking anything of the sudden friendly smile, an agreement was made, and the meeting concluded as all meetings do, still disgruntled and no one happy.\n\nExcept her, of course. The next day with a smile, she pulls out the garden hose, and plugs it in the outside tap... Strides all the way up to the front of the building, and then, let loose.\n\nFrom a distance everything probably seemed fine. If you got closer though, you'd believe that the building might actually be retrofitted to serve as the local toxic waste recycling area, as the hose was directly linked to Satan's garden faucet. The water forming a thick, smelly barrier that I heard later on drafted upwards... Straight to the other resident's building just as well. This only seemed helped by the summer heat, causing it all to evaporate rather than sink away in the soil, lasting almost all day... Which turned into a 24/7 haze as she wanted to make sure the flowers would survive the heat, of course!\n\nThe next meeting she was politely requested to stop watering the flowers... And now they're considering finally fixing those taps!",

        "text": "So this isn't so much MC as it is loophole abuse, but whatever.\n\nMy brother is a new homeowner, having recently dropped $50k on a house, and he has a problem. His stairs are just, fucking, horrible. Like, \"the only thing holding them together is the rot\" horrible.\n\nHardly the worst thing he came across renovating this place, but see, there's a complication: they're not up to code. And THAT means that he can't just tear them out and rebuild from scratch, because if he does that the new stairs will have to be up to code, and there simply isn't enough room for that.\n\nSo basically the situation is that he can't build new stairs and he ~~can't~~ really shouldn't use the old ones, so what does he do?\n\nHe braces the stairs with what is essentially a second staircase built into the underside of the first. To make sure you're accurately picturing this thing: imagine a flight of stairs wearing another flight of stairs like a glove. (Hm; I'ma make that the title.) Technically the old stairs are still in place and have been left unmolested, but structurally speaking they're essentially covers for the structure that's really bearing the weight of people going up and down them.",

        "text": "This happened some time ago and with a certain unnamed ride sharing platform which I will call Uber for simplicity.\n\nI work at a warehouse where we get out of town inspectors from time to time whom were arranged by our customers.\n\nEvery time they come, we hire a pick up service to pick them up at the airport or train station. This was before Uber became popular.\n\nAfter when Uber became popular and more convenient we resorted to hiring Uber’s to pick them up. We paid for the ride of course out of courtesy (by using our own Uber app to make the call), but there was no rule on who should pay. But I bet their company reimbursed them on any traveling expenses anyway.\n\nThis inspector had a peculiar habit of scheduling their arrival time to our place to be right before lunch, so that we would have to take them out to lunch and we would pay for it too out of courtesy and they would order semi-expensive stuff.\n\nFor this customer it was our last order with them and we had no intention of continuing on further due to business reasons.\n\nWhen the inspector asked us to call an Uber to take them back to the airport, this time for some reason they wanted an “Uber Black”. In case you don’t know, that means a luxury car comes to pick you up which is quite expensive.\n\nBut unknown to the inspector, the Uber app allows you to specify that the ride would be paid by another person rather than the app owner.\n\nSo when the inspector arrives at the airport they’re going to be in for a surprise when they will have to pay out of their pocket for the Uber Black rather than a regular Uber.\n\nI never heard from them afterwards and don’t know how they handled it.

        "text": "So I work in a gift shop. We are big enough to have a floor in the on property warehouse and 2 warehouse guys. Well today after about a month since my last morning shift I was tasked with making a restock list for the snacks. This list has a few sections and most are order by the case of product. Two are by the individual. I didn't realize the bakery stuff was by the individual. So I order one of each as we had none in back stock. So this guy gets my list with a bunch of stuff. He knows we never order only one of an item we want a box. But in what was an attempt to teach us a lesson, he literally brought exactly 1 of each. He would of had to open a new box take one out, put it in the tote and bring it up. So I had to redo the list to order enough. Yeah it was my bad not double checking.",
