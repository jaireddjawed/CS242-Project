        "text": "When god saves us from something, we don't know what we are saved from. If we suddenly get a feeling that something is wrong or that we need to stay away from something or someone or get a feeling to make a change and we do it we don't know what would have happened if we didn't do it. But if we ask why and think it could be ok afterall and ignore how we feel because what we face or do looks good (the fruit was pleasant to the eye) or has an instant benifit to us (the fruit was good to eat), then we eventually figure out just why we should have not stayed in that situation that turned out bad, now we know good and bad, and not only good the way god intended. And are 'casted out' of heaven. The bad we knew leaves a mark on our soul, we lose our innocence, we start having enough of life. Eventually we die thinking \"if only I did this\", \"if only I didn't do that\", with memories of other wonderful people and memories that died or turned sour.  And that my friends is what you call \"hell\". But we try and do our best to comfort and help eachother and sometimes we managr to save another wonderful moment, another soul from breaking just now. And that my friends is heaven :)",

If God is one in essence and one in will, then how exactly do persons differ from one another?",

During the date, I noticed he had a Catholic sticker on his laptop and was wearing a cross necklace that was hidden under his shirt. I am not religious myself, and I don't really have interest in dating someone that is devoutly catholic. Just as I personally have found that the people in my area that are very religious do not have the same views on things as I do. I also saw on his Instagram he is friends with some people I went to high school with that are incredibly conservative, and in my experience are very intolerant people that treated me and my friends poorly. But I also know that of course not everyone is like this!  Because of this, I think it's important that I find out a bit more about where he stands just for my own peace of mind.\n\nHow do I politely ask about his faith? I enjoy talking to this person, however, I do not want to lead them on or waste their time. We are supposed to go ice skating on Saturday, but I think I need to get this figured out before we go on a whole other date\n\nMy thoughts were that I would just text something along the lines. Of\" \"hey I wanted to ask about the sticker I saw on your laptop, are you very religious?\" I don't want to be rude, but I also don't know how to kindly and politely communicate my opinions and see if we agree on things.\n\nI would appreciate any advice or thoughts, I don't want to seem rude at all!",

        "text": "I was born Muslim, then turned atheist, then found God again, but I'm not part of any religion.\n\nBut I realized that being a theist is probably impossible without joining any religion, because you NEED to have an idea of the nature of God. I don't believe in the 12 Greek gods, I don't believe in the Tao, or the sun, or whatever else. I believe in a monotheistic God. So I feel like joining a monotheistic religion might be necessary to complete my faith. If I joined one, I think I'd definitely join Christianity. But I'm really not sure about this, I like my individuality and I'm always wary about joining any group. \n\nThis post would get too long if I fully explain my perspective, so feel free to ask any questions in the comments. I can just say honestly that:\n\n- I believe with full conviction that God exists.\n\n- not only that, but I also think that believing in God of any sort is necessary for a healthy individual and society (at least myself). \n\n- I chose to believe that God is monotheistic. Well, I didn't really choose, when I regained faith as a result of a spiritual experience I naturally got the idea of Him being a monotheistic one. That might be because that's what I believed in when I was Muslim.\n\nHowever, my question is: did anyone else have the same experience? How did you deal with it? Do you have an advice for me?",

        "text": "Hey everyone! Before I continue, I apologize if anything in here is offensive: I do not intend for it to be.\n\nFor context, my wife volunteers at our local prison library, and frequently receives requests for Norse Pagan literature. She's told me that when those requests are received, there tends to be a discussion of which books to send: the reason for this is that there's been a major co-opting in recent years of Norse imagery by white supremacists and Antisemites, so she tries to send books that have the context in them to refute those ideas while providing a more accurate portrayal of Norse beliefs.\n\nI think I have a fair understanding of the reasons why a (surface level) understanding of Norse beliefs and imagery might appeal to this crowd: the stereotype plays to very traditionalist images of European masculinity, it's easy (though inaccurate) for Nordic White supremacists to frame Christianity as something that was forced upon them by \"the Jews,\" and a lot of the imagery has been co-opted by the power group. And of course, if you know about people like Varg, you know this has been going on for a while and has just gotten a bit more mainstream.\n\nI know that this is not reflective of either Norse Paganism as a whole or Norse reconstructionism: while there have been religious movements framing themselves around these ideas, my reading of Norse work has demonstrated a surprising variation in beliefs, including a far more open and fluid portrayal of gender than I expected. I also know that no religion should be defined by its worst actors: as a Jew, I hear about extremists in Israel, including the incoming government, distorting my religion in disturbing ways every day, and Muslims, Christians, Buddhists, and Hindus all deal with similar things around the world. \n\nThat being said, I'm curious about how antiracist Norse communities are handling this, so I wanted to ask the following questions:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. When your communities run into prospective new members, how do you determine if they have racist motivations? If they do, do you try to address and correct them, or kindly ask that they go somewhere else?\n2. Have you ever known someone within your religious community that you've found to have these views? How did you figure it out, and how did you address it?\n3. Sadly, as a Jewish person, this does make me worry about my safety when I meet Norse pagans. Are there \"tells\" that non-Norse people should be aware of that separate this element out from more regular Norse communities?\n4. What specific misconceptions about Norse beliefs do you think should be addressed publicly to correct this perception, both in incoming \"believers\" and in the general public?\n5. Specifically for Americans: how common is this belief system among Norse believers, in your experience?\n\nAgain, I apologize for any offense. Thank you for your time!",

I always felt that my life will suddenly become something else, something different, unique. I had no idea what it would be. I had many desires and many dreams. I thought that maybe if I pursued my aspirations, I would become happy, and fulfilled. Maybe that was that thing? I didn‚Äôt know. When I was a kid, I was convinced that an iPhone would make me happy, a new computer or a gaming console. Or maybe a big house where I could invite my friends and play with them all day. (My dad didn‚Äôt like me bringing friends to our home.) Maybe that was that thing? Or maybe I was supposed to go to space, become an astronaut and explore the unknown corners of the universe? I didn‚Äôt know.\n\nAs I got older my dreams started to be affected by others. The dreams of my parents and friends also became significant to me. My father wanted me to pursue the dreams that he couldn‚Äôt achieve when he was young. Becoming a professional athlete, a successful businessman, or a lawyer. Maybe that was that thing? Maybe my dad already had figured it out, just didn‚Äôt have the time and motivation to do it himself. Maybe that was my destiny. My friends at school were always talking about the new toys that just came out, later the toys were replaced by video games. I always felt left out because my parents could not afford new toys, a phone, or a computer. I thought that maybe if I could just have those things that everyone talks about that would make me happy. I felt jealous, it seemed that all the other kids had everything going for them.\n\nWhen I finished primary school, I thought happiness is there in the future. I would look up to the older kids in school. It seemed that their life is so cool. They looked so free and irresponsible. Maybe it was that? Isn‚Äôt it cool to be an adult and do whatever you want? Nobody can tell you what to do anymore. You are free! I would daydream about how happy I will be when I grow up. I thought, ‚ÄúMaybe that was that thing?‚Äù\n\nI grew up reading books and watching the ‚ÄúHarry Potter‚Äù movies hundreds of times. My life seemed so ordinary compared to Harry‚Äôs. I didn‚Äôt have magic powers or cool friends; I was a confused sensitive kid. My world wasn‚Äôt as magical or beautiful as Hogwarts or the Shire from LOTR. I didn‚Äôt have a grand mission to save the world. After all, I was just a small kid from a small town in the middle of nowhere. I think that‚Äôs why I got into reading. I was always na√Øve, ready to fight the windmills like Don Quixote. I loved reading Karl May‚Äôs books about the exciting life in the Wild West. After reading ‚ÄúWinnetou‚Äù and ‚ÄúBlack Mustang‚Äù I would be so inspired and would run outside and try to make my bow and arrows. The stories in the books of Alexander Dumas such as ‚ÄúThe Three Musketeers‚Äù, ‚ÄúThe Man in The Iron Mask‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Black Tulip‚Äù were so intriguing and thrilling. I couldn‚Äôt find that thing in my life, therefore I started looking for it in books and movies. I thought that maybe I am going to find that thing there. Something was there, but it was more of an escape from my reality.\n\nI would be so bored when I was a kid. After coming back from school, I would usually play with my toys and imaginary friends. I lived away from all my classmates. I would get very bored and lonely at home. My imaginary friend didn‚Äôt even have a name. I would call him ‚Äòhe‚Äô. I would play board games with him and my miniature green soldiers. I wanted to play with my dad or mom, but they were always either working or too busy, or too tired to play with me. My sister was older than me, and my attempts to play with her would be fruitless. I was longing for a relationship, friendship, and love. My parents would always fight, they were always so angry. I wanted them to love each other and have peace in our family, but no matter how hard I tried the result would always be the same. I could only pray for them at night‚Ä¶.\n\nWe lived in the same house as my dad‚Äôs parents. Therefore, I would spend a lot of time with my grandma. I would call her Baba. I and Baba would talk about books, and movies, go on long walks and spend a lot of time outside by the river that flowed near our house. We would dance sing and play. Baba taught me so much. . She showed me the beauty of nature. She would explain to me how every leaf and every blade of grass was a creation of God. She was a very sincere Christian and a follower of Sai Baba (a guru from India with curly black hair). She was very philosophical, intelligent, and artistic. Yet, she was very soft-hearted, she would daily feed homeless animals and be kind to all living beings. I never saw her get angry, she was always happy and shining. Therefore, I was closer to her than to my parents. She would cook for me more often and with more love than my mom. She would write beautiful poems and stories read books with me and talk so sweetly about nature and God. She was my best friend.\n\nShe planted something inside my heart. I still remember how she would describe God and his creation to me. Her explanations were so magical and intriguing. I was a Christian, yet the Christians in my life never really inspired me to be serious about my path. I saw so many teachers and preachers of the Bible, yet it seemed that they have never read it. They never followed what they preached, they were duplicitous, but luckily, I had my grandma, who actually lived by the teachings of the Bible. She was a true Christian, she had so much love for Christ and revealed a new dimension to my life. Love, nature, and God. She saw the beauty in others, in everything and everyone. God is everywhere, God is Love. That seed, that world that mystical realm that she revealed to me was so attractive. Her teachings were so simple, yet so deep and meaningful. She would always sacrifice for others, even at the cost of her suffering. She saw the hand of God everywhere. She was His friend\n\nAs I got older, I was contemplating more and more about the realm that my grandma revealed to me. Maybe that was that thing? Maybe that‚Äôs what I was longing for. I started to study different religions and different paths. (I talked about that in my last post) Felt in love with the books of Dostoyevsky and Herman Hesse. I became a seeker and a mystic. Now, I felt that I was closer to that thing than ever. But I could not grasp it, I could not see it, book knowledge couldn‚Äôt do it. I was only scratching the surface of what that thing was. I would pray at night to God to reveal my path. To guide me and show me the way. I would have beautiful dreams of Jesus, he was listening to me, and he was my friend. Yet, I knew that I am not going to be a Christian. Even though, at some point in my life, I wanted to become a Christian priest. Soon, my prayers were answered‚Ä¶\n\nJust after I turned 18, I met the most magnanimous and sweetest person in my life. His name was Vasanta (in Sanskrit means ‚Äòspring‚Äô). Vasanta was a life coach, an astrologer, and a teacher of bhakti-yoga. He mostly maintained His life and family through his astrology readings and life coaching. He had a religious community that he and his wife were taking care of. He was helping and guiding so many people. That is when I met Vasanta for the first time, but I never really got to talk to him. Therefore, I scheduled an astrology reading through his wife in his office.\n\nWhen I went to his astrology consultation, he talked with me, served me, made me tea, gave me snacks, and even charged my phone for me. I had only met him once before, in the bhakti-yoga temple in the city. Yet, he was so loving to me, he talked so sweetly and gently. He was genuinely interested in me. He would very carefully listen to me and ask me questions. The whole two hours I was there he was so joyful and peaceful. We talked about my life, but it seemed that he already knew everything about me. I have never experienced anything like that before. When he looked at me, I felt that he could see through me, that he could see everything. I cannot describe that feeling, I cannot explain what a relief I felt in my heart just by talking to him. I felt that he was my best friend, although I barely even knew him. The two hours I was there went so fast that I didn‚Äôt even realize it was time for me to go. I told him that I had to go, stood up, and grabbed my coat. I pulled out my wallet and asked him, ‚ÄúHow much do I owe you?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúNothing, I cannot take money from you.‚Äù\n\nI heard his words and became frozen. I could not believe it. I just had the most meaningful two hours of my life. The most valuable time of my life. And here he was, looking at me with a big smile on his face. I have never felt like that before. I felt that he was the first person in my life that saw the beauty in me. They accepted and loved me for who I was. He saw my eagerness and sincerity to find God. It was the first time in my life that experienced unconditional love. He didn‚Äôt want anything but to help me, he didn‚Äôt want my money or anything from me. He was only there to love me and help me. He walked up to me and gave me a big hug. I will never forget that moment‚Ä¶ I was still shocked at what just happened. I mechanically walked out of Vasanta‚Äôs small office, said goodbye, and heard the door close behind me. Now, I was on the street, and I could not operate anymore. Tears were flowing from my heart through my eyes and down my cheeks. Tears of love and tears of joy. I had never been so happy and so grateful to be alive.\n\nAll the knowledge and philosophical truths that I had collected up to that point were now worth nothing. Speaking about something and experiencing something are two completely different things. Now I was speechless. The seed in my heart started to sprout. I had traveled for so long, looked for that thing in so many places, so many books. But now I had arrived. Now, I saw my whole life flash in front of me and realized that everything lead me to this point. I have met my new best friend. I felt an explosion in my heart and shockwaves of love overwhelmed my body. This was the magic; this was that thing. This was the happiness that I was looking for. Now, I felt the hand of God closer to me than ever, I wasn‚Äôt alone anymore. I wasn‚Äôt a muggle anymore. My lifetimes of prayers and tears were finally answered. The love bomb demolished any doubts that I had and now I felt the presence of God. My Friend was finally with me. This is the power of meeting a saintly personality. But this was only the beginning.\n\nI started learning more about bhakti-yoga. Started going to the bhakti-yoga temple. There I tasted the most delicious food in the world, heard the most beautiful songs, and participated in the most ecstatic kirtan and dance for God. Even though I was still going to school and lived in another city, every day, when there was a program in the temple, I would travel for hours back and forward to get there. I had found that thing. Therefore, nothing could stop me anymore. I had found the path that I was looking for, the path of love.\n\nI had spent so much time and energy reading, contemplating, writing, looking, seeking, and trying to understand what that thing was. I was so philosophical and greedy for knowledge that my heart had become dry, but by the mercy of the Lord, I realized that I was only looking for Him. God is what I always looked for! But how was I so blind? He was always right there. He is my invisible friend:) Not because He doesn‚Äôt have a form, but because I am blind. He is my real friend; He is my real father and mother. He was the one who sent me my teachers and friends, like Vasanta, Baba, and many others that I haven‚Äôt mentioned yet.\n\nSpring, in the late cold Lithuanian autumn, spring had begun in my life. Now, my life has completely changed. I am a full-time celibate monk in NY, serving all day and night in the temple here. I have never been happier in my life, even the most difficult of challenges are blissful when you love God. I am still very far away from Him, but I know that He is the most merciful and the most graceful. He is full of love and compassion, especially for those like me, who have nothing to give him. I am full of faults and bad qualities; I am a sinner and an enjoyer. I am only taking from Him. My dear Invisible Friend, where are you? I cannot see you and this pain is burning my heart. Please do not forget me, I am only praying that you may accept me at your lotus feet.\n\nYour useless servant, Tirtha\n\nP.S if you have any questions or want to reach out to me DM me. I may not respond to the comments.",

        "text": "Did you know venomous snakes tend to not attack when they don't consider you a fear. But when a snake sees you fear the snake it considers you a danger because a fearful being is also ready to fight to survive. It takes a snake a lot of energy to create venom. So it would be waste to use it on something that it doesn't consider a threat. That's why cobra's for example intimidate someone by going upright, just to show i will attack if you pose a threat to me. But if a snake sees you show no fear when it does that, it won't consider you in a fighting state, nor in state where you might be a danger to the snake. I'm not saying go look for a snake and trying it out. But when you realise that fear vs fear equals danger, whereas seeing there is no danger in anything due to self-control and realisation that is just a state of survival and our primal instinct or as some would say \"original sin\"/\"inherited sin\".\n\nI believe the evolution theory and bible actually work together. And i believe the fear of snakes that our primal ancestors had, has a lot with us to do with eve eating the \"forbidden fruit\" as they call it. Because we don't speak snake do we?\n\nJohn 3:14-15 (NIV) says, ‚ÄúJust as Moses lifted up the snake in the wilderness, so the Son of Man must be lifted up, that everyone who believes may have eternal life in him.‚Äù\n\nIt is said that our primate ancestors left the jungle and ate psilocybin (magic) mushrooms and that this was the reason our prefrontal cortex grew so fast. Wouldn't it make sense that considering the snake was bad and running away from it after god said every living being was created good, was the reason god cursed them. Because god considered everything good and they didn't believe in him and let their fears take over, which means they were listening to the devil? Or perhaps even the snake within themselves?\n\nJust giving food for thought her, i know what i'm saying is controversial, but Moses compared Jesus to a snake, which in itself is controversial. Maybe it means that to judge test a mans believe in god, man must say the goodness in everything that god created?\n\nHence, someones must face their fears in order to see there was nothing to fear at all if you believe in God and all the goodness he put in all his creations? Though, being afraid of a living being the living being might consider you a threat to inviting them to sin?  \n\n\nSee in my eyes the evolution theory in this sense fits very well in the narrative of the bible too. If we once came from reptiles, we must share some fundamental primal survival instinct with them. When you turn around the word Live, it is Evil, So to not let something else live would make you evil. That explains to me the free will that god gave us. Once you limit someone they are not able to live, because they are limited by the fears and insecurities that we confine ourselves within. We tell each other not to do this and not to do that, but isn't all of it a consequences or better said cause &amp; effect of the original sin.   \n\n\nSee, the effects of psilocybin mushrooms can be pretty intense for someone who is not prepared for what it can bring. Some speak of meeting god on very high doses. In a way it is a very spiritual experience, but for the experience that adam &amp; eve might've had at the age of their consumption of it, they might've experienced shame and fear that was not meant to be experienced by someone of that age. It would be paradoxical of God to limit them from eating it, but also offering the same free will. Or maybe our ancestors were much more in tune with their natural instinct and could actually communicate through other ways and the development that was made through eating those mushrooms was actually of negative benefit as everything was already perfect the way it was. It is for example also said that mushrooms initially were capable of covering miles of terrain and then transmuting into water, possible creating oceans. There is a lot of debate on how these psychedelic experiences have made people meet god and i have experienced something very similar on multiple occasions as well. I would not promote the usage of them to anyone that doesn't know what they are getting themselves into, but it does give me the feeling that there is something to it.   \n\n\nThe documentary on Netflix \"Fantastic Funghi\" shows a lot on how these mushrooms allow humans to treat trauma that has corrupted certain developments in the human brain. Also, it shows how on a microscopic level these Funghi in many ways operate similarly to the human brain. And it just shows me that in a way there is a bit of God in everything and that in everything and everyone there is the goodness of God to be found. Since we all originate from the 1 source, doing the right thing would be seeing the good in everything just like god did. Instead of debating everything, just seeing that all of us are facing the same suffering due to the development of the prefrontal cortex. The prefrontal cortex for example also manages our dopamine and serotonin, which can also contribute to our lusty nature. Us trying to protect everyone is actually the fear of the external while everything serves it's purpose in a way. In order to overcome our fears we only have to realise there was nothing to fear in the first place? What does it matter if anyone steals some of your material good, you are alive and healthy enough to see that the only value is love and unfortunately the other person who chose to steal from you lacks it. Isn't that a reason to feel sorry for that persons state of mind rather than angry? His mind of a predator to own something that is by default dead anyways, just to cover for his own lack of self-value and love.   \n\n\ni hope this makes sense. I have studied a lot of different topics and a lot of time went down before these puzzle pieces all started falling together in my head. I am completely aware that some will not be happy and agree with this, but the bible just makes so much more sense to me in this narrative. It just shows me the beauty and depth of it more.   \n\n\nI presume that not many know that Jesus went to India to study for approximately 14 years. He didn't have a bible and it is common place for the guru's and mystics there to have no problem with snakes for example. Practicing to manage life energy and through that being able to heal people by hand and actually perform miracles. I'm in no way dismissing the bible here. There are modern practices like Reiki for example that are based on the same type of healing that are described and spoken of as similar to miracles performed by Jesus.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJust to add this has anyone heard of the term Christ Consciousness:\n\n[https://www.yogapedia.com/definition/5806/christ-consciousness](https://www.yogapedia.com/definition/5806/christ-consciousness)\n\nThis is just the first website that popped up on google, but there are many that are familiar with the term. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI just hope to help anyone who is trying to grasp the understanding behind many things the bible says, because i always have this sense that people make the subconscious mistake of using scriptures to fit their own narrative. Rather than achieving their state of enlightenment for which the bible actually serves they expect the bliss to come in the afterlife, but only complain about the suffering that they face in this life.\n\nIsn't if funny how repents is an anagram for serpent. We should repent that someone fears us and considers us a serpent when we all mean good for each other. Therefore we should not face each other as fears. That's the unfortunate reality of our current media corporates, they use our own insecurities and fears in their favour, but there is nothing to fear. Babylon might be more present than people think it is. The tower of babel is a tower of power that is less powerful than many think, because it is based on the fear that others might be angry for our sins and sin against us. A lot are worshipping the devil, because the devil is an insecure liar that manipulates others in favour of himself, while God sees past that and knows the devil is just the outcome of people sinning. The devil doesn't exist. It is fears from the past that we project on others, which is unfair. How is another individual responsible for something they have not contributed to. Live and Evil. Remember that. Don't limit others out of own insecurities or fears to take action in own hands. People use each other to get their own needs, at cost of other people.  It is as if tree grows to the left, but you think it will fall on your house growing over it, so you push it to the right, making the tree ultimately die. That's what we do to each other, spiritually killing each other telling each other what is good and what is wrong because of the intimidation we feel from being outclassed. That's why parents can't bond with their kids, because they fear their kids will not be able to Live in trying to achieve the things they want to achieve, but limiting them they ultimately actually do not let them live they want to live so the kids consider their parents a problem. That's why we should just let everyone live the way they want as long as it is not at the cost of another.\n\nThe forbidden fruit wasn't the mushroom. It was fear, because everything is good, just not the thing that you fear, because that makes you consider it bad, but god already said it was good the way it was. We weren't ready to experience what these mushrooms had to offer. If god was first, he had experienced everything without the opinions of others present. And eve considered her god to be good, but since she considered him to be better she also must've felt some sort of inferiority and fear of god, she couldn't distinguish the feeling between the fear of the snake, so she believed it was the same thing. Because if god is good and fear is good, she couldn't help but eat the forbidden fruit. So the point of this story is that gods loneliness shows how much he loved us, because he gave us a partner to mate with, to love and reproduce. Without death there wouldn't be a meaning to life, without suffering there wouldn't be a meaning to happiness, but also without good their wouldn't be bad. God might've known that Eve wouldn't be able to comprehend what she experienced eating the mushroom and therefore would feel bad things like shame and therefore explaining why they covered their bodies. See, we are so out of touch with our nature and trying to hide everything in our privacy, but in reality we are just isolated from the outside world. Then again we are in the comfort of our own house, able to enjoy our own family, but then again, we are continuously in a struggle of juggling work, life and keeping everyone happy.   \n\n\nI'm not gonna make any of this longer than necessary anymore, because i could rewrite the whole bible with an explanation to every scripture, but that would take me so much time. In a way i understand why Jesus didn't write any books himself. Somehow i can see the goodness in everything and have been able to for a very long time in my life.  I just want to close with this, there is layers of meaning to the bible, and sometimes you have to look other information outside of the bible to be able to interpret the multiple layers. The more perspective you gain, the more layers you find. Not only the bible holds wisdom/knowledge though. I have studied many religions to be able to figure out they can only co-exist to make sense. There is a journey within them as a collective and when you see that everything works together, just like god put everything together, you see everything is a work of god. God works through us often, God tests us through others often, but do you fight out of fear, run away out of fear or face it as there is nothing to fear?",

        "text": "If Catholics thinks that people who piss and qhit can be saints why do they rever them?\n\nI was extremly surprised and confused by the answered I had on r/catholicism for this post:\n\nHi reddit!\n\nSo I recently had a huge interest in the story and martyrdom of Bl. Jerzy Popieluszko- Polish patron of Solidarity trade union that the secret police murdered in 1984. Despite investigated miracles, a huge popularity and the fact that he is literally a martyr he is still not a saint. I wondered why.\nThen I read his autopsy report. First, they said that what caused his death was that he \"chocked on his blood and vomit\". Definitely a sign that it was not a \"holy\" martyrdom. Secondly I read in a book investigating his death called \"Popieluszko you will be crucified\" that the police reported to his parishioners that he pissed himself when he was tortured. And again, not roses. A christian martyr does not behave like that in death, right?\n\nBut when I asked it on Fb under publications on that precise topic they were mad at me and blocked me.\nDoes that mean it is the case? I mean if Jerzy was √† saint he would not produce filth, or at least clean one, and even more not during martyrdom. This silence and the fact even his family declared they were upset. That mean they were ashamed he died vomiting.\n\nTherefore, this existential question: is Popieluszko not a saint because he pissed himself ? And therefore died in impurity ? Therefore JP2 having been d√©pendant on a colostomy bag that meant he should not have been a saint too?\"\n\nPeople thought I was √† troll, not for stating that someone like Popieluszko not only had dirty blood and produced urine but also Web himself like a hobbo. No for implying it could impede him for being a saint. Even posted blasphemies such as even Virgin Mary pooped or something. So are them really christians ?\n\nBut isnt poop a filthy demonic matter ? In the Name of the Rose by Umberto Eco monts were very clear about it. The canonisation of JP2 was extremly controversial and I find ridicule that Poland paid such a cult to √† man that produced fecal matter. If I follow the logic of christianity a person who poop, vomit or piss himself cant be saint. But why were the r/catholic such in denial?\n\nI love Popieluszko, but despite of this answers, I think it is impossible that the Holy See sanctifies a martyrdom when the guy peed and vomited, and not roses. A saint s body precisely dont react like that, as we see in the martyrs of Early Christianity. Saints are already chosen by god and are biologically sup√©riors. Thats une unequal but thats how it works.\n\nWhat fo you think?",
