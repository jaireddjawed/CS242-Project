        "text": "When I was in high school, a girl once told me that I was too goofy; too childish - that women wouldn't be able to take me seriously as a man if I were to continue being who I was. It stung to hear that, but it didn't do much in the way of making me want to change who I was (at the time); however, I didn't notice that it had planted an insidious seed in my psyche that would slowly corrode my sense of self over the years. As time went on, I became more self-conscious about almost every aspect in which I'd conducted myself in social scenarios, and I'd attribute it less to consistent, active thoughts, but, rather, more like habitual thoughts every now and again that caused me to cringe at myself, causing me to form an instinctive \"ugh, why am I like this?\" impression of myself. It took a couple of years, but I'd learned to really hate myself. I'd become ashamed of who I was, and I'd constantly berate myself in my own head, calling myself \"too childish\", \"too immature\", \"too loud\", \"too energetic\", \"too stupid\", \"too inept\" - you get the gist. I developed social anxiety, and, at its worst, I wasn't able to leave my home for 2 years. Just looking at the front door was enough to make me break out in cold sweat and make my heart beat faster. Thankfully (?), due to the pandemic, I was able to stay another 2 years in my home without barely leaving the house (unless for groceries and whatnot), so I'd spent 4 years crumbling away, becoming more socially inept and self-hating. A couple of months ago, I'd gotten laid off from my job, and I started to fall into a horrible spiral of self-hate again. It was horrible. But then, for whatever reason, last night, I'd asked myself a bizarre question: \"Is it even worth keeping people around me if they don't like who I am?\". This led to other thoughts like, \"I'm sick and tired of being so sad all the time\" and \"life is about quality, not quantity, so I should focus more on the 2 people who decide to stay by my side, regardless of who I am, rather than the 20 people on my side because I'm being fake and trying my best to be someone I'm not\". I still have a lot of issues to work through. I still have a lot of thoughts. But, at the very least, I've taken the first step forward.\n\nIf you're in the same boat as me (that is, having the habit of overly criticizing yourself and hating yourself), however way you got there, just know that, in the end, nobody is worth keeping if they don't like you for who you are, so just be you (so long as \"you\" doesn't mean that you're hurting or bothering others). I was in high school when I'd started questioning who I was in a negative light. I'm in my 30s now, and I'm just starting to learn to realize that, in the grand scheme of things, it doesn't really matter so long as you're kind and caring of others; that will most likely (hopefully) overshadow things like goofiness and childishness. Time flies. It isn't worth it to fill life up with negative energy. At least, that's what I believe right now.",

        "text": "I've been talking with ChatGPT a lot because it's easier to express my thoughts, regardless of their depth or \"stupidity,\"  when I know that the receiving end is a machine that couldn't care less is I sound stupid, pretentious, wrong, or annoying. (it also makes writing smoother since I don't pay much attention to using correct language). Here's an excerpt from our last conversation:\n\n*me:* *I genuinely feel like I'm missing a very important concept or key to life. some idea that I'm close to and it's very obvious but I just can't seem to fathom it. as if it's unlocked at level 2 and I've been living in level 1 of life all my life. I've always felt like this. can you tell me what the secret of life is? What am I missing? What is everyone overlooking? and are there some people who have solved the puzzle but are unable to share the winning strategy? If yes, is it because they can't share it, because we wouldn't understand it, or because they don't want others to learn it?*\n\n*chatgpt: The idea of a \"secret to life\" is a philosophical concept that has been debated and explored by people for centuries. There is no single answer or solution that applies to everyone, as the meaning and purpose of life can be different for each individual. However, some common themes that people have found to bring meaning and fulfillment to their lives include:*\n\n1. *Connection with others: Building strong relationships with loved ones, friends, and community can provide a sense of belonging and support.*\n2. *Pursuit of passions and interests: Engaging in activities and hobbies that bring joy and fulfillment can provide a sense of purpose and meaning.*\n3. *Personal growth and self-discovery: Taking time to reflect on one's values, beliefs, and goals, and working to become the best version of oneself can lead to a greater sense of well-being and satisfaction.*\n4. *Giving back to others: Engaging in acts of kindness and generosity, and contributing to causes larger than oneself can bring a sense of fulfillment and purpose.*\n\n*It's important to remember that these are general principles, and what works for one person may not work for another. The key is to explore and discover what brings meaning and fulfillment to your own life.*\n\n*As for the idea of someone having the \"winning strategy\" but being unable to share it, this is largely a matter of perspective. Some people may have insights or perspectives that are valuable to them but difficult to convey to others, while others may believe that the meaning of life is something that must be discovered and experienced for oneself. Ultimately, the \"secret of life\" is something that each person must determine for themselves based on their own experiences and beliefs.*",

        "text": "For context, I’m 25, graduated in HS in 2015. I don’t really feel like it was that long ago that I graduated, but a lot has changed since then, it seems. When I was in high school, my school had a small handful of AP classes that juniors and seniors could take for college credit, along with an optional half-day “jumpstart” into vocational experience (mostly just shadowing someone in a field you’re interested in), but I only knew of one person in my graduating class who actually signed up for the half-day experiences senior year.\n\nAnyways, one night I was reminiscing on high school, and just for shits and giggles, I went on my old school’s website and looked at this school year’s handbook to see if anything has changed since I graduated. Turns out, a *lot* has changed. Nowadays, my school is having high school freshmen think much more seriously about college options right from the get go, whereas that was just a passing suggestion when I was a freshman. Not only that, but there are way more options for college credit pre-graduation - many more AP classes, dual enrollment, high school courses that directly translate to college courses, etc. The handbook makes it seem as though if you are not partaking in the older half-day vocational experience, you should be filling up your schedule with these college courses. There’s also been the implementation of part-time night classes and asynchronous online classes for students who work full-time during the day. I don’t think I knew of a single classmate who had a full-time job in high school, much less during the day. I’m sure it wasn’t unheard of, but it certainly wasn’t common enough for schools to have full-blown programs for students in these positions.\n\nMaybe there has been a culture shift since covid, or maybe my old high school is an exception, but it seems as though teenagers nowadays are being shoved into mini adult roles way early on. I was still very much an immature kid at 14-17, and I don’t know how I would’ve reacted to having college-level responsibilities at that age. What are your thoughts?",

The interview didn’t go bad by any means, it actually went pretty good, I just know they could probably find better. I had just finished my 8 hour shift when I did the interview, so I wasn’t at the top of my game. I was doing a lot more ums and uhhs then I should have. Not as much confidence and assertiveness as I feel like a leader should have. Which sucks because I feel like Im really capable of the job and I really enjoy what I do. My bosses have seen me work so they know i’m capable, it’s just so anxiety inducing knowing that when it came down to getting interviewed I didn’t mention my strongest points or best moments because I was so anxious.",

        "text": "This is a very long and somewhat funny story.\n\nI moved to Indianapolis from Ann Arbor about 6 months ago. The adjustment has been difficult for me.\n\nPeople here are very different from people there, my street harassment quotient has gone way up, and I see litter everywhere. I am an environmental engineer and an environmentalist in general, so I struggle to live peacefully with the knowledge that there is a lot of litter nearby.\n\nI have been trying to clean up the litter in a specific local park for some time now. I've actually started to make some progress, and over the last two weeks, I've worked with unhoused community members in the park to collect about 15 55-gallon bags of trash in this park. That's a lot and I'm very proud.\n\nOne thing that Indiana has in common with Michigan is that it gets cold here in the winter. The unhoused community members told me that they get very cold and that it is illegal for them to have campfires on the ground. When I put up trash cans in the park, they started lighting fires in the trash cans because doing so is legal, especially because they are not city-sanctioned trash cans, so they seem like burn barrels to \"the law.\" \n\nBurning things in barrels is inconvenient, so I asked the residents if they would prefer a fire pit, like the kind people put in their backyards, metal discs on a stand. They very enthusiastically said yes so I immediately started looking for fire pits on Facebook marketplace and Craigslist. \n\nYesterday, I found one for $5 on Facebook marketplace. Perfect! A little used? Yes. But suitable for burning things, and easier to use than a barrel. \n\nI went to pick it up. I was supposed to get it at 6:30 after work and dinner, but a work meeting ran about an hour and a half late, so I actually got it at 7:15.\n\nI was so excited to bring the fire pit home, clean it up with some steel wool, spray paint it, and deliver it tomorrow.\n\nWhile cleaning it, I found that I had inadvertently brought a big cockroach into my apartment. I cannot overemphasize the size of this creature. Imagine a baby's foot or a mouse. This is the scale of creature we're talking about here.\n\nI have a personal issue with killing bugs, I cannot do it, especially bugs large enough that I would then have to dispose of their corpse. I can't do it, it is a psychological block for me, and frankly it is getting to be a major inconvenience in my life.\n\nI can't deal with dead animals in general, before moving to Indiana I found a dead frog in my apartment and I had to call a friend who lived half an hour away to come help me deal with this frog. They couldn't show up the same day, so that night I slept in the living room because the frog was in my bedroom. Just so you have an idea of what kind of person I am when it comes to dead things. At the time of calling my friend, I was also not 100% sure that the object was a frog, because upon seeing it I freaked out and could not reenter my bedroom.\n\nSo anyways, I immediately take the fire pit and put it in the hallway of my apartment building. I realize that this place the cockroach where it could conceivably get into my neighbor's apartments, but that was simply not the issue at the top of my mind. I had to get this creature out of my apartment immediately. I then determined that I had to check for any friends of the creature.\n\nI found one in my front closet and trapped it under an empty pasta sauce jar while I considered what to do. I found another near my vacuum and trapped it with the wire lid of the fire pit, which I immediately placed in the hallway. \n\nAfter about half an hour of panicking, I figured out what I could do to get rid of the creatures without inviting them into the homes of my neighbors. I slid a piece of cardboard under the sauce jar and brought the bug to my apartment building's trash chute. The bug was so large that I could hear its footsteps on the cardboard. Loud. I lifted the jar and quickly threw the cardboard down the chute. One down, two to go.\n\nBoth cockroaches had very politely stayed in the hallway approximately where I had put them, and it was pretty easy to toss them down the chute as well. I figure that this way, everyone wins. My neighbors and I are cockroachless, and the roaches get sent directly to a pile of rotting food and other trash (it is my understanding that they love this).\n\nThen it dawned on me: I had brought the fire pit to my apartment in my car. My brand new car. Fear struck.\n\nI do not have a regular flashlight, so I grabbed my UV flashlight, the purple kind, and the fire pit, and went down to my apartment building's garage. I searched my car for half an hour and did not find any creatures, so I assume that none are present. I am currently storing the fire pit under, but not inside, my car. I feel that this will prevent the fire pit from acting as a vector for further creatures to enter anyone's home while still clearly demonstrating that it belongs to me and is not up for grabs.\n\nI am still quite rattled, I'm going to take a shower and hopefully go to sleep soon. Does anyone else have any bug stories, strategies, tales, or otherwise?",

Each one usually around $20. \n\nWhen I saw the rock climbing one I paused, do I want to buy the rock climbing DLC, or do I want to *go* rock climbing? \n\nThe answer is I want to go, I can go to a rock climbing gym for $18 (including shoe and gear rental), sure it's a one time visit, but I feel like I'll get more value out of that than having my sims rock climb. \n\nI get really zoned into the game, I can sink 10 hours into the game and it feels like no time has passed. \n\nSometimes the game comes too close to real life, such as when the sims are on high autonomy, they gravitate heavily towards any computer within the vicinity. 🙃\n\nIn those moments, it forces me to take stock of what I'm doing. \n\nI used to have an issue with toxic productivity, and maybe those moments of snapping back to reality are a holdover of those days. \n\nWhen I get those moments, I have to put the game down for awhile (weeks or months) before I feel ready to play it again. \n\nIt's probably for the best, but it's a really weird feeling and I'm not sure what to think of it. \n\nI still haven't bought the rock climbing DLC and I still haven't been rock climbing.\n\nI haven't bought it because I want to go rock climbing and I haven't gone rock climbing because I'm still recovering from shin splints, but it is the goal to go when I am able.",

If you want to post a different type, see these other 20 subreddits which will also instantly remove your post.\"\n\nNot only do I find this kind of ridiculous - who cares to exercise such tight control of what people say on an online forum? - it seems that this fosters an attitude and social culture of timidity, submission, deference and most of all extreme conformity.

He said it was likely a normal variant (slightly tilted heart) but ordered an echocardiogram to be sure. I got that and they said it was \"normal but on the lower end of normal\". They then ordered a cardiac MRI.\n\nThe results from that showed that I likely had a prior case of myocarditis.

        "text": "I'm not sure who to tell this since everyone of my friends in real life never really struggle this much with self discipline and studying so they don't understand how much of an achievement this is to me. I was never really good at studying and always lacked motivation and focus. I'm studying a major I absolutely love but having to listen and read for hours always felt like torture to me. Found out about a year ago that I have ADHD. But even after getting pills I failed most of my exams. The worst was that I often knew I could be good at the topics if I'd just prepare properly.\n\nNow I'm in exam phase again and it finally seems to be actually going well. I'm two days into studying and have already finished half of the material for my first exam that is in a week. We also had to write a paper and I thought mine was absolutely terrible but I put a lot of work into it and actually got pretty good reviews on it! I'm studying 4-5 hours every day and to some that might not be much but I've never been this productive in my whole life. I always used to be so disappointed when people had high hopes in me just for me to try to finish everything one day before a deadline and completely ruin it. \n\nWhen I tell my friends that I'm studying they just go \"Yeah obviously? It's exam phase\". But to me it's really special and I actually feel happy while studying as well and for once I don't want to just barely pass but actually get a good grade at the subjects that I love.",
