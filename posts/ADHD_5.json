I will delete this after I hear from you guys :)\n\nWe both have ADHD, she's hearing with a good job and I'm deaf on SSDI that is currently interviewing for a part-time job and studying with the goal of getting Master's.\n\nBasically, grandmother's dying days and the aftermath recently wiped my savings and took up much of my life. She decided to support me during that time and I see so much progress in myself mentally, socially, and career-wise. I realized it's because she gives me stability and security. I did explain to her what's my action plan to go back to full time job but we only talked about her support until my rent lease expires and not until I get a job. We are trying to talk about $$ but it's hard... We agreed to try and talk about it this Saturday.\n\nI spoke with my therapist because I want to protect my relationship with my sister and let her live her life, too. What I need predictability, yet not take advantage of my sister. I want to ask my sister to continue supporting me. She said that it would be a good idea if I were to track my income/expenses and do research of what my possible budget would be after rent expires, basically itemize them and present them to my sister so she has a clear understanding of what my budget/expenses/goals are and decide however she wants to support me until I get my full time job, if she wants to.\n\nMy life is in free form right now as I am going to interviews for jobs, and trying to have enough money to pay bills. While I keep my expenses within my means by avoiding credit cards or loans, they are all over the place with lots of different methods/accounts or cash. I have Mint but it isn't really that helpful to me because I can't seem to turn off the shared bank accounts/credit debts that are not mine and was wondering what are strategies and apps I can use that makes it easier to track my expenses and what is be best way to present my budget to my sister? She's pretty good with Excel, by the way.\n\nThanks!",

I was so proud of myself last year for getting through all of the startup hurdles and getting my first sale. It took the entire year to do it because of my adhd. It was so hard and because of my adhd I ended up paying someone to help draft a few posts to get me going since that was a major barrier I was facing. 2023 was going to be the year to really get it going, marketing, growing, etc. \n\nUnfortunately, my son who also has adhd had to be pulled from public school and is now homeschooling so on top of a full time job and raising two kids, I'm creating curriculum and ensuring his education which leaves literally no time for my business. I know there's absolutely no way I  can do the freelance even though I  have a business that wants to hire me but I dont know what to do with the etsy side. I'm devastated and angry and lost. Lol.\n\nMy options are 1) shut it all down because I  won't  have time to work on it which feels like failure, 2) keep paying current fees and costs even though I won't  have time to work on it which feels like bleeding money and wasteful, or 3) paying a friend more money to continue to post my designs and do some marketing which feels insane because I'm already in the negative and my profit margins are currently  so small.  \n\nAnyone out there have any advice?",

        "text": "I’ve been on adhd meds for around 8 months, and they worked perfectly up until the last month or so. I’m in the UK so i can’t just book an appointment with my adhd doctor to speak about this -I have to wait until a review which i think are yearly, so thought I’d turn to reddit. (I also can’t afford to see anyone privately because this country is f*cked and I’m barely surviving as is). \n\nMy medications:\n\n-\tMorning: 50mg Elvanse (vyvanse/ Lisdexamfetamine)\n-\tAfternoon: 10mg Amfexa (dexamfetamine)\n\nInitially, they worked really well and i was actually a functioning adult. I didn’t experience any noticeable side effects, other than a dry mouth and occasional feeling a little cold.\n\nFor the past month I’ve had no energy and even struggle to wake up on a morning (even after taking my med). I’d normally wake up feeling refreshed and not struggle to muster the energy to start my day.\n\nI usually come around an hour or two after getting out of bed but even then there’s still a slight feeling of tiredness/ brain fog. Then I’ll have a dip for a few hours until i take my afternoon dose. Again, i sort of come around for an hour. Today and yesterday I’ve also been quite ‘snappy’ and easily annoyed.\n\nMy adhd symptoms are still less noticeable than before meds, i just have no energy and constant brain fog. \n\nI tried to take a day off my meds on Saturday to see if that made a difference, but ended up taking my afternoon dose at midday because i was very lethargic and couldn’t do anything that i wanted to (due to worse adhd symptoms).\n\nI’ve read up on ‘crashes’ from meds but most of the advice are things that I’m already doing-\n\n-\tI get plenty of exercise (10k steps/day and gym a couple of times per week) (although I’ve not had the energy to go to the gym for the last couple of weeks)\n-\tI drink plenty of water\n-\tI have a pretty varied &amp; healthy diet and make sure to take in enough calories \n-\tI get 7+ hrs of sleep most nights\n-\tI don’t drink many caffinated drinks (other than a cup of tea with breakfast and occasionally at work)\n-\tI avoid any dietary supplements until later in the day so that they don’t effect the meds\n\n\nI’d love to hear if others have experience this after being on meds for quite a while. Does anyone have any advice or tips on how i could try to improve this?\n\nThanks in advance!",

I’ve taken medication vacations about once a year, in part due to changes in insurance preventing me from being able to see a provider. I’ve noticed that my skin has gotten so much worse since taking adderall or Vyvanse (I tried both). I break out often, I have more redness and comedonal acne and it’s on my face, neck, and back, but a week or two into a medication vacation and my skin clears up completely. I have an appointment with a dermatologist in 6 weeks and I’m really hoping they can help. \n\nHas anyone else has issues with breakouts related to ADHD meds? Has anything helped? \n\nMy skin issues are making me feel more depressed and it’s affecting my mental health but my life has improved so much with adderall that I’m reluctant to stop taking it despite the horrible acne it’s giving me.",

        "text": "For over a decade i dealt with a sleuth of mental issues, nothing particularly detrimental or serious enough to worry others, but alot of small traits that added all together felt very heavy. \n\nWhen i’d go to the psychiatrist, it all boiled down to the issues that seemed to stick out the most. Anxiety, depression, poor eating/sleeping habits and getting overwhelmed easily. \n\nI’d always get prescribed anti-depressants (ssri’s) and even at one point Klonopin. These medications only heightened my symptoms and made them much worse, even at one point trying to jump out of my mother’s car on the highway. It wasn’t until i met my new psychologist, that he realized i showed an immense amount of symptoms relative to ADHD. Which being undiagnosed and into adulthood is extremely hard on people. All people see is the tip of the iceberg but not the effects that sit under the water. \n\nFinding the right medicine was hard though. Instant release never seemed to get me through the day and felt too harsh on the comedown. Adderall was personally a nightmare. Strattera somehow even worse, it caused me to sweat alot and feel overheated. Adderall just made me angry and hate the world around mid-day and ive never been one to be angry, or even slightly annoyed by most things. I also couldn’t eat on adderall because i’d throw up, even just chewing was hard because i didn’t want to swallow my food. \n\nI was originally on concerta (brand name, as its the only adhd medication that’s generic isnt equivalent.) but then the nationwide shortage/backorder caused it to be impossible to find, especially in a highly populated area. Id have to drive 3 hours out once a month to a country town to even get my prescription so they switched me to vyvanse. \n\nVyvanse helps, and it’s certainly better than no medication. The comedown isnt bad, and i sleep just fine. I can eat just fine, too but i do get full faster and my weight has dropped drastically. Ive never been even chubby so for me this isn’t exactly a positive thing, but overall i’d say its very effective and smooth. The only issue i have with vyvanse it seems i get resistant to it alot faster than concerta. Takes about a month for me to need a dose increase where as concerta i was actually good on the 36mg for a good two months. Vyvanse seems to last shorter, 7 hours vs 10 or so. And i do notice the comedown, and just become a little less social and slightly overwhelmed in social settings, but still not bad enough to call for any complaints. It just takes a little longer for me to process thoughts at the end of the night, and i do end up oversleeping probably due to the crash. Vyvanse does give you slightly more motivation than concerta, but it also can dull your personality a bit. With insurance its also cheaper (for me, $25 a month because it doesnt have a generic, so my insurance covers the brand name) \n\nI ended up switching back to concerta for these reasons. \n\nIt lasts longers. You dont notice the comedown, and you can enjoy food any moment of the day. You do have to push yourself to do a task, but once your focused, it works the same as vyvanse. It meets you halfway. The first week youll be tired and yawn alot, this is normal. It takes a bit for your body to get used to. You can drink at the end of the night, if you take it atleast 6-8 hours prior. Im not a drinker but i do enjoy having a moscow mule or two with my dad when he comes into town, where as one beer will cause an instant hangover on vyvanse. It doesnt dull my personality at all, I still feel like my complete self but with more control. I dont talk over people as bad, and it keeps me less distracted. \n\nYou cant take cough medicine on vyvanse. Both have chemicals that give you dopamine and can cause serotonin syndrome. Its also a headache to skip your meds for a day or 3. So you have to suffer through the symptoms of being sick. Concerta you can take as needed. Concerta doesnt give you dopamine but it blocks your brain from depleting your dopamine. \n\nBoth are highly effective and helpful, but one might suit your lifestyle/personality better. The unfortunate part of concerta is the only generic that was effective was made my Patriot, and they discontinued it. Brand name is roughly $430 and thats with insurance. Its about $500 a month without. A price im willing to pay to live a healthier life, but for some people thats an arm and a leg. \n\nI felt the need to share my personal experience as it was a tough journey for me to figure out what worked the best for me , but I understand everyone’s chemistry is different and we all have different effects to things.",

        "text": "I know this isn't purely an ADHD thing, but I do feel like it's one of those things that we need to handle differently.   \nMy focus is a little sketch in the morning until my meds kick in. Then I have about 4 hours where if I'm good about doing Pomodoros I can actually stay on track with work. Then when my brain starts wandering I break for lunch.   \n\n\nProblem is, my brain will start wandering off again about 2-3 hours after lunch even if I'm being really good about getting up and moving around on my Pomodoro breaks. Eventually it wanders far enough that reining it in becomes less a focus issue and more a complete failure of executive function. \n\nDoes anyone have any tricks for how to get executive function back once it's gone? Or how to catch my focus before it wanders too far and trick it into going back to work stuff?   \n\n\nDo I need to switch to something other than Pomodoros after lunch? Or change the length or something? \n\nMy job is really boring but I'm finally making a living wage for the first time in my life so am trying to make it work.   \n\n\nAny tips appreciated.",

But if I had a job that required me to learn these skills, I would be working my hardest to learn them well. \n\nAnyone else have this? Where you struggle to do things on your own such as learning skills and personal projects but if you had to do the same things for someone else, you would be able to get it done?\n\n**TLDR: Anyone else struggle to find the motivation do things on their own such as teach themselves skills and do personal projects, whereas if you had to do those things for someone it would be much easier? **",

        "text": "I (33F) was diagnosed with ADHD unexpectedly this week. I’ve always scored as ‘no’ or ‘maybe’ on the verbal questionnaires because I’ve consistently found a way to perform well at school and work, so I did not see this coming. I have severe anxiety and was adjusting medication, and my psych wanted to do the computer test just to rule it out. I scored in the 99th percentile. I’ve always had this hope that once I got my anxiety under control, all of my mental distress would go away. Nothing has really changed but I feel extreme grief. I’ve spent my whole life hating myself for having anxiety and ‘not being able to get it together’. I’m not sure if I’m more upset about being blindsided, having to let go of who I thought I could be, spending decades self torturing over something that I couldn’t even fix, or letting go of my self hatred and embracing acceptance of an imperfect self. I’m sad.",

So I wasn’t sure what to expect after reading all the posts on here.\n\nAnyway, at the hour mark, I got a little disappointed because I was still procrastinating on an assignment while I was waiting for it to kick in and I didn’t feel anything different. But then my mom called me and asked me to sort out a medical bill and I did it right away. And I didn’t even scroll through my phone when we were calling!!!\n\nMy mom asks me to do this about once a month, but I usually put it off for several weeks until my mom calls me back one or two more times and just make all the calls on a random day when I remember (writing this just made me remember I’ve been putting off a medical supply order since December). The only time I did it right away was when a bill for $5k was sent to collections and I was having an anxiety attack over it lol. \n\nI know it’ll seem like something trivial for neurotypicals, but I just felt so happy when I realized. It happened so naturally that I didn’t even notice at first, and I actually processed everything she was saying in the moment. \n\nSorry for rambling (another ADHD habit I have 🤪) but I just feel so excited thinking about what I can get done now :)",

But I don't always have a friend in my pocket (lol) - and paradoxically spending too much time w/ppl sometimes actually exhausts me - I've yet to figure out how/why that is, and if it's in very specific situations (so far I think it's just any group larger than 3 people).\n\nI've been advised that things like Reddit / watching TV / gaming on my phone are too stimulating and a) stimulate my brain too much and exhaust me just in a different way and/or b) suck me in --&gt; I waste an hour before realizing that I've zoned out. \n\nSo far, listening to music (some of these jazz playlists on youtube are nice!), bantering w/ppl on discord, grabbing a coffee / banana, or walking aimlessly for \\~10 minutes have had mixed results. I recently bought an eye cap and might just try to do nothing / rest my brain and entertain myself with my thoughts for the duration of a break - but I'd like other ideas. In case it matters, I will be on Adderall (10mg IR) when taking these breaks. Any thoughts?",

Anyone in the same situation, or perhaps taking medication for longer than me, that can help me get some perspective ?",

I don’t want to be. It’s not even a sexual infatuation. I think I always wish we could’ve been friends. It’s too late though. They live thousands of miles away and it’s just not going to happen. I am happily married and so are they. Whenever he pops into my head I remind myself that they are married and I think of their wife and then get so annoyed at myself for even thinking of them. Ugh, I don’t want to be considered “obsessed” with them. I’m wondering if this is a symptom of ADHD? Could it be OCD? I don’t even want to bring it up to my doc because this is something I’ve had for like 20 years. I’m wondering if my brain has just created a huge thought pattern and it’s comfortable for it to go there. Any help or suggestions would be appreciated.",

I have this tendency when I leave a city, move from a house, leave a job, leave a school, etc to burn a lot of my bridges with people there. When I do it I feel like there are often valid reasons for it. Maybe there are issues that had been festering and leaving makes it easier to not ignore those issues. Or maybe sometimes I create issues by focusing on the bad and ignoring the good in our relationship. Maybe I preemptively put someone in the rearview mirror as a hard reset or because I can't focus on more than one thing at a time. Maybe it's about control. Maybe it's because my dad left all the time when I was a kid and my mom was never fully present so I am afraid of losing people and want to be the one who leaves first. Idk. But the hot/cold part of this pattern is very familiar to me because of my ADHD. I will suddenly feel cold about someone, even if we've had wonderful experiences together. This must contribute to it. I feel like a bad person. I feel bad for the hurt and confusion I cause. I'm trying to be really careful of this pattern right now and not burn bridges with my friends in the city I'm moving from soon. It's scary and I don't understand it.",
