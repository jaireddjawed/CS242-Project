        "text": "Often on Reddit (and internet discussion at-large) serious subjects are debated at length by people who represent themselves as an expert on the topic at hand rather than a participant in an exchange of ideas. Very rarely do opposing viewpoints seek a conciliatory position of mutual understanding or common ground but rather to somewhat aggressively dismiss an opposing viewpoint entirely. Because this approach leaves no room for nuance, discussions are often reduced to arguing over what is fact and what is not fact. \n\n\nWhy this is has to do with the nature of the discussion -- it has an audience judging a winner through upvotes, in essence, but *how* it is I believe is because of the existence of Wikipedia.\n\n\nReddit is wiki-like itself, soliciting not a diverse population for its ideas and interests but a population only with common ideas and common interests. This is why it is so unique and maybe even valuable for a society but also why it cannot never itself replace one. \n\n\nWhen it comes to the marketplace of ideas, Reddit certainly is one, however ideas are often arrived at from a marketplace of fact. And there's only one source so immediately accessible where facts have been similarly disputed over than Wikipedia, or for that matter, any encyclopedia. So what discussion becomes more often than not, if you look closely, is a debate over how the fact must be reasonably interpreted other than a discussion about how the other arrived at their own interpretation. It is not unlike a trial where facts are held to scrutiny already established (in this case, \"The Wikipedia Standard\" I'd call it) instead of being an exercise in fact-finding.\n\n\nI conclude my probably pretentious (can't help it, Reddit fascinates and infuriates) little theory with this -- Reddit would not exist without Wikipedia (and by philosophical extension, blogs) because no discussion would ever take place if both sides hadn't already agreed upon a common source of facts rather than a common understanding of their nuance.\n",

        "text": "^[By the 90/9/1 rule, we mean the hypothesis that 90% of Reddit users simply read, 9% upvote/downvote, and 1% actually comment.   This is slightly different from the rule as it relates to other online communities (where the 9% refers to commenting, and the 1% to creation).  Posting new threads/creating subreddits themselves is likely a significantly smaller proportion of Reddit's userbase, one that might be harder to estimate.]  \n\n\n* **There are approximately 8 million Reddit accounts.**  Why?  Because [the top eleven subreddits, which have all existed since the site's inception, have between 7.5 and 7.99 million users.](http://redditmetrics.com/top)   Given that these subreddits are all so close in terms of user numbers despite being so different in terms of interests (gaming, science, pictures etc..) one can surmise that most users do not bother unsubscribing to defaults, at least not individually (because then the original ten subs would likely have markedly different subscriber numbers).  In addition, the chance of a user unsubscribing from /r/Announcements, seems extremely low, given that announcements are highly rare and relatively unobtrusive, the sub has no special interest or political/religious content, and is entirely uncontroversial.  Therefore, r/Announcements gives us the best estimate of the total number of Reddit users at 7.993m.  Perhaps the total including the small number of unsubscribers might slightly exceed 8m on the dot.  \n\n* Last month, Reddit had [basically 160m users](http://reddit.com/about).  That means that, taking our guesswork further, the *total amount of (undeleted) Reddit accounts in history, amounts to just under 5% of the monthly uniques*.  This already blows the 90/9/1 rule (for the community as a whole) out of the water.  While individual subreddits have varying ratios (music/picture subs have a large upvote:comment ratios, askreddit on the other hand has the opposite), in the community as a whole it literally would not even be possible for more than about 5% of unique users to upvote or downvote posts, given the number of account holders.  \n\n* Now, how many people actually comment on Reddit posts?  (The '1'%) of the rule.   The two subreddits with the generally largest number of comments on top posts are /r/askreddit and /r/IAMA.   Top posts in history on them tend to average between 15,000 and 45,000 comments.   I have yet to find a post that received above 50,000 or 60,000 legit comments. Given that according to the about page, the number of logged in daily users is about 1.8m, or a little less than a quarter of total accounts, and assuming, once again, that MOST users are subscribed to the top 10 or 11 defaults (which is a reasonably assumption imho), then we *could* make some guesses as to the percentage of subscribers/accounts that comment on top posts in default subs, if we knew how many unique comments a given thread have.  \n\n* But lets say for the sake of argument that half the total number of comments in an IAMA or AskReddit equals the number of unique commenters.  This seems reasonable because while the top comments can often lead to chains with hundreds or even thousands of sub comments, there are always many thousands of comments that languish, alone, at the bottom of the pile at +1 or 0 karma. \n\n* Thus, given a generous estimate of 50,000 comments for the highest possible commenting total ever, and our estimate that 50% of that (ie 25,000) equals the total unique commenters on the piece, and there are about 1.8m accounts online per day, the vast vast majority of which are subscribed to the top defaults, we can surmise that AT MOST, *ever*, 1.3% of online *accounts* on that day commented on the most commented post of all time. \n\nOnce again, this is a massive ongoing ramble, but I think it's clear that the reality could well be more like the 98/1.9/0.1 rule, instead of what the accepted reality has been so far. \n",

[Here's a link to the results.](http://imgur.com/a/csWqG) \nIn this post, I've added a little of my speculation on what these results mean, although further discussion in the comments is welcome.\n\n* About 20% of people don't remember to upvote, which explains the [Upvote Attention Phenomenon](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/2uqfry/the_upvote_attention_phenomenon_a_post_that_draws/). Note that while it's a little less than 20%, that population is a greater fraction of potential upvoters because of those who never upvote (and aren't considered when looking at the potential voting audience).\n\n* Most users don't PM others. This was one of the most surprising results for me; I would have guessed that the fraction would be closer to 30% than 60%. Perhaps some users simply don't think to utilize this feature, which might be the cause of long conversations occurring in comment threads rather than via PM.\n\n* People are more likely to comment in the form of a reply rather than a top-level comment; this is a good thing and probably a reason why Reddit creates so much discussion.\n\n* More than 4/5 of users have never submitted a post outside of a few specific subreddits.\n\nMy intention was to analyze the responses based on account age, but I haven't found a way for Google Forms to perform a breakdown based on a given question's answer. The reason for the non-representative age sample is likely due the fact that the average redditor will not encounter /r/SampleSize for a few months or years after joining the site.

        "text": "This is a crosspost, I was encouraged to post here as I was told my analysis was a good read and suited for this sub. I also believe the discussion it could prompt in this sub would be very great and look forward to what you have to add. I hope the post is appreciated here and I'd like to read other peoples experiences and analysis.\n\n\nI’m someone who lurks only and have always found a discussion without need of posting. Someone has always said what I’d say and better and in a big thread someone has asked what I’d ask, so it’s like the conversation was already had for me I just have to read it. I’m only posting now because I’d really like to read discussion and views as I have not seen this discussed. It’d also be cool if other people can post about the most interesting emergences of patterns of behaviour in other subreddits due to the combination of hive mind and sub content. And of course what they think of the case of FPS.\n\n\nI definitely think the “fat centred” subs are the most interesting communities of intersection and interaction. Some of the subs have developed the most bizarre subreddit culture PERIOD. I remember /r/fatpeoplestories released a poll. The majority of the users on the sub were polled as overweight. This in itself is the major circle jerk that really got me head scratching but amused, **how can a sub seemingly so against fatness and the behaviour associated with fatness have mostly fat subscribers**?. I actually find this really interesting and this is the sort of strange dynamic in subs I want to discuss. To me, one explanation could be the standard, \"self loathing\" aspect, that many of the users go on there and are caught in a cycle of self hate. But I think it goes further, to put it simpler: that putting in the easy work of ranting on reddit against \"beets behaviour\" and getting the reward of validation and pats on the back. Becomes cathartic and rewarding and is a reward cycle that starts to replace the meaningful cycle of tough but responsible dieting and exercise. Having people feel they've achieved without doing much and more that I will detail..\n\n\nI couldn’t understand how the sub hadn’t imploded as a result of this poll. But oh no, actually it makes perfect sense. There is actually not much to misunderstand and the whole happenstance of the sub makes so much sense when we remember common fundamental behaviour of people with weight issues. The subreddit has actually become itself a huge conduit through which the users by their very participation display levels of hypocrisy when it comes to patterns of behaviour the sub stands against. It is bizarre looking at the community from the outside. Fatpeoplestories is meant to be against “hamplanetry” and “beetus” behaviour, the actions are ridiculed by users for the hypocrisy or stupidity and the discussion is often a source of humour for the subs. It’s all standard fare, criticism of stereotypical fat behaviour like hygiene problems, greed, laziness. It is poetic that the users of these subs invariably seem to succumb to the pattern of behaviour mocked so heavily. Someone struggling with weight gain could adopt a healthy and stable outlook on trying to lose weight but the alternative is also possible and I very often see it favoured on the subs such as fatpeoplestories. There is such a high hostility to “fatness” that it really shows in the hive mind of FPS. **The users cannot be perfect and the ideals are high and tolerance low that the “prevailing wind” of the sub is actually insecure**.\n\n\nIt's jarring to see this weird ritualistic need of OP to explain themselves to the sub at times: get used to seeing “ ok I’m 140lbs but stopped doing my daily 4k runs for 2 weeks” or stuff like that. Some even need to comprehensively explain their eating habits to the sub (on an anonymous web forum) or when posting **self stats** which are- for whatever reason- **seemingly obligatory in a story about someone else**, hurriedly justify them. There is an impression left when reading the self flagellation in a post as OP ate “Mcbeetus” but desperately adds justification that: “They hadn’t eaten since last night”. It’s just weird seeing the hive mind make people feel they have to speak of eating McDs as if it nearly killed them. When lurking there are a lot of behavioural trends that seem understandable in a sub with an aggressively low tolerance approach to weight loss. The standards being so high means that something had to give.The hivemind naturally evolved as it had to. On FPS a lot of things and attitudes concerning fatness have been redefined and this consequently skews the whole process and approach to weight problems. I have seen countless people on FPS criticise and ridicule someone for “hamplanetry” where they admit they are as overweight and on two bizarre occasions they themselves were MUCH more overweight. It just seemed comical, **that the sub actually causes people to adopt behavioural patterns to make them feel more achieved without having done anything**. When if anything you’d think in FPS of all subs the only proof and merit would be the pudding: i.e the actual quantifiable loss of weight sustained by consistent ‘non-hamplanet’ behaviour. This seems it would make more sense, rather than proving how much you “hate fat logic” by repeating hive mind talking points as an acceptable toll to pass as “non-hamplanet\".\n\n\nInterestingly,\n the whole process of subscribing to the sub, following the ideals and so on may make users a caricature of what they criticise in a bigger way than imagined. I imagine that through surrendering to the influence of one of these kind of this trap a lot of people can unwittingly become what they're against. Rather than having a healthy and sustainable way of coping with weightloss and being overweight. “Fighting against fat logic” is seen as so important, I repeatedly see people saying not being a ham planet is most important. People can be lulled into contentment despite being more unhealthy than someone because they are unaware or rationalise their own “ham planet behaviour” and as is common only see others faults. This allows them to feel they’ve achieved something just by criticising “fat logic” rather than the real act of exercise or dieting.\nThe thing that magnifies this even more is that FPS is really **Fat people FAN FICTION**. This is because the vast majority of content is fiction and fictional content is encouraged, the people who use the sub for creative writing and release 13 part series in handy installations are hugely popular. Also the content panders to the users (ever notice how phrases become ubiquitous for stories sub wide e.g \"My CONDISHUN\") . It's obvious how it is crafted to generate the desired response, so it's also in a way \"rage porn\". It's finely crafted to elicit the right amount of indignation at 'ham planet behaviour'. There’s nothing wrong with fiction, the only issue is that people respond as if all stories are real. E.g In comments “OP you should have called the cops” “Oh did this happen in X?” “ Definitely do X if Y happens”. So the sub is like fan fiction/roleplaying but bizarrely no one is self aware. I mean, there was so much drama when someone who released an 11 part series with grand finale admitted it was fiction. He'd even drummed up hype like it’s a book and the content was so pandering and community influenced (not even mentioning the believability) that it was so dumb that there was drama. And by the way, what is it with people in subs that have authors that release 13 part ridiculous stories that obviously pander? How can they not tell it is pure fiction and even become enraged when told so?\n\n\n**TL:DR:**\nnp.reddit/com/r/fatpeoplestories is a subreddit with a truly strange culture.**1** Mainly that many users cannot seem to understand if the stories are true or not and consciously or not seem to incorporate them into reality as if they were gospel. Forgetting most are 100% fictional and pandering to trends or tailored to press the right buttons to the max. **2**The sub is against 'fat logic' and 'ham planet behaviour' but as a whole seems to be a potential trap to make subscribers 'ham planets' themselves as they have redefined fatness. **So people 50lbs more obese are seen criticising someone lighter for being a 'ham planet'**. Polls show the **majority** of the subscribers are overweight or heavier . A hefty percentage are obese and a very surprising amount were morbidly obese too (Find the polls yourself but I remember certainly was around 10 percent were morbidly obese). **3** The low tolerance for fatness has made people follow a very insecure self flagellating hive mind. (I have sinned dearly by eating mcdonalds).\n\n\nI just found all this very interesting, I hope to read other peoples opinions and also discover other subreddits with bizarre hive minds or social dynamics and customs.",

Posts evolved from the originally styled rage comic format about generic problems everyone to which everyone can relate to lengthy comics detailing a specific thing that happened to OP.\n\n* /r/AdviceAnimals: Another meme based subreddit that is still incredibly popular despite being removed from the defaults. Posts there have evolved from the short generic advice animal macros to specific instances in the OP's life. They often can't fit the entire story into the image macro and post a comment detailing the entire story.\n\n* /r/AskReddit: The most popular self-post only subreddit went through a time period when no post was simply a question. Titles would tell a story about the OP with a brief question shoehorned on at the end and the body would typically have a detailed version of the story. The mods have since changed their rules to prevent this and force posts to be actual questions instead of stories.\n\n* /r/pics: Probably the most popular image based subreddit, their comment section is now often a battleground of users that dislike the current Facebook style personalization of posts. Many of the images are not interesting on their own without the context of the accompanying story. It is probably best illustrated with [this post.](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/1mdknc/rpics_we_need_to_talk/)\n\n* /r/askscience &amp; /r/AskHistorians: The mods of these subreddits do an impeccable job of keeping them high quality. A growing percentage of the posts I see that are highly upvoted have started acquiring the \"obligatory\" self congratulatory front page edits that I never saw there in the past. Even in the most strict subreddits, posters will personalize what they can get away with.\n\n\nIt's clear that users like to make their posts about themselves. It's clear that at least the silent majority doing the upvoting likes highly personalized posts. Why hasn't /r/self (or a similar subreddit that also allows images) that is explicitly devoted to Facebook styled personalized posts skyrocketed in popularity when this type of content overwhelms any subreddit it can? If a personal story subreddit were to be defaulted, do you think users would be more likely to post there and keep other subreddits less personalized?\n\nNote: I'm not trying to pass judgement on the content or specific subreddits I listed. They were simply a few large subreddits everyone is familiar with that display the trend I see across the entire site. I'd like to discuss the personalization trend in general, not those few specific subreddits.",

        "author": "Subcomfreak",
        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/2vfcxd/phenomenology_and_reddit_a_short_essay_for_my/",
        "text": "So in my philosophy class the professor wanted us to write a short paper (1-2 pages double spaced) on Heidegger's conception of the \"they\" and \"being-with\" in relation to a form of social media. I chose reddit. Below is the essay, after the essay I will make some additional comments....\n\n&gt; Heidegger gives us a conception of our relation to others called Being-with. Before understanding the concept of Being-with we must define who we are being with. Heidegger calls the others (different Dasein than an individual) who we are with the “they”. The “they” are a sort of conglomeration of the rest of society. A single individual is initially thrust into the environment of the they. In essence one starts out as being a more or less generic member of society obeying the commands and norms of what everyone else collectively says. In order to find one's self as an individual one must break with the they and somehow differentiate oneself from the rest of society. --\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;\n&gt;Being-with is a necessary part of Being-in-the-world due to the presence of others. Heidegger argues that Being-with takes the form of solicitude. In solicitude one may take two forms, either leaping in for another or leaping ahead of another. In the first form one takes up the responsibility of another and thus removes their agency. When one leaps ahead of another one  shows another how to take care of themselves in order to reveal to the other their own agency. --\n\n&gt; \tIn the realm of social media we can see these concepts in action. Take, for example, Reddit. On Reddit users post pictures, news stories, videos, personal stories, and anything else that comes to mind. What is interesting about Reddit is that there is a system in place for society to arbitrate what content is deemed “good” or “bad” by “upvoting” or “downvoting” posts. This system is an expression of the they. They decide what types of posts are good or bad. If one wishes to have “good karma”, an aggregate of up votes and down votes for one's posts, then one will have to try to align oneself with what the they deems is good. When submitting a post one essentially submits oneself to the judgment of the they. Thus, when making a post the they is an ever present force, even if there are no physical reddit users to be seen.--\n\n&gt; \tIn Reddit we can also see the concept of solicitude in action. If one looks at posts of users asking for help one can see both types of solicitude. For example, on a technology oriented “subreddit” one can see many questions about which computer components are “best” for a particular use. In some instances users respond in a form of leaping in with such posts as, “This CPU is the best, buy it.”, while others may respond by leaping ahead, “This CPU consumes less power, while this one is faster, it depends on what you need.”  Both of these posts are simultaneously being judged by the they in the form of upvotes and downvotes. In some instances the leaping in post may get more endorsement from Reddit as a whole because the majority users think that the user asking has a definitive “best” course of action, in the above the they may have deemed a certain product categorically the best. At other times the they may endorse leaping ahead when there is not an obvious “best” course of action. --\n\n&gt; \tWe can also see via Reddit how an individual Dasein can break from the they. On the same “subreddit” one can find pictures of completed user assembled computers. One posts these pictures not necessarily to show that one is part of the they, but instead to show one's own uniqueness. In this example we see that the they has not disappeared, for the they still judges this expression of individuality, but we see that the Dasein posting the pictured has wrestled away from a mandated standard and has freely expressed its agency. However, when deciding to make a post of this nature a user may feel the presence of the they in their decision to make the post in the first place. If one feels that their work is too far estranged from the preferences of the rest of Reddit a user may decide to keep their work to themselves and not display it. Thus even though the they never explicitly tells a user what to and what not to post, the force of their collective tastes implicitly influences the use of Reddit and other social media. \n\nA few comments:\nFirstly I was obviously referring to the build a pc type of subreddits.\n\nFor the uninitiated:\n\nDasein might as well as be Humans for Heidegger. A Dasein is a being for which its Being is of concern to it. This means that a Dasein or a human is interested in what it is. --\n\nReddit is interesting because by interacting with reddit we found out something about who we are. What we deem worthy of posting is indicative of who we are not only as individuals but as humans in general. The type of subreddits that get popular are an expression of the \"they\" or the totality of society as a whole. What one individually posts could be said to be an expression of who that individual person is. As noted above what society deems worthy is also part of the posting...\n\nOn a more Marxian note it seems that reddit has commodified speech to a tremendous degree. Every post that we make is assigned a quality ranking, or an exchange value in the form of up-votes and down-votes. We no longer view writing in qualitative terms (on many popular sub reddits), but in terms of the up-votes that a post gets. --\n\nIf we were to go deeper we could say that Reddit is its own \"world\" where users are \"being-in\". Meaning that a user is immersed in the world of reddit when they interact with it. One could then start applying Heidegger's other concepts to posts on reddit (ready-to-hand and present-at-hand)...\n\nAlso interesting is how small reddit has made the world. Users are nearly instantly with other users. Also interesting is that spaciality seems to be related in non-physical terms. \"You should look over there in xyz subreddit\". Spaciality is no longer physical, but more \"abstracted\", to use an inappropriate phrase. Farness and closeness seem to really be \"background\" and \"foreground\" understandings of the terms.\n\nSo yeah, this was a fun paper to write.\n",

        "text": "#Here's why:  \n* Since reddit was founded on June 23, 2005; I believe that over time, is has slowly been declining in quality.  \n\n* A high influx of users has caused all the default subreddits to be bogged down with new, clueless users, as well as; trolls, mock accounts, novelty accounts, and others of that sort. These are problematic because it causes clutter, and chaos. While *legit* new users should be held back from commenting and posting for, let's say, one week. That will give them more time get to understand reddit, and how it functions. I also think that those new users should be asked(suggested, not forced) to watch a quick video demonstrating the aspects of reddit as a whole.  \n  * I say all of that to say this: There are so many people on here who create a new account on a whim, and use those accounts to fudge numbers -ie. Upvoting their own content, upvoting their own comments, etc. etc..   \n\n* A lot of the problem is caused by the community itself. Most users seem to lack tact, and can be somewhat rude to new/confused redditors, thus causing them to be reluctant to share their true thoughts, and just 'go with the flow'. I can count numerous times where I have stated an honest opinion, and had users **butter me up like a roll,** and devour me, before I could even finish my side of the story. Reddit should be a **safe Haven** for members all across the world to feel welcome, and not to feel worried whether or not they will gain precious, yet meaningless, karma.   \n\n---  \n#How can this be addressed and fixed on a mod/community level?  \n\n* Granted, it would take a reddit-wide community effort, to change the on-goings of which are aforementioned. However, I believe that it can be done!  \n\n* First off, there **is a grey area** throughout reddit. Certain communities strive on the harassment, trolling, mocking, etc., however, I am not talking about those subreddits during this post. I am only referring to the default/most popular subreddits.  \n\n* Drastic measures are always looked upon as something that is a last resort. I don't see that to be the case. I think that if we, as a community, all stood together to eliminate the allowance of such trolls, mock accounts, novelty accounts, etc., we could finally move past all that nonsense that has seemed to take over reddit.   \n\n* Everyday that we stand by and do nothing, is another day that is wasted. I think this is a legit concern for /r/TheoryOfReddit, and I have spent a lot of time debating whether of not to post my concerns here. However, I feel that this is the best community to help address this matter, and help me/us/reddit come up with bigger and better solutions! I have eliminated some of the text to cut down on some of the read time, but feel free to add anything to this down below in the comments.   \n\n---  \nThanks for reading, and I look forward to hearing some of your comments/suggestions/solutions to better improve the quality of a community that we all hold so dear, www.reddit.com: -The Front Page of the Internet.",

        "text": "Hello Everyone! This is a REPOST.\n\nA couple months ago I posted a link for a survey that I am doing for my graduate work and got great responses from you guys! I am still in the process of collecting data so I am seeing if there are any others who are interested in participating in my study on rule breaking on the internet.\n\n\n I am a sociology graduate student and I am currently recruiting participants for a research study from the University of Western Ontario in Canada. The project is called Rule Perspectives and Rule Breaking Among Active Internet Users and it looks at moral acceptability and behavioural tendencies to engage in certain actions on the internet.\n\n\nI think that this study promotes interesting sociological discussion on the social impacts of technology on people's thoughts and behaviours. Do you guys think that the internet has the ability to change how you act and feel? Do you think that you may do things online that you would never do offline? Do you think there is such thing as an online 'self' (Mead, Cooley, Higgins, Goffman, Rogers, Baumeister). What would be the social implications for interpersonal interactions in cyberspace, cyber-crime, or cyber-bullying? These are some questions that I am investigating for this study. We can discuss some of these things in this thread and the study may help shed more light into such questions. I can definitely share the results of this study next year when I am finished writing the dissertation. Seeing as this is r/TheoryOfReddit, do you also think that Reddit would lead to different changes than just participation in general cyberspace?\n\n\nOk, so this is an academic survey that takes about 20-25 minutes to complete, but hopefully it is interesting enough to keep you engaged throughout. Eligible participants are those who are over 18 years of age. Please feel free to send the link to anyone who might interested or even post it on social media.\n\n\nHere is the link: https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/rulebreakinguwo\n\n\nThanks so much you beautiful people and lets talk about the sociology of the internet and Reddit!\n",

I asked the officers what they were doing here, and they asked \"does *my name* live here? are you *my name*?\" I said yes, I was. They said that they got a call about someone threatening to kill themselves. I was pretty out of it, tired and a bit hungover, and asked them how they got their information. They told me that it was posted on a message board, and that \"someone\" called in to check on me.\n\nThe post I made was very brief and contained absolutely no information about myself, where I lived, my name etc...\n\nI've been thinking about this all day and the only conclusion that I can come to is that the admins took it upon themselves to get my IP, address, info etc and had an officer sent out. \n\nWhat baffles me again is that the officer knew my name and asked for me. 3 people live here and my ISP isn't even in my name.\n",

I only checked the most popular cases where the title begins with the word \"So\" + a space or \"So\" + a comma; the other cases are extremely trivial and rarely appeared during my research.

Good on you. Don’t trust anything on the internet from strangers, and always ask for sources. \n\nThis was simply a stupid social experiment and a reminder that: \n\nA) there's always more than one story to a single picture;\n\nB) the internet, including reddit, is full of manipulative liars;\n\nC) upvotes ≠ truth;\n\nD) people are easily fooled when something confirms a preconceived narrative they’ve already created; and\n\nE) drama is usually more entertaining than fact, and thus easier to sell.\n\n\nIt’s simple to say, “F— you OP, I know all these things already!” and judging from several comments  in my fake thread, I would agree, many redditors *do* know these things already. If this is you, pat yourselves on the back (it’s worth more than the upvotes I already gave you). I was sorry to see most of you actually got downvoted though.\n\n\nBut unfortunately, it looks like the majority of people who got wrapped up in the drama instead of looking at facts could use a friendly reminder. \n\n\nBe aware of confirmation bias in every single aspect of daily life and, of course, that includes what you see on the internet. There is no escaping your own quailia. As human beings, each and every one of us are slaves, by way of genetics and environment, to our own personally unique five senses. No one is an exception to this. \n\n\nIf I can make an account and accumulate over 2000 karma in a few hours based on a very simple lie, consider for a moment how easy it is to game reddit. \n\n\nRedditors often say, *internet points are worthless,* probably since the inception of reddit ,and I believe that to be true. Karma points mean nothing, but they do sway people. The more karma something has, the more trustworthy it appears. \n\n\nBe mindful that the internet, reddit included, is chock full of of liars and shysters and they’re not as easily identifiable as you think. Most of them come here looking to gain something more valuable from reddit than simply karma, and they’re far better at getting what they want than I am because they’ve devoted entire careers to it.\n\n\nI sold a stupid narrative in exchange for worthless karma, but don’t trust your instincts to know when you are subtly being sold something much larger—be it an ideology or material good—by parties with something bigger to gain. The higher the stakes, the harder they will work at it, and the more people they’ll employ to reach their goals. Think how much more believable my lie would have been if I had a second account backing up my lie.\n\n\nMarketers have known the power of social news for years. [Here’s an article from 2007 on how to successfully market to social news sites.](http://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/1368/10-Secrets-to-Marketing-with-Social-News-Sites-Digg-Reddit-StumbleUpon-and-more.aspx) How many marketing agencies read that same article 8 years ago and had a team on their staff set up reddit accounts? I know a company I worked for did.\n\n\nThat was almost a decade ago. Now think how much that style of marketing has grown since then.  People have made careers figuring out the best ways to manipulate social news sites.\n\n\nCorporations, politicians, lobbyists, and entire teams of marketers, PR agencies, and think-tanks are exceedingly aware of how much sway a single positive post on reddit or any other social news sites (even 4chan) can have on their fortune, and have know this for a long time now. [Reddit is not a hidden site](http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/reddit.com) where only the chosen have been initiated. \n\n \nTo think people with something real to gain (be it money or power) don’t have entire teams devoted to selling their product and ideology on reddit would be foolish. In it’s most obvious form, all you need to do is look at r/IAmA to see what a gigantic sales tool reddit has become. As someone who has got a relatively decent look at the inside of the internet marketing world, be sure to know that there are hundreds (if not thousands) of accounts set up simply to ask the right questions and give the right answers that lead people to desired conclusions. These accounts are also encouraged to browse and use reddit in their personal time as well making them harder identify as someone with nefarious motives. Someone who posts in r/politics, r/worldnews, r/firearms, r/music, r/technology, r/mildlyinfuriating, r/justiceporn, and r/gaming will look far more legit than just a single account spamming r/worldnews. \n\n\nAnyway, that’s about all I have to say on that for now. If it wasn’t educational for you, I hope it was at least entertaining.\n\n\nTLDR; don’t trust everything you read. Don’t be so quick with your pitchforks. Be aware of confirmation bias and that you will see what you want to see. Demand **legitimate** sources on even the most plausible stories (neither a photo nor a fancy infographic qualifies as a legitimate source). Just because something has a lot of upvotes doesn’t make it true. There are baddies out there not just trying to trick you into giving them your upvotes, but trying to win your hearts and minds as well. In all likelihood, it’s working because they’re extremely skilled at what they do.\n\n\nGood luck, Redditors.\n\n\n\nSincerely, u/saydrah",

Many people will use transition words like \"So,\" \"Then,\" or \"Yeah, but,\" and then pose their post as a response from the person originally being addressed.\n\nI can always chalk it up to \"easier to get karma,\" but is that what is really rewarded?  Forum behavior does not seem to have this issue, but is that because Reddit removes individual differentiation by only presenting usernames?",

        "text": "Got the idea for this thread a couple of hours ago. Basically, memes go through 5 stages of life before they're reborn. This cycle may or may not continue until the end of time.\n\n----\n\n* Step One: The meme is born, usually on reddit or 4chan. It's pretty funny to start with.   \n\n* Step Two: The meme starts to spread, and more creative uses are developed as it becomes more well-known. This is typically the zenith of the meme's life, and it is when the meme is at its funniest.\n\n* Step Three: Upon seeing that the meme gets a lot of positive attention, people start to spam it whenever possible, causing it to grate on the nerves of many. People start to get sick of the meme, and will sometimes react negatively to it being posted.\n\n* Step Four: This stage usually runs parallel to step 3. The meme spreads to mainstream social media (Facebook, YouTube, etc.) and will sometimes start to pop up in real life conversation. This is usually the stage when the meme's value is capitalised upon by corporations (/r/fellowkids, Grumpy Cat movie). At this stage, the original source of the meme (often reddit or 4chan) has moved on, and considers the meme to be dead, as it has become mainstream. The meme may remain \"dead\" for an extended period of time.\n\n* Step Five: Someone revives the meme by using it ironically, be it in a post or comment, on the original source website. This reminds people of how funny the meme was when it was used properly, and also introduces a whole new generation to the meme. The cycle now begins anew.\n\n--------------------\n\nI don't know how accurate this is, but I think I've come pretty close, especially looking at some of the memes that are popular today and comparing them with some more old-school memes.\n\nExamples:\n\n* Rekt (and **#rekt**, Shrekt, Tyrannosaurus Rekt, etc.) -- Stage 3/4\n\n* Ayy lmao -- Stage 2/3\n\n* Gnome Child -- Stage 2/3\n\n* \"Dank meme!\" (and \"Nice meme!\", niceme.me, etc.) -- Stage 2\n\n* Top kek (and tippest of keks, top kekkington, kekistan, etc.) -- Stage 2/3\n\n* Rage comics -- Stage 4/5\n\n* OP's mom -- Stage 5/1. This one is fascinating, as \"Your mom\" jokes have been around since the dawn of time, before dying a couple of years ago when they entered the mainstream. A couple of months ago it started to be used ironically, particularly on the default/larger subreddits, and now it has re-entered common use.\n\n* U fkn wot m8 (and I will hook u in the gabber, etc.) -- Stage 3\n\n-------\n\nSorry if this doesn't belong here, I just thought it'd be something interesting to discuss and analyse. I think I'm mostly accurate, although I'm a little unsure on the exact circumstances of a meme's transition from death into undeath (between step 5 and step 1), but I think ironic use definitely plays a contributing factor.",
