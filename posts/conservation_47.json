        "text": "Conservation is a very important aspect in preserving the natural environments and wildlife in our world, right? But why exactly do we need to take such precautionary measures to preserve these aspects of the Earth if they should already be protected? Many would say that climate change and human activity are the primary factors that contribute to the need to protect these things. For example, deforestation is a huge issue that is impacting both the climate by releasing more carbon into the atmosphere, as well as destroying the habitats of many wildlife species. The destruction of forests all over the Earth is resulting in the loss of habitat for wildlife that the forests provide. This wildlife is becoming threatened and endangered from the threat of deforestation, and it also increases the susceptibility to fires, which would further damage the homes of wildlife species. Since forests act as a carbon sink (soaking up carbon dioxide instead of having it sitting in the atmosphere), cutting these trees down will only increase the rate of climate change - which in turn, would result in more endangerment to wildlife species in other environments not including forests. Issues like this seem to be chain reactions, but the real questions are thinking about what we can do to stop destructive human activity such as deforestation. Aside from using recycled products, are there other ways that we can help save our forests and environments that are being afflicted due to climate change and human activity? It takes everyone being aware of these problems and acting upon them to help make a large difference, so what resources are available to bring more attention to this and promote steps to help protect our forests and wildlife?

Organizations such as Rainforest Trust and Nature Conservancy purchase land and transition ownership eventually to government institutions. \n\nTaken directly from: https://www.rainforesttrust.org/about/faqs/\n\n\"While Rainforest Trust raises the necessary funds to protect real acres in real places, neither Rainforest Trust nor our donors own them. The acres are ultimately bought and preserved as nature reserves by Rainforest Trust’s local conservation partners.\n\nA national park or reserve given protected status by a foreign government may require active protection by non-governmental organizations, but it is not owned by the NGOs; it belongs to the government.\"\n\nI have somewhat of an issue with the fact that the land purchased is put in the hands of governments that are often complicit with the destruction of Nature. Considering this, are there any mechanisms in place by which the land purchased is held from the whims of the current political constructs? Somewhat concerned because I'm sure if these lands were put to other uses the response would be after the fact and  quite disproportionate to the deed. \n\nFor those of you who have not done already:   https://www.rainforesttrust.org/news/rainforest-trust-joins-amazon-smile/",

        "text": "I would like to apologise up front for my wording or this. Putting thoughts into text has always been an issue for me. So onto the question: Is conservation important? And why is it or isn't it? A question was posed to us in a geography class. \"Why save the rhinos? Why bother? We should be worried more about ourselves surely? We should fight for ourselves shouldn't we?\" He continued to question the importance of conservation of nature. His reasons being that, for example, the rhino doesn't play a huge role in the ecosystem. This is probably true, the rhino going extinct would not have too many adverse effects apart from those on the rhino population of course. He was also insistent that continuing the human race it far more important and that conservation of the human race more crucial. So he argues if we want to stop greenhouse emissions it should be to save humans. I don't see why we would disagree with that. But then surely conserving nature would then help in conserving the human race would it not? Should the lone polar bear on melting ice not only worry us because it is fluffy and cute and dying but also because of the ramifications on the human race. It almost seems like a self defeating argument. We shouldn't conserve nature... But we should. So why should we conserve the natural habitats of our planet and why should we make an effort to save dying species(particularly from events that don't affect us e.g rhinos)?",
