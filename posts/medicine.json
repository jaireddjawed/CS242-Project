While much of a physician\u2019s training occurs in medical school and residency, doctors must stay current with scientific developments and innovation.\" So without non-competes, hospitals won't care if their doctors are up to date?

I get that a lot of people had unrealistic expectations of medicine, often thinking it's way more exciting and dramatic than it is really. But really, I feel like even if you know it's not often exciting, there's a lot of paperwork and bla bla, it's still one of the most beautiful careers there is. You are helping people, even if it is boring paperwork. Even if they're angry at you and it's often a thankless job. Even if you're just stabilizing a patient that has so many issues that they will inevitably come back to the hospital in a few weeks. I get that it can be frustrating, but all of this should be expected, imo before you commit to medicine you should read up a little on the subject, and still want to do that regardless. Sometimes I'm kind of confused as to why people get so disappointed about this specific aspect of medicine (it being more boring and paperwork oriented, very often not actually saving people). Having been to nursing school before, I remember how much paperwork it was, but somehow I still liked it. I didn't expect drama and movie-like scenarios, I just enjoyed reminding myself each time that what I was doing was helping people, no matter how boring it was sometimes. Also, there was the occasional exciting save too so there's that.\n\nAbout midlevel issues, litigation anxiety etc., I feel like these are obviously important issues, but every job must have its problems, no? I feel like people always think the grass is greener elsewhere.\n\nOf course, there are some issues that I feel are way more significant as there is sometimes no way around them, like the culture of overworking, the social pressure, the working conditions, which I think shouldn't be part of medicine in an ideal world.\n\nAt the end of the day though, a job is a job, it's not meant to be as exciting or relaxing as your hobbies and stuff like that, it's kind of to be expected that it's hard work and not that exciting, but the fact remains that most of the things we do are to help people in a way, even if it's boring.\n\nFor those who have been there, what do you think ?

Imagine if your 401k doubled every 3.4 months. It\u2019s difficult for the human brain to comprehend this type of exponential growth. \n\nWhat we\u2019re seeing right now with Chat GPT is like the early days of computers that still used punched out pieces of paper to run calculations. Simply put its child play. \n\nMy hot take: I think in the next 1-2 years we\u2019ll start seeing AI integrated in our EHR. It\u2019s already being used in research but I think we\u2019ll see it on the clinical side very soon. Initially it will be for small things, subtle and probably welcomed to help with cognitive load and complex patients. Epic pop-ups will actually start being helpful. It will gradually become a more and more integral part of medicine and those with less experience and training will benefit the most. \n\nI think in 10 years or less it will be everywhere and determine treatment\/ management plans for most patients. Risk calculators based on millions of data points will determine disposition, which floor the patient needs, medications etc. \n\nEventually, in 10-15 years I think AI will impact medicine as a career. Those with less training and experience will just need to lean on AI and be \u201cgood enough\u201d to replace most physicians. This will be welcomed by insurance companies and hospital systems. Non-procedure specialties will be hit the hardest initially. Eventually in 25+ years we will all be replaced by a robot\/nurse\/AI hybrid.\n\nNot trying to stir up fear and controversy but it\u2019s an interesting topic that we need to start thinking about.

[This](https:\/\/www.thelancet.com\/journals\/lancet\/article\/PIIS0140-6736\\(23\\)00434-8\/fulltext) is the lead editorial in the March edition of The Lancet. What is the purpose of this in a journal about medicine? Not just a journal, but arguably The journal.\n\nI understand that medicine doesn't exist in a vacuum from society. Social determinants of health have a massive impact on our patients and our ability to care for them. Public policy, both surrounding health care and more generally, has relevance to our jobs. But they don't even mention anywhere how this would impact public health around the world. There are a few sentences vaguely mentioning not addressing the World Bank's health-related projects, but they don't actually go into any detail regarding how the current leadership is negatively impacting public health globally, beyond it being neocolonial.\n\nThis seems like a minor gripe, a single 5 paragraph editorial in one journal is not corrupting medicine. I get that. But this feels straight up political to me. The authors clearly want to exert influence in this sector, and to me they haven't justified why this will benefit patients and public health. Over the last 3 years in particular we've had a crisis of faith in institutions, medicine and public health being amongst the most affected. The politicization of COVID and other issues has led to mistrust and outright dismissal of evidence-based medical guidance by large swathes of people. I simply don't think that continuing to throw ourselves in the mud of politics will help us get out of this mess, except when we are dealing with public policy issues that have a clear and demonstrable impact on our patients and our ability to care for them. \n\nBut hey, I'm open to criticism.","upvote_ratio":0.84,"created_utc":1677849348.0},{"title":"Current practices in weight loss medication prescribing","author":"HereForTheFreeShasta","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/medicine\/comments\/11h2not\/current_practices_in_weight_loss_medication\/","text":"With prescribing criteria,  recommendations, and pricing changing frequently, how have you been approaching the weight loss medication conversation with patients recently?","upvote_ratio":0.89,"created_utc":1677855091.0},{"title":"What are the best ways to treat hospital delirium?","author":"zeatherz","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/medicine\/comments\/11gstuu\/what_are_the_best_ways_to_treat_hospital_delirium\/","text":"I know all the ways to prevent it- encourage out of bed activity, allow uninterrupted rest, maintain day\/night rhythm, lights on and curtain open during the day, lights off at night, avoid deleriogenic meds, etc.\n\nUnfortunately for many reasons those frequently don\u2019t happen. Sometimes patients refuse, sometimes they need frequent monitoring\/meds, sometimes orders don\u2019t get updated to address improved status (changing q 4 vitals to q8 for example), sometimes policy and workflow cause problems (0400 labs). \n\nSo delirium happens. Do we have any good ways to actually treat it? Often the prevention steps don\u2019t work because the patient becomes so agitated and confused that they\u2019re a risk to self or staff. They often get restrained or sedated to protect themselves\/be able to continue medical treatment- but that of course worsens their delirium. 1:1 sitters, even the good ones, often don\u2019t actually help to calm the patient or get them to sleep. Telling the patient \u201cit\u2019s midnight, time to sleep\u201d or \u201cit\u2019s 7 am, let\u2019s get up for breakfast\u201d rarely actually gets them back to a regular sleep schedule in my experience.\n\nHonestly I\u2019ve not seen much at all work other than family presence (though sometimes they make it worse too by getting so upset at seeing their delirious loved one).

Right out of residency I signed a two-year contract with a hospital, and as part of the compensation package I received a $40,000 signing bonus (as a check, before I ever worked a single shift) and a total of $60,000 in loan repayment (structured as two separate $30k repayments directly to the loan servicer, once at my one-year anniversary and another at my two-year anniversary).\n\nThis all seemed great, I am certainly making much more money as an attending than I ever made in residency. The taxes are hefty, but I managed to adjust my withholding so it wasn't too big of a shock when tax time came each year.\n\nThis year, however, my W2 showed my taxable wages as $100k higher than expected. When I reached out to payroll, they said that this represents the signing bonus as well as my loan repayment. I checked my agreement that I signed (with great excitement, as a new grad!) and lo and behold, it says that these amounts are taxable, AND that these taxes will all be due during the 2022 tax year.\n\nMy question for you is: has anyone had a similar situation? I punched my numbers into TurboTax and was blown away when my amount due skyrocketed from \\~$1,000 to >$30,000 (I know, I need a tax person!). I acknowledge that we as physicians make a good living, but I don't know many people that just have $30k sitting around to give to the government. I also acknowledge that technically I agreed to this when I signed the agreement, but it seems like a bad way to provide bonuses and loan repayment if a large lump sum will suddenly become taxable all at once. Obviously, I'm not a tax person, but a cursory search seems to indicate that employers should withhold taxes from both signing bonuses and loan repayments. Not sure if there's much that can be done at this point, but I'm seriously at a loss and have been quite stressed about how I'm going to come up with the money.\n\nI very much appreciate any insight into this.

When the nurses were cutting off his clothes, his entire body was covered in infectious lesions & body lice, and his feet were both infected, bloody, and necrotic - also covered in insects. The smell was absolutely putrid. We ended up having to intubate this man as he could not protect his own airway. I will never forget seeing the pink foamy mixture of blood and mucus shoot out of his mouth throughout the entire series of compressions. The nurses & other personnel performing CPR had body lice crawling all over their clothes and in their hair. We tried to rewarm the man with IV fluids and the bear hugger, and ultimately ended up using ECMO in the trauma bay. After some time, we were able to warm him enough to achieve ROSC and then he was then transferred to the ICU, where he was basically determined to be braindead with a pulse. He stayed in the ICU for weeks and weeks until I imagine he was then transferred out to some long-term care facility.

But the role of masks in medicine has changed so drastically in the last 3 years that it warrants conversation.\n\n\nI used to like (or rather have no strong feelings or opinion towards) personal protective equipment. Masks were a component of a reasonable set of guidelines in the context of surgery and isolation precautions. Surgical masks limited the likeliest transmissible pathogens in the perioperative setting without being overly cumbersome. When dealing with known cases of airborne disease, a higher degree of protection was implemented, i.e. N95s. In both situations, neither is, nor was intended to be, a perfect barrier to disease transmission (thus the \u201c95\u201d part). A degree of risk was permissible and that degree changed based on the situation.\n\n\nNow? I don\u2019t even know how to describe what\u2019s going on. Masks havre morphed into a job requirement, another drink not to be left at the nurse\u2019s station, and frankly a barrier to our humanity. I depend on my coworkers with lives at stake and *I don\u2019t even know what they look like.* Comparisons to restrictive religious garb would not be unwarranted.\n\n\nMasks used to be science. Now there\u2019s politics, money, and fear mixed in. It\u2019s a mess.

You want to protect your patients. Me too! Life is not an inherently risk-free endeavor. Ad absurdum you could live your life in a bunny suit. The effects of universal surgical masking policy in healthcare settings on pathogenicity and overall outcomes will be hard to tease out and will take time to determine.\n\n\nBut this mask-cop, chin-strap, left-right-blue-red nonsense is just too much for me to handle.

This has led to an insurance cartel that engages in things that are illegal in every other industry.  \n\nThis has (supposedly) changed. \n\nThe McCarran\u2013Ferguson Act was something that the public learned about during the PP ACA debate, [and were occasionally surprised to learn that health insurance is exempt from anti-trust legislation.](https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20091031063528\/http:\/\/www.examiner.net\/news\/x1914248650\/Health-insurance-companies-exempt-from-anti-trust-laws)\n\n## H.R.1418 \u2014 116th Congress\n\n[Congress has amended the McCarran\u2013Ferguson Act to make it clear that health insurance is not exempt from anti-trust legislation](https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/116\/plaws\/publ327\/PLAW-116publ327.pdf). This is important to know, federal anti-trust law applies to health insurance. \n\n[Here was the debate in the house.](https:\/\/files.catbox.moe\/lz83t0.mp4) \n\nSigned into law in January 2021. Maybe there was some other, more captivating news during that time that made people (myself included) not see this.\n\nWho knows if this will actually change anything.\n\n\n---\n\n[*H.R.4626 - Health Insurance Industry Fair Competition Act*](https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/bill\/111th-congress\/house-bill\/4626\/text) was an attempt to do this during the ACA. The house passed it 406 - 19 on February 24, 2010. The ACA was signed into law March 23, 2010. \n\nIt never made it into the ACA. \n\n*It was stripped out in the senate. At the behest of a former insurance executive.* You will see more below. \n\nIt was reintroduced in 2017 but never made it anywhere. \n\n\n---\n\nhttps:\/\/www.c-span.org\/video\/?476001-1\/house-session\n\nHere is what rep DeFazio said in the house. The transcript from CSPAN is not 100% correct, but it gets the point across. I noted where I changed things to more accurately reflect what was said in Italics.\n\nHis point on geographic redlining is well taken. Deeply seated grievances are being created right now that are not talked about. There are all sorts of justifications that could be used to say it's not necessarily a bad thing. Think about it for a minute, think of all the implications.  \n\nIt's not a surprise people do not trust healthcare, or medicine in general, if they view it as deeming them unworthy because of where they wake up and go to bed. People come to the beliefs they hold for a reason.\n\n\n>I thank the gentlelady. This bill, h.r. 1418, has 51 co-sponsors in the house, 26 democrats, 25 republicans. It's endorsed by 23 national organizations, including consumer reports, who estimates it will save consumers billions of dollars a year in health insurance costs. Other consumer rights groups, american dental association, hospital association, and more. There are only two for-profit industries in america who have an exemption from antitrust law. One is professional baseball dating from the 1920's. And the other is the vital area of health insurance, dating to the 1940's. This amendment -- this bill will take away that exemption. What's that mean? Right now, insurance companies can and do get together and collude.\n\n>Before covid, they'd go to some fancy resorts, get together and say, how about you stay out of north dakota, we'll stay out of south dakota. You stay out of oregon. You stay out of washington. You divide up the pie. You decide where you're selling. We'll decide where we're selling. ***Oh, and by the way, here's the things we don't want to cover. Here are the people we want to redline and exclude. That's legal, that's all legal!*** What does it do? It drives up the cost and the availability is diminished for americans. And now here we are midst covid. And the estimates are that five million people have lost their insurance during covid. Five million people. Yet, last year, the health insurance industry made an eye-popping $33 billion in profits. This year, the reports are they're doing even better with more and more people uninsured. How are they doing that? Well, they're jacking up co-pays. They're jacking up deductibles. They're excluding all sorts of treatments from coverage. And it's all legal and they can all get together and say, hey, if you won't cover this, we won't cover it. That way you won't lose customers. We won't lose customers. What a sweet deal. What a sweet deal. One in four americans hesitated to go to the doctor. Who was insured. People who were insured. Or to fill a prescription. Get needed treatment because of the extraordinary co-pays and high deductibles. So that's why people are paying $2,000, $3,000, $4,000 before they can get coverage on these so-called policies. What's this about? It's about greed. And it's time to end. \n\n>This is a vital service for the american people. You know, this bill was part of the original affordable care act in the house. My provision. It was stripped out in the senate. At the behest of a former insurance executive. Good old senate. So it didn't get into the final version of the a.c.a. They took out a lot of good things too. The house bill was way preferable with exchanges, not for profits, etc. In any case, it was stripped out. The house held another vote after the passage of the affordable care act in 2010. Tom pair yellow, then representative from virginia, offered up my bill on the floor, and it passed by 406-19. What kind of bills pass 409-19? Then my co-lead on the bill, representative gosar, he introduced the bill in 2017, and it passed 416-7. In the most bitterly partisan atmosphere in congress since post-civil war, 416-7. It's time to get this done. Finally, we're seeing some action in the senate. Senator leahy has introduced a bill. Chair of the judiciary committee. Of course -- I mean -- sorry, ranking member. And senator daines. So three democrats, three republicans on the bill. Hopefully, you know, the senate will see the wisdom in helping americans afford health insurance. Lowering their deductibles. Lowering their co-pays. Lowering their exclusions on prescription drugs. You know, even under medicare part d, they are always jacking people around. They say, oh, sorry, you can't have that medication anymore. We just took it off the list last week. They can do it anytime they want, and they can talk to the other insurers and say, hey, we're taking that drug off our list. Will you take it off your list? We don't want people to switch to your plan. That is legal. This will be a tremendous service to the american people. If at any time in history. But particularly now in times of covid and crisis.

With that I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n---\n\nSomeone has to actually enforce it for the law to be useful. \n\nWhat do you think?","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1677345513.0},{"title":"Medical Record Legality","author":"InflationRemote6905","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/medicine\/comments\/11bswyu\/medical_record_legality\/","text":"I work as staff at a private practice that charges per visit, such as to follow up and review reports.

The research showed that this testing could be done cheaply and easily, without disturbing passengers or airport operations.*\n\nA new study conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and biotech company Ginkgo Bioworks has shown that aircraft wastewater surveillance can be a useful and low-resource approach to monitoring SARS-CoV-2 variants. The study found that the testing was easy and could be done cheaply, only adding about three extra minutes to aircraft maintenance times at airports. The authors of the study say that this approach could provide a complementary early warning system for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 variants and other pathogens of public health concern.\n\n## The Study\n\nThe study was conducted in collaboration with Ginkgo Bioworks and tested wastewater samples from 80 international flights into New York City's John F. Kennedy International Airport between August 1 and September 9, 2022. All flights originated from the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and France. The researchers collected and tested 65 airborne sewage samples, and 81 percent of the samples tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. The rate of positive samples was the same among the three countries. The researchers were also able to get 27 genome sequences from 25 of the samples. All of the genomes revealed omicron sublineages, mostly BA.5 as well as BA.4.6 and BA.2.75.\n\n## The Feasibility\n\nThe study demonstrated the feasibility of aircraft wastewater surveillance as a low-resource approach compared with individual testing to monitor SARS-CoV-2 variants without direct traveler involvement or disruption to airport operations. According to the authors, the testing only added about three extra minutes to aircraft maintenance times at airports and didn't require hassling passengers with nose swabs or other sampling methods. The authors concluded that the testing could be easily scaled up as needed as the world largely abandons other SARS-CoV-2 testing and monitoring strategies.\n\n## The Importance\n\nThe study adds to other evidence that airport and aircraft wastewater surveillance can play a role in monitoring the spread of pathogens, such as SARS-CoV-2. This method has already been used in various places around the country for monitoring early surges of COVID-19 as well as tracking the spread of polio in New York. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, viral shedding in feces can begin very early in an infection, potentially before a person has symptoms.\n\n## Limitations\n\nWhile the study has shown the effectiveness of aircraft wastewater surveillance, there are limitations to this method. It will be mostly helpful for longer flights, where people are more likely to use the lavatory. Additionally, it's unclear if all airlines will agree to the sampling. Lastly, because international travelers can have various connecting flights before arriving in the US, it might not be possible to track the origin of variants that arrive in the US.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe study conducted by the CDC and Ginkgo Bioworks has demonstrated that aircraft wastewater surveillance can be an effective and low-resource approach to monitoring SARS-CoV-2 variants. The authors say that this approach could provide a complementary early warning system for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 variants and other pathogens of public health concern.","upvote_ratio":0.94,"created_utc":1677277058.0},{"title":"Hospital lobby urges FTC to withdraw or add healthcare exceptions to sweeping noncompete ban","author":"nishbot","url":"https:\/\/www.fiercehealthcare.com\/providers\/hospital-lobby-urges-ftc-withdraw-or-add-healthcare-exceptions-non-compete-proposal","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1677225702.0},{"title":"Pharmacist here venting about a call with a surgeon.","author":"GiveMe1OfThemBigOnes","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/medicine\/comments\/11alt4g\/pharmacist_here_venting_about_a_call_with_a\/","text":"For background, I am a central hospital pharmacist. I verify\/edit\/enter roughly 600-800 orders per an 8 hour shift for a hospital that has an average census of 350. We used MediTech.\n\nI was processing orders entered by a colorectal surgeon (home med continuations), one of which was lisinopril. The patient's potassium from that morning was 5.7, and they also had IVFs running with potassium. So, I called the surgeon to see if the IVF could be changed\/stopped and to hold the lisinopril.\n\nI thought it was going to be a straightforward call. Immediately he says that he has already taken care of the IVF and that I must have been taking too many coffee breaks and my computer is \"slow\" for not recognizing it. I am confused because the IVF order is still very much active and I do not see any edits on it. There is a little bit of a lag between order entry and \"pharmacy land\" so I assume he may have just edited the order a few seconds ago, and I needed to refresh. I do so, and nothing has changed. He goes on to say that he has ordered it to be capped\/locked, so that is when I leave the pharmacy processing side and go to the order entry side and can see that he has typed a nursing communication to lock the IVF about 20 mins prior, but had not actually discontinued the order. I see this and understand now what he meant, and offered to discontinue the IVF for him to which he replies no, I can't do that because he has already done so since locking it means it is discontinued. Then as if I am a child, he implies that because I am only a central pharmacist that never leaves the pharmacy, I must not understand this. I didn't even know what to say. I shouldn't have pushed it further, but I still technically needed an order to d\/c it, so then I approach it a different way and ask the hypothetical that *if* it is not already stopped, could I D\/C it, in which he finally agrees.\n\nOk, so the IVF is gone, but now the lisinopril. I ask to hold the lisinopril, in which he replies \"for what?\" He declines my recommendation and says the patient's scr \"is fine\" and to start the lisinopril.\n\nHe then continues on and says my computer is \"slow\" again, and then asked if I worked the upcoming weekend, in which I replied yes, and he responded saying I shouldn't come back to work until my computer was fixed\/faster (wtf). I honestly can not tell if this man is joking or maybe just awkward. I generally avoid confrontation, so I just made a lighthearted comment and said \"haha, I'd love to be off\" but really I was dying inside and wanted to just get off the phone.\n\nI realize some of this is due to MediTech just being a terrible EMR, but seriously, I could not believe his comments and I just wanted to vent and gain some perspective from you guys.

Not every one will be able to get an orthopedic surgery residency in San Diego, but even the last place US medical grad can find a FP or Psych in somewhere rural and expect to be a full attending at the end of the residency.\n\nThe biggest bottleneck on the road to being a \"doctor\" is med school.  57% the applicants don't get in.  After that there are more residency spots than US medical graduates\n\nAfter med school, your post-graduate years up until completely of post-graduate training are often labeled as PGY1, PGY2 etc.  Internship, in general is usually just your first year of residency.  Internship is generally not a separate process or a separate application.  There are some exceptions such as transitional years or prelim years, but those are the exceptions.\n\nOften (particularly with internal medicine and general surgery) one will proceed with additional training after residency this is called fellowship.  For example, after 3 years of internal medicine residency I may choose subspecialty training.  These positions may or may not be competitive.  Cardiology and GI are competitive while ID and nephrology are not.  Basically any warm body can get an ID\/nephro position.  However, cards\/GI are not guaranteed\n\nWhat happens if you don't match into cards or GI?  You can try again the following year.  Maybe try again twice.  I've seen people match on their second or third try, but obviously your chances go down after each try.  that being said, once you're in, your set.  The fellowships have a well defined end point.  Once you're in your nearly guaranteed to become an attending.\n\nWhat happens if you don't match into cards or GI ever?  Well, then you are \"just\" an IM attending.  But you're an attending.  You can be a hospitalists (~350K\/year last time I checked with 7 on\/7off) or run your own clinic.  Or maybe even give ID, nephro, palliative a shot etc.  But no mistake about it you can work full time with all the glory and pain of being an attending after IM residency.\n\n----- \n\nIn the UK, it seems like you finish your MBBS and then you have 2 foundation years, which I guess act as like a general IM residency or general surgery residency.\n\nAfter your foundation years, then who knows?

Although the initial response was led by a sense of urgency and crisis management, the State Surgeon General believes it is critical that as public health professionals, responses are adapted to the present to chart a future guided by data.\n\nThe State Surgeon General is notifying the health care sector and public of a substantial increase in Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) reports from Florida after the COVID-19 vaccine rollout.\n\nOverall reports submitted to VAERS, Florida 2006\u20132022 - v2\nOverall reports submitted to VAERS, Florida 2006\u20132022\nIn Florida alone, there was a 1,700% increase in VAERS reports after the release of the COVID-19 vaccine, compared to an increase of 400% in overall vaccine administration for the same time period (Figure 1). \n\nThe reporting of life-threatening conditions increased over 4,400%. This is a novel increase and was not seen during the 2009 H1N1 vaccination campaign. There is a need for additional unbiased research to better understand the COVID-19 vaccines' short- and long-term effects. \n\nThe findings in Florida are consistent with various studies that continue to uncover such risks. To further evaluate this, the Surgeon General wrote a letter to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) illustrating the risk factors associated with the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines and emphasizing the need for additional transparency.\n\nAccording to a study, Fraiman J et al, Vaccine. 2022, mRNA COVID-19 vaccines were associated with an excess risk of serious adverse events, including coagulation disorders, acute cardiac injuries, Bell\u2019s palsy, and encephalitis. This risk was 1 in 550 individuals, which is much higher than other vaccines.\n\nA second study, Sun CLF et al, Sci Rep. 2022, found increased acute cardiac arrests and other acute cardiac events following mRNA COVID-19 vaccination.\n\nAdditionally, Dag Berild J et al, JAMA Netw Open. 2022, assessed the risk of thromboembolic and thrombocytopenic events related to COVID-19 vaccines and found preliminary evidence of increased risk of both coronary disease and cardiovascular disease.\n\nWhile the CDC has identified safety signals for stroke among individuals 65 and older following the bivalent booster administration, there is a need for additional assessments and research regarding safety of all mRNA COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nTo support transparency, the State of Florida reminds health care providers to accurately communicate the risks and benefits of all clinical interventions to their patients, including those associated with the COVID-19 vaccine as additional risks continue to be identified and disclosed to the public.\n\nThe State of Florida remains dedicated to protecting communities from the risks of COVID-19 and other public health concerns, specifically by promoting the importance of treatment and promoting prevention through healthy habits. We encourage our health care partners and providers to do the same.","upvote_ratio":0.93,"created_utc":1676691335.0},{"title":"Doctors At 2 Allina Health Campuses Seek Union Representation","author":"Ejdubs","url":"https:\/\/patch.com\/minnesota\/maplegrove\/doctors-2-allina-health-campuses-seek-union-representation?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=share","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1676637947.0},{"title":"UCMC doctor accused of conducting nonconsensual testicle ultrasounds on patients in bedroom of his home","author":"Dibs_on_Mario","url":"https:\/\/www.wcpo.com\/news\/local-news\/hamilton-county\/cincinnati\/ucmc-doctor-accused-of-conducting-nonconsensual-testicle-ultrasounds-on-patients-in-bedroom-of-his-home","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1676643379.0},{"title":"FDA approves Pegcetacoplan as the first treatment for AMD with Geographic Atrophy, a leading cause of irreversible age-related blindness","author":"StoicOptom","url":"https:\/\/www.biopharmadive.com\/news\/apellis-fda-approval-syfovre-geographic-atrophy\/643111\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1676676204.0},{"title":"The Fight for the Soul of American Medicine","author":"anriarer","url":"https:\/\/www.thenation.com\/article\/society\/doctors-american-medicine-public-health\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.94,"created_utc":1676655591.0},{"title":"Partners in private practice taking advantage of associates?","author":"Shitty_UnidanX","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/medicine\/comments\/114ikf3\/partners_in_private_practice_taking_advantage_of\/","text":"I\u2019m in my first job after residency\/ fellowship training, and can\u2019t help but feel like I\u2019m getting taken advantage of in private practice (sports fellowship training).

My question to PCPs is, if you aren't already, will you start offering medical treatment for OUD? Two hypothetical scenarios to consider:\n\n1) A new patient establishing care mentions that they were recently discharged from the local hospital on Suboxone, and since then they've done well and haven't needed heroin. They ask if you're willing to refill it, and are more than happy to submit to a drug test to prove they've been \"clean.\"\n\n2) An established patient has been stable on Suboxone for years, prescribed by a substance use clinic that doesn't accept their insurance and still requires them to come in monthly, sometimes waiting for hours to be seen. They're starting a new job and ask if you can take over, which would save them a lot of time and money.\n\nDisclaimer: I have a strong bias regarding this subject but my intention is not to push my agenda.

I contacted my seniors and informed them of my decision to leave my current work and travel to work for the NHS. To be fair, almost all of them talked kindly to me and even encouraged me to do my best. I started applying for jobs at a somehow increasing rate and took the path seriously. I even booked my first MRCS in May in the UK as a statement of confidence to myself and my family.   \n\n\nThe first few days of my quitting were marvelous to say the least. I slept full 7 hours and was able to exercise and eat healthy home-made food. I even started fixing things around the house which needed my care -my family depends on me for such things-. I went out with my friends and even made some new ones. I want to clarify that I am not unemployed and currently work at a private hospital for individual shifts and instruct courses for the European Resuscitation Council.   \n\n\nOn the second week, I started feeling strange: First, there was a call from an assistant professor at my hospital who knew of my plans and asked to contact me. He called basically to tell me that I was a fool for leaving and that in no way I am going to receive the same training in managing face and hand trauma as I do in Egypt, and that my job in the UK would be basically clerking patients. He worked for 6 months in the UK. I thanked him for his advice, then ignored the call and his advice.   \n\n\nAs of the time of writing this post, I am still unable to land a job. I understand that it takes time, but it adds to the frustration.

Was hoping to get feedback on my current strategy for minimizing prior auths, denials of prior auths, etc, and also trying to help the residents navigate this mess.\n\n\\- When wanting to start an expensive meds (e.g., GLP-1 agonists, SGLT2i, insulin, etc). I have been googling \"X insurance company preferred med list\" and usually can find a PDF of meds listed as preferred, PA required, non-preferred, etc. Was thinking of printing these out once a year and keeping in a binder (so anyone in our clinic can use) or saving in a folder for my computer so I don't have to search everytime.\n\n\\- If a med is listed as \"prior auth needed\" then either prescribe it with plans to do a prior auth and forewarn the patient there will be a delay OR try to anticipate which med the insurance company wants me to try first and just do that one first. First example coming to mind is that I'm assuming I'm going to have to at least try oxybutynin and maybe another med before a Myrbetriq PA would get approved so might as well start with oxybutynin. Will need to try at least a couple of first line migraine meds before something like Nurtec. If they've already tried those things but their insurance is unaware then I guess I should prescribe what I think they need and then explain their past med trials in the PA.\n\n\\- Before I (recently) started doing the above, my strategy for patients who have enough health literacy is to ask them to call their insurance company and ask which med is covered within X class of medications. For example, which (if any) GLP-1 agonist is covered for obesity, and give them a list of choices to ask about. But then they can't really walk out with a script which means more follow-up work for us when they get back to us (if they ever do). OR I'd just pick a random one and tell them to let me know if it wasn't covered and we'd try a different one. This just felt too much like guesswork and inefficient.\n\n\\- My EMR is Epic. I've noticed a column within med ordering that says things like preferred, formulary, etc., but not sure how much stock to put in that and if it's referring to formulary for my health care system's pharmacy or for the patient's insurance.\n\n\\-When I worked inpatient, we routinely sent \"test scripts\" to our institutions pharmacy and they'd run it through their insurance with a cost of a 30$ supply. Haven't tried anything similar as outpatient.\n\nThank you for reading and would really appreciate feedback\/tips\/advice etc.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1675992829.0},{"title":"Question about controlled substances","author":"dannierose07","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/medicine\/comments\/10xw7pa\/question_about_controlled_substances\/","text":"Hi, Hopefully I'm allowed to post here even though I'm not on the clinical side of things. Anyway, I've been working as a medical administrative assistant for years and we recently hired a new MD. Apparently this MD has a policy where she requires her patients to have an appointment every single month if they take schedule IV controlled substances. She insists this is what the DEA requires. I have never heard of this in my life and patients are getting extremely mad because they're used to only coming in every 3 to 6 months. And honestly I cannot blame them because not only is it kind of annoying, but it's a financial hit having to pay a copay monthly or if you're out of pocket it gets very expensive. Especially considering a lot of these patients are students who probably don't have much income and just need their ADHD medicine so they can do their work. I've tried to look up the requirements, but honestly I haven't found any evidence to support the MD's claim.

Fortunately, throughout my life, I've rarely been sick, so I've never had much interaction with healthcare systems. I've had a few problems lately, and in the process I  have navigated the healthcare system of three different countries. I am now more sympathetic than ever towards patients who get lost navigating the system. My experience:\n\nUSA (home country): Referred by my PCP to an allergist. Booked appointment with allergist. Arrive to their office, and was told I don't have health insurance (impossible; not only do I know I have health insurance, but for more evidence, I used it when I visited my PCP who referred me here!). Later told that even if I did have insurance, I should have called the insurance company before my visit for them to approve my visit (I.e. my doctors referral was not enough). I left for school the following week so I had no time to reschedule\/figure things out with my insurance. \n\nPoland: Suspected UTI. Need urinalysis and urine culture. Referred to lab by PCP; go to lab, they do not do those test at this location, must go to their other location. Go to other lab across city, was told there is no bathroom for patients; I go to a nearby restaurant, pee in the cup they gave me, walk back and give them the cup and pay them. I check the results later: urine culture negative, no info about a urinalysis. Turns out the urinalysis was never conducted. Repeat process. \n\nFrance: Throat infection, made an appointment at an outpatient clinic at the American Hospital in Paris (1 hour commute from my hotel, but I needed a same day appointment where people speak English). Walk in, ask where I need to go; receptionist gives me a map and draws a line with where to go. I follow the line; the hospital looks much different than the map; I'm lost, and then starting to panic that I'm going to miss my appointment. I ask around and finally someone directs me to the right location. Doc diagnoses me with pharyngitis, prescribes me a few meds, one being prednisolone. I ask where I can get the meds, and I'm told any pharmacy. Great! I go to the closest pharmacy; they're sold out of prednisolone, and according to the pharmacist, so are many other pharmacies in Paris. I then keep walking around the city from pharmacy to pharmacy until I finally find one that sells prednisolone. \n\nI'm not writing this post for pity; rather, I keep thinking about how easy it would be for someone  who has responsibilities that would not allow them to be gone on all day to give up all together and just suffer with their illness. It is easy to pass judgement on patients who are referred for X but not ever follow-up with it\/make their condition worse, but healthcare systems are so fragmented, referrals are often to strangers or businesses we've never stepped foot in, we have no idea what a patients income is, etc., that I'm surprised it's not more common for patients to never go to that specialist(s) you referred them to, get that sold out or expensive drug, etc. I have no idea how to fix these problems, so I've decided to just vent  -_-","upvote_ratio":0.93,"created_utc":1675729638.0},{"title":"What degrees should you (or shouldn\u2019t you) go back to school for?","author":"PharmDist","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/medicine\/comments\/10vjnw4\/what_degrees_should_you_or_shouldnt_you_go_back\/","text":"Most medical professionals seem to go back to school to get their MPH or MBA.

When this was first proposed, it was \"until I had privileges\" (at this time, I was partnering with another attending).  After I got privileges, I immediately started taking service on my own, and it was \"until the end of the month\".  Then it was until I got \"busier\" (noticing a pattern at this point, I attempted to get a more specific threshold, which he refused to give).\n\nI have several other concerns with his management, most of which can be summed up as micromanagement, but to be blunt I think the list of complaints is probably substantial and unique enough that it could be enough to identify me (this post started out a lot longer).  This is the most problematic one for me though.\n\nSO, my questions:\n\n1. How common is it to have new attendings staff service every week, during normal working hours but not evenings or weekends (except for an equitable share of call)?\n2. When it is done, how long does the new attending usually cover service in this way for?  Is \"months\" a typical duration?  Is it more of a productivity threshold, and if so is that threshold the long-term target or some lesser amount?\n3. If I object to this, but my chief refuses to budge and other division members stay out of it, do I have any options besides sucking it up for however long or quitting (which I really don't want to)?\n\nEdit: To clarify, I also currently have 4 half-day clinics, with the expectation when I signed that I will need 5 to meet my eventual RVU requirements.  And I am working on a few different projects to try to improve care in a few regards.  I gave one didactic, but most of my education responsibilities stem from being on service and occasionally having someone in clinic with me.","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1675632544.0},{"title":"Does poor rate control in A-Fib cause an increased risk of stroke in patients who are not on anticoagulation?","author":"C12H16N2","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/medicine\/comments\/10ukzux\/does_poor_rate_control_in_afib_cause_an_increased\/","text":"This is a really specific question, but I just want to know if I am understanding the pathophysiology of thrombosis in A-Fib and stroke correctly.

The restrictions on methadone availability including take-home dosing were loosened during the COVID-19 pandemic although there have been concerns about the high street value of diverted methadone. This report examined how fatal overdoses involving methadone have changed over the past two-decades including during the pandemic.\n\n*Methods:*\n\nThe CDC\u2019s Wide-ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research (WONDER) was used to find the un-intentional methadone related overdose death rate from 1999 to 2020. Unintentional methadone deaths were defined using the ICD X40\u201344 codes with only data for methadone (T40.3). Data from the Drug Enforcement Administration's Automation of Reports and Consolidated Orders System (ARCOS) on methadone overall use, opioid treatment programs use, and pain management use was gathered for all states for 2020 and corrected for population.\n\n*Results:*\n\nThere have been dynamic changes over the past two-decades in methadone overdoses. Overdoses increased from 1999 (0.9\/million) to 2007 (15.9) and declined until 2019 (6.5). Overdoses in 2020 (9.6) were 48.1% higher than in 2019 (t(50) = 3.05, p < .005). The state level correlations between overall methadone use (r(49) = +0.75, p < .001), and opioid treatment program use (r(49) = +0.77, p < .001) with overdoses were positive, strong, and statistically significant. However, methadone use for pain treatment was not associated with methadone overdoses (r(49) = \u22120.08).\n\n*Conclusions:*\n\nOverdoses involving methadone significantly increased by 48.1% in 2020 relative to 2019. Policy changes that were implemented following the COVID-19 pandemic involving methadone take-homes may warrant further study before they are made permanent.\n\n[https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0379073823000294](https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0379073823000294)\n\nAnyone surprised?","upvote_ratio":0.91,"created_utc":1675434948.0},{"title":"DOs, how do you feel about \u201cMD notified\u201d?","author":"zeatherz","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/medicine\/comments\/10sag5c\/dos_how_do_you_feel_about_md_notified\/","text":"Does it make you feel left out?\n\nI\u2019ve started documenting \u201cphysician notified\u201d instead just so you can feel included","upvote_ratio":0.89,"created_utc":1675396746.0},{"title":"My OTC URI cocktail (EXPERT)","author":"MEANINGLESS_NUMBERS","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/medicine\/comments\/10s5j0g\/my_otc_uri_cocktail_expert\/","text":"Acetaminophen 650 mg\n\nIbuprofen 400 mg\n\nDextromethorphan 40 mg\n\nPhenylepherine 10 mg\n\nGuafenisen 400 mg\n\nPseudoephedrine 60 mg\n\nDiphenhydramine 50 mg\n\nXylometazoline 2 drops\n\nGin 2 oz\n\n**GOOD NIGHT**","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1675383196.0},{"title":"Predictions of future paradigm shifts in medicine","author":"woodstock923","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/medicine\/comments\/10se0zo\/predictions_of_future_paradigm_shifts_in_medicine\/","text":"We've seen a lot of change in recent years - from lipid nanoparticles to monoclonal antibodies, fecal microbiota transplants and early ambulation after surgery. \n\n\nWhat do you think will be among the new technologies and therapies discovered (or revived) in future practice?","upvote_ratio":0.94,"created_utc":1675408201.0},{"title":"The reason I\u2019m getting jaded","author":"Climatique","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/medicine\/comments\/10rrjc9\/the_reason_im_getting_jaded\/","text":"A woman we treated with a fungating breast mass back in 2020 is now back in our clinic with bony metastatic disease that we\u2019ll be treating (palliative radiation).

Monday to Friday from 8-16:30pm we also have one or two attending physicians in the ICU.  \nWe are pretty understaffed, for moths now - not because there is no possible employees but because the Vorstand (think of it as the Hospitals CEO) isn't willing to pay for sufficient amount of staff.\n\nIn case of a sickness of one member of staff it is common practice to call all other employees (that are not working on those days) to ask if they can help out. There is no compensation if you actually do so. Since we're heavily understaffed for about a year now, the willingness to help out is at a low point. In result the Chief physician started to order people to work even if they do not agree to help. You can refuse this order but if you do you have to face work-related legal consequences and would have to defend your case in a court. While you're likely to win (because the cases where even a Chief physician is allowed to order you to work once you have your shift-plan are very narrow) this is likely expensive and stressful, so at least at our hospital no one tried to refuse an direct order yet. I was ordered to work this way twice last year, in the last instance on December, 26th.  \nAs a result I decided not to pick up my phone anymore if the hospital is calling. You are not legally obligated to take any calls or messages from your employer in your off time in Germany. If the employer is not able to reach you, he can not order you to work. It's the only way to protect your free time.  \nI tried to convince the other doctors to do the same. This was also the legal advice of the union's lawyer. Sadly my colleagues are very hesitant to provoke any kind of conflict. They complain about the situation a lot, but they are not likely to act to force a change. Especially non-ICU doctors with work duty while a sick note comes in are likely to be ordered to take over the shifts face to face which makes it especially hard to refuse.\n\nSo today the person that would have worked 12-hour night-shifts from Friday to Sunday called in sick. The Hospital tried to call me several times - I did not pick up. The Chief physician than sent me a Voice message via Whatsapp (It is VERY uncommon to get contacted via social media from you Employer) which I did not listen to.  \nI don't know what happened after this. Someone will probably work those shifts. I am very sure that hell will break over me next week. The usual approach of the employer is a reversal of guilt, blaming me that others had to work in my place, telling me all the trouble is my fault while completely ignoring the fact that the employer is obligated to prepare for a typical amount of sick notes bei either installing on-call duties or a reserve pool (needs more staff) or paying for on-demand honorary staff (even more expensive that more staff). It's also possible that I will be threatened with legal actions.\n\nI am sure that I am doing the right thing - legally and also to change the unbelievable toxic working environment in my hospital. But damn, I'm nervous as fuck.\n\nTell me about your own experiences.

Anyway, this post is less about all that and more about my relationship with residents as a PA.\n\nI work very closely with residents (we are a non-academic center rotation for them if that helps provide context), though we typically work different days. There is usually only 1 resident, sometimes 2 and our schedules overlap fairly consistently, usually once or twice a week. We have similar duties when we are on call. Rounds, first call, traumas, consults, procedures, first assist in the OR, floor care\/critical care in the ICU, etc. \n\nI\u2019ve had a fantastic relationship with all the residents I\u2019ve worked with so far. We divide and conquer, helping each other as needed. I have the upmost respect for their educational process and actively go out of my way to ensure they get the procedures and cases they need. All I really care about is stabilizing and treating our patients to the highest standard. I don\u2019t care who puts the cordis in. If an intern\/PGY2 wants to put the cordis in, I\u2019m making sure we have a good secondary at the same time or that products are ready to roll, and vise versa.\n\nIn the OR, if the resident is there, I will second assist or manage things on the floor\/ICU\/cover traumas. That is, unless my attendings prefer me to first assist for some reason. Working for that long together, we\u2019ve become a well oiled machine and can anticipate each others next move. Sometimes our interns and new second years just aren\u2019t there yet (I can count on one hand how many times this has happened though, as they are typically pretty fucking good). Toward Summer, our second years are very very good. When we have our PGY3+\u2018s are on service, it\u2019s typically just me and the resident operating with our attending lurking in the periphery.\n\nIf things get crazy from an operative standpoint, I\u2019ll make sure their side of the list is squared away, orders are in, families are contacted, and the notes are done so they don\u2019t have to stay insanely late. If they do stay late, I\u2019ll cover the hospital in the morning so they can grab an extra hour or two before coming in (they usually come in anyway though because they\u2019re crackheads). Please let me know who I have to beat up so that you guys are paid at least as much as I am. The net hourly rate is nauseating. \n\nGiven the nature of their training, I learn a lot from having them around. They are great with keeping me up to date on the medicinal side of critical care, something I learned very little of in PA school. What I enjoy and appreciate most is what they bring to the table from their rotations in other sub specialties that I have no exposure to. \n\nI\u2019ve seen a lot of posts\/comments  regarding the low intelligence level of PAs and how we don\u2019t bring much to the table and make poor clinical decisions. While I can understand that rhetoric given some of my experiences with certain colleagues, I think its a gross generalization. I\u2019ve seen physicians, PAs, NPs, RNs, techs, pharmacist make consistently poor decisions. It usually has more to do with them as a person and how much they are willing to apply themselves to improving their clinical knowledge, day in and day out. A lot of folks get complacent and overconfident, sometimes grossly incompetent because of poor confidence, and as a result, consult everyone under the sun, which has its own set of problems. That was a bit of a tangent, but I digress. \n\nI really enjoy working with the residents that rotate through our service and (unless my social intelligence is terrible) I think they really enjoy working with me as well. Truly feels like a team when we are on call together.","upvote_ratio":0.92,"created_utc":1674323113.0},{"title":"Which specialties tend to be the most politically liberal and conservative?

I got curious today about how exactly nicotine itself can cause endothelial dysfunction, which is something I've been aware of since working in a cardiology clinic for a couple of years. It seems like this is at least partially attributed to excess catecholamine-mediated vasoconstriction. For this reason, it would of course not be recommended for patients at risk of CVD to use nicotine in any form. \n\nThis got me thinking, however, about whether or not stimulant medications could also cause endothelial dysfunction through a similar mechanism. Even \"non-stimulant\" medications like bupropion significantly increase levels of circulating catecholamines. More so with medications like Adderall. \n\nI am of course aware of blood pressure\/HR monitoring in patients on these medications, but never hear endothelial dysfunction discussed on its own. In fact, it's quite difficult to find any research on the topic at all.

Not in the Cartman style of \"respect my authority, but rather the Marcus Welby, MD style where the patient or their family understands that you have a firm understanding of the current clinical situation and are confident in your medical knowledge.  Introduce yourself to the patient and all guests\/family\/friends.  Eye contact, use names, be personable, all that.  You can typically accomplish this by providing a short summary of the current situation and it's basic prognosis.  \n\nSTEP ONE: Probe for patient\/family knowledge.  Ask what the patient or their family understands of the diagnosis and its treatment.  For a cancer patient, ask what they have discussed with their oncologist; is their proposed course of chemotherapy\/radiation\/surgery intended to cure or simply palliate?  For the elderly person in a rehab; is he participating in PT\/OT and is it expected that the trach will come out and he'll go home.  Figure out what you need to educate them on. \n\nSTEP TWO: Introduce the reality of the current situation.  If the patient is 90 years old, demented, unable to walk and in septic shock with respiratory failure, tell them that even with the best care, there is little chance that he will walk out of the hospital.  For the patient with metastatic cancer, if their heart were to stop, resuscitation will only delay the inevitable and likely result in the need for life support (ventilated, feeding tube, IV drugs--use colloquial language).  \n\nSTEP THREE: Gather information about the patient's wishes.  Ask if they have an advanced directive, living will, POLST.  Determine the NOK or POA.  Enquire if they ever said they \"wouldn't want to be on a machine\" or something similar. \n\nSTEP FOUR: Give your opinion.  This is where the majority of physicians stumble.  They offer resuscitation as if it was a McDonald's menu (I am talking silly things like \"chemical codes\" and \"no intubation but give CPR.\"  Tell the patient or family that in your medical opinion there is little chance for meaningful recovery if we intubate \/ start pressors and antibiotics \/ attempt CPR.  Explain that cardiopulmonary resuscitation is an attempt to bring a dead person back to life; I know that you are not legally dead until a doctor deems it so, but once you lose a pulse you are dead for all intents and purposes.  I frame ACLS as an attempt to \"bring you back from the dead if your heart stops beating by using chest compressions, electrical shocks, and chemicals.\"  \n\nSTEP FIVE: Synthesize the answer.  Working with your knowledge of the patient's condition and their wishes, suggest the course of action that you think is medically sound.  If your patient is otherwise healthy and has a good chance for meaningful recovery, suggest full code with all resuscitation modalities.  On the other hand, if the patient has little chance of meaningful recovery, suggest DNR\/DNI.  Explain that such a status does not mean that they will not receive treatment for their medical condition, but rather that we aren't going to interfere in the case of a natural death (ie their heart stopping).  If the patient is so unwell that they are actively dying, suggest comfort care with DNR\/DNI and explain that medical intervention would only prolong the inevitable.  Use any knowledge of the patient's wishes to defend your position; for instance, explain that CPR is likely to result in uncle Ed ending up on machines and he said that he would never want to live like that.  \n\nThere it is, the EPIGGS method of asking code status and discussing end of life topics.  It's not a rigid step-by-step method and you are allowed to skip between steps, but documenting it as a stepwise process helps learners incorporate the material. \n\nThe biggest take away is to always remember that you are the doctor.  You have the knowledge of the realities of futile care and the harms it leads to.  Do not hold your opinion back.  You are allowed to make a recommendation.  Expecting patients and their families to understand all the nuance and make the decision themselves is placing a cruel burden on their shoulders.  It is especially cruel when we resent them for making the \"wrong choice\" to pursue futile care.  \n\nInformed consent means just that.  You inform yourself and then inform the patient and their decisions makers.  However, you don't have to present the options as equal choices.  Tell them bluntly what your recommendation is, be it full code or comfort care.  The patient or family can still refuse, but most are relieved to have the burden unloaded by a physician they trust.  \n\nTrust is the key part of this process.  If you fail to Establish rapport and authority (\"E\" in EPIGGS) they will not trust your advice and the process fails.  \n\nLove to hear any criticisms or your own advice.  Let's get a conversation going for all the learners out there, from January Interns to PGY-30's and up.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1673352532.0},{"title":"People associated with Association of American Medical Colleges and Indian-origin medical doctors","author":"throwawayspock","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/medicine\/comments\/109biqz\/people_associated_with_association_of_american\/","text":"Hello!
