I want to buy some nice sheets. They're using eucalyptus to make sheets now, in addition to bamboo and standard cotton. \n\nWho has tried eucalyptus sheets? Bamboo? What are your thoughts? Before I drop $150 on one set of sheets I did some research. We live in the desert, and our second story master gets into the mid-80s during summer. My husband is a sweaty sleeper. One website said eucalyptus doesn't whick away sweat but another website said it does. I know eucalyptus wrinkles faster but that wouldn't bother me. I also read eucalyptus can't handle heat, so no dryer. \n\nSo what kind of sheets do y'all use? Brands?",

She doesn't understand why I don't want to live with her or call her everyday and when I tried to explain she wasn't able to meet me with compassion but instead said my words hurt her. I want to love my mom and have a relationship with her so I asked if she'd be open to hiring a translator so we can have therapy together but she says it would bring shame if someone in the community knew our private matters. I love my mom but I have to limit most interactions just to avoid getting triggered by her and eventually blowing up into a fight. I know most of our issues stem from her not getting her emotional needs met either - she didn't have role models for this and in turn is only trying her best. But being constantly invalidated and misunderstood is wearing me down. Just wanted to share and hope others who feel similar know they are not alone.",

And now my brother is showing signs of the same behavior towards my mom that his dad did: \n- manipulating her\n- not taking responsibility for his actions \n- being reckless \n\nIt’s hurting my mom. For example, he persuaded her to get a new dog after our old one died. A puppy. She didn’t want to at first, but he kept begging her till she gave in. They agreed to share the “custody” of the dog. Shortly after that, he got his first girlfriend and he’s madly in love. She does not like dogs and he basically told my mom he cannot take care of the dog 50/50 and will not take the dog when he moves in with his new girlfriend (yes, they’re already talking about that..) \nMy mom is devastated. She simply cannot handle the energetic and frankly, really annoying, puppy. He told her: “well, then we just have to find it a new home.” This devastated her even more. My mom has never given up on an animal and it would break her heart to ‘betray’ this puppy.\n\nI want to talk to my brother about it. It makes me furious that his childish behavior is causing her pain. But how do I do it in a way that doesn’t make him defensive? Also, I fear that he will turn into his asshole dad. At this point I fear for my future relationship with him if he keeps acting like this. \n\nTLDR; my brother acting like his dad is hurting my mom",

For the past 6 years I have worked in vocational rehabilitation and assisting at-risk populations with job placement/training. I have faced a lot of challenges  in this industry but have proven myself to be reliable and reputable for my knowledge in labor laws and how to approach my clients. \n\nIn the last year, my employer has made many changes and has faced many challenges. We mainly work with juveniles and young adults which recently had an increase of mental illness and drug use. This is important because this has trigger a lot of self harm and mental health crisis. Something that our organization has limited resources as we are not a mental health/detention facility. This has triggered a lot of staff members much grief especially when not acquainted or trained in mental health or educated on drug use/addiction. Because of this departments/directors have been playing the blame game and not finding solutions with our changing population like appropriate training and resources to better service our clients. \n\nAs much as I have loved my journey, I feel I have come to the end when I realized that I have the strong potential to lead but have no desire in the industry let alone in an organization who discriminated those with disabilities. A lot of my colleagues have left before I was thinking about leaving.\n\nI feel I have the potential to grow in HR, but understand that I would need to look at an entry-level position even with my BBA in General Management. And I’m willing to take a coordinator position to gain that experience and have the chance to really grow.  \n\nI have shared with some colleagues that I am looking for job opportunities but being told that they would hate seeing me go. Several times have I gotten told that we need good staff and would hate to see me go, but I cannot continue when I whistleblow and nothing occurs. \n\nIt’s making me feel really guilty and trapped. It’s been a month and only got two interviews. My confidence is so shot and when going into applications, answering employer phone calls and going into interviews I can feel my lips quiver in crippling anxiety. I do want to disclose that I have PTSD (complex) and have worked hard to reduce the symptoms in my adult life. But it has never affected my professional confidence or my ability to rock an interview. Now I’m finding myself tossing and turning at night and I don’t know where I got lost in this. \n\n\nWhat is wrong with me? Where has my confidence gone? Why do I feel that all these older women who are in my profession aren’t being supportive? It’s making me feel that I’m better off staying where I’m at when I feel I’m better off somewhere else. That I’m not worthy elsewhere.\n\nI would love some perspective, testimonials and/or advice. \n\nAny ladies who made career changes? How long did it take?",

        "text": "As of last night I’m going through a breakup. I felt it for a while, and it got to me emotionally and physically, so I apologize for this vent intro part, I’m still kind of a mess and don’t currently have a therapist or much support. Some context, it was a 2.5+ year “partnership” that never fully felt like a partnership, but was 95% positive and wonderful until I confirmed last summer he was romantically texting his ex through our entire relationship, as I suspected but was reassured (gaslit?) I was wrong often. From that point, to stay together I asked for more security and to become officially bf/gf, asked to just see each other more than once every week or so, and asked him why he posts his friends on his social media but never me after years together, not even in stories. He said he didn’t like labels and was just busy and also had no excuse for the social media thing. He called us partners, but we never really ran errands, hiked, worked out, got groceries, walked my dog, cooked, etc. let alone travel, planned together, despite basically begging. He never offered to watch my dog or help me with house stuff or if he offered it was hypothetical about a “next time” that never came. I told him from the start there is no pressure about marriage or kids (still undecided about both), but my one want is someone to do some life stuff with. I do a TON alone and love it, but I want to occasionally share things too. As of last night we hadn’t hung out in three weeks. I’ve never felt less interesting or cool…even though I am. To have to beg someone to hang out with me is so sad. His ex would also happen to pop up where she knew he’d be, and it really triggered my insecurities having being cheated on in the past, but I mostly kept silent to keep peace. \n\nWe stayed together until last night, and my self esteem and self worth is at rock bottom. As a result, I don’t feel hot anymore or beautiful. I have my moments, but I’m not conventionally attractive at all, which feels glaringly obvious. I was his secret he was ashamed of showing people which I shared with him was a huge issue I had with my last 2 exes. I gained 18lbs since October, and my clothes don’t fit. I also have a very high-stress job on top of being a personal wreck, so I’ve been dreaming of a low stress job, but also realize that could be a bad decision and I would get FOMO if I left. I’m biting my cheeks and have migraines daily from stress, and I also looked at a few houses thinking about selling my place for somewhere else with new projects and scenery or maybe across the country? It’s like an identity crisis. When things are in an unsettled state, I feel like the rugs been ripped out from under me and tend to spiral and want to scrap everything about me and start over which sounds great, but obviously realistically could be awful and the opposite of what is needed. \n\nTL;DR Long story long (thanks to those who read the rambling drama), what are some “safe” decisions and changes that can be made and are less likely to cause more feel-awful in the future after breakups? Thank you for reading , genuinely.",

        "text": "TLDR at the bottom.\n\nI'm (37f) currently going through it, including but not limited to: a very toxic work environment I can't leave right now due to my niche career and no other local opportunities, major marriage trouble that might not be fixable, and a dying parent for whom I am the only caretaker. I started therapy today and my therapist recommended I take FMLA now. Not to take care of my parent but to take care of myself. She recommended taking the max amount of time which is about 12 weeks. \n\nI've never taken leave that long other than when I had my child and it scares me. Mostly because that's 12 weeks of no income from my job. My spouse can cover all our bills, but I worry he's going to resent that pretty quickly. I also worry about having no or little time off after the FMLA is over to take off for doctors appointments/vacations (if i ever take one)/ and for when my parent actually dies (which is likely to be within the year according to prognosis.)   But man, as much as it scares me, the thought of being able to drop something for a little while sounds so freaking good to me. Like to shove at least 1/3 of my stress and anxiety out of my life, even for a few weeks sounds like a goddamn delight. And obviously, a mental health professional with a PhD and 20 years of experience is suggesting it, so she's probably not wrong. \n\nMy therapist says she will support me in whatever I choose to do and we'll work through everything regardless but I would like to hear stories of women who took off work for non-maternity reasons and what your experience was. How did it help you? How did you go back to a 'normal' routine after? Did you have any cons or would you do anything differently?\n\nSo TLDR - I'm going through a lot and my therapist recommends taking 12 weeks off work. It's scary but enticing. Have you done something similar and how did it impact you positively or negatively?",

        "text": "I'm in my second year as a reading interventionist at a Title 1 elementary school in a major US city, plus I run our school's theater program-- I also live an hour's commute each way from my work. As you can guess, I'm usually utterly exhausted by the time I get home, and almost never go out on weeknights. My partner, on the other hand, works from home and has flexible hours as do most of his friends, so they're often out until pretty late during the week. \n\nYesterday was incredibly challenging. There's some toxic coworker stuff going on at my school, the kids are nutty right now because it's been raining, it's the end of the quarter so there's report cards to finish and several play performances to plan. To top it off, there was a literal suicide on the freeway that kept me sitting in traffic for over two and a half hours. \n\nYesterday also happened to be the same day that my partner was hosting a bunch of his friends at our place for a dinner party. We've had people over before, but only on the weekend-- doing it on a Wednesday was his idea and I didn't really push back on it though in retrospect I wish I had.\n\nMost of them were already there by the time I got home, but I was in a pretty foul mood so I went straight to the bedroom without saying hello first. My plan was to change out of my work clothes and relax for a few minutes before I had to go out and be social. My boyfriend came in, I explained that I had a terrible day and needed to rest and recharge but would be out soon, and I thought he understood and would explain it to everyone else.\n\nBut while I was in there, I began to get really frustrated by the noise level in the house. Loud talking and laughing, loud music, etc. I texted my boyfriend three times asking if he could get them to quiet down a little but he didn't read my texts let alone respond to them. I literally could not handle the idea of a crowded room full of loud people, so I didn't come out. \n\nI was kind of hoping he would come check on me but he never did, and then after about 45 mins, I fell asleep. I didn't mean to, but I was just so tired.  I woke up at 1am after everyone else had left and he was extremely mad, telling me how rude I was and how much I'd let him down. I apologized and tried to explain that I did text him, but he didn't respond so I eventually fell asleep, but he said I was trying to escape responsibility and blame everything on him. \n\nI felt absolutely horrible at first, but after talking about it with a couple of coworkers I started to feel differently. Teachers often feel like most folks don't understand how uniquely exhausting our jobs can be. That a bunch of people who work from home in their pajamas are judging me for being too tired to drink and party on a Wednesday was especially upsetting.\n\nWas in the wrong? Should my boyfriend have checked on me or at the very least checked his phone? Or should I just suck it up and try being more social during the week even if I'm exhausted?",

        "text": "Starting to feel like one of my high school besties (friends since 2007) isn’t worth keeping as a friend anymore. Over the last six years I don’t feel like she’s supported or been there for me the way others have, starting with the time she sort of implied that I brought a DV situation with my ex on myself in 2017. We discussed it and eventually smoothed things over, but have become more distant since she moved to from NYC to Massachussetts and even more so after she had her children in 2019 and last year.\n\nWhenever she visited NYC, she always reached out to hang last minute despite the planned trip and it worked out maybe once. I’m usually the one to reach out and ask how she’s doing, something I don’t think she’s done in at least a year or two for me. Made the effort to try and see her during COVID, but each time I’ve tried to suggest a time to visit she’s brushed me off or said “let me get back to you” which never happens. Even sent gifts for her kids and her + her husband without even so much as a thank you, just pics to let me know she received the stuff. The only times we’ve really spoken over the last two years was when she reached out randomly to mention two people we knew died, or to vent about her youngest child + entire family getting COVID only to disappear once again with no “hey how’s it going?”\n\nI get that it’s different for me as someone who isn’t married with kids (although I’m in a committed relationship), but I’ve seen her actively reach out to her college best friend and even invite her to stay in her home. When I reached out last summer to let her know I’m there to support/was worried I wasn’t being present, she mentioned how she knew she wasn’t really a present friend but made no mention of how she’d change things or apologize. I’m a firm believer in people making time for who they want to — kids or not.\n\nPart of me wants to let her know how I feel but the other part wants to cut her off completely bc I don’t feel like it’s worth explaining my feelings if nothing will change.

E.G., conversations you wish you’d had before you moved in, married, etc.**\n\n**And/or: Does anyone have stories about taking a leap of faith in a relationship? How did that turn out?**\n\nI think I’m mostly hoping to enjoy some shared anecdotes and group wisdom, but here’s my personal context for those interested:\n\nI (34F) am considering taking a bit of a leap of faith in my current relationship to move in together and move to a new city together simultaneously after a bit less than a year of dating (though it might be a year or more by the time we do this). \n\nMy partner (31M) has reached a big transitional moment in his working life and needs to leave his current position asap and start applying to other jobs in his field. There are a variety of conditions that are making his current role extremely stressful, and make this a very sensible time for him to seek greener pastures. There are no good local opportunities for him currently, so he will likely have to move, possibly to another state. This has cropped up pretty suddenly (his supervisor and counterpart both left without much warning), and we’ve both been overwhelmed, sad, and trying to process what this means for us.\n\nI’ve dated quite a bit in my life so far, and have been in a variety of different LTRs. I’ve also done a good amount of therapy, and have spent time reflecting on how those relationships have affected me, how I show up in them, etc. I decided a while ago that I don’t really give a shit about my personal career success (I have to keep a roof over my head, but have other priorities—mental health, building chosen family, personal growth, pursuing hobbies and creative pursuits, etc), but it also feels weird to wrap my brain around being a ‘trailing spouse’, and to make such a big jump all at once.\n\nOur relationship hasn’t been without challenges, but all in all, we talk about our issues really well and he’s been the best partner I’ve ever had so far. (A constantly rising bar.) I moved to my current community a year and a half ago, and I don’t have deep ties here yet, though I do like my life and job. Still—I love this guy and I guess I’m not ready to end the relationship over a move. In my heart of hearts, I think I want to see where this thing goes, and maybe I’m still a little more adventurous than I’d realized.\n\nSo, we’ve started having ongoing conversations about this and are exploring the idea of not breaking up over it. Most likely, this would mean that I would move with him. We don’t currently live together, and because we live in a rural area in neighboring towns, we’ve typically only been able to spend a night or two together each week for the last 10 months, when neither of us have been traveling. We do talk every day, throughout the day, but this would be a big change.",

I am 35 and I don’t want to rent another apartment so I can slave away paying someone else’s mortgage. I want to slave away to pay my own mortgage lol. I filled out an application with my bank’s website for mortgages, and I got a call right away from a loan officer. I missed the call because it was a Saturday so I assumed it was a spam call but he left a voicemail and I called him back. He didn’t answer and I left a voicemail. He called back one more time which I also missed because I was working, and I have now called him like 4x since then. I really want to get the ball rolling on this and get my life figured out. I need to separate myself from my ex-partner who pretty much manipulated me for years so he could sit on his butt and smoke weed while someone paid 2/3 of the bills so he could afford weed. He is obsessed with weed. I can’t even ask him to do the dishes without him snapping at me. I can’t stick up for myself or say or do anything about the inequality of bills and labor without being called a jerk or a bully. He constantly complains about everything and is always wining and I am so done with the gas lighting.

And honestly that really scares me. I’m single when I have been in relationships my entire adult life, I don’t know what it’s like to travel alone, live alone.. be alone.\n\nBut being 35 seems to already have limitations, some countries won’t let you move there after 30 unless you have a job like a doctor or carpenter. Some jobs seem to only want to hire graduates, what if I’m the oldest new hire? And dating, from what I’ve heard, only gets more confusing and difficult after this age (divorcees, have kids etc).\n\nIs this it? At 35 have I missed the boat?",

I have too much alone time.\n\nI’m 31 and work full time, but don’t really have any friends (I live abroad, in a country that is notorious for being difficult to integrate into) and despite trying classes, sports and working here full-time, I’ve made 1 friend (and that friendship is complicated) who I rarely see. I’ve hung out with no one except my partner and work colleagues at work for the past 18 months. I’m estranged from my parents (I grew up in a very insular community, think Travellers) and got shunned for having a relationship outside of our ethnic group. \n\nMy partner was worth it and is amazing, but he works away a lot, including international travel, has school 2 nights a week, and so some weeks I barely see him for more than 30 minutes a day.\n\nI’m trying to keep my life interesting. I do fencing, yoga, go for manicures, walk my dog twice a day for an hour each time, work out, read, listen to podcasts, research my interests, game, travel solo abroad, cook, decorate, do puzzles, go to local cafes and sit. My career is pretty lucrative and low stress. \n\nBut I feel so empty. I have so much time to myself that it all feels a bit forced. I’m an introvert, but even for me, this feels extreme.\n\nI’ve being trying to conceive for a year now and I’m in fertility treatment for unexplained infertility, which is quite tough and I have no one to tell. I was hoping a baby might help me feel less alone and I might meet other mothers who I could talk to. But even that’s not working out for me. \n\nI’ve started getting sick more regularly and took a couple of weeks off recently to handle feeling burned out. I’ve received an offer for a new job that sounds more interesting that I’ll start in April. \n\nI’m travelling to a new country tomorrow for a week but I’m struggling to muster any excitement. \n\nI just feel a bit dead inside. I’ve tried therapy with a few different therapists and it’s never proven helpful. \n\nI don’t really expect answers here, but I just needed to vent and hope someone reads this.",

She was the one that actually started us on this path.  She really likes Zumba which she has been doing and enjoying.\n\nLast night, out of the blue, she said that she is done going to workout. That she \"sees no benefit.\" It really caught me off guard.\n\nThere are obvious health benefits to working out. There has been a benefit to our relationship since we are doing it together. That has been nice to just hangout and do something together. I have enjoyed that.\n\nSo eventually she said that she has only lost weight in her breasts, and she has a large D size, and that she sees them starting to drop and it has made her self conscious. That if this continues that she wont be able to wear a swim suit, or a tank top, etc without being self conscious.  But on the other hand if she stops working out then \"I will resent her for it.\" So she is in between a rock and a hard place. In her own words.\n\nI like the fact that we are working out together.  I obviously like that we are both losing weight. I have continued to feel attracted to her sexually.  I don't want to make this about me... I want to help her decide what she wants to do.  I don't like that she is not going to work out for the health benefits but I can see where she would feel self conscious. This is a tuff one for me.\n\nI could really use some help on this one. I have no clue where to go from here....",

I started out in hospitality and worked long weekends to make money when I wasn't in school. I adored hospitality. I enjoyed working in my hone city and showing tourists around, I loved the social aspect of it, even though the hours were long and pay was short. I worked restaurants and cafes until I hit 19. I ran myself into the ground in this line of work, which on too of school exam stress, triggered a massive flare up in my chronic illness which has not settled since. Since then I have been in and our of different office jobs corporate positions and and some slower paced jobs, while doing an undergraduate and masters. The pandemic annihilated my mental health. I am only dealing with a lot of the trauma and healing and recovering from this now. So fast forward to today, I am 6 months off graduating from my masters, and working a pretty chill minimum wage job at an exhibition. \nHowever, I feel like I have put all this work in to achieving my degrees and at the very end, I do not think I will have the mental capacity for a corporate 40 hour a week job, never mind the physical capacity with my long term illness. I want to own a house, get married and have children in the future, and this will take a fairly well paying job to support, but I genuinely feel so burnt out with working and education and the idea of going back into the  fake corporate environment exhausts me. The idea of just being expoited by a workplace for very little pay is exhausting to think about. I suppose I am just worried that I will have wasted my potential and my qualifications, but I also can't face the idea of the heavy work that I always saw myself doing until I reture due to illness and burnout over the last couple of years. I just wish I had the physical ability again to work in restaurants and cafes. I lobed doing that kind of work it just takes such a toll on my physical health.

No offense to the husbands/partners who are usually lovely and interesting people, but the thought of trying to get to know someone while their partner is present and forced upon me as a friend is strange to me. If I ask a woman to grab a quick coffee sometime as a potential entry point into a friendship between us, I don't know why this is seen as an open invitation to her spouse into my social life and into my partner's social life.\n\nAnd it's not a blanket rule as it does depend on the couple. There are some couples who each have separate friends and bring them together for gatherings and so you'll mostly always end up socialising with them as a couple, but because it's a group of people it's not a couple date and I'm not exactly forced to get to know their partner on a deeper level. \n\nBut I've noticed the types who try to implement couple-dates straight away seem not to have much in terms of a social life outside of their partners.\n\nWomen who do this, I'm seeking to understand. Do you have more fun while on couple dates? Do you have social anxiety and would like to have your partner as a support? Are you limited by time and social time is the only time you get to spend with your SO? Is your SO your best friend and you can't imagine a social life without them? \n\nP.S. I am not talking about couples with children. That is a point where the rules have to go out the window. I'm talking about women with no children who don't want to make friends without their partner being part of it.",

I didn’t dispute any transactions. There was NO fraud. I just needed a new card.\n\nAn employee mistakenly reversed six months of purchases - every single purchase I had made - by marking them as fraud. I would say at least 200 transactions were instantly reversed and I received $14,900+ in a statement credit.\n\nDozens of businesses and individuals I’ve done business with began calling me daily asking why I disputed charges for products and services received. Eventually all my accounts like Target and Amazon were locked and I couldn’t use them since I had large “unpaid” balances. My cable and internet were shut off. I was kicked out of my gym. The short version is very few places had an ounce of sympathy and have treated me like a person who intentionally committed fraud.\n\nWhile they have reversed it finally (a month after my entire life was impacted) I’m still being greatly impacted. Just as a few examples, many of these places like my gym and cable and internet will no longer allow electronic payments and I’ll now be required to walk in and pay cash for all future payments due to the “attempted fraud” (which was actually a mistake by a Chase employee). Some companies say they haven’t even *received* the funds back from Chase. \n\nSo, while these may seem like first world problems I have lost sleep and had literal anxiety attacks from all this. I’ve called every consumer protection attorney in my area and I can’t find one willing to sue a bank. I’m curious if anyone has any educated suggestions because I feel I should sue for damages.",

It’s been a long while since I looked for a job while unemployed. I’m scared this will look bad to employers and no one will want to hire me. I’m scared of running out of money, but we have plenty saved up and can live on husband’s salary alone. I feel so out of control. How do I stay positive and sane?",

He’s one of the kindest, outgoing, and most supportive people I’d ever known. But lately he has become everything opposite of that — isolated, condescending, and rude. \n\nDuring the pandemic, he started dating a guy who  grew up in a Mormon church in Utah. This guy (44M) is very recently divorced, and has a ton of unresolved trauma about being gay and growing up in a religious community. \n\nI know this because my friend has radically changed since they started dating. My friend posts extremist content online, thinks the world is going to end tomorrow, and often gets outraged at seemingly innocent things.\n\nIt feels like there’s NOTHING you can say to him without it turning into an awful rant about politics. He has also grown increasingly condescending in his tone, even though almost nothing he posts online is even true. It’s just non-stop posts from radical accounts on Instagram. \n\nWhen I ask him what changed, he said his bf teaches him these things because he’s a “passionate guy.”\n\nAll of our mutual friends have noticed this and have distanced themselves from him. He has even told me that he has no friends left anymore- and I think the isolation from others has made him even more emotionally reliant on his partner. \n\nMeanwhile, his partner has filed for permanent residency in Canada (because my friend is Canadian and lives in Vancouver) and I can’t help but think he’s using my friend in order to make the move out of the States, because he has often talked about wanting to leave the country forever. \nThe partner also doesn’t have a job, so he’s been living off the money that my friend makes. \n\nIs it OK to tell him that I’m worried about him? They seem very close, and are always posting about each other online (sweet, coupley things). Or will this only lead to me becoming the bad guy?",

Does feeling sad about not living alone anymore/leaving my (tiny) 1 bed mean I'm doing the wrong thing?**\n\nMe and my boyfriend have been together for 7 years, since we were 22. We've been around the relationship block. Neither of us are in a rush to get married, but decided Jan 2022 that we'd like to move in together. We both had some career changes/financial setbacks (#justcovidthings), so today we finally made it happen- we signed the lease to a 3 bed apartment with a private backyard; closer walk to the train station for me, an office for him, and pet friendly so we can finally get a cat!\n\nThe thing is, I've been living alone for almost 3 years and I love it. I also love my apartment. It's old and crummy because it's an affordable one bedroom, but it has the most incredible view. I can sit out on my fire escape and see the whole city skyline and the sun rise over it. I can look down on an oddly green patch of my city- historic church property, and watch deer graze (deer! in the city! can you believe that?), hear crickets and feel the breeze. The rooms are small but a fine size for one person, and the windows are tall enough, with wide enough sills to stand in, or curl up on. It's magical and it's real and it's mine. I've fortified my place, this beautiful little haven, and kept it through covid and financial setbacks, thick and thin. I love this place, so so much.\n\nI also love my boyfriend, so so much. HE'S been with me through covid and financial setbacks, thick and thin. We're soft and open with each other, we've grown with each other, challenged each other. He's patient and sensitive and ambitious. We travel well together and we want to travel more- we want the same things and we're good at getting the things we want together! \n\nI want to move in with him. So why, after we signed the lease together and he left for practice, am I staring out at my beautiful view crying big fat salty tears? I can't believe I am actually saying goodbye to this place, and it's not like I haven't tried to work through that- I've journaled (you've probably ascertained by now that I can go on a decent tangent), I've cried, I've talked to my mom and my friends, and I'm just so heartbroken. \n\nI want to live with him, and I think I can get past this. I got a sunny feeling in my gut when we finally (after much stressful deliberation) made this decision. And yet I seem to have emotionally blindsided myself in spite of my attempts to prepare for this moment. The creeping fear that I have tried to journal about and work through, but never really fully resolved remains; what if it's wrong? How do I know? Should I stay in my little haven that I love? Should I leave him and run away and be alone in my little world forever? It probably sounds INSANE reading that back and you'll probably judge me for it, but like it or not that is really what is playing over and over in my heart.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHelp!!!!",

I finished up in therapy in January because I'm in a good place.

The person is incredibly adept at gaslighting and not taking responsibility and bombarded them with messaged about how they're terrible and abandoned them etc for the rest of the day. I didn't experience the throwing things around but the verbal abuse and gaslighting is all to familiar. \n\nI thought that I would be ok because I've put so much distance and I have worked really hard to recover.

As a result, my 20s weren't as eventful as they should be. \n\nI feel they always manipulate me, put doubt in my head, and probably gaslight me. \n\nMy partner and I are looking to buy a new car. I've been calling and emailing places around and the car we want might be around $38-40k. We finally make good money to buy it and to keep up with monthly payments. I'd put half in a down payment and he'll handle the monthly payments. Insurance for the new car will be divided as well. I don't drive. My parents have really put us down in this little dream of ours. My dad wants us to buy a used car, invest our money, and then buy a new car 7+ years from now. My mom says we're doing things backwards and should live together instead first and then get a car. My dad probably also upset because he wants me to loan him $20k so he can start his little food business. He over worked himself for decades as well but has been unemployed since 2020 after getting laid of due to COVID. \n\nMy partner and I don't live together yet even though we've been together for 13 years. I blame my parents for installing fear into me and saying I couldn't move out till I was married. But they always put me and my partner down because they knew he couldn't provide a good financial life for me during the majority of his 20s. He overworks himself and now he has a better job and feels like he can prove himself to them. I'd say they also put self doubt into him and why he's been so scared to take our relationship to the next step (eg. moving out). \n\nMoving out has been a dilema as well because my dad always questions how we're going to buy everything for our apartment. He says we're going to spend over $10k to buy furniture and all this other stuff all at once. My dad also wants us to buy a house together either here in our city or to go to Texas. Or he wants me to buy a house, rent it out, and make money that way...My mom says our relationship will change once we live together. She makes it seem like our relationship will suck. And says I should get to know him better...I've been with him since we were teenagers and now we're both 30! we are both very honest and open with each other. I know all his flaw and he knows mine. We don't keep secrets and when we mess up we are always upfront about them. My mom is just projecting because my father is an awful companion. \n\nI've been trying to cut the leash and spread my wings but then I come back to my parents for support or praise. But I feel dragged down. And it makes me unsure about my future life and whether or not I'd be able to succeed living with my partner. Not to mention now they are badgering us for grand kids!! \n\nHow much influence do your parents have in your life? Do they make you have self doubt in yourself? \n\nI have thought about going no contact with them after I move out...they stress me out too much but I'd also feel guilty if I left them because I'm an only child.",

        "text": "So basically on one of my posts I am met someone from here. It was a neutral username and the comment was funny so I DMed it.\nStarted talking and he told me he was a guy. Married with kids. \nHad a lot of fun talking and just fucking around. \nSometime after. Goes and tells me she's a female. That's okay too. We keep talking. \nOne thing I noticed was the inflated ego. Should have taken it as a red flag and run but the conversation was good so far so I didn't mind. \n\nNow. I joke around and call myself Fat.\nFat shamming starts as a joke. Again and again. Asks my waist and decides I am not fat. I insist I am. \nAll well and good. (Although should have taken it as a redflag too)\n\nNext she is gyming and texting me simultaneously.Tells me she is very competive and likes to win (nothing wrong right? It was also fun as I was out with friends too. \nMidway during the conversation. Tells me she's  feminist. Not a radical one(surprise surprise) but still one. I say I respect that but I should tell her I am not one. Goes and says but it's just rights. Not women rights. But rights. \nI make it clear, I have my reasons for not supporting it, I don't agree with what it means today. (Radical illogical man hating tribe that it is today)\n\nMidway working out. Completely out of the blue. I get a freaked out text. \nI can't squat here. I said. Why ? Are you very sweaty? (I thought she got a mark on her pants, I don't gym lol)\nBut she says and let me put this boldly LINE UP TO STARE AT MY ASS. \nIn a mixed gym. Where everyone probably comes to workout.\nSo as it is a big city or Pakistan. I naturally wonder and ask. Is there no all female gym around you if you feel uncomfortable and this happens often. \n\nShe goes to lecture me about how I am minimizing the problem and not actually talking about the attitude of oogling and how asking her that was automatically me focusing on the wrong thing. \n\nI tried explaining that that was the last thing on my mind. I was talking about what she or I as an individual can do. But to no avail. \nWe both calm down. \n\nI make a point. That no one can charge someone for staring now can they? So instead we focus on what we can control. She tells me like I am wrong and staring is harassment punishable by law. \nI laugh in her face and tell her. It's not. And there's stalking laws only (I had restraining orders in mind)So asked her to Find me proof. \nI checked it before so I know it is not a law. And just common sense. How can you even prove staring in a court of law. It's just dumb logic.\nShe finds me two differnt country cases of HR laws in workplace and a whole different one where court punishes a person who had asked a woman on a date 3 4 times before and she had rejected. \n\nI laughed in her face a second time and said she had lost this debate. \nWe went back and forth and I knew she wasn't gonna give in even tho she was to me completely and utterly wrong. So I said you win. \n\nLater on. I ask her. So what are you gonna do about squating. She says. She's gonna use a towel (wrap it around herself to do squats to keep eyes away.\nI inserted quickly. That was the whole seperate gym argument again. The towel is same as the seperate gym.\n\nShe goes off again on how it was a false anlogy and I was again focusing on the wrong thing. \nWell we bury the hatchet again. And go to sleep.\n\n\n}The whole night. There were mostly jokes. Before the feminism thing. Some slight teasing. I was calling her Horni boii and she was calling me horni boi as we started talking from a post about how scamming horni boys would be so easy if we tried. Actually we started talking when (I at the time thought it was a He) he said. Let's do it as a prank. ]\n\nNext morning. \nNow I will admit I gave a bit more information than I should have and it was in poor taste.\n\nShe asks me: What are you upto?\n\nMe : (I was naked at the time and just woken up so morning wood and in bed)\n\n\"You don't wanna know 😈😈😈\"\n\nShe : Tell me\n\nMe: Tells her I am still in bed and woke up naked and have morning wood. And she is not happy with how I responded. So I move on. (Hoping this hasn't made me an asshole so far.) Next \n\nWe talk about her job and what she has to do. And the city she lives in. Fast forward to this. She was on a meeting. \n\nScreen shots. \nhttps://ibb.co/NSNk7CM\nAnother joke we were constantly making that she would tell me to find a horni boy to scam and I would say no you do it.\n\nSecond screenshot \nThe debate I am referring to is our argument of oogling/staring to be punishable by law or not. Or harassment or not by law\nhttps://ibb.co/xSQNtG9\n\nAfter this I got increasingly pissed off because I thought she was neing narcissistic and an ass. \nAnd eventually she said Bye. \n\nI quite enjoyed my conversation with her right until she told me she's a Feminist and I told her I am not. \nAfter that I constantly felt like there was a tension and sense of pushing me to appear more smarter and refined than me.lol and worse after our gym argument which I teased her about winning. \nAlthough I think the fatshaming and talking me how I always like to win now seem like red flags to me too. \n\nSo if you've read so far. Go for it. \nAm I the Asshole here?\n\nPosting it here. I am petty as fuck but still lol",

I felt my value was my appearance. I dabbled in modeling and always wanted to be included in every photo. And I was constantly told I look young for my age.  \n\nBut when 33 hit, everything changed. My face has practically collapsed. All that youthful collagen seems to have disappeared. And it's impossible to take a good photo these days, so I avoid the camera. All I see is big bags under my eyes and jowls.  \n\nEvery now and then my phone will send me \"photo memory reminders\" and I am horrified by how young I looked back in 2021 compared to what I looked like now. \n\nIt's made me not want to date and makes me feel unlovable. Anyone else experience this? I'm REALLY struggling :(",

        "text": "For context, I work in a school. In my classroom, there is a teacher and 8 teacher aides. Two of the aides are close friends with the teacher (all three are under 26), and get away with doing the bare minimum. They act like they're in charge of the class, they can come and go as they please, take extended breaks, and constantly text eachother and the teacher to complain about the rest of us, and the teacher let's them get away with it. A couple of the other aides, myself included, are getting frustrated by the favortism but are unsure how to handle this. Speaking to the classroom teacher would be awkward, since she's friends with these women and perpetuating their behavior. Do those of us with an issue come together and speak to her anyway, do we go to the principal, or just let it go in general?",
