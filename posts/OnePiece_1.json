The translation was a bit ***FUNKY*** but if Vegapunk told the world what he learned Oda says in a text bubble \"TOTAL WAR\" would happen.\n\nVegapunk clearly knows everything about the will of D and the ancient kingdom, which means that the One Piece is not information. It's not old Joy Boys journal or anything like that. Everything I have, I left it in that one place. Wtf does he have except his dreams, his will and his friends?\n\nIt's not gold, it's not information, it's not a secret weapon. Oda lied when he said \"It's not the friends we made along the way\" just to make us extra hyped and to make it not obvious. But it is. Roger opened that empty chest and realized that the adventure and the friends was the treasure. Everything else is impossible. There is nothing at raftel. \n\n**Tell me one good thing that the one piece can be, and I mean specific. Not information. Not gold (cause you can find it in other places). The only thing you can find is the spirit of adventure and the friends you made along the way are your treasure.**",

I get he was beaten so would think maybe it's just not worth the effort anymore, but also he got beaten before and just resuscitated himself then continued fighting. Perhaps it's better explained in the manga or something?\n\nI also don't understand why Eneru wanted the bell so bad, he says how it's befitting of a god, so did he intend to put it on the ship? Did he plan to just look at it? Why would he not just teleport up there and bring it down during the building of the ship?",

The Sattelites of Vegapunk are not any less real, they are Vegapunk. They each refer to themselve as Vegapunk and refer to each other (including Stella!) with their individual names. \n\nThat is especially important with the 1078 reveal.  This is not \"tech gone wrong\" - this is VPs very own *desire*.  As much as his wrath about worldly limitations in Atlas, as much as his ruthlessness in Lilith, all of that is Vegapunk. See his past in Mads and the cover story. \nThe quirky old man is not his true personality it is just one dimension of the whole, and I believe the way people are talking about the character really undersells what Oda seems to be going for.

But I feel like it’s pretty clear as day that ashura is indeed a conjuration of conquerors and here is my reasoning. \n\nKaku asks himself “is he really using his spirit to create illusions” after witnessing zoro using ashura. What I took from this is oda telling us that zoro is using his spirit here to create this and conquerors haki has been referred to by a few names and one of them being “conquerors spirit” \n\nafter zoro uses ashura again on kaido he states. “So you have conquerors haki too?” Confirming that zoro has conquerors haki but he doesn’t Necessarily say that ashura itself is conquerors. \n\nNow that we know that zoro used his spirit to create ashura and he also has conquerors haki or conquerors spirit doesn’t this mean he is using his spirit of a conqueror to conjure ashura? \n\nOf course it hasn’t been explicitly stated “OMG ZORO CREATED ASHURA WITH CONQUERORS” but sometimes I think the fans need to piece things together instead of waiting for only clear statements before they believe anything \n\nWhat’s your guys thoughts on this you think I’m full of shit or you think ashura is conquerors",

        "text": "If we look closely, the adventure of Luffy and the Straw Hats began in East Blue where they fought against low-level pirates. Oda gave us a little hint of a WARLORD (Mihawk).\nThen we entered the sagas of the warlords (Crocodile, Moria, Kuma, Doffy) and in between Oda gave us a hint of a YONKO (Whitebeard).\nFinally we move on to the saga of the emperors (Big mom, Kaido, BB and shanks) and you are wondering who did Oda put in between this time?\nWell, you already know the answer. A Gorosei is on the way (Saturn). Maybe it hints that eventually Luffy will have to face off with the other 4?\n\nI know you already know this obviously, it's just that this pattern seemed curious to me. What do you think?",

        "text": "The thing some people don’t get with Haki is this: \n\nWe learned how Haki works, \n\n• Base arment -&gt; invisible armor to protect your body\n\n• Ryou -&gt; works like an injection to bypass the armor of your opponent (throwing a grenade over the fence)\n\n• ACOC -&gt; Same affect as Ryou but with more damage and extens your invisible armor\n\nTherefore regardless how strong you are physically, your Haki power stays the same. \n\nYour physically power just enables you to over power your opponent, your Haki damage will be the same but additionally you will have more raw power. \n\nThat’s what we saw between Luffy vs Doffy. He could over power him, but his Haki wasn’t stronger. Doffy said, you don’t have enough power to knock me out. Luffy switched to G4 where he has more raw power. \n\nSame as Luffy vs Katakuri, Luffy Haki was weaker but he could over power him to nullify the gap of haki. \n\nThat’s why Luffy could fight in base form against Kaido, since his Haki is the same. When he transformed to G4, Kaido could still overpower him. Same as in G5, Kaido could overpower him but the gap was by a margin. \n\nLuffy in G5 Giant, had more raw strength as Kaido in his dragon form (Kid could also slam Kaido and over power BM in several occasions, but his Haki was to weak to do major damage). \n\nIn conclusion you can over come physically stronger rar power opponents, with stronger Haki. \nBut you can’t over come stronger Haki with physical raw strength before you start to close the Haki power gap. \n\nOr you have a DF like Kid and Law which can bypass Haki.",

My evidence is the fact that Bonny can cause a person to experience alternative future their bodies could theoretically become but don't seem to be where they will end up.\n\nIf she were to combine that ability with her father's ability to seemingly extract memories it could be possible to take a glimpse of the future or futures",

Now compare this to the average World Noble who I think can be accurately described as particularly sadistic spoilt children.\n\nGiven how differently they act compared to the rest of their fellow nobles how do you guys think they feel about the latter? Do you think its a sign that they are more then they seem(I've seen one theory suggest that they are actually robots)?",

Let's get to the meat and potatoes of what's bringing me to post Kaido's crew is named in the same way a deck of cards is : King Queen Jack and numbers at first I didn't see it but I kept thinking about something I saw something somewhere about fictional caracters named Jokers and Doffy's name in the pirate world was Joker and I always wondered why ? Why does this man who's really not a laughing or clown type would call himself joker ? Well turn out he's not Kaido is the one that probably started calling him like this when he started to work with him on the smile production so yeah that's pretty much it the only thing I couldn't see is that there is no Ace in his crew but I guess there is no Ace at all no more....",

        "text": "So, I'm starting to get really sick of Luffy just flat out refusing to develop as a character. The entirety of his character so far has been entirely just eating, fighting, and occasionally friendship. That and getting stuck in stuff. \n\nI just dislike how, whenever there's a big scene where the characters *could* develop, Luffy's nearly always gone. And when he's there, he just *refuses* to develop. Take the scene where Robin explains, to his face, she doesn't want to be part of his crew anymore. Dude just flat out says \"no\", and is currently dragging everyone to rescue her. And that's not saying how he flat out refuses to strategize whatsoever, and actively fucks up everyone else's plans. Im getting really tired of main character shield being the real protagonist. Dude just walks anywhere, screams \"gumgum\" and wins. \n\nIm just genuinely wondering if he actually develops at all over the 1000 or so episode run, or if he's like goku and just sort of doesn't. I mean Goku's a himbo, don't get me wrong, but luffy's just rock stupid from what I've seen so far. Saying he has 1 brain cell is an insult to those with actually 1 brain cell.\n\nIf he does at least sort of develop, let me know when I can expect it, minimal spoilers please. Otherwise, just tell me he doesn't, honestly I wouldn't doubt it at this rate lol",

        "text": "I believe there used to be continents/ much lager islands and chains. I believe the red line A was much smaller/ never there at all. I imagine the original user / owner of the quake fruit using their powers to form a wall in combat or something and was later forced to do the same all around the world. Theres only the one mountain inside the redline that we know of and assuming this was actually a chain that had once partially formed the redline, then it could have been scaped and molded in an unreasonable number of ways. My biggest theory is that its the result of an anchient mechanism that was built and it is currently controled by IM, originally it had infinitly more functiona with the old power vegapunk spoke of and lunarians being able to power such things thatcurrently slaves cant do.  The red line inadvertently created the oceans to rise massivly/ destroy the old world as it was. I really have troubles with why the past users of the quake fruit and so many other power holders havent punched at least holes connecting the oceans or destoryed parts of the granddline. They cant protect all of it constantly i dont think so why",
