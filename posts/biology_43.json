I also bathe everyday so it shouldn't be a hygeine issue.. Additionally, mosquitos just seem to like me way more than anyone else? \n\nFor example, once I was chatting with my friend and I managed to get bitten five times while they only got bitten once, and another time i was with my class on a field trip and even with mosquito coils all around the area and with mosquito repellent sprayed on me I got bitten twice while none of my other classmates got bitten.\n\nSorry if this doesn't fit the sub I don't have anywhere else to ask for help as I am writing this I just got bitten three times I've tried everything I can including insulting the mosquitos and yelling death threats at them please help me",

        "text": "Heya!\n\nFor some context, I graduated from an American university in the Middle East with a BS in Biology (meaning it's accredited and all that). Since I graduated a semester early, I have six months until possibly starting medical school or trying for a master's degree. However, my priority at the moment is to get a job as to me that seems more valuable than either of those things. There's also the caveat of money when it comes to paying for even more education. Also, if I had to choose between med school and a master's, my passion is in biology (hence asking on this subreddit) and I hope to apply to cell biology or biochemistry. For more reference, I got a 521 on the MCAT and a 4.0 GPA. Not much experience in the lab since my country is currently in an economic crisis and thus funding is way down.\n\nThe sort of general consensus I get is that a BS by itself is useless and that I have no other options but to pursue a master's or med school, but I would like to hear more about people's paths into the industry. How you started out, where you ended up, and what exactly is possible for me keeping in mind I don't have any residency in the US/Canada or European countries that have at least some industry related to biology. I have been applying for jobs abroad, but sponsoring a foreign worker when I don't think I bring much to the table at the moment aside from good grades is making me wonder if it's even worth trying.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you guys.",
