        "text": "Science supports the fact that languages are learned via comprehensible input.   \nStephen Krashen's work on this is seminal:  \n[http://www.sdkrashen.com/content/books/sl\\_acquisition\\_and\\_learning.pdf](http://www.sdkrashen.com/content/books/sl_acquisition_and_learning.pdf)\n\n(The following applies to languages with lots of speakers and plenty of content online. If you are trying to learn a minority or endangered language, this advice might not be applicable.)\n\n**What's comprehensible input?** Comprehensible input is when you listen to/watch/read content in your target language which you can completely or mostly understand. After hundreds of hours of content which is comprehensible to you, you will eventually acquire the language. \n\n**What does it mean to \"acquire\" a language?** When you don't understand a language, your brain will work very hard subconsciously to find meaning from context. Given enough time and rest, words and grammar that had no meaning to you before will begin to make sense to you intuitively. After enough exposure, you'll be able to understand and speak the language.\n\n**Can you learn a language from your partner?** Unfortunately, it will be very difficult to learn from a partner even if they are a native speaker unless they can completely immerse you in the language for weeks/months - enough time for you to acquire the basics. You'll have to be comfortable not understanding them most of the time, and you will both need to be very patient.\n\n**How long will it take?** It'll take a long time, but it's quicker depending on how close the language is to any languages you already speak. As an example, the US Foreign Service Institute has guidelines on how long it will take to learn a foreign language via full time coursework if your starting language is English. I find these are also a good rough indication of how long it will take purely through comprehensible input. (Source: [https://www.fsi-language-courses.org/blog/fsi-language-difficulty/](https://www.fsi-language-courses.org/blog/fsi-language-difficulty/) )\n\n* Category I – Languages that usually require around 24-30 weeks or 600-750 class hours. They are the most similar in gammar/vocab to English. This group contains languages like French, Spanish, Romanian and Dutch.\n*  Category II - German - Language that requires around 30 weeks in a category of its own.\n*  Category III – Languages that usually require around 36 weeks or 900 hours of instruction to reach S-3/R-3. These languages are slightly more difficult, and this group includes Indonesian and Swahili.\n*  Category IV – Students usually need around 44 weeks or 1100 class hours to reach S-3/R-3. This is the largest group and contains a wide variety of languages, including Russian, Hindi, Tamil, Thai, Vietnamese, Turkish, Finnish and many more. They are described as “hard languages”.\n*  Category V – It usually takes 88 weeks or 2200 hours to reach S-3/R-3 proficiency in these languages. This small group of “super-hard languages” includes Chinese (Mandarin), Cantonese, Japanese, Korean and Arabic. These languages are the least similar in grammar/vocab to English.\n\n**What if it's too hard?** Take it slow. Remember if you are getting input which you don't understand, it's probably too hard. Try taking a short introductory course (Pimsleur, Assimil, Language Transfer are all good places to start) but start watching/reading easy material as early as you can. Try to progress to harder stuff every now and then. Everyone acquires language at a different pace, but you'll notice you are getting better after only a short amount of time, every week or so you will be able to understand noticeably more and more. Every human has the capacity to learn language, even you.\n\n**Do I need to use flashcards?** Not really. Flash cards and spaced repetition software like Anki can be an efficient way to accelerate your retention of new words if that is your goal, but it's not necessary for language acquisition. High frequency words will appear frequently in your input (funny about that), so you'll learn them quickly and retain them. In this way, input can become its own spaced repetition method. Low frequency words might not appear as often, but you won't need them as often.\n\n**What if I get bored?** Sometimes finding stuff that's interesting in your target language is going to be hard. Try to read books that you know you like, but get the translation in your target language. If you like cars, watch car youtube in your target language. If you like history, watch that. Remember that there's lots of people who speak this language and there's bound to be something that will interest you out on the web.\n\n**Do I need to practice conversations?** Not really. Conversation practice can help your confidence and help you learn set phrases like introductions and how to speak about yourself, but just input is enough to start to be able to produce the language on your own. Eventually you will come across everything you want to say in your exposure to the language through input. After you can produce the language on your own, conversations will help you develop further.\n\nThere's no mega difficult steps to learning a language. There's no final test. Sometimes it's annoying when you don't understand something, and sometimes it's boring, but you will get better. Being comfortable speaking with natives will take a long time. You can speed up the process by spending more time with the language.",

This thing also happens to me sometimes in my mother tongue, where I am instead thinking in English grammar. Another thing that happens in both my languages is that it takes me a bit to think of the word I want to say, so I use filler words like uhh. However, I am not that concerned about it. Still, I have noticed it more recently in my everyday conversations, so I wondered if there were any tips to make my sentences flow better in my languages. I am also currently living in a predominantly English-speaking country, so I believe that plays a part as well.\n\nAppreciate any tips/advice!",

Eventually, I decided to just begin reading and looking up every word I didn't understand and writing them down.\n\nI'm seeing improvement, but it's going slow (faster than when I was trying to pick up the language through listening without understanding, though). Any tips?\n\nI always see people telling me to watch french movies, tv, the news, etc. But my lack of vocab has always meant I never pick any of it up (when I use subtitles, I just read the subtitles). How do people learn vocabulary most effectively?",

I know for a fact that my language abilities have definitely improved and that I have learnt a lot, since when I first arrived, knowing only the basics of french, however, I also feel as if I've almost got worse speaking-wise as I didn't overthink everything I say like I do now. \n\nSome days I feel really good about my learning process, but on others, I feel as if everything I say makes me want to crawl into a hole and cringe. Sometimes I feel I can understand everything, others, nothing at all. I often pretend to the family I'm tired and I'm not listening in order to get out of the fact I don't have the confidence to strike up a conversation and talk. I often don't participate out of sheer nervousness, which I know I shouldn't be, but for example, three times this evening they asked me if I understood what they were saying and to that, I was wrong every time. \n\nThe children I'm au pairing for can also make me feel embarrassed, they're often not very nice to me/ignore me when we're together and really make me feel down about my speaking abilities. I do understand it can't be easy for them when there is a language barrier but I do try my best. \n\nIt's hard not to feel stupid and low, especially as I spend so long learning grammar every day, and listening intensely every mealtime with the family. I feel as if people are judging me at how little I know and that I haven't progressed yet, as I can barely get my words out most of the time. \n\nI'm just writing this for some advice as to what I could do to help myself, people's journeys on learning a language- particularly while abroad, and whether this is normal, I'm here until April and my biggest fear is that I'll still be feeling this way then.",

        "text": "The worst thing about Anki is creating cards. Also, reviewing those cards.  Hell, everything about Anki is painful, but it's an absurdly effective tool if you can stomach the grind. And while I use extensions like Migaku and Language Tools to help me eliminate some of the annoyances of generating cards, using the artificial intelligence known as ChatGPT is a game changer.  You can easily open up a spreadsheet and within 30 minutes create enough cards to last you months. And what's awesome is that ChatGPT can make those cards highly specific to your needs (i.e. deliberate practice--where you develop exercises that target your weaknesses).\n\n**Putting ChatGPT to the test:**\n\nI asked ChatGPT to do the following for me.\n\n* Create Spanish sentences that use the phrase \"No es que\"\n*  Explain to me the meaning of the word mamón in Spanish and provide me 3 examples\n*  Create me a list of the top 10 slang words used in Venezuela and provide me an example sentence of each \n* Create 10 sentences that begin with the word \"De\" Create 10 Spanish sentences that use low frequency words\n*  Create me a list of 10 Spanish sentences that make use of words related to personal finance Create 20 Spanish sentences that use the phrase \"o sea\"  (a filler word in Spanish) but do not start the sentence with it.  I then asked it to translate those sentences into English but translate \"o sea\" as \"I mean.\" \n* Generate 50 sentences that utilize ustedes and the imperative and are things a teacher would say to students. \n* Create 20 sentences that use the subjunctive and refer to raising children \n* Create a list of 30 Spanish phrases related to the economy \n* Create 10 sentences in Spanish about Flat Earthers and conspiracy theories\n\nAnd here's the thing … it fucking worked.  Like really, really, well. My Spanish is good enough that I could read over the sentences it generated and compare them to the English translations and there was nothing that felt out of place.  For extra assurance I sent a lot of what it generated to my Spanish tutor to double-check and while she had quibbles about how it defined the slang term \"mamón\" there wasn't any sentence she identified as sounding unnatural.\n\n**Failures**: The only time ChatGPT failed me is then I asked me to create a list of sentences using a bad word in Spanish, \"chingada.\" It refused to do so.  It also wouldn't generate 200 sentences for me because it would take too long.  Also, occasionally it would stop generating sentences on me and I'd have to restart my browser to get consistent performance.  Finally, sometimes when I asked it to generate sentences using usted or the subjunctive it would over rely on some of the same verbs and make sentences that were slight variations of each other.  Most of the errors were my own, since it took me awhile to learn how to word specifically what I wanted it to do.\n\n**Editing Issues**: Sometimes CHATGPT would include the English translation immediately after the Spanish sentence. You can ask it not to do that if you need to copy and paste into a spreadsheet.  You can also ask it to eliminate line breaks, or ask it for a very specific formatting.\n\nHow can language learners use this? Based on the examples of the prompts I threw at it I think it's clear that you could quickly create Anki decks that meet highly specific needs.\n\n* You could generate sentences that make uses of specific language patterns or tenses so you can boost your comprehension/production of those patterns. \n* You could ask it to generate relevant vocabulary on a topic so that you could prepare yourself to discuss an issue in advance. You can also ask for phrases if you prefer language \"chunks\" to isolated words \n* You could use it in conjunction with a tutoring sessions--any words/phrases that you learn in a lesson you could write down and then later have CHATGPT generate dozens of example sentences using them.\n* You could ask it to create sentences that you're likely to encounter in a specific setting or context (the airport, or a doctor's office, whatever)\n\nIf you're not sure how to transfer these sentences into Anki, it's pretty simple. Open a spreadsheet program and put target language sentence into one column and the translations into the column next to it.  Save it as a CSV and then go to Anki and import the file.",

The concept of extensive reading (from my understanding) is that learning words in as many contexts as possible can lead to more efficient learning.\n\nSo, I thought if I can make many stories with many different combinations of words I want to acquire, I can learn the language faster.\n\nThen, I asked chat GPT to make stories with words I wanted to memorize. And it made a good story. (My TL is English) I imported that story to a language learning app LngQ so that I can get an audio version of that story and I can listen to it. \n\nI think it’s cool and it’s seemingly useful, but I am not sure because I don’t really know how extensive reading works.\n\nAm I missing something with this method?",

I'd probably rate myself a borderline A2/low B1 now, maybe a little better at reading.\n\nI'm a heritage speaker of Arabic, and now very focused on improving my dialect and learning the written language to a high level. Learning Arabic has made me think about French again, and languages I would love to learn in the future so I can read my favorite translated novels in their original languages. My question is, what are some low stakes strategies I can use to engage my French again and keep it a little more fresh/make slow progress while still maintaining a primary focus on Arabic for the time being?",

Occasionally, they will stumble on a beginner who tries to speak with them and they will say \"you are good, you speak it very well\", but of course it's just courtesy words.",

I actually find the grammar fairly consistent and the inflections make both languages really fun because of the various word order possibilities. I like that verbs change based on the speaker, it definitely gives a bit of a agglutinative to both languages and it makes it so easy to know who is speaking, and you can present more information in a shorter amount of words than in English.\n\nI just find it interesting because a lot of people online (and Polish people in real life) always talk about how difficult it is and it makes me wonder if this brings some sort of pride to Slaves ahaha.",

Unfortunately they lack functionalities that I loved in the Podcast Addict.\n\nI added 4 screenshots to show you what I’m looking for:  \n\\- elaborated listening stats. Here I can see my listening time for every year and for every podcast separately.  \n\\- option to choose a language when looking for a new podcast. Here it’s easily accessible from the search view and you can mark your favourite languages.  \n\\- categories divided into more specific ones. In the games category example you can see some subcategories (least important)  \n\n\nIn those 3 iOS apps I mentioned earlier I found that:  \n\\- Only pocket cast has stats, but it’s only a general one - total time you spend listening to podcasts.  \n\\- Pocket cast and Castro have region selection available. In Overcast I couldn’t find a way to show podcasts in a specific language.  \n\n\nI wonder if you know any app that is similar to Podcast Addict.

I love that I don't have to use my hands or look at a screen.\n\nIs there another app like that? (Ideally for Mandarin, but just curious in general)",
