        "text": " According to a report by Jim, unit sales of print books have had their worst week so far in 2023, with sales dropping 8.8% from a year ago. Sales fell in all categories except for adult fiction, which saw a rise of 2.7%.\n\nBoth juvenile fiction and nonfiction categories had a decline in sales of 15.3%. Little Blue Truck’s Valentine by Alice Schertle and You're My Little Cuddle Bug by Nicola Edwards were the top two sellers in juvenile fiction, but their sales were lower than last year's bestsellers. The two titles leading juvenile nonfiction, Pop-Up Peekaboo! and Baby Touch and Feel I Love You, also saw a decline in sales from last year.\n\nSales of adult nonfiction declined 10.6% compared to last year, but The Official Disney Parks Cookbook by Pam Brandon was the bestselling new release in this category. Adult fiction sales rose 2.7%, with Colleen Hoover titles occupying the first four spots on the category list.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether this trend will continue, but these sales figures are a reflection of the changing reading habits and preferences of consumers.",

        "text": "By \"subtle\" I mean one that you think very few people, if any, would catch.  That could be for a number of reasons.  Perhaps the way it's presented is very off-hand (some others like to \"hide\" allusions, others like to knock you over the head with them).  Or maybe it's referring to a work that few people would have read, or a passage in a well-known work that isn't often quoted.  \n  \nI'll give you the one I'm thinking of as an example.  \n  \nIn the book \"Little, Big\" by John Crowley, the main character (at the time) receives a gift of a hat.  The paragraph reads:  \n  \n&gt; \"What more?\" Mr. Woods said, looking around him, finger to his lips.  Mrs. Underhill with one of her needles pointed to a round leather box on top of the cupboard.  \nRight! Mr. Woods said.  \"How about this?\"  He finger the box from its high place until it fell into his arms.  He popped open the lid.  \"A hat!\"  \nIt was a red hat, high-crowned and soft, belted with a little plaited belt in which a white owl's feather nodded.  Mr. Woods and Mrs. Underhill said Aaaaah, and watched closely as Mr. Woods fitted it to Smokey's head.  ...  \n  \nI'm spoiler-izing the following few lines so I don't ruin the book for anyone (plus you can make your guess and see if you're right!)  \n\nIf you need a little hint: &gt;!The book is subtitled \"or, The Fairies' Parliament\"!&lt;\n\n&gt;!The paragraph I quoted is referring to a poem called \"The Fairies,\" by William Allingham.  It starts with:!&lt;  \n&gt;!Up the airy mountain,!&lt;  \n&gt;!Down the rushy glen,!&lt;  \n&gt;!We daren’t go a-hunting!&lt;  \n&gt;!For fear of little men;!&lt;  \n&gt;!Wee folk, good folk,!&lt;  \n&gt;!Trooping all together;!&lt;  \n&gt;!Green jacket, __red cap__,!&lt;  \n&gt;!And __white owl’s feather__!!**&lt;  \n&gt;![LINK TO FULL POEM](https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/16839/pg16839-images.html#THE_FAIRIES)!&lt;\n\nSubtle?  Or am I underestimating the number of people who would catch this reference?  I'm 100% sure this is an allusion to the work I mentioned because the 6th line quoted above is used in a completely off-hand manner in another of the Author's books.  \n  \nNOTE: This is a do-over.  The first time I submitted this, I had issues using the spoiler tags.",

Each female has a different kill set. I remember in the first book the female had a talent for guns and another female had a talent for bows and arrows and another female for knives and swords. I think there are four girls in total and each has their own book. All four of these girls were kidnapped and they were all in a room together with another girl who got killed. They each trained, fought, and killed for their kidnappers until one day they escaped. Also, their love interests are all friends and I think all the men are mercenaries/killers. The fifth girl, in the beginning, was crying and loud and had to take a punishment.  I don’t remember a lot but I think one of the girls had to kill the fifth girl. Each book starts off with them kidnapped in that room with the fifth girl dying but from their POV and what they thought of it. The girl who excelled in swords was tied up because she got in trouble a lot and the girl who excelled with bow and arrows was called wise a lot even though she was younger I also think she was a killer before she got kidnapped or she trained, I don’t remember. \n\nDoes anyone have an idea of what I’m talking about and what’s the book title and author?

They’re so intimate. At small parties there isn’t any privacy.”* \n\n *“You see I usually find myself among strangers because I drift here and there trying to forget the sad things that happened to me.”* \n\n *“There are only the pursued, the pursuing, the busy and the tired.”* \n\n *“No amount of fire or freshness can challenge what a man will store up in his ghostly heart.”*",

It’s fascinating to find books outside of your usual realm that make you question why you have those preferences in the first place.\n\nA book I read last year that I absolutely loved was Uneasy Street: The Anxieties of Affluence. The author, Rachel Sherman, is a sociology prof at the New School. She interviews a broad swath of the very wealthy living in NYC (a mix of earners and inheritors, incomes typically in the millions).\n\nHer observation is that many conflicts that come with wealth are ‘conflicts about how to be both wealthy and morally worthy’, particularly at a time of unprecedented inequality. Topics ranged from the cultural legitimacy of the middle class, to normalization of affluence, to separating identity from purchase behavior.\n\nI was totally sucked in, perhaps in a voyeur-istic way (very similar to the array of ‘the super wealthy suck’ stories that have been popular in TV and movies this year) to her persona-building. She doesn’t paint her subjects as silly rich people, but as complex people who want the best for themselves and their families, using this desire for good to ignore many of the harmful ways they inhibit society. Of course, her interviewees range in their consciousness about their place in society.\n\nEven cooler is that Such a Fun Age by Kiley Reid, one of my most-recommended books, gives a shout out to Uneasy Street before the story starts! Reid said it was very informative to how she wrote wealthy, well-meaning, but harmful, characters. Very cool to see how nonfiction can so directly inform powerful fiction writing.\n\nWould love to hear from fiction lovers what nonfiction books have a place in their heart!",

What are some of your favorite characters, parts or quotes? Which parts did you find confusing?\n2. How do the descriptions of the voices of different characters provide insight into their personality or how Adunni sees them? How does it relate to \"the louding voice?\"\n3. How does the author criticize Nigerian society through Adunni's eyes and narration?\n4. What does Ms Tia's advice to Adunni reveal about her biases or understanding of Nigeria? What words of wisdom would you give to Adunni in her position?\n5. What other questions or predictions do you have moving forward and what do you hope to see? Which unanswered questions are the most interesting to you?\n\nReminder that the fourth and final discussion will be posted on Friday, February 24th and will cover up everything in the book.

        "text": "American Psycho is commonly seen as just a sigma male movie without any real depth but it is somewhat deep and I believe that the book portrays that better. Patrick Bateman’s character is used as a satire comment on how often times men will be shallow. Throughout a majority of the book Patrick Bateman’s thoughts are about his desires such as wealth, music, porn, sex, and his physical appearance (including the appearances of others). Patrick and his friends sees themselves as better than those lesser than him which shows how big his ego, again tying into his shallowness. \n\nThe fan base for the movie doesn’t see the satire of American Psycho with many of its young male fans being an example of what Bret Easton Ellis was making a commentary on with Patrick Bateman’s personality and character as a whole. On Tik Tok and Instagram there are so many edits and fans that almost idolize Patrick Bateman because of his ego because of his wealth, physical appearance, and how he pulls bitches (gets women to sleep with him). The exact thing that Bret Easton Ellis was using to poke fun at men is the reason why so many male fans idolize and love Patrick Bateman.\n\nYou might be asking yourself “Okay? Why not put this on a subreddit about movies?” and that’s simple because the book often has so many pages just dedicated to describes clothes or music. The book is meant to be boring which again ties into how shallow the character is. I think that if these fans that show the irony of the book read it they wouldn’t be able to finish it because it isn’t as interesting as the movie. \n\nRandom note: I’m reading Lolita and the way Humbert will describe girls and women reminds me of Patrick Bateman.",

Its called A Movement Tourist: Perspectives On Enjoying Movement And Physical Exercise by Omer S. Even from the get go of the foreword (formally known in the book as the fiveword). It kicks off with humour and starts the premise of the book. The whole concept is basically to provide a different view on movement in general and not just exercise. Finding ways to make it fun, enjoyable and worth while. Its split into 8 different concepts surrounding movement with my favourite chapter being movement as a therapy. It has helped me engage with doing small physical things in my life that I would normally not really care about. Such as when walking to the shop, taking little detours to make the walk a little longer and maybe see areas of where I live that I have never done so before (I found a really lovely canal to walk alongside!). I don't feel challenged to compete with myself to exercise as much as I did now, and in fact I'm now exercising more without thinking of it as such. Im doing it for fun now, now to be in shape, and its great. So thank you Omer, for providing this book and your insights, and to anyone who wishes to give it a read, I do highly recommend it. Its wonderful.",

        "text": "Hello lovely readers!\n\nI’m an ESL teacher in Taiwan. I want to start a semester long project for my school where teachers are given a book to read to the children, with the aim of sparking a passion for reading in at least some of the students. I was thinking it would be 5- 10 minutes of reading each class with the aim of completing within 20-30 lessons, if possible. \n\nI’m looking for recommendations for books for grades 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. If you have any ideas please send them through and do please note which grade the book you are recommending would be for. \n\nThank you ever so much for your help!",
