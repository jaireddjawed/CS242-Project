I also use a v60 (do I need to say filter blends work well in that?), and acquired an aeropress last weekend and have been taking it into work.\n\nThe recipe I‚Äôm using I would say gives me a result that‚Äôs a middle ground between a filter coffee and a moka brew, and I‚Äôm enjoying the results thus far.\n\nI‚Äôve also been buying more from Square Mile and Friedhats which tend to specify espresso or filter on the packs.\n\nSo two questions:\n\n1) how do roasters differentiate between espresso and filter blends (more so I know what to look out for from roasters who don‚Äôt)\n\n2) would you lean more towards espresso roast or filter roast given the result I‚Äôve been getting from the aeropress? \n\nCheers :)\n\n*as a side note, I have a preference for berry flavours that are on the more savoury side, but like exploring all flavours in the light roast realm",

Tried the daily question thread but to no avail :'(\n\nWhen frothing my oat milk, it seems to froth up heavily before it gets warm. My resulting cappuccinos/lattes are practically room temperature, maybe even lower. \n\nI'm using a SMEG, with one of those metal cylindrical frothers on the side. Yes, I know, but it was a present from my mum before I got really into it so am giving it the best chance I can. \n\nThe temperature was fine in my old pitcher but I've recently downsized to a 12oz and only froth 150ml at a time to reduce waste.\n\nThe technique I use is to dip the wand in ever so slightly and tilt the pitcher sideways to get the whirlpool before dropping it down further after I have the consistency I'm aiming for.\n\nDoes anyone know why this could be happening? I have a feeling it's the wand and I'm looking to purchase a proper one to mod the machine, but want to make sure that's the case before doing so. Might even consider another machine if that's the only fix because I'm getting really serious about it now, but like I mentioned above, want to give my current one the best chance of success. \n\nThanks!",

Yes, I get that each roaster has their overhead especially if they have a store.... but still that differential is quite large. \n\nIs there such a thing as low quality green bean imports?

If I leave the hot plate on and there's not a lot of coffee in the carafe, it'll be burnt; if the hot plate is off, then the coffee just seems to lose all of its flavor. \n\nNow here's the confounding factor: I do have to put the coffee in the microwave to reheat it. If I do this to the coffee in my mug that I poured fresh, it will usually still taste decent unless either 1) I reheat it too long or too many times (twice seems to be the maximum) or 2) I let the coffee get ice cold and sit for maybe forty-five minutes. \n\nIf I reheat a mug of coffee poured from a 30-minute to one-hour old pot, it will almost invariably taste flavorless and/or horrible. \n\nIs this a placebo effect you think, where I'm assuming the coffee is going to be bad because it was brewed during the Jurassic era, or does coffee go \"flat\" that quickly? \n\nThanks for any input!",

        "text": "Hey all, so I‚Äôve been trying my darnedest to get proficient with the V60 since I got it for Xmas, with some decent results. I‚Äôve been brewing 2-3 cups a day with it exclusively and for the most part really love it. The whole process is just fun to me- the equipment, the bloom, the aromas, the pours, and obviously drinking the coffee. Sometimes I wake up a bit early and can‚Äôt fall back sleep cause I‚Äôm too excited to make coffee üòÇ\n\nI started with the standard (older) Hoffmann method but quickly moved to his newer 1 cup 5 pour method once I got the hang of pouring consistently with my gooseneck kettle without sputtering the stream. I‚Äôd say I‚Äôm getting a great cup 1 out of every 3 tries or so even though I‚Äôm doing the exact same thing every time. I do pours as low over the v60 as possible, starting in the center and gradually circling out not quite to the edge and then back to the middle. Everything is the exact same, brew time is basically the same for each cup when using the same beans, but each cup tastes a bit different. None of them taste particularly bad- all are smooth and enjoyable, but 1 out of every 3 cups or so really sticks out as great where the tasting notes really pop.\n\nSo it got me thinking- I live in Colorado where water boils at 202F, and my favorite coffees are the really fruity floral light roasts- especially natural processed or extended fermentation coffees, as well as Ethiopians. The general consensus seems to be to use as hot of water as possible for these types of coffees so I‚Äôm obviously at a bit of a disadvantage there. I try to really thoroughly preheat the mug and V60 by pouring a good bit of water through the V60 and filter into the mug, swirling till the whole mug is warm, and then pouring back through the V60 one more time.\n\nSo from what I can think of and from what I‚Äôve found online, I have a few different options to try to compensate for the lower brew temp:\n\n-Grind finer for more extraction since the water is lower temp\n\n-Agitate as much as possible to maximize extraction \n\n-use slower filter papers to increase drawdown and extraction\n\n-use a different brewer such as the Kalita Wave or Hario switch for a slower drawdown and hopefully more consistent/ repeatable results (although the need to thoroughly preheat something like the Kalita could be a potential inconsistent variable that could negatively affect an already low brew temp)\n\nI would love to hear from anyone that has experience with light roast pour overs at elevation and what has worked best for them, or anyone‚Äôs thoughts on it in general. I‚Äôm using a heptagonal 1zpresso Q2 (with a ZP6 on the way), a temp controlled gooseneck, and a plastic v60 with cafec abaca filters.\n\nTL,DR- what‚Äôs the best way to brew light roast pour overs at elevation? üòÇüò¨‚ò∫Ô∏è",

But today in my 1st block, there was a coffee machine, so I made my own cup of coffee (with permission, of course). I tried it black at first. It was bitter (probably like it was supposed to be). I kinda felt like i wouldn't be able to finish it without putting something in it first. So i put in some coffee creamer (liquid). I  put in 3 pumps and it still didn't affect anything besides the color, so I went for some powdered coffee creamer that happened to be sitting next to the liquid creamer. I put in just enough for the coffee to be sweet to the point where it was tolerable (for a first-timer). I didn't put in as much as i truly wanted to, but I'm pretty sure that didn't really matter much, especially because at the point where there was probably ¬º the original amount left, my energy just suddenly shot through the roof. I felt like I could physically do things that were literally impossible (like flying or just straight up transcending into the 7th dimension). I might as well've gotten high off of that coffee. When I fineshed the cup, I was somewhat jittery.

        "text": "Hi, fellow coffee lovers. Already for a few months I've been posed with a question of starting upgrading my gear and getting into new methods and whatnot. \n\nSo about a year ago I bought my first grinder, the trusty Timemore C2, because at that moment it was the cheapest and the most readily available option for me, and what I understood from endless reddit and youtube browsing ‚Äì it's a pretty decent grinder. For now it makes the job done and the coffee brewed, sometimes even very successfully so. But as any enthusiast I've started thinking if there's more to it. So I came here to ask ‚Äì is it worth upgrading? \n\nMy primary (frankly, only) method for now is the Aeropress, but in the future I'd wanna get into both V60 and espresso (probably some kind of manual lever machine like the Flair). I've done a bit of research, and it seems that the best option for me would be something of 1Zpresso (although I still can't make anything off their massive lineup and what grinder exactly do I need), because it has models which are kind of jack-of-all-trades in terms of brew methods, they have really good reviews, they are reasonably priced and they are (at least some of them) available for me. \n\nThe thing is, most of the hand grinder reviews for some reason omit the Timemore C2 (however I've heard people say both good and bad things about it), so I have no real way to compare it to the 1zpresso's or any other grinders. Maybe some of you took the same path and can share their experiences ‚Äì is the upgrade needed and am I missing out on something better while still using the C2?",

Ava Roasteria in Beaverton doesn't have it, nor does See See in Beaverton just a few blocks away. Lionheart Coffee, another coffee shop just a few blocks from Ava doesn't have it either, but they also scammed me when I asked for my money back. I told the barista it was too watered down and he quickly says \"oh, well I can have a shot of espresso added to it\". I'm wanting my money back but when he says this I say \" ok\". It was STILL too watery, and I am still wanting my money back. I tell him again and he says he'll have a second shot added. Again I reluctantly say \"ok\", realizing this guy is just NOT GOING TO refund my money. IT WAS STILL TOO WATERED DOWN!!!!! I just give up because I notice the barista was just dripping some hot water over the espresso, not even preparing it correctly. This was months ago and I have never even considered going back. Two convenience stores, one that supposedly sells Peets Coffee even, both have the same awful \" coffee\". This is just Beaverton. Java Man, Golden Lotus, St Honore Boulangerie, and Peets in downtown Portland all have this awful \"coffee\" too. Two other Peets locations in Tualatin and Portland are the same. Is there ANYWHERE in the Portland area that you can get GOOD coffee? The Ava Roasted is even \"roasts\" their own beans, you can watch them do it through the window. I used to work at Coffee Bean International and know what roasted beans look like. You can see oil in the beans, they aren't the color of of Ava's, and they are WHOLE beans, not all halved and in pieces. WHERE are they getting these from even? Different types of coffee smell different too. Every place I have been it is always that same smell, like the air outside but stronger. WTF??? I have a weird sounding but possibly legit excuse for this \"coffee\". I think maybe whoever supplies these beans to these coffee shops is removing the oils for K-cups, then passing on what is left to them. The same thing is happening at the marijuana dispensaries, they remove what is good and then sell it anyway. Leaving you with a product that doesn,'t even get you \" high\". The Portland area was awful enough already, but since about this time last year there is even good coffee or good LEGAL marijuana. No wonder I am so frustrated.",

        "text": "Hello fellow coffee lovers! \nI've recently gotten into brewing aeropress and I dare say I'm pretty good at it.. but like on a basic level. \nI'm not doing anything wrong anymore, and as a barista I know how to use time, temperature and grind to make it more enjoyable for my personal tastes. I've always liked testing recipes from various world championships, however I'm not looking for quite that. I just want to make my coffee taste more unique, to learn how to change not so obvious aspects of taste and flavour by doing something else. Like maybe you have your preferred way of swirling your aeropress so it's \"better\"? Or do you do it with a spoon? What small actions can affect my brew and how?",

I grind so fine with the James Hoffman technique where it literally looks like espresso grind and I‚Äôve never had such clarity in a cup and barely any fines which stick to the sides. \n\nI used a baratza encore while visiting my parents and the difference is astounding. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I would get good cups with the baratza but the susceptibility of choking the filter and finer settings is much higher. \n\nIf anyone has a baratza encore, and is questioning to upgrade. Try the jx pro , I finally make equal if not better coffee than a lot of third wave cafes. (Maybe because I can tune It to my taste as well). Just to add, I was unable to reach that cafe clarity with the encore. \n\nNOTE: my conclusion was based off of use of Third wave water , gooseneck kettle, temp probe and digital scale. I cannot attest to the difference if the same factors are not kept the same (especially the water, water makes it essentially to get cafe quality coffee). \n\nHope this post helps and doesn‚Äôt sound too pretentious lmao!",

        "text": "I have som pretty good quality beans (medium roasted) with a fruity character.\n\nMy brewing method has been Aeropress, with the optimal instructions taken from James Hoffman, yet it has come out as sour, so I decided to switch back to the Moccamaster, lo and behold: still sour.\n\nFor the Aeropress I've had on the finer end of the filter setting (on my Wilfa Svart grinder) and water at around 90 degrees celsius. Between 15-20 grams of coffe for 200 grams of water.\n\nFor the Moccamaster, the recomended 60 grams of coffe for one liter of water. \n\nI should also add  that I had to freeze the beans due to me being the only coffe drinker in my house. I heard that it shouldn't matter though.\n\nThank you in advance &lt;3",

Additionally, how many clicks do I use with a Comandante C40, I‚Äôve heard some people say 28-32. Thanks in advance!",

For me the best case scenario is to make a 60ml concentrated coffee shot and add it to my sweetened whole milk cup to get that next level experience rather than adding instant coffee \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is the best way for this? Hoffman said grind your own coffee beans so should I get a manual grinder, and then Hoffman also had a video about using an inverted Aeropress to make an espresso, so should I use that or a cheap espresso machine?",
