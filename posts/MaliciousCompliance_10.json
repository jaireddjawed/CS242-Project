        "text": "Hello everyone, this is my first post here and wanted to share my greatest work story. My native language isn't English, so please excuse when my grammar is a bit simple.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe story beginning with me and my company, I'm a 30-year-old businesswoman who works in an IT service in a bank space. I'm the girl for everything basically, but I'm specialist for first level support, administration and backup, sometimes even networking.\n\nEven when I'm not head of my it department, I'm basically had all the responsibilities of them, but unfortunately my pay grade doesn't reflect that at all. I think of my Boss of my IT department as kinda lazy if not incompetent, he even brags about getting so much money for basically doing nothing.\n\nI have a 40-hour week, but since the whole IT department is my responsibility I need to keep track of the servers and maybe problems that can occur 24/7, this is mostly done via emails. When the server status gives out a warning or a failure, I will get notified, and then I'm fixing the problem over remote desktop or going to the company itself (even in my free time). I wouldn't mind this, but I'm not getting paid for this, but on the other hand, I'm getting punished when something is going wrong.\n\nMy Bosses Boss wasn't that much better. Since it was a fancy Bank, everyone should be in a suit the whole time, to let it look professional, best with a skirt and high heels. Only problem is when you work in the first level support  you need to do a lot of \"behind the scenes\" work, like slipping under the desk to do or repair cable management, doing work on the server rack and doing lots of other activities that makes you dirty. You can imagine that this worn out my business clothes really, really fast and not only that, they were so impractical and really made my work harder. So I changed my clothes to a comfy Hoody and work pants to fit the work I'm doing a bit better. When my Boss saw me, he was furious, demanded I can't look like \"a poor hobo\" inside his bank. I told him that I demand work clothes for both occasions because they are expensive and gets worn out quickly. He refused and I wasn't really happy about this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo this, so much for the instruction.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSomeday, my Bosses Boss (head of the whole company) called me.\n\nHe had a plan. He wanted to create \"quiet hours\", means he didn't want his employees working on weekends to let them rest properly. *(At first glance, you could say : Hey, that's a nice idea. Yeah.... no, he just didn't like to pay them for overwork, because he got in some legal trouble with overwork paying in general. Not only that, some employees have strict deadlines and need the extra time to get work done.)*\n\nTo actively ensure nobody can't work over the weekend, he wanted the following : \"Please make sure NO ONE can access their emails and remote desktop over the weekend, no exceptions!\"\n\nSince we had a ticket system and be able to attach emails to tickets, I ask him to write and official work task. *(this has two reasons. First, I like everything documented. Second, I have a something to protect and secure myself if the task I was giving is incorrect. And it's exactly this that saved me)*\n\nSo I was in my office desk again, thinking how to get the task done and what implication it will have and then... it was clear to me what it meant!\n\nThe email came from my Boss with the Task and indeed he wrote :  \"for EVERYONE, NO EXCEPTIONS\". \n\nI was thinking to myself : Should I write them, the implications it would have? After thinking, I thought of how I am treated as a worker and I... decided against it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was working immediately at this task and made an automated process to block every access to emails after Friday 6PM to Monday 6AM.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWeekend came, and it was Saturday, and I was calm relaxed because if you have not noticed by now, by cutting down EVERYONE's emails, means of course... that I don't receive any updates on the Servers. I can't possibly work on it because my remote access is also cut, of course. *(IF you think : You could forward your work email address to your private address, no I can't because we have a very strict data protection. Nothing is allowed to go out.)* I'm happy!\n\nIt's still Saturday, middle of the day, I'm cooking myself and my husband a nice meal and my telephone rings, it's my Bosses Boss! \n\nHe talks with a stressed voice and told me that he can't access his emails. I needed a second to process this, but I responded : \"That doesn't surprise me at all, since you ordered me to cut EVERYONE's email access, without exceptions\". He was angry, very angry, and told me that this obviously doesn't count for him. I told him that he specifically told me that they are NO exceptions, and he stated EVERYONE. He then argued that this wasn't how he phrased it, so I reread him his own email. After that, he was silent for a moment. He noticed his flaw in his logic. I broke the silence and ask him : \"Sir, if you still want access to your emails on the weekend, that's no problem, please send me a request per email and I work on first thing on Monday.\" A bit angry again, he replied that he wants to have it done immediately, and I calmly explained to him that I can't do this, since my remote access is also blocked, like he ordered. He hanged up...\n\n10 minutes later, he calls me again. He asks me calmly if I can fix the problem right now when he pays me for my overwork. He also wants me to be available at any time (means I should receive my emails and be able to remote work)  and that this will raise my pay grade by a lot. I thought that this is the perfect opportunity. I agree to that condition and pay raise, but only when my coworkers and I finally get work clothes. He agreed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSince then my work situation drastically improved and mostly only because I Maliciously complied, well aware of the consequences of the given task.\n\nThanks for reading!",

        "text": "For context, I have relatively strict parents. \n\n* My parents are the worst at parenting and cannot admit they're wrong even though the explanation consists of simple logic to understand. The result of that is my little brother, cannot accept that I have something he doesn't, everything should be equal no matter what, if told to do something simple like keep the plates back in the kitchen or say sorry will not corporate and throw a tantrum. I think you get it by now. (all of this happened before)\n\nYesterday I got shouted at for \"locking\" my door and not responding to them calling me. Like any other child, I argued back and that resulted in my door being locked to my room and their rule of \n\n**\"You are not allowed to go upstairs unless you're going to sleep\"**\n\nOh, that's all? okay!\n\nnot even a minute later my little brother comes down and asked me to come upstairs because he is scared to be in the room alone. We share one room. I told him I can't accompany him as I will get yelled at for going upstairs unless I'm about to sleep. He turned to my mom and asked her to come with him. My mom yelled at me to take him upstairs, I looked back at her and said the same thing I told him. She started ranting about how I shouldn't have slept during the afternoon and that she won't be able to sleep because of me. I told her that I never said I won't go to sleep. She didn't like that one bit. She asked me will I at least help her with dusting upstairs. I told her the same excuse with fake tears and said that my room was locked. She started mumbling that no one ever helps her around the house. I eventually went upstairs and put my brother to bed and watched my phone and waited for her to get upstairs. When she did, my room was locked and she struggled to find the key my dad hid. it was amusing to listen to her struggle to follow a rule that both of them made up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe next day my room was unlocked and I have tuition at 11. I finished my breakfast and sat there watching the tv instead of waiting for the computer to on and getting ready. My mom just stared at me and asked why I was not sitting for tuition. I told her with the same fake tears that I can't do that as my dad will yell if I don't respond in the middle. She said that she will take the blame for it and talk to him about this rule. right now I'm in tuition and they haven't called me once. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nmoral of the story: Don't enforce a rule irrationally",

        "text": "**182:1 high vote! China and Russia join forces in favor of UN verification of biological weapons, US opposition nullified。** The last thing the U.S. government wants to see has happened. Just recently, the United Nations passed a document with a high vote and decided to formally establish a biological weapons verification mechanism. We don't need to say more about who it is aimed at. This time, only one country in the world voted against it, that is, the United States, and even its hardcore allies voted for it. Up to now, it has been three years since the COVID-19 outbreak. In the past three years, the world economy has suffered heavy losses. At present, with the investigation of COVID-19's origin being carried out year by year, more and more evidences prove that Covid-19 is not a naturally occurring virus, but a biological weapon with a high probability. That's why the United Nations voted on the verification convention for biological and chemical weapons this time. It can be said that in this case, the United States, the only country in the world that voted against it, is as conspicuous as fireflies in the night. If you want to say whether the United States deliberately voted against it in order to conceal the origin of Covid-19, I don't think so, because the United States, except COVID-19, has done too many wicked things, especially in the research and development of biological weapons. Japanese are not as wicked as Americans. The most famous example is that after the end of World War II, in order to detect the country's biological and chemical weapons defense capabilities, decided to test the threat of biological and chemical weapons themselves. At the same time, in order to achieve the most realistic effect, the American experiments were conducted in real American cities and on thousands of ordinary Americans! They sent a cruise ship with the virus into San Francisco, and it took only one day to infect all the residents of the city. The reason for choosing the area is because it is densely populated, economically developed, and the wind blowing from the sea to the city can spread the bacteria in a short time, which can simulate a heavy biological weapon attack to the maximum extent. During the week, the U.S. military kept spraying the virus, from the length of spraying, temperature, wind direction, wind speed, air humidity, as well as infected with this bacteria soil, water bodies, and even crowds were recorded in relation to this experiment, due to the U.S. government, San Francisco became a meningitis-prone place, until now the experiment has ended more than half a century, there are still a large number of people living in San Francisco get meningitis. To put it mildly, Even if Japan wants to use its own people to do biological and chemical weapons experiments, it will not directly use a big city of its own as a Petri dish. It is understood that U.S. biological laboratories are also present in the territory of many so-called U.S. allied countries, and there are already 26 U.S.-recognized biological laboratories in Ukraine alone, which is in the midst of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. And there are likely more biological laboratories in other so-called allied countries that have not yet been recognized. There has been no official U.S. recognition of this dangerous behavior. America's behavior has become a global security risk, even as dangerous as Japan's nuclear wastewater discharge, which is destroying the future of mankind. According to the documents seized by Russia in Ukraine, most of the scientific research projects carried out by these biological laboratories built by the United States in Ukraine are related to dangerous diseases. Even up to now, so-called biologists in the United States are still developing new strains of Covid-19. And the United States' repeated rejection of the Biological Weapons Convention sends a signal to the outside world that we are developing biological and chemical weapons. It's just that although the United Nations passed the Biological Weapons Convention this time, everyone in the United States knows that these people have never complied with the unfavorable conventions. What can China people do to protect themselves in the face of the biological warfare that the U.S. government has no moral integrity, no lower limit and no bottom line? In fact, as early as the period of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, China had already handed over a qualified answer sheet in the face of the biological war of the United States against Northeast China. Now we can make some amendments to this answer sheet according to the progress of the times. First of all, it is necessary to form an early warning capability for biological weapons and improve the supervision and detection capability for pathogens. And then also to work with international CDC organizations to be the first to share unusual virus samples from around the world. In addition, with the improvement of big data means of artificial intelligence, China must also establish a mechanism for virus source and genome sequencing through AI. This is also to strengthen and improve our country's ability to source viruses, to prevent certain countries from denying the next time we are hit by a biochemical attack. On the military side, we should devote ourselves to preventing biological attacks against combatants, and strengthen special cooperation with the social public health system to strengthen the ability of the whole society to deal with large-scale epidemics. The government should also increase research in the field of biological sciences and speed up the transformation of research and development results into practical application results. Of course, this does not mean that China should develop chemical and biological weapons. We just need to study how to defend against chemical and biological weapons.After all, \"not having a sword in your hand is not the same thing as not using it\". Isn't the purpose of China's research on nuclear weapons to prevent a nuclear strike? On the military side, a relevant counter-strategy should be developed and published. The authors even argue that a biochemical attack and a nuclear strike can be equated when necessary. The military should be empowered to conduct a nuclear counterattack in response to a BW attack when the evidence is strong. Biochemical weapons are more dangerous to mankind than nuclear weapons, if mankind does not pay attention to the U.S. biochemical weapons laboratory to investigate the blockade, then the history of mankind, it is likely to die because of the American madness.",

        "text": "I work in an IT team for a large gov department. One of my responsibilities is to invoice the various teams/departments that have workloads in our cloud environment. That information is used by our finance team to recover the charges from the respective teams/departments. \n\nFor a long time, the recovery charges was manually collated into a spreadsheet by admin staff and sent to Finance to process. The relationship between the admin and finance was not the best - lots of snotty emails flying back and forth about mistakes, missing cost centres, sign offs/approvals, incorrect recoveries, and otherwise minor things. It was made worse by finance changing their requirements every couple of months, refusing to do recoveries, and causing a lot of consternation and aggravation in general.\n\nOne day Finance decided they needed evidence that we were informing customers of their charges. At this point I was over it, which is when my MC came into play: they didn't specifically state how this 'evidence' should look or how it should be delivered to them. I could have given them access to SharePoint where the invoices were stored. I could have zipped the invoices and included with the spreadsheet. Hell, I could have included a txt log showing each invoice being sent. But these don't actually prove the customers received it so I did the only feasible thing: include finance on every invoice sent. There are a lot of invoices. \n\nI made the change and waited to the next invoice run. A few hundred emails get sent the following month, all CC'd to Finance. As expected, Finance suffered from verbal diarrhea, hit the roof and demanded to know why we were including them (and CC'd everyone including my director). I responded with a simple 'Please refer to the attached email from you requesting evidence we are informing customers of their charges'. Radio silence. It wasn't until the second month of getting these invoices I was quietly asked to stop including Finance - it seemed they didn't need evidence after all. \n\nThese days the relationship with finance has improved a lot - I automated the last remaining parts of the invoicing / recovery reporting and by and large there hasn't been any significant issues since (a far cry from the near constant issues each month for years). I even got a merry Christmas / happy new year from them which is a pretty nice win for me.",

        "text": "Just happened today. \n\nSo a little backstory. I work for a warehouse that specializes in computer equipment. It's generally very uneventful, everyone is mostly nice to each other, save for one..... unsavory Engineer. He had a reputation for being very belligerent, and almost impossible to work with, but with a couple months left till his retirement, people tended to leave him alone. I know all too well he would be gone by Summer, so I decided not to engage with him till he was gone. \n\nCue this morning when I went to the warehouse to do some small inventory.\n\nAnd up comes the Engineer huffing and puffing. \n\nWithout evidence, he started accusing me of messing around with some pallets he was working on. Calmly, I explained to him that I did not, and he can check the camera HE INSTALLLED IN THE WAREHOUSE to see that I did no such thing. \n\nHe kept on insisting that I did, growing increasingly angrier and started cussing me out in a warehouse full of people. But I did not waver, and calmly insisted he can just check the security footage that he has access to, but the F-bombs just coming out. \n\nAt this point, I calmly told to him to breathe, cause he was getting out of control. \n\nAnd this is where it went from bad, to worse. \n\nHe started screaming and cussing even louder, that he is \"50 years older than me\", and I can \"not f\\*\\*king tell him to do shit.\" I said nothing, and watched as the Engineer get redder and redder in the face. \n\nEventually, he yelled \"If you have a f\\*\\*king problem with how I act, bring it up to HR or the Boss\" and stomped away. \n\nSo... I did just that. \n\nI made a quick note of who was in the warehouse, noted the time, asked 3 people to be my witnesses of what happened.\n\nSo up to HR I went, and poured out every exhaustive detail I can remember. I explained that I've been in enough companies to know that kind of treatment and verbal abuse borderlines harassment, if not pure threatening behavior. I explained, very calmly, I am not comfortable working in that environment, and I do not wish to escalate the situation anymore. I just wanted the incident documented and on record in case the Engineer tried to twist the story to management. \n\nHR said they would take care of it. \n\nTwo hours later, I found out the Engineer was told to go home. And not even twenty minutes later after that, he had been made \"permanently working from home.\" And not even twenty minutes after that, I found out all the Engineer's credentials had been revoked, his remote access to the company network disabled, and his day to day duties was divided to other people. His final project is now to write up his tasks and how to do them. \n\nWith 7 Months left to his retirement, it's not looking very good that he'll be around till then. \n\nTL:DR: Engineer yelled if I have a problem with him, bring it up to HR. He is now \"working from home permanently\"",

Also, while my family wasn’t poor at the time, I had an idea of money and frugality drilled into my head by my grandmother who grew up during the depression. This meant that I often didn’t ask for things and when asked would just evade the question to avoid being a “burden.” \n\nFast forward to around 14 years old, Grandpa asks me, as usual, what do I want for Christmas. Being typical me, and combining it with an apathetic teenage attitude just shrugged. He kept asking for several weeks. I kept shrugging and saying “I dunno?”\n\nChristmas Day rolls around. My grandfather always got me great gifts (my first mountain bike, Super Nintendo, basically all the hits from my childhood), but he never wanted to go first in handing out a present, until that year. He gets up and grabs a small, thin gift from under the tree and makes a big speech about how he wanted to get me the perfect gift, how he thought and thought, and how he figured out how to get me *exactly* what I wanted for Christmas. This fucker had one of his old lady customers crochet me a 3 inch by 5 inch question mark. I’m confused upon opening it and ask him what it is. This man looks me dead in the eye, shrugs, and goes “I dunno?”\n\n\nMiss you grandpa.",

        "text": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nアメリカ政府が最も望まないことが起こったのです先日、国連は生物兵器の査察体制を正式に創設することを決議しました。誰を狙っているのか言う必要はありません今回反対票を投じた国は世界でたった一国、それはアメリカだけでした。アメリカの熱烈な同盟国でさえも賛成票を投じました。\n\n新冠肺炎の発生から3年が経過しました。過去3年間、世界経済は大きな打撃を受けました。現在、新型コロナウイルスの起源に関する調査が進むにつれて、自然発生的なウイルスではなく、大確率で生物兵器であることを示す証拠が増えてきています。国連が生物化学兵器の査察条約を採択したのはそのためですこのような状況下で、世界で唯一反対票を投じたアメリカは、夜の蛍のように目立つと言えます。アメリカは、新型コロナウイルスの発生を隠すために、わざと反対票を投じたのかといえば、そうではなく、新型コロナ以外にも、特に生物兵器の開発において、あまりにも多くの邪悪なことをしてきたからだと思います。日本人はアメリカ人ほど悪くありません。終戦後、自国の生物化学兵器の防衛能力を探知するために、生物化学兵器の脅威を自主的にテストすることにしたのが有名な例です。それと同時にです\n\n最も現実的な効果を達成するために、アメリカの実験は実際のアメリカの都市で、何千人もの一般的なアメリカ人で行いました!ウィルスを持ち込んだクルーズ船をサンフランシスコに送りたった1日で街の全ての人に感染させましたこの地域を選んだ理由は、人口が密集し経済が発達しており、海から都市に吹く風が短時間で細菌を伝播し、重生物兵器の攻撃を最大限に再現できるからです。\n\nこの一週間、米軍は絶えずウィルスを散布しました。散布時間の長さ、温度、風向、風速、湿度、そしてこのバクテリアに感染した土壌、水質、さらには人々まで、この実験と関係があると記録されています。サンフランシスコに住む多くの人が髄膜炎にかかっています\n\n婉曲に言いますと、日本は自分たちの人間を使って生物兵器の実験をしたくても、自分たちの大都市をそのままシャーレにはしません。\n\n知るところによると、米国の生物実験室は多くのいわゆる米国の同盟国の領土にも存在し、ロシアとウクライナの沖突の中にあるウクライナだけでもすでに26の米国の認可した生物実験室があります。他のいわゆる同盟国には、まだ承認されていない生物実験室がもっとあるかもしれません。アメリカはこの危険行為を公式には認めていません。アメリカの行為は、日本の核排水のように危険なグローバルな安全保障リスクになっており、それは人類の未来を破壊しています。ロシアがウクライナで押収した文書によると、米国がウクライナに建設したこれらの生物実験室で展開する科学研究プロジェクトの多くが、危険な疾病と関連していることが分かりました。今でも、アメリカのいわゆる生物学者は、ニューコロナウイルスの新しい株を開発しています。アメリカは生物兵器禁止条約を再三拒否し、われわれが生物化学兵器を開発しているというシグナルを発信しています。ただ、今回国連で生物兵器禁止条約が採択されましたが、彼らが不利な条約を守ったことがないことは、アメリカ人は知っています。\n\n米国政府に直面して、無道徳の操守、無下限線、無エンドラインの生物戦、中国人民はどのように自分を保護しますか?事実上、早くも抗米援朝の時期に、米国対東北の生物戦争に直面して、中国はすでに合格の答案を提出しました。この答案用紙は、時代の流れに合わせて、少しでも修正することができます。\n\nまず、生物兵器の早期警戒能力を形成し、病原体に対する監督管理と検出能力を高めなければなりません。\n\ncdcと協力して世界中から異常なウイルスのサンプルを共有する最初の組織になりました\n\nまた、人工知能によるビッグデータの手段が整ってくると、中国でもAIによるウイルスの発生源やゲノムの配列決定の仕組みづくりが必要になってきます。\n\nこれも我が国のウイルス発生能力を強化し高めるためで、いくつかの国は私達が次に生物化学攻撃を受けた時否定することを防止します。軍事面では、戦闘員に対する生物学的攻撃の予防に力を入れ、社会の公共衛生システムと特別な協力を強化し、社会全体で大規模な疫病に対応する能力を強化しなければなりません。バイオ科学分野の研究にも力を入れ、研究開発の成果を実用化の成果に転化させなければなりません。もちろん、中国が生物化学兵器を開発すべきだという意味ではありません。化学生物兵器をどう防衛するかを研究すればいいのです「剣を持っていないことと、剣を使わないことは別問題」ですから。中国が核兵器を研究する目的は、核攻撃を防ぐためではないでしょうか。\n\n軍事面では、逆戦略を立てて公表しなければなりません。著者は、生物化学攻撃と核攻撃は、必要な場合、同一視できるとさえ考えています。証拠がある場合には、軍は生物化学兵器攻撃に対する核反撃の権限を与えられるべきです。\n\n生物化学兵器は人類にとって核兵器よりも危険です。もし人類が米国の生物化学兵器実験室の閉鎖調査を重視しなければ、人類の歴史は米国人の狂気によって滅びかねません。",

        "text": "I was hired by an affordable housing finance and construction company about 3 years ago to be their sustainability coordinator. That job title is only in name because they have literally not given me anything to do with the environment or sustainability, but instead are treating me as the assistant to everyone. Which you know what really sucked, but hey I am a team player. So a little more than 2 years go by and I'm still doing the assistant stuff and swamped with work because of it. One of my bosses decides that I’m not busy enough and decides to give me the role of safety supervisor for our entire construction portion of the company; you know the 6 developments that we have under construction and the 200+ employees. So being the team player I am I decide to help out with that. I come to find out that we are over a year out of compliance with 3 of the 6 developments. So after like 6 weeks of trying to catch us up I finally have all of the documents and applications filled out and I just need my boss to fill out a very very small section and sign the documents and I’m pumped about that. I caught us up 2 weeks before all of the major holidays and right before I go on vacation… nope apparently not. My boss decides to not fill out any of the applications before I go on vacation and before he goes on vacation. And that fucking broke me. I was constantly told that this is extremely important and that we needed to get these in as soon as possible and instead of getting angry I decided in that moment to make sure that we will be compliant with everything. \n\nSo cue malicious compliance… \n\nAs the safety supervisor, I am in charge of all of the training that the entire company goes through, which mainly applies to the people in the field. BUT the one thing that all employees have to do is Harassment training. This harassment training takes about 2.5 hours to do if you are not a supervisor; if you are a supervisor you have to take a 4-hour course. So I go to set this up and find out that my boss is not set up for the supervisor harassment training and we can’t have that. So I set my boss up with a 4-hour harassment training course (which if I’m being honest he needs) (sexist, racist, transphobic, and homophobic). \n\nTLDR: Boss decides that I’m not busy enough and gives me a new job as safety supervisor. Doesn’t fill out my necessary paperwork so I decide to make him take an extra long Harassment training course.",

        "text": "Backstory: Hubs and I were hunting for a new credit card with travel benefits. So together we opened a joint account, each with separate cards, the difference between us is that I opened the account, have the app, responsible for making monthly payments. A few days ago I entered my PIN incorrectly online trying to make a purchase, despite being confident in my PIN it was clear that old age and new change has taken its toll.\n\nSo. Today I settle in for a telephone call. Sidenote: I prefer online chat and email support as opposed to hanging on a phone line for half an hour (UK) but despite my cloud notes I had clearly written down the wrong PIN and I was so angry at myself for forgetting to document this new information accurately.\n\nTelephone call was way better than expected, I breezed through security whilst simultaniously furiously navigating the bank website which was unfamiliar. The lady was magnificent in identifying my frustrations and I recognised hwe tone of voice and delivery made me feel like I wasn't the aged blithering idi0t that I felt I was.\n\nWhizzed through the resests (embarrassing) I even tried to joke that I knew my postcode with the phonetic alphabet as I'd repeated it all morning. All I had to do was put my card in \\[BANK\\] ATM. Sweet, gotta walk across into town anyway. \n\n\\[BANK\\] said I specifically need an ATM and not just any small business that accepted the  \\[BANK\\] card. One was 4 miles away, one was 0.6 miles away and 0.1 miles away from the supermarket I was walking to. Sweet. \n\nHappily hopping I entered the Super Drug General Pharmacy store which was pracrically empty, there was a greeter with a headset. Yay for personal service! Below, I am ME and HS is Headset ME: HEADSET:\n\nME: {Happy explains I don't need to find an item I just need to put my card in their card reader. Gestured to no queue and cashier waiting}\n\nHEADSET: Let me speak to my manager (*explains there is a crazy lady here who doesn't want to buy anything nor get cashback*) Sorry, my manager said she's never heard of that\n\nME: Well, neither have I until half an hour ago, My choices were \\[Village\\] four miles away, or you half a mile away. \\[BANK\\] sent me a website link to a Google map. Can you ask again please?\n\nHEADSET: *Says some words* \"Sorry, no\"\n\nAt this point I tried a third time, not expecting to be here in this situation. I have a red eye flight to Europe in a few hours time, I needed to verify my PIN so I can spend NYE on a beach for the first time in my life.\n\nHEADSET: \"Manager says you'll need to buy something and use your card that way\"\n\nME: Fine, Walk up the aisle, swipe some toothpaste, walk to the till and pay using my (verifiyayed) card.   \n\n\nASSISTANT: Would you like a receipt?\n\nME: Yes please thank you very much\n\nASSISTANT: Here you go, have a good day\n\nME: {*Sliding the toothpaste and receipt back to his side of the counter, in a terribly high pitched and happy voice*} THANK YOU *slides* Hi, please can I request a refund?\n\nASSISTANT: moment of silence, looks at me. \"Really\" \n\nME: YUP (Ear splitting grin showing all my teeth) \n\nASSISTANT: Proceeds to call for a manager to authorise the refund, HEADSET walked over, I am still Cheshire Catting and she rolls her eyes to Mars. Wordless, she processes my refund, I gloriously and flamboyantly wave my card over the reader to get a satisfying **beep** that my card certainly does work, and I can shop with confidence on holiday.\n\nTL;DR Manager demands I purchase something to verify my card. I do so and instantly ask for a refund. They have to comply as I'm not breaking any UK laws.",

When I told them I wanted to stay, they started staging incidents/messes around the house so they could yell at me for them and it all came to a head when they called a meeting with me two days ago. One of them had to hold the other back as she screamed at me that she hated me and I was not welcome in the building. They proceeded to tell me that I contributed nothing to the house and wasted their space and that they had gotten in with the landlady and convinced her to not renew my lease in June. \n\nI told them I’d talk to the landlady and when they said they were the heads of the house I laughed and went on with my day. I spoke to the landlady and she acknowledged that they were out of hand and while she had given them the power to not renew my lease, she also said I could move out whenever and not pay for a single day I wasn’t there. So, yesterday when my roommates both left to visit family (they are sisters), I immediately called everyone I knew and vacated the house of everything I owned. I took the curtains, the rugs, all the cat toys and even the cat tower that I had made with my mom. I took all of their things off my shelves and other furniture and stacked them in the middle of the now nearly empty living room. I snapped pictures of everything, handed the keys to the landlady and immediately fucked off.\n\nThey won’t be back to the house until tomorrow. I’ve blocked them on everything so I won’t get any angry messages, but I’m sure their faces will be priceless when they come home to a half-empty house with hundreds of dollars in storage and furniture gone. So much for me not contributing anything to the house, now I actually don’t. They also have to find someone else to take up the lease till boyfriend can move in when June comes around or they have to pick up my rent.\n\nFeels pretty good.",

Like really wanted. At the end of Christmas, I realized that Jon got me literately nothing, and had intended for our mother to get me socks. So I just kind of internalized it. Cut to mid 2020 and he was back in town. His birthday rolls around and he asked for 100 Dragon Shield card sleeves. Dragon Shield, huh? I can work with this.  \n\n\nI went to my local board game store, where Jon is pretty well known, and I talked to one of the employees about getting the UGLIEST color of Dragon Shield sleeves, Fusion. They're this weird color between brown and pink. They're so ugly they actually stopped making them due to lack of demand. They had one box of 100 count, so I bought them. I wrapped them nicely and gave them to him (with receipt).   \n\n\nJon was not happy with his present, because it meant one of two things. It either meant that he had to socially interact with the employees to return them, which despite liking them he doesn't like social interactions if he can avoid them, or he'd have to use them and stare at the card sleeves so ugly the company that made them stopped making them. \n\nThis is all the fallout was, I'm sorry about the lackluster response.",

The car in front of me suddenly slammed the brakes so I in turn slam my brakes and the cars behind me do the same. This absolute egg of a driver who was the 3rd car behind me however failed to brake in time leading to that car (car 1) rear ending the car 2 in front of him so badly that car 2 rear ended car 3 and car 3 rear ended me (car 4). \n\nAs we were all sitting in the middle lane during peak hour traffic, we were unable to really pull over so ended up flashing our hazards and come out to make sure everyone was safe and then exchanged details. Myself and the drivers of cars 2 and 3 are all calm minus them being a bit frustrated due to having young children in the back. Come the egg who drove car 1, who makes a big deal of having to call the police first and then refusing to share details without police present and finally follows with blaming me saying that it was my fault that the 4 car pileup happened as I was the car in front despite the fact that the car behind me was an SUV which managed to brake in time yet his ratty looking corolla didn't. Police eventually arrive and inform the egg that he had to exchange details which he finally complied with but not before telling me that I should just admit that it was my fault and that I should tell the insurance company everything and they will see that I was to blame too. \n\nMalicious Compliance: The insurance company of car 1 calls me a few weeks later to confirm stories to identify who was at fault as the driver's story was pointing to car 3 who was behind me as the one who somehow caused the accident which led to the 4 car pile up. Due to the egg telling me that I should tell the insurance company everything, I told them I would gladly tell them the full story, stressing very clearly that car 3 was most likely not at fault due to the fact that after I hit the brakes to a stop, there was a decent few seconds following before I felt an impact.\n\nFallout: Not confirmed but I would like to think that car 1 got hit with the full insurance bill. My car was an SUV with a solid tow bar at the back so only the tow bar got hit which did more damage to the car that rear ended me which meantI didn't have any insurance claims on my end and thus have no idea about the final outcome. \n\nDisclaimer: Sorry if this story does not fit this sub but I thought of it while scrolling through stories.",

My senior year it was Social Justice. Our teacher (we’ll call her P) was the absolute worst. She was brand new, extremely homophobic, and basically hated anyone who wasn’t EXTREMELY Catholic. Every morning, we had morning prayer, pledge of allegiance, and announcements before the official start of class. P would purposely close the classroom doors and lock them so anyone who came in after prayer started would have to stand in the hallway until morning announcements are over. On this particular morning, my friend B (who was the smartest person in our grade… our valedictorian) was speaking to a teacher before first period Social Justice. He made it right at the bell, but P had already locked the doors. Prayer began and one of our classmates snuck over to the door and let B in. We thought all was well until announcements ended and P starts SCREAMING at us to tell her who was late. None of us say a peep because… snitches get stitches and end up in ditches. P gets angrier and says “IF YOU DON’T TELL ME  WHO WALKED IN DURING PRAYER YOU WILL ALL GO GET LATE SLIPS FROM THE PRINCIPAL!” Our entire class (about 20 kids) looked at each other and decided to comply. We all walked downstairs and into the lobby of our school where the principal and VP offices were. Our VP took one look at us and said “What the hell are you all doing here?” We told him P sent us all there to get late slips because we let B in during prayer… P considers that “late”, and none of us wanted to snitch. Plus, B was on time to school and would have been in the classroom had P not locked the doors before the bell. He paused and looked at us all for a bit, chuckled, and said “Get back to class”. Needless to say that was P’s first AND last year teaching there.",

        "text": "I work on the line at The Bread Restaurant. This morning, a cocky new manager opened the store. He came from another store, so he thinks he knows everything and is trying to \"manage\" the wrong things. For example, when I'm on the line, I make sure everyone gets a break if they want one. (This includes me. I'm not a manager, so I'm not trying to get screwed out of my break by ensuring my coworkers get one, too. However, being on the line all morning, I know when the best times for people to go on break are and who can step in to cover those people.)\nToday, though, this manager decided it was his big chance to \"enforce the rules\" and make sure everyone went on break. So, he assigned us all times to take our breaks. I don't like this guy. He's lazy and never helps out on the line when we need it. So today was my opportunity to sit back and watch it all fall apart.\nOur catering person had to open the front of the store and be cashier all day, so the line had to do her catering order. No big deal, I used to do catering and would be happy to do it if asked. Will I volunteer to do it? Hell no. Not my responsibility when Mr. Manager wants to delegate everything. Instead, he didn't even print the order or tell us to do it until like 9:30. He also didn't ask anyone to do it; he printed it, hung it up on the line, and walked back to the office to continue doing nothing. No problem, I'll start making sandwiches for it. Too bad my break is at 10.\n\nWhen I left for break, most of the catering order still had to be made. Soups weren't on the line yet, and people had started ordering them. Mr. Manager is still in the office. When I leave for break, no one will be available to make the order because they're making the orders on the screen. Not my problem. I let Mr. Manager know the situation, to be nice, and went on break.\nWhen I got back, it was a disaster. The order was exactly how I left it, Mr. Manager was still in the office, and only like 2 of the soups had been brought up. It was an absolute shit show and I had a front row seat. It was so validating to watch it all crash and burn. Maybe this dude will learn to stop trying to fix things that aren't broken, and instead focus on actually helping out.",

        "text": "So I volunteered with a non-profit service club for almost 2 decades. We had a fundraiser (legally licensed gambling in our country) that would gross $1.5mil per year. There were only a dozen members, so we didn't do much except hang out, volunteer for other charities, and re-donate the money with a big presentation cheque.\n\nIn 2019, we fired one of the two employees for our fundraiser. I agreed to work for 3 months as a contractor at $25/hr until they found a replacement. I found ways to improve the fundraiser and turned $1.5mil in annual sales into $8mil after only 9 months. Then COVID hit, and I revamped everything again to get us $15mil annual sales ($10mil net profit) in 6 months.\n\nI was working my ass off putting in 50-60 hour weeks sometimes. The club was pressuring me to submit an invoice, as I hadn't been paid the entire time. I wasn't motivated to charge anything since my original intent was to work for free for 3 months, but finally submitted a discounted invoice for $52K for the past 15 months after we all agreed I'd been working too long and they dropped the ball in their intention to hire a replacement. They paid, but freaked out on me and accused me of greed, fraud, incompetence, etc. A combination of their behavior and them being greedy (pushing for massive donations that would get them ahead in their professions, spending money on fancy gala dinners and golf tournaments with the rich elite of the community, etc) and I was frustrated and pissed beyond belief. \n\nI stuck around (and sometimes got guilted by members into staying after multiple attempts to quit) for another year out of loyalty to my staff (almost 2 dozen at that point) and the charities I was involved with for decades. But I finally broke and walked away at the end of 2021. \n\nHere's where the malicious compliance comes in. Before leaving, I was implementing a two part plan for another revamp of the fundraiser to keep up with the huge sales and prizes. Each part had benefits and consequences individually, so they had to be implemented together to balance each other out. The first part took a long time to plan before I left, and once it was ready it was easy to put the second part in action right away. I reported what I was doing to the club, and they accused me of being incompetent once again for not understanding the consequences of the second part of the plan. They didn't understand the big picture, but I was tired of arguing with them. I implemented the first part as they had approved because everything was already changed over and impossible to revert back. I didn't try to convince them at all about the second part being necessary, and left them to deal with the consequences after quitting.\n\nA year later they are accusing me of sabotaging them, and not explaining the need for the second part. The fundraiser has fallen apart this past year with less than $2mil in sales but still with massive expenses, as well as a half assed revamped system bleeding money. They've reportedly lost money this year, and have no idea what went wrong. I deleted all my documents and plans when I returned the work laptop to them, also as malicious compliance because they asked for it in original condition and ready for someone new to use.",

        "text": "I can’t go too specific into the details, but I work in a customer service department for a company that has clients who sign contracts with us.\n\nPart of these contracts states that if someone makes a full payment for the first term instead of monthly payments, they get a discounted rate. BUT, the full payment has to be scheduled at the time the contract is written and signed.\n\nWe had a new client today who signed up in the morning with monthly payments. The contract stated that our services were to begin tomorrow, and they made the first monthly payment today. \n\nSeveral hours later, they called to say that they could pay the first term in full so that they could get the discount. As a supervisor, I approved the change and added the discount. I took the full payment minus the discount, and it looked like a great business relationship.\n\n30 minutes later, someone from another department put me on blast in an email to the whole company, saying that because a monthly payment was taken today, I did not have the ability to switch to pay in full and add the discount.\n\nThey’re technically correct. The pay in full discount is only supposed to be added if they pay the full term, and any payments less than that should disqualify them. They told me to call the customer back and explain why they weren’t getting the discount.\n\nSo I called the customer, and gave them the following information:\n\n- you do not qualify for the pay in full discount because you set up a monthly payment plan at the signing of the contract\n\n- our services do not start until tomorrow. This means that if you cancel now, there are no penalties or additional fees.\n\n- if you cancel now, we will cancel the payment scheduled for today, and you will owe nothing \n\n- if you cancel now, you can then speak to a sales rep who will set you up with exactly the same contract, but you can set it up as pay in full for the additional discount\n\n- **If you cancel and then call my extension, I’m allowed to offer you addition discounts to retain your business**\n\nLong story short: they canceled their contract, called me, and then I had sales give them a new contract with a pay in full discount and a retention discount. On top of that, we paid a full day’s worth of wages between the additional handling required for the changes.",

We generally got along but he was a bit stingy and would get really anal about certain things that affected me unfairly as a paying roommate. The biggest point of contention was the thermostat. I like to be comfortable and would keep it at 70, he preferred 65 to save money even though he was well off. I tried to compromise, but it descended into us each moving the thermostat when the other left. Finally he put his foot down and said it has to stay at 65.  \nUnfortunately for my roommate, I had learned about bimetalic strips that old thermostats used to gauge temperature. Two different metals are back to back in a coil. As one expands more than the other, the coil unwinds and turns the furnace on or off.  \nKnowing this, I agreed to keep it at \"65\". But I didn't agree not to put a teensy, tiny kink in the strip behind the dial to change what \"65\" meant to the furnace. Several times he thought it's not stupidly cold in here, and started obsessively checking the dial to catch me red handed. He was so confused when it was exactly at 65 every time.  \nEventually he started setting it even cooler to compensate. But with a subtle kink here or there I managed to stay comfortable while keeping the peace.",

        "text": "This was a while ago and I have since quit this job. \n\nI used to work at a diner on the weekends. To-go coffees are served in styrofoam cups and only come in one size (12oz). \n\nA trucker came in for breakfast and he asked for a \"big coffee\" to go. Again, they only come in one size. So I sold him a 12-oz coffee and gave him his cup. Usually we leave space in case people want to add cream, but I filled his up all the way. Then my manager pulls me aside in front of him and reprimands me for not giving him a \"big coffee\" like he asked for. All while he's nodding and smiling. \n\nWhen I asked her what she would like me to do because we only have coffee cups in one size, she tells me I should have known that I was supposed to use a soft drink cup instead. Those cups are 30oz. In my entire time working there, we have never done that. There is no option in the register to charge someone for a 30oz coffee. But the customer was upset, so she made up a nonexistent rule on the spot and belittled me to make him happy. She threw me under the bus. \n\nYou'd be surprised how many customers ask for \"big,\" \"large,\" \"jumbo,\" \"huge,\" \"enough to fill a 10-gallon\" coffees everyday. It's usually a joke followed by some comment about them being tired. They aren't really asking about coffee cup size. They're just trying to make conversation and use silly words. \n\nSo for the next several months I proceeded to give every single person who made a comment about coffee size a 30oz coffee and charge them for a 12oz. That coffee maker was constantly going. I mean constantly. We were going through bags of coffee like crazy... Almost as if we were selling nearly three times as much without making more profit from it.",

There's a communication channel we usually use to inform others that we're taking off. It's exclusive to all developers.\nLast time I took off during the end of a sprint. We're doing agile development. It certainly is not the best time to take off, but I didn't do anything out of the norm. Other colleagues do the same. They take off, too, regardless of the sprint ending. I gave a heads up the day prior to my leave and colleagues commented that it's sad not to have me around.\n\nThe day after I took my leave my scrum master wants to talk to me. He was asking what happened and told me nobody knew where I was the previous day. They had expected me to come. I told him I gave a heads up like I do EVERY MONTH for the past year.\n\nHe was okay with it, no problem. The next message I received was from my personal manager. He's communicating aggressively with me.\nHe says that nobody knew where I was (actually no, my colleagues knew and commented the second I wrote about my leave and I have no clue why they didn't communicate it to the rest of the team), that the higher ups in my project are very unhappy about it etc.\nI told him I communicated with the team, they knew I was taking my leave. I told him I didn't change any routine, I used the regular communication channel and reminded him I take off for a day every month for a company internal event and he knows there haven't been any problems in the past months, so I don't understand why it wasn't communicated to rest of the team that I wouldn't be there that day.\n\nWe had changed routine just recently and the misunderstanding came from other team members checking an absence calendar I had just received access to days prior (others had access to it for months at this point and had used it already) and I was totally not used to using this tool.\nThey expected everyone to use this tool immediately when it wasn't communicated to us that way.\n\nHere comes my malicious compliance. I told my personal manager I would do better in the future and use all available channels to keep everyone in the loop what's going on. I already started today with my plan of spamming every single communication channel (mail, WhatsApp, absence calendar, including RocketChat) and wrote to all higher ups additionally about my absence.\nI have 30 days of vacation and I have company internal events on top of it. \n\nI am waiting for them to say something about how I can't spam every single communication channel with a message regarding my leave, even if it's just one day.\n\nThey reap what they sow. Nobody will have a chance to accuse me again regarding not informing the team about my absence.",

And it was amazing ! \nSince I’m an adult I also gifted my grandparents parents and uncle and aunt all the same food degustation. \nThis meant that in comparaison to my cousins us three only had 1 gift from our parents and my bro and sis had one gift from me to open and that’s it. Our cousins (15M) (13M) (11M) and (5F) all opened at least 5 gifts each. \n\nWe’re a family kinda big about meal tradition. So when after that my grandpa served wine to everyone and passed the bottle to my uncle (his son) so he could serve himself and his wife I almost chocked. As a battle had started my aunt started eating before my grandma was even seated. \n\nAnd then after dessert we all usually hug each other thanking for the presents. My sister brother and parents did not hug my uncle and aunt as they had gifted nothing to them but them kinda had to. They thanked my parents and I and when it came to both my uncle and aunt I just said with a big smile “Kinda wished I could thank you as well.”\n\nThis year Christmas ended with smiles. No big open fight started but manners fights during lunch and dinner were really funny to watch.",

In particular, I spent a lot of my money on my nine year old daughter and she deserves in 100%. She has been pushing herself in school, helping around in the house without being asked, and always being the kindest soul you'll ever meet.\n\nHowever, when my mother in law came early in the morning and saw how the gifts under our tree were much more than usual she asked why. I told her I bought everyone a bunch of gifts, including her. She then preceded to ask how much gifts I got my daughter and I told her about 3 big gifts and 3 mini ones. Apparently, this outraged her because she started saying that a nine year old did not deserve that many gifts and she would be taking away the gift she bought my daughter so that my daughter wouldn't be too spoiled. I told her that was unfair especially since my mother in law promised my daughter a doll for Christmas and my daughter was looking forward for it. My mother in law said let it be a lesson to my daughter that in life she cant get all things she asks for.\n\nLook I understand that, but its not like I shower my daughter in gifts everyday. And if anything Christmas is the day you are supposed to spoil your children. But my wife told me to let it go and it was her mothers gift and therefore she could do anything she wanted with it and her mother agreed saying it was her right.\n\nAnd if we were going to play with that ideology then so be it. I decided to remove the 600$ designer bag I got my MIL, the thing I knew she wanted the most, and gave her a 40$ robe instead.\n\nOnce my MIL opened her present she was disappointed asking if that was all from me, because everyone else got increasingly more expensive gifts from me. And I said yes and apologized if I disappointed her but we cant always get the gifts we hoped for.\n\nThis left both her and my wife extremely furious, but hey the MIL got enough gifts I wouldn't want to spoil her!\n\nI posted this to AITA and got advice to return the bag and spend it towards a day out with my daughter and buying her a doll. Guess who is planning on doing that and post it onto my instagram maybe with a cheeky caption ;) anyone got ideas?",

The board wanted it to be all affordable housing and would not agree to the rezoning. So he kept it commercial and built a cheap truck parking area. It’s actually amazing.

This is an MNC that handles international and tech clients, and this is how you maintain your employees? Well fine, if that’s the game you want to play, then let’s play.\n\nOn paper, I’ve been fulfilling that lovely requirement. A task that would normally take an hour to do gets done in 15 mins? I’ll put it down as a full hour. Meetings can be logged too, so I multitask and complete some work during these meetings, so that 1 hour meeting will also have an additional hour clocked in as well. Oh reading and replying emails can be logged too, and took me over 2 hours to do over the course of the day? I’ll just input that as 3 hours. So on paper, I’ve worked 10-12 hours when in actuality, it’s only been 6-8 hours. And only hours are logged, not the time.\n\nAfter all, my manager gave me a weird look when I tried to be accurate with rounding down to the 15 minute mark, and they mention that everyone has been clocking in to the full hour instead (though this is only because no one ever told me how they’ve logged their hours before). I’m only listening and following what my managers and colleagues are doing, and I wouldn’t want to deviate from everyone else after all. Aren’t I such a team player?\n\nLook, if the company wants to pay according to quantity instead of quality, then I’ll adjust my hours to reflect that. The company gets to charge clients more and I get more pay. Isn’t that a lovely win win for all? 😇\n\nNote: I do not consent to this post being reproduced in other form of media",

Also, English isn't my 1st language, so please forgive any mistakes. \n\nSome background (you can also read the AITA post on my profile): \n\n \n\nThe last school year has been challenging for me at work. I'm an English high school teacher (not in the US), and the work environment at that school has been going from bad to worse as the school year progressed. Our principal has created a very hostile and toxic work and learning environment that has made many young teachers leave, even at the start and middle of the year (very uncommon in my country).\n\nI (32M), and many of the other teachers, have felt bullied and oppressed. Our complaints went unheard and ridiculed, with the principal targeting many of us (young and experienced teachers alike) for public shaming sessions. And my turn came last week. I asked for a meeting with her to discuss my desire to go back to university next year to complete my thesis, which would have resulted in me taking Tuesdays off (all teachers in my country get a day off, which is usually for us to choose). As soon as I walked in, she called the pedagogical administrator, and they both started a 30 min shaming session. I was told that I am a lousy teacher, my classes are boring (they never attended any of my classes), that I have conspired to ruin English teaching at our school, and that students, parents, other teachers, and administrators have been complaining about me. She wants teachers to work full-time (which she knows I planned on doing anyway and have been asking for it for two years) and advised me to take a break from teaching (unpaid leave).\n\nI was shocked and speechless. In my three years at that school, I received only praise from everyone I worked with. My students, their parents, and colleagues love me (to which I have written proof). The following day, I went ahead and turned in my notice. She called me a liar (I told other teachers what happened as they saw me coming out pale and on the verge of tears out of her office) and said that I couldn't take criticism. She has also started lying about me to colleagues and other school principals (they all know me and told me). She also told me to complain to whomever I want.\n\nQue malicious compliance: following my excellent advice on AITA, I waited to file the complaint until I secured a new position. However, I decided to follow that last bit of advice from her. I sent it to whomever I thought might be interested- the regional English teaching inspectorate, the regional general inspectorate, the teachers' union, every official and inspector in my country's ministry of education, and the best part- every teaching college and program in a 200-kilometer radius which included the most prominent and largest education programs in my country and area. \n\nFallout: The principal had to beg the ministry to send them new teachers, as quite a few of us left at the end of last year. Most of the poor English teachers she did get contacted me via mutual friends and colleagues, asking me for help getting new positions as the work environment has only gotten worse, a request to which I gladly obliged. The complaint itself didn't impact the principal professionally, but she will have a pretty difficult time filling positions for the next few years.  A few colleagues from that school will join me next year as they kept calling me to vent about the worsening conditions there, so I just told them to send me their CVs, which my coordinator was more than happy to receive. \n\nAs for me- I found a wonderful school outside of my city where I could rediscover my love of teaching. Not only have I found a place where I feel good, but I also found a second job- I now teach at my local college, where the hourly rate is five times my school salary. I have also found the courage to start something I always wanted to do- move to another country, which I'm on track to do in 2024 (for more information about why look at my profile.",

The crew I was working with and myself finished. Then she bolts in the store screaming that I wasn’t doing anything besides sitting and she watched me on camera not doing my job as an employee and just cleaned. Cue the malicious compliance. I have only been doing my job as an employee for the store and a couple days ago. The inspector came in on my day off and we didn’t do very well. The day after, I was yelled at for not cleaning. Then I apologized and said “Oh sorry. I was just doing my job that I was told to do.” Let’s just say that neither my manager nor her boss was happy about my actions.",

Which is when i noticed Karen almost driving into the back of me (limit is 50 kph).\n\nShe sat in my arse the entire time so i figured some MC would work here.\n\nI proceeded to comply to the letter of the law and stopped dead at the next stop, did my motions and pulled away at an acceptable rate.\nAt the next stop i could hear \"OH COME ON!\" from her (that is how tranquil and quiet this area is, can hear someone farting in the next car.\nAt me last stop (literally 50 meters from my new place) she decided that wheel spinning from behind me, cutting the corner and getting infront of me would shave off enough milliseconds off of her trip that it would justify her young child sitting in front.

Basically there was quite a bit of work that went in to each part but there was about 12” of weld that the robot couldn’t do that we had to do by hand, and they had to pass ultrasonic testing. \n\nSo I was getting 10 parts done in a shift as well as 120” of weld. While they guy I was working with would get two parts done and 24” of weld. \n\nOne Friday the foreman comes over and asked the other guy if he wanted to work Saturday but not me. I asked if he could use my help too and he said, “No. I’d rather have guys working Saturday that can pass their UTs 100%”\n\nI pointed out that not only did I do 5x the work but I passed about 99% of the time. I would fail about 1” of weld per 120”. AND I’d have it repaired and passed before the end of the shift.  This still wasn’t good enough and basically told me it doesn’t matter since I’m still failing. \n\nSo come Monday I only started completely finishing 2 parts and day and got my passing rate up to 100%. Boss comes over frantically in the middle of the week trying to find out why my productivity has decreased so dramatically. And I said, “Sorry boss. I was trying to work on my pass rate.”\n\nHis face got so fucking red it was hard to keep a straight face. But I started getting Saturday work after that.",

        "text": "A bit of backstory.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I was at this job everyone was kind and nice and we were just a great team. We had a chill managment team, apart from 1. Lets call her Judith. Judith loved writing people up and making our lives hell, although she was just an assistant manager she would always jump at the opportunity to manage the team for a few days if the main manager is off. Lets call this manager Bob, Bob was an easygoing person, you wouldn't really see him that often but he was overall chill. Now we could always handle Judith as any complaints/writeups etc that she processed had to be approved by Bob or the Regional Manager (Lets call him Joe) Joe was the coolest guy ever, he was super fucking rich to. His wife is a realtor at a massive company. She was the COO (Cheif Opperating Officer) at it and she was super nice too! Back to Joe- He wasn't just a chill manager he was also a reallt great guy. He would bring us all out for beer (Department with 30+ people) on someones birthday and would approve (basically) any vacation requests if you were on the right side of him and overall he was just a lovley boss. Now my job was a pretty important tech-job. I was in a sub-department with 4-5 people, we made sure that the major systems (Product inventory system, POS system, website etc) were up and running and we controlled the servers that were connected to them all. What we didn't manage was the employee systems (Email, ticketing, employee portal etc) that was another sub-department.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, as I was saying we could handle Judith because basically none of her shit write ups and complaints got listened to by Bob or Joe. Now on this particular month Bob was celebrating his 35th aniversery and Joe was sick in hospital (worst timing- I know.) We all mentally prepared ourselves for Judiths wrath, this time we were informed by Bob that any write-up, department change or complaint didn't have to be approved by them as Joe was also gone. We thought no big deal and we will just get Bob to clear them when we come back.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOnto the story. Were gonna take it day-by day\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 1:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJudith was camping at the door, anyone who was in after 9:00am was written up. I was luckily in there at 9 on the dot, so was everyone else since we were used to Judith's shennanigans by now. I was talking to my buddy in the main software and tech department, he told me she was in there all day focusing on this one guy. Lets call him George, I knew George quite well, he was a family freind and for some reason Judith never liked him. She wrote him up 5 times for shitty reasons like: On cell phone during work time. Making work enviornment unsanitary and unsafe for other employees (he left an empty plastic bottle on his desk for about an hour etc. Did I mention he was Joe's son?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 2:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJudith was in our department today, focusing on my colleauge, lets call her Michelle. Michelle is the sweetest person in the world and would never do anything to hurt/ruin anything of anyones and she is just a genuine and sweet person. Judith found nothing and when Judith confronted Michelle she said she didn't know what she wanted and Judith filed a complaint for \"backchat\".  Judith then hosted a department-wide meeting (So main tech/software and the 7 sub-departments)  she told us that we need to stop being so rude to her just because shes a women blah blah blah. That night I send a message onto the managment-free group with everyone from the department saying not to engage with Judith, we can't get written up by her for rudeness/disrespect if we don't talk to her!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 3: (Cue malicious compliance)**\n\nOn day 3, we all come in. The day starts as usual, we all come in at the right time so Judith had no one to write up. We head to our departments and begin work as usual. Judith wasn't focused on someone from my department so lucky us. At about midday we hear Judith going ape shit at someone from the deparment that managed the employee systems because they werent talking to her. She kept going on and on at him but still no response. Finally Judith gave him one last chance before announcing the entire department is being suspended for sexism and disrespect. Our room was next to their one so we heard everything crystal clear, then to Judiths surprise everyone gathers their things and leaves without a word. I didn't get to see the look on her face but I bet she was livid. Then she moved onto my department, she came in and told us we have to do all the work for the other department as they are all suspended and to her dismay no one batted an eye at her. Out of the corner of my eye I could see her face going dark red- until she got up on a chair and started screaming at us all, then counting down from 10. All of us knew what was coming so we slowly began to log out of our things and pack up, without being too obvious. By the time she got to 1 we were all ready to leave. Can you guess what was coming? If you said your all suspended you would be correct! We then- left! I messaged one of my buddies in the other departments and she did the exact same thing to his department. Turns out she did it to 5/6 department, the one she left was the least useful department (Customer Services) Yes it is an important one but not nearly as important as financial, development etc. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Day 4:**  \n\n\nNone of us went in (Bar customer services) until we got a message from Bob asking why none of us are in work, it was the day he came back. We told him we were all suspended. He asked why and we told him the genuine reason. He was absolutley furious at Judith and proceeded to call us all in for a \"staff meeting\" (It was really front row tickets to Judiths Downfall)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe proceeded to criticise her for all her false write ups, accusations and how she has done barley any of the roles that the assistant manager should be doing. He then.... FIRED HER!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBob made us turn all the systems onto auto mode and gave us Friday off.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat an awesome man..  \n\n\n(NB: Joe got out of hospital but sadly passed a few months later from cancer of the liver, I have since left the company and have no real info of what happened after the death.)",

        "text": "In the early 2000's, I was a floor installer for new homes. One of the floors we installed was sheet vinyl. Most of the homes by us are built on concrete slabs. Before the vinyl can be installed we prep the concrete for holes, cracks and other irregularities. Most of the time it takes 30 minutes to prep, any thing over that is an extra charge to the builder. This year the vinyl manufactures came out with a new vinyl floor that was very smooth with little texture on it. That means it shows every imperfection in the concrete. We started to get complaints from the new homeowners about high spots low spots in the concrete showing through the vinyl. Long story short the builder blames us and wants us to replace the floor for \"free\" to make the homeowners happy.  We explain that the concrete is the problem and we did not pour the concrete. He said its our problem once we install the floor. Ok then, the next day I go to my next home spending an extra hour with a 10 ft level making every imperfection I can find. I ask the builder how \"he\" wants to fix the floor. He tells me to prep it, I have him sign my work order giving me permission to charge extra for prepping the concrete. We charged $150hr to prep in those days much more now. I spent all day prepping the concrete, later that afternoon the builder stopped by wondering why I was still their. I told him If I was going to be responsible for the concrete, I was going to make sure it was right.  I came back the next day and spent another 4 hrs prepping before going to the builder. I told him I believe its ready for vinyl but I need him to inspect it encase I missed anything.  He walked over to the house and saw all what I did to the floor. I told him If its to \"his\" expectations he needs to sign my work order stating he approves the prep work and I can install my vinyl. He realized I turned the tables on him and reluctantly signed my work order.  I got paid over 12hrs of prep @ $150hr. We never got stuck replacing another floor for free ever again.",

        "text": "Hello, all, I’m a chronic lurker here in the sub, and I think it’s finally time to share my own little bit of malicious compliance from my work.\n\nA bit of background, I work in the Customer Care department (the call center) at a local HVAC, Appliance, Plumbing, and Electrical company. If you’re in the Livingston/Wayne/Washtenaw county area in MI, you’ve probably seen our vans all over the place. \n\nAnd, like most HVAC companies out there, we schedule our service calls based on a priority system. If you’ve ever been asked how old your furnace/AC is, if the company you’re calling installed it or not, they’re trying to find out what priority you are. Our priority list is as follows:\n\nPriority 1 - Our installs and our “priority service perk club” members in a no heat, no cool, or no hot water situation\n\nPriority 2 - Any customer with 10+ year old equipment, any person who’s come into our building’s parts department to request service, and any “employee recommended” customer, must be in a no heat, no cool, or no hot water situation\n\nPriority 3 - Any previous customer with under 10 year old equipment, in a no heat, no cool, no hot water situation\n\nPriority 4 - New customer with under 10 year old equipment in a no heat, no cool, no hot water situation, and any non-emergent calls (ie the unit is noisy or customer needs a tech to change a filter, things that aren’t “oh god it’s 20 degrees out and I can’t get my furnace to work and it’s freezing please help me!!!!”)\n\nNow, this can be a bit flexible, and it doesn’t take things like Carrier’s (the brand we sell) warranty requests into account, but it’s a fairly standard guide so we can get to customers who have already paid us a shit-ton of money and customers who we can sell new furnaces to before handling people who are probably not going to purchase a new furnace through us, ie they’re just gonna want repairs or they'll end up calling their manufacturer to get the repair covered under warranty instead of going through us.\n\nWe also run Monday-Saturday for regular service calls, though Saturdays are usually a lighter day because it’s Saturday and we know our techs don’t want to work a full day on a Saturday (can’t blame them, I don’t either). Each tech usually gets about 3-4 calls on Saturday, vs 6-7 on Monday-Friday.\n\nAlso, all names have been changed for privacy/so I don’t get busted if this gets famous.\n\nNow onto the malicious compliance.\n\nTo set the scene, it’s Saturday morning, around 9AM, and the call center is about five minutes away from getting slammed with calls because it’s the first cold day of the fall/winter in MI (around 30 degrees to give you an idea) and we’re currently accepting Priorities 1 and 2 for Saturdays schedule, all others are being booked out to the following week.\n\nSuddenly, an email pops up from our HVAC manager, Tommy. It says “Per Ken (our owner), we are open to all service calls today.”\n\nWe’re panicking in the office because that means we have to take anything and everything that comes in, non-emergent or otherwise. Our dispatcher, Eliza, texts Tommy to make sure that he’s serious, and it turns out that he is. “Take anything that comes in. We have to be aware that this is one of the coldest days so far and be sympathetic to that,” he replied.\n\nThis isn’t the first time our owner has tried to pull one of those “Say yes to everything!!” moves, and, since our call center manager isn’t answering her phone, we decide to say, “Screw it.”\n\nYou want anything that comes in?\n\nYou got it.\n\nAlmost immediately after he sent that text, we were slammed by customers calling in, mostly new furnaces that were under other companies’ warranties that had no heat, and non emergent calls like noisy furnaces and filter changes.\n\nWe took every single one of them.\n\nBy the time our manager, Meghan, had woken up to see the shit storm (about an hour after Tommy sent his email) we had already filled up the schedule, each tech having about 7 calls each.\n\nUnfortunately, Meghan told us to close the schedule down and book anything else we got in for Monday or after, but that hour of saying “yes” to every customer was cathartic.\n\nPart of me wishes that Meghan would’ve let it continue, because, unfortunately, both Tommy and Ken tend to pull this stuff every time we switch over from heating to cooling, and they need to see what happens when you take everything and “say Yes!!” to every customer’s request. However, I also know that it’s important to get that back on track so our customers don’t get screwed over.\n\nTL;DR: Our HVAC manager tells us to take anything that comes in, we do and end up overfilling the schedule with terrible, poorly-paying calls.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions on any “insider secrets”, I’d love to answer them!! After all, better to be informed when you're going into a home repair sitch instead of finding out you were screwed over after the fact.",

        "text": "I worked in a cafeteria on campus at my university. It was wonderful because I could take shifts around lectures and didn’t lose time travelling. The manager used to sit in her office on the phone or just disappear for long periods of time. I didn’t mind because I liked my other coworkers and she left us alone to do our thing. I always volunteered to do the closing shift because the owner let me take home all the leftover food, it basically kept me and my housemates alive and we were very grateful. \n\n\nThe problem was, on a 5 hour or longer shift, you had to take a 30 minute break. I’d always ask when mine was but she’d always say later, we’re too busy. I’d usually end up just working the whole 5 hours. \n\n\nI didn’t mind until I realised she was only paying me for 4.5! I asked her about it and she said if I didn’t take my breaks that wasn’t her problem. Cue malicious compliance. \n\n\nMy next closing shift was 4.5 hours of opening hours and finished 30 minutes after closing. Everyone else went at 7 and I stayed back by myself to clean everything in 30 minutes. It was a big job but I had it down pat. The entire shift I kept asking her if I could take my break and she kept saying no. So, at 7, I took my apron off and walked out, saying I’ll be taking my break now since we were too busy before. I sat in the cafeteria and watched her clean that entire place. It took her well over an hour. \n\nThe next day she had a break schedule up!",
