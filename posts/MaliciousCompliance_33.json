USA group on the other hand was out whole 8 hours doing same job with just 1 hour break in between for lunch.\nSecond day comes and it's the same but these guys made few jokes how we are slacking!? \nThird day comes around and we are talking now bit more and they start questioning us how are we paid the same but work only 3 hours (that day we even helped them finish up after we completed our project).\nNext day we come in and there is our shift boss in the room.\nAparently these guys felt cheated because we got to do nothing for the whole day and wanted us to get \"writen up\". Shift boss new how we work and always delivered before deadline so he told us that we can go home after we finish work and he'll pay us for whole 8 hours and usa group can can stay there until 8 hours is finished.\n\nTl;dr group from USA came to help with workload and felt cheated because we finish same work much faster.\nShift boss let us go home as soon as we finish while americans got to stay full 8 hours.",

        "text": "I work as an engineer for a food manufacturing company in the UK. If you eat meat bought from any supermarket, chances are it's come through here.\n\nNow the good thing is our internal quality assurance and inspections really are second to none - anything even slightly out of spec is removed, and the cause addressed by a myriad of people, including me, which naturally takes time. This includes machines not working as expected.\n\nSo I came into work one morning, and see 7 or 8 people stood around one of our metal detectors. It's a simple machine, that allows meat to flow through, until metal is detected. At this point, a valve turns and dumps the meat into a reject bin, before returning to it's normal position. The valve can be placed upside down, in which it will just constantly dump the meat.\n\nI approach the gaggle of people to see what's going on. It's an argument - just what we all need at 0530.\n\nHygiene Staff - \"The valve goes *this* way. The engineers have told us it\"\n\nOperators - \"No it doesn't the manager says it goes the opposite way\"\n\nAnd other sentiments to that nature are being thrown by all. I intervene, and confirm that the HS are correct, it fits in that way, and even go on to show them how and why that's the case.\n\nThe manager (M) then turned up, seeing his minions stood about and asked what was going. I quickly briefed him on the situation, but before i could explain why he stopped me and asked his operators. \n\nAfter hearing them out, he demanded I put the valve in as his operators have said, because they, and he, have more experience than me and know what they're doing. This is despite me correcting this exact issue multiple times in the year I've been on site.\n\nI protest, and warn him this will cause downtime on the line when the valve has to be swapped around, paperwork filled out and someone to confirm the meat is ok to go back through. Atleast 30mins, but that's 4 operators and anywhere between 0.5-1 tonnes of meat sat doing nothing. And that's if i don't get called to another job in the meantime.\n\nI was assured this is what was happening. I did as asked. I then emailed him and BCC'd M's manager to CMA.\n\n15 minutes later when the line was trying to run, i get a call over the tannoy to see M.\n\nM - \"The metal detector is broken. I need it looking at.\"\n\nSelf - \"The valve is the wrong way, like i said. You now need to do X,Y,Z and change the valve to how it should be.\"\n\nM - \"i need you to do it, that's what you're here for\"\n\nSelf - \"Im here to respond to breakdowns and carry out maintenance. This is neither.\"\n\nAt this point, I received another call over the tannoy for an actual breakdown. He and his experience were left to correct it, and it took twice as long than if i had done it myself.\n\nM gets questioned by his boss later about the downtime and why it happened. He tried to throw me under the bus and say I installed it wrong. M gets chewed out for lying about it, because the email wasn't seen by only him, and i hear everything from my workshop next door!\n\nI've never had him question my decisions since, and i back everything up with an email and BCC to someone else relevant.\n\n\n\n\nTl;dr - Manager ignores engineer and favours his own experience. Lies about it. Gets schooled.",

        "text": "Format, on phone, all that good stuff. \n\nSetting: this happened about eight years ago when I worked for one of the biggest hotels in the U.S. I’m talking about 3200 rooms and that place is the size of a small city. My position was “supervisor of special operations” which means I was the guy they came to when they needed to, say, change 1000 bed frames for more modern ones, or change 5000 light bulbs for ones more energy efficient because we are going green, and stuff like that. \n\nNow, a hotel this big is divided into four buildings, each with their own managers, supervisors, housekeeping and the like, essentially it was run like four separate hotels. \nThe problem was that each building’s managers had an exorbitant amount of power, and they ended up stepping on each other’s toes day in and day out. \n\nBecause of my position I didn’t work directly for any of them but for the director of housekeeping, or DH(because what I did had mostly to do with rooms) so whenever one of them tried to get me to take special care of them and their buildings I could easily refuse but most of the time I did whatever they needed to get done if I had time and because they were mostly nice people and good managers. Enter douche canoe, or DC, DC was the worst manager I have ever encountered in my career, he would go into the check out rooms and steal tips from the housekeepers, take things left behind by guests instead of reporting them to lost and found, and talk to people like they owed him something, like his word was law. \n\nThe story: One day we get a VIP guest, one of the owners of the company that owned the company that owned the hotel, so DH sends me to check the room he’s to check in to the next day, so I did, I checked all the furniture, bed frame, mattress, lamps, light bulbs, AC unit, everything I could think of and when I’m done I give the good to go. Fast forward a week, the day after VIP checked out, I get called into DH’s office and the conversation goes something like this: \n\nDH: so VIP had a complain about his room\n\nMe: did I miss something?\n\nDH: not really, it was housekeeping who did, he noticed that one of his pillows was stained (the pillows are in a protective cover inside a pillow case so he had to have taken it out of both to notice it was stained) and requested another one, which was also stained. \n\nMe: and you want me to do something about it\n\nDH: I want you to check all the pillows during renovations, and take all the stained ones out of the rooms and send them to laundry and then place them back in the rooms.\n\nMe: that’s gonna take a couple of days and some overtime but ok. \n\nThe hotel was scheduled for renovations about three weeks from the date of the VIP pillow incident, where the hotel was supposed to shut down for two weeks and outside contractors would come in and do most of the work, during this time I was supposed to just stand by and help out the contractors with whatever they needed, but because of the pillow incident I now had something to do. \n\nSo I had my instructions from DH and they date rolls by and me and my team get to work, about half way through the first building, I get a call on the radio from DC asking where I was (DH had had a family emergency and was out of town, leaving DC in charge of overseeing operations until he got back) I respond with my location and get back to work, about ten minutes later DC enters the room I’m currently working in and the conversation goes like this:\n\nDC: you are going to throw away all the stained pillows \n\nMe: now why would I do that when I have clear instructions from DH?\n\nDC: DH isn’t here and I’m telling you to throw away all the stained pillows. \n\nAs soon as he finished the sentence he turned around and started walking away when I said “but”, and then he loses it and goes: YOU ARE NOTHING MORE THAN A GLORIFIED JANITOR, YOU WILL DO AS YOU’RE TOLD, THROW AWAY ALL THE STAINED PILLOWS AND LEAVE THE THINKING TO THE PEOPLE WITH COLLEGE DEGREES. To which I said nothing but “ok”. \n\nAfter he left I call my team on a different radio frequency and let them know the new plan, and get a lot of seriously? And what the fucks? So I tell them: that what the boss man wants and that’s exactly what the boss man will get. \n\nAnyways, we get back to work pulling stained pillows from rooms (remember, 3200 of them) \nSo it takes us about three days, during this time we didn’t just dump the pillows as we went, we stashed them in a storage room by the dumpster (turns out most of the pillows were stained so we’re talking about 15000), so after we are done I emailed DC, and say: all the stained pillows have been pulled and are on stand by, again, should I just take them to laundry like DH originally told me to do, or should I proceed to dump them? To which he replied: yeah whatever just throw the away already like I told you to. So my team and I proceed to ask around the staff and gave a bunch of the away before filling four dumpsters with nothing but pillows. \n\nSo days go by and I’m just helping out the contractors when I get an email from DC saying: why aren’t there pillows in the rooms yet? It was your responsibility. To which I replied: we don’t have enough pillows for all the rooms even with the stash (the stash was a storage room we kept full of new pillows, for whenever they broke, were bled on, or had too many people requesting extra pillows at the same time, but it was only like 500 give or take) we don’t even have enough for even one building. He replied: what do you mean we don’t have enough? How many pillows did you throw away? My response: you told me to throw away al the stained ones so I did, about 15000. To which he replied: 15000?!!!! How could you be such an imbecile? Now what are we supposed to do? We can’t delay the reopening. My response: I’m just I glorified janitor and can only follow orders, I’ll leave the thinking to the people with college degrees,\n\nHe the proceeds to call DH on his personal phone (who was out of town attending his father’s funeral) and belittle me, say how incompetent I am and how I threw away all the pillows I was supposed to have washed and put back in the rooms, so I get a text from DH that just said: DC told me what you did, we’ll talk when I get back in two days. \n\nDuring those two days I compiled a folder with the email thread with the pillow conversation and since I don’t have access to the security mainframe, went to my buddy who is the security manager and checked the cameras and I found the footage of him telling me that I’m a glorified janitor and to leave the thinking to the college graduates (there are no cameras in the rooms but the hallway camera caught the audio). The two days went by and as soon as I came in the next morning and pick up my radio I get a call from DH to meet him in his office, so I head there with my folder and my footage in hand. When I walked in he was sitting in his desk, with DC standing next to him, and the conversation went like this:\n\nDH: take a seat. \n\nSo I take a seat. \n\nDH: would you care to explain this situation you have put us in?\n\nME: no problem. \n\nI pulled out my folder, opened it, put it on his desk and push it towards him. \n\nHe spends a couple of minutes reading it (including the transcription from the security footage), and when I can tell he’s done reading I said: they wouldn’t let me take a copy of the security footage as per policy but you can talk to “insert security manager’s name here” and he can show it to you. He then looks at DC with raised eyebrows, looks back at me and says: would you excuse us for a moment? I just nod, get up and walk out. About 30 minutes later comes out DC with the biggest puppy who peed on the carpet and got hit with a rolled up news paper face  I’ve ever seen, DH signals me to come in again and says: Mr. DC has decided to take some personal time indefinitely, carry on with your day. \n\nAnd that’s the story of how a manager tried to get me fired because of his stupidity and it didn’t work. \n\nTL;DR\nAsshole manager tries to get me fired because of something he told me to do, gets fired instead.

I usually cook 1.5 cups of rice for us and it suffices for the whole day with some milk, fruits and a side dish. This one particular day I added more vegetables and our stomach was filled which led to some rice being left over at the end of the day. My colleague is very particular about wasting food. I hate to waste food as well, I’ll keep it for the next day. But he wants freshly cooked food EVERYDAY. No biggie. So here’s how the conversation went. M : Me &amp; C : Colleague\n\nM : Hey, some food is left over from morning. Wanna share? \n\nC : *drinking beer*nah. I’m good.\n\nM : just a spoon. I ate and am full. One spoon and you won’t go fat. You’re handsome already. \n\nC : nah man. Why do you suffer so much? Stuff into your mouth and struggle to eat?\n\nM : alright. No biggie. I’m eating it. Not wasting food. \n\nC : hey, you know what the problem is? you cook too much food. Cut it down. \n\nM : sure. But just one day. That’s fine. I’m eating it now. \n\nC : No. You cook just 1 cup tomorrow. \n\nM : *horrified* you sure? It’s too less for both of us. \n\nC : yes. You use 1 cup. That’s it. \n\nM : okay. \n\n*then I finish the food &amp; retire into my bedroom*\n\nI call my mom and ask what to do. Because I sure as hell know that 1 cup won’t be sufficient for both of us. Even with the added vegetables and all. \n\nMom was like : *just do it. He will realise not to poke his nose in something he has no idea about.*\n\nMe : *evil smile on face*\n\n**next day**\n\nI wake up as usual early, however,  I just cook with 1 cup, prepare my breakfast and pack my lunch and keep the remaining for his majesty’s consumption. \n\nI retire into the washroom and get dressed and come out. \n\nC : *shocked* why did you cook so little?\n\nM : you said to cook 1 cup. I cooked 1 cup\n\nC : if you don’t want to cook, tell me. Why do this?\n\nM : you said 1 cup. I cooked 1 cup. I told you 1.5 cup is what we eat normally. Yesterday coz of the excess veggies you felt it was more. \n\nC : *defeated face* next time you don’t want to cook, tell me before. I’ll cook. \n\nM : *raising my hands up* I only did what you told me to. \n\nThat day he boiled up some eggs (only thing he knows) ate half a box for lunch and literally starved the day. I took my usual share of food. Not compromising. \n\nI didn’t get any apology tho. But he stopped commenting about me cooking for the rest of the stay. \n\nI felt very bad for doing that. But I had to show him. Didn’t give me much choice. If you’re reading this. I’m sorry man. I only did what you told me to do. \n\n*Peace*\n",

        "text": "Hello everyone, first time poster in here. I’ve been hosting at a southern buffet for three or so years. During this time I’ve seen a lot and most certainly have learned a lot as well, I could go on along list of the shit that has happened and possible make a novel of it. But since nothing unusual (surprisingly) has happened at work recently so I’d thought I’d share this story of when I first started hosting back in 2015 on /taleswithyourserver (cant figure out how to do the proper tag, I apologize for that). Someone said i should share it in here as well and most likely would be well received, so here I am!\n\nNow on a quick note on this story, I absolutely regretted doing this act on this individual as it was totally out of line and absolute spite when I should have got my manager to deal with her instead of taking it into my own hands. It was my first major job and especially dealing with the public so I was very inexperienced in dealing with rude guests. All that being said, on with the story! (Also I apologize for any errors as I’m on my phone typing this)\n\nIt was around 10:00-10:30 in the morning. The breakfast rush had just ended and most of the restaurant had already cleared out. So roughly about 10 people were in the restaurant at this given time. So about this time a lady (maybe 40s-early 50s) comes in, pays, and comes up to the host stand to be seated....and this is where it gets a bit thorny.\n\nM: me and L: lady.\n\nM: hello! How many will be it in your party?\n\nL: looks around, how many do you see?\n\n(Already getting a vibe already she’s going to be Trouble) \n\nM: one\n\nL: then that’s your answer, get me a booth or something I have to go take a shit. \n\nShe, literally, says that to be, leaving me bewildered before walking off.\n\nSo I set the silverware on her booth, and go about my way. She comes back and asks where it is, I point and she goes to it.\n\nA minute later, she comes up to me.\n\nL: it’s to wobbly, can you take me to another booth please?\n\nM: alright\n\nI take her to another booth\n\nL: uh....really?\n\nM: is there something wrong? \n\nL: it’s fucking dirty, look at it! Points to Corner of the table.\n\n....pointing to a single small crum in the corner\n\nM: I apologize, I’ll wipe it off for you (I run very quickly to get a towel.)\n\nL: I don’t smell it.\n\nM: (in my head) Oh shit what now?\n\nM: smell what?\n\nL: bleach, do you not bleach your tables? \n\nM: mam we can’t-\n\nL: I don’t care if you can’t or not. Bleach it! I’ve never heard of a restaurant no using raw bleach on tables to clean them! (Heads on to the buffet)\n\nAt this point it had already been a long morning and I was giving zero fucks for what I was about to do next. \n\nAnd At the time I was thinking she’s either being malicious for shits and giggles or was being ignorant..or both.\n\nSo I head to the back, get a bleach bottle, and pour maybe 2-3 fisr full sizes of bleach puddles on the table and wipe away....needless to say I could barely breath when it was all said and done. Thankfully, where she sat there she was the only one in the section and the rest were to the front. A few people asked where the bleach smell was and I told them I had to clean up an accident.\n\nAll while said lady was coughing away while trying to eat her meal. She ate two plates, left a tip (later to be $20 on a $10 bill) And leaves, staring at me as if I’m the meanest son of a bitch alive, without saying a word. Said server afterwards even asked why I bleached it like that, and I told her the lady asked for it, and she got it.\n\nShe never came back after that. Looking back I absolutely regretted doing it. It was extremely unprofessional and very uncalled for. \n\n",

Tonight I was taking a shower and listening to him noisily bat the plug around on the floor. Like a toddler, it's always comforting to hear him making noise because when he's quiet, you know something is brewing. Of course he falls silent about the time that I cut the water off and I suspiciously draw the curtains back. I'm braced, because this is usually the part where he jumps in the tub and rubs loose fur all over my wet legs and start licking the floor of the shower (he's only just bright enough to wait for me to cut the water off, but it took him a while to learn that step), but it doesn't happen this time.\n\nNo, this time he's sitting on the counter by the sink in my tiny bathroom and making direct eye contact with me.\n\nMe: \"Oliver, what are you doing... whatever you're planning, no.\"\n\nThe cat knocks the tub plug off the counter where he has carried it.\n\nMe: \"okay, now go get it.

        "text": "This is a story from back when I was a sophomore in high school, inspired by a recent AskReddit post about the [worst teacher](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/8rf9ia/students_of_reddit_whats_the_story_of_the_worst/e0rdhi1/) you've ever had. It's actually about my second or third-worst teacher (so hard to choose!), but definitely my most malicious example of compliance as a teenager.\n\nBackground information: I grew up in a rural part of the Midwest and attended a school that was literally surrounded by corn fields on three sides. The district was so sparsely populated that my entire graduating class was only 48 students, and the local economy was mainly based on farming and steadily disappearing factories, so the residents weren't very wealthy. The combination of those two things meant that the school didn't receive much tax funding, which in turn meant that it had a lot of trouble attracting and retaining high-quality teachers. (Somehow still found the money for a new sports field, but I digress.) While I had several good, or at least well-meaning, teachers who taught there because they'd grown up in the area, the majority were either new M.Ed graduates looking for experience before moving on to higher-paying jobs or the borderline-incompetent ones who were transferred from other districts because they couldn't be fired due to tenure and basically did as little actual work as they could get away with.\n\nThe characters: Despite looking alternative/gothy at the time (oh how I cringe looking back on those Hot Topic-filled days!), I always did well in school. I would have been the valedictorian of my tiny class if I hadn't gotten suspended for 6 weeks once, but that's a story for another time (Edit: [story](https://www.reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/8rl1qb/calling_a_bad_teachers_bluff/e0t6ady/) added). I made some money on the side by \"tutoring\" other students, which they usually just took as an opportunity to get the answers, but at least I tried to go step-by-step and teach them rather than just doing their homework for them. This will be relevant later. My friend L, who was also a strong student, has a small part in the story, and let's call the teacher in question Miss P. I mentioned above that many of the teachers were either inexperienced or lazy, but Miss P managed to be *both*. She had originally been hired as the elementary-school nurse, but then the sophomore chem teacher quit at the last minute and the administrators figured \"Well Miss P taught one semester of 4th-grade science, so she'll be a good chemistry teacher, right? Right?\" (Ron Howard: \"She wasn't.\")\n\nThe incident: It would be a stretch to say that Miss P actually \"taught\" chemistry; she just read out of the Teacher's Edition of the textbook, distributed occasional worksheets, and dodged student questions because she didn't know her hydrocarbons from a hole in the ground. Not that people asked very many questions once it became clear that they probably knew more about the subject than she did, which she was perfectly content with. Anyway, one day Miss P was droning on about ionic bonds while I was sitting in the back of the classroom near the lab stations, talking quietly with L about something unrelated to class because we had already taught ourselves the material. Miss P noticed us, however, and called us out on it.\n\n&gt; Miss P: Why are you talking in class?\n\nNote the wording. There wouldn't be a story to tell if she'd said \"Stop talking in class!\" instead, but she went for the rhetorical question. I was more direct than tactful at that age, which led to the first, minor MC:\n\n&gt; Me: It's because we (L and I) already know this.\n\nCue some snickering from the other students. Miss P definitely didn't appreciate my blunt honesty, especially since it addressed the elephant in the room: her (lack of) teaching skills. She could have salvaged the situation for herself by giving me detention for talking in class, or even saying \"Well pay attention anyway!\", but instead...\n\n&gt; Miss P: Oh, if you already know everything I'm teaching, then how would *you* like to teach the class?\n\nI'm sure you can see where this is going. Thus begins the titular malicious compliance:\n\n&gt; Me: Okay\n\nAnd I did. The snickering intensified as I proceeded to walk to the front of the room and, to Miss P's surprise and displeasure, teach a passable lesson on ionic bonding for the last half-hour or so of class. The details are fuzzy now, but I remember drawing Lego/puzzle piece-esque cations and anions on the blackboard to visually show how the total number of charges needed to balance, doing examples that weren't in the Teacher's Edition (such as having one classmate name a cation, another name an anion, and then working out the formula for the compound), and making a dumb joke about [tin oxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tin(II\\)_oxide) and snow. I'm sure I was awkward and disorganized at points, but I was a 16-year-old with no time to prepare, after all. I didn't think about it at the time, but in retrospect I'm sure Miss P was listening for any opportunity to correct a mistake or otherwise put me in my place. Apparently she didn't find any.\n\nThe aftermath: It would be too r/thatHappened to say that my classmates clapped and cheered once I was finished, but a few people did tell me in the hallway afterward that my lesson was a lot clearer than any of Miss P's had been. Let me be perfectly clear here: *that is a very low bar.* To any high schoolers (or reasonably competent middle schoolers) reading this, I'm sure that you could teach a better class than Miss P. She never addressed what had happened, but she tacitly let me talk with my friends in class for the rest of the year. Her contract wasn't renewed after that year, which probably had nothing to do with me, as her position was a stopgap to begin with. In my junior year we had a new teacher, Miss M, who was thankfully friendly, motivated, and competent. She spent most of the first semester of Chemistry II doing remedial work to teach everyone what they should have learned in Chemistry I. Then she left the next year to take a better-paying job in a larger district, but so it goes.\n\n*TL;DR: Bad teacher tried to shut me up by asking if I wanted to teach the class. I accepted.*",

        "text": "I used to work in a call center. If you know the actor Chris O'Dowd from The IT Crowd, Bridesmaids and the new Get Shorty TV series he used to work there (but not at the same time I did) and tells a story about his time there here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bJ4zh0NYEU. It was a charity fundraising call center, one of those that call you up and ask you to give a regular gift, ideally monthly to help X charity... Its no longer around so I might as well name it; Pell and Bales. It went into liquidation 2 years ago after being around about 25 years. If you weren't in when we called (or were just ignoring the phone) they'd call back later, often, I think I saw a 23rd attempt once but that was at the very end of a LONG campaign, but it was usually low teens. They said it wasn't a sales job but it was a sales job. We were often calling elderly people who it was obvious from the get-go they couldn't afford it but you had to ask. You had to ask 3 times. Each time was a smaller amount in the hope you would wear them down. It wasn't pleasant, but apparently, it is the most cost-effective way of fundraising 'apparently', although this accounted for people giving monthly for 4 years, so who knows... It was incredibly boring, and a little soul destroying hence why things like Chris' Tiger Swan happened. We were always trying to find ways to keep ourselves entertained. I once got 26 F1 drivers past and present into a Samaritans (suicide hotline) script because it entertained me and not one person, caller or superior complained. I think the fact I got 4 times the gifts using it helped, even if they had listened to my calls.\n\nI worked there for quite a long time until it destroyed my mental health, I could quite happily blitz and do 57.5 hrs a week when I was feeling good and this allowed me to take December of when my Seasonal Affective Disorder kicked in heavily, although the emotional damage probably knocked it into Bi-Polar Disorder and eventually full-on Depression as well as Anxiety. The night shift was extra well paid and was very quiet as we were calling Canada. Somehow it worked out cheaper for a UK call center to call over the internet than for an internal Canadian one to do it. I saw it as a way to earn more sacrificing evening home time for £15 an hour. So finding things to keep your morale up were important.\n\nWhen I started working there, there was a rule: campaign-related material only on desks. Whilst I wholeheartedly agree with no electronics people weren't allowed puzzle books, newspapers or textbooks. We were often dialing phone numbers that were out or would never pick up - mid-afternoon especially, we could go 20+ minutes without an answer. One late evening in a campaign whilst dredging the last unanswered numbers I actually fell asleep, feet up on the computer tower head back nap. After about 9 or so months there I discovered a trick that allowed you to get the radio between calls and that went around the center like wildfire. (If you are on T-Point log into your phone first before the system and it was there, we were always taught to log in to the system first then the phone. If you work in a call center, try it to see if you have that too)\n\nI say 'had', because as part of the fundraiser reps (they didn't recognize the union which is legal in the UK) that got rid of it. I think part of the fact I found a loophole of malicious compliance with the rules and kept it up was a noteworthy part...\n\nOrigami\n\nI was bored one day and started folding paper (most people doodled on the back of the printed scripts) and eventually I figured out how to make a box using 2 sheets. I initially started making them see how many boxes I could stack on top of each other when I was told to stop using the water cooler cups to do it to stave off boredom (I wasn't at my usual spot and for some reason the trick that allowed me to get the radio on my headset between calls I was at didn't work in this bit of the call center), then I started playing around with the boxes and the bits left over to create a way of connecting them together. I linked these boxes together and my first paper dog was created, I was trying to make a centipede but it was a lot more awkward than I imagined and the dog was created by accident.\n\n\nhttps://imgur.com/xNV9oMj\n\n\nThey were simple and fun to make and could easily be made even whilst on the phone, once you had the muscle memory. Many people asked for one so I did. I started using the printed out pages from the scripts and the charity data packs that we were given in the briefings which were more often than not thrown away. Eventually I had to tell people to save the packs they were given so I had the paper to craft with. I had a Campaign Manager come round once and try to tell me that \"Only campaign-related materials are allowed on desks\" So I took the head off the dog and flicked open the head of the dog and handed him 2/3rds of a script of the campaign I was working on. \"It is campaign-related material, as the rules state. There's no rule about it having to be in a certain shape\". He wasn't being paid enough to care that much so walked away knowing I was yet again with the rules\n\n\nhttps://imgur.com/KxPUuM8\n\n\nI was known for being an 'eccentric' and would often go straight from the evening shift at 9pm to my Uni's fancy dress night which happened once or twice a month. This meant on occasion I was in the call center in costume but it was within the dress code (they tried the day I came in as Beast from X-Men but I bought out the dress code and referenced the line about skin color. I agreed not to come in wearing face paint again but could stay at work that day - The fact I was in a suit probably helped) so they couldn't say anything - especially as people were often there in grungy stuff. I actually went as a cheerleader once (although I only swapped from thin black trousers to a mini skirt and took the t-shirt off to reveal my homemade Cheerleader top in the last 10 minutes. I kept my fake boobs in the fridge, which were Jello in Balloons, and stuffed them up so I didn't have to waste time at the end of the day when no-one would see) but I was walking round in high heels all day to practice (I'm Male) so other guys borrowed the shoes to try them out and were surprised how easily I could walk in them. The fact that I was known as 'a bit weird' probably helped me as I got a half-hearted \"technically you are right\" type of response and I went back to my paper folding\n\nAfter a while, I tried different sized cubes. My basic design was made using 3 sheets of A4 but I halved it so had 6 sheets of A5 to play with as it allowed small sweet paper animals to sit on the desk as something cute to have on there as we weren't allowed to decorate our desks, especially as most people chose a different one each day, I just liked the same one as it had quick access to the kitchen to make tea (I'm English some its almost required) and in my personal sweet spot of the air conditioning as different places had different temperatures due to managerial preferences. The cleaners didn't throw them away either as the basically vacuumed and were told not to touch the desks in case something needed was binned.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/BV7hTzV\n\n\nIt was around this time the meeting of the fundraiser reps was coming up and I put my plan into action. I wound up making dogs of different sizes. I gave them to lots of people so they were all over the call center, anyone who asked got one. Campaign Managers could always see one or two looking around. I started experimenting with different animals I did a pig, then a magpie/turkey thing (although the original plan was a peacock using concertina for the tail, but it didn't work as I had hoped) I finally figured out my centipede, a rabbit sitting up on its hind legs and finally a giraffe. Well attempted giraffe, in the end, it became am 18 inches tall(ish) Brachiosaurus. It had a body from A3 paper, a neck and legs from A5 and an A4 head At some point, managers came over and asked me to get rid as they 'did not comply with the rules' so I grabbed a cube flicked it open to show my script. \"Scripts and campaign-related materials are allowed\" they knew I was right so they couldn't get me. Being one of the more creative reps stood me in good stead even though I'd only been there a while and was well past my probation and was consistently in the top 20% of people getting gifts with a 'wrap' time well under target.\n\nWe got the books/newspapers we wanted at the next Reps meeting. The menagerie of animals disappeared and was replaced by an Evening Standard. I still did the occasional dog though as they helped my anxiety, I still do, as they are cute and if I'm 'glitching' (as I call it) a 15-20 minute dog from a couple of flyers settles me nicely. Other people bought the study materials in so they could do uni coursework. Other people bought coloring books, Sudoku puzzle, and crosswords in, a surprising amount of people bought in knitting and crochet in aswell, card games too, although as long as we weren't gambling whilst playing. There was a noticeable shift in morale, you could see the tension in people bodies lessen. The overall 'wrap' time in the call center dropped about 6% across the board as people weren't taking extended loo breaks as they could actually not be bored to death between calls.\n\nIt's still my joint-favorite thing I did there as a rep, the other was leading the reps in the pay rise negotiations. Reading the City AM and standard taught me about things like tactics, useful managerial speak phrases and the RPI and CPI difference which they tried to use against me but I countered that instantly to some shocked faces as they didn't think anyone would know the difference let alone why they were calculated differently.\n\nI enjoyed being a rep, just a shame the other part of the job broke my brain",

        "text": "Many moons ago, in the long long ago I was a lowly pit tech for an iron ore company.\n\nThe company employed me as a graduate geo/pit tech, and then tacked some other shit onto my job description as well. The economy being what it was at the time, and the iron ore price kamikazeing itself, i didn't have much choice.\n\nIn the geo/field services office there was myself, beth and andy. Andy was(im sure he still is) a pompous prick. He assumed because i was \"only a pit tech\" that i had no geological knowledge, much less a degree. He assumed I was functionally retarded and basically one step up the evolutionary ladder than an amoeba.\n\nPart of my job was sampling blast holes, doing sample sheets, marking out ore blocks, designing ore blocks, ore spotting, helping survey mark up a drill pattern, helping drill and blast load, stem, tie in and fire a shot and some occasional operating. Mainly in a roller or water cart. My low priority duties included cleaning a weigh bridge. Which is a big bridge that road trains pass over when they get loaded with ore from a stockpile before they take it to a rail siding. This is way lower on the list of things than sampling blast holes.\n\nIn steps Andy. He asks me to go clean the weigh bridge. I tell him that I have a blast holes to sample, and that I will do it afterwards. Seems reasonable to myself and Beth. Nope. He tells me under threat of termination that I am to do what I am told. Okay. I go clean the weigh  bridge, which is a shit job. Especially in summer. To give you context of what it involves, imagine scraping a 60m long concrete bridge deck with a shovel, that contains mounds of hardened iron ore. When it gets wet from rain or a water cart, it solidifies into concrete basically. Under the bridge there is a gap about 1ft high, this is where the load cells sit. This gap needs to be kept empty. All in all its a shit job, takes at least 6 hours to do properly, so its usually split over a number of days.\n\nThe fallout from me cleaning the weigh bridge and not sampling blast holes was massive. For starters, if the blast holes aren't sampled they cant be loaded and blasted. Not blasting the holes means we have no dirt to mark up and mine or process.\n\nThe mine ran out of dirt to send to the ROM and waste dump on night shift, so the production crew had to be put on standby.\n\nThen morning came, senior management was pissed, board of directors was pissed, everyone and their mother was pissed. They all looked for who was responsible for this monumental fuck up, and all fingers were pointing at me. I'm pretty certain HR was drafting my termination papers. Andy chewed me out after he received a verbal pineapple from the production supervisor and the mine manager, then he told me to go see the mine manager and the production supervisor.\n\nI enter the office and I am faced with two grim faced, visibly pissed off old men, they ask me what the went wrong, and ask if i realize how big a fuck up this is? In my most innocent, \"i'm just a new person\" voice, I explain that i was just doing what Andy told me. Cue looks of confusion. They look at each other, look at me, and then ask me to fetch Andy. I get Andy, he looks just as confused as the other two. This is beginning to feel like the Nuremberg trial. The Mine Manager says one word. \"Explain\". So i tell them exactly what lead to the events of the mine running out of dirt, Andy said go clean the weigh bridge and to do what i'm told. So I did what i was told. I could hear the tightening of Andy's anus, as well as the audible intake of air it made. The supervisor and manager look at Andy. He begins to try to explain himself but it all comes out as an incoherent mishmash of words. Eventually I am told to wait outside, I can hear them shouting, lots of raised voices. After about 40 mins I am called back in, where I receive a very meek apology from Andy, where he apologizes for the misunderstanding. I correct him and say I understood you perfectly, but I accept your apology nonetheless.\n\nAs we go to leave, the mine manager asks me to hang back and have a chat. He says that I am to never do anything like that again, and if Andy ever says anything like that again, or if i am unsure about anything to come ask him personally and he will sort it out.\n\nAfter leaving the office and beginning my long walk to freedom, I was bought several beers at the wet mess that evening.\n\nTL;DR\n\nGneiss Cleavage\n\n\\*Edited for clarity",

        "text": "Here's a long, and personally satisfying story that I have from my very first job when I turned 16.\n\nAfter ceaseless attempts I finally got accepted by a large fast food chain with an expertise in breakfast food. As to be expected I was aware upon being hired that this is were dreams came to die, there was no creme de la crop employees here and there was lots of shady stuff going on. In fact, the entirety of the reason I got hired was because this place had been robbed several weeks before and turns out half of the employees were involved in said robbery, so they were a little understaffed. I started off working part-time as I was still in school so I only put in 12 - 15 hours a week for the first 6 months. For the next 5 years and 4 months I was technically full-time, but I wasn't, but I'll get to that. Lets begin at my final week of work.\n\nMy manager was overall a nice guy, he liked me because I actually put effort into my work and was always available to be called in. Since he knew I was going on a one week vacation he worked me 117 hours the 2 weeks beforehand. I show back up after my vacation to a boss that is so happy to have his prized worker back and he hands me a 67 hour workweek to make up for the week I was gone. I worked 14 hours that first day I was back, and was also given my check for the previous week.\n\nThe problem is we were paid weekly, I was out of state all of last week, and my boss just handed me a check for working 40 hours for a week I wasn't in the store. By 'check' I mean cash, we were always paid in cash, because we're shady. I got home and immediately called my manager to ask why I was given a check for a week I did not work and he says, and I quote\n\n\"Don't worry about it, if anyone from corporate calls you just tell them what they need to hear.\"\n\nThis was his catchphrase for 'I'm doing illegal shit, don't rat me out or I'll throw you under the bus.'\n\nNow my boss had done plenty of shady shit like this to me since I'd been employed here, but this was just carelessness that was painfully obvious. He was banking on me taking the cash and if I got called by corporate making stuff up when he would have thrown me under the bus and got me fired and worse, as he's done this before.\n\nLet the fun begin, the malicious compliance.\n\nI told him not to worry, that I would have everything under control, because I did. We didn't have time stubs or any type of sign-in sheet outside of the one wired into his computer, one he could freely manipulate at any time. Well I didn't like that so from day 1, I kept personal track of when I clocked in, clocked out, what job I did, what the pay rate for said job was, and totaled my gross salary every night I got off work. I did that religiously every day for 5 years and 10 months.\n\nI also kept every paycheck, even the ones I had to fight him to give to me, I always compared my times to his, kept track of all deductions, and left a star by every single one that was incorrect in some way, be it time tampered with, abnormal deductions, etc.\n\nWell the next day, an hour before I'm scheduled to come in corporate comes calling, they couldn't help but notice that I had accepted a check for 37 hours I didn't work from the previous week, and asked if they could send a representative to talk to me about it, they also informed me that this wasn't the only infraction against my profile, that they had had me on watch for about 6 months. I gladly informed them that I was expecting their call and would happily go over ALL occurrences with anyone they sent. I was informed to show up for work, that I would get paid to sit down and talk to this person while I went over the occurrences on file.\n\nLucky me I had every occurrence that had ever happened in my own personal files, that I made copies of with explanations under each error as to why it had been made. So I waltzed in to my place of business at 6 am and clock in, to be greeted by the regional manager; my bosses, bosses boss, a man that I knew well and was so satisfied to see. Before he even sat at the table with me I pulled out my briefcase with all of my records, and my paycheck from the week I wasn't in state.\n\nTo say he was shocked was an understatement.\n\nMy records pointed out even more mistakes than theirs. We went over every minute that was shaved off my time, every hour of overtime that was moved to a different week, every shift that I mysteriously covered, times when my 'food tax' would spike, times when the insurance I didn't have was deducted, raises that were not honored, bonuses that I 'claimed', the whole nine yards.\n\nAbout halfway through my records my boss comes in, an hour and a half late, and see's his star employee going over records with his superior and instantly turns white, and runs to his office. After 5 hours of discussions we come to an understanding that after 5 years and 10 months of employment, rather than me owing the business $1,054.43 that the business owed me roughly $8,567.78.\n\nHe asked me why I waited so long to contact him about it an I replied that I was too scared for so many years, and was simply waiting for my boss to slip it up big time so that if anyone came asking I could hammer the nails in the coffin. He bought me lunch, and wished me a good day while he went to talk to my boss.\n\nAs I was eating I could hear my boss screaming that there was no way my records were true, that I must have made them all up, when his own system records couldn't even go back as far as mine or corporate records. When I got back home I got called by one of my co-workers asking me what had happened, that about 15 minutes after I left the place was shut down for an investigation by corporate.\n\nAll employees were let go from that location and select few were re-hired after the investigation was over. I never got that money, but at that time in my life I didn't really need it and just considered myself lucky to finally be free from it all after almost 6 years.",

        "text": "So this happened about a year ago, I was asked to be a ref at a practice (field hockey) match between our first mens team and some other team from the same region. I was really reluctant as this meant not drinking beer for 80ish minutes with my friends, however I agreed anyway.\n\n\nAs it is a friendly match, I just grabbed my whistle and phone and the match started. About midway through the game, one player from the other team is getting frustrated as his team is losing. This always happens however he is getting very vocal whenever I make a decision his disagrees with or I miss something. \n\n\nNow keep in mind, this is a friendly practice match between these two teams, not a competition match. At one point this guy crosses the line and I call him over. At this point I wanted to give him a green card, which is the final formal warning and comes with a 2 minute time pentaly, which I was not intending on actually doing.\n\n\nHowever, this guy decides to ignore me while calling him over despite making it very clear he's the one I want to have a word with. He comes over cussing at me about me not doing my job at which point I lose my patience. I tell him very clearly that I will not allow his behaviour during this match and hereby give him a yellow card and 5 min time penalty, which is the minimum.\n\n\nSmall note about field hockey rules, it is stated in the rules that if a ref does not have physical cards on him, the ref is allowed to state verbally which card he gives and why. However this idiot starts shouting at me that he will not accept his penalty as I dont have cards and will only accept him if I show him one. At this point he starts walking away and my malicious compliance starts...\n\nI stop the timer and leave the field and ask around if anyone has a set of cards in their bag. Sure enough someone pulls out a set and hands it to me. I call over this idiot again, tell him I now have cards and ask if he will accept the card I give him. He says yes, and I pull the red card out of the packet, tell him to leave the field and wait inside the chancing room, as I am allowed to by the rules.\n\nNeedles to say, match went smoothly afterwards.",

        "text": "Relevant bit of background: I'm a retail manager. The company I work for leases space from another store, which means that I have my own corner of the store over which I am god, and nobody else has any say. As I am one of the smallest locations for my company, I see my boss 3-4x a year, and am mostly left to my own devices. The store manager of the store we lease space from is not my boss, and she cannot write any of us up or fire us without going through me (or my boss if she wants to write me up). My boss and I get along well. The store manager and I do not.\n\nThe store I am in has one of the worst \"scores\" via their rating system of any in their district. It's abysmal. Like 10% of what it should be. The managers are very touchy about this. About 10 days ago, I got a rather rude customer, who wanted help with an item from the main store. Usually I help out, but I was in the middle of something and I had no idea where the item she wanted was, so I sent her to the other counter to wait in line for an actual employee of that store to help her.\n\nLong story short, this lady wrote a long complaint about me and the associate who ended up helping her, about how we were rude and didn't do our job, blah blah blah. Typical retail complaint. In this bogus complaint she said that both of us were standing behind the counter doing nothing, rather than help her. One of the managers of the main store, who I'm really not fond of, came to talk to me about it about a week ago.\n\nI told her what really happened, she didn't believe me. She told me that she's seen me with her associates in the past, and that from now on I'm not to help out with their stuff, and to stick to my own area. They're much busier than I am. It's not uncommon for me to have no customers and them to have 8. And usually, I help with the spillover. She's not my boss, in fact she's in a lower position than me despite being twice my age, but what did I say to Mrs. TerribleManager? \"Ok.\"\n\nIt's been a week, and I'm enjoying rejecting every customer that comes for help with items that aren't mine. I've instructed all my associates to do the same. The store is understaffed as it is, and without my help people are complaining even more. I look forward to see how long it takes her to come back and apologize, because I'm sure as hell not going to. The ratings continue to drop. I'm considering starting to advise every customer that comes to me for help to file a complaint about the lack of staffing.",

        "text": "A few years ago I worked for a company which outsourced inventories for retail stores. Company minivans were used to get to the store from the local office, since it could be a few hours drive. One way to make more money was to drive : the driver was paid hourly at his regular rate while passengers got a (very low) distance bonus, so I managed drive often. An unofficial understanding was that you are not to fuck with the driver since he/she is still technically on the clock. Hence, any passenger preferrence in music was superseded by the driver own taste. There were drivers who didn't want music at all, some who played their own rap demo in a loop, some who listened only zouk, some who just used any major radio station as a background noise... Nobody had any problem with that, and if they had they checked beforehand not to get in that car.\n\nThis worked well for everybody... But the few metalheads, because everyone knows it's not *real* music, and you can't even understand the lyrics, etc... Very funny when those saying that are so bad at English they can't even understand [this song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okeDc2eSJxE&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1m28s). As a metalhead I know some styles are hard and unpleasant to listen for an untrained ear, and I tried to go with easy listening artists, like some ACDC songs your hear in any major blockbuster nowadays. Always to get the same outcries.\n\nGrowing tired of it, I decided to take extra care in selecting what CDs to bring. The first was from [Black Bomb A](https://youtu.be/S0iVkL8EFPk), and instantly created a real outrage, as I expected. My passengers were three girls in their early 20s (the kind to think high of themselves since the male managers where nice to them...) and two guys I didn't know well then. The girls were vehement about me not \"pissing them off with my music again\" so I proposed to switch to some popular electro and they gladfully agreed.\n\nThe second CD was [The Prodigy's World on Fire Live at Warrior's Dance Festival](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNCdvPemr48&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=11m11s)... The girls were expecting some kind eurodance popular in clubs at this time, so for them this was from bad to worse ! But before they could say anything, I ear one of the new guys in the back of the van :\n\nGuy : Hey ! Is this Prodigy ?\n\nMe : Yeah ?\n\nG : It's a CD, right ?\n\nM : Yeah ?\n\nG : So you have the booklet ? Can I look at it ?\n\nM : Sure !\n\nTurning to one of the girls in between us :\n\nM : Can you pass it to him please ?\n\nHer face was priceless, and I'm pretty sure she and her friends took care not to ride with me after that !",

        "text": "Please excuse any violations as this is my first post on Reddit. \nThis is a true story that happened to my family many years ago.\n( I'm old so bear with me, it's a bit long but the payoff is worth it.)\n\nThe year was 1987/88 and I was a college senior. My brother is three years younger than I am and was a sophomore in high school. My parents had just finished remodeling our home especially the kitchen and bedrooms and had taken a trip to Florida. My brother decided to have his girlfriend over for dinner and decided to cook her french fries. Now, the new stove was some sort of 80's ceramic cook-top. I cannot remember the brand name but I do remember you could not tell if the stove was on or off except for an orange light. These kind of stovetops only heat the pan - there is no gas or electric burner. You literally cannot tell if the stove is on other than putting your hand on it. It's ridiculously stupid design and probably not made anymore ( its wasn't induction). So my idiot brother, pours oil in the pan to makes the FF's and either forgets to turn the stove off or doesn't see the orange light that it is still on. He goes into the other room to get laid. ( there is great family debate about this to this day)\n\n\nDid you know that hot oil doesn't not evaporate? It just keeps getting hotter. Well the oil eventually explodes all over the brand new cabinets and immediately sets the kitchen on fire. Bro has just enough time to grab the dog, gfriend and call fire dept before running out of house. Fire dept is amazing and knocks fire down after only burning out the brand new kitchen and dining room. Significant structural and smoke damage but house is still intact.   \n\n\nOh, This is all happening while my folks are on a plane back from Florida. \nI won't get into what happened to bro but suffice to say, he had to hide in the woods for a few days.\n\n\nNow this is where it gets good. My crazy ass father has a giant filing system, all paper where he has the giant metal racks in the basement where every fucking thing ever purchased is in an accordion file on the metal shelving in some sort of ridiculous filing system that only he can use.  EVERY. FUCKING. RECEIPT. Since 1963. The Vogons would be proud. \n\n\nSo once the dust settles, my father calls the insurance company to file a claim. \nAs we all know, insurance companies tend to be large, greedy, bureaucratic shit shows with zero interest in helping people. Insurance company starts asking for receipts. All of them. Father goes into his filing system from hell and begins producing every single receipt the insurance company asks for. Now understand that the house is unlivable at this point. The smoke damage was pretty severe. And they are stalling. Finally, they come back with an offer that is ridiculously low. Now, my father is not a calm person and hates insurance companies and lawyers more than anything. As a very successful businessman, he has had his share of lawsuits and takes particular joy in suing crooked lawyers and  insurance companies. So he goes nuts when they make this lowball offer and immediately files suit against them for violating the homeowners policy. In the meantime, he has to find suitable living arrangements fro family, deal with agents, get contractor estimates, etc. \n\n\nI asked my father why he didn't just take the money and being rebuilding. He says \"these fuckers do this to people all the time and people have to take the money in order to rebuild but I'm going to fight them\" So he begins painstakingly researching the policy with his broker. \n\n\nFast forward a few months and I'm home for the summer and to work on rebuilding the house. The entire family is working on the house when there is a knock on the door. My brother answers. The guy says \" Are you X, my brother says \"Yes\". \" \"Consider yourself Served.\" The look on my brother's face was priceless and we were hysterical. He didn't understand and my father says, \" I am suing you\".\nMy father sued my brother for negligence. The same insurance company provided us with the contents policy as well as homeowners insurance. See where this is going? The insurance company would have had to represent my brother under the Homeowners policy.\nThe insurance company called the NEXT WEEK. Settled the case in full. The next year insurance law in my state was permanently changed to prevent that from ever happening again!\n\n\n\n\nEdit : I just searched the local newspaper archives and the fire took place on 4/22/87. This would have made me a Jr in college and my brother a senior in high school. \n\nFollow up to original post: So I just spoke to my Pop. Here are a few more details to the story. For those saying the story is not true because a policy is a policy and it’s all spelled out, the fact that he had every receipt is important because after he produced all of them, the insurance company literally said, “we are not paying you the final 20k of the claim, sue us”\n\nThey knew it would cost him about that much to file suit. So he wasn’t having any of that bullshit. If you think about it, insurance company screwing policy holders like that would save them a ton of money. And most people would simply settle. \n\nBack in 1987, you absolutely could sue a family member for negligence under the same insurance company that had multiple policies on your home. The insurance law , rule, policy whatever loophole he found, was changed forever in my state after that suit.\n\nThey didn’t settle the next week, his lawyer got a call the next DAY!\n\nI did ask if he had a copy of the suit, there was a long pause as if he was mentally finding a triplicate form, “I don’t think so” he said. I would have him asked the law firm he used, but he ended up suing them ten years later on a different matter..lol...and yes he won...\n\nHappy Father’s Day!",

        "text": "LTL, FTP\nRoughly 20 years ago I worked for an independent mortgage house, meaning they weren't attached to a bank to fund loans. Though this company is now defunct, it was one of the largest mortgage lenders in the country at one point. This company made their money by selling the loans which they had funded to a loan servicer who would collect the payments.\n\nI worked for one of the offices that prepared a certain, special type of loan to be ready to sell to the servicer. The loans I had to prepare were originated at independent branches throughout the country. I never had any responsibility for the condition in which I received those loans, my job was to scan the loan folder for missing documents. So basically, I receive a loan from the branch and evaluate what's missing on the back end of the sale. Then, I prepare a report for EACH missing item on that loan. This report is called an LPN, for Loss Potential Notice, which means we will lose the ability to sell that special loan to the servicer if we cannot collect that missing loan document. The lost revenue will count against the branch that originated the loan. It is my job to then send the LPN to the branch so they can forward me the missing documents via our free internal mail service.\n\nAnd now for the MC. I received a batch of loans made through this special loan program from a branch office in a very cold, northern state. The kind of cold that must have frozen the common sense out of this particular Very Important Branch Manager (VIBM).\nApparently, the VIBM did not know that all of the loans in this program required the documentation which proved that the client qualified for this special loan, for short the QD  (qualifying document). How that information escaped him during branch manager training school is beyond me.\n\nSo every loan in this program at VIBM's branch is missing the QD. For which I create the LPNs. All said and done, I had a little over 100 for a 4 month span of VIBM's lending activity. Since I've never had this many LPN's for one branch before; I did two things. I told my boss and her boss and then I called VIBM to do him a solid and let him know what was up. My boss knew this guy was a pain so she came and listened while I called.\n\nMe: Hi VIBM, I have a large number of LPNs for missing QDs. I think that someone in your branch might be forgetting to reque.....\n\nVIBM: Do not waste my time. No one ever calls for LPNs. I run a multimillion dollar branch and I'm too busy to deal with a few routine missing items. Just fax me the LPNs and my staff will deal with it.\n\nMe: Sir, there are quite a few...\n\nVIBM: Just fucking fax them (click)!\n\nI looked at her and said, I have some faxing to do. She just grinned.\nSo on a 1996, thermal paper fax machine I sent him 200+ pages of LPNs. It burned through 2 rolls of his expensive paper and tied up his line for the better part of 1 to 2 hours. He called my boss sputtering that I was an incompetent, time wasting, asshole. My boss always had my back and she simply asked him why he'd hung up on me when I had tried to warn him. \nShe told her boss, the VP of loan sales for the entire company and she wrote him up for failure to comply with loan filing requirements. (1 step before firing, if you're a branch manager). It was a beautiful day!",

        "text": "This is long, but hopefully worth the read. The dates are estimated to help with the timeline, and names are of course fabricated.\n\nA few years ago, I worked for a furniture company. We were entirely online-based, selling only beds and sofas, and had just begun to move towards a made-to-order business model. This increased our product lead times significantly, as it took our suppliers about 3-5 weeks to build and upholster a sofa from the time we put in the order. \n\nThe reason for moving to made-to-order was so the customer could choose different fabrics for the furniture. We had a list of 100+ fabrics that we could use. But often that wasn't enough for people, so we also offered a \"customer's own fabric\" (COF) service, for when someone wanted to order a 2-seater sofa upholstered in cartoon dicks and balls (this actually happened once - on a $1000 sofa). For COF orders, the lead time didn't start until the day we received the fabric, and added an extra 2 weeks to production (so 5-7 weeks). COF also came with a long list of terms and conditions, including full payment up front, and only a 50% refund (and fabric not returned) if the order was cancelled anytime before delivery.\n\nOne of my jobs was to take the orders from interior designers. Most were professional and great to deal with. However, others were super needy, demanded constant updates, \"trade discounts\", and often wanted their furniture delivered yesterday, as they always seemed to be \"working to a tight deadline\" and couldn't grasp the concept of a lead time.\n\nOne of my customers was a Junior Interior Designer (Jude) at a medium sized interior design firm with around 10 staff. She was very friendly - we got along really well and had a good working relationship. On the other hand, her Managing Director (Maddy) was a complete bitch. She was constantly complaining about our lead times, the quality of our products, and anything she could think of. Jude always complained about being overworked by her, and she treated her staff like rubbish. Despite constantly complaining about us Maddy continued to use us, and by what Jude said, we were one of their preferred suppliers.\n\nJude emailed on 1 June asking for a quote for a COF order of 9 sofas (about $15,000 worth). I emailed her the terms and conditions, and reminded her that because it was in her own fabric, the order would have a lead time of 5-7 weeks, and because it was such a large order, it would most likely be delivered towards the end of that time. She said that was pushing it a bit tight with her deadlines, but she'd be in touch.\n\nLater in the day, I got a call from Maddy.\n\nMaddy: \"We're going ahead with the order, but you'll have to make if faster. We need it in 6 weeks by 12 July for the opening of a new hotel.\"\n\nMe: \"That's great, but we can't guarantee it'll be ready in 6 weeks. Like I told Jude, it'll be 5-7 weeks, but likely closer to the 7 week end of the lead time (19 July). And it's 5-7 weeks from when we receive the fabric, not from when you pay. Instead of using your own fabric, you could use one of our 100+ fabric options, and it'll be delivered in 3-5 weeks.\"\n\nMaddy: \"I can't possibly do that, this fabric is central to the whole design! I'll order the fabric from my supplier today, and we'll look forward to getting the sofas in 5 weeks.\"\n\nMe: \"But I just told you...\"\n\nMaddy: \"No, it's fine! We'll take that risk. Goodbye.\"\n\nI sent Maddy the full terms again, a written reminder of the risks, and payment details.\n\nWe received the full payment for the order, and the fabric arrived with our suppliers a week later (8 June). I got a call from Jude.\n\nJude: \"Maddy wants an update on the order.\"\n\nMe: \"The fabric arrived today, so it'll be 5-7 weeks from today (12 July to 26 July).\"\n\nJude: \"That's going to be tight with our opening on 12 July.\"\n\nMe: \"As I told Maddy, it's super unlikely we can make that date, but obviously we'll do what we can. I'll let you know when we have an expected delivery date.\"\n\nA week later (15 June), we got an update from the supplier saying the order would be delivered on 24 July. Maddy called as soon as I let them know.\n\nMaddy: \"This is completely unacceptable, we are one of your biggest customers and this cannot be late!\"\n\nMe: \"It's not late. As I tried to make clear to you earlier, we were always unlikely to meet your deadline and there's not much we can do.\"\n\nMaddy: \"You should be putting it to the top of your order list! We are a priority! I could make a sofa in 2 days!\"\n\nMe: \"Sorry, but that's not how it works. We can't intentionally delay other customers' orders, it's against our policy.\"\n\nMaddy started yelling unintelligibly, and hung up on me. The next day, I got an email saying that she's looking for other suppliers and \"if you don't hear from me by the end of today, cancel my order.\"\n\nI didn't hear from her again that day, so the next morning I cancelled the order, left a note for the supplier to send the fabric back to her if they hadn't already cut it, and issued a 50% refund.\n\nA few days later (20 June), Maddy called up outraged.\n\nMaddy: \"What is my fabric doing in my design room?! You're meant to be making my sofas!\"\n\nMe: \"You asked me to cancel the order if I didn't hear from you. Luckily the suppliers hadn't cut it yet and were able to send it back.\"\n\nMaddy: \"But I still want the sofas - we'll have to delay the opening until the end of July, but we can manage that now.\"\n\nMe: \"Well in that case, we'll need full payment again, and the lead time will start from the date we have received full payment and the fabric. So they should be ready by around the middle of August if you get the payment and fabric to us as soon as possible.\"\n\nShe went absolutely crazy, telling me she'd ruin us, and asking for Manager's contact details. I passed on all of the email evidence, which absolved me of the blame. She cut a deal with my Manager that basically gave her another 25% of her refund back, and she proceeded with the order, to be handled directly by my manager (so I had nothing to do with it!).\n\nI never had to deal with Maddy again, but I spoke to Jude a few weeks later. She had spent days trying to find a supplier that would make her 9 sofas in her own material in 4 weeks. Apparently it wasn't possible, which is why she came back to us with her tail between her legs.\n\nAs for the order, when the fabric got sent back, at some point the labels got mixed up, which resulted in the wrong fabric going onto the wrong sofas. Luckily our supplier had photo evidence, so we didn't get the blame. But I was quite satisfied on hearing it set their project back about a month and a half, and we weren't at all to blame.\n\nAnother positive to this story was that we stopped doing COF orders. Our management team decided it was too much hassle for limited reward. So this is the reason there'll be no more penis sofas from that company.",

        "text": "My last post when I was a lowly peon got some traction, so I figured I'd share a story from when I was higher up on the totem pole.\n\nAfter grad school I went to work in a field where you had to have a graduate degree to go into management. I worked a few years getting experience at smaller jobs, and eventually got hired at a bigger place where I was running an entire department. Because of that grad school requirement I was way younger than the people I'd be managing, but that was no big deal for me. I'd been at it for a few years and had had pretty good experiences managing a small team.\n\nThen I met Craig. Craig had been working at my new job for about a decade, and he'd been shuffled between various departments because he had issues with everyone he worked with. I guess for the past decades managers were either intimidated by him or figured it'd be easier to make him someone else's problem rather than have a confrontation.\n\nNo one told me about this history when I was hired on. Later I was told it was because they \"didn't want to influence my opinion,\" but I'm pretty sure everyone was happy the new guy would have to deal with Craig for awhile.\n\nAnd everything was fine for a little while. He was on his best behavior when he started, but eventually he fell back into his old ways once he got comfortable with me. I was a pretty easygoing manager and gave my people room to do their job without micromanaging, and maybe he mistook that for being a pushover.\n\nOne fateful day I was out in the department and we had someone from another part of the building subbing in because a worker was out. That's when the incident happened. I overheard Craig berating this poor woman for \"doing her job wrong.\" She wasn't doing her job wrong. She just wasn't doing it the way Craig wanted it to be done.\n\nI take the lady aside and ask her if she felt threatened. She seemed hesitant but said yes. So I call Craig into my office and start with a friendly chat telling him that kind of behavior isn't cool. He can't order people around and he certainly can't have that kind of attitude in a professional setting, the usual first warning stuff.\n\nI figure that's where it ends. Hoo boy was I wrong. Craig blows up. Tells me he's been there for a decade. That no manager has ever dared to talk to him like that. That I'm young (two decades younger than him) and if I know what's good for me I'll quiet down and let the adults handle things. He finishes by smiling and saying the words that ultimately sealed his fate.\n\n\"I dare you to write me up!\"\n\nI reiterated that what he did wasn't cool, that he didn't talk to workers or managers like that, and asked him to get back to work. This had started as a friendly verbal warning, but shit just got real.\n\nI walked over to the building manager's office with my notes. Including everything Craig had said to me and to his fellow worker. Her eyes bugged out and this is when I learned Craig had been a problem no one wanted to deal with for a decade. I told her I didn't care, and it was write up time.\n\nCraig was pretty quiet when he was called into the top manager's office later that day. His eyes were down as he signed his written warning, the first one anyone had ever given him, and that was that. Dare me to write you up after yelling at me when I'm trying to keep things low key and professional? Okay buddy.\n\nUnfortunately that wasn't the end of it. Craig fell into a pattern where he would push the limits and do things he got away with under his old managers. Coming in late all the time. Outbursts against other department managers in front of the whole organization because he didn't like something they were doing. Gossiping with one of his BFFs about confidential information regarding other employees using a thinly veiled code (found that one when he accidentally sent one of those emails and not his friend who had a name very similar to mine).\n\nAnd each time his paper trail got thicker and thicker.\n\nIn the end he was let go. He'd been pushing people around for ten years, and he lasted about six months once he was working under someone who wasn't intimidated by his song and dance. The sad thing is if he could've taken some constructive criticism and not blown up he'd still have his job. He was good at what he did on the public facing side, but couldn't overcome his anger management issues dealing with coworkers.\n\nTL;DR: Workplace bully finally gets a supervisor who's disinclined to acquiesce to their angry outbursts. Sarcastically dares said supervisor to write them up and gets their heart's desire.",

        "text": "**TL;DR: deputy project manager denies my request to order 14 tonnes of materials and costs the company $250k in air frieght**\n\nEdit: BB is Big Boss, boss of the pipelines for the mother company and MB is my boss who was never around and just let me do my thing. Sorry, I thought I put that in the story.\n\nThis one just popped into my head yesterday but is from 2013. Kinda long.\n\nBack then, I was working on one of the bigger pipeline projects in Australia, I don't want to say the companies involved but most people in the industry, especially the people that worked on it, would know it when I say the nickname for it was Mountains of Cash Just Vanish. My job was to place orders for consumables, I would place an average of somewhere around $1mil/AUD of orders every 4 weeks so not a huge amount in the grand scheme of the several billion dollar job but a decent amount.\n\nThe process was I fill out a request for materials form and have it signed off by the project manager (PM), he was a no nonsense guy and he was aware that I knew what I was doing and trusted me so sort of let me go about my business and never really questioned anything that looked legit at first glance, when he was away his underling would come in and fill in as Deputy Project Manager (DPM), this guy would question every little thing to the point I would not buy anything that wasn't urgent just to not have to deal with him. \n\nAnyway, one of my jobs I was designated, was to place the next order for welding rods. Due to the amount we would buy and the process of how we had to buy them involved us needing to buy from the all same batch with all sorts of certificates for quality purposes so we would have to buy them directly from the manufacturer in the United States. This process was quite time consuming and was a 4 month process from filling out the request through to delivery of goods.\n\nThe time came to kick off the order process, PM was away for several weeks for whatever reason and DPM was in his place. I fill out the materials request form and take it to DPM for approval, the order was for 14 tonnes of welding rods with a 7 figure total amount and the conversation went like this:\n\n\n&gt;Me: Hi DPM, this is for the next batch of rods, can you sign off on this so we can get the order on the next ship out of the States so it gets here on time?\n\n&gt;DPM: Wow! That's way too much at this time, we don't need them for 4 months, come back then.\n\n&gt;Me: We need to order these now or it's going to cost $250,000 in air freight so they get here on time if we order them later.\n\n&gt;DPM: No, I won't sign, come back later.\n\n&gt;Me: OK, see you later.\n\nSo me knowing how this is going to play out in 3 months when PM gets back, get straight back to my office and email DPM and say exactly what I said in his office to establish a paper-trail to cover my arse. I repeated this 2 times more until the cutoff for shipping.\n\nSure enough, 3 months later I have this to deal with:\n\n&gt;MB: Hi Scusi, Where's the welding rods you were asked to order?\n\n&gt;BB: This is unacceptable, your negligence will hold up the entire job and costs us millions in down time.\n\n&gt;Me: Hi MB and BB, I was told not to order them by DPM, here is the copy of the emails I sent to DPM on (date 1), (date 2) and (date 3). He rejected my request for the materials in his office and he never replied to my requests for approval over email. I can order them now at an extra cost of $250k for air freight and they'll be here in around 10 days but I need someone to OK it.\n\n&gt;BB: Yes go ahead and order them air freight and bring me the paperwork to sign. DPM, I'll be down to see you in 10 minutes.",

        "text": "About 13 years ago, I had to permanently relocate for a family emergency and quit my Network Engineer position with a Fortune 500 company.  The new location was some podunk town with no network engineering positions.  So I took a PC Tech position with the only mid-sized company in town until I could figure out my next employment strategy.  \n\nHowever, this company had a newly-hired \"IT Manager\" who had no IT experience.  As you may know, small towns are notorious for hiring friends with no qualifications.  Anyway, I was okay with the situation because it was positive cashflow.  I tried to help the IT Manager (ITM) as best I could because I knew he had no experience.  He was initially thankful for it, because I made any suggestions behind closed doors and never tried to show him up.\n\nUntil this one fateful day, when the board of directors of this company were having a meeting at 6 p.m. at a local civic center.  The ITM decided he would just give the Vice President who would be attending the projector for the presentation portion and them hook it up themselves.  As any IT person knows from that long ago, having a bunch of 50+ year-olds trying to hook up a PC to a projector and mashing a keyboard combination to get the screen to show while also adjusting for the screen resolution was not going to work AT ALL.  Again behind closed doors, I told this to the ITM, but for some reason, he thought they would be fine.  I literally **begged** him to let me go there to help them set it up.  I would do it for free.  I wouldn't put it in my timesheet.  I told him that someone could get fired over this since this was a board meeting.  ITM finally yelled, \"Don't go to that meeting!\" I'm guessing he didn't want me to hobnob with the board, which was something I had no interest in doing.\n\nSo I left at 5 p.m. and did not go to that meeting, hence the MC, as we all know what then happened (or rather, did not happen). The next morning, the VP e-mailed both ITM and me saying he wanted to see us.  Before going into to see the VP, I told ITM that I would take responsibility for no IT support being at that meeting because I was single at that time and I knew he had a wife and kid.  The ITM didn't think we were being called in about the previous night's meeting.  He was wrong.  The short version result was that neither of us got fired, but we were both told that no board meeting would ever be without IT support again.  Or else.\n\nEPILOGUE:  So for the few months I stayed afterwards, I attended the board meetings at night without a single complaint.  Eventually, I got tired of the ITM's bologna, and resigned.  And since the ITM no longer had me around to cover his inexperience, he was terminated a couple of months later.  The company's employees started calling me en masse after he got fired (because I was the one who always solved their problems), begging me to apply for the newly open IT Manager position, but I had moved on to creating my own anime empire, which is another story.\n\nEDIT:\n\nANIME EMPIRE:  For years, I was AnimeonDVD.com's most prolific writer.  I started one of the country's largest non-school-affiliated anime clubs.  I opened the largest chain of anime stores in southeast America about 15 years ago (yes, 3 stores).  I started 2 anime conventions.  Some of you now know who I am because I think I just doxxed myself.  I'm now the Vice President of Cybersecurity for a Fortune 500 company.

        "text": "This story does not take place today. Or last week. Or last decade. This story took place back in 1997, when I was a 15 year old sophomore in high school with a part-time job at a grocery store. \n\nBeing somewhat poor, we were expected to get jobs as soon as we could. In North Carolina, where we lived, you could get a job at 15 years old, but only certain types of job (retail was fine) and that job came with very very strict limitations. You could only work 18 hours a week during the school year and only three hours a day and you couldn't work past 7pm. During the summer, you could do 40 hours but when school was in session, the law was very clear on how long you could work and when. \n\nOne night during the school year, I was working a few hours after school on the cash register. We were a pretty popular grocery store, so when 5pm rolled around we would get super busy. I was on the schedule for 4pm to 7pm. Originally I was just supposed to be bagging groceries, but one of the cashiers called in sick so I was moved to a register on the express lane. Again, we were super busy, so our floor manager was working the other express lane next to me. At around 6:30pm, I reminded her that I needed to leave before 7pm. She was snarky when I mentioned it to her, but I politely reminded her that I was 15 years old and had to be gone by 7pm. \n\nAs 6:50pm came and went, I (still politely) remind her a little more urgently. She snapped at me and said we were \"really fucking busy\" and I would stay on that register until she could get someone else on it or I could go clock out and be fired. Fair enough. I needed the $5.50/hr, so I stayed on that register just like she told me to. When she finally got someone to come replace me, it was 7:05pm, which was precisely when I clocked out and started walking home.\n\nOne week later, I was clocking in when the store manager, a much older gentleman, took me aside and showed me the (dot-matrix) printout of the previous week's employee hours. He had circled the 7:05pm that I clocked out and asked me what happened. I explained to him what went down, including the manager's name. He just kind of sighed, said he'd talk to her about the law regarding 15 year old workers again, and told me next time to just clock out and leave. Worried I was in trouble, I told him I was just doing what I was asked and trying to be helpful. He told me he understood and I wasn't in trouble. Then he dropped the outcome of the situation on me. Because the manager kept me and I clocked out 5 minutes late, the store was fined $5000. $1000 for every minute past 7pm I stayed. \n\nI had a few more run-ins with that manager over the years, but she never tried to keep me past my hours again.

        "text": "A bit long, but there is a TL;DR at the end. \n\nI used to work for the county government as a clerk. The job itself was fairly routine, a fair amount of data entry, some organization stuff, but mostly just the same thing over and over again. The thing was,  I was very good at it. Not only did I consistently exceed the goals set by my super in my own area, I was frequently asked to assist in other areas while maintaining my own record of accomplishment. (Boasting, maybe, but important to the story.)\n\nMy supervisor was excellent, my department head was cool too. But the Assistant Director (AssD) in charge of our section was awful. She was married to someone rather affluent, so not only did she drive a whole menagerie of expensive cars, wear expensive clothing all the time, but would take extensive vacations to exotic locales. She would strut around the office, passing around picture books from her latest vacation to St. Martin, or her African safari, or her snorkeling in Bali. Basically showing off to all the underlings that would never be able to afford even one of her extravagant vacations.\n\nAnyway. Our state had gone through some budget battles (like they do), and all of our salaries were frozen, the whole office was put into a hiring freeze, overtime was strictly forbidden, and they drastically cut back on our benefits and support budgets (pens, new equipment, etc.). This wasn't really so bad, since the team I worked with was pretty stellar. As long as no one quit. \n\nWhen the first one dropped, we absorbed her work without complaint. It had to get done, and we had enough leeway in our capacity to handle it. Then the second one quit, and suddenly it was a struggle to keep up. At this point, I'm literally doing two people's jobs, and I'm cramming it into the work time allotted. (No overtime allowed, period.)  Of course, all this meant that my supervisor was routinely not doing her job, helping out with OUR job, and then would stay late because she was salaried. \n\nCue the AssD. Even though we worked our asses off to keep up, being two people down meant that we were slowly dropping behind. Our AssD decided, in her infinite wisdom, that the key to turning us around was to simply set the daily goal 20&amp;#37; higher. Her minions were simply not working hard enough in her mind. Of course, this did pretty much the opposite of what she wanted, and our numbers began to fall still further as no one met these new goals at all consistently. (I met it a few times, but gone were my days of exceeding my goals every day)\n\nSo she started micro managing, and writing us up for every minor infraction. Two minutes late from lunch? That's a write up. Failed to meet your goal? That's a write up. No excuses mattered, we got a permanent black mark in our personnel folder. The first time I got written up for being late, I shrugged and went back to work. The next week I was written up again, and  I got miffed. We used an actual punch clock for our time keeping, and at the end of each pay period I had to sign off on my punches. You see, I would routinely clock in 12 minutes early in the morning and 12 minutes late when I left, essentially working for free because that extra 24 minutes actually mattered. I'd do the same with lunch when I could, so I was racking up quite a bit of \"off the clock\" work. (15 minute intervals, but that 15 minute didn't click until the 13th minute. Clock out at 17:12, and it registered 1700 on my pay.)\n\nAssD wanted to write me up for being 3 minutes late coming back from lunch? Ok, I'd add up all the time I worked over. Write me up for not meeting my arbitrary goal? Fine, I'd stop helping my coworkers keep up. \n\nThe next pay period, I did exactly that. I clocked in exactly as I normally did, logging all my extra \"off the clock\" time. I also stopped helping, focusing entirely on meeting my goal. And I did. Mine was the only desk that was on time, everyone else was 4+ days behind. I did exactly what my job description said, and at the end of the week, AssD's numbers were so bad she started getting heat from HER boss. \n\nThat period they paid me almost 6 hours of overtime, and the AssD lifted the mandatory goals. I also never got written up for being 2 minutes late ever again. (I didn't get written up at all, actually)\n\nTL;DR - Budget cuts freezes hiring. People quit, causing us to fall behind. Clueless boss sets unrealistic goals and starts writing up people for minor infractions. I abide by the letter of the law and wind up with overtime- AND the alleviation of the unrealistic goals for my team. ",

        "text": "When I was in middle school in the early 90s, I was just a normal adolescent boy with a bicycle and a powerful desire for a Slurpee. \n\nI lived in a complex of condominiums that were divided into multiple \"courts,\" composed of a rectangle of buildings with gaps in between, allowing for an easy cut through. \n\nI lived in Court 7, and in order to get to the back entrance of the complex, near where the 7-11 was, I had to go around the lake and cut through Court 2. \n\nOn this particular day, though, all the boys that lived in Court 2 were outside in a circle of bicycles. I knew these kids from school, and no one was unfamiliar to me, so my being there shouldn't have been a big deal. In fact, the weirdest thing to me is that before and after the events of this story, we were all sort of friends.\n\nFor some reason, though, the de facto leader, G, came over on his bike to block my path. \n\n\"Where are you going?\" he asked.\n\n\"7-11\"\n\n\"You can't come through here. This is our turf.\"\n\nI believe that, because this was the early 90s, G's attitude was directly attributable to the media's fascination at the time with gangs, colors, turf disputes, and anything to do with that particular flavor of youth violence in general.\n\nIn addition, most of the kids in this complex were children of Eastern European immigrants, and at the time, no one in America--other than the reporters and politicians, of course--seemed to be as fascinated by ideas of American gang culture as many of the Russian, Polish, and Ukrainian children that made up the neighborhood in suburban Illinois in which I lived at the time. \n\nThe parents had come over from the old country seeking a better life in what was widely touted as a \"land of opportunity,\" but the kids had just watched translations of _Menace II Society_ and _Boyz in the Hood_ in order to help prepare them for what America would be like.\n\n\"Come on, G, just get out of the way, please. I just want a Slurpee.\"\n\nSometimes, when I am very polite in conflict, my effort to maintain civil discourse is misread as weakness or fear. I could tell I was not projecting what I meant to.\n\n\"Go around,\" he demanded.\n\n\"Or what?\"\n\n\"Go around, or you have to fight us.\"\n\nAt this point, I noticed that the other boys, about a half dozen in total, had circled around behind me. Shit was about to get real, and there was little I could do to stop it.\n\n\"I really don't want to. I mean, you know me. We're friends.\"\n\n\"_We aw fwends_,\" he answered and mimed rubbing tears from his eyes. The other boys laughed. \n\nWell, in hindsight, I suppose I could have turned around and circled Court 2, but I felt this would have set a bad precedent. If I went around that day, I would have had to go around every day, and there would be no convincing them that they didn't make me. There was nothing for it but to do _exactly as I was told_.\n\nI turned as fast as I could, grabbed the nearest kid, and pulled him bodily off his bike. \n\nMy thought was that I would get the worst of it, it being a six on one fight, but I silently vowed that at least one kid besides me was going to have his work cut out explaining the bruises at the dinner table.\n\nI wrapped my left arm around his head, anchoring my fingers against his nose, and pulled as hard as I could, offering me unrestricted access to his cheek, which I then started pummeling with my right fist. \n\nFortunately, 12-year-old kids are basically made of rubber, and one can't permanently hurt another one without more effort than most other 12-year-old kids can even muster with their little Nerf fists. \n\nThe kid I caught, L, started crying loudly, and I realized that I didn't have it in me to hit a crying kid again. I also realized that his buddies didn't rush me, per our clearly defined arrangement. \n\nI had held up my end of the deal, but G and the rest had left poor L to take the beating they had literally demanded from me. The courtyard was empty save the two of us.\n\nI stopped hitting L mid swing. I picked him up, dusted him off, and asked him if he wanted to get Slurpees with me. We hung out for the rest of the day, and I showed him how to make the flint from a lighter explode, which we both thought was the coolest thing we had yet seen in our young lives. \n\nThe next week, I saw G hanging out in Court 7 with some of the neighbor boys from my court. I slung open the sliding glass door to the patio and shouted, \"What are you doing on my turf, G!?\" \n\nHe didn't say a word as he got on his bike and pedaled like his face depended on it, while the Court 7 boys laughed their asses off, having already heard all about G's last attempt at being hard.  \n\nTL;DR: Neighborhood kids gang up on me, demanding that I fight them. I grudgingly comply. ",

        "text": "First time posting on this sub, I’m on mobile, so I guess formatting is an issue? \n\nI work in a supermarket where 9 hour shifts are standard for full time employees and we get 90 minutes of break a day, normally split into an hour lunch break and another half hour. \n\nWe have 3 bakers in store that have never taken their breaks, but leave 90 minutes early. It suits them as they get to leave early and ensures that all of the bakery products are baked and on the shelf as early as possible. \n\nA new store manager recently started and decided he doesn’t like how the bakery was running. He told the bakers that they need to have their breaks and clock out at the correct time. \n\nSo they agreed and instead of just clocking out 90 minutes early, they’d leave the store and go to the pub for 90 minutes, have a couple drinks then come back and clock out at the correct time.\n\nStill, the store manager isn’t happy. Forced the bakery manager to threaten them with disciplinary action if they continue, so starting from today, the bakers have decided to take their breaks at the most inconvenient times so the products take longer to hit the shelves.\n\nWhen I got to work today, I saw the store manager stood in front of the bakery asking why all the products aren’t on the shelf, one of the bakers replied to him (with the biggest shit eating grin I’ve ever seen) ‘sorry boss, we have to take our breaks like everyone else now, so we’re not gonna be ready as early’ he gave me a wink and walked into the warehouse as he chuckled to himself, leaving the store manager stood in front of a half empty bakery now furious at the situation he’s got himself into!\n\n",

It was her understanding that a thing is not like itself, since it IS itself and by her definition \"X is like Y\" requires X is not exactly Y.\n\nA few days after that, I discovered a Band (Krokus) that I really got into. Since it reminded my much of AC/DC who I also really like (I love Hardrock in general), I heard Krokus all the time. At one point my girlfriend got a little annoyed by the constant Hardrock and asked if we could stop listening to this AC/DC-like music.\n\nI got up, very emphatically changed the music to AC/DC and sat down with a devilish grin.\nShe nodded, admitted her mistake in choice of words and we changed genre after a few songs.\n\nTL;DR: Girlfriend defines \"X is like Y\" only if \"X != Y\" and asks me to change to music other than AC/DC-like artists.",

        "text": "I work at decently sized software company doing customer management. Most of the job is helping clients, but there is some selling. Until a year ago I could up\\-sell the software subscriptions, training class, and professional services.   \n\n\nA new VP came in and decided that selling training and professional services was too \"nickle and dime\" for the team, and it was given to one rep that really acted as an order\\-taker. We were told very clearly, \"Do not sell training or services. Let someone else handle those things.\" Sure thing, boss!  \n\n\nAt first the arrangement was fine, even thought depressing watching the order taker quickly make good commissions off the $1,200 training classes and $10,000 service engagements. All account reps would just CC them on emails saying New Rep will handle it. But then New Rep got overwhelmed by the demand and started dropping the ball. He would confirm registration, but not actually put someone in a class. Or they would forget to log a service engagement into the project queue, and then the customer would be waiting 8 weeks for the project to start when they were promised a \"next week\" kick\\-off.   \n\n\nAll these screw\\-ups led to angry customers, and they called the account managers first, so our lives got more difficult.   \n\n\nOnce this happened I reached out to one of our integration/service partners. They had a whole training team as well as services bench. I started sending all training and services to them. If I wasn't getting the sale, I really didn't care as long as the customer was happy. \n\nThe partner was a total pro. They ended up delivering better training and would really work with the client on a number of projects. They're sales started growing and growing, and customers were super happy. The word spread through the customer management team, and they all started doing the same\n\nThen I started to receive Visa gift cards in the mail. $100 here, $200 there. Soon I was being invited to industry conferences by the partner, and they would fly my wife out with me. Beautiful resorts where the partner would take us out to dinner and excursions. Turns out I we were generating a ton of new revenue for them, and they wanted to say thanks. \n\nIt's now been a year since we were told to stop selling training and services, and now management is freaking out about how there has been such a drop\\-off in service revenue. Consultants are being brought in, and there will be strategic evaluations over the next quarter. \n\nThis will be a fun exercise to explain why we are no longer selling these things. ",

        "text": "This is a story from long ago when I was working in a law office while attending grad school. The attorney I worked for had a reputation for being difficult to work with, but we got along great. I did have a problem with the office manager. She didn't care for me because I got a day off a week to attend my grad school classes and generally treated the place like a college job rather than the \"career\" she'd made out of it.\n\nPart of the deal that got me a day off a week for classes was I came in an hour earlier than the rest of the legal assistants. Office Manager didn't care for that, and took it out on me by doing things like lecturing me for being a minute late in the morning or a minute over on lunch when everyone else on support staff would roll in whenever and take long lunches to their heart's content.\n\nEnough background. Now the story:\n\nOne morning I get in and discover that all of the documents I need from the shared drive to get to work are gone. Even worse, about half the folders from the firm's shared drive are gone. I figured I could go to Office Manager and let her know what the problem is, but no one in that office was technically savvy so I figured I'd take a shot in the dark.\n\nThe solution was really easy. I went to the top level of the shared server and did a search for a client name. Sure enough their folder popped up, and from there it was easy enough to figure out that some technically non\\-savvy Legal Assistant (which was all of them) had moved half of the top level attorney folders into another attorney's folder.\n\nA quick cut and paste and everything was back to normal before anyone arrived. I figured I should tell someone what happened so it didn't happen again, so I went down to Office Manager's office. I explained what'd happened and the fix, and that she might want to tell people to be a little more careful about dragging folders around.\n\nShe looked up at me and her lips made an expression that was a dead ringer for my cat's asshole going on display when he's getting the good scratches on his back end.\n\n\"We're not paying you to do IT work. How much time did you waste that you could be working on important things? Get back to work.\"\n\nOkay. Whatever. I wouldn't have been able to do any work with all of my work missing, but I wasn't poking that bear. Like I said, it was just a college job and I knew I was out of there when I finished grad school while she was a lifer. So I went back to my desk and got back to work.\n\nFast forward a couple of weeks. I come in an hour before everyone and find the same problem. I do a quick search and discover that some technical genius has once again moved top level attorney folders into another attorney's folder which meant half the office's documents were missing. Sort of a big deal for a law office that lives and dies by the Wordperfect file.\n\nSo I grabbed some filing I needed to get done and spent the next hour or so working on that instead. Attorneys and legal assistants started to filter in. There was a fifty/fifty chance they'd be able to get straight to work or they'd find all their work gone. A quiet sense of panic came over the office that soon got less than quiet.\n\nThe third party IT people the firm contracted were called in at emergency rates because it wasn't their typical once a week visit. They're running a check of all the hardware and with Office Manager hovering over them raising hell about all the money they were losing blah, blah, blah.\n\nNow I despised Office Manager, but I liked the contract IT guys. So as I was passing by I whispered to one of them that they might want to check such and such folder. Within five minutes the situation was resolved when they realized the ridiculous situation that brought them out there.\n\nA little later Office Manager stopped by my desk and started laying into me for not telling her. This brought my attorney out to see what was going on. She explained that I knew what the issue was and didn't say anything.\n\nI shrugged and told my attorney that the last time I fixed this issue she'd reprimanded me and told me not to do IT work. I was simply following her instructions.\n\nShe turned a couple of different shades of purple. My attorney, who was my ultimate boss and liked me, got a good laugh out of that and told her maybe she should listen to me next time. That was the last of that because she ruled the Legal Assistants with an iron fist, but she couldn't say boo to someone if they had a partner backing them up.\n\nI left shortly after to \"focus on my school.\" Whenever I'm in town I make sure to stop by to have lunch with my attorney, and I always swing by her office all smiles and talking about how wonderful it is being my own boss and not having to worry about the bureaucratic BS that takes up so much of her time.",

        "text": "So, I'm a security guard. It's an okay job that underpays and has shitty management. They regularly do things like ignore my (approved) requests for days off and making me fight them over scheduling because I can't work when I have class. They also make me waste gas every 2 weeks to go across town just to submit my time sheets and pick up my checks because the owner doesn't trust emails and thinks direct deposit is a scam. Small things, but they add up. \n\nSo, minor story 1: My main site was closed for a week, so instead of letting me have some time off, my boss graciously let me make up all the hours I didn't want. They stuck me at a fancy hotel from 5 am to 10 am. The only instruction: \"go let the front desk know you're there, and ask them for directions\". Now, I'm friends with the guy that usually works that site and what I'm *supposed* to do is direct traffic in the parking garage and ensure that only guests park there. I go to the desk lady, and she snips at me that I should know my job and that my company already gave me instructions. \"Go to the front desk and ask them for directions\", I believe they were. Looks like I was done for the day, so I took a nap in my car (on site, of course) and went home at 10. This went on for the week. Best part: a new guy was starting at the end of the week, and I was asked to train him. That's when I finally recieved the instructions for the site. \n\nMinor story 2: My main site is the reason I didn't quite after the first month. It's a steady schedule, it's indoors with AC the blistering summer, and I get to sit at a desk all day and just make a round every half hour. I loved this site. I basically just watched movies and browsed Reddit moat of the day, but I'd also be doing all the little tasks that nobody wants to do. The little tasks weren't my job, but I did them because I liked the people around me and because I was pretty bored. Eventually, some big wig at the site didn't like that I was sitting, after all, security guys shouldn't be sitting down. I get told that I am no longer to be seen at my window nor sitting down. So, these days I grab a key to an abandoned office at 8 am, go inside, lay down some couch cushions on the floor, and lie down and do nothing all day. Sometimes I get called to unlock a door, but otherwise nothing. Best part: Everyone is happy because I'm not sitting around all day and assumes I'm patrolling. It's almost worth hiring that extra person to handle all the little tasks I was doing that weren't my job to begin with. \n\nSorry if the exposition to payoff ratio here isn't all that great, but this is the most malicious compliance I can muster in a job with no real responsibilities. Also I'm bored because I'm currently in said abandoned office and finished rewatching Bojack for the hundredth time. ",

        "text": "Apologies for length. \n\nI used to work at a call center that performed level one support for a bunch of companies that wanted to outsource it. Today, our story will focus in on Jackwagon, a tier two tech for our client Big Customer (BC) that doesn't want to do his job. \n\nBefore I begin the story, let me give context about the kind of guy Jackwagon is. He rarely responded to escalated issues until two to three days after we send them up. We know this isn't because he was busy because the rest of the tier two team wasn't busy. He never read our documentation and frequently routed tickets back to us asking us to do things we'd already done. He'd also rout them back to us with instructions on how to move forward with more complex procedures, also known as \"do his job for him.\" It was bad enough to the point where I had started an Excel spreadsheet with the ticket number, name, date, reason for escalation, Jackwagon's reason for routing it back, and why it shouldn't have been routed back. This is important later. \n\nThe incident itself happened on a Saturday, when I unfortunately wasn't in. A satellite site of BC called in reporting a system wasn't working. This was a priority one system that had to have any issues resolved immediately. Unfortunately, it was also so buttoned up that we weren't able to access it as tier one, so it always got escalated. As soon as we get the call, one of the agents sends the escalation email and, per the on call procedures for after hours issues, called Jackwagon. Jackwagon didn't answer. The procedures state that we have to call him every fifteen minutes and leave a voicemail every time, so that's what was done. Then, an email is received from Jackwagon: \"Stop calling me, I'm busy.\" \n\nSo we did. \n\nThe next part happened on Sunday, when I was in the office. Jackwagon calls, furious that we hadn't done out job and the system was still down. I tell him we can't touch that system because we don't have access. I point out that, according to our documentation, we'd called him to the tune of six times. He huffed and hung up. \n\nThen the BC IT director called. He wanted to know what happened. I gave him a dutiful report and he stated he would like to speak to my manager. I informed him management was not in on Sundays, but I could make a phone call and see if we could get them to call him. He said that wouldn't be necessary hung up. \n\nOn Monday, I came in to an email from my manager asking for the spreadsheet I had been keeping and for me to come and see him, along with the rest of the crew working with BC. I sent it to him and we showed up for debriefing. \n\nThe manager has successfully proven via documentation on our ticketing system and theirs that we had followed all given procedures. Blame was dropped squarely on Jackwagon, whose lack of action had lost the company TWO MILLION DOLLARS. Turns out, that satellite site was demoing BCs services to a client and that they were negotiating these services for all of their locations, but after the issue failed to be resolved in a timely manner and caused significant loss of income, they weren't interested in moving forward with the contract. My manager, who knew of my pure hatred for Jackwagon (I was the head agent on that account, so I dealt with him the most) and of my vendetta against him, casually mentioned that Jackwagon had been screwing up a lot lately, hadn't he? The director hadn't heard anything about that, so my manager mentioned my spreadsheet to him. \n\nI came in the following Monday to find my manager waiting by my desk, grinning ear to ear. The news had just come down that Jackwagon was fired. I was so happy that I bought pizza for the entire BC team. \n\nTL;DR, on call tells us to stop bothering him, so we do, causing the company to lose $2 million and him to lose his job. ",

        "text": "So a very simple one...my organisation (public sector) hit us with an edict that required us to suddenly start paying back the costs of any personal phone calls made by mobile. We had to make all payments to our local head office. I was based in a field office and never needed to be at HQ.\n\nWe were to start getting itemised bills. Typically they were printed hard copy.\n\nBecause they had a corporate deal calls were cheap and generally fixed rate -about 8c per minute so this wasn't too painful.\n\nCue compliance - Every month I would sit down with my phone bill and go through each call. (I was busy, there were normally hundreds of calls). I'd separate out my calls ( generally an odd amount but low  around the €8 mark). This generally took about an hour (I was being paid about €35.00 per hour then but was required to do this).\n\nI didn't have a cheque book and HQ didn't have a credit card machine, so I would hop into my car drive to the HQ, wait while they processed my payment and return to my office(all told another hour).\n\nI'd then sit down and process a mileage claim to HQ for my trip at .67 per km for the 16 km round trip receiving €10.72 for my troubles. \n\nEdit...Removed a decimal.\n\nEDIT TL;DR - Get paid €70 to pay employer €8 and claim back €11  (with thanks to u/TheAquaro)",

We had a member who was either awesome or terrible depending on a collection of factors. We'll call him Greg.\n\nOn this day, Greg showed up awesome. He came into the employee area and greeted everyone. \n\n&gt;Greg: Hey. I think I left my cigar box in my cart yesterday. While I'm out on this round can you go grab it for when I get back?\n\n&gt; Me: Sure thing.\n\n&gt;Greg: No need to bring it out, I can survive 18 holes without a cigar.\n\nI check the logs to see which cart he was in, and when I find that cart in the holding area, the cigar box isn't there. I figure he just left it elsewhere, so I forget about it and get back to work. When he comes back he asks for his cigars and I tell him that they weren't in his cart.\n\nHe.Blows.Up.\n\nStarts accusing us of stealing them, screaming at people that weren't even working yesterday. He finally says, \"You find them, and you bring them to me immediately.\" My boss is standing near by and tries to calm him down but he storms off. The boss looks at me and says, \"Call whoever was working yesterday and try to figure this out.\"\n\nI begin calling everyone that worked the day before, and the only person that I couldn't get a hold of is the person that cleaned the carts. About half an hour later he calls me back. I ask him if he saw the cigars and what he did with them. His response.\n\n&gt; Yeah, I put them in his golf bag\n\n.....So I walk over to his golf bag, and sure enough they're in the largest pocket of the bag. I take them to my boss's office, and although he's in a meeting with one of the other members he asks where I found them. When he hears the answer he says to the members, \"Excuse me, I have some business to take care of.\"\n\nMy boss and I walk over to the clubhouse and start asking around for Greg. Naturally, he's at the bar, and naturally, he's spouting about his stolen cigars. As we approach the table he quiets down a bit and says, quite smugly, \n\n&gt; Have you found my cigars yet?\n\nTo which my boss responds by tossing the cigar box to him and announces, quite loudly,\n\n&gt; Yes Greg. We found your cigars. They were hidden so carefully in your own golf bag. Now if you would please apologize to my 16 year old employee who solved the missing case of your stolen cigars, that would be wonderful.\n\nGreg muttered a half apology while everyone at the bar stared in our general direction, and I proudly walked out of the club house with my boss to finish the rest of my work day.",

This was a really big deal for us, usually we'd do more like 2 months. Products often change a lot right before a release so you've got your training all ready and then a bunch of important screens change so your work is wasted. This time I spent a bunch of long nights getting everything ready.\n\nThe class was made up of VIPs, people who are influential in our community and couple really help move the new product. Class took place in July or August and it was brutally hot, high 90s, high humidity. I wore my typical summer trainer uniform, corporate polo shirt, nice shorts, teva sandals. The class mostly dressed similar although about half wore t-shirts and there were a lot of flip-flops, these are technical people, they're used to manipulating hardware, they're casual in dress.\n\nSecond day of the two day class the VP of my division comes in to give these guys a rah-rah talk. I knew this was coming and didn't think much of it. My classroom is near the cafeteria, I get seen a lot and I've been in this position (at that time) for about 4 years.  \n\nThe VP looks at me and does a double take but doesn't say anything. I welcome him in and give him the floor. He does his talk and splits without a word to me.  \n\nThe next day the word comes down \"curtludwig cannot wear shorts and sandals.\" notice that its not that nobody can wear shorts and sandals, just me.  I asked my manager about it and he just kind of shrugged.\n\nSo from the next two years if I wore shorts I always wore shoes. Nobody said a word.\n\nThat was 8 years ago, the manager I worked for got laid off, the VP left to \"peruse other opportunities\" (fired) and I'm still here, now back to shorts and sandals for the summer.",

It was a basic shelf stocker job at a local drugstore chain, and the reason why I will now take anything else over working that job again.\nI worked there for two months, 4-5 hours depending on how much there was to do twice a week. My team was separate from the actual store employees since we were contracted through a different company, so we only ever stocked shelves and nothing else. We weren't even allowed to help out customers.\n\nDespite being a relatively small store I had three bosses, the personnel manager who was rarely ever present since she also managed a few other stores in the region and the two team leaders. I got along with everyone well enough, except for one of the team leaders, a woman in her 50s. From day 1 she couldn't stand me, to the point where when the other team leader took vacation she didn't call me in for three weeks, meaning I effectively earned nothing for almost half the time I was contracted there.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe working conditions were also bs, you were constantly rushed no matter how fast you actually worked, it was never enough. Since we only worked for such a short time per day we also weren't allowed to take breaks, if you wanted to even drink something you had to take whatever you brought yourself with you everywhere, despite personnel rooms being available in the same building.\n\nMy job consisted mainly of taking one of the big \"trolleys\" with wares and stocking the shelves, after all of those were done there were also separate boxes with mostly smaller wares. Now, old team leader lady took great joy in always being on my tail, if I made the tiniest of mistakes she would not hesitate to spend 10 minutes of both our _oh so precious_ time to lecture me. So when she told me on my last day that \"_Your job is ONLY to do the trolleys_, NOT to help the customers that is the STORE EMPLOYEES' job\" (I gave a woman directions to the aisle she was looking for), I happily obliged.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTwo hours later the trolleys were done, the team moved onto the boxes (which took about half the time of the trolleys), and I went home because she told me only the trolleys were my job.\n\nFive minutes later I get a text from the personnel manager, asking where the hell I am. I explain what happened and that it was my last day anyway, that old team leader woman made my days there hell but the rest of the team were great to work with.\n\nThe company ended up paying the entire team an additional hour because they couldn't finish the boxes fast enough instead of paying me alone my regular one to two hours of doing boxes, because grumpy old boss lady told me to only do one thing.",

We got called by our scoutleader and we arrived 1 hour late. \n\nWhen we arrive at the meeting, we apologised for being late and explained what happened, an honest mistake. Nevertheless we get a loud scorning in front of all the members in our group which was very humiliating. \nTo top it off they gave us a ‘task punishment’. \n\nHere is where the fun starts...\n\nThey had us take a camp box from the attic of our building (keep in mind this thing is HEAVY even for 2 people to carry and take down) and WASH the contents (even though they were cleaned 3 months ago). \n\nSo we did exactly what they asked us, we WASHED the contents but they did not say anything about drying the contents. \nBasicly we put all the items wet in the box, closed it up and put it back on the attic. \n\nThe not-drying caused the items to accumulate mold after months, rendering them useless to use in summer camp. \n\nNOTE: I realise this was an asshole move on my part, but I was fifteen and the shame of unrightfully being scolded at, in front of the whole group made us act out.

They do their sets, they volunteer for extra stuff, because none of the other DJs really want to get up at 6 am on a Saturday to make sure the \"special events\" their sponsors are throwing are covered.  They busts their butt for over 7 months.  Then suddenly, this happened:\n\nThey loaned some of their (virtual) equipment for an event to the event lead and left the event on Friday.  As per previous events, they tell management and the rest of the staff that the items are there, and everything is silent in the group chat for the better part of a day.  Yes, normal chatter happens, then all of the sudden, the person running the event goes ballistic, accusing the hobby DJ of being \"passive aggressive\" and of saying rude words and more.\n\nNote: those words were NEVER said by the DJ in question.  Nor can proof be submitted that the DJ did say those words.  Edited messages in group chat have \"edited\" or \"deleted\" when they are edited or deleted.\n\nThe event lead continues to go ballistic, abuses the hobby DJ and more, and eventually, the admin steps in and \"deals with it.\"  Hobby Dj apologizes for the entire thing, and waits for _hours_ for their stuff to be returned. (remember - this is all virtual items, but it still costs real world money)\n\nThe next day, hobby DJ finds out they're on probation.  What for?  For what happened the day before - even though there was NO proof they said anything bad to or about the event lead.  Accusations of \"bad attitude\" and \"inappropriate comments\" are made towards them.  Hobby DJ asks for proof. None given.  Hobby DJ counters with telling the admin what they have been doing for the 7 months they've been on the air with them\n\nHobby DJ has been recording their sets and the archive is kept by someone else for their safety - that way, the hobby DJ can't delete or edit the files themselves.  The hobby DJ has also been keeping the general chat logs whenever they are on the air for the same length of time, and can retrieve months of archived sets chat logs if need be.\n\nHobby DJ offers up all these files.  Admin refuses to answer them.  Hobby DJ has decided: \"If I'm on probation, I'm only doing the sets I'm scheduled to do.  They are going to have to find another volunteer for the 'special events' they've planned.\"\n\nHobby DJ has already been offered extra sets by two of their coworkers while one of the other Hobby DJs goes on vacation and the other has to deal with their family.  Hobby DJ has said no.  Simply put, Hobby DJ has something else going on during the set that was offered.  Hobby DJ is now lying in wait for the next yell of \"not being a team player.\"  Hobby DJ has decided that if they're on probation, they shouldn't be representing the radio station, so no more volunteering for extra shifts or any extra help until probation has been rescinded.\n\nLet's see how long probation lasts.",

This story involves one of her nephew called Brian.\n\nAt this point of her life, she is just out of college into the first couple of months into her entry job. She's saving up for her own place so money is tight. Her sister's family is not too well off either so an ice cream is a treat all around.\n\nSo she has been doing well at work, so on the way back from work she bought a tub of ice cream to treat herself. She meant to share it with the rest of the family as dessert after dinner, maybe whip it up into a banana split or something while sharing the good news at the dinner table. \n\nShe carefully checks the kids were busy playing in their room before sneaking in to hide the ice cream behind the fridge. But it's like kids were force sensitive padawans and felt a disturbance in the force they managed to sense the ice cream entering the house behind the closed doors of their rooms and immediately dropped what they were doing and ran to the front of the house. \n\nLuckily mom ran interference and stopped the kids in their tracks. Mom said that the ice cream is Lisa's ice cream and only Lisa can take it out of the fridge. And so the ice cream was safe. Or so Lisa and mom thought. \n\nI'm guessing anyone who ever had to watch toddlers and kids before knows the ending by now. Lo and behold what did Lisa finds as she comes out of the bath but Brian's cute butt sticking out of the fridge with a chair under him and half of the tub in his mouth. And all over his face, in his hair and some how in ears as well. \n\nLisa's shriek immediately called mom into the kitchen and some spanks were had that day. \n\nBrian, now a 32 years old father of two demons himself still maintains his innocence. \n\nEdit: to clarify the compliance is that Brian didn't take the ice cream out the fridge. As for the ice cream on his face and in his tummy, that's on mommy when she took Brian out of the fridge. ",

        "text": "I once had the shittiest landlord (here on out named SL). Our first warning came when all three ladies in the local consumer dispute council flinched badly when they heard his name. Hubby n'me were there to get a standard rental contract because SL's home made version looked somewhat dodgy when it came to how the deposit should be handled. The ladies all agreed that we had a legal right to use the standard contract and strongly insisted we should avoid signing any other version. They aren't allowed to say anything about other peoples' disputes there, but there were A LOT of meaningful looks getting thrown around. Both hubby and I noticed and agreed that we had to be cautious onwards.\n\nWe moved in anyway: we were both going to uni and needed roof over our heads. Still, we immediately started looking into other options. Which turned out to be a wise move: during the six months we rented there he abused our friend verbally and horribly because he had parked his old car in a public parking spot not too far from the house. The car was old and cheap, but clean and otherwise perfectly normal. He asked us repeatedly to move our trash cans to new sides of the house, which we did. It wasn't hard, but it was annoying that he couldn't decide where he wanted them. He tried to sell our sports equipment (skis and bikes), which he had offered to store in his shed when we first negotiated terms. And I could go on and on, there were something every single day: hundreds of off-putting and petty issues that obviously meant the world to him as he always yelled his orders, looking like imminent heart attack personified.\n\nHubby and I agreed to SL's many whims: we just wanted to make as little fuss as possible and get the hell out of Dodge. The single dad to two toddlers renting the apartment next to us moved in after us and out before us; I didn't know exactly what transpired, but Mr. SL wasn't any kinder to kids. Happily, our best other housing option finally came through and we were of course super relived. But before we managed to give our notice we got the single moment that made up for six months of treading on egg shells. \n\nIt was late autumn and the first snow had started falling as we drove home one evening. The next morning, as we were still putting the kettle on, violent knocking was heard at the door. Outside stood SL, absolutely livid and yelling that we either had to brush away the snow before parking or park at the public parking spot, because he now had visible tracks in his driveway. He was right too, you could see the melted tracks there. But, as we had a new (and fantastic) housing contract signed and in our pocket, we for once didn't give one single damn.\n\nI: \"So?\"\n\nSL: \"You can't drive on the snow!\"\n\nI: \"...\"\n\nI was just looking at him, as his face rapidly went through every color in the red spectrum: which was both worrying and somewhat disturbing. While I pondered his survival chances, he made his near-fatal mistake, as he yelled, top of his lungs:\n\nSL: \"DO YOU THINK I'M STUPID?\"\n\nI: \"... Yes, I do think that.\" \n\nI have never been so calm and confident in my life as in that exact moment. I seriously thought he was going to keel over and die then, right there on our doorstep, but his apoplexy hindered him from any more yelling: there was just steam coming out at that point, so we closed the door on him. After a few minutes he managed to stagger away and returned not much later with a termination letter, which we accepted with glee and broad smiles as we informed him that we would only need about half the notice period. \n\nSince we had insisted on the standard contract we also got our deposit back intact: he couldn't point out one new single thing out of order when we moved. We had documented everything with pictures as we moved in and had the local consumer dispute council firmly at our backs.",

Office gives you the ability to upload a profile picture which people would see when they open an email that you're on.  If someone doesn't have a picture uploaded, it just shows a general silhouette (this is important later).  A few people had uploaded pictures, but most never bothered.\n\nThen one day an email goes out to the entire company that the top executives liked the profile picture feature and were highly encouraging everyone in the company to upload a picture of themselves.  To me, \"highly encourage\" meant optional, so I chose not to upload a picture and forgot about it.\n\nAbout a week later, I was meeting with my manager in his office and he mentioned to me that the head of our division told him I did not have a profile picture, and asked him to ask me if I would upload one.  My manager's a nice guy and so is the head of the division, so even though it wasn't required (which I confirmed was actually the case), I had no problem doing it.\n\nSince my manager and I do have a good relationship, I casually asked him how the division head even knew I didn't have a profile picture, since I figured he had better things to do then check the profiles of the dozens of people that are in our division.  Apparently one of the higher ups in the company was able to generate a report with a list of names of people who didn't upload a picture.  The names got sent out to each person's respective division head and then to their respective manager.  Even though it wasn't required, there was apparently some company goal to get the number of employees with profile pictures as high as possible.  My manager didn't personally care if I uploaded a picture, and I don't think head of our division did either, but to avoid having to deal with the higher ups about this, my manager asked if I could just upload a picture.  I told him I would take care of it and asked him, just to confirm, that once i uploaded a picture to my profile, my name would be removed from the list.  He said that was his understanding.  I smiled and said I would do it right now.  I think he knew I was up to something.\n\nI went back to my desk and took a screenshot of the silhouette that the profile picture defaults to when you don't upload one.  Then I uploaded that screenshot as my profile picture.\n\nAbout a week after that my manager thanks me for uploading a picture.  Apparently the report had been rerun and I was no longer on it.  He didn't say anything, but I'm pretty sure he knew what I had done since we're on emails together all the time.  I doubt anybody that actually cares about this will ever realize what I did, but if they do, I'll be ready for that.",

Did I mention this is where the meeting was held two days prior? I follow her upstairs as she demands that I evict and fine the other tenants as they aren’t sticking to the agreed rules. \n\nThe cause of this outrage her flatmate ‘john’ has left his morning tea mug and plate out on the draining to dry as he was in a rush. I tried my best to reason with ‘Debbie’ and pointed out at least he had made some effort to clean up after himself. Of course this wasn’t enough she wanted him out. \n\nI agreed to pass it on to my manager who by this point had had enough. \n\nSo we decided to do the first inspection that day and wrote up charges for every infraction in the kitchen. Sellotaped cleaning rota on wall - charge as it may damage the paint. Floor not freshly cleaned - charge as we will now have to pay for it to be cleaned as this can be a ‘health and safety issue’. Rubbish in rubbish bin - charge. \n\nYou get my point every single infraction was charged/ fined the maximum allowance and these charges were to be split each of the flat members regardless of fault. For some reason only one person received the letter regarding the charges due to a system error. \n\nDebbie was down at reception the next day arguing that monthly kitchen inspections are an ‘invasion of her privacy’ and that we should treat our residents like adults instead of treating the accommodation like it was a ‘police state’. My manager and I agreed to back down and wipe the charges this once as a courtesy. \n\nIt’s now been nearly 6 weeks and I have only seen her in passing since.",

        "text": "TLDR: This is very long, but a really great narrator on youtube read it and even did voices for all the characters! It's  very much worth a listen if you don't feel like reading this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9vyXG--0cY&amp;t=17m48s\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a tale of how I came to be the thorn in the side of a very rich man, and was thus given the title, of Boat Nazi. About six years ago, when I still lived in a prominent east coast city, I was hired on to be the night shift attendant at a marina located by a restaurant district and an arena that held concerts during the summer. I was not part of the group that ran the parking garage or parking lots and my bosses were contracted by the owner of the entire area, solely to to maintain the marina and nothing else. This involved, among other things, charging by the hour for unleased spaces and keeping boats out of reserved spaces that had been leased to one particular boat owner for the summer season. Now, I could tell all kinds of tales about the people who worked the day shift, and the people who worked parking, but this tale is going to focus on a person we shall call Willy, and how I drove him near to madness by simply doing my job...\n\n\n\nDuring the week, no one worked at the marina, so spaces were free and no one was around to keep lease holder spaces from being occupied by others. One Sunday evening, just as the sun was setting, a woman came onto the marina looking very distraught. She said that her family was taking their large boat up the coast from Florida and that they wanted to find a marina to stay at, but had been unable to reach the office to see f their were any more spaces to rent. She told me the boat was very VERY large, and would not fit into the marina proper. I told her that the boat could dock on the side of the marina during the week, but by Friday they needed to have either secured a paid space here, or somewhere else since the only place their boat could fit was leased to a water taxi that only worked on weekends. She thanked me and scurried away.\n\n\n\nLittle did I know the insanity that was about to follow...\n\n\n\nSo, Friday afternoon rolls around, and I show up for my evening shift to see a MONSTROUSLY HUGE boat parked in the water taxi spot. I have yet to see a bigger, noncommercial boat to this day! It was easily three levels with a water slide attached at the top and more space to sunbathe than the entire surface area of the marina put together. It was half blocking both of the throughway's around it and it was not sized to be in a marina this size At All! The person I was relieving told me they just got them to move it enough for the other boats to squeak by, but that had taken hours and they were my problem now. \n\n\n\nAwesome...\n\n\n\nI look through the paperwork and realize my coworkers hadn't charged them for the night, no problem, I needed to figure out when they were leaving anyway. So, I will out the paperwork, Timestamp the card, and make my way towards the boat, and towards loud music and louder screaming. As I neared I could tell the person screaming was upset they had to move their boat so other boats could use the throughway, and that they were insulted that the water taxi guy had told them to move a few hours earlier. I knew immediately I was going to be in for a bad time with this one. The only course of action was to be as polite, but professional as possible, and hope things went well.\n\n\n\nAs I stood on the dock, paperwork in hand, the woman from earlier, whom I now realize is Willies girlfriend, notices me and says, \"That's the one I talked to the other day! They told me we could stay here.\"\n\n\n\nMe: Miss, I told you that you could dock here during the week for free while you got in contact with the marina owner in order to set up payment or find another location. If I had known your boat was large enough to block the exit and entrance of other boats I would not have suggested it, as it is clear that this has become a problem.\n\n\n\nAt this point, Willy appears. He is well over six feet, more than likely 400 pounds, and very VERY drunk.\n\n\n\nWilly: So, what are you going to do to fix it, HUH?! I got people here, asking me to move, when you said it was fine! This is your screw up!\n\n\n\nMe: Sir, as I have already explained to your friend, if I had known the full size of your boat I never would have suggested it, since I would have known these problems would arise. Furthermore, you are in a space that has already been leased for the season to the water taxi, and you need to make better arrangements as soon as possible, since he works during the weekend and needs this spot. Now, I am going to need you to sign and pay for tonight, since it is the weekend and we charge to stay on weekends.\n\n\n\nAt this point, Willy has gotten up from his chair on the sun deck of the boat and started towards disembarking with a lot of grumbling. Upon reaching the dock he takes the papers from me and starts looking them over, though it is clear he is not processing anything from the glazed look in his eyes.\n\n\n\nWilly: So, what, you're charging me?\n\n\n\nMe: Yes Sir, anything longer than five hours is $25, which covers you until dawn the next day.\n\n\n\nWilly pulls out a wallet and hands me $100 in $20 bills.\n\n\n\nWilly: Keep the change, sweetie!\n\n\n\nI don't like bullies, I don't like favoritism, and I don't like rich people using their money to force other people out of their way. This guy had just ticked off enough boxes to officially activate robotic customer service mode. \n\n\n\nME: Sir, the amount is $25. Do you need me to get you change from my cash drawer? \n\n\n\nAt this point I have $40 in one hand and the rest in the other, handing it back to him.\n\n\n\nWilly: No, see you take that and then we don't play this song and dance with the taxi guy, get me? *wink*\n\n\n\n\nMe: Sir, I am not depriving a paying customer their spot. The charge for the night is $25, and you need to find a new place to keep your boat come the morning. Do you need change from my drawer or do you have a smaller bill?\n\n\n\nWilly looks at the money, then at me, then back at the money. At first confused, then increasingly more angry. Before he could say anything further, his girlfriend appeared at his side.\n\n\n\nGirlfriend: How much was it again?\n\n\n\nMe: $25, please, and your signature on the time card.\n\n\n\nWe quickly exchange money, and she starts pulling him back to the boat while I go to deposit the money and time card in the lock box. There was a lot of shouting from their boat that night, but they were quiet when I left at 3am. The next day, I came in and the boat was still there, and once again they had left the collection of payment to me. \n\n\nWonderful...\n\n\n\nI gather my things and proceed to the dock next to their boat. Willy notices me and intercepts as I reach the boat. \n\n\n\nWilly: No one answered the phone in that office, so we are staying here until they do and there is nothing you can do about it!\n\n\n\nMe: The office is open Monday to Friday from 10am to 5pm. $25, Please.\n\n\n\nWilly: Wait, were doing this again?\n\n\n\nME: Every night you stay is another $25. $25, Please.\n\n\n\nWilly: Well, then take a $50 and don't bother me again!\n\n\n\nMe: I can't do that, Sir. This space belongs to someone and as such I cannot accept payment in advance. You have to sign the time card and pay $25 for every night you are in this spot over the weekend. $25, Please.\n\n\n\nWilly: WHY!?!\n\n\n\nMe: To keep a record of your time here so that the actual person leasing this space can be appropriately compensated for the inability to do so. $25, Please.\n\n\n\nWilly, who has been increasingly more angry as this exchange has gone on as now stepped forward and is well into my personal space. I do not back up, but instead retain the eye contact I have had throughout this exchange. \n\n\n\nWilly: Well, too good to take my money from yesterday and now you won't back down today HUH!?! Think you're pretty tough HUH?! Well I'll tell you what you are, You're a Fucking Boat Nazi!!!\n\n\n\nME: Sir, I have German heritage and take great offense to that term, I politely ask that you refrain from using it in my presence. $25, Please.\n\n\n\nWilly: Oh yeah!? Well, guess what, it's a free country! I can say whatever I want!\n\n\n\nMe: Sir, that is technically untrue. There are laws in place to prevent both hate speech and the instigation of an unsafe environment, such as calling fire in a movie theater when there is none. $25, Please.\n\n\n\nWilly: Oh yeah!?! Well, what if I go online and tell everyone that you're a Boat Nazi! What are you going to do about that HUH!?!\n\n\n\nNow, keep in mind this was before things like yelp were even thought of, which means this guy was going to go on random message boards and bitch at people about the mean little marina attendant making the poor defenseless rich guy actually have to pay for something. It took all I could not to laugh at him right then and there. Especially since by this point, he was starting to turn purple with rage. I also realized that this guy was trying to start a verbal altercation so that he could cry abuse and never have to deal with me again, maybe even be compensated for it. So I make my face as expressionless and my voice as emotionless as possible.\n\n\n\nMe: Sir, what you say on the Internet is your personal business. $25, Please. \n\n\n\nAt this point the girlfriend appeared again and shoved $25 in my hand and quickly signed the time card before grabbing Willy and trying to take him back to the boat. I turned and walked away to the sounds of him screaming after me that I was a Boat Nazi until she got him back inside.\n\n\n\nOn Sunday, I arrived and the boat was still there, and the ticket for the night was still left for me to take care of....Huzzah...\n\n\n\nI approach the boat, again, only this time Willy looks downright smug and doesn't move from the sun deck as I approach, making me crane my neck to speak to him.\n\n\n\nMe: $25, Please.\n\n\n\nWilly: I already paid.\n\n\n\nNow, I knew he didn't already pay for two reasons. One, there was no time card in the box for it. Two, the lock roll we keep in the box had not been opened nor was there any money in the lock box from payment. He wanted me to accuse him so he could complain on Monday and try and get me fired. his skills were weak however, next to my years of customer service training. \n\n\n\nMe: May I see your receipt, Sir?\n\n\n\nWilly faltered here, apparently he had always been too angry to notice that every time his girlfriend paid, she got a preprinted receipt I brought along. The girlfriend, was sitting across from him, shaking her head at the sight of watching a grown man lie to a teenager over $25 and some weird sense of pride, and failing at it. \n\nEdit: Typo and a bit of formatting. \n\n\n\nWilly: I didn't get one!\n\n\n\nMe: Then I must ask you to pay again and you will be refunded on Monday when you go to the office to talk about the water taxi lease and staying here. $25, Please.\n\n\n\nAt this point Willy knew he had been caught and with his girlfriend staring poison daggers at him, proceeded to disembark, sign the time card, collect his receipt, and pay me $25.\n\n\n\nI thought this would be the end of it, but oh no! About twenty minutes later he comes storming up to me in my tiny cubical on the marina and i go out to greet him. \n\n\n\nMe: Good evening Sir\n\n\n\nWilly: How much is it going to take!? HUH?!\n\n\n\nMe: Sir, you already paid for the night.\n\n\n\nWilly: NO! How much is it going to take to keep your Boat Nazi Ass out of My Business!!!\n\n\n\nMe: Sir, collecting $25 a night for every person who stays at this marina for more than five hours on the weekends is my job and business. \n\n\n\nWilly: No! NO, NO!! You tell me the number and I pay it and then you go away! That's how this works!!!!\n\n\n\nMe: Sir, I feel I haven't made myself clear. For that, I apologize. If you stay for more than five hours-\n\n\n\nWilly: NO! Are you stupid? Are you deaf!? I'm paying you off to leave me alone asshole! I can't keep getting into fucking fights with my woman every night because you have to come and spoil everything! What is it going to take for YOU to GO AWAY!!!!!\n\n\n\nAt this point he pulls a large wad of bills out of his wallet, and I take a step backwards so he is out of arms reach.\n\n\n\nMe: Sir, as I have already stated, you have paid for the night and can not pay in advance.\n\n\n\nWilly: You are NOT this STUPID! No One is this STUPID! You like this HUH!?! Making people get off their boats and sign your stupid tickets and ruining their nights! You're a Fucking Boat Nazi and EVERYONE is going to KNOW!!!!!!!\n\n\n\nME: Sir, my job entails keeping a record of-\n\n\n\nWilly: FUCK YOU!!!!\n\n\n\nAt this he stormed off the the boat, ranting about how I must be some kind of idiot to not be paid off. I left work that night, hoping they would be gone by Friday.\n\n\n\nFriday rolls around again, and as I walk on the dock I see Willy walking a couple of people in parking uniforms back from his boat, all of them laughing and smiling. Willy stops them in front of me and grins.\n\n\n\nWilly: I just took your bosses out to lunch and they said I don't have to pay per night anymore! \n\n\n\nParking dude one: You can just let him go, it's fine.\n\n\n\nMe: Sir, you're not my boss. I work for the marina.\n\n\n\nParking dude two: Oh yeah, they did say something about contracting that out to a different company this year. I guess you don't work for us! Isn't that funny!\n\n\n\nAt this, parking dude one and two start laughing and Willy is rapidly losing his smile as he realizes he just wined and dined the wrong people. \n\n\n\nParking guy one proceeds to explain that Willy had come in that morning to the parking office and had asked to speak to whoever was in charge. Apparently he had put it off all week and just walked up and went into parking instead of the Marina because he thought they were the same thing, for whatever reason. He had then proceeded to spend the rest of the day with the two people in charge of parking, taking them on his boat, paying for lunch, the whole shebang. Up until this year parking actually DID control the marina, but starting this season had they used a subcontractor instead, which is whom I worked for and was employed through. They had actually thought he was talking about a space in the lot until they saw me and my different uniform and then everything snapped into place for them.\n\n\n\nParking guy two: Can't you just give him a break? He's a really great guy!\n\n\n\nMe: The space he occupies is leased to the water taxi and he has been unable to use it for several weeks now and it is undoubtedly hurting his business in the process.\n\n\n\nParking guy one shrugs at Willy and parking guy two claps him on the shoulder.\n\n\n\nParking guy two: Sorry buddy, we tried. Best of luck though!\n\n\n\nAnd with that, they walked away.\n\n\n\nWilly's face started to contort and change colors at a rapid pace, so I took the opportunity to sidestep him and go into my tiny office. Once again, no one had made them pay for the night. I created the time card and receipt and walked out towards Willy as he started rapidly walking away yelling \"No\" louder and louder with each step, until he was back on his boat and screaming at his girlfriend about how he had just bribed the wrong people. She started freaking out that he couldn't tell the difference and as their argument raged I stood on the dock and silently waited for them to either notice me on their own or end the argument so I could make my presence known. \n\n\n\nGirlfriend noticed me as she stormed out and threw her hands in the air.\n\n\n\nGirlfriend: Are You Fucking Kidding me!? You were right there and you STILL didn't pay!?\n\n\n\nWilly: I shouldn't have to pay! It's all that fucking Boat Nazi's Fault!!!!\n\n\n\nGirlfriend: SHUT UP!!!! I'm done! I'm done with this, and you, and this God Damn BOAT!! \n\n\n\nGirlfriend proceeds to disembark and pay and sign the slip.\n\n\n\nWilly: What the hell do you think your doing?!\n\n\n\nGirlfriend: Being a GOD DAMNED ADULT!!\n\n\n\nWith that she stomped off, leaving Willy to scream after her about how she can't go and this and that while I made my way back to my office and the lock box.\n\n\n\nThe next day, when I came in the boat was still there, they still hadn't gotten payment for the day, and the boat appeared empty.\n\n\n\nThe water taxi guy showed up and asked if he could run people off the side of the dock since his space was occupied and he really needed to get to work. I told him that wouldn't be a problem and we actually had a lovely chat on and off all night about how awful Willy was between his customers. \n\n\n\nTowards the later end of the night Willy and Girlfriend walked onto the dock, reconciled it would seem. I walked up to them and presented the time card.\n\n\n\nMe: $25, Please.\n\n\n\nWilly: Make me!\n\n\n\nMe: Sir, you need to pay $25 for keeping your boat here today and you need to sign the time card.\n\n\n\nWilly: No! You can't make me! This is fucking unconstitutional and You. Can't. MAKE. MEEEEE!!!!\n\n\n\nGirlfriend: For FUCKS SAKE Willy! You told me you wouldn't DO this ANYMORE!!!!!\n\n\n\nWilly turns to Girlfriend: Babe, it's the PRINCIPLE of-\n\n\n\nGirlfriend: NO! I'm DONE! Forever Willy!!\n\n\n\nAt this she takes a ring off her finger and throws it at him before snatching the time card out of my hand, signing it, and shoving it and the money in my hand before running back where they had come from.Wily picked up the ring and started towards his boat, silent and defeated. I put the money in the bank box and continued to help the water taxi while Willy could be seen, drinking alone on his boat, long into the night.\n\n\n\nthe next day was the fourth of July, the biggest outdoor holiday of the country and being on a boat is THE place to be for it. By the time I came into work the whole marina was packed to the gills! With Willy's boat towering over them all, and surrounded by port authority. The water taxi guy waved me over and told me that Willy had invited all of his friends to an all day drink fest, but in an attempt to \"Stick it to that Boat Nazi\" had all of his friends tie themselves off of each other and ultimately to his huge boat to keep them from having to pay. This had resulted in no one being able to leave the marina and when he became belligerent with the other boat owners, they had called port authority who were currently demanding he untie the boats and make them go find actual parking. I went to the lock box and, you guessed it, no payment for Willy!\n\n\n\nI decided that now was the best time to collect since people of authority were present in case the very angry and drunk man decided he wanted a physical confrontation with me as much as he seemed to want it from them. No sooner did I approach the boat than Willy locked his glazed eyes on me.\n\n\n\nWilly: It was you wasn't it you fucking Boat Nazi!! First my girl and now my party! Fuck YOU!!!\n\n\n\nPort Authority officer one: SIR! You need to calm Down!\n\n\n\nPort Authority officer two: What's all this about Nazi's?\n\n\n\nMe: Hello officer. I work for the marina and this fellow took to calling me that because I come down here every day for payment with paperwork for him to sign.\n\n\n\nPort Authority officer one: Wait, he's calling you a Nazi for doing your job?\n\n\n\nPort Authority officer two: It sounds like someone has a problem with authority.\n\n\n\nWilly takes a huge step towards me and almost falls off the boat, causing Port Authority officers one and two to catch him and pull him back.\n\n\n\nPort Authority officer one: Whoa there Buddy, that's quite a fall! you wouldn't want to spend the fourth of July in the hospital, would you?\n\n\n\nPort Authority officer two: Are you here to collect again?\n\n\n\nMe: Every night on the weekends. $25, Please.\n\n\n\nPort Authority officer two: Why don't you let me get that, he's had a few.\n\n\n\nPort Authority officer two disembarks and takes the paperwork from me as Port authority officer one helps Willy back into his chair. Port Authority officer two goes back up to Willy and makes Willy hand over the money and sign time card. He then disembarks again and hands me the paperwork. It is at that moment I think full crazy finally set in on Willy because he starts trying to get my attention by yelling \"HEY!\" over and over again. I wait until I am done with the transaction with Port Authority officer two before I crane my neck up to look at him.\n\n\n\nWilly: Hey HEEEEy HEeEeY!!!\n\n\n\nMe: Yes, Sir?\n\n\n\nWilly: You ever work in textiles?\n\n\n\nMe: No, Sir.\n\n\n\nWilly: Well, you Never Will! I'll Make sure of it!\n\n\n\nMe: Okay.\n\n\n\nWilly: Do You Hear Me? NEVER!\n\n\n\nMe: Okay.\n\n\n\nWilly then proceeds to try and stand again but both officers coax him back down and gesture for me to leave. I spent the rest of the night working at a rapid pace that left everything in a daze, except for the occasional screech from Willy's boat of \"NEVER! DO you hear me?!\"\n\n\n\nWhen I came in the next weekend, the boat was finally gone, and the water taxi finally got their spot back. I still wonder if there are message boards around the Internet with BOAT NAZI as the subject from time to time. \n\nEdit: For better timestamped Youtube URL, thanks to u/safely-read ",

        "text": "This was a friend of mine.\n\nMy friend was an industrial cook. He made things like 30 gallons of pudding, or 50 gallons of pie filling, to be packaged for retail sale. It was a more technical job than you’d think, especially with fruit, because different batches of fruit than came in had different PH, sugar content, moisture content, etc. Each recipe had different chemical parameters that had to be met to be an acceptable product. Sometimes this required a little variation on the recipe – more/less sugar or water and so on. You get the idea. My friend was very proud of getting good results, even if it took extra effort. Also, by not ruining batches, he saved the company money.\n\nAnyway, his boss didn’t understand that it was the end result that counted. He hated it when his workers made variations to meet the end requirement. One day he gives my friend a printed recipe and says, “I don’t want any changes to this, you understand? Do it exactly as it says on the card!”\n\nMy buddy immediately says, “This isn’t right…” But no, he was told to do exactly as the card said, or he’d be written up.\n\nFine. Whatever you say. The card specifically required him to make a 50-gallon batch of apple pie filling in a 30-gallon kettle.\n\nSo he starts putting apples and water in the kettle. It starts slogging over the side, getting on people on the lower level. But he needs to make it exactly as the recipe card says, or he’ll be written up. He keeps on adding ingredients. Sugar – all over the floor. Starch flying through the air. Then a pound of cinnamon. Guys are yelling at him, cussing him out, and the mess is just piling up, and he keeps adding ingredients. \n\nThe plant manager shows up. “WTF is going on?!!”\n\n“I was told to follow this recipe, or I would be written up. It says to make a 50 gallon batch, and to use this specific 30-gallon kettle.” \n\nThe plant manager looks at the card, then runs off screaming the name of my friend’s boss. BUT HE NEVER SAYS TO STOP MAKING THE BATCH.\n\nThey finally stopped him 15 minutes later, and it took 2 hours to clean up the mess. And, of course, all the supplies were ruined. He never got those instructions again. \n\n\n",

This was my first experience in a non-AP/Honors class since starting my high school career, and it was stunning to me to see how many of my peers (who eventually graduated standing shoulder-to-shoulder with me) were literally *incapable* of reading beyond a kindergarten level. But I just needed a passing grade in order to graduate, and the workload for non-AP English was so light that I spent most English periods joking around with my friends, not really paying much attention to the teacher.\n\nUntil one afternoon, when she (let's call her Mrs. Memphis) made a *slight* spelling error on the whiteboard (she wrote \"fourty\" instead of \"forty\").\n\nI raised my hand and waited for her to acknowledge me, which took a minute or so while she finished writing out the rest of the words on the board.\n\nEventually, she turned around and noticed my hand in the air. She sighed (probably expecting me to make a wise-ass comment, which, to be fair, I did pretty frequently). \"Yes, slashclee?\"\n\nMe: \"I think you misspelled a word on the board there.\"\n\nMrs. Memphis looked back and quickly scanned the board to check her work, then turned back to me and replied, \"I don't think so.\"\n\nMe: \"I'm pretty sure 'forty' doesn't have a *u* in it, Mrs. Memphis.\"\n\nI will never forget her response.\n\n\"Well, Mr. slashclee, **one** of us has been teaching English for a decade, and the other dropped from AP to regular English, so I think I know which spelling is correct. But if you really want to embarrass yourself, you're welcome to prove me right by looking it up in the dictionary!\"\n\nShe capped it off with a shit-eating grin and a little flourish of her hand indicating the location of the classroom's dictionary, in case I was too dumb to know where it was already.\n\nI got up and walked over to the shelf with the dictionary, pulled it down, and leafed through it right there. I found the entry for \"forty\" (without the *u*, because of course there's no *u* in *forty*) and brought it to her.\n\nShe walked up to the whiteboard, erased \"fourty\", rewrote it without the \"u\", and didn't say another word to me the rest of the period.\n\nNobody broke out into applause, but someone in the class did call out \"DAAAAAMN\" as I walked back to my desk.",

I get along with everyone well here, though there are a couple people I keep at distance. I was in an incident today with one of those peope. We'll call him 'Grumpy'. \n\nAs the name implies, he is quick to anger. Sometimes he's in a good mood and he's fine to talk to. More often, however, he comes in sulking and the only person he'll be nice to is his rehab buddy and he'll usually just ignore everyone else. He also likes to drive the machines as fast as he can and his temper only makes this worse.\n\nI'm pulling my order using one of the machines and come to a high-traffic intersection so I slow down and start honking. I see Grumpy coming the other way so I stop. He is going way to fast to stop, tries to turn to avoid a collision, and ends up knocking out a shelf. He get off his lift, takes his earbuds out and tells me \"Use your fucking horn more\". \n\nI explain to him that if he didn't have music in his ear he might have heard me. He starts to argue again but I just walk away and take his advice as an opportunity to grow. He's right I can always use my horn more. \n\nThanks to the teachings of this sub, I knew exactly what to do. All day I've been driving the machines beeping the horns as much as possible. There has to be less than a second between each time I honk. Any time grumpy and I cross paths I make sure to look him in the eye and press it continuously. \n\nIt's already getting to him. He's pissed off hiding in the corner shouting at the pallets he's checking in. I'll keep it updated if any more progresses. I'm trying to give the whole building a headache lol. ",

        "text": "So I wrote something before about my grandpa [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/8pme7b/another_captain_grandpa_story/) and [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/8pfek6/my_grandpa_is_a_badass_lets_hope_the_genes_passed/).\n\nI met up with my grandparents Sunday and told my grandpa that i told some people on the internet his stories, he thought that was funny. And he told me another one we might like.  \n\nAfter my grandpa stopped being a captain he and my Nan became a bridge keepers. Included in that job was a house next to the bridge. From the front door to the bridge cabin was 50m/165f. \n\nMy grandpa and nan where the main bridgekeepers there both fulltime. So maybe 1 day or half a day a week there would be somebody else who did not live next the bridge. Then you would sit your whole shift in the cabin maybe listen some radio and later they got tv and even later internet. \n\nBut because my grandparents lived next to the bridge they would just be at home or in the garden. When a boat came (some days less then 5 depending on weather) he would get called up by VHF or boat horn honking. He would walk over open the bridge let the boat thorough close the bridge and go back home. \n\nIn my country its kinda normal to have 2 coffee breaks a day 1 in the morning and 1 in the afternoon. Grandpa would have coffee at home and no problems so far.\n\nThen one day somebody from the office decided he was not allowed to be home when he was on shift. He would have to stay all day in the cabin like the other people who did not live close. My grandpa did not like that but he complied kinda. \n\nBut he now started adding his coffee break times to his hours (40 min a day) Also now the cabin needed to have allot more coffee suplies so he kept sending bills for it.\n\nAt the next quarterly review the amount of overtime for my grandparents was 3.5h a week resulting in 50\\+ OT hours. And allot of coffee. \n\nHe got another call from the office why he was declaring so much more costs and where all the extra hours where coming from. He said to her that she told him he was not allowed to go drink coffee at home so they would have to supply him with coffee now. And that he was not taking official break anymore cause he did not see the point to having a break all by himself in the cabin.\n\nShe was not happy with all the extra costs so grandpa made her an offer, if he was allowed to go home when there was no boat they could forget about the OT hours. (Not like he really worked them he still went home) She accepted and for the next 30\\+ years he opened the bridges with my nan. And spend more time maintaining the garden and the house then being in the bridge cabin. \n\nBest Job Ever",

        "text": "Background: I work as a front office manager in a client facing position. My primary role is to register clients, do paperwork, and solve any issues related to this. My office is right at the front, so when clients walk in, I (used to) go greet them, direct them to their location for the day, and give them the rules, etcetera. \n\nI have a fellow manager, who also works directly with clients. But he’s a lazy, useless employee, and though technically doing greetings and introductions is his job, I did it for him, because he often couldn’t be bothered to walk a hundred yards to do his job properly. \n\nSo here we are. It’s a busy day. I’m running between welcoming clients, registering them, and sending them off, multiple different parties at a time. There’s lots of people around, one of me, and I’m still working with a ten minute maximum turnaround time, which for my role is very impressive. I’ve got these people in and out as fast as possible, while also doing someone else’s job for them. The other manager is nowhere to be seen until the very end of the day, when he marches into my office. \n\n“What the fuck are you doing? Why are you greeting clients?” And so on and so forth. For a solid ten minutes. He even goes so far as to imply that because I’m a woman, my only role should be doing the paperwork while he does the real man’s work.\n\nI’m so unbelievably pissed at this. I basically ran our operation the whole day while he fucked off somewhere, god only knows where, and he now has the nerve to scream at me. He finishes with a “don’t ever do that again.” First, he doesn’t have any authority over me. We’re of equal rank, with different roles. There was one other manager in the office with me going over paperwork, and he was so shocked he couldn’t even retaliate. I’m two seconds away from taking this asshole’s head off. \n\n“Okay, I won’t.” \n\nI then march out, because things would have gone very poorly if I had stayed.\n\nCue the next day. Asshole manager comes up to me and tries to apologize, while also one hundred percent not really apologizing, at all. He repeats much of the same shit said the day before, and still seems to not recognize the fatal flaw in his plan of screaming at me for doing his job, which is that now he’s gonna have to actually work. \n\nI nod, smile, and fuck right off to my office.\n\nWhich I proceed to not leave for the next eight hours.\n\nI do exactly what my job is. I register clients. I do paperwork. That is it. I can see clients walking into the building, confused, obviously needing help, or expecting a greeting. \n\nBut hey. That’s not my job.\n\nAsshole manager, after his half assed apology, had disappeared again, so I call him down.\n\n“You’ve got clients waiting,” I tell him.\n\nHe gets there, late, and has a horde of angry clients waiting for him to actually do his job. There’s so many of them because he’s late that it’s now his turn to spend the next six hours running around like a chicken with his head cut off, while I have a great time leisurely doing my job exactly to the limits of the description, nothing more. By the end of the day, I’m feeling great, the clients are happy with my work- but the complaints are rolling in for him. He comes in at the end of the day again, obviously ready to yell.\n\n“I had a great day. So much easier to get everything done when I’m not doing someone else’s work for them,” I tell him. “By the way, I had time to process the customer requests for the week since I wasn’t busy greeting. Here’s your complaints.”\n\nAnd I proceed to hand him a very thick stack of complaints concerning turnaround time, confusing directions, lack of space, and so on. Everything relating to his role. \n\n“Have a nice night.”\n\nAnd I leave. Haven’t done his job for him since, and he hasn’t gotten any better at it. It only gets funnier every time. ",

I'd bring my lunch with me and eat it at my desk rather than take a break for lunch, and having not taken one, I'd leave an hour earlier than everyone else to enjoy an extended evening.\n\nOne day, my boss calls me into his office. He remarks that he's concerned that I'm leaving early all the time and that he's not getting what he's paying for. I explain to him the situation-- I don't take breaks, and I eat while I work. It just works better for me.\n\nI also happen to know my performance is stellar. When I arrived at the company, our website couldn't go five minutes without throwing an error, and now it was rare that one ever appeared. So I'm not having the claim that he's not getting what he's paying for, and point out the empirical facts of my performance.\n\nHe's still not satisfied. He says 'why don't you take some breaks during the day?' The conversation goes like this:\n\n\n**Me:** Hmm. I guess I could take breaks, yes.\n\n**Him:** Excellent!\n\n**Me:** What about, say, 15 minute breaks every so often? Like, four times a day?\n\n**Him:** That sounds perfect.\n\n**Me:** Hey, wait, I have an idea. What if I take all of my fifteen minute breaks, and put them together in one long break? That'd be an hour. I could put it at the end of my day, and then I could leave an hour early!\n\n**Him:** ...I see what you mean now.\n\n\nI walked out of that office with my schedule unadjusted.",

        "text": "Not sure if this counts as full compliance, but it was satisfying enough. This happened a few years back, when I was still in high school. High school in my country takes place from 13-16 years of age, for four years.\n\nMy school, being a private school, had certain programs that they expected all students to participate in, no questions asked, even though we could technically contact the school to withdraw. In our third year, it was 'compulsory' for every student to participate in what was basically an overseas trip. Not for volunteering, not for studying, just for fun.\n\nWe could choose from various destinations, but point was that it was pretty expensive. $6000-$8000 to get to Europe, $3000-$5000 to go to China for two weeks... pretty ridiculous prices when my dad could get me to the same destination in China for 3 weeks with a maximum of $2000. So my dad suggested to the school that he would bring me to China for three weeks instead of following the lost sheep and burning an extra thousand bucks for nothing. The school eventually agreed that it would serve the same purpose and let me off the official school trips.\n\nThe thing about schools is that they always love paperwork. You want anything? Get your parents to write a letter, sign it, send it back. Your parents want something? Ask them to make their statement, sign it, send it back. Everything ended in my dad writing some letter and signing it. And... as usual, they pestered us for a letter to state that I would not participate in the overseas trips.\n\nWe thought it was pretty ridiculous for them to insist that we attend a trip spending a minimum of $3000 for just two weeks overseas (in China to boot, not the fancy schmancy European dreamboats), especially when I was on financial aid and the school offered no subsidy on this program at all. So my dad fought back.\n\nOne thing that I've noticed about my teachers is that they love to email. They aren't so good at direct verbal confrontations. Unfortunately for them, my dad can talk the hind leg off the donkey, and he'd much rather have a phone call than email (even though he's perfectly tech-savvy). A teacher called (at my refusal to give an email instead of my dad's phone number) to try to convince my dad that I should follow the crowd and pay overpriced travel expenses to join the school trips, and my dad got fed up. My dad explained that he was already making up for the 'compulsory' experience by bringing me to China for three weeks. The teacher was convinced to allow me to withdraw from the official trips, but insisted that the school needed to receive a signed letter stating my absence and the reasons.\n\nMy dad tried to convince the teacher that the trip being compulsory was ridiculous to begin with, and how it shouldn't require a written statement. After all, this wasn't an official activity that had to be accounted to the education ministry. The teacher insisted, and pushed, and pushed.\n\nMy dad lost it. \"You want a letter? You write it. I'll sign it. Come on, YOU write it now and email it to me. I'll sign it right now and fax it back.\" It was probably at this point that my teacher realised she made a mistake. And it was pretty obvious she wouldn't win my father in any verbal argument. So she tried to bail.\n\nShe started to give every sort of excuse and tried to tell my dad that the letter was not really necessary, she would just let it go... Not happening. She wanted a letter, she would get one. My dad was done with this paperwork nonsense: \"No, you wanted a leter, you'll get it. Write it now. I'll sign it. You get exactly what you asked for.\"\n\nI won't say the teacher was wrong for requesting a written statement, it was pretty standard protocol at my school, but it was honestly pretty annoying. I had to submit a letter for being tardy, submit a letter to just prove that my dad read my grades, submit this, submit that... so it was pretty damn satisfying when the teacher really got a signed letter... written by herself.\n\nTL;DR, teacher insists on following protocol and insists upon receiving a signed statement from my father to withdraw from a ridiculously overpriced school trip, gets browbeaten into writing the statement herself for my father to sign.",

        "text": "So this happened about 6 years ago during my time working at a call centre when work was slow (I usually work construction).  I don know how it was compare to other post here but God, this woman just wouldn’t listen.\n\nIt's nearing the end of my shift at a call centre that employs people to work on a contract for a large savings and investment group in the UK, mainly dealing with savings... and old people, seeing as thats where most go to get their pension, generally most customers have a small to modest amount of savings, but generally low. We where offering at the time a 2.7&amp;#37; 1 year and I think 3.5&amp;#37; 3 year with somewhere in between for 2. Which was on average a point higher than most.\n\nSo I get a call from an old woman, maybe just past 60, get the account number from her to pull up the details when she asks if the call is costing her money and going on about how much these calls cost blah blah blah. It could have depending on what number she called as sales and customer service came through to me. I inform her that I could certainly call her back as I didn't know what number she came through on, but being in a good mood and helpful knowing this was my last call I didn’t mind, I had some discretion in call backs as I also dealt with complaints. This would be the last time I ever offered that.  \n \n\nSo I call OL (Old Lady) back and run through the usual security, all fine. Then I get access to her account, I was stunned, although I probably shouldn’t have been, over a variety of accounts she had in excess of 7 million pounds sitting in maturity accounts from bonds that had since expired (not really generating much interest). I explained to her the options available and how to get about opening her new account, none of which I was able to do for her over the phone and all in the branch. There was a back and forth for maybe about 15 minutes of her trying to trip me up and get different anwers, but it was pretty straight forward. Go to branch with a cheque. This is when she started to get very flustered and annoyed. The conversation went something along the lines of threatening account closure, the usual….  \n \n\nOL ‘’I do not want to go to the branch, you are going to put my money into new bonds for me now”  \n \n\nMe “As I have said before OL, given that these accounts are fixed term and can generate penalties for early closure it is something that requires a signature, you’ll have to go to branch”  \n \n\nOL “No, I think ill just close all the accounts and just take my money elsewhere” (Bluff)  \n \n\nMe ”Unfortunately an account closure will also require a signature I can however send you a cheque which should trigger a closure and the remaining interest sent to you separately, would you like that?”  \n \n\nAfter this I confirmed that her address was correct, as my shift had ended I was tired of her bluffs.  \n There was another back and forth about opening account on the phone before she said..\\\\\n\nOL “okay give me all my money, ill go to XXXX instead.”  \n \n\nAt this point I went through each account and sent the cheques, it took about 15 seconds.  \n \n\nOL ’’So now can you open the account I’ve asked for?”\n\nMe “As I’ve said the accounts can only be opened at branch you can take your cheques to the branch and open them directly with them, is there anything else you can help me with?”  \n \n\nOL “………..What do you mean with my cheques?”  \n \n\nMe “As requested I’ve sent the remainder of the money in the accounts to you, the accounts will close within the next few days and any interested remaining sent after, is there anything else I can help you with?”\n\nOL ‘’ …… but I’ve only just said it, cant you just not send them?’’  \n \n\nMe ‘’The money has now been withdrawn from the account and cheques will be processed else where, you will now have to wait until you receive those cheques and take them to your local branch if you want to re\\-invest, is there anything else I can help you with.”  \n \n\nOL “………No thank\\-you”\n\nClick\n\nEnd call",
