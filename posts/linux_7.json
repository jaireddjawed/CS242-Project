        "text": "I am a proud Linux user (don't use Arch btw). Recently, I was reading research papers in my area of research \"physics informed neural networks\".  I realised that people who disclose the PC's config in the research papers are either using Linux or WSL. They won't say they used Windows.\n\nYou just need to search these terms in Google scholar.\n\n1. For papers using WSL : [link](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C5&amp;q=physics+informed+neural+networks+%22Windows+Subsystem+for+Linux%22&amp;btnG=)\n2. For papers using Linux : [link](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C5&amp;q=physics+informed+neural+networks+%22Linux%22&amp;btnG=)\n3. For papers using Windows : [link](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C5&amp;q=physics+informed+neural+networks+%22Windows%22&amp;btnG=)\n\nThis makes me real sad. People are actually using Linux but within Windows. These people are some of the most intelligent minds in their area of expertise. They are from NASA ([this one](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fspas.2021.732275/full)), and top universities of the world in my research area. You can find a similar trend unless you enter in the research involving servers (might be incorrect) where you can't use Windows.Of course these people are not dumb, but they are even 100 times more technical in maths, computer science and electronics than a average \"I use Arch btw\" user.Why these smart people are also using Windows, specifically WSL but not just Linux? These people generally work in R&amp;D and can't be forced to use Windows. They generally choose to use Windows, possibly, because it comes preinstalled?  \n\n\n**EDIT**\n\nFor anyone reading this. I am not trying to **force to use** or **insult** anyone by saying \"why they don't use Linux\". I am trying to understand the challenges and potential solution to lure these talented individuals to Linux. ",

Why use macros and not of functions?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy initial guess was that this approach prevents the creation of new stack frames which is good since the kernel stack is limited.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSomething, however, tells me that there might be more to this and that my initial guess may not be as accurate. So I would like to know if someone could educate me on this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis also raises another question, which has to do with good software writing practices (which is something I AM NOT very knowlegeable about) in C/C++ in particular. When should one use macros and when should one opt for functions instead? What is the deciding factor? Besides the obvious \"less stack frames\", what is the advantage of macro blocks over functions?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPS: I apologize if this question sounds stupid, but it's one which has been bugging me for some time now.",

        "text": "I've been going down this rabbit hole for a few days now and I think it only made things worse. I think it's important to give some context for those of you who haven't followed the last few releases of some popular Linux distros. Fedora and PopOS have swap on zram by default, while Ubuntu and Arch have zswap enabled by default.\n\n[From the Kernel documentation](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/mm/zswap.html), zswap can be summarised as:\n\n&gt;Zswap is a lightweight compressed cache for swap pages. It takes pages that are in the process of being swapped out and attempts to compress them into a dynamically allocated RAM-based memory pool.  zswap basically trades CPU cycles for potentially reduced swap I/O.  This trade-off can also result in a significant performance improvement if reads from the compressed cache are faster than reads from a swap device.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Some potential benefits:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Desktop/laptop users with limited RAM capacities can mitigate the performance impact of swapping.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Overcommitted guests that share a common I/O resource can dramatically reduce their swap I/O pressure, avoiding heavy handed I/O throttling by the hypervisor. This allows more work to get done with less impact to the guest workload and guests sharing the I/O subsystem  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Users with SSDs as swap devices can extend the life of the device by drastically reducing life-shortening writes.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Zswap evicts pages from compressed cache on an LRU basis to the backing swap device when the compressed pool reaches its size limit.\n\n[And, from the Gentoo Wiki, zram can be summarised as:](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Zram)\n\n&gt;**zram** (previously called **compcache**) is a Linux kernel feature and userspace tools for creating compressible RAM-based block devices. It has been included as a module  of the mainline Linux kernel since version 3.14. Starting with kernel  version 3.15, zram supports multiple compression streams and the ability  to change the compression algorithms without a system restart.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;The zram kernel module enables support for creating compressed block devices in RAM. These block devices can then be used for swap or general purpose RAM disks. Popular uses for it on Gentoo are to  extend the available amount of RAM to processes (swap space), virtualize  /tmp, and /var/tmp/portage - which is Portage's temporary directory used for software compilation.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;The RAM used for the block device is dynamically obtained and released up to its predefined uncompressed maximum size. The way it  extends the amount of available RAM to a system is by using a portion of  the RAM as compressed swap. It can therefore hold more pages of memory  in the compressed swap than the amount of actual memory used. \n\nSo, in short, we have 2 extremely similar solutions that diverge in a few key points:\n\n* Zswap is a dynamic memory pool used to compress swap pages. It intercepts the pages before they actually hit your normal swap partition/file and evicts old pages on a LRU basis. The key point here is that zswap does not replace your classic swap, it is design to work alongside it as an intermediate step.\n* Zram, on another hand, is a dynamically-allocated and compressible ram disk that can be used to store anything, although the most common use case is to use it as your swap partition. Unlike zswap, zram does not require a normal swap partition/file to be present on your disk, as it will act as the actual swap partition. However, since Linux 4.14, zram can now also be configured with a \"writeback\" device (CONFIG\\_ZRAM\\_WRITEBACK), which allows it to move idle/incompressible pages to a different swap partition (usually on the disk), which is exactly what zswap does.\n\nBefore CONFIG\\_ZRAM\\_WRITEBACK was a thing, using a normal swap partition/file alongside swap on zram was generally considered to be a bad practice, since it could cause LRU inversion (the faster swap partition would get filled first, which means newer pages would end up on the slower partition eventually). \n\nAs a general rule of thumb, it was reasonable to use zswap if you planned on having a normal swap partition/file on disk, and swap on zram if you didn't. This made perfect sense and it's an intuitive conclusion. However, now that zram can also be configured to do what zswap does by default, it's a bit unclear when you should use which one and how they differ in practice.",
