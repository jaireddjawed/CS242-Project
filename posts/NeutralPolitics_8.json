Human Rights Council over, or least in part because: \n\n&gt; in protest of its frequent criticism of Israel’s treatment of Palestinians.\n\nNikki Haley, U.S. ambassador to the U.N.,  elaborated on the decision: \n\n&gt; “Earlier this year, as it has in previous years, the Human Rights Council passed five resolutions against Israel — more than the number passed against North Korea, Iran and Syria combined,” Nikki R. Haley, the American ambassador to the United Nations, said in a speech on Tuesday. “This disproportionate focus and unending hostility toward Israel is clear proof that the council is motivated by political bias, not by human rights.”\n\n&gt; “If the Human Rights Council is going to attack countries that uphold human rights and shield countries that abuse human rights, then America should not provide it with any credibility,” Ms. Haley said.\n\n-----------------------\n\nFormer Republican diplomat Elliot Abrams briefly touched on an argument for staying, but agreed that the Council's bias against Israel is too much to ignore and leaving is the right decision, saying: \n\n&gt; “There is always an argument for staying, which is that the United States will be in a better position to help defend Israel,” Mr. Abrams said. “But this council is hopelessly compromised, so leaving is the right choice.”\n\n--------------------------------\n\nRob Berschinski, a senior vice president at Human Rights First, agreed the Council is not perfect, but made the argument the U.S. is potentially giving up leverage:\n\n&gt; “Countries like China, Russia and Venezuela will applaud this decision because we are freely giving up leverage over them that we previously had,” Mr. Berschinski said.\n\n--------------------------------\n\n1: From the perspective of the United States, what are the arguments or pros and cons of the United States leaving the U.N. Human Rights Council?\n\n2: If at all, how does this affect the Council's credibility?\n\n\n",

According to the article, Homeland Security spokesman Tyler Houlton is quoted in saying in regard to the \"catch and release policy\"\n&gt;Those who break our immigration laws have continued to exploit legal loopholes to the detriment of our national security and the safety of the American people \n\nTo summarize \"catch and release\" policy, [Wikipedia summarizes it as Catch and release is the unofficial name of a protocol that has been followed by immigration enforcement agencies in the United States such as ICE and U.S. Customs and Border Protection under which people caught in unlawful immigration status are released while they wait for a hearing with an immigration judge.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catch_and_release_(U.S._immigration_policy)\n\nQuestions: \n\n1: Does catching and releasing people who illegally cross the border create \"public safety risk\"? \n\n2: Is there a better alternative to \"catch and release\" policy(other than DACA, which president Trump has canceled)? \n\n3:The article by Washington post states that \"many released minors — nearly 70 percent of whom are teenage boys — have not shown up for their deportation hearings.\" How can this problem be solved? \n\nEDIT: The article by WaPo was written in April of 2018, so I'm not sure if \"Catch and Release\" completely stopped after the creation of no tolerance policy. However, I think it's still good to answer the question as president Trump has still called for [end of \"catch and release policy](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1007671131841671169).",

        "text": "According to [this NPR article](https://www.npr.org/2018/06/16/620451012/dhs-nearly-2-000-children-separated-from-adults-at-border-in-six-weeks) \"1,995 minors were separated from their \"alleged adult guardians\" at the southern border in just over a monthlong period\", following DOJ's new \"[zero tolerance](https://www.dhs.gov/news/2018/06/15/fact-sheet-zero-tolerance-immigration-prosecutions-families)\" policy for illegal crossings. In part, the policy states\n\n\"The Attorney General directed United States Attorneys on the Southwest Border to prosecute all amenable adults who illegally enter the country, including those accompanied by their children, for 8 U.S.C. § 1325(a), illegal entry.\n\n\"Children whose parents are referred for prosecution will be placed with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR).\"\n\nWhile the separation of children from their parents has been widely condemned by [people on both sides of the aisle](https://www.dallasnews.com/news/immigration/2018/06/18/beyond-laura-bush-texans-saying-separating-immigrant-children-parents-border), there seems to be considerable disagreement about what is actually happening, and why\n\n[This ](https://www.nationalreview.com/2018/05/illegal-immigration-enforcement-separating-kids-at-border/)article by the National Review claims, in part, that the only children being separated from their parents, are family units who did not seek asylum at the border (crossed illegally) and are being referred for criminal prosecution, a misdemeanor (for first time crossers). If they plead guilty, they and their child are returned to the country of origin. However, in many of these cases, aliens then make an asylum claim, which begins a more lengthy process, where the children continue to be separated from their parents. Per the  Flores Consent Decree of 1997, the government is not allowed to hold unaccompanied children longer than 20 days, and, per a 9th circuit ruling, this includes children held as part of a family unit. The article claims that, historically, family units were released at or before the 20 day limit, pending asylum adjudication, but they often failed to attend their hearing, and remained in the U.S. illegally.\n\nAdditionally, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen in a series of [Tweets](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/dhs-secretary-defends-trump-administrations-migrant-policies/ar-AAyMAZ7?OCID=ansmsnnews11), claimed that asylum seekers who sought asylum at a port of entry would not be separated from their children, and/or there is no policy of doing so.\n\nThe \"zero tolerance\" policy supporters, including Attorney General Jeff Sessions, maintain it is necessary to discourage families from putting their children in danger via illegal border crossings, and that \"[Orderly and lawful processes are good in themselves and protect the weak and lawful](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/06/16/jeff-sessions-bible-romans-13-trump-immigration-policy/707749002/). \"\n\nOn the flip side, even if an alien entered the country illegally, they may still file an [asylum claim within one year](https://www.uscis.gov/humanitarian/refugees-asylum/asylum/questions-and-answers-asylum-eligibility-and-applications). The previously cited NPR source also claims that the ORR is having trouble placing the children, because \"the parents are being incarcerated or otherwise held\", and the family of these children are unwilling to come forward, out of fear they will be arrested. ORR is currently sharing sponsor information with DHS, further stoking these fears. According to [this](https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/18/politics/immigration-trump-congress-family-separation/index.html) CNN article, the House is currently debating a bill that would overrule the 20 day limit, allowing families to be kept indefinitely at ICE family facilities.\n\nSo, to restate the question, under what circumstances are children being separated from their family? What alternatives are available under existing or proposed laws?",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/8qvwvw/meta_reminders_and_clarifications_about_the_rules/",
        "text": "Dear users,\n\nThe mods here feel like it's time for some reminders about how this subreddit is run.\n\nPrimarily, as we write at the top of every post:\n\n&gt; /r/NeutralPolitics is a curated space. \n\n&gt; In order not to get your comment removed, please familiarize yourself with our [rules on commenting](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines#wiki_comment_rules) before you participate.\n\nA lot of people seem to ignore this, but we're begging you… **please read the rules!**\n\nNow, here are a few refreshers on the specifics…\n\n**Why are sources required?**\n\nThe requirement to provide sources for all assertions of fact (Rule 2) is part of the [founding ethos of this subreddit.](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/4cxvz1/meta_neutralpolitics_origins_and_purpose/) Many things people believe to be true are, in fact, not. Providing sources is the best way to support your assertions. It is our cornerstone philosophy.\n\n**How to handle requests for sources.**\n\nCommenters should respond to any reasonable request for sources as an honest inquiry made in good faith. What may seem \"obvious\" or \"common sense\" to you is often not to others. So, if somebody — mod or user — asks you to support your statement, please just comply. You might end up teaching something, or learning something, or both. Assertions of fact require sources on NeutralPolitics and requests for such sources are part of the deal. They're not an assault or a challenge. Think of them as an invitation to provide knowledge.\n\n**\"You can just google it.\"**\n\nNo. It's the responsibility of the person making the claim to support it. It's also far more efficient for the one person making the assertion to link to the source than to charge thousands of individual readers with supporting it.\n\n**There's no exception for \"common knowledge.\"**\n\n[This is explicitly stated in the rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines#wiki_rule_2.3A_source_your_facts) because \"common knowledge\" is poorly defined and completely subjective. What qualifies as common knowledge to one person might be a shocking fact to another. For example, people who are new to a topic or are from cultures other than the dominant one in the discussion may have no idea about these supposedly \"common\" pieces of knowledge.\n\nAdditionally, statements of \"common knowledge\" are often wrong. The fact that a large number of people may believe something has [no bearing on whether or not it's true.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argumentum_ad_populum)\n\nWe occasionally get pushback from users on this point, and it often takes the form of something like, \"Do I have to source that the sky is blue?\" This is a convenient example for a few reasons:\n\n1. The sky is *not* blue. It only looks that way to us because of [human physiology](https://www.livescience.com/320-blue-skies-eye-beholder.html) and how the [light scatters through the atmosphere.](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/blue-sky/en/)\n2. Even at that, it doesn't always appear blue. It's red and orange at sunrise and sunset, white on an overcast day, gray when there are rain clouds, and black at night.\n3. Finally, this is a political discussion forum, so any assertion about the color of the sky is likely to be removed for being off topic. The same goes for similar examples, like \"water is wet.\" When we get into political topics, there's actually much *less* agreement on what constitutes common knowledge, so we don't accept any of it.\n\n**Removal reasons (we don't always post them)**\n\nThe mods try to reply with a reason for each removed comment. However, users have repeatedly complained that heavily redacted threads get crowded with removal reasons, making it hard to find the actual content. \n\nThat in mind, there are some situations where we don't post them. The most common is when they're in a chain that is off-topic or stemming from a rule-violating comment. In that case, we'll just nuke the whole chain rather than post a dozen or so removal reasons. Comments that are just obvious trolling, spam or repeats may also be removed without notice.\n\nWhat this means is that you might not notice if your comment is removed. The best way to avoid this is to not violate the [rules on commenting](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines#wiki_comment_rules) in the first place, but if you have any doubt, you can also check the public mod logs.\n\n**Public mod logs**\n\nIn the interest of transparency, moderation logs are public on r/NeutralPolitics. We have [our own system](https://modlogs.fyi/r/NeutralPolitics) (there's also a link in the sidebar) or you can use [ceddit](https://www.ceddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics).\n\n\nThat's all. Feel free to post your questions or comments below.\n\nAs always, thanks for your participation.\n\n— r/NeutralPolitics mod team",

        "text": "Both the [Obama](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/obama-administration-will-no-longer-defend-doma/) and [Trump Administration](https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/24/us/24marriage.html)s have made novel assertions that when the Executive Branch finds that a law before the Judicial Branch is unconstitutional that there is no Executive Branch duty to defend it. Here are some constitutional issues that I am quite curious about:\n\nDoes the Constitution itself define who may invalidate laws for being unconstitutional? Are findings by branches other than the Judicial Branch precluded?\n\nAre the three branches of our Government presently [co-equal](http://www.providencejournal.com/blogs/20160413/myth-of-three-co-equal-branches-of-government-arises-again) in regard to a duty to interpret our Constitution?  \n\nJust as the Judicial Branch asserted a similar authority with [Marbury v. Madison](https://www.history.com/topics/marbury-v-madison) may the [unitary head of the Executive Branch](https://www.acslaw.org/acsblog/exploring-the-limits-of-presidential-power) now constitutionally make this same claim?\n\nDid the [Obama Administration challenge](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/obama-administration-will-no-longer-defend-doma/)  the sole authority of the Judicial Branch to make constitutional findings as articulated by [Marbury v. Madison](https://www.history.com/topics/marbury-v-madison)? If so, does this finding then affect the authority and jurisdiction of the Judicial Branch to hear this case?  Restated: Does the first branch to rule have primacy? Does the Judicial Branch have the same responsibility that the Executive has (if any) to respect findings as to constitutionality?\n\nAre [these two Executive Branch assertions](https://talkingpointsmemo.com/dc/breaking-trumps-justice-department-refuses-to-defend-obamacare-in-court) constitutional findings co-equal to a Judicial Branch finding?\n\nUnder what circumstances must the Executive Branch make a constitutionality finding? Does [Marbury v. Madison](https://www.history.com/topics/marbury-v-madison) preclude any constitutional interpretation by the Judicial Branch?\n\nDoes the Executive Branch’s claims to make a constitutional finding challenge the core constitutional principle for [the separation of powers](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/separation_of_powers)?  Since the constitutionality for these questions has then been decided by the co-equal Executive Branch is an additional finding by another branch constitutionally required? May our president now use these precedents to order that DOJ only enforce the constitutional finding by the President and not those of the Judicial Branch? If not, why not? [\"*The power of the Executive Branch is vested in the President of the United States, who also acts as head of state and Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces. The President is now responsible for implementing and enforcing the laws written by Congress.\"*](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/1600/executive-branch) Note that the White House omitted mention of the Judicial Branch.\n\nMay an executive order now make a finding that *any law* is unconstitutional? In this case must the DOJ enforce the finding by the Executive Branch or a contradictory Judicial Branch finding? [“Under 28 C.F.R. § 0.50, the Civil Rights Division has the responsibility for the enforcement of all federal civil rights statutes.”](https://www.justice.gov/usam/usam-8-2000-enforcement-civil-rights-civil-statutes) If the Executive Branch were to rewrite [28 C.F.R. § 0.50](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/28/0.50), what constitutional limitations would it be under?",
