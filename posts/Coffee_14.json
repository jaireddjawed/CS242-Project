I guess it's understandable since it isn't anything earth shattering.\n\nEither way I've been mixing and dabbling, measuring and switching but I feel like my coffee is just weak/ watery..\n\nIs it me, or the system?\n\nAm I messing up where I'm starting?\n\nSo I have a 12oz metal mug and I brew either Over Ice or Cold Brew because I don't like hot coffee.\n\nThese two settings do not fully fill the mug if I select XL so I use the XL Travel Mug setting. For Cold Brew this fills the mug up to a notch just below the rim that signifies where the plastic lid would seal if used. Over Ice fills about half and I then add ice to the same line to balance it out.\n\nBoth come out tasting near identical with very little difference.\n\nI bought a scale and hand grinder, I weigh everything in grams. So I weighed the mug empty, then ran a few dry runs to get an idea of the water level of a filled mug. Subtracted the difference to see what the general liquid amount was. Then I used this to the ratio people suggest for Coffee grams to Water.\n\nSo if I'm doing that part right, I came to around 19 grams of coffee. \n\nNow I've been toying on clicks for my hand grinder, I was around 15 then went up to maybe 17. Now I'm wondering should I dial back to 15 or maybe even lower? Again with searching what people are using click-wise for this system I never find much information.. only suggestions based around popular models.\n\nI know it's all trial and error, I was doing 15 grams at 15 clicks for instance before I tested the weight of the mug a few times. Each variable I change however the coffee seems to come out the same.\n\nAt the same time since I have a hand grinder and a scale now, I keep getting tempted to just try and make real cold brew since that's my actual preferred coffee. I do enjoy the system for its ease and when it's on point but it feels like for every one amazing coffee it brews I end up with 30 that are just wrong.\n\nI mix paper filters because the difference it minimal to me but I like to draw out some oils and grounds/silt that seem to always slip through. I've used different brands, brown/ white and bamboo with the taste seemingly almost identical to my senses.. Just in case anyone considers that may be playing a role in the mixed outcomes.",

I swear i thought i saw the McD worker pouring water into my cup.  i wrote that off as a isolated event.

Good news my new job has a super nice industrial ice maker. I’ve tried a few canned coffees from the grocery but they all seem to have milk and/or sweeteners.\n\nRecommendations for small coffee makers I could bring to work and keep at my desk? Nothing over $100. I could definitely try to thrift one.\n\nAre there individual size (bottled, canned, cartoned) coffees you recommend that I could order in multi-unit packages? I could pour these over ice. Preferably less than $2 each. \n\nThis is more for caffeine than high quality coffee, just need something better than brown water that smells burned and vague hints of coffee.",

        "text": "I really have been enjoying my Hario switch size 03 lately using a method similar to the clever brewer method James Hoffmann covered, but I’m looking for a way to brew a larger volume with similar results. My current method:\n\n1.\tHario V60 filters rinsed with water just off boil with switch closed until the brewer heats up. Discard the rinse water.  \n2.\tAdd 300 grams water to brewer with switch closed. \n3.\tAdd 19 gram freshly ground coffee. \n4.\tStir just enough to wet grounds.\n5.\tImmersion brew for two minutes. \n6.\tBreak the surface to let grounds settle. After 20-30 seconds, open the switch and let the brewer drain entirely. \n\nThe immersion brewing aspect of this really makes the method foolproof. Very little need to dial-in and if I forget about it and let it run too long before draining it still turns out great. \n\nHow can I best adapt this method to 600-900 mL while still retaining the foolproof and effortless aspects of my current method? Three options I’m considering:\n\nA, pour over then immersion: Perform steps 1- 4 with the full amount of coffee. Add as much water as the brewer can hold, stir, then open the switch. Brew in pour over mode with the switch open until all the water is delivered with a full brewer. Close the switch and the proceed with immersion brewing for 2 minutes (steps 5-6). \n\nB, immersion then pour over: Perform steps 1-5 with the full amount of coffee and the max water that the brewer will allow. Open with switch and add the remaining water in pour over mode. \n\nC, double immersion: Perform steps 1-6 with the full amount of coffee and half the total water. After the first half of water drains, repeat with the second half. \n\nI’m shying away from B, because the water in the brewer will cool down and cause the second water addition to not be as hot. \n\nAny reason to be worried about over/under extraction with A or C?",

I went 3 times, but the first two times I noticed something strange.\n\nThe first time I ordered some kind of specialty iced coffee and later had weird mild asthma. I do have asthma but it’s very mild to the point where I don’t normally have to use an inhaler ever and the last time I had an asthma attack was six years ago. I took a Benadryl and it went away but it was just really weird and I thought it might be weather related.\n\nThe next day we go back to the coffee shop and I got a hazelnut flavored coffee. I do not have any known allergies and I drink Hazelnut drinks all the time, but I seemed to get another reaction where I had minor chest tightness. This made me realize that it was probably the coffee because I’ve been to San Diego my entire life and lived there at one point and the weather never gives me any problems.\n\nI feel bad because I really love supporting small businesses and I still gave them a good review, but I almost want to ask them what they put in their drinks that could have made me have this reaction. Should note that no one else in my family had this kind of reaction and I have 3 siblings. \n\nThe only time I didn’t get some reaction from the coffee was when I order a regular small coffee, so I have to think it’s something with one of their syrups?

        "text": "Kafi luwak is appropriately out of favor, because force feeding civets with coffee berries is cruel—like pumping food into a goose to get a huge liver to make pate. Now coffee beans that passed through elephants are  available, although the claim that this is only a fraction of their feed undermines the claim of quality. A friend of mine wants to know how he can consume the berries and pick out the beans from his excrement.  How is this working out for people who produce beans treated in this manner?  Is there already a name for the product or the process?",

        "text": "Hi all,\nI'm currently using a cheap Electric burr grinder that I've had for almost 9 years I'd say. It's reaching it's end of life and it's very noisy when my little 3 year old is in bed. I will be replacing with an electric grinder down the road but I'm interested in a manual hand grinder for the experience and the quietness it offers.\nI'm looking at the Timemore C3 currently as it's a good price on amazon at €85. Another one that I seen was the Timemore Chestnut g1 for €160.\nWould anyone have any advice between the two? Is one worth it over the other?",
