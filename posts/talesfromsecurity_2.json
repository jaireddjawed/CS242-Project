        "text": "A few years back, I worked part time as a bouncer at a well known club. \n\nIt came to kicking out time and we were doing our usual 'herd them towards the door' routine. Now I'm about average height but I was quite broad at the time. I pass by this guy about 6 inches taller than me but he was a monster. I mean biceps as thick as my thighs. I'd shouted in his direction a few times but he hasn't moved. \n\nAbout the fourth time round, I stand my ground and tell me to move. He says, in an accent not from our town, \"Yeah mate. I'll go now\". I said, \"You've said that three times. Round here when we say 'now', we mean 'NOW'\". \n\nThe gorgeous blonde girl he'd been talking to turned and began mocking what I'd said. She had an even more distinct out-of-town accent. Without breaking eye contact with him, I point at her and say, \"Sweetheart, if I had that accent, I'd never open my open my mouth in public\". The big guy was pretty incensed at this and squared up to me. I snorted and asked what the fuck he was gonna do. He glared at me, took her hand then walked outside. \n\nThat was OK and no further incidents came to pass. At the end of the night, I was chatting to the head bouncer. \"Any problems?\", he asked. \n\"Nah, just some big guy who thought he was something\". He furrowed his brow and said, \"Big guy, shaved head, grey t shirt?\" \n\"Yeah, same one. You have trouble with him too?\" I asked. \n\nHe took out his phone and scrolled to a picture obviously taken that night of himself with the man in question, all smiles and hugs.\nHe half laughed in disbelief and asked, \"Do you know who he is?\" \n\nI confirmed I did not.\nThe next question made my heart skip a beat.\n\n\"Do you ever watch UFC?\" \n\nOnce again I confirmed to the negative.\n\n\"Well, he's the current ***** champion\". \n\n\"And the hot blonde?\"\n\n\"His wife\".\n\nSo I'd not only pissed off a UFC champion, I'd also insulted his beautiful wife. I don't think there's a jury in the land would have convicted him had he chosen to separate my head from my shoulders. Seems an earpiece and a radio made me feel pretty much invincible!\n\nTL;DR Pissed off a UFC champion and insulted his wife.",

        "text": "The story surrounding the first time I was hit can be found here: https://redd.it/7d2d9y\n\nThey're not related other than that they both involve me, but in the interest of keeping things organized I have provided the link for you here.\n\nWhile this incident wasn't nearly as exciting or as violent as the previous one, there were a number of parts I found amusing.\n\nIt was some time after the events of the previous incident, precisely when I can't really recall, but it happened during the winter. I was manning the door when first a young woman, then a young man came blowing out the door, whacking me with it both times (I had been standing adjacent the door to open it for incoming patrons. It's not something I'm required to do, but they've always appreciated it) on their way out.\n\nAt this point I'm already pretty annoyed with them, but seconds later a bartender appears and points to both of them saying that they're not allowed back in. He doesn't give me much explanation, and to be honest I don't really need one, as the couple had now crossed the street to their parked vehicle, and had become embroiled in a rather intense screaming match.\n\nThey're both screaming, he's geting into and out of the car, slamming doors, telling her to get out, to which she screams back \"NO! AND YOU'RE PAYING ME DOUBLE FOR PUTTING UP WITH THIS BULLSHIT!\" At this point I figure the argument's over, he's gonna get in and slink away at the shame of his prostitute outing him in public. Right?\n\nWrong.\nHe slams the door a final time and makes a beeline for my door, I let some patrons in and move to intercept, holding the door shut with my arm as he goes to pull on it. His initial reaction is straight confusion, and I lead with \"Sorry man, can't let you in\" to which he immediately replies \"Why?\" Now after everything I've just witnessed, based on that alone I wouldn't let him in. He's furious and angry people have no place in a bar where people are trying to have fun. Of course I don't say that, and my mind immediately flutters back to the original reason, because I was told not to. So I say \"My manager said neither of you are allowed back in\" Indicating the young lady as well.\n\nThis leads to the same standard looping exchange of why and me repeating myself far more times than necessary. When he asks to speak to the manager, I reply with \"He doesn't want to talk to you\" again \"Why?\" \"Because it's not his job.\" Why?\" \"Because you've been kicked out.\" \n\nAt this point in the exchange he realizes he's going to get nothing out of me, and I'm simply not going to let him in. So he switches tactics, shouting \"You wont' let me in because I'm black, but you'll let her in?!\" Indicating his companion and I guess hoping to embarrass me into backing down with phony racism. Up until then I had still had been carding patrons as they had approached, with the last group going in having been a group of young black women. Now they were entering as they heard this, swiveled their heads long enough to give him a disproving look before proceeding inside.\n\nObviously he was trying everything he could to get in, no matter how categorically false it proved to be. But I simply replied \"As I said, neither of you are allowed in here\" He continued huffing and puffing with accusations of racism, switching between he's a lawyer, and he's a cop, and how I can't do this, and it's illegal and racism and how he'll talk to the owner and I'll be fired, blah, blah blah.\n\nI had to endure several more minutes of this before he switched tactics again. This time simply trying to force his way in. He lunged for the door, yanking on it with both hands while I held it shut with one. Now we're struggling with the door and I have to start turning patrons away, because I know he'll force his way in past them. This whole time he's screaming obscenities at me Repeating how \"You can't do this\" \"Don't even try\" \"I'm much stronger than you dude!\" \"I'm a bodybuilder!\" All while he's still yanking on the door with two hands, and I'm holding it shut with one.\n\nFinally he lets go, I move to completely block the door, covering the handle with my back and leaning my full weight against it. Foiled, he proceeds to get real close to my face and say \"I'm gonna kick your ass!\" to which I laugh and just say \"Do it. You'll go to jail.\" He's much smaller than me, so I don't know what he thinks he's going to do, but he starts slapping me upside the head. Not really hard, but annoying enough.\n\nAt this point I know what he's looking for, he wants me to hit him back so he can claim racism. Thankfully I had learned my lesson and hold back. He slaps me a couple times to which I just say \"Quit it\", to which he does not, so I lean in really close and whisper almost under my breath \"Do you have a facking death wish?\" While looking him dead in the eye.\n\nI must have spooked him because he backed down and ran back towards the parked car with the young lady inside. As he gets in another bouncer appears running down the sidewalk from a side entrance. The guys shifts it into gear and hightails it out of there before he can get to him, so the other bouncer approaches me and asks me what happened, as the patrons I had been turning away reported the altercation.\n\nHe leaves and my boss comes down to sit with me, I give him the full debrief and he says \"You know, you're not a punching bag, you don't have to take that.\" But I knew what he was after, and I wasn't going to give it to him.\n\nLater that night I finally catch up with the bartender and ask him why they had been barred from reentry and found out that after a heated exchange as to who should pay for drinks, both decided to walk out on the bill, knocking over several tables and other patrons in the process.",

Third patrol guy is no where to be seen so we start our exterior patrol and nothing seems amiss so we unlock and enter the building and start an interior patrol. We clearly communicate over the radio to dispatch we are entering the building. Half way through our interior patrol, the front door rattled loudly and scared the shit out of me and my supervisor. We attempted to radio the Third patrol and see if it was him. No response. My senses are heightened and at this point and I had my hand on my firearm. We quickly exit and start another exterior patrol to investigate. Sure enough it’s the Third patrol guy who we run into as soon as we exit. I was like fuck dude I almost shot you!

The alarm was cleared but I continued to bitch out Third patrol. \n\nHe admits he made a few “mistakes” \nA) Did not respond in an appropriate manor or he wouldn’t have been 5 minutes late to the call (you can get anywhere in 2 minutes if you respond in an emergency mode (speed, lights, siren) and know where your going (he didn’t recognize the address and instead of looking it up he drove around to try and find it)\nB) Did not communicate he was on scene “I didn’t think... I didn’t want your guys radio to que up loudly and give away your position” (we have earpieces so this doesn’t happen and who cares I’d rather have my radio go off and know I got a unit on scene)\nC) Turned down his radio “So it wouldn’t be loud” and initially “ forgot my radio in the car” (FUCK! Keep your radio on you)\nD) proceeded to check doors when no one knew where he was “I couldn’t find you so I thought if I just started checking doors I’d run into you” (I’m like dude this is how you get shot)\n\nI’m like you realize this is how you get shot!

Tonight a lady was playing at the arcade with her friend, then for some reason her friend went back to the first lady's car and was just sitting out their with a male subject.  Then all if a sudden, this lady realized that this male, who she doesn't know, is in her car.  She gets livid at her friend for allowing this strange man to get in her car.  She goes out and confronts her friend and the male.  Then guess who shows up???  Everyone's favorite character, Candy man.  He runs inside and says to me \"Security, hurry up and get out there they about to kill each other!\"  I can hear the screaming through the open door.  I RUN out there and yell \"HEY!\" while trying to pull the friend off the lady who owns the vehicle.  Me and the male subject get them separated, and the male subject says \"it's cool, we're leaving.\"    \n\n   \n\nSo I try to walk back inside, but somebody locked me out.  I'm freaking, thinking it was a set up and somebody is robbing the place.  But then one of the regulars let's me back in.  He had locked the door to keep people from coming in while I was dealing with the cat fight in the parking lot.  OK...    \n\n    \n\nThen I hear the two ladies start up again.  I decide, I don't want to leave my post again, so I get on the phone with PD.  Let them handle the cat fight this time, while I keep the store secured.  This upsets Candy man.  He yells \"What the fuck are you here for?\"  I reply that I'm here to protect the store and that I can't abandon my post to ref women's UFC.  He says something to the effect of \"yeah, right.\"  Whatever, I don't care if he believes me.  Then another guy walks up and says \"don't call the police, they're gone.\"  So I tell the dispatcher that the situation has resolved itself and I don't need police after all.  I need a new post.",

        "text": "I work in a bar in a small town area loaded with colleges, we're a small operation compared to some, but big for the area we serve. We like to have a nine person crew on to secure all the doors, with several floaters so backup is always a yell away. Unfortunately it doesn't always work like that.\n\nOur worst nights of the year are always New Years, Halloween, and the night two weeks before Halloween which is the annual Zombie Pub Crawl. My first year on I experienced all three, I had been employed there since May, so I wasn't prepared for what came next.\n\nWe were the start of the pub crawl, which began at six at our bar, then traveled to each bar in turn. Problem was on this particular night the Fire Marshal decided to do compliance checks for capacity. So we shut the door down while he was there, this riled up the already riled up patrons who proceeded with \"What do you mean if we leave we can't get back in?\" \"What do you mean the door is locked down?\" \"What do you mean you're at capacity?\" \"What If I go out for a smoke?\" sending us into looping responses as to the hows and the whys. \n\nFinally he leaves, but proceeds to hit every bar in town. At this point the crawl moves on, except none of the other bars have near our capacity, and he visits every single one. All those bars rigidly enforce their capacity, so we see wave after wave of patrons turn back because our bar was already done.\n\nAt this point we're crowded well beyond capacity because the owner wants to make up for when he shut the door down, security is stretched into a thin black line, and to top it off, we don't have enough radios because we never do, but that's another story. I'm pulled off a door to escort a patron out by an irate bartender, the bartender replaces me at the door and I approach the customer.\n\n\"My manager says it's time for you to go\" As a rule, I never identify who ordered it or why a patron is being kicked out. Some guys do, and that invites disputes, I've seen bartenders attacked over it because it didn't occur to security that the patron might be mad enough to do something stupid. So I get the inevitable \"Who said I have to go and why?\" And my answer is always \"My Manager\" and \"He didn't say\". He spouts some profanities and I say \"I'm just doing my job\" and he's like \"No, I get it. LEt me finish my drink\"\n\nWe stand there for a couple minutes, which is a couple more than I should have given him, but he was being relatively cooperative, so I let it go. After a couple minutes sipping his drink, he's standing there smirking thinking that he's outwitted me when I say \"You have to drink it faster than that\" and he replies \"I'll take my damn time on this expensive drink\"\n\nSo I take it from him, in retrospect it's not smart to snatch things out of people's hands, especially drunk ornery people but I was new and stupid. He starts to freak out and threaten me, I call for backup, which isn't heard. He begins to mock me, and I tell him it's time to go or the cops can drag him out. He dares me to, but by this time his friends are sufficiently freaked out and start to drag him towards the door.\n\nHe begins to make exaggerated attempts to fight his friends off and come at me, the way all posturing assholes do when they're confident their friends can keep them at bay. This is bad, we're in a narrow space with many other patrons who are in danger of being injured by this fool. So I did a second stupid thing that night, I laid hands on him.\n\nIt's the cardinal no-no of bouncing and I know it could have gone badly, but I grabbed him by the collar and swept him and his friends out the door while he was screaming assault and to get my hands off him. I get him out the door and finish with a don't come back, when he whirls around and bops me on the nose.\n\nAt that point, my job is done, and I know in my head that I should have let it go, but I was attacked, and I had the right to self defense, so I grabbed him. By this point bartender had realized I needed help, three on one wasn't good odds, and finally help arrived in the spindly form of a guy we'll call Jose.\n\nNow Jose wasn't exactly built for security, but he'd spent so long in the restaurant industry so he kinda just fell into it. As you can imagine, this didn't stop them at all. Jose tries to pry me and punchy apart, and I'm trying to tell him to secure the other two guys and we're all a heaving mass of confusion.\n\nBy this point the Bartender realizes a riot had broken out in the front door and runs to get the security manager. My manager was a giant among men, literally and figuratively, and all I see is his meaty fist grab punchy, and throw him like a rag doll into the wall. All fight left them, they just stopped, picked up punchy and limped off into the night with my boss shouting after them \"You're lucky you're not going to jail!\"\n\nAs the excitement dies down he asks me what happened, and why I didn't radio, I told him and said I tried repeatedly, that's when he realized he didn't even have one. He told me I shouldn't have laid hands on them, but he wasn't mad and he'd stand by me if the cops asked about it. Turns out the cops showed up later and he asked them about it, they knew nothing about it and didn't show much interest in pursuing it.\n\nMy boss ended up dying suddenly earlier this year and it cut our hearts out. We had gotten very close and he had mentored through a tough time in my life. I still think about him everyday.\n\nPart two is now up: https://redd.it/7dannu",

        "text": "This happened nearly 2 years ago whilst I was working unarmed security in a large UK supermarket.\n\nThe Background\n\nAs with most super markets nowadays we had self scan machines for shoppers to use by the front door. These are usually blindly operated looked after by at least 1 colleague. They are there to check the transactions and ensure the tills move along freely.\n\nRecently we'd had an update for the machines which was designed to pick up when a customer was weighing items as fruit/veg that were not fruit/veg. It would do so by recognising when people scanned more than 2 different weigh items in one transaction. It would then flash red for an attendant to come and check the items being scanned. They had been trailing this system in our store for a month or so before this story took place.\n\nThe Buildup\n\nIt was around 10-11:00hrs, before the lunchtime rush and some desk jockeys from head office were in store, unbeknownst to most staff, to test the new update to the self scan tills. \n\nOne of them was asking me about the new update and noted that we had not logged many stops on our internal security log using it. I explained that not all of our self scan operators use the radios and so don't tell us about any incidents as they happen so we can record them down and they don't let us know about something they suspect is happening at that moment. The guy acknologes this and then leaves to do whatever it is he needs to do. I continue on with my work.\n\nThe Blunder\n\nIts 13:00hrs and my supervisor gets called into the security office along with the checkout manager and the desk jockeys from head office. It seemed serious. I'm asked to cover the main door whilst he sees what it is about. I'm none the wiser and just carry on doing my thing.\n\nThe meeting was about a failed test purchase that happened in store. The desk jockeys were actually very high up security managers within the company (higher than regional manager) and part of their test of the new software on the self scans was for one of them to weigh 4 steaks as onions and bananas on the tills to see if the light went red for an operator to intervene to check if it all worked - which it did. He weighed the steaks and after the third, the light went red. The operator went over, flashed their barcode to verify the items and walked away. They didn't actually check the items or they would've seen an attempt to steal. The manager finished his scanning, paid and walked out of the store - a successful theft right under our noses!\n\nThe Battering\n\nThe meeting was tense between all the parties. The question was asked - why did this happen? The checkout manager was quick to point the finger at security (basically me) and defend his colleague. My supervisor retorted with the obvious (and correct) reply that it was his colleague who didn't do their job properly. They go back and forth with the same argument for a few minutes in front of the security managers. One of them even raises the point I had made about not everyone on self scan using radios and informing security of incidents. Even with all of this, it's not looking good for both security and the self scan operator. The competence of security is on the line.\n\nThe Bounce-back\n\nWhilst the meeting is going on, I am doing my thing and monitoring the CCTV cameras we have in store. I'm casually flicking through them all when I stop on the meat aisle. A lady with a trolley catches my eye and I zoom in to take a closer look. Something isn't right here. It doesn't take long - I see her rip off a number of sticky soft tags from multiple packets of meat and steaks - around £30-£40 worth.\n\nThe security office has all of the camera feeds up on the wall and it also has what I am looking at on CCTV on a separate monitor. As soon as the lady started detagging the steaks, my supervisor and everyone in that room saw what I saw.\n\nI radio through to my supervisor. He says he saw on the monitor and will come out to assist. We follow the lady on CCTV and sure enough, she conceals all the meat in a bag before she gets to the till. She pays for her cheaper items and heads towards the door. My supervisor and I make the stop and escort her to the holding room. I go back to the door and the security managers along with my supervisor issue the lady with a banning letter, recover the items and send her on her way.\n\nThe Backwash\n\nThe security managers left after having stern words with the checkout manager about their colleague failing to check the test purchase. I didn't get spoken to at all about it.\n\nI only found out afterwards from my supervisor that I'd saved the reputation of the stores security team and my supervisor by spotting the shoplifter when I did and in the professional manner in which it was handled. He thanked me profusely and I finished for the day. \nNot a bad days work I'd say.\n\nEdit: formatting",

False alarms occurred with startling regularity, which made this location a favorite of my company, since every alarm response was cash in our pocket. The alarm contractor made every effort to encourage the school not to upgrade, since the cumulative alarm response fees, usually several each and every night, ended up making more than they could selling and installing new equipment that worked.\n\nI mention this so that you can understand the sense of urgency I had towards the alarm. I approached the site with my complacency meter spiked, just wanting to get in and out of this site I had responded to at least a hundred times that year. In addition, the alarm was pinging at an outdoor location, out in the field house/concessions stand near the football field. You know, the one alarm that gets set off by things like *wind.* \n\nI was barely paying attention as I opened the gates and walked out into the pitch black of the athletic fields. When I reached the tiny structure that was the snack bar, my flashlight came up and saw the wooden door to the shack shattered, with a hatchet literally buried in and left in the middle of the door. After months of constant response to known false alarms, this was the first moment in far too long where my guardbrain came online, and my adrenaline and senses woke up. I shut off my light, wide-eyed, and was still, listening to my surroundings as the wind died down.\n\nThen I heard distant voices. Then the clang of metal against a security door. It was coming from under the huge hometeam bleachers.\n\nMy dispatch was Good People, so when I radioed \"suspects on my location, Roll PD, radio quiet\", he did exactly that as I started crossing the football field, trying to go low and silent, and doing a pisspoor job of it. Despite this, I ended up in front of these huge bleachers, and aware of 3 voices on the ground just to the side of where the metal seats ended. 3v1 is gonna be a Bad Time.\n\nI decided to approach from above, and started climbing the bleachers in the dark. I figured if I get rushed, at least I can fight from high ground? My mind was jumpy and making plans as I stopped at about 20 flights up and moved along the aisles so I could look over the side of the bleachers and onto the suspects below, whose continued noisemaking was probably the only reason my clumsy ass wasn't heard making the approach.\n\nI peeked over, and breathed easier. They couldn't have been more than 17yrolds. They were pounding on a metal door with a crowbar and apparently getting nowhere. They all wore black hoodies. No one had seen me, so I just watched and listened. Two of them were discussing just 'going home, calling it a night', while the third was ignoring them and wailing on the door with as much force as his skinny white frame could muster. The other two never showed their faces in my direction, but seemed dismissive of their accomplice. With a nod between them, they dropped their tools and started off across the football field where I had come from without saying anything to the little guy, who was still standing there pounding on the door.\n\nI looked back over my shoulder and caught a glimpse of the local PD approaching in thier SUVs. I had eagle eyes back then, and even with no lights or sirens, you could make out the patrol units over a city block away. It helped that at that hour, no one else was on the road.\n\nThe two bigger kids had almost dissapeared in the dark distance by this point, but the little one was still below me, cursing at the unyielding door. Then he looked up and said to no one in particular, \"Where the hell did those guys go?\"\n\nOh man! The moment was too fucking good! Still shaky from the rush, but as casually as I could, I leaned over the side and answered from above, \"They headed East, that way.\" Dude jumped like a spider had landed on him. \"You might wanna join 'em, I'd say you've goooot..\" \n\n*glance at radio* \n\n\"...about a minute and a half.\"\n\nHe stood there frozen staring up at me for a good 7-10 seconds. I smiled and waved, trying to act as non-chalant as possible. I wondered if he would ever snap out of it, but he did, dropping his tools and bolting across the field after his chums as though his life depended on it. The tension broken, I cackled loudly as he went, more from relief than anything. From this vantage spot I could see him, his friends, and the police. Through my dispatcher I was able to direct the PD to the directions they were fleeing, and I got a bird's eye of the short chase.\n\n15min later, with the three rounded up, I was sitting in one of the squad SUVs, being asked to identify who I saw. The little white kid I confirmed, but to the officers' annoyance, I wouldn't point the others out. I hadn't actually seen their faces, and the hoodies were long ditched. When the bigger hispanic and black kid were let go, while the little white kid got cuffed and hauled off, the surprise on their faces...\n\nA Police Captain soon arrived, to the further annoyance of the officers. His kids went to this school, and he was fired up. He had brought a whole squad of officers with him. It was time to check the school. What we found kept me on the site for several hours, well into the morning, and went from unbelieveable to ridiculous in short order.\n\nIt turns out I had arrived at the very end of an all-night spree. We found at least 15 break-ins on the school, doors bashed and equipment destroyed. A maintanance shed had opened to them and provided more tools to break other things with. Then, we found the school motor pool, a big chainlink enclosure which held the maintanance crew's golf cart fleet. Some were missing, of course, but then we noticed one of them was marked with....another High School's logo? One miles down the road?\n\nThe police let me tag along on the whole affair since I had the keys to all the buildings. By the time we hashed out the sequence of things, we discovered that this wasn't the only break-in site; the spree had originated at this other high school! After the kids had finished attacking what areas they could, they had stolen a golf cart from that site, and driven it to this one, where they continued the process. They also managed to drive this school's cart through a fence into a middle school's property next door, and broken in there as well. 3 properties had been hit.\n\nAnd all three properties had alarms from our response client. Of all the sensors and detectors that should have tripped (a couple of door sensors were even directly destroyed), *only the snack bar alarm had actually gone off.* For the entirety of the spree. After months of constant unending falses I was fucking livid, but hey, welcome to Security.\n\nI was especially lucky to have met an officer who was involved in the case on a later incident months after, so I actually got some follow up. The little white kid had flipped on his friends without much trouble. Upon arriving at the house of a second suspect, they confronted him in his backyard. His story of knowing nothing was complicated by the presence of a stolen high school golf cart sitting in said backyard. Beyond that, records are sealed (Juvies).\n\nIn that job, false alarms were the only thing you got, all day and all night. Having a real incident was super-rare. Getting the collar on suspects was unheard of. Of course, all I got for it was a ton of high-fives at the office and a sincere handshake from the owner, but hey, I'll take it.",

        "text": "Hello my brothers and sisters! Been a minute since I posted last. I feel obligated to divulge that I no longer work for the same zoo where my famous Gorilla incident happened, but I am still gainfully employed in a special event security firm. Mostly we deal with local events, but will go out of town for events too. That brings me to my story today.\n\nFor some background: one facility we monitor is a decently sized indoor stadium. 5 levels, 3 open to public, and plenty of resutrants and stores. This is one of the main venues in town for big events, so it tends to be \"the place to be\" during event times. My main duties entail patrol of the facility along with helping posted staff as needed. My patrols start 3 hours before the event and end about an hour after. \n\nOne night, during a home team NBA game, I'm walking towards the break room, when I'm approached by one of the directors of operations for the stadium. \n\nHe looks at me and says \"Are you busy?\". \n\nNot anymore, apparently. \n\nHe motions to a nearby bathroom, and states, \"There's a woman in a bathroom stall screaming at other patrons to get out.\"\n\nSimple enough, I've dealt with enough drunk patrons, and at least this one is in a bathroom while screaming. As I approach the women's side to block off entry, I start to reach for my radio to call for female backup (SHARP, hell of a policy), when the director reapproaches. \n\n\"She's actually in the men's bathroom.\"\n\nOh boy. \n\nI finish my backup call, advising dispatch that I was making contact. Apparently everyone was as bored as me, because before I could knock on the stall door, my supervisor (a women), my partner, and the other roaming group are all directly behind me. It occurs to me at this point that there are still men actively, ahem, answering nature's call. I motion for my female counterparts to step out while the male patrons finish up. Now, it's just me, the director, and Princess Drunk, who hasn't actually said anything (nothing coherent anyway) at all. I gingerly approach the stall door, under which I can see a set of black heels, and knock softly three times. \n\n\"Ma'am, it's security. You ok in there?\"\n\nShe slurs back, \"Yeah, I'm fine, I just need a minute.\"\n\n\"Ma'am, are you aware you're in the men's bathroom?\"\n\nI can hear the confusion in her voice when she replies, \"No, I'm in the women's.\"\n\nI should note she was oddly calm for someone as drunk as she is.\n\n\"No ma'am,  you're in the men's bathroom.\"\n\n\"Oh, well I'm sorry. I just need a minute, I promise I'll leave.\"\n\nShe seems docile, so I let her stay. I motion for a female guard to make more personal contact, while I and the director walk out to close off the bathroom temporarily. \n\nAfter about 5 minutes, out comes one of the saddest sights I've seen. A beautiful blonde woman, about early 20's, dressed as pretty as she can, comes stumbling out in tears, holding a beer in one hand, and holding onto my supervisor with another. It took me a moment, but.i then immediately recognized the girl. I had seen her walking in drunken circles around the stadium, and called it in to dispatch. I had wondered where she went. \n\nOnce she's clear of the bathroom, we reopen the entrance, and I start to listen in on her and my supervisors conversation. Although I came in a little late, this is what I heard. \n\nMy Super: \"So who are you here with tonight sweetheart?\"\n\nDrunk Girl: \"My boyfriend, but I don't know where he is.\"\n\nDamn. Well, there goes my dreams.\n\nS: \"Ok. Do you know where your seats are?\"\n\nDG: \"Ummm, yeah, I think I've got my *hic* ticket.\" \n\nShe proceeds to pull out a crumpled ticket, which my supervisor looks over.\n\nS: \"Sweetheart, your seats are on the other side, how'd you get over here?\"\n\nSupe, wtf? She's drunker than a Irishman with a lifetime supply of Guinness. She's not gonna be able to tell you. \n\nOr so I thought. She then proceeds to say the saddest thing I heard all night. \n\nDG: \"Well, I told my boyfriend I had *sniff* to go to the bathroom, so he walked me over here. I guess I thought *sniff* that the sides were different, so i walked in. I threw up a little, and next thing I know, I hear someone knocking on the door.\"\n\nS: \"So wait, your boyfriend went with you? Is here any where nearby?\"\n\nThe girl scans the clustertruck of people nearby, and nearly breaks down in tears when she says no. \n\nThis poor girl not only is embarrassed for drunkenly wandering into the wrong bathroom, but now her boo has abandoned her in a time off need.\n\nMy supervisor manages to calm her down, and gets an usher to walk her back to her seats. Naturally, this is when boyfriend returns. And by God, I recognize him too. He was one of the guys still in the bathroom when she was. AND HE JUST LEFT HER. \n\nThe night chugs on rather uneventfully, but I'm pretty sure it didn't end well for them, because as I saw them leave after the game, she looked sober and pissed. \n\nMoral of the story: Don't be the asshole that leaves your girl in the wrong bathroom. Security will secretly hate you.\n\nEDIT: Formatting",

        "text": "A little background information. I work as a (usually) overnight security guard for a large bank's data centers. I'm considered an employee of said bank even though we're a third-party security company.\n\nNow, onto the two tales I have for you today:\n\n**Tale 1: Ms. Audi**\n\nOne of my first days (a Friday) working at the data center, I was working the morning shift when my partner noticed an employee's car parked in one of the 2-hour parking spots usually used by our contractors. He pulled up the big book of tickets and saw that this lady had 6 prior tickets for parking in visitor parking and parking in the fire lanes. He wrote up a ticket and told our shift supervisor as he was going out to put it on her windshield.\n\nThe shift supervisor went a few offices down and notified the client. Next thing I know, said client bursts into the security office and nearly yells \"Get the towing company on the phone, now!\" Needless to say, her car was on the flatbed within 20 minutes.\n\nThe rest I heard the next day when I came in for my next shift. The woman came up to the security desk, absolutely furious. The shift supervisor gave her a shit-eating grin as he handed her the paper with the tow company's information on it. She went ballistic, saying \"What am I supposed to do now?!\" and \"I'm gonna get a rental car and [Bank Name] is gonna pay for both it and the impound fees!\" The shift supervisor told her \"Ma'am, you can try but we can't say if the company'll pay for it.\"\n\n**Tale 2: Mr. ACL**\n\nA couple days later, I was picking up an extra shift since someone called out. My partner was flipping through the camera feeds and happened upon a car parked in the fire lane. Standard procedure, take down the plate number and state, then go out and fill out the rest. The employee was notified that he'd have to move his car or we'd tow it. Not even 10 minutes later, we get a call from our satellite security desk. It's the car owner (CO), and he goes off on our shift supervisor (SS):\n\nCO: \"I just had ACL surgery, do you know how that feels?\"\n\nSS: \"Yes, I do. I had it a couple years ago.\"\n\nCO: \"Then you know how bad it hurts. I can't handle stairs!\" (All of our parking garages have elevators)\n\nSS: \"I'm sorry, but you need to move your car.\"\n\nCO: \"Fine, but remember. I pay your salary!\"\n\nWe watched him get to his car with no crutches, no limp, nothing to to show he was in any kind of pain. He gets into his car, then opens the door again only to rip the ticket off his windshield and throw it on the ground. After he'd pulled away, my partner went to retrieve it and then we got to watch and laugh for about 20 minutes as we watched him circle the parking lots.",

School has let out for the day and I'm on patrol supervising student pick-up. I run into one of the teachers I usually shoot the breeze with. While were talking about our Holloween plans, I hear someone yelling. Outside the school a woman is yelling at two boys who aren't wearing coats and cussing out a teacher over the school's dismissal policy. I walk up and ask the woman what her problem is and she says, \" Those boys aren't wearing their coats and this bitch says they can't go back in the school!\" The teacher and myself try to explain that students are responsible for collecting their belongings before exiting the building but she wouldn't hear of it. Finally I tell her if she's worried about her kids being out in the cold she should put them in her car with the heat on. She Then floors me by saying \"Those ain't my kids.\" Yeah this woman literally just made a scene over kids that aren't even hers. I come to find out later that neither of the two boys knew who she was and one of the boys came to school in the hoodie he was wearing.\n\nTL:TR: Nutty woman makes a scene because boys she didn't know wern't wearing coats in 60% weather.",

Sure enough we find the truck and confront the driver who says he doesn’t know how all mud got on the side of the truck and wheel well of the trailer.

They make a scene for about 5 minutes and gather up their people, in total almost 30 customers ended up leaving because i kicked these two guys out. \n\nBut onto the move. One of their little goons stuck around and i was in the smoking area of our bar. (We have a gated smoking patio that is outside, right next to the main entrance, with a gate that can open to remove people, and act as a fire exit) so the exit gate is about 10 feet from the main door, and the check in machine we use for ID is in between the gate and the door. 2 guys on door this night, and 2 guys inside. \n\nSo this relatively short stocky guy is a friend of the guys i just removed. And he is starting to yell at me and wants to fight me. I turn around not knowing who he is yelling at, and he points to me and says yeah you. So i ask him if he is absolutely sure that he wants to fight. He says yes, and i tell him to come outside with me and we'll fight.\n\nSo i open up the smoking area gate, and he follows me outside. I take a couple steps away from him towards the main door. And my door guy closes the gate behind him. I now have my entire team out on the front door with me.

        "text": "TLDR at the bottom.\n\n**Psych Holds 101**\n\nFor those of you who don't know, a psychiatric or medical detention order is a doctor's writ that declares someone a potential danger to themselves or others. It gives the hospital immediate, semi-complete medical custody over the patient. This means we may use as much force as necessary to detain that person should they attempt to leave, and may forcibly administer medications that are relevant to treating an existing *medical* condition.\n\nMost people don't know what a psych hold is or that an ER doctor can place one. So when you tell them that they're *not permitted to leave,* they'll usually react negatively. They sling accusations of false imprisonment, sometimes physical or legal threats, and several other intimidation tactics. This behavior may be compounded by the psychiatric issue they've been placed on a hold for.\n\nIf they escape, we notify police. Local police hunt them down and bring them back, one way or another.\n\n-----\n\n**Part I: The Notification**\n\nA man checks into the ER for a medical issue. Don't ask who, I can't tell you. Let's say his name is Steve and that he's 28 years old.\n\nDuring his assessment, Steve must have made some statements that made the doctor think it's unsafe to let him leave, so the doctor places a hold. They hadn't notified him yet, but they alert security all the same. So I'm hanging out near his room when they tell him, and as expected, he's already not taking it well. \"This is bullshit,\" \"I want to call my lawyer,\" etc.\n\nNow, it's not my business to know why someone's on a hold. It's my business to confirm they're on a hold, ensure safety, and detain as necessary. I was told he walked into the lobby like he owned the place, brazenly demanding to skip the queue. But I wasn't there, so I don't know. I can only confirm what I know.\n\nSo, this guy is not happy. When Steve starts escalating, the nurse disengages and asks us to step in. I do so, and listen to him talk about how we're infringing on his rights. Before I've even said a word, he starts gathering his things as if he's about to go.\n\nI calmly tell him again that I would lose my job if I allowed him to leave, and I try to explain how a hold works (\"doesn't mean you're crazy for sure, just that we need a specialist to evaluate you. plead your case to them, etc.\"), but people don't think clearly when they're enraged. He's ignoring me, still getting ready to leave. So I disengage and step out, close the door, and hold it closed with my boot. I send out a \"send additional\" in 10-code to avoid spooking Steve further.\n\n-----\n\n**Part II: The Queen's Guard**\n\nSecurity at our hospital cannot make the call to apply restraints. It must be ordered by the doctor or nurse, and the nurse said no in this case despite quite obvious flight risk. At this point, I have no choice but to stand by and wait for the situation to deteriorate. I don't like it, because he is extremely agitated, paranoid, aggressive, and shouting to himself as he gathers his things.\n\nHe tries to open the door, bag of clothes in hand. I don't budge, my foot staying secure against it on the track. He tries tugging again. \"OPEN THIS FUCKING DOOR!\" At this point, I look away, stone faced, staring at the granite tabletop of the nursing station and studying it intensely. \"LET ME GO, THIS IS FALSE ARREST!\" He's yanking hard, but the door doesn't budge.\n\nAfter a minute of this, he huffs, walks away, then switches tactics. He puts his face to the window, inches away from the side of mine, and he begins threatening me with his lawyers. He tells me I won't even be able to find a job in fast food, that I'll be fired by tomorrow, that I'll be in jail for false imprisonment. I'm sure I don't need to tell you security/police folks that this \"oh I'm so scary that I'll ruin your life\" bullshit is the bread and butter for anyone who is detained for anything, whether that detention is legal or not.\n\nStill, I don't even flinch. I keep staring at that granite countertop, zoning out yet fully alert like a Royal Guard at Buckingham Palace. I watch Steve out of my peripheral vision. An EMT down the hall later told me he had to try not to laugh because of how absolutely stone cold I looked as someone screamed at me at the top of their lungs, inches away, not reacting at all.\n\nJust doing my job.\n\n-----\n\n**Part III: Verbal IMDB and Dickwaving**\n\nStrangely, he starts listing the names of movies, TV shows, and other shit. I think this is just part of his mental issues. \"RING ANY BELLS, YOU LITTLE SHIT?\" he shouted. I'm a bit of a square, so I don't follow TV, celebrity news, sports, etc. I play video games, that's the long and short of my media interest. But I've heard some of the names of the things he was saying. He names about thirty some-odd publications. He demands my name so he can tweet it out.\n\nHe tells me, \"You have no idea who you're fucking with.\"\n\nYou hear this a lot, too. You learn to ignore it. A lot of psych patients think they're federal agents or [Any US President]'s spies or whatever. Or they think they're assassins, or top shit,  or they want you to think they're gangsta. They want a reaction.\n\nMy partner arrives now, and I wave him off to go talk to the nurse. I don't like doing briefings on patient behavior in front of the patient, but I can't leave. Steve, understanding that I'm not going to budge, finally goes to the back of his room, crossing his arms and brooding as he stares daggers at us, muttering random shit at me. As I stare at the counter and watch Steve out of the corner of my eye, I listen to the faint, hushed conversation at the other end of the nursing station. Now, and only now, does the nurse think this raving jerk needs to be in soft restraints. Fucking finally.\n\n-----\n\n**Part IV: Shot Down**\n\nMy partner and the RN start making their way back to me, my partner radioing the restraint activation code. The RN gathers a few techs to help us out. At this, I finally break out of my trance and move to the door and open it, ready to drop the news on Steve; the restraints need to go on, and they come off faster if you comply.\n\nBefore I can say a word, he screams at me again.\n\n\"YOU CAN'T DO THIS TO ME! I HAVE [fairly high number] TWITTER FOLLOWERS!\"\n\n[\"I don't care,\" I say calmly](https://ladygilraen.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/game-of-thrones-1x08-the-pointy-end-tywin-lannister-cap.png).\n\nHe flinched as if the words physically struck him. \"You don't... you don't *care?!*\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nI wish I could adequately describe the look on his face. It was the sight of a man completely helpless and lost. His entire existence had just been brought into question. At first he winced, then his eyes clenched shut. He clutched his head and pulled on his hair almost hard enough to pull it out, let out a roar of frustration and... strangely, anguish. To my surprise, he threw himself into the bed face down and began to cry.\n\nI almost felt bad for the guy.\n\nAlmost.\n\nCall me a monster if you want, but I had to try really hard not to laugh.\n\nHis ego was deflated like a popped balloon. He didn't even fight it when we brought in the soft restraints and applied them. I politely asked him to roll over, he did, and we restrained him.\n\n-----\n\n**Part V: So, was he actually famous?**\n\nDuring debriefing, I joked about how we've got another [name of imaginarily famous patient]. The nurse smirked and said, \"He's telling the truth.\"\n\nI frowned. \"What?\" My partner said he saw him on [name of show] and asked me if I'd ever seen it. Nope. I pulled his chart, retrieved his ID numbers for my restraint report, and tried to remember if I'd seen the name before. Later, I googled him.\n\nSure as shit, 30+ publications on IMDB. Nothing immensely *major,* nothing truly big time, but he was definitely known. I was a little gobsmacked. Like I said, most of the time when people pretend to be famous it's just bullshit to try and intimidate you.\n\nSteve ultimately got evaluated by a psych doctor within a couple of hours and cleared to leave on his own. Pretty short hold, all things considered. We removed the restraints, and he and I had a chat. He was civil, actually... or as civil as someone can be when they think so highly of themselves.\n\nHe apologized for his behavior and said he was just desperate to get to a meeting. I told him I know being on a hold sucks, so I took no offense. I explained that I don't watch TV at all, which is why I didn't recognize him. Sad to say, but that actually made him cheer up a little bit. He's got a huge ego, that's for sure.\n\n-----\n\n**Bonus Chapter: What to do if you're on a psych hold.**\n\nPsych holds really do suck. If you say the wrong thing to a doctor, you're trapped. It's like being locked in your home bathroom and told you can't leave for several days, and strangers peek in on you constantly until it's over. There's no peer review; *habeas corpus* will take around two days to process and incurs cost. By then, you may have already been evaluated. The police can't help you, either. Their response will be \"I'm not qualified to challenge medical experts. I defer to the doctor's order.\"\n\nObviously, this situation would make anyone extremely uncomfortable. Worse still, any show of frustration simply confirms the belief among staff that you're unstable. The best thing to do is remain calm when you're informed you're on a hold, and I'm not just saying that for my benefit as a security officer. That's to your benefit too.\n\nWhy?\n\nWell, the evaluator is sometimes a third party from another facility. They often come into every situation fresh. So, be respectful and honest to the psych evaluator when they arrive. When you answer their questions, avoid rambling, don't lie, don't argue, and don't elaborate unless they ask you to. And don't assume they won't talk to the staff about your behavior during your stay, because they absolutely always will.\n\nI told Steve I deal with people on their worst days and in their worst moments. If I judged everyone harshly based on that, it'd hurt me more than anyone else. And yes, the system sucks, but it's what we've got. \"It's not personal,\" I said. \"If Tom Cruise came in here on a psych hold, I'd still do my job.\" We shared a laugh over that.\n\nOf course, it's best to avoid being on a hold in the first place. Don't indicate suicidal or homicidal thoughts just because you think it might lend more urgency to your medical issue. If you *are* having these thoughts and genuinely want help for it, then please be honest, and don't be afraid. They don't want to lock you away forever; these facilities genuinely want to help you, and they value their facility space because it's a hot commodity. You'll be out in no time.\n\nStay safe out there, folks.\n\n**TL;DR: Guy on psych hold claims to be famous. Actually is. Throws a tantrum. Breaks down crying when I tell him I don't care who he is.**\n\n**Reiteration: I will not disclose this man's name. Don't PM me.**",

Suddenly I notice a few of my FoH girls watching them too, so I ask are they ok, one of them replies she overheard them asking people to get them cigarettes. \n\nContinue to watch said punks, including sparking a damn lighter in my bakery aisle, and they know we're watching because they start getting lippy, and one of them goes \"oh shit, now the security guards watching\" in that obnoxiously loud voice that all customers use when they WANT us to hear them.\n\n\"Just doing my job\" I say in my own obnoxiously loud want-them-to-hear voice. Punk 1 laughs, and joins a third outside, Punk 2 is entirely a different story.\n\nHe protests innocence, demands to know what it is I \"think\" they've done, asserts that they came in to buy cookies but they were too hard, etc etc etc, refuses to leave, so I ask nicely, refuses to leave, I tell him to beat it, he decides to get lippy again, and starts throwing his shoulder my way. \n\nI f*cking HATE that!\n\nNow, in Scotland, there used to be a joke that when you were lifted by bouncers in clubs, you were \"oaxtered\" from the premises. (Your oaxter is your underarm) so the bouncers would be on either side of you, insert their hands into your armpits, and lift you up onto your tiptoes while simultaneously walking you out the door. It's crude, but effective, because it basically immobilises the arms so they can't take a swing at you, and have no choice but to walk\\glide in the direction you aim. This little shit decided to put up a fight though, starts struggling etc, and as soon as he's out the door, I step back. The on duty manager then comes out and he starts arguing that i assaulted him, that I'm a specky fat bastard etc etc, the usual, starts hurling insukts directed at me, at the manager, and so on, dares us to call the police.\n\nWhich we do.\n\nSuddenly he changes his tune, sits quietly outside the door, claiming he's waiting for the police to have me arrested because I assaulted him etc etc. Then 5 mins before they arrived, he and his friends disappear into the night.....\n\n\nSometimes you just gotta shake her head and ask \"WHATS THE POINT?!\" ",

It's not out of my typical venues, so rules are slightly relaxed, our assholes not as clenched. \n\nThree goddamn weekends of this nonsense, and of course the alcoholics are out in full swing.

As soon as I take my seat, he stirs and covers his wrist... because he knows why I'm there. \n\nStarts making excuses, 'I was posing for a picture', etc. His buddy is holding a beer and no camera. Cool,  strike one. After fighting with him for twenty minutes or so, I get his band and give him the no service. Awesome, strike two for competition. Then, as I return to post, I catch his friend passing off his beer after he ***just saw me cut his friend off.*** Strike three. \n\nAt that point, it's ejection time. On our way out, he claims to know why I targeted him, calls me sweety and shit, even goes so far as to say 'if I looked like that, I'd be jealous too'. \n\nBoi, you're insulting me, the cripple, who's walking your deluded ass out of the gate.

The door is the kind of door where the top and bottom half open separately, so I can see outside into the lobby from my office. \n\nA man stumbles in, and our fast laners direct him to me. He stops half way to me to look at our directory board. He approaches, and he informs me that he has an appointment with the ladies on the 20th floor about a small business loan for a million dollars. I ask him who, specifically, he is here to see. He just keeps repeating \"20th floor\". The 20th floor is not financial. No loans are given out on 20. He insists. I ask for his ID, and tell him ill call up. He tells me he doesn't have ID, but gives me a name. So I call up for Mr. John Does appointment, and the ladies on 20 are just as confused as I am. I hang up and inform him that he is not allowed up. He strolls back to the board, stares for a moment, comes back and tells me \"Oh, actually its floor 6\". I already know this guy is full of shit. Even more so that our board is completely outdated, and floor 6 is not what he thinks it is. I tell him he needs to leave. Instead of leaving, he steps back and tells me he will call his bank contact. I tell him that he is absolutely allowed to do that, and that would help us greatly. He makes a \"phone call\" while he stands in front of the board again. Clearly a fake call. He comes back over, and says \"I just got off the phone with your CEO. He says to just go ahead and tell you to send me up. I just talked to him, so you don't have to call up.\" \n\nEvery appointment that goes there is specifically sent to us in a memo by our CEOs secretary. She is very good about keeping on track of who does and who doesn't belong up there at any given time. Im already suspicious, but now this is becoming an escalating situation. \n\nI inform him that he, under no circumstances, can go up, and that he should know by name, our CEOs secretary. Call her and have her call me.\n\nHe tells me he talked to our CEO and not his secretary. I told him to have him have her call me or leave the building immediately. At this point, I have our rover, and our fastlaners on high alert. Theyre ready to escort him if needed. He tells us we are garbage security and that hes calling our boss. He walks off through the fastlanes, and darts to an elevator. We already knew this was going to happen. The rover puts his foot in the door, stopping it from closing while I bring the code blue keys over and the police are contacted. He slumps to the ground and starts crying about how we are all mean, and assholes. Hes gonna have our jobs. He owns x% of our banks stock, his own construction company, and is the top donator to the presidential campaign. We are all going to jail.\n\nWe were shaking in our boots. Any day now. . . Any day. . .\n\nIts been 3 months.\n\nTL;DR Man wants a small loan of a million dollars. Keeps giving me floor numbers he thinks are our loan departments, but doesn't realize our directory board is wrong.

I'm trying to battle complacency at my site, but I'm getting pushback from the higher ups at the client site.  I'm not asking them to do anything difficult, but they seem to have a problem with it.  One major part of my job is to check the i.d. of anyone looking to enter the client property, and to scan an electronic tag of the people that work for the client.  I have been trying to get everyone at the client company to show me their client company i.d., and not just hold out their tag for me to scan.  I feel it is important to be able for any officer to easily see their picture and name on the i.d. to compare the name that comes up on the scanner.  The client higer ups feel that since I know who they are, i shouldn't have to actually see their i.d., and just scan the tag and be done with it.  But the fact that I know them, to me, shouldn't matter.  I am supposed to check that any person entering the client site has a valid i.d., either their drivers licence or the client company i.d. badge, before allowing access.  I want to bring it up with my security company, but I'm afraid it will go one of two ways.  1.  They won't do anything, as they are too scared they might lose the contract, especially as there are so many companies out there, it's easy to believe there is one willing to do it cheaper.  Or 2.  They talk to the client about it, and the client asks to have me removed from the site to get rid of the problem, and my company acquiesces as they are too afraid to lose the contract for same reasons stated before.  I don't want my job to be in jeopardy,  but I'm trying to do my job. I don't know what to do, especially as I have seen #2 happen before",

We turn and see this dude who does not look like he is happy. He is throwing objects all over as he walks on the sidewalk. I call for a camera to watch this guy, as well as my supervisor.\n\nSupervisor shows up, and crazy guy notices us. Next thing you know, he is telling us how he has a knife and he's going to kill us and our families. Supervisor tells us to ignore it because \"there's no way that this guy is serious.\" He then tells us to go back to what we were doing before, and leaves.\n\nMe any my partner continue to watch this guy because we don't want him doing anything or hurting anyone. He starts yelling at random people, and then throws random objects at the building. Supervisor is called again, and I get a talking to about \"respecting his authority and not doing what he said.\" Whatever.\n\nNext thing I know, he's off state property across the street, waving his knife around giving us threats again. I ask if we should call PD to my supervisor. \"Nah, hes not serious.\" I proceed to disengage one of the locks on my holster, and just hold my hand on my sidearm. Supervisor goes \"That's brandishing in this state. Wrong move.\"\n\nWe wait 15 mins before the guy says \"I'll just shoot you guys. Make things simple.\" THEN Supervisor calls the cops.\n\n10 mins later, the guy is chilling on a bench. PD rolls up asking what the \"disturbance\" is. I explain what's going on to the officers. The driver goes \"So what, that's freedom of speech. You guys think because you have a gun and badge, that you're the police?\" Cop 2 then goes \"Relax. We'll go talk to him.\"\n\nRight after that, crazy guy just takes off running. 30 seconds later, about 10 cop cars show up, dude gets tazed, and arrested. Turns out he had felony warrants, meth, a 9mm pistol, and a knife.\n\n\nThe next day, I get paperwork, threatened to get fired, and restricted to dispatcher duty for \"unnecessary use of force and disobeying a supervisor.\"\n",

        "text": "Obligatory sorry for the long post, there is a TL;DR at the end. Didn't realize how much i was writing until i finished. Also first post here. As this seems to be the most active security sub i am in, the bouncer ones are nearly all over a year old now. \n\nSo I have been a bouncer for just about a year now at a bar in my area that does a hip-hop type \"club\" on the weekends. Pretty typical crowd, mix of younger people, bro dudes, hip-hop guys, and young ladies. This happened in the month of october on a rainy night. \n\nSo we had a total of 7 regular bouncers, and 1 head of security. Amazing team of guys, we all worked very well together. With a team of 7, we had one bouncer assigned for one of 5 zones that would rotate inside, 2 guys on the door for ID checks and wristbands, and the head of security who would float around freely between all zones and the door. \n\nThe max occupancy of this bar is about 400 people when the dance floor is set up. This wasn't an at capacity night, but pretty close at about 250-300 count at the end of the night. (We only do a running count of all people that have checked in, we don't adjust for people leaving throughout the night)  \n\nAnyway onto the meat of the story. We had all noticed a distinct tension in the air nearing the end of the night, the last 30 minutes before last call are always the prime time for something to happen. And we could all tell from the body language on the dance floor that something was definitely brewing. \n\nMostly people dance, hang out at the tables and chit chat, and between songs you can hear a roar of various conversations taking place. This was not the case tonight, we had multiple groups of 4-6 guys kinda huddled together and not moving at all, eyeballing, squaring up, and otherwise making gestures towards other individuals. Between songs was nearly dead quiet.\n\nWe got a call on our radios (we were all mic'd up) to post around the dance floor. Not 4 seconds after i took a back up post near the corner of the bar facing the dance floor, did a girl sitting at the bar pick up an empty glass and smash it directly into the face of another female sitting next to her. (In the UK i've heard this called \"glassing\" and am a fan of that term, but i'm in the usa)\n\nIt was on, i'm calling out my zone number and 2 more bouncers and on with me pulling apart these females, one has some pretty bad cuts on her face and is bleeding, the other is just going to town on the bleeding one by wrapping her hair around her off hand and wailing on/scratching her face with the other. \n\nNo sooner than we pulled them apart and got one out the door than those groups of guys from earlier decided to pop off, i'm talking about just shy of 30 people all just in a melee of bottles, glasses, chairs, bar stools all beating the ever loving hell out of one another.\n\nOur total of 8 bouncers break off in pairs and are just grabbing people left and right and damn near literally throwing them out of the doors. Our door guys are preventing people from coming back in. It was just absolute chaos. \n\nNearly any time we threw one guy out, 2-3 others would run out after them to continue the fight in the parking lot. So only after physically removing 10 people all of the fighters were outside to continue the brawl. Hardly anyone, fighter or not were inside anymore. Everyone had poured outside to either continue fighting or simply to watch.\n\nAll bouncer staff, as well as our barback, and both owners of the bar were posted by the door and our owners were \"quarter-backing\" and making a split second decision to pair us up in 3's and go into the parking lot to break up the groups ganging up on people.\n\nKeep in mind that it was raining this night, and there were about 5 groups of 3-4 guys ganging up on one person. So into the fray we went in our group of 3. This was also the night i discovered my \"bouncer voice\" one of my guys was behind me and we needed to get past a huge group of onlookers, he told me to yell at them to move, and with just a guttural, booming, projecting voice i yelled \"MOVE!\" and these people parted like the red sea. It was beautiful.\n\nSo the first fight group we got to, had knocked out a guy on the ground and were in the process of stomping his head and kicking his ribs, we rushed each fighter and pretty much just tackled/hockey checked each one away from the unconscious guy on the ground. They started to run away after some solid hits from us. And we went to assist the unconscious guy. We had barely picked him up when he came to and was only seeing red, he swung on us and was trying to push past us to pursue his attackers. His friends came and got him and put him in their car and were trying to leave.\n\nOnto the next group, 3v3 guys just swinging and kicking each other, jump between them and shove them away. Regroup with my team of bouncers. Wash rinse repeat around the parking lot for what seemed like an eternity but was probably only 5 or 6 minutes.\n\nWe all regrouped at the door, after being called back to the door over the radio. Hold the door for the next 15 minutes. Absolutely no one allowed back inside, fighter or not. Anyone still inside being kicked out. \n\nWorst fight i had seen since i started, and worst fight since i've been working there. All in all we banned just shy of 30 people that night.\n\nTl;DR 30-40 person melee at a hip hop bar on a rainy night, 8 bouncers responding. And a girl getting glassed. ",

        "text": "* Due to my admittedly limited OpSec, I typically don't share many stories of my experiences within the industry. Having said that, the following tale(s) of fail hark back to a period when a local hub for sporting events and performance arts was a post included within a client contract. Years have passed, and I highly doubt any of my contemporaries from said post will ever read this and connect the dots. Additionally, a shoutout to u/rekaepa for inspiring me to share; check out [his story of interrupted debauchery here](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromsecurity/comments/71pwvf/it_finally_happened/).\n\nThis event hub where I was posted served as a nexus for a wide variety of activity 24/7, 365 days a year. We would see a multitude of different shows, expos, and business, and as Facility Security, my fellow officers and I were tasked with both general safety of people and property as well serving as a turnkey. We would often be the first to unlock various portions of the facility for staff to prepare, or for our guests to set up shop for whatever they were doing. Between the very task-happy series of everyday business, we would squeeze in patrols and drive out ne'er-do-wells  ranging between skateboarders, homeless, and all the miscreants in between. This was no easy feat when you are alone/unarmed/lacking POST certification, and have to cover not only the primary arena building (which shares a pair of exhibition halls, a long galleria, an administrative hallway with meeting rooms, and a modular ballroom that can be divided into separate rooms as needed), but also a pair of theater buildings (one large, primarily for musical performances, and one small). These three structures then share a common walkway in between, where Facility Security has limited authority to enforce rules, varying by the nature of events in the area. This will become relevant in a moment, because tonight's \"tale(s) of fail\" include some interaction by a neighboring property's guard contingent - chief among them being a man who (if memory serves me correctly) served as his unit's site supervisor.\n\nEstimated 10 years my senior, and having a background in County Corrections, he was interesting to talk to in the middle of a graveyard shift. I found him to be very willing to impart his own experience and wisdom, but also a little bigoted. Not sure if the industry and work for County had left him jaded, or if he was close-minded as a result of religion; to be quite honest, I would chalk it up to a little bit of both. For the sake of future identification, let's just call him \"Marv\". Marv did his job well, but I was wary of him stepping on my team's toes if he saw something going on in our side of the property lines.\n\nWith that lengthy set-up, let's all take a trip down the course of memory lane.\n\n**Case #1**\n\nMultiple events had just finished up over the course of the weekend, and I was working overnight. I had already seen a variety of theater events wrap up for the night, with stage crews packing up and patrons vacating to enjoy the subsequent night-life of the area. Ergo, it was fairly dark and generally quiet as many flocked to the bars and clubs. As I made my patrol rounds and took opportunities to lock a variety of doors as they presented themselves, I noticed some activity near the central courtyard between the three structures. Visible from (and bordering) the neighboring property, were a drained empty fountain and some shrubbery. Attempting to shield themselves from general view using the foliage, were a couple looking to get frisky. As I saw them from a distance, I get a call on my post's duty cell; it's Marv, who I provided the number to in case of events or emergencies spilling from one property to another.\n\nMarv had, no doubt, heard some commotion during his own patrols and figured I had a pair of love birds on my property. As was his way, he felt that I should notify law enforcement. Having already spotted the source, I told Marv I was already working on diffusing the situation. I thanked him, then silenced the phone for a moment before approaching this couple.\n\nAs I walked up, the couple composed themselves; they had heard me approach, as I made no effort to hide my presence and had no desire to spook them any more than I already had. Not wanting to deal with any of the paperwork involved with bringing in law enforcement, I chose to take a more diplomatic approach. I cautioned them of the presence of other guards from neighboring properties, and the risk of being cited for public indecency, before revealing that I honestly had no desire to see them getting in trouble for something that wasn't really hurting anyone else. \"Make love, not war,\" as the saying goes. They weren't defacing property, or doing anything that posed a significant threat to safety, so I told them they should probably find a hotel or some place private. The couple appreciated my tact, and after some small talk went about looking for a more suitable location to resume love-making.\n\nAfter that was over, I saw Marv and related to him what I had found. I mentioned what the couple had told me during our small talk (they had seen one of the theater events earlier in the evening, and the lady of the pair had gotten in the mood after a drink or two), and that I chose to handle the situation with discretion. Marv felt that, if it had been him, he would have called Law Enforcement; he raised a valid concern that the couple may have been armed or sought to attack me in a drunken stupor. I responded to this with utmost honesty: firstly, that I had already found enough issues to document multiple issues over the weekend - my incident reports over the course of a twelve hour shift outnumbered my Sergeant's and Corporal's own reports (who saw a 40 hour work week each, Monday through Friday) - so I really did not want to add a visit from the City's Finest to that tally; and second, nothing I could see from the couple indicated any threat present. If either of them *had* drawn a weapon or chosen to get hostile, I could have withdrawn to cover and safety with ease.\n\nMarv and I agreed to disagree, and went on our respective ways. I would see the couple again about an hour and a half later, still looking for a place of seclusion.\n\n**Case #2**\n\nMarv and I had another run-in months later, when I was rotated to day shift over the weekends to accommodate the medical needs of another officer. Flipping from eight hour nights on Tuesdays and Thursdays to twelve hour day shifts on the weekends, I was not pleased to also be the continual target of resentment from the Corporal and Sergeant. They didn't have my back, and I continuously found myself documenting cases of vandalism and maintenance concerns that those two had ignored previously in the week - making them look bad because my reports often numbered double or triple anything those two would produce. As it stood, I stopped to talk with Marv during an afternoon patrol and voiced my discontent with the situation at large. It was approaching sunset, iirc.\n\nFacing Marv and his property, I don't see what he sees as he faces that fountain in the courtyard I mentioned earlier. As such, he asks if I saw the trio of young people (two females, one male) sitting on/around a bench with their dog. Visually, they were somewhere in between a couple of overweight college-aged kids and a group of transients. My speculation was that they were poor and living on welfare of some sort, so they weren't keen on washing their clothes all too often. As it stood, they had a small breed dog, possibly a chihuahua mix.\n\nMarv claimed to have seen one of the ladies pop down behind some of the newly planted flowers behind the bench, and relieve herself of some bodily excrement. I hadn't seen anything, myself, and could not find any definitive evidence outside of a wet spot on the cement. The mix of odors from the environment, unwashed bodies, and the dog meant I could not establish conclusive evidence of wrong-doing.\n\nUpsetting the male of the group while I was playing the role of Inquisition, I took him to the side and worked to deescalate a volatile scenario. While I did, I asked Marv to take a few steps back and let me handle things my way. I did my best to make things clear that I would have to politely ask the trio to leave. My justification was that I had a case of three people on the streets and their word against that of a licensed security guard. Having not seen the issue occur myself, as I was facing the other way, I could not verify either way who was telling the truth or who was exaggerating. I also did not want to see any fallout from Marv reporting any of the occurrence to my supervision; as I detailed earlier, I was not on good terms with my Sergeant and Corporal. For their safety and that of my own professional career, I informed them that it would be better if they left and returned at a later time. This left the male of the trio absolutely livid; I can't blame him, really, for feeling as if he and his lady friends were being falsely persecuted. He wanted none of my reasoning or explanation, as such, and felt I was overstepping my bounds. They eventually left, but I do recall the guy returning a week or so later - still bitter with me, and equating me to some kind of fascist. I also don't recall whether or not I documented any of this in an Incident Report or not, as it happened so long ago.\n\n* **TL:DR from my own perspective**; two public indecency cases and how \"Marv\" could make things turn sour.",

        "text": "So, I'm one of those event staffing folk that you typically find at a sporting event at your local sporting stadium. Nothing special, we manage line flow, root around inside your belongings and enforce the policies that leagues require (NFL/MLS/etc). One of the biggest, and most annoying policies that we deal with at any gate is the 'clear bag policy'. It states that any bag that comes into our stadium must be 12\" x 12\" x 6\" and clear, else it must be 4.5\" x 6.5\". There are no exceptions to this rule. Of course, there are other stipulations on the bag type, but I'm not here to explain that.\n\nSo, in most instances where we're enforcing the clear bag policy, we often turn customers away to the local insured bag check stations, so that they can check their bag in and get a clear bag that they can bring back to the stadium. Unfortunately, some people aren't so accepting of the policy. Cue this day a little while ago, when we had a couple come to one of our lines that had a bag outside policy. \n\nWhen explained the policy not once (by our line controller), not twice (by our bag checker), not THRICE (by the supervisor on duty), but four bloody times by our on-duty officers, they refused to relent, **insisting** that 'they'd brought this bag into every game this season'. Cool, sucks to be you, we get people saying that all the time, and we still turn them around. \n\nThese people didn't want to leave though, they'd paid good money for their season tickets and felt entitled. So, they started pushing their way past the &lt;POLICE&gt; officers. Not just our security, but the ***POLICE OFFICERS.*** Boy howdy, you can bet those officers weren't happy. Politely, they grabbed the gentleman of the couple and turned him around, by which he swung back around and decked the officer in the face. The officers partner then chicken-winged the assailant and led him straight out the gate from which he came. His lady friend followed right behind him.\n\nThe end solution: Denied entry, and no paperwork for any of us event security folk. Hallelujah, another successful terrorist attack thwarted. /s",

        "text": "A year ago, I worked at a water park. Now a brief reminder of what was going on during that time, BLM was at its height, police officers were getting attacked, and everyone is racist. On my team, I was one of the few white guys (this is important). Now that we have the backstory, onto the event.\n\nI got to work early one day, and my supervisor told me to give a break to the officer at the back gate who had been there since early that morning. This means that for the next hour, I will be checking employees bags and scanning them in. As it just so happens, majority of the staff is black. I'm scanning away, going as quickly as I can as a line is forming. My favorite security buddy shows up and he helps me check bags. Now whenever we are together, we make sure everyone around is having a good time, we joke with people and try to have them start off with a good day. Queue employee. I will be Me, my buddy will be SB (security buddy) and the employee will be DE (disgruntled employee).\n\nMe: Hey how are you today?\n\nDE: *mumble* Why do I need yall to check my bag?\n\nSB: (joking tone) We just got to make you aren't a terroriser or nuthin.\n\nDE: I'm not the terrorist, you are!\n\n*SB and I look at one another*\n\nMe: what are you talking about?\n\nDE: yall out here shootin us black folk just for being black! \n\nSB: First off, we aren't police. Second, I AM BLACK FOLK! (He was)\n\nDE: You an oreo. Give me my bag. I ain't callin yall for shit.\n\nSB: Alright. Have a good day.\n\nMe: Take care!\n\nNow yall know how things spread through the teams. By the end of the hour, the entire team knew about that, including our dispatch office, management, and everyone in ear shot. After back gates break was done, my supervisor put me and SB on park patrol, which is my favorite because I like to socialize with the people and employees. After one of my patrols, I stop by the dispatch office to cool down and get some water. That's when a call comes for dispatch about \"disorderly conduct\". Now the person who called it in sounded like they were laughing a bit. Since I was nearby, I responded to it.\n\nOut comes DE from the shop. We make eye contact and he immediately looks down. I need information on the call so I have to talk to him and he has to answer or I'm calling it all clear and moving on. I start asking the usual questions and he is mumbling. I can't hear. If he won't answer then someone else will. \n\nMe: I can't hear you. Can you tell me who you called me here for?\n\nDE: *mumbling* It's him and him. \n\nHe then proceeds to swing his arms around like wet noodles. He basically pointed to the entire crowd who has now gathered around us. I look around and spot SB coming from my flank and I spot 2 early teens staring at us looking scared. I think I know who it is. I motion SB to talk to the employee and get info while I talk to the kids. Apparently they were shoving ice down their own pants (ok then) and the employee never said anything to them. Basically called the security team on two kids who, by the way, didn't speak english (they had a third friend who did speak english). Was it a dumb thing to do? Yes. Did they hurt anyone? No. Did they expose themselves? No. Alright then a warning and carry on. \n\nNow here's the thing. At our company, protocol is to try and handle it yourself unless the situation becomes hostile or aggressive, then call security. He just called us. That's a no-no.\n\nI tell the kids to wait there and I walked over to SB to get the full picture from the info we gathered. The kids told the truth, except the employee never mentioned what their conduct was.\n\nMe: what actions did you witness to call us here for?\n\nDE: Disorderly Conduct (this is what management tells their employees to call us for).\n\nMe: We got that, but what specifically did you see?\n\nSB shows me his notepad that says \"Two kids huddling in a corner.....Italian?\" (I knew they were actually Romanian)\n\nDE: I saw them sitting over there, laughing with their backs to me.\n\nMe: So you called us here because people were laughing? At a water park???\n\nDE looks like stone. While yes, something was happening, the employee had NO idea that it was and we later surmised that he basically called us there to harass these kids. We called all clear, told the kids they could leave, but if we got called on them again they would be in trouble.\n\nSB and I start heading back to dispatch when DE's manager came over to see what had happened and we told him what happened and shared our notes with him. Manager went over to talk to DE and DE began raising his voice about how we harassed him for calling us out there against some terrorists. Upon seeing who these \"terrorists\" were. DE got sent home for the day.\n\nTL;DR: Employee calls security racist terrorists, proceeds to be racist and call kids terrorists.",

In stationed at a new post this year, an elementary school, and every school our company is contracted to has a binder that has the paperwork we use on duty. Well the binder for this school looks like it's been chewed up by a pack of dogs. So since this is back to school time and all the stores have school suplies on clearance, I bought a new binder to replace the crappy one. \n\nWhile I'm transferring paperwork from the old binder to the new one. One of the supervisors shows up with some paperwork we needed. He asked me what I was doing and I tell him about replacing the old binder. I finish what I'm doing and toss the old binder into a trashcan. He asked if I needed anything, I say no then he informs me that I will have to be written up. I ask him why and he replies with \"Well your mishandling company property and that's a violation of company policy.\" I'm still waiting to see if the company actually dose anything about me replacing a raggedy old binder. \n\nFor the record, yes I could request a new binder from the company but in my experience, I'd have better luck pulling teeth with a pair of tweezers.",

        "text": "Short run of our hospital's escalation calls:\n\n**Standby:** Patient expected to be agitated. Security requested to be present during high stress procedures (informing them they're on a psych hold and can't leave; running an IV; etc.), but not to intervene unless directly requested or patient escalates to violence or moderate aggression.\n\n**Staff Assist:** Patient already agitated. Security is requested to approach on standby, but may intervene if they deem necessary, no further request by staff required.\n\n**Combative Code:** RNs have lost control of the situation and security response / intervention is absolutely necessary.\n\n-----\n\nSituation:\n\n**Call 1: Combative code activated.** 50 yo male patient, 64 yo female visitor (mother). Patient severely autistic, developmentally challenged, \"mind of a child.\" History of violence. Security supervisor arrives with two officers. Upon arrival, primary RN stands in front of the door and holds out her hands, then says \"no no no don't go in, let us handle it.\" Supervisor hears screaming inside, looks over, sees patient coming at Mommy, screaming. Supervisor ignores nurse, pushes past her. Patient gets restrained to bed.\n\nNurse makes a big deal about security escalating a situation, asks to speak with supervisor. Supervisor notifies that he is such, advises her to speak with the department director if she has a problem with our response.\n\n-----\n\nShift change. Day supervisor tells us about previous call during briefing.\n\n-----\n\n**Call 2: Combative code activated,** during briefing. We're confused because patient was in restraints. We bolt over there ASAP. Same deal, nurse tries to block access, says \"All you security do is just make it worse!\" Mommy is in the room with patient, patient is banshee screeching at her, standing up, flailing his arms.\n\nI decide to put the ball in the RN's court by making her seriously think about what she's saying. \"So are you telling us you want us to leave? You've got it under control?\"\n\nShe suddenly realizes what that means. \"No no no, stay please. Let me just try to fix this.\" Charge nurse explains to my supervisor that Mommy Hazardhands removed the restraints. He asks why Mommy was still in the room with the patient. Charge says they thought Mommy could calm him down. We ask Mommy to step out for the time being while RN tries to talk patient down.\n\nMeanwhile, from the hall, I'm watching the primary RN try and fail to de-escalate the patient. While RN is mid-sentence, patient screams at RN and swings at her face, without warning. It misses, but barely.\n\n[SECURITY MODE, GO.](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/conan_spaz.gif)\n\nMy supervisor follows my lead. This time, we ignore the RN telling us to stop. We both go in, grab the patient under each arm, and I say \"Get the softs!\" We push patient into bed after he gives a solid kick to my supervisor's chest. Charge and a new nurse come to help us, bringing soft restraints (hard restraints are not permitted outside of ICU and ER per policy).\n\nMommy Screamyhands come charging into the room, screeching at us to let go of her boy. I'm busy trying to keep Patient Punchyface from hitting anyone, and Mommy is diving at the restraints to take them off. I can't let go of Patient, so I stare her dead in the eyes and say \"If you get that restraint off, we're kicking you out. Get out of the room, now.\" Mommy stops trying to pull the restraint, and now goes to pointing in Patient Screamyhead's face and saying \"STOP THIS RIGHT NOW! STOP!\" Which obviously isn't helping.\n\nPatient's RN (the same one I just protected from a beating) is now grabbing my arm and trying to pull me off of the patient. She screams, \"SHE'S JUST TRYING TO HELP!\" I'm *fed up* with this nurse's ungrateful bullshit at this point, yank my arm out of her grip, and shout \"Get your hands off of me and let me do my damned job.\" She storms out. I later discover she called the house supervisor (went over charge's head) to report me.\n\n-----\n\nDebrief.\n\nAnyway, situation's done. Patient's in restraints. Mommy Stupidass is in there promising the patient we'll take the restraints off in five minutes, then comes up to us saying *we* promised they'd come off in five minutes and that we're lying to him now. I reiterate my warning that if she so much as touches the restraints, we're skipping the warnings, ignoring the nurses, and going straight to trespassing her.\n\nWe advise Charge that Mommy be removed from property anyway because she's a risk to staff. Charge refuses. We advise that if Mommy stays, a sitter be present in the room. Charge refuses. We decide not to push the issue, no matter what the safety risk is, because House Supervisor is onboard with them too. Bear in mind, house supervisors are the ultimate authority for most things in a hospital.\n\nSo now we're blamed for escalating a situation that was already escalated. We cut our losses and politely bow out. They say they have it under control? Okay then.\n\n-----\n\nTwenty minutes later, I'm on lunch. Combative code, same room. Patient was being transferred, EMTs were getting ready to move him. The floor didn't call us to safety standby like we requested. As soon as the restraints were off, patient lunged at Mommy Idiotface.\n\nOf course, all of this was our fault for \"scaring the patient,\" right?",

        "text": "I just discovered this sub, and I thought I’d share a story from my summer working in security.\n \nIt was the summer after I finished high school (so more than a decade ago now), and I worked for a small security firm that has since been swallowed up by a much larger one.\n \nThere were typically two types of jobs we were hired for: parking control and overnight construction site monitoring. While the construction sites tended to be boring (except for the time I found an entire family of skunks), parking gigs proved far more interesting.\n \nThe most common type of parking job involved gate control. Typically parking garages in the city would have an hourly rate that kicked in after the first hour – i.e. you would get a stub on your way in, and if you left before 60 minutes you paid nothing, otherwise you paid the rate for every hour after that. But when there were special events going on in the arena or convention centre we would get hired to enforce different rules.\n \nDuring special events, the 'first hour is free' rule still applied, but anything after that required you to buy an all-day pass at a fixed rate (normally $10). We would get hired to specifically sell these passes at the gates, and enforce the 1-hour rule on the way out (for whatever reason the normal tellers weren't allowed to work these events).\n \nOne of my first gigs was for a large religious conference – Mormons, to be exact. The morning was very busy, but it went very smoothly. All those attending the conference seemed to know ahead of time that they would need to pay $10 up front for their all-day pass, and not even one of them attempted to proselytize to me. Those who just wanted to do a bit of shopping downtown were also mostly okay with it once I explained that they would either need to pay me $10 or be gone within an hour. A few people were ticked off at having to pay $10 when the normal cost for their 3 hours of business would have been $4, but no one gave me a really hard time.\n \nThe busiest time passed completely without incident, and the boredom set in. Then, out of the blue, a minivan (remember those?) came roaring up to the gate, and a very irate looking man vigorously rolled down his window. The following exchange then occurred between me (B), the man (M), and his very embarrassed preteen daughter (D), who was sitting in the passenger seat.\n\n&gt;B: Good day sir, it is event parking at this location today. You can either pay ten dollars for an all-day pass, or park for free for one--\n \n&gt;M: YOU GUYS NEED TO WATCH WHAT YOU SAY!! IF YOU’RE NOT CAREFUL YOU’RE GOING TO PISS OFF A BUNCH OF PEOPLE AND GET FIRED!!\n \n&gt;B: I’m sorry sir, is something wrong?\n \n&gt;M: YEAH!! I ASKED YOUR BITCH COWORKER AT THE EXIT WHAT THE SPECIAL EVENT WAS AND SHE SAID THAT THEY WERE ALL MORMONS. SHE NEEDS TO WATCH WHAT SHE SAYS!! NOT EVERYONE WHO PARKED HERE WAS A MORMON!! A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE VERY ANGRY THAT SHE LABELED THEM LIKE THAT!!\n \n&gt;D: Dad, can we just go?\n \n&gt;M: NO, I NEED TO TEACH THIS PUNK A LESSON!! HE’S GOING TO GET IN A LOT OF TROUBLE WITH A LOT OF PEOPLE IF HE JUST THINKS HE CAN LABEL PEOPLE LIKE THAT!!&gt;\n \nAt this point I realize what was going on. My one coworkers (who was indeed female, though certainly not a ‘bitch’) who was working the exit must have used imprecise language to describe the special event. Most rational people would gotten the gist of it and not made a big deal. Evidently this guy took umbrage with her phrasing, and now was projecting her words onto the rest of us\n \nSo, I did the only thing I could at that point:\n\n&gt;B: Sir, it is event parking at this location today. You can either pay ten dollars for an all-day pass, or park for free for one hour.\n \n&gt;M: JUST GIVE ME A DAMN PASS!! I WON’T BE STAYING!! I’LL ALSO BE CALLING YOUR COMPANY TO TELL THEM HOW CARELESS AND RUDE THEIR EMPLOYEES ARE!!\n\n \nSo I scanned him a pass and handed it to him. True to his word, he drove straight through the bottom floor of the parking garage right to the exit. My colleagues there were quite perplexed, but did get a good laugh when I told them the story later.\n \nI think, most of all, I just felt sorry for his daughter.\n\nEDIT: formatting",

        "text": "I work in an ER of a hospital, and while we don't have a \"psych area\" we do have a portion of the ER set aside for psychiatric patients that are waiting to be placed in facilities.  If you're trying to figure out the difference, it's that if we call it a psych area the hospital gets fined.\n\n    Moving on!  Recently (yesterday) we get a patient that's completely out of his fucking mind, my money is still on synthetic drugs because the piss test didn't show up anything.  As soon as I sit down to start my shift he's talking about how he's dale earnhardt senior and they found his sons remains under the Daytona 500 in the year 2000 and the same son is responsible for 9/11 because the terrorists thought his son was him in the trump towers so they flew airplanes into the buildings to get rid of him.  He went on for a while but it got pretty incoherent.\n\n    Now I thought this was pretty harmless and I kind of indulged him and kept the conversation going for a while until he would come out of his room trying to leave, when he did I would remind him he's gotta stay in the room, he'd say oh yeah and turn around and go back.  Eventually he started getting aggressive, but still carried on so I just ignored him being aggressive and kept talking to him.  I go to let medical staff know he's getting aggressive,  come back and the officer on watch tells me he grabbed her by the wrist.  I'm not okay with this for 2 reasons, the first is she's new and if she lets that happen with the wrong person she will get badly hurt.  The other being he has no business being that close to her.  \n\n    I go and make it clear to him that if he touches any staff again he will get dropped.  He say he understands and I go back to watch with the other officer and he starts making very clear threats to us and then he say I want the one on the left (talking about the female officer working with me) so I get up and start clearing anything out of the hallway while he's carrying on about how he's going to hit her like a truck etc etc.  when I start dragging stuff away he says \"are you taking that to Todd? I need you to tell him something\" so I told him \"no I'm making room so when you go to hit her I can throw your ass to the ground without hitting your head on anything\". When I tell him that he straightens up for a few minutes, and then the female officer goes to take a bathroom break.\n\n     Within minutes of her being gone, he tries to leave again and I tell him to go back, which he does until he turns around and approaches me again.  This time saying \"you better be on the swat team or navy seals because I'm coming for your ass!\" And raises a fist and cocks it back.  As soon as he raises his fist I tackle him, hold him to the ground while I radio for backup just in case he tries to get a little wild again, and then hook an arm under his and drag him back to the room. After that he just sat in the floor for a while like he was trying to figure out what happened, once he got up he did try to raise a fist at a 3rd officer until I told him to put the fist down or I'll drop him again and he settled down real fast.  \n    This actually left out a lot,  I was trying to condense about 4 hours worth of smaller shit but it's hard to really show why I was as much of a dick to him as I was without telling all of the details, but that's been my fun for this week! (Who am I kidding.  It's the ER.)",

        "text": "I don't know if this is in the right place, because I'm not a security guard myself, but I stumbled across this sub and I was struck by how much stick you guys have to put up with. Why would people even behave like that? \n\nFirstly, the security staff that I've met have all just been people doing their jobs, normally in the least confrontational way possible. There's no reason to be unpleasant to them.\n\nSecondly, being unpleasant won't achieve anything. The people on the door/gate/wherever are there to enforce the rules; they don't make the rules. The people who make the rules stay as far away from the general public as possible. Whichever poor working soul you are talking to doesn't have the authority to waive the rules in your particular case and, let's face it, they have no reason to risk their job just to please a complete stranger.\n\nThirdly, and most importantly from my point of view, if you make the security person's life difficult, the most you can expect to achieve is to lose the benefit of whatever discretion they *do* have to interpret the rules in your favour. Being nasty to them is simply counterproductive.\n\nA case in point.\n\nSome years ago, a few friends and I attended a cricket match at a major international venue. Now, for people who don't know, cricket matches go on for a *long* time, so I didn't just have a packed lunch with me, I had a full blown picnic contained in a sort of insulated backpack thing with an whole extra section for plates and general accoutrements. As I was standing in the queue waiting to get in, I noticed a sign behind the security chaps listing all the things that you weren't allowed to bring into the ground, which included alcohol, drugs (no, really?) and, crucially, knives. Now, the reason that this caught my attention wasn't because I was tooled up (I wasn't), but because the accoutrements in my picnic thing included a full set of cutlery for four people. Oh dear, thought I.\n\nWhen my turn came at the front of the queue, I had a choice. I could have kept schtum and hoped for the best, I could have waited for the chap to find them and then argued with him or I could choose a third way. The way I chose was to give friend gate-keeper my best apologetic smile and say,\n\n\"I really am terribly sorry. It didn't even cross my mind when I was packing and I didn't think about it until I saw your sign, but the fact is that my picnic kit *does* have knives in it. Again, I am so sorry.\"\n\nThe clearly very experienced guard on the gate, to his credit, didn't immediately freak out at the mention of the word \"knives\" and asked me to show him the offending articles, so I unzipped the relevant pouch and displayed my contraband items. The nice gentleman removed one of the flimsy, pot-metal utensils in question, wobbled it a little and then slotted it back into place.\n\n\"I don't think we need to worry about that, sir,\" he said, \"enjoy the match.\" And he waved me through without further incident.\n\nNow, the point of this story is that, ridiculous and flimsy though they may have been, the items in my pack *were* knives and the security staff would have been fully within their rights to either confiscate them or to simply refuse me admission. If I'd been aggressive, abusive, arrogant or any of the other brands of nasty that people on this sub report as being their daily lot, they may have done just that. God knows I would, if I were in their position. As it is, a potential confrontation was avoided and nobody involved had to have their blood pressure raised or their day spoiled.\n\nAs an aside, the other benefit of this interaction was that, having assessed me as being polite, honest and, above all, eager to avoid infringing the regulations, the nice man at the gate didn't feel that it was necessary to search the rest of my bag, meaning that he missed the two bottles of wine and the half bottle of rum which formed what I like to think of as the backbone of the picnic.\n\nTL;DR: Be nice to security staff, and people in general, come to that. You have nothing to lose and everything to gain.",

Since cars will pile up \"waiting\" for guests to come out, part of my job is to keep the zone reserved for active pickup and drop off, not people waiting there for 15 mins.  \n\nMan is parked in drop off zone next to no parking sign, I walk up and let him know there is an available parking spot in front of him, 15 ft away. I didn't even ask this guy to move, just told him about the spot.  \n\n\"Shut up!\"  \n\"Excuse me, sir?\"  \n\"Shut up, I know!\"  \n\nHe then drives off and gets stuck in the exit line for the toll booths. I calmly walk up, take a picture of his license plate, and proceed to write him a violation for parking in a no parking zone. He would not roll down his window to take his copy so I placed it neatly under his windshield wiper blade. Smiled, waved, and told him to have a great day.  \n\nI'm guessing this guy repeatedly tries to break the rules and security always talks to him. Hence the immediate negativity toward me even though I'm just trying to be nice.  \n\nHappy Monday, everyone!\n\n\n",

I'm staying at a language camp in Germany and we go on trips at the weekends to München.\n\nWe have around 3 and a half hour for eating shopping and stuff and we need at least 3 people to go in to the city. \n\nSo one of my friends (let's call him Sam) wants to get a pair of headphones because he is leaving and he broke his pair of headphones. So we go in to Saturn (an electronics store like Mediamarkt). We look at headphones and we get some shitty cheap ones because Sam only has 20€ left.\n\nWhile we were looking for headphones my other friend (let's call him Josh) he is the weird kid at camp--no one really knows him. We just took him to be 3 people total. So he splits up with us in the store to look at webcams. He comes back to us saying he doesn't have enough money for anything, so we go to the exit (we forgot to buy the headphones because we are retarded). We are about to exit and the security snatches us. We realize we forgot about the headphones so we try to apologize, pay and leave, but they still take us in. \n\nWe were all keeping our cool because Sam and I thought it was just a misunderstanding. We go to the office and they show us a ripped, open webcam box. We deny that we did it. They tell us to empty our pockets and bags.\n\nThey search me (I'm clean) they search Sam (he's clean except the headphones), then they search Josh.\n\nTurns out he ripped open the package and took the webcam. He denies it and says he didn't do it. He is scared shitless, but as anyone could tell he looks harmless. Scared, he gives a fake name (we don't realize it because he writes it down). \n\nSecurity begins to write the report. I realize they are Turkish and explain the situation (I'm a Turk btw). They believe me and keep me off the report because they don't want to put thievery on my file just because of an misunderstanding. \n\nSo I become the middleman, because the guards can't speak English and Josh’s German is shit. So I realize he wrote a fake name and get really pissed off, because our situation is shit enough and he still insists on lying. I tell the security about the false name and call my parents about the situation.\n\nCamp staff become involved and I get out without any problem. Sam and Josh go to the police station. They come back 2 hours later. Turns out Josh is autistic and has a persona which is a thief.\n\nI don't know what happened after the police took them. I'll update when I know.\n\nTL;DR Autistic kid steals webcam, sets off all kinds of alarms in my family and ruins the trip.\nEDİT: grammar by hallyujunkie",

That same week our former account manager split for a new gig leaving the new guy with a mess to fix.\nI meet him for the first time as he walks in with the client an hour before my shift ended at 0800. i am sitting at the front desk in the lobby and greet him. It was obvious he was quite stressed but was polite and shook my hand.\nI mention to him the issue of my pay and he lets out a big sigh, (i was 1 of many employees with this issue).\nI drive 30 miles to my post and back and i explain that i was really counting on the check for gas or i won't be able to make it home after my next scheduled shift. He then says not to worry and he'll see me again later.\nIt's now 0030 hours approximately the next shift and he walks in and asks for our time sheets, we chat a little and on his way out he says he's very sorry for the situation and gives me $20 bucks.\nI declined at first but he expressed that it's not a big deal and he wants to know that gas won't be a problem for me until the problem is sorted. He smiles and exits out the door.\nI thought that was pretty cool considering how my old manager seemed to use me alot and never pay me on time for overtime projects. In fact i left the company for a month and came back after meeting a very inept manager that made my old manager look like a genius.\nAnyway that's my story and i apologize for how long it is but considering how much some of us go to work and feel expendable or undervalued by some management, there are still good people out there and they make for some good leaders.\nUnless of course he's honey dicking me.. \n\nTL;DR: New manager gave me $20 and made me feel like a valued employee.\n\nEdites for spelling and grammar\n",

        "text": "I will start by saying that some people might find this story distressing!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThis happened around November a few years back, in an Australian summer when we were having a heatwave and the average temperature was about 40 Celsius (104F), the Shopping Center (SC) I was working at (at that time) had majority underground parking, however the average temperature in the car park was around 25C (77F).\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI had just finished my lunch break and was coming out of the Security Office when a person came running up to me \"There's two children locked in a car over there!\"\n\nI had the person take me over to the car, and sure enough two children were inside. A 1 year old and a 4 year old. I instantly keyed up my radio and notified CM of the issue and the number plate for a call to go over the PA for the owner to return (Standard policy), they also notified the major retailers and had them make announcements as well. I tried to get the older child to open the door, however the big issue was the fact that the owner had left the radio on and it was THUMPING. I could feel the glass rattling and I was worried about what was happening to the little kids ears (I know all about hearing loss as I suffer from Tinnitus)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAfter five minutes, I called the Police and advised CM, a minute later the Centre Manager was down with me and she was livid. Another 4 minutes later and 2 Police cars had shown up (8 Police in total), 6 of them were directed to the Ambulance and Fire entrances, 2 minutes later 1 of them returned with 2 paramedics and another 2 minutes later another had returned with a Fire Crew (6 of them). The Emergency Services did a quick analasys and the Police asked for another announcement to be put over the PA, with the Police going to the major stores to make sure that announcements were put over the PA in those stores as well.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIt was now 15 minutes since I had first been advised and the Police decided that they would give it another 5 minutes before forcing entry to the car (Much to the delight of the FD, who had the hammers ready), during the five minutes they discussed which window to break and decided on the small window on the front passenger side, as they wanted as little glass debris inside the car, incase it hit one of the kids (Fun Fact: Those little windows are also the most expensive to replace, but that had no bearing on the decision of which one to break).\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo, the five minutes are up and no sign of the owner. The FD lines up on the window and myself and an officer are on the opposite side of the car, trying to keep the children focused on us. The glass was broken with ease, but there was a problem, nobody could reach the door handle to open the door (Took another 5ish minutes for everybody to try), so the decision was made to smash the passenger window, which crumpled like a Prom Dress. The FD then assisted the smallest police officer through the window and once inside she had a problem, she couldn't unlock the door from the inside either and nobody knew where the door release button was. So the police officer passed the children through the window, then shut off the radio.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo, after 25 minutes, we finally had the children out who were checked over by the Paramedics and found to be in good health, if a little scared (They did an amazing job keeping the children as calm as could be expected, given the circumstances). I'm not sure exactly when the next person showed up, but he was the District Fire Chief who had heard it on the radio and gotten there as quickly as he could. Now, up until this point the Police had been in charge as decided by the ranking Fireman on site (When all emergency services are on site the FD is in charge, unless they give it to someone else). However, once the DCF arrived, he assumed control of the overall situation (This wasn't a power trip or anything for him, it was calculated on his part). When the owner finally arrived back at his car, it had been 45minutes since initially being advised and he had the most confused look on his face. Why were his children out of the car? Why were the window's smashed? What was with all the emergency services on site?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nD (Dad): What's going on? Did something happen to my children? (This wasn't directed at anyone, just whoever was listening)\n\nThe DFC motioned for the lead Policeman to go over and talk to the Father and the DFC followed closely behind.\n\nI didn't pay too much to the conversation as I was with the children, however everyone perked up when they heard the following:\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nD: I don't see what the big deal is, I was only gone for five minutes. (It was at this moment, that Daddy knew. He fucked up!)\n\nDFC: \\*Pushes past the policeman and gets right into the Dad's face\\* Are you fucking kidding me? You. Stupid. Sunnovabitch! You were gone for at least Forty-Five. Fucking. Minutes! \\*DFC started poking the Dad in the chest to emphasize the point\\* How you still have your children is fucking beyond me! But don't worry, DCS has been informed and they will be having a *lovely* little chat with you. You fucking disgust me! \\*With that, DFC turns around and walks away, leaving Dad with his mouth agape and some very shocked and surprised onlookers\\*\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe policeman then went about his official business, getting Dad's ID, making him call his wife to come pick up the kids, writing out the tickets and emphasising the point of him going straight to the local PD after this, for his formal statement and interview with DCS.\n\nThat's pretty much the end of the story. The Mother showed up about 20 mins later and absolutely ripped into ex-hubby and took the kids away. Dad went off to the Police Station with the police, DFC went inside the shopping center and the other FD and paramedics went back to their stations.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI've had to deal with many children/animals locked in car calls and everyone always gives the same basic two excuses.\n\n1) I was only gone for five minutes; and\n\n2) They were asleep, I didn't want to wake them\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThere is never a good reason to leave a child/animal locked in a car (Yes, even if you left the window cracked and/or AC running) and I take great pleasure in smashing your window(s) to free who/whatever is inside and even greater pleasure when you're slapped with a Justice Boner!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nFor my next post, I'll try to post some of the more amusing things that I have come across.\n\nEDIT: Spellung and gremmer erorrs.",

He had attempted suicide while his GF was showering (or something of that general since, its unclear as always)\n\nThe women answering the door was a useless hoebag. She couldn't do anything but scream and cry. Thats all she was doing. (bitch.) \n\nI immidately moved the man flat onto his back and hit my one-touch 911 button. (If you don't have this, consider it. Free on app store.) \n\n\"911 where is your emergency?\" \n\nMy first words were \"(name of hotel, room number.) (repeat) (repeat) man cut open his own throat. He's bleeding out. (repeat location) 2-3\" cut front of throat.\" I wasn't listening, i was yelling angrily into my speakerphone while I went from \"What now...\" to \"holy shit wtf 911 help me please\" in about 3 seconds. I began spewing out info. \"Concious and breathing. Having trouble keeping airway clear. This is dark blood, it's dark blood not light blood. Unable to stop bleeding.\" I was thinking out loud probably.\n\nWhile shouting into the phone on the ground next to me I went right in. Trying to find the cut was hard, I was just smearing blood. I stretched his shirt as hard as I could then saw the wound. At first I tried using my hands and applying pressure... I applied pressure and his blood came up out of sides of my palm. It didn't do shit. \n\nI grabbed a towel and it didn't do shit. Out of random adrenaline I grab the trashcan, took the plastic bag and tried using that. It kinda worked... I wrapped a pair of\njeans around his neck with the plastic under it... That's as close as I got to slowing it down. \n\nThe entire time the guy is fighting me kinda sorta, putting his hands in the way, spitting, coughing, attempting to roll over. I tightened the jeans until I thought I was restricting bleeding. I was restricting airflow.\n\nIn my head I couldn't decide if I wanted him to stop breathing or stop bleeding. I didn't know what to do. In my panic I just didnt know. I was a not-medically-trained dude who responded there first. (and they say police/fire are first responders... Shesh....)\n\n\nI held the jeans/plastic bag in place, letting lose on the jeans only to have the massive amount of blood come out when he could breath easily.\n\nMan to men here guys. I wanted to cry. I didn't know what to do and I felt like I was supposed to. When your there, honestly, your macho \"I'm not scared\" means nothing. \"Just stop the bleeding\" was my only thought.\n\nI kept trying to do what I thought I could do, kept as much pressure on the wound as possible. At one point I rolled him on his side (drunk vomit position) and let him puke what was in his mouth. \n\nOnce he puked we shared about 2 minutes of him trying to breath and me trying to keep pressure on the wound. The women was screaming and crying I couldn't hear my speakerphone, all I knew was the call to 911 had been placed and they probably heard everything I've been screaming. Fire Rescue arrived code 3, I kept my hands in position until we did a \"One! Two! Three!\" where the medic changed physical positions with me. \n\nHands completely bloody, smelling metalic, adrenaline so high I couldnt catch my breath or talk functionally, I had his coughed blood on my uniform and shirt and blood where he was touching me from restricting his airway.\n\nI let them do they're thing and got the fuck out of the way, holding the useless women back with my bloody hands while EMS did whatever they were doing. Additional Rescue, engine, and city police arrive all shortly after. \n\nThe guy lived! His wound wasn't nearly as critical as I thought, he cut into his throat only slightly so the amount entering his stomach/lungs was a fraction of what I thought in my head. The cut in reality was small, he hit a none critical vein or something and thus the blood. He did go deep enough to slightly enter his throat, any bigger he would have drowned. \n\nI didn't save his life, he probably would have lived if I just stood there and watched like useless bitch. \n\nI tell this story because I want to scare some of you. Download some EMT-B practice material, it's free, and has constructive data on how to handle medical emergencies.\n\nDo you know the best posture to clear an airway? What about best posture when fluids restrict the airway? What about the head positioning of CPR? Was it 30:1 or 15:2?? Does it matter??\n\nBesides \"Apply Pressure\" do you know how to stop major bleeding? To the leg? To the arm? From the throat? \n\nI hope we get to a point where we can be certified on narcan.\n\nDo you know how to handle an elderly person with elevation sickness? \n\nDo you know what to do with broken bones?\n\nCan you honestly say, honestly, that you can walk up to any model handgun and safely disarm it? Don't macho your answer, most of you assholes have never held a glock that wasn't your dads.\n\nEach one of you do a self assessment. You'll be alone when shit hits the fan. Make sure your not half-assing a location that might require a professional response. Stay safe boys... Reading a little EMT-B material won't hurt you.",

I have a few stories from my many years of working different SC's but I'll start with this one and post some other ones later.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo it's around 10pm and most of the SC is locked up, apart from a few late night stores (Cinema's and major stores [Kmart, etc]) which are only accessible from select entrances, we get a call for a person requiring medical assistance at Kmart and proceed there, after performing the required First Aid and calling an ambulance, I'm put on Ambulance Detail (Which is waiting in the designated parking bay for them to arrive and escort them in).\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI'm standing out there waiting and diverting people from parking there as it's close to the ATMs and everybody is moving with minimal fuss, until \"The One\" shows up (You know The One, rules don't apply to them, because reasons)\n\nS(Me): Sorry sir, I'm going to have to ask you to move, we're waiting on an Ambulance to arrive for someone inside\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTO: I'll only be five minutes, I'm just going to the ATM\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nS: I'm sorry sir, but you need to move, all you have to do is back up 10m and you're in the non-emergency spot\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTO: \\*Gets out of his car and starts walking to the ATM\\* Yeah well, I'm just going to the ATM, so it's all good\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nS: \\*I just sigh and step aside as I can see the flashing Blue &amp; Reds in the background and know what's going to happen\\* Fine, whatever sir, don't say I didn't warn you!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAmbulance comes around the corner and I wave to them so they know I'm there. They see the car parked in the Emergency bay and pull in behind it so it's forming a T. The driver's side of the Ambulance is about an inch from the back of TO's vehicle, so there's nowhere for him to go. By this time, TO is trying to rush through his transaction and comes barging up to the Ambulance\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTO: Hey, can you move, you're blocking me in?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nA1: Sorry sir, there's an Emergency and we're in a hurry \\*Proceeds to start getting his kit from the Ambulance\\*\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTO: I'm in a hurry, I need you to move!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nS: Sir, you were told before that an Ambulance was coming and you refused to move.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTO: \\*Now angry\\* Fuck off you wannabe cop, you didn't say shit to me! \\*Back to A1\\* Are you going to move your Ambulance, or not?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nA1: \\*Looks at TO calmly\\* Not! \\*Collects his last 'bag' and begins to head inside with myself and the other Paramedic\\*\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBy this time, TO is livid, he's cussing and cursing whilst heading back to his car. I go inside with the Paramedics (Bags and stretcher/trolley) and direct them to the person inside, before heading back outside to make sure that TO doesn't do something completely stupid. At this point, I find him trying to Austin Powers his way out of the parking spot (Sorry, should have mentioned that the front of the car was parked up against a 3ft wall) and having no luck at all. I'm watching him from a distance when the Paramedics come out with the patient on the Trolley and proceed to load them into the back of the Ambulance\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTO: Finally, now you can move and I can get out of here!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nUnfortunately for TO and unbeknownst to me, whilst they were inside, one of them had called the police and informed them what was going on, the Police hadn't arrived yet but they had been told they were 5 minutes out. So once they've loaded up the patient, they begin doing some more checks, making sure the patient is comfortable, none of the electrodes for the machinery has come off, etc, etc.\n\nWhilst this is happening TO is getting angrier and angrier and I am waiting for him to snap and do something stupid, when lo and behold, Two Police cars come screaming into view and pull in nearby. 4 officers get out and come over to us and the Paramedic just points to TO and says \"That's him\" before going back to his work\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nP1: YOU! \\*Points at TO\\* HERE. NOW! \\*Points to his own feet\\*\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTO: \\*Slowly walks over, head lowered\\* Yes Officer?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nP1: First; Why are you parked in an Emergency Bay and Secondly; Why are you yelling at the Paramedics whose spot you are parked in?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTO: I didn't know it was an Emergency Only spot, I was just going to the ATM. I got angry when they blocked me in because I have somewhere important to be!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nP1: \\*Looks from TO to me\\* Is this true?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nS: No sir, I told him twice what they bay was for and that the Ambulance was expected, he just didn't care\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTO: \\*Loudly and in Anger, trying to sell his own version\\* That's a load of shit, you didn't say anything, you just stood over there \\*Waves to a spot nearby\\* and only came over when you saw the Ambulance coming whilst I was at the ATM\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nP1: \\*Looks from TO, to me, to TO and back to me and sighs\\* So who am I going to believe?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAt this point I'm in a bit of a pickle as I have no proof of what I said, or at least I didn't know that I had any, until a voice pipes up from some random person who had been there the entire time\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nR: Actually Officer, the Guard did tell the guy to move, twice. I've been here the entire time as I'm waiting for a jump start, so I know for a fact that it happened.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTO: \\*Looks angrily to the Random citizen who has just destroyed his story\\* Nobody fucking asked you. Mind your own goddamned business!!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nP1: \\*A nice big grin comes over his face and he looks TO squarely in the eye\\* Get in your car now, I'll deall with you in a minute!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTO heads back to his car, hops inside and slams the door shut, the Police talk with the Paramedics, patient and me for a little bit whilst the Paramedics are doing the last of their checks, before stating they are good to go. As one of the Paramedics gets into the driver's seat, one of the Police Officers gets in his car and goes to pull up behind the Ambulance, TO has seen the Ambulance getting ready to leave, so he starts his car as well. As the ambulance pulls away TO's jaw hits the floor when it is replaced by a Police Car. At this point, it's now just TO getting reamed by the cop for everything that he's done. I'm just taking notes for the report that I have to write up. TO gets a few tickets for his trouble and is let go.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSorry it was such a long story and the formatting is probably terrible, but I hope you enjoyed! Don't worry, I have 8 years of stories from Security, so there's definitely more to come!\n\nEDIT: Some formatting",

        "text": "So this story is hands down one of the craziest, and I never actually saw the other party in person.\n\nPart of my job is to occasionally work the Reception/Dispatch desk, which is at the very front of our facility. The main desk phone is the main Zoo phone numbers; this means most calls are filtered and received at this desk. So as a result, there are plenty of nutty calls that come in every day. One day, I’ll do a /u/2BlueZebras and post a bunch of these conversations on a compilation post. This phone call, however, deserves its own story. \n\nIt was a slow day in March, I believe. The exact date doesn’t matter. What does matter is the fact that the day was exceptionally slow. Maybe 150 in the park the whole day (for those who aren’t aware, that is EXTREMELY SLOW; busy is about 5,000), so naturally, anything can make the day exciting. A bird shitting on someone would make the day exciting. Actually, that would make any day exciting, but I’m getting off track.\n\nThe day began normal as every one: I come in at 8 am, help guests resolve problems, and try to make phone calls reach their destination. About 1 o’clock, my supervisor comes to relieve me for a break. Taking the opportunity to stretch my legs and grab some food, I walk to our break room to grab my lunch. \n\nRemembering I forgot something at my desk, I walked back to the front where I see my supervisor with a puzzled look on her face. She has the phone receiver to her ear, and covered the mouth piece, mouthing for me to listen, placing the call on speaker. As I later find out, this is how the conversation transpired. It was short, but so memorable.\n\nS is my supervisor (same one from the other stories)\nIP is insane person\n\nS: Thank you for calling *******, how can I help you?\n\nIP: I need to donate $10.\n\nS: Yes sir. Our address is [says our address], you can mail it to us at that address.\n\nIP: No, I need someone to come get it from me.\n\nS: Sir, we can’t come get the money but are happy to accept your donation through the mail.\n\n(This is where the conversation does a complete nosedive. Coincidentally, this is the point I walk in to hear it. I only caught the tail end of this sentence, but heard everything else.)\n\nIP: Well, I don’t understand why parents can kill their kids for gas money, but I can’t get a McChicken combo from McDonalds.\n\n(Swear to everything he said that)\n\nS: Sir...?\n\nIP: Well, I need to speak to your supervisor, because I don’t want the animals to starve because I can’t donate my $10 because of what’s happening between us.\n\n(Yes he said ‘because’ three times)\n\nS: Sir, I am the supervisor, and the animals aren’t going to starve because you can’t donate your $10.\n\nIP: Well, I need to donate my $10 because I don’t want the dinosaurs to come out of my toilet and eat me.\n\n(At this point, we’ve figured out that he is probably intoxicated on something, and just want him off the phone as quick as possible. Much respect to my boss; she kept her cool and approached the situation calm, cool, and collected.)\n\nS: Well sir, you can still mail us the donation.\n\nIP: Well, I’m gonna call back in a little while to talk to a supervisor.\n\nS: Yes sir, I’ll still be a supervisor then.\n\nIP: Ok good. Thanks. *Hangs up*\n\nAs soon as she sets down the hand piece, I immediately bust out in laughter, while she simply has a face of defeated resignation. We notified our boss of the caller. He laughed too.\n\nThe guy never did call back. but man, I sure wanted him to.\n\nThe amount of rare toilet-o-saur attacks is still at a solid zero in the world to my knowledge. \n",

        "text": "I work private security at a hospital. There is a drop off/pick up zone at the main entrance with 6 \"No Parking\" signs, no more than 15 ft away from each other. Part of my job is to keep this area clear for patients and emergency vehicles by redirecting deliveries to the loading zone just around the side of the building. Food also can't come through the front due to a lawsuit with a guest slipping on a spill. Most delivery guys stop giving me problems after I explain that. \n\nI've been threatened before and dealt with assholes but this situation might be the best interaction yet.\n\nDescription: Male, ~48, Grey Hair, Red GrubHub Polo shirt, middle eastern accent.\n\n Here's my report:\n\nGrubHub employee tried to park in drop off zone. I, TheMcDrunkard, informed him of our policy and redirected him where he should park instead. He began to call me obscenities, \"You fucking asshole, you piece of shit.\" and walked back to his car flipping me off with both hands. Instead of driving to the loading zone, he parked in the structure. I witnessed him attempting to push his food cart to the main entrance, where no food deliveries are allowed to go through, so I confronted him again and had to stop his cart by standing in front of it. \n\n\"Excuse me, sir. But you are not allowed to bring the delivery through the front entrance, I will escort you to the loading zone.\" \nHe eventually followed me when he could not push the cart past me. \n\nAs we were walking he said, \"You fucking asshole, I hope you die of a horrible disease! People like you need to die!\" I continued to hold my composure while receiving more insults about how i should die or be killed. I babysat him for the rest of his time at our location.\n\nWe continued to suite **** where his first load of food was delivered. I informed the staff of his actions and the reason I was escorting him since this was an abnormal situation. I escorted him out of the building and waiting for him to return.\n\nWhile waiting for the elevator in the lobby, he said, \"You know you should all die, especially your supervisors. You are all horrible people and need to get diseases!\" I replied with \"And that's your opinion sir and I respect your freedom of speech.\" \n\nThese were not direct threats and he did not attempt to attack me so I did not feel the need to kick him off the property just yet. I continued to escort him him off the property after his delivery was complete. We will be getting his information from Grub hub and he will be banned from this property. We have pictures and footage of him and his vehicle. \n\nDue to these comments, I believe there is a possibility of a heightened threat level if he was to return to this location.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nIf I didn't have prior military experience I'm not sure this would have gone the same way. I could tell he was even more upset that he wasn't getting a reaction out of me, which made me feel very good. I've already contacted GrubHub and he will no longer be delivering here, or maybe anywhere. At his age with his attitude, no wonder he's a delivery boy... or was. I think I handled it alright, but I'm biased.\n\nTl;Dr\nGrubHub Employee tried to park in no parking zone, cussed and threw a fit, made indirect death threats, I became his babysitter, he no longer delivers to this location or any location.\n\nEdit: Pictures removed, description added.",

        "text": "So this story actually happened Monday, July 31, and while I wasn’t there to witness the event, I have watched the security footage from the incident. This one of my newest stories, and probably one of my best.\n\nA little background: In a previous story, I mentioned a girl who peed near a tree as she was walking out of from an event. Well, this gate is a rolling gate that opens with an HID card which most employees have, while also having an outer swinging gate that can be closed and locked. The gate leads to our employee parking lot and the east end of the zoo. People try to sneak in the gate all the time, and they are always caught. One problem with the rolling gate though, is that there’s just barely enough space to squeeze through at the end for someone small. I won’t go into detail why or how to get in the hole in the gate because OPSEC. \n\nSo yesterday, throughout the day, I kept hearing coworkers talking about the “breach” the previous night. Curious, I asked around for what people knew. I got mixed stories, so I did what anyone curious enough would do: I talked the Head of IT into pulling up the security camera footage and burning it onto a disc for me. And this is what followed.\n\n6:20 pm: 7 young African American boys, ages 13-17, squeezed through the gate, run towards the nearest food cart, and are then off screen.\n\n6:25 pm: same boys come sprinting back towards the gate, long lollipops in hand, with our golf cart and 2 employees in hot pursuit. 2 kids hop fence, other 5 unable to escape. Boys stop, employees corner them. \n\n6:30 pm: Police show up outside gate, with one being a Lieutenant we will call Gina. One by one, the boys are pulled aside by individual officers, the ringleader and oldest boy being yelled at by Gina. After a little while, the ringleader is cuffed and placed in the back of a squad car. \n\n(From this point until about 7:20, nothing of interest happens. Kids get yelled at by cops and by our employees)\n\n7:20-8:10 pm (The good part): A blue minivan rolls up, Fast. A short, stout, and angry African American woman comes out of the driver’s door, and storms towards the group of cops. Before reaching them, she notices her charge in the back of a squad car. She changes direction, and charges right to the window. The window is rolled down, and she starts yelling. A lot. She looks towards Gina, and points to hi. Gina nods, opens the door, and pulls the boy out. The boy isn’t standing for more than thirty seconds when momma bear reaches up and smacks him with the force of a thousand breakups and cheating incidents combined. The boy smirks (Bad choice, kid). She smacks him again. And again. And again. All while yelling at the boy. She then stops, turn to three of the other boys, who are quite literally shaking, and calls them over. She yells at them too, smacks each of them one or two times, and sends them to the van. She goes back to the ringleader. Smack. Yell. Smack. Yell. Repeat for about 5-10 minutes. After a few minutes, she grabs him by the ear, shakes Gina’s hand, and drags him to the car. As she’s dragging him away, another dark blue minivan rolls up, and another short, stout, and even angrier African American woman, who walks up to a group of three officers. She talks with them for a while, then motions for her spawn, who is trying to make himself invisible on out golf cart, to approach. He grudging approaches, and they begin to walk away. Then, he smiles. Mom isn’t happy. She reaches up, grabs him by the collar and punches him in the side. He’s still smiling. She does it again, but this time, she doesn’t let go. She then chains a Mortal Kombat-esque punch combo directly into his back, stomach, face, and arms. All while the cops and our employees are laughing their asses off. Police hand out report numbers, pack up and leave. Outer gate is locked and employees scatter.\n\nIt is rumored that those kids are still being beaten to this day.\n",

        "text": "So one of our more popular exhibits is our primate exhibit. This exhibit houses most of our Great Apes and monkeys, and is often the site of many an incident. When two different type of apes interact, things tend go awry. Every time something happens, it is on the instigation of the apes outside the cage that are often encourage by rowdy friends or intoxicants during events. The primates love to respond, which only encourages said dumb person. Despite their ability to protect themselves, there are still things we watch out for: people throwing stuff comes to mind. The main issue with this is that when people throw stuff in, one of two things happens, the primate will play with it, throw it back, or throw something worse back. This story involves the third result.\n\nOne day, I was doing my rounds, when I hear a ruckus coming from the primates. One of the gorillas sounds rather upset, and I can hear giggling. Never a good combination.  I make my way towards the enclosure, and as I’m turning the corner, I immediately see the issue: a young girl, about 6 or 7,  throwing small clementines, many know them as cuties, towards our male gorilla. It should be noted that our male gorilla has a rather nasty disposition towards people who throw things, like any sensible animal. As I start to approach her and her group to confront them, I hear a distinctive grunt from the gorilla. I turn my head to look at him, and I see him slightly hunched forward, one hand under his butt, and a dead gaze on the girl. \n\nOh no. \n\nPlease don’t. \n\nBefore I could react, a large brown semi-solid emerges from the rear of the gorilla, into his hand. In the next second, he cocks back his arm, and flings a small dog sized excrement pile at sufficiently high speed towards the girl. Flying through the air like the world’s worst water balloon, the brown mass lands its mark. \n\nSquare in the little girls face.\n\nWhat follows is a cacophony of screaming, crying, howling, and honestly I couldn’t tell what was human and what was gorilla. Drowned out by this is the raucous laughter from a few near by patrons, one of which who is quite literally rolling on the ground. \n\nI race over to the scene, while radioing for a first aid kit and notifying keepers.  \n\nThe girl suffered minor injuries to her nose, but overall was more disgusted than injured. She cried the entire time they were in the zoo. I was prepared to ask them to leave, but I felt they learned their lesson. I laughed about it for the rest of the day, and still think about it every time I pass the exhibit.\n\nMoral of the story: Play stupid games, get stupid results.\n",

First one was scared of her own shadow,scared of driving her car into a garage, refused to listen to anything you had to say, Then would turn around and boast about how she knew everything about the site to such a degree that she could write the training manual after only 3 shifts (Spoiler, she could not).\n\nThen the next idiot get's sent along to replace the last 2 idiots. This one even worse yet, 20 something yr old Turd who gives you the \"yeah, Yeah i know\" whenever you tell him something or brief him about something during an exchange of shifts. Yet every time i come in to replace him, and ask \"how was the shift, what went on?\" i get a \"Oh nothing, quiet shift\" then he hauls ass outta here, only to leave me to find that he hasn't done half the shit he was supposed to do. Not only that but he consistently shows up at least 20-25 mins late for every shift, or just completly no shows, only to provide lame excuses upon return.\n\nBut does Company management do anything about this? no. My site supervisor and property manager are hitting the roof with how pissed they are over this nonsense, Meanwhile my company just yes mans them and promises to send somebody better. Meanwhile when i was up at headquarters the other day i got a glance of some of the new recruits and let me say, I am scared for the future. Half of them couldn't even speak English, and the other half? couldn't even answer a question like \"You working retail or Condos?\" after literally being told what they were doing not 5 mins before.\n\nWhat really pisses me off about most of this is when i was hired for this company earlier in the year they gave me a super hard time during my interview, Questioning if i was even fit for the job. Yet here we are 6 months later, and based on interactions with about 85% of the other guards i've come into contact with in this company, i feel like i should be rewarded with employee of the god damn year.\n\nAnywho that's my rant, thanks for coming along for the ride, Anyone else dealing with any coworkers they just want to throttle?",

        "text": "This story is kinda short, but still a good one.\n\nSo in addition to my security/guest service role, I also fill a basic first aid role. Someone collapses, I go make sure they aren’t dead. Kid falls? I patch him or her up. Simple stuff. Anything more serious than a bandage wrap or something like a seizure, we call 911, and I let the paramedics take over. My training came from becoming a Red Cross volunteer and eventually instructor, but I’m not an EMT (even though I hope to be soon). Most of my medical calls end up being people overheated, little cuts and bruises, the occasional deep cut. I have seen my fair share of seizures and heat strokes, and I never wish them on anyone. \n\nOne night, I was working a special event that for anonymity reasons I will just call Beer at the Zoo. It’s an event where brewing companies come from all over the region to let people sample good, local alcohol. It no longer exists in the same fashion, but it was a good event. Plenty of drunks, free booze after the event, free food during it. My kinda thing. \n\nI mentioned in a previous post that one of my jobs also is to park cars. We have a lot that we have to direct cars to park since it’s unpaved earth. The parking team has four members. One to direct into the lot, one to direct to the parkers, and two to park the cars. That night, the team was me, my supervisor from the last two stories (a lot of my stories involve her), my coworker Rick (name changed for anonymity), and a maintenance guy named Jack (again changed). Jack had a large vehicle called a Mule parked next to the entrance where we were all sitting near. The Mule had two seats and an utility bed, the bed being made of metal. The bed had very sharp corners, made like that from lots of redoing and refurbishing. I’m standing next to it, my supervisor is sitting on the edge of the bed, and Jack and Rick are standing next to me. \n\nWe were all talking, and suddenly, my supervisor gets quiet, looking at her hand. Suddenly, I see red covering her hand.\n\nMe: S, you ok? \n\nS: I think I cut my butt.\n\nMe: What?\n\nS: I felt something poke me in he butt and when I felt it with my hand, it came up bloody. \n\nMe: How bad are you bleeding?\n\nS: I don’t know, check for me.\n\nMe, internally: Did she just ask what I think she did.\n\nSure enough, she turns to face me, reaches in the backside of her pants, and literally pulls her left butt cheek out of her jeans. Not covered by anything. \n\nAfter making sure I wasn’t in some Twilight Zone, I tried to professionally look for any cuts. Of course I found nothing. After giving myself a few more seconds, I looked at her face. She was more concerned about her rear bleeding than her subordinate staring at her bare backside. \n\nMe: Nope, not bleeding. \n\nS: Are you sure?\n\nMe: I’m positive. Put your butt back in your pants. \n\nShe complied. I grabbed a nearby clean paper towel and some gloves to clean off her hand. Sure enough, once I clear away the caked on blood, I see a small, but kinda deep, cut in webbing on her left hand between the middle and ring finger.\n\nMe: There’s where your cut. (Pointing to it)\n\nS: Really? Huh, I was sure it was my butt. Oh well. \n\nI radioed for someone to bring the first aid kit. After patching her up, we shrugged it off and the night went on. Never did see her butt again, but honestly, I don’t think I want to. Not that it didn’t look alright (it did), but it just felt…odd. Although, it was pretty funny; we still laugh about it to this day. Makes a good story to tell newbies. \n\nAnd before anyone hops on the comments talking about “muh professionalism”. Was it professional? No. was it workplace appropriate? Probably not. But in the hell hole that is that parking lot (it’s worse than you think), we always need something to liven our day. \n\nNext time, the story of why kids shouldn’t throw oranges at gorillas. \n",

        "text": "When I was a teenager, I worked for a security company in a small Canadian town.\n\nOne of my postings was at a factory that made outboard motors and lawnmowers.  \n\nDuring the summer I worked there, we experienced some strange goings-on in the factory.\n\nOn patrol, we would use a Detex clock that was worn, and we would go to different stations around the factory where a Detex key was hung.  We'd put the key into the clock, and it would stamp the station number and the time on a strip of paper, presumably for insurance reasons, and to ensure we were actually doing our job.  \n\nA patrol of the factory would start on the hour and would take 35-40 minutes.  When we were done, we would return to the guard hut at the front corner of the property.\n\nAt night, the factory shut down.  There was no \"night shift\" in the summer.\n\nOften we would do one patrol, and by the next, things would be substantially different by the time we got back on the next patrol.  We started attributing these strange things to the \"Phantom\", as for the first while these things would just \"appear out of nowhere\".  This included things like barrels being moved out into the aisles, or tools scattered.  One time we found a forklift had been moved to block the aisle.  Keep in mind, there were no employees present.  The only people on site were the security guards.\n\nSnaking all through the plant were several assembly lines - two for outboard motors (different brands), and one for lawnmowers.  We would sometimes come by to see the lawnmower decks or outboard motor bodies that were hanging in place, swinging, like someone had been there just before us, and gave a few of them a push.\n\nThe factory was usually mostly dark, with just a few security lights on.  This added to the creepiness of the situation.  Several times we saw the phantom, standing in a superman type pose in one of the big garage-style overhead doors.  By the time we got down there, he was nowhere to be seen.\n\nOne time we heard music coming from the roof.  Another guard and I climbed up and saw the Phantom.  Fueled by the adrenaline of actually spotting the Phantom, we gave chase and actually jumped the gap between two rooftops.  The second one we landed on felt a bit spongy, and we started to rethink whether this was a good idea or not (the idea of falling 40 feet from the roof to the factory floor, if we fell through, wasn't appealing at all).   The Phantom managed to get down the ladder at the back of the building and over the back fence before we could catch up.  We called the police, who also called the RCMP (Royal Canadian Mounted Police) who brought in dogs to sniff for him.  Although they caught the scent, they couldn't find him.\n\nWe spent the entire summer playing cat and mouse with this person, and never caught him, or found out why he was doing this.\n\nThere was some speculation that he had been a guard from the security company that had the contract previous to our company - and that he had kept a set of keys.  We never found out for sure, and to this day it all remains a mystery.\n\nTo his credit, the Phantom was only mischievous.  We never had any evidence that he had damaged any part of the factory, or stole any property.  It was all geared around messing with us.",

        "text": "\nSo in addition to working in the day time, I also work different night time shifts: 24 hour patrol Security and Event Security. \n\nThe 24 night security is what it sounds like, but yet with a twist. One guard, alone, armed with a phone and keys, walks 40+ acreage of dark grounds, ensuring no one breaks in and no animals escape. They also have certain duties like locking and unlocking gates and doors for employees and vendors coming in at night. Yeah. It blows. And of course, being the hard worker I am, my bosses LOVE putting me on these shifts when the regular night guards call out. Yay. I could complain about this particular type of shift for many a post. And I probably will.\n\nEvent Security is a little different. Often times it’s a team of three or four: one at the gate where guests enter and are picked up by trams, one person in a truck watching vehicles, one in the parking booth to direct traffic, and one supervisor. Events are often pretty fun. Guests come in sober and excited, leave drunk and even more excited. Main downside to it is the mosquitoes in the summer and the cold in the winter. Also, unless the truck person or supervisor comes and visits you, you’ll be at your post b yourself for 4-5 hours at a time. There are also events that span the entire zoo for shorter times, but those are more staffed. But they’re significantly more preferable than normal night shifts. \n\nI have many stories about both, but one of my most memorable happened during an event. This event was a wedding at the same exhibit where my Rich Lady and Lazy Wolf story happened, from 7pm to midnight. Nothing particular interesting happened at the beginning of the event. Around 10pm people started coming out, leaving for the night, which is pretty common. My main job at this point is to ensure no one leaves with alcohol. Pesky liability. As I’m doing my thing, I see this woman in a pink dress literally stumble off the tram towards the gate. Not uncommon, but still peaks my interest. Making sure she can walk straight, I can hear her asking her friends to take her to the bathroom. I tell them that unfortunately there’s not public bathrooms open nearby. The girl starts crying, and her friends desperately try to console her.\n\n Suddenly the drunk girl starts to smile. Oh no. Anyone who’s worked in the security scene where they deal with drunk people, when they go from wildly inconsolable to suddenly elated, something’s about to happen. The girl breaks the grip of her friends, stumbles over to a near by potted tree. And pulls up her dress.\n\nOh No. \n\nShe looks at me dead in the eyes and screechs, “IMMA PEE HERE.”\n\nSon of a bitch. By this point there’s not much I can do. I can’t grab her, and I certainly don’t want to.\n\nAnd she starts to pee. All while yelling “THE WORLD IS MY TOILET” over and over.\n\nMy assumption is that this woman had not peed all day, because what followed was the longest, most intense, and apparently satisfying by the noises she made, sound of water flow I’ve ever heard. It sounded like someone uncapped a fire hydrant. \n\nAfter about a minute and a half, which is impressive for a solid stream of pee, she stops, pulls her dress back down, waddled over to me, puts her hand on my face, gives me the drunk girl moony eyes, and waddles off into the night with her friends. One of her friends starts apologizing, but I’m still in such a state of shock that I can only manage the words “Its ok, she had to pee.” \n\nThe rest of the night kicks off pretty uneventfully, but later my supervisor, also the same one from the wolf story, asks me if anything interesting happened.\n\nI simply replied, “Yep. I learned that apparently the world is one big toilet to drunk people.”\n\nDrunks never fail to entertain. \n\nEDIT: Formatting\n",

        "text": "(This is my first post on Reddit so apologies if it blows. Also, advanced apologies for slightly strong language)\n\nFirst, a little background. I'm currently employed as a Guest Services and Security associate at a fairly well known family attraction that has animals. My job spans a wide range of responsibilities, from parking cars to checking alarms to escorting guests out from the park. Because of this, I've gained a few stories from my time here, ones I feel are appropriate to share here. \n\nMany stories are nothing special: alarms going off where and when they shouldn't, people being just generally terrible, and employee drama. But there are a few that strike a chord with people, and I'm going to start with one of my favorite stories. Sit back, relax, and enjoy.\n\nThe Rich Lady and The Lazy Wolf\n\nCharacters:\n\nMe: An average height, average looking, slightly stocky employee, with a decent amount of time under my belt. I know a lot about my workplace, so I tend to have a grasp of what's going on.\n\nSupervisor: My team lead, who has over 5 years of experience (that's a lot for our company, I'll explain why in a later story). She's fair, but can be a witch at times. Very funny, but also can be very stern. \n\nCrazy lady: A lady who is of the mindset that if you have money, you can do anything without repoercussion.\n\nDirector: My supervisor’s boss’ boss. Cool guy, but can be very aggressive. Former military. He not only runs multiple departments, but is part of a group I call the Five. The Five are a group of five people who can point at you and instantly terminate your employment at their discretion. We keep him happy. Rarely comes out of his office expect if he's bored or pissed.\n\nIt's an warm spring morning and I'm doing my rounds in the area where our more fur-filled animals are (wolves, bears, etc.) located. Their exhibit has a boardwalk that overlooks the entire exhibit. There's also a fence that curves below to avoid solid objects being dropped or thrown into an exhibit. Despite this, you can still pour something through it.  As I'm leaning on a lower fence that is relatively close to the wolves (you get about 2 foot from a wolf separated by a wire fence and some thorn bushes), I can see out of to the corner of my eye, I see liquid, like a stream, falling from above, falling in a big splash right next to a wolf who just so happens to be the alpha of the pack. Curious, I look up, and see Rich Lady, standing on the boardwalk, looking down with a cup in her hand. The day is relatively slow, so I decide to go deal with her.\n\nI walk up the boardwalk, to where the woman is, making sure she doesn't see me. I should take this time to point out that in order to kick someone out, I have to meet certain criteria. The first one is that I have to witness her committing an act that disturbs or can possibly harm the animal. Second is that I have to verbally warn her at least once. Third is that I have to tell her why it's harmful. Seems pointless and a little wasteful of time, but I don't make rules, I just enforce them.\n\nAs I approach her, she still has yet to see me. Perfect, I'm thinking. If I watch her do it, there's no way she can deny it.\n\n Or so I thought. \n\nThe gods of family entertainment security smiled upon me, and she did it again. This time, she hit the wolf. And Alpha was pissed. Alpha hops up, growls, then barks a warning of “Knock it the fuck off”. This startled the woman so much, she drop her cup over the fence, but not into the exhibit, as the second fence catches the cup and rolls it into the abyss below.\n\nGotcha now.\n\nI walk up to her and tap her lightly on the shoulder. She turns to face me, seemingly relieved. \n\nRL: Oh good, an employee. I dropped my cup down there, can you go get it? \n\nMe: Actually ma'am. I saw you drop your cup into the exhibit after pouring something on the wolf below you. Can you explain why you did it? \n\nRL: What do you mean? I didn't pour anything.\n(Cue bad lying face on her part)\n\nMe, in my head: Christ this is gonna be annoying.\n\nMe, to woman: Ma'am, I watched you pour it. I watched the wolf get up, growl, and then bark at you.\n\nWoman: No! I was just standing here, and your wolf jumped up and started barking at me. It scared me so much I dropped my cup. \n\nMe: Ma'am. I know you're lying to me. I'm not going to kick out for it right now, but if you keep lying to me, I will. Do you know that when you startle the animal it can cause them serious issues with their blood pressure and stress levels (kind of a lie, kind of not. Two can play at this game.)?\n\nRL: But he looked hot! I figured he wanted some water. \n(Ha ha. Got you now.)\n\nMe: So you admit you poured water on the wolf?\n\nYou ever give someone such damning options, that their brain short-circuits trying to process the information? That was this lady for a solid 10 seconds. After resetting, she puts on an angry face and half-says half-yells that she wants my supervisor. I key up my radio.\n\nMe: MTWD to Supervisor.\n\nSupervisor: Go ahead.\n\nMe: Guest is requesting you here at the wolves after being confronted about harassing an animal.\n\nSupervisor, with a sound of defeated resignation: 10-4, enroute. \n\nMe: Copy, thanks. \n\nMe, to woman: She's on her way. \n\nAfter a few minutes, my radio pipes up again. \n\nSupervisor: MTWD, come in. \n\nMe: Go ahead.\n\nS: Be advised, director is en route to you.\n\nDamn it. \n\nMe: Copy.\n\nThe whole time while I'm waiting, the woman continues to berate me by saying “how dare I accuse her” and that “she'll have my badge by tomorrow”. Great, she's one of these people. \n\nFinally, my director, with my supervisor in tow, approaches us. My director asks me what happens and I tell him. He then thanks me for my action and says he can handle it from here. Whatever you say boss.\nI walk over to my direct supervisor, who is standing there, curious about what happened.\n\nS:  So what happened?\n\nMe: She poured water on a wolf and I caught her. I confronted her and she got defensive. Why is the director here?\n\nS: He wanted to see what was going on, I guess. I don't know, I just work here. (Always a great thing to hear from a supervisor)\n\nMe: Fair enough, I guess.\n\nAfter they talk for a few minutes, the director shakes her hand, and she's smiling. Wait, what. \n\nHe approaches me and my supervisor, tells us that he assures she won't do it again. I start to ask why she wasn't kicked out, but my supervisor stops me before I can and says yes sir, walking away, motioning for me to follow. \n\nI later find out this woman is a donor to the zoo, and my director knows her well. So much for fairness to all customers,\n\nI saw this lady multiple times after the incident, and she was oddly cordial, but I could tell she resented me, because how dare I protect the animals she pays to feed from her. \n\nMoral of the story: Apparently, you can pay enough money to harass animals in cages and not be kicked out. \n\nTl, dr: Woman pours water on wolf, gets away with it because she's rich. C’est la vie \n\nEDIT: Formatting\n",

        "text": "This memory was brought up today, figured I would share. Occured 2 years ago.\n\n\nSo I was once hired to watch an individual apartment. The problem was a specific crackhead for unknown reasons has broken into the unoccupied apartments a couple times. He's done it enough and he's so fucking regular they hired my company to stop/catch him. The manager of the community is really cool guy, he said we are welcome to use the unit to watch movies and play games. The unit had 8 months until the last tenants were out and they could do major work of some kind, so all but 3 units out of 16 or so in the building itself were empty. My approach to this post was to watch movies on the porch that basically looks at the only entrance. \n\nAfter 2 weeks of nothing, I'm watching a movie on the porch and I see a man... Walking like only crackheads do... Walking up towards the building. He is walking right at me. I put my laptop under me, stand up, and greet him. \n\nCrackhead: \"What are you doing here these are empty.\" \n\nPaladenConnery: \"I'm hired security, here to stop the problems going on.\"\n\nCrackhead: \"you cant stop shit, rent-a-cop\" and I'll spare you, He just curses at me and walks up close to me. I'm 6'6\" 300lbs, roughly. He approached aggressively but once he got close he wouldn't come near me. I think he didn't realize how big I was until he was talking to me. \n\nThe guy kinda ignores me and kicks a door to an empty unit until it breaks inward. He did it in 4 kicks. He did it in front of me to prove I can't stop him, or didn't want to stop him, or whatever. The second he turned away from me I called the cops, they said stay on the phone blah blah. They have all my info I'm just waiting for a unit. The guy walks out of the unit he just broke into and is holding what looks like a weapon of some kind. I put my cell phone in my pocket and the guy comes up to me. He was holding drywall, he punched through drywall ripped it out and was holding some of it that looked like a weapon. I did not communicate what I saw to the dispatcher, I did not want to give false info regarding a weapon. \n\nHe walks up to me drywall in hand and is saying the apartment community ripped him off... And also I'm a piece of shit for being security. \n\nPaladenConnery: \"Why am I a piece of shit?\" \n\nI troll him. \"What did they do?\" and he spends like fucking 10 minutes ranting about how they ripped him off because he didn't fix his unit before he left. something. Whatever. \"That's not what I heard\" and I made up a completely fabricated story. It had nothing to do with him, I was just telling a story with no point or aim except saying \"but hold on, this comes around, trust me, then...\" constantly. He kinda got smart and started walking away until I brought the story back to him. \"They said you also broke the sign out front\" - the sign wasn't broken, hasn't been broken, and has nothing to do with anything. This triggers another 10 minute rant about how they are lieing scum. His story wraps up with \"and your just a fucking rentacop bitch\" blah blah blah you get the idea. He said \"you just saw me and you didn't stop me, your not even arresting me, because you cant!\" \n\nSo while he's talking, there's two officers on foot walking up behind him. They're coming at a steep angle, in the dark, in black, pretty stealthy. They parked at the wrong building and walked over. He's yelling and doing the \"you can't do anything\" rant. \"I can't arrest you but your dumb enough to talk to me.\" was the last thing I said to him before the cops got his attention and took him without struggle... Not without yelling but without struggle. In hindsight I wanted a cool catch phrase but couldn't think of one. I was just amazed that trolling him worked for so fucking long. Dispatch was on my phone for 48 minutes of me trolling him before I hung up. \n\nI'm trying to remember what story I told him, all I remember is it started with an imaginary person living in the unit before him, it was completely fabricated but it held his attention. I kept telling him it had to do with his situation and I guess it did what it needed to do, stall.\n\nHe never saw me place the call, so I guess he felt safe hanging around and talking to me...",

        "text": "Just a short one here.  At one point I worked as a deupty, and moonlighted as a security guard at various public functions.  Mostly city stuff where we helped out with the standard security, and local PD.  \n\nIn any case, during one particular event, I've got a raging head cold due to the weather and pollen; and I'm sneezing about every five or six minutes, give or take.  While patrolling along the beer tent area, I get word that there's something weird going on over by the porta johns.  So I meander my way over there, only to find several of our usual drunks huddled in a circle and looking at this other fellow, who I'll call \"Dave\".  (not his name, but the guy looked like a Dave to me.) \n\nDave is completely shit faced drunk, stripped down to his boxers, and standing in front of one of those porta johns...kicking it.  Every minute on the dot, Dave kicks the door of this thing.  Thunk.  Thunk.  Thunk.  Thunk...  You get the picture.\n\nNow Dave wasn't overly dangerous by any stretch of the imagination, or least far as I could tell.  He was just drunk, and pissed, and taking things out on the poor plastic toilet which had done nothing to him.\n\nWalking over to Dave, I gently tap him on the shoulder to get him to turn to face me, and ask what's up.  Problem is, about the time I get him to turn, I feel this massive sneeze coming on, and before I can stop it I let loose.  Dave freezes.  Everyone freezes.  A couple ladies screamed, and some poor guy starts vomiting on himself.\n\nAll because of a sneeze?  I mean it felt wet, I did manage to get my hand over my nose, and Dave...well he's gone white as a sheet and starts apologizing before grabbing his shirt and trying to press it up to my face.\n\nNaturally I try batting him away, only to have him say, in perhaps the most sober manner \"Dude...you're bleeding!\"\n\nI'm...what?!\n\nCheck my hand and see it's covered in blood, as is the top of my uniform.  Reluctantly I take Dave's shirt and press it to my face.  Dave, for his part walked with me to the medical tent, acting like a very drunk mother hen.\n\nTurned out that when I'd sneezed, I broke a blood vessel and had sprayed a nosebleed out onto my hand.  It actually could have been worse, as the medics said, since a whole lot of blood came out.  Even blew out a vein or something in my eye, turning IT red.\n\nAs for Dave?  I kinda felt bad for him.  Gave him a warning, and had someone grab a spare T shirt out of my cruiser's trunk (one of my workout shirts, honestly) to give him.  He got a warning for being drunk in public, and admonished to put his jeans back on, and to give the porta john a rest.\n\nCouple days later, while dealing with another drunk (not Dave), I had the guy look at me and say fearfully \"Please sir...don't bleed on me!\"\n\nCue facepalm.\n\nI never did quite live that down, though I did see Dave again the next year.  Never did find out why he was kicking the porta john though.  ",

He had a death grip on the door frame next to us, but I eventually took him down and by that time my assistance arrived. We put cuffs on and pulled him up and walked/dragged him outside. \n\nI asked him what on earth he was thinking, and he said \"I wanted to know why you aren't helping anybody.\" I looked at him and said \"well sir, next time all you gotta do is ask. Now you're going to jail.\" The police arrived and asked if I wanted to press charges, to which I responded \"absolutely!\". They took my info and took him downtown. \n\nThis whole incident was honestly more bizarre than anything. I've seen patients lose it on staff and security, but there's usually some sort of build up to it. This guy literally woke up, walked over and attacked me. You just never know what somebody is thinking.\n\nBe safe everyone. ",

        "text": "I have a story that happened a couple months ago..\nMy background is in operations management for security, however I started in the industry at bars/events before I was even legally allowed to be in a bar. \n\n   Now, I moved back to Edmonton for work (not security work). I was walking to the gym in the Brewery district when I had noticed a male individual acting frantically and shouting/talking to himself. So, I pulled my headphones out, slowed my pace and kept my distance. I noticed while shadowing him that a \" security\" officer was coming out of one of the stores ahead.  I tried to grab his attention , but his sweet sun glasses may have been distorting his vision.  In any case the S/O comes to realization on his own that his individual needs to be talked to and calmed down, and he approaches the male. I hang around to ensure that the S/O noticed the male had mental issues and would approach him as such, I've seen all too many times that aspect gets over looked in the initial read of a situation.\n  \n    So, the S/O begins with \" Hey sir, I Just need you to quiet down please\" , I am thinking Great! he can tell about his mental issues and is going about this the right way. Thennnnnn, the male says \" go fuck yourself\" and the S/O replies with \" HEY YOU GET ON THE FUCKING GROUND YOU'RE UNDER ARREST\" and I am just like ohhhhh great.\n   So, the S/O cooks it over and grabs the male to try and subdue this guy and place him on the ground in the middle of traffic, they're both banging into cars as the S/O is getting thrown around etc etc ( The S/O may be 125 lbs straight out of the cop shop wannabe course ) So, I walked over grabbed the males right arm, put it behind his back and dropped him to the ground , held the guys wrist while the S/O attempted to handcuff but was shaking and yelling profanities still. I then grabbed the handcuff and placed it on one wrist and the S/O grabbed the other. Meanwhile, the male on the ground is crying and I am trying to comfort the guy who's obviously having a mental breakdown. \n\n     As I got up and brush off the dirt and stuff I walk over to the sidewalk and look around to ask about writing a report or statement etc etc.....I look up to see the S/O is already down the street with the Male and didn't even say a word of thanks or anything to acknowledge my assistance....So, I just continued to the gym and worked out. \nPopped into the office the following day, and the guy didn't even recognize me, he thought I was a bystander, when I clarified he just said oh...thanks and stood there. Pretty young dude, I can't believe they allow him to be alone in this district. Anyway, that was a Thursday evening on the way to the gym for me. \n\n\nEdit : I should clarify , I'm not in Edmonton for security work, this was purely just something that happened while I was walking to the gym from my car.

        "text": "I worked security for 3 years about 2 years ago. I didn't know this sub existed, and *boy do I have tales!*\n\nI picked up being an S/O because I was temporarily out of a job and bills don't give a shit about that. My husband was also an S/O (he ranked above me), but it was rare we worked together (conflict of interest and all).\n\nThe company worked alongside bouncers at a urban nightclub on Fridays and Saturdays. The bouncers can throw people out, and since we man the outside entrance, we prevent them from going in. We are also stationed inside at the doors (multiple entryways for fire codes and performers) and do preliminary crowd control and/or act like a bouncer if needed.\n\nAnyway - it's New Year's Eve and the club is **hopping**. Like, asshole to armpit packed. Probably against fire code for occupancy, but this client pays well for special events so unless major shit goes down, we keep it hush-hush.\n\nThe whole evening is full of live (popular) performers, and I am backed against a door. Now, I worked armed security so I had on a full duty belt, and armed S/O's know how it feels to be \"trapped\". It isn't a good feeling. We have radios, but without an earpiece (I had one, some other S/O's didn't) it's really hard to communicate. We heavily rely on visual contact around the club to check on our fellow S/O's.\n\nOne of my S/O's is around a corner so I finally make my way over to check on him and all I see are flashes of uniform, and about 4-5 other people around him. I call for backup, and push my way to the scene. As I get there, my eyes sting and water and the tell-tale sign of OC spray hits my nose. \n\n**The S/O sprayed someone in a densely packed night club**\n\nWell, this was a shit storm. Being female, I yelled (it was loud) for the women to back off so I can see what's going on. They angrily do so, but yell that \"he's hurting her\", and she \"didn't do anything but stagger into him\".\n\nOk, cool, cool, but lemme get this mass of appendages separated so I can assess what's what. Finally, the S/O (let's call him K) notices me and yells he needs her cuffed because she's \"belligerent.\" I put my hand up (ok, I understand, back off so I can do this gesture) and he let's her go.\n\nNow, this is a *big girl*. I'm talking 400+ pounds. She's *strong*, too. He's about 5'6\" and athletic, but this girl was giving him a run for his money. If you fellow S/O's are also familiar with cuffing techniques, you know that you need more than one set to provide slack for larger patrons. I have 2, so I tell her I'm securing her for both of our sakes and we will go outside where I will let her go and we can talk. She agrees, and by that time there are 4 other S/O's who saw the mess and came to assist.\n\nI go ahead, to part the crowd, and two S/O's take up the woman, one on either side. There's a set of 3 steps leading down to the main floor. The S/O's didn't tell the half-blinded-by-OC patron about them. Down she goes, face first.\n\nJesus what a mess.\n\nI turn back to see both of the S/O's *lifting her up by her arms*, pulling her shoulders back, as she starts screaming. I get right in their faces and ask them what kind of fucking twat ever taught them that, and to assist her properly. We finally get her up and outside, where I got some water, uncuffed her, and started helping her detox from the OC.\n\nWhat the friend's said about her was true: she accidentally bumped into K, who decided she was \"trying to attack him\", which led him to spray her. As she was trying to put her hands out to stop the spray, she cuffed him on the chin. That started the whole brawl.\n\nI called the patrol supervisor at the time (who is my husband), gave him a run down of the situation, and started talking to the PD who also arrived (they hang out in the area because easy DUIs after the club closes).\n\nThe patron ended up going in an ambulance (just to be checked over for injuries), my husband, the patrol supervisor, dressed down K and fired him on the spot, the PD ran the report up the security company's line far enough that K lost his ACT 235 (he can't carry armed anymore on duty), and the friends of the patron promised to sue the company (they never did).\n\nSorry, that was long.\n\nTell me your tales of stupid, incompetent co-workers.",

Well for the past 4 days we have been tagging the vehicle since it was in the wrong parking spot in a lot and taking up an assigned spot of a home owner. Then our maintenance tagged it with one of our stickers for being in the way while they got new lines painted for parking. Finally got the property manager to agree to getting it towed. Calls local tow company and gave them vehicle plate, description, and location, and told them it's got all the bright orange stickers on it. \n\nI reported to the site the next day and within an 20 min of starting my shift (not enough time to make a complete patrol) I get a call from a very angry resident (we will call him T) about his car being stolen. I was like oh this must be the guys care we towed. \nMe:Sir do you own a grey Honda. \n\nT:Yes.\n\nMe:Oh we had it towed due to you parking in a spot assigned to another resident. There were multiple warning stickers placed on the vehicle.\n\nT:My car was in my driveway.\n\nMe:?? What is your address\n\nT:2111 (or something. Belongs to an actual house with a driveway not the townhouses that use a common lot.)\n\nMe:?? Sir I'm going to check something and call you right back, I believe your car was towed by accident.\n\nSure enough on the other side of the community still in the parking lot sat the grey Honda with all the stickers still on it. Explained that the tow company towed the wrong vehicle, even picked him up and drove him to the vehicle that was supposed to be towed. \n\nAftermath: he called the tow company and we both spoke to the manager. He apologized for the mix up but said he could not return the car until the proper one was towed (which I supervised). And the resident would have to come get it they can't bring it back. He had to call his wife who had to leave work to take him to get the car. I don't know the outcome but he filed a civil suit with the tow company. \n\n",

It's the equivalent of eating extra Sloppy Joes while using the latest in laptop technology as a plate. Any halfway competent insurer will tell you it's a bad bet.\n\nThirdly, it's hot out even in the shade, the car and thus the A/C is off, the window is partially down but not nearly enough and there's no water in the car. Any halfway competent dog owner will tell you that is a recipe to kill your dog. \n\nNow I've been a guard for a while and have occasionally been frustrated by my fellow guards but damn if I didn't feel outright murderous. After about half an hour of waiting by the car without jerk arriving, and making sure the dog is doing alright, I get the go ahead to get the jerk's info and send it up the line where my dog-loving supervisors gleefully call his company. A couple concerned contractors and tenants also call it in. I obsessively check the car and make sure Fido (Fidette?) is okay and mull over if I can borrow a crowbar from my building's engineer if I need to smash  windows. It would probably cost me my job, and possibly a couple limbs if it's an attack dog. That being said, I grew up with a dog and who needs money? Or arms?\n\nAlas, I wasn't there for it, but the car was gone shortly after the call. I'd like to think that I would've given jerk a friendly grin and one fingered wave while the tenants went on the offensive with their high heels and scalding hot coffee.",

        "text": "Hey all,\n\nSo I used to hold a security position in a small data center. Lovely place, 3 floors large and beautiful layout. It was built into a large hill that sat in front of a convenience store and some other shops.\n\nThe Data center itself was loud, but not too loud I couldn't hear anything. The nights were long and when I'd grown tired of Minecraft and youtube, I would throw the heater on and doze, as it was the end of winter and no one ever came to this secluded area. \n\nOne night after a long game of Minecraft and Dominos, I lean back and take a look at our cameras as I did every few minutes. Sometimes, I would spot a deer outside. Sometimes, employee's came in early or late. But this time, I saw someone on the side of the building that is against the hill, wearing a hoodie and peering in. \n\nOut of sheer panic, I quickly jumped up from my seat and contemplated my choices. Go look for this person or sit in the safety of my room. Go out? stay here. Go out? Stay here. \n\nI chose to go.\n\nWith my flashlight on my phone turned on and 911 ready to be dialed, I ventured out into the 3 AM darkness and called for anyone who may have been there. After about 15 minutes of nervous wandering, I returned back to my security room and stared at the cameras for a long while before finally calming down. Maybe I was tired and just seeing things?\n\nI told my boss in the morning and he said they'd look into it.\n\nFast forward to the next week (I worked weekends), and I was told that they didn't see anything on the tapes. We laugh it off and decide I was just exhausted as back then, there were 2 days where I only had 3 hours of sleep scheduled. 2 jobs and school kept one busy.\n\nThat night, I'd again indulged in my Dominos feast and started to doze due to the food coma it placed me in. I had an alarm set for every 15 minutes, so I could check everything an be sure I never fell too far into my sleep.\n\nDue to this, I was awoken suddenly by a very shrill, screeching alarm. Grabbing the work phone, I dialed up my bosses one by one until they answered, trying to figure out what had set that alarm off and what suite it was coming from in our building. Turns out it was our Burglar alarm. Someone had tried going into the windows that had been peeked into last week, and I had missed them in the 15 minutes I'd looked away.\n\nBy the time I had gotten to the room, there was no damage and no one was there. This happened the next night as well. I just went in, shut the alarm off, and wondered why I decided to do this job for not enough pay at this point. \n\nDid I also mention that this is a newly renovated building with lots of big, empty rooms and disheveled furniture? \n\nI didn't stay at that job much longer, but I do miss it occasionally. I was always exhausted, but I got paid to be at ease (mostly). Got caught up on school work, too. \n\n",

There were skateboarders who didn't know it wasn't a skate park. \n\nAnyways, this is a scenario that could've been avoided with confirmation &amp; knowing that people grow old but not quickly.\n\nThe previous day of this scenario, a TEEN was banned from a mall property's anchor resturant, let's call it #ASPORTSGRILL, for some stupid shit. I arrived just as my coworkers were done assisting in said ban right before the ban subject left.\n\nI was the only S/O from the previous day &amp; we got a call from #ASPORTSGRILL saying that the banned suspect was back &amp; they needed assistance with contacting her. I was the only one that knows who the banned suspect is, so I advise the security dispatch I was en route. \n\nI get there &amp; I'm just looking for the manager &amp; I meet eyes with a woman, who had to be like fucking late 40s, so let's call her $F-40, &amp; then look to the back of the place. $F-40 then says \"Hello?!\". I reply \"Hi\" give a slight wave then walk to the manager, who we'll call $What'sAge, who thanks for me for coming &amp; now says, \"Yeah that's her.\" And the conversation was formed as follows: (we'll call me: $Me)\n\n$Me: \"That's who?\n\n$What'sAge: \"That's who I called about, she can't be here.\"\n\n- I slowly squint my eyes due to being perplexed about this &amp; then realizing the absurdity-\n\n$F-40: \"Why can't I be here? Why you eyeballing me before you talk to him?\"\n\n$Me: \"I noticed you were looking at me when I was seeking the manager &amp; waited to see if you needed assistance from me &amp; realized you didn't, apologize for the awkwardness.\"\n\n$What'sAge: \"Maa'm you need to leave, we told you yesterday you weren't allowed here.\" \n\n$F-40: \"I wasn't here yeterday, I live in (town 1 1/2 hrs away), I'm coming through with my family on a trip\n\nYou're saying I was here? I wouldn't choose to just come all the way up here.\n\nMy kids were hungry so we stopped. Why would I be here if I didn't have to?\"\n\n$Me: \"I think there's confusion here-\"\n\n-Getting stubborn as shit- $What'sAge: \"I saw you here, you can't be here, go, security can confirm it!\"\n\n$Me: \"Yeah.......that's not her.\"\n\n-A soulcrushing gaze- $What'sAge: \"You're sure?.... Check her ID.\"\n\n$F-40: \"Here have a look\"\n\n I look at I.D. \n\n$Me: \"Yep. A different person.\"\n\nSummarizing the following: the lady gets more pissed at the manager, cancels her order &amp; takes her kids. My coworkers just show up, stop her, they recieve her anger now, but then says to me\n\n\"I know you doing your job, you good I was mad but not at you anymore.\"\n\nA relief. (sarcasm) She leaves &amp; I tell my coworkers (outside of the establishment after saying with a subtly of spite: \"If you need anymore assistance, give a call\")\n\n\"This motherfucker Age Illiterate or fucking Age Blind cause she's 47. She probably remembers the New Wave era crystal clear. Banned person is like 16 &amp; doesn't have any haggard skin upon her skull.\"  \n\n\nTL;DR: A teen was banned from a restaurant, manager calls next day says it's said teen, it's not it's an older lady who can not pass for a teen, I've shown up for no reason after being in screaming then finally receiving a blunt but genuine acknowledgement of doing a job.

That changed. \n\nIn that post i mentioned i wasn't being paid. \n\nThis has changed. \n\nI was working the graveyard shift when i hear we have a CO. Is coming in to do routine trimonthly inspection (this involves checking for faults, mishaps etc) \n\nIts about 3am. And im sitting on guard duty. In this small hut at the end of the dock and i get a tap on the security hut. \n\nHe asks me what im doing and i tell him. Im waiting for a shipment.\n\nHe asks me how things are. I tell him exactly how it is. \n\nLong story short:\n\nI don't have to work on days off unless its a alarm. \n\nIf i work overtime i MUST be paid by law. (That's what he said- thanks to the person who pointed this out! So i could tell him) \n\nThings look better. Probably wont be. At least im being paid now. \n\nPersonally, I would like to thank all of you from my last post who gave me advice. \n\nI will let you know if anything changes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
