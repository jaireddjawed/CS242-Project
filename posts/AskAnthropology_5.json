I don't want to make any appeals to notions of cultural complexity, or anything of the sort, but a lot of the activities of Indigenous peoples of the American Southwest entailed cooperation and organization of large arrays of people.\n\nI cannot find anything online regarding forms of governance, or how resources and labor were allocated, amongst any of these groups, but I am curious as to what forms of authority existed in these societies and how this impacted the organization of resources and labor. Any insight into this question would be greatly appreciated.",

Also, what would be a good STEM minor that might be helpful for anthropology?",

        "text": "So to give some context, I have been reading on histories of various peoples and places. Often times, the landscape is talked about, but never in too much detail. For example, I'm reading a book on the history of Himalayan cultures, and while it's wonderful for learning about the people and cultures, I find it so hard to visualize their relationship to the geographic environment. A town might be talked about, and the position on a map might be given (and thus, the vague idea of the geographical terrain), but I have a hard time understanding what that means in reality (having never lived in similar conditions). When a city is \"high in the mountains\", or \"in the ____ river valley\" or some other such descriptor, I find it hard to actually imagine what that actually looks like.\n\nI realize that these sorts of descriptions are adequate for the given literature's scope/purpose, but I personally have a hard time getting through them, when my mind is preoccupied with figuring out exactly how it looks and feels for the people in question. I can't really put my thoughts into a concise request, but here are some broad questions that get at my curiosities/uncertainties:\n\n- Where did people live and not live? How did the culture(s) conceive of their geography, and what part did the geography play in their lives?\n\n- What kinds of structures were built, and how was the choice of size, shape, materials, position, layout, etc constrained/affected/influenced by, or adapted to, the geography?\n\n- What was the subsistence method(s) of the people, and how was that constrained/affected/influenced by, or adapted to, the geography?\n\n- What does the geography even look and feel like? What are the salient features that play a role in human life? What parts of the geography pose what kinds of challenges (and benefits)?\n\n- How was large-scale, inter- and intra-cultural human interaction conducted in this particular geographical context? How were methods of communication, transport, etc constrained/affected/influenced by, or adapted to, the geography?\n\nJust to clarify, I am aware that all of the above questions will be highly dependant on all sorts of non-geographical factors; my inquiries are as to these aspects in the specific context of their geography. These are all questions that would pertain to any temporal, cultural, and geographic context; my specific interest is in mountainous geography, rainforest geography, and desert geography. Anything about cultures/peoples within those contexts are what I'm most interested in. But any work in general that is geography focussed, I would appreciate.\n\nThanks.",

Sometimes there is only one hot spring, geyser or caldera for hundreds of kilometres.\n\nOther than heating, uses of primitive geothermal energy could be:\n\n* Hot springs/bathing\n* Sterile drinking water\n* Hangi-style cooking\n* Easy fire making\n* Constant warmth in cold weather\n\nIn prehistoric times, did having this easily available energy in their territories have considerable effects - especially in terms of economy and technology - on a tribe?\n\nEven more interesting would be to know what effect this was compared to similar peoples who did not have \"stone-age geothermal\" power in their territories - such as may have happened on neighboring islands in Polynesia.",

It seems the only type of evolving that has happened to Homo sapiens since the beginning of humanity has just been us evolving a range of different features that come from different ethnicities/ parts of earth, and not a dramatic change in our overall form. It doesn’t seem like any major changes will happen to our form anymore because we have reached a point where we have pretty much everything we need. So back to my question, are we in the perfecting stage now where slight changes will take place due to our modern lifestyle? Will leg and pubic hair eventually stop growing as most females shave it consistently throughout their lives? Will certain features be favored and passed down over the years pertaining to our beauty standards? Will we begin to physically age less as we get older? Will Ai become a part of our bodies?

Having lived in various countries, I can see different and contradictory concepts of how we place value on what we create or sell.

        "text": "Hey guys,\n\nI know for some people a question like this might be \"obvious\" but for me, it is a bit more intricate. Let me break it down.\n\nI have noticed that musicians do not always but many times tend to write about a specific city and use slang from that city. They also tend to talk about happenings that are specific to their city, in the period in which they lived. The easiest example for me is Artic Monkeys they write about their lives in Sheffield. They talk about the worries, concerns, and aspirations of the people of Sheffield, at least in some of their albums they do.\n\nThis is all perfectly fine and makes sense. I'd like to add that their local fans are very protective, not only of Artic Monkeys but also of similar bands which write about their hometowns. Were they believe that the lyrics are very specific and only have One meaning which should be interpreted through the lenses of the culture where the album was made in?\n\nThis again also makes sense but only under certain conditions. If we interpret a work by Artic Monkeys to be a culturally specific product that is meant to be consumed by the people of Sheffield. And maybe England at large, given how Sheffield is in England, people who are from the same country might be related to each other. Then it makes sense if Artic Monkey or a similar band, make their album for their audience.\n\nYet, groups like Artic Monkeys do tour many other places even when they weren't that famous. Let's say Canada. Here they have the same Language(English speaking) and somewhat similar culture. But I can bet that teenagers and young adults in Canada are slightly different than in Sheffield and have different aspirations, concerns, and desires. However, given that they share a similar language it is possible for them to \"culturally decode\" the Artic Monkeys' work.\n\nAt the same time, Artic Monkeys are also touring other European countries like France, Germany, and Spain. Here most people don't speak the same language as they do, and don't share the same culture either. Hence, why would Artic Monkeys play at a venue there? Especially, since their product is not meant to be \"Universalist\" but rather \"Localist\"?\n\nI'll go even further imagine you are a young adult in Madrid and you are hearing the Artic Monkeys concert. Even if you speak English fluently you might and likely misinterpret the lyrics. Simply by virtue of not being from Sheffield. You don't speak the Sheffield slang nor are you familiar with the surroundings like the bars from Sheffield. You might be able to relate to it and say, \"Well, I've been to bars around Madrid, hence my experiences might be similar or analogous to the one's the arctic monkeys had.\" Yet if you meet the Artic Monkeys fans from Sheffield they might tell you that's not what the lyrics mean they are very specific.\n\nHence, how could you be a fan of something you can't understand or related to?\n\nI'll even go further and ask how could you be a fan of something that was not meant for you.\n\nWhy would Artic Monkeys tour all these other countries if they wanted their lyrics to only be interpreted a single way?",

But European and West Asian people mixed freely with North Africans, which is why they look physically distinct from the rest of Africa (please correct me if i'm mistaken). \n\n\nDuring the green Sahara period when the Sahara desert didn't exist, was there gene flow from Europe/West Asia into sub Saharan Africa? Do we have any genetic evidence of this happening?",

As a part of my research I’m taking into consideration spiritual experiences of the mankind - as I believe that this topic is not explored enough in the modern science. If you choose to help me possibly discover something and make an impact - I’d be forever grateful.

I am just scared because I know the job market for people with only a bachelor's in anthro is pretty limited. I am also thinking of getting a data science minor and I was wondering if anyone could give me insight on whether those would mesh well. I would love to go into academia too but would like to get a real job utilizing my degrees for a while before going to grad school and I thought that maybe a data science minor would also complement it. Any help would be appreciated.",
