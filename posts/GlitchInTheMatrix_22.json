        "text": "So this happened to me yesterday. Bit of backstory, when my family and I moved into our new house (6 years ago) I packed up most of my childhood toys into a bag and they went into a wardrobe in the spare room. However, I left a few of them out. These ones I kept in my room as they had some more sentmental value. I placed them on the top shelf of my wardrobe so I could see them everyday. I would see these toys every day for 6 years.   \nThat changed yesterday. I had a dream the previous night about one of those toys, when I woke up I thought \"Huh, that was odd\". Then went to have a shower, when I got back to my room I opened my wardrobe to get same clothes, still thinking about that dream, I looked up and I noticed that toy was missing, in fact, all of them were missing. I was confused, I've had these toys in here for 6 years, I remember seeing them everyday, i've accidently knocked them down more times than I could count. So I got dressed and started looking for them.  \nI went to the spare room wardrobe and noticed everything seemed out of place. I was in here the other day looking for my suit, so I remember what it looked like. I start going through the bag where I kept the other toys and there I found them, But not on the top of the pile, closer to the bottom, so It's not like someone grabbed them than just threw them in the bag. To get them there someone would have had to put them in before all the others.  \nI was so confused, how did they get there? I know I never put them there, I asked my mother if she had moved them there or something, she just laughed at me and said I was paranoid.  \nDid I move to some alternate reality where I never kept those toys out? or is something else going on? I grabbed those toys and put them back in their original place.  \n",

ALL the suitcases are by the door, we are loading them into the trunk of the car, and before the last one goes, I take off the hoodie and put it on top of everything else in the purple suitcase. We load that one last, and off we go.\n\nWe stop for a couple of potty breaks, but that's it. We get to the new place 9 hours later and bring all my stuff into my new apartment. It's chilly now, so I open the purple suitcase to get my new fave hoodie and it's gone. I empty the suitcase in the middle of the empty room, and spread everything out, and it's not there. I empty every single suitcase and do the same. It's not there.\n\n10 months later, my parents sell the house. We moved every last stick of furniture out of the house, but the hoodie was never seen again.",

        "text": "When the iPhone came out I distinctly remember not buying it and waiting 2 months to purchase an unlocked Android device from Craigslist to use in Cellular One. It had a small brown folder button on the homescreen and a web browser. The version was like Android 0.9 and it had Copy and paste and a text editor but non market.\n\nEventually I got sick of using it in and sold in for like 3x as much as I paid for it in October 2008 after using it for over a year and bought a BlackBerry instead that was much less limited but way less expensive as the iPhone.\n\nEither I:\n\n1) Obtained a prototype HTC Dream a full year before release (which seems improbable since at the time Android was more of a competitor to BlackBerry than iPhone\n\n2) Had some weird other HTC-Not-A-Sidekick phone that happened to be called Android but had a full HTML browser with pinch to zoom\n\n3) Had a future-device that found its way to me.\n\n4) Come from a timeline where a rushed HTC Android unlocked phone came to market right after the iPhone and I shifted after selling my device: and then popped into a universe where Obama was suddenly in the running for President with Biden. Everyone had posters with his face everywhere. What happened to him getting knocked out in the primaries and the Clinton-Sanders centrist-left ticket? Gone. The Republican ticket was suddenly McCain-Palin with Republicans far to the right instead of McCain-Feingold as a right-left unity ticket to deal with the Crash of 07. And the phone was the key.\n\nThe first thing that was wrong was that New Zealand seemed to be to the southeast of Australia instead of way to the northeast and wasn't used as a stopover station between Hawaii and Japan in WW2.\n\nBirth certificate. Passport. Wallet. Kitchen items. All there, though some stuff seemed to be in the wrong spot.\n\nTalked to a psychic who told me I \"exist in many dimensions\" and needed to do \"mindfulness meditation\" to bring myself \"down to Earth\". Talked to a psychiatrist who told me I had depression and anxiety.\n\nBut why was everything the same other than New Zealand, the phone, and the presidential candidates? Did the positioning of New Zealand have a slight ripple effect? Did my phone throw me off-kilter? Was it the beer I drank the night after selling the phone and buying my BlackBerry? Was I crazy?\n\nI kept it in until now. I kept that secret locked away. That I don't belong here. I'm not from here. I'm a lost traveler who slipped accidentally while drinking beer and discussing the theories of quantum physics with friends and about opening our minds.\n\nOne friend: we shall call her \"E\" remembers details the way I do. She thought she was crazy and had herself commited. That our beer was laced with something (we were both under 21 and bought it from someone on-campus)\n\nBut I remember. I remember the Bernstein Bears and Mandela dying in jail and having a middle school rememberence day for apartheid so we could feel what it was like to be him in jail as before he died, and to celebrate it while experiencing apartheid so we never became racists.\n\nI remember the empty missles that Russia and the US launched after the collapse of the USSR in 1996 as a joint excercise to show people just what a nuclear war would look like at the beginning and to frighten the public into accepting disarmament (and was ridiculed as an attempt to be a \"show of strength\" by Clinton).\n\nOther details all line up but the ones above. The SNES. The N64. My first laptop. The day my parents met and divorced and stepdad died. All the same.\n\nThen my hair rapidly fell out and I've been bald since. Multiple medical tests show I have extreme allergies like I am \"allergic to the planet.\"\n\nDoctors joke that I'm an alien.\n\nAm I?\n\nWhat happened to the me that was there? What happened to the me that was here?\n\n5) I misremembered a lot of things, had vivid childhood memories (from dreams), must have been paying more attention to college than to politics, and bought a phone that looked like Android and everything else is, like \"E\" said a delusion we both shared and that I was able to bypass and to overcome.",

A couple days ago I noticed the toy outside in my yard, which isn't unusual because the dog takes her toys outside. It has been raining a lot the past week, so I brought it inside so it wouldn't get any dirtier. But when I brought it in, the same toy was inside too. I don't understand how she could have got two. It's a fenced in yard, and she isn't allowed to leave the yard. I called my mother in law to confirm she only got one. It's really bugging me out. I'm guessing someone could have thrown it in the yard, but that's really weird and would be highly coincidental. The toys are only different because one has been outside in the rain a couple days and looks a little bit more ragged, but only slightly. \n\nPoo Doo with her toys:\nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/GwBMc",

However, they sent me screen shot that I had indeed called them at 6:39, BUT, My phone has no record of my phone calling them. All I have is the missed call from them and voicemail. How could I have called them if I didn't go to break until minutes later and my phone has no record of me every calling that number?

However a few months ago I went to watch something on Netflix, on my PS4 and it asked me to re-enter my username and password which is a pain.\n\nSo I said 'fuck it' and did something else. \n\nA while goes by, maybe a week, and I go to watch something again. However this time in the username field there is Pete's email address (which I didn't even have but discovered it was his through some trial and error in my contacts list.) Annnnnd Pete's password! So I log in as Pete and it doesn't even ask me if I want to make this a registered device, as if it already was Pete's device. So I text him what happened and he's gobsmacked as I am. \n\nExperienced some weird stuff on my playstations in the day, but this is the weirdest!\n\nHope everyone is having a good week!",

A couple of months ago, a friend of mine (whom lives in Virginia, I live in California), was visiting her friend who lives in Philadelphia, PA. When she was there, she called me frantically asking if I had facetimed her friend, because she noticed a missed call from my number on her friend's iPad. I have never met her friend, and I couldn't even tell you her name. I've only been to Philadelphia twice, and the last time was about four years ago. Her friend has no mutual friends with me. \n\nAfter initial freakouts, our first thought was that maybe my friend had been logged into her friend's iPad, and that her iCloud somehow synced up with it. However, we checked her iCloud account online a few days later and there was no other device other than her phone listed. Not only that, but I never Facetimed her, and there was no record of an outgoing Facetime call from my phone on or around that time. \n\nThis my first story coming from my phone. Please, if you have any ideas or explanations, let me know. I still regularly try to debunk this. \n\nThere is one more story related to my phone that happened about a month before that. \n\nOne night when I was working, I noticed two missed calls from my sister. When I got out of work, I called her back, only to hear her frantically saying \"thank god you're okay\". She told me after calling me the first time, she received a call from a different number, from someone claiming that they had my phone and in order for her to get it back, she would have to meet them in Brooklyn, New York. Remember, I live in California. \n\nNo incidents other than these, but still trippy enough to create some debate. ",

So the medication prilosec, acid reducer - it's trade name, or at least I thought it was, was Omneprazole - with an N after the M.  omNeprazole.  \n  \nI even remember when I was discussing the medication with my doctor, I had said I needed a refill of my \"om-knee-praz-ole\", laughing and saying I'm not sure how to pronounce this.  I clearly remember him saying \"oh, it's 'om-nep-rah-zahl', a lot of people can't say it!\"\n  \nSo I've lived with knowing the N.  Reminds [Berenstein Bears glitch](http://www.seventeen.com/celebrity/news/a32934/the-berenstein-berenstain-bears-conspiracy-theory/)\n  \nSo yesterday I go to the store to buy some over the counter.  I see the omeprazole and I'm like oh, weird.  Well that must not be it.  Hmm.  They must have it here SOMEWHERE.  Then I noticed ALL of the labels were omeprazole, without the n.  I thought hmmm they must have changed the name, that's so bizarre.\n  \nGot home and said well, I still have my old prescription bottle, I need to check that cause this is super odd and I couldn't be wrong (it was a higher dosage and I don't need that high of dose anymore, so I an just use the lower dose over the counter, so I still had the old prescription to check).  So I checked the bottle 100% certain it would have the n.  It didn't.  Totally FREAKED ME OUT.  Told my spouse about it.  Asked her how to say the medication regular name for \"prilosec.\"  she, too, said \"omneprazole.\"  I then showed her the bottle without the n and she, too, was like \"....whhhaaatttt\"\n  \nThis is crazy.  What's up with this?  Lol  It almost feels like I caught myself being on the Truman Show.  So bizarre.  Everywhere, though, online, it does not have the n.  WEIRD!",

        "text": "I have this story I've been telling for years about a run in the the police when I was a teenager. I was driving my car with three of my buddies in the car with me. I am white and they are all black. I used to tell the story when I was younger as my \"crazy run in with police\" story and later as my example of \"racial bias by police story\", but it was always the exact same story.\n\nWe're riding along and we see an unmarked police car and say \"Uh, oh 5-0\". The one buddy who was born in Belize is confused and doesn't know how we can tell so he hangs out the window looking at the car which causes them to pull us over. They get out in a huff until they see the white kid driving and then mellow out. They politely ask us to get out and if they can search the car. We're all good kids and have nothing to hide so I say, \"Sure\". They find nothing and ask me to open the trunk, which is broken. I tell them the only way to open it is with a knife or screw driver and I don't have one. One officer holds out a knife to me and says, \"Will this work?\". I hesitate thinking this is the okey doke and if I take it they're going to arrest me for possession of a weapon. All of my buddies are staring at me...but I take the knife. Nothing happens, I try to open the trunk with it and fail and they let us go. We all make jokes in the car about how it's good we hid the bodies in the trunk...\n\nOk, sorry for the long story but I thought it I just got to the point and left it out you guys would ask for the story so...to the point. I have told the story the same way for ever, I swear sometimes with the Belizean friend around. The other day I say something about it on FB and one of the guys who was with me says, \"I wasn't in the car and neither was \"so and so\", what are you talking about?\" He says he remembers the story but he wasn't there...and I feel completely lost. It's a vivid memory and the whole reason the story about racial bias and the craziness of a cop offering me a knife works, is that there were three black guys and me. How is it I've had this memory and been telling this story for over 20 years and it seems I've had it wrong all this time? ",

As summer comes around we begin to notice more and more road work popping up in various areas around the state I'm from. This year they decided the highway outside my appartment was a good place to start. ( Which fucking sucks for me.). With this it means I must wake up earlier because of traffic delays.  So everyday for the past 2 weeks I have had to wake up an hour earlier meaning I had to set my alarm back an hour. So here's where is gets bizzar yesterday on my way home from work I noticed there was no more road work.  I was fucking relived .  Not having to deal with that shit anymore.  So I get in the appartment and see my husband I start chatting it up with him and I say something along the lines of \" I'm so glad that road work is done with.\" You'll never guess what he says next.... \" What road work?\"  ...... I look at him angerly because I think he's just trying to piss me off.  He then genuinely says there was never any road work. So I started googling just to show him he's wrong, and prove he's just being an ass. Nothing, I found nothing about road work on the highway.  Ive sat in traffic there everyday for the last 2 weeks. I know there was road work.  I decided to drive out to the highway and see if there is any evidence of work being done, there was nothing done to the road no drill hold no paint indicating changes nothing the same old shitty concrete.   I'm baffled I couldn't of made a whole 2 weeks of time up.  This is not my reality.  I have one bit of evidence my alarm is still set an hour before I usually wake up. At least its somthing.  This is just to weird I'm loosing my mind over this.",

The room was located on the fifth floor of the building and I was sitting at a desk near the window doing my makeup. All of my makeup brushes are different (because they are used for different things) and I had them all lined up on the desk in front of me. I was using a specific brush to do my eyeshadow and set it down momentarily to grab a different brush. After I was done with that brush, I went to grab the eyeshadow brush I was originally using again, but it was gone. I looked through all of my brushes to make sure it had not just gotten mixed in with the others and searched all over the entire desk. I then got on the floor and looked all around the floor but couldn't find it. I explained what the brush looked like to my friends because it was a specific shape and looked different from all the other ones I had and they looked all around the surrounding area as well. We could not find it anywhere and I just came to the conclusion that maybe it had rolled off the desk and fell out the window (even though that didn't seem possible), I was just trying to make logic out of the situation. I gave up and sat back down to continue doing my makeup and, again, had all the brushes lined up in front of me. I was using the brush I had used right before the other went missing and when I set it down, I looked and saw that the missing eyeshadow brush was sitting right in front of me where I had originally left it. I freaked out and showed my friends that the brush was right there in front of me and they confirmed that when they looked through all my brushes, that one wasn't there. I have no idea where the brush went or how it got back on the desk and really don't know what to think about this. At this point I can only assume it was a glitch.\n\nTLDR; my makeup brush disappeared and reappeared where I had originally left it.",

        "text": "Hello there, I knew Reddit for couple of years but I found this sub yesterday. I want to share my story with you. It happened about 8 years ago. I'm a 35 years old anesthetist from Egypt. 8 years ago I was working in a small hospital in the rural City of Rosetta (if you know Rosetta Stone, this is the city where they found it). The hospital is formed of 5 floors. The dormitories are in the 5th floor. The ground floor had the emergency and causality department. Other floors have the wards, the labs and the operative theatre. At that time the hospital was under some maintainence. In that particular day I was on duty. There was nothing in the operative theatre that afternoon so I was in my room in the 5th floor surfing the web on my netbook. I heard some knocks on the door. It was the janitor, he told me that some new (beds and wardrobes) would be delivered now. He asked me to stay out of my room till they finish the replacement. I stayed in the TV room for a while when suddenly the PA system anounced my name to head immediately to ER. Before I move one security man came running and he told me that there was a big road traffic accident that involved a school bus and that every one available is needed down. I rushed to my room, found the new furniture in place so I closed it and ran down to the ER. When I entered the ER department I noticed the new color of the walls, before it was green now it's blue with silver decorations everywhere. While I was helping the children, I asked one nurse when did they change the colors of the ER, will all the hospital have the same pattern. She looked me confused and asked what new color, it was always like that. I got confused myself but I didn't pay attention to that. There was many injured children and some of them got burns due to the bus caught fire. There's were many doctors, pediatricians, surgeons etc. A lot of them were new faces to me. I was working in this place for several years so I almost knew everyone. I was asking myself when all those new people came. I should be more social and so but I didn't expect anything bad. I was asking the people I know about the new doctors and always I was getting the same answers: you don't know him?! how?! He was here for several years. We meet over lunch or dinner etc. Again I was confused but I didn't pay attention, many patients are waiting for my attention. A couple of hours later, everything is fine and things began to settle down. So I went outside the ER to have some fresh air. I won't forget what I saw. The hospital place is near the Nile (the Western branch, the Rosetta branch) so that's what I usually see when I leave the hospital. But what I saw was simply the Mediterranean. Rosetta City is near the Mediterranean but not that close. I couldn't believe my eyes. I began to look to the surrounding buildings. Some I knew, some I didn't. Now I freaked out, I remembered that I didn't recognize the ER or the new doctors. I ran inside to my colleagues and I asked them about what is out side they told me It's the Mediterranean. I shouted: I know it's but how did it come to here? Every one was confused. I kept asking where am I? And my colleagues started to calm me down and try to understand why the panic. I tried to call my parents (I was single at that time) using my cellphone but they didn't answer. I wanted to call another older anesthetist, I consider him a father and my best friend. I couldn't find his name on my phone. I really freaked out. I asked my colleagues for his phone number, every one told me that they don't recognize the name. I was sure that I wasn't dreaming, I was treating children calculating drug doses my mind was clear enough to know that I wasn't dreaming. I got a mental block, I didn't know what to do. Then I decided that I will leave the hospital at once, I need to see my family. I ran to the 5th floor to my room to change my clothes and get my things before I leave the place. Once I opened the room, I noticed the usual furniture .. no new furniture no new bed or wardrobe. I stood there for a moment totally lost. Then I heard some one calling me. It was a security guard, he told me that there is a big accident down that involved a lot of children and they needed everyone down there. I kept staring at him without any response. He kept talking that PA is down because of a faulty maintainence and that's​ why they are calling the doctors individually. I told him that I will go down ... He asked me If they is any other doctors in the dormitory? I told him that I Don't know so he went to check. I had a look out side the window and here it was the Nile and the usual scene. But I was already lost. I went down to help, the same children, same injuries but I was completely lost, confused and and hands shaking my legs barely carried me. My colleagues (usual daily group - no more new doctors) asked if I was OK and that I was pale. The next few days was like hell to me. I had nightmares. I wasn't able to think clearly during my day. Then I took one week off to calm down. I didn't have anything similar. I wasn't on any medications at that time or under any kind of stress. Everything was clear it wasn't a dream at all. I'm sure. Till today I still remember the children and what I did to them. I only told this story to this older anesthetist and later to my wife because whenever I remember it, I remember that horrible feelings I had. Since everyone here is sharing his story so I thought will tell it. May be you have an explanation.",

        "text": "This happened quite a while ago when I was younger. I feel like this subreddit is a good place to post this. \nBasically, when I was young, I had gotten very sick. Sick to the point where I was bedridden (or couch-ridden, in my case). My family would turn the couch around towards the window for me so I could lay in the sun, look out the window and get fresh air, etc. But apparently, I wasn't getting any better. A week or so of being sick is when it got weird. I remember laying on the couch, morning sun on my face. I started to drift off into darkness, I was /so tired/. Then nothing but black. After an indeterminate amount of time, I remember slowly gaining consciousness and opening my eyes to look around me. The couch was switched back, and my whole entire body felt so weak. The general feeling of my universe felt...bleaker. My family came in and rejoiced, they had said that I was sleeping for more than three days and that I had finally woken up. Now that I think about it, I wonder why they didn't take me into a hospital? What was I sick with, and could it have killed me and I had to jump? How was I able to use the bathroom? Honestly, I need to contact my family and ask them for more details. But I can't help but feel, maybe I HAD died and had gone to a different plane of existence.\n\nEdit: update, I talked to my parents and my mom said she didn't remember a whole lot, but she had stated a lot of the information I already knew to be true. She directed me to my dad, who agreed (he's a huge skeptic so when I told him why I was asking he got a little defensive with the answers) but he mentioned something about a mysterious bladder infection, and that they HAD taken me to the hospital (I asked my mom this, she denied it). So my father is kind of being all defensive and trying to debunk it, and my mother totally agrees with me and agrees that it may have been a jump. For some reason I'm feeling the whole \"Mandela\" effect thing going on, but I still can't be sure. I'll have to ask my siblings next. ",

In this park we have playgrounds that children can play in and walking lanes for old ladies to burn some fat. My memory takes place in the playground where my cousin who is the same age as I am and I were playing. We were sliding and climbing on the curvy slide and talking about some other memory of us. I also remember another child coming behind us when we decided to climb one more time to slide again. When we were halfway through the slide, my mind just went off like what would happen in movies where they show a flashback. It was like dreaming but after a couple minutes in my flashback i came back to myself being at the end or the slide with my cousin in front of me. The other kid wasn't even near us which made me realise that it only a few seconds have passed. When i asked my cousin if he saw it too, he said yes like he was creeped out. I think a glitch happened during those seconds that affected both of us.",

        "text": "I read here, the other glitch subreddit,  dimensional jumping,  law of attraction all this stuff. I have recently read a lot about precognition, and don't know if it is really \"predicting the future\", or CAUSING the future with our thoughts etc.  But I am reminded of early memories when these things just happened all the time,  and just seemed normal.  I thought nothing of them.  Just like \"well of course that happened\". Now that I am a somewhat jaded and older,  these things hardly ever happen,  and when they do,  they seem like \"What dude!  WTH! \" like a big deal.  I suspect that these things are actually NATURAL, but through conditioning,  we go further and further away from it. \n\nI remember clearly my first prayer.  My mom took me to church and I prayed for the toy of \"Castle Greyskull\" from the cartoon He-man. I even remember clearly saying to myself \"Ok, there is my first prayer\". Very shortly afterwards,  my grandma and mom bought me the toy. No I did not tell them and no I wasn't praying out loud.  They just bought it and it was a big thing,  like two feet tall the box.  Would you choose something that big to carry home?  They said to me \"Wow!  See?  You have to be a good boy from now on to deserve this! \" but in my mind I said \"No I don't,  I prayed for it,  it's natural that I get it\". Back then I was probably like four years old and this was like in the eighties or something and it wasn't until decades later in my early thirties that I read such concepts in law of attraction books etc. \n\nEven into my teen years,  I remember I would subscribe to a magazine (delivered in the mail monthly,  there was no e-magazines)  back then.  I would know on the way home that it was there in the mail,  and it didn't arrive all on the same day each month either,  around the first week but always on the day,  I just knew.  I would also think of a friend I hadn't seen in a long time and he suddenly appeared minutes later etc. \n\nThis once I saw on tv my sports idols we're in town and I wanted to go see them.  They had come to do sports but took part in a TV show thing sort of like your current SNL and stuff like that which I saw. I had no idea where to go see them and the just went out to any old unrelated ticket booth and asked \"where can I see them? \" (I know,  I was a kid).  The ticket person thought I was nuts, so I left.  As I was walking away,  a lady tapped me on the shoulder and said \"Are the people you want to see part of XYZsomethingsomething? \" . I said \"I don't know.\" (Nowadays I would probably say \"I have no idea\", not sure why but I felt that was relevant.) She said \"Well,  if they are part of XYZsomethingsomething then you should be go buy tickets at suchandsuch .\" I said OK and went to such and such,  not knowing what on earth XYZsomethingsomething was at all,  and got tickets to see my them idols.  Nowadays I think about it,  it seems like WHOOA THE MAGICK but at the time it was just like \"of course\". \n\nI wonder what happened to me,  and I want to be like I was. Even if not THAT,  the sense of wonder I had,  I miss.  Walking down the road looking at clouds,  \"This one looks like a dinosaur this one a dog! \". Now,   I walk the same road (my parents still live there)  and my head is just somewhere complaining about this worried about that.  I visited recently the place where I randomly went to try to get tickets.  The place has changed,  a new restaurant here, \nno more pay phones, but not that much really.  The floor and wall tiles are still the same. Layout very similar.  The church I first prayed at I have been back several times , once for my grandmas funeral (the other grandma not the one who bought the toy,  she's still around).  It looks pretty much the same.  My mom named me after the Saint in that chruch's name by the way,  cuz that's where she prayed for a child.\nSurprising because it's been like thirty something years,  and every other place else is almost unrecognizable.  What made these places stay the same but other places,  and ME change so much?",

Please don't dissect what I'm about to say as it is a general stoner idea and not a thesis on quantum mechanics..\n\nI agree with the notion that we live in a multiverse where infinite dimensions exist parallel to each other, which are organized as parallel, yet slightly different, timelines... infinitely. I believe that our awareness/consciousness determines which dimension we reside in. I believe that our dreams are the result of our consciousness tapping into alternate dimensions, which can explain why we experience phenomenons like deja vu. Again, I am not making myself out to be some kind of Einstein, I just think about this stuff a lot without any scientific research to go along with it. \n\nANYWAY,\n\nSo we were sitting at the hotel room, watching the game. I had a balloon of NO2 in my hand and put it to my mouth. As I begin inhaling the gas, my friend says \"Let's countdown to 8:08!\" (a number relating to a popular 808 bass drum often found in electronic music). As the game timer approached the number, my reality became fuzzy, I became light headed, and entered a state of euphoria. Under such circumstances, I had no interest in this countdown, and completely tuned out from it. \n\nI then regained focus on reality, at which point my other friend said to me, knowing that I obsess over this subreddit, \"Hey ___ that was like a glitch in t he matrix!\". I then asked her what she meant by that...\n\nShe said \"we were counting down to 8:08, and the timer skipped it!\" \n\nThe timer went \"8:10, 8:09 ... 8:07, 8:06...\" \n\nIt is totally possible that this was just a huge coincidence, but the timing of it leads me to speculate the POSSIBILITY that my  consciousness shifted dimensions during this second, causing me to lose a second. \n\nIf anyone can find a clip of the game from Saturday night, I think it must have been the 1st period of the game. Not sure what network, but we were watching in Atlantic City, NJ. \n\nLet me know what you all think!",

We were sat chatting away, and I said look up and we both leaned back on the bench staring up at these increidble a stars, never seen them that big &amp; bright before and we stared for about 10 minutes. Absolute shock how beautiful they looked. We went back to chatting. A few moments later we looked back up. And no huge bright stars, no clouds. Only 3 ring tiny mini stars. Stars don't move. We froze and were aghast by what was happening. Honestly petrifying, we then got her stuff, went to look back up again and they were all there big and bright. There were No clouds and even if there were,we would have noticed the clouds and also they wouldn't have covered up the entire nights sky, this honestly happened, and we are still so confused, we hope someone can give up a logical explanation, as we don't know what happened. The stars comepleteley disappeared and I haven't focused all day thinking about it ",

I figured I should try to make my first post somewhat benign...\nSo, My brother is 4 years younger than me, &amp; A die hard extrovert who ALWAYS has to be the center of attention, &amp; We don't exactly get along... (All or none of which may or may not be important to this at ALL...)\nAnyway... Probably a few months or so ago by now, my brother is randomly posting memories of [HIS beloved/MY detested] childhood hometown... and he posts matter of factly about \"how much fun he always used to have\" at the old Tastee Freez where the Pizza Hut is now...\nUMM...\nFirst &amp; Foremost, I have exactly ZERO memories of ANY Tastee Freez EVER being there...\nALSO, I KNOW for an ABSOLUTE FACT that the Pizza Hut was up and running when I was in Jr. High, because I CLEARLY remember how old I was; putting quarters in the jukebox; and the songs that were in the jukebox...\nSO... I would have been 12 years old in 7th grade, my brother would have been 8 years old - Even if it ONLY took a year to tear down the Tastee Freez/build the Pizza Hut, my brother would have been 7 at the time the so called Tastee Freez would have last existed (and probably even YOUNGER than that in actual reality...)\nUmm... How many 7 year olds (And MUCH MORE LIKELY 5 or 6 year olds) would have \"fond\" memories of a Tastee Freez... - Especially when their sibling who is 4 years OLDER has absolutely NO memory WHATSOEVER of it EVER existing... O_O\nBecause we just don't get along for a variety of reasons, there is NO option of just asking him if he was just trying to yank my chain - especially since he posted it to FB in general and had NO clue that I would ever even read it since I delete &amp; reactivate my FB at will w/out warning...\nThe weird thing is that, even though everybody &amp; their brother \"liked\" his post, NOBODY who commented EVER specifically said a WORD about THEIR \"memories\" of Tastee Freez, they just said stuff like \"Good old [HIS beloved/MY detested] childhood hometown.\", \"Gotta love [HIS beloved/MY detested] childhood hometown.\", etc.\nAnother weird thing is that I randomly casually asked my mom about it, who SHOULD have seen the post because FB &amp; email &amp; occasional Google searches are ALL that she does online, acted like she'd never seen the post before, &amp; was like, \"That was a LONG TIME AGO. How should I remember whether or not a Tastee Freez ever existed in [HIS beloved/MY detested] childhood hometown?!?!?\".\nI would have probably just let it all go if everybody else who had seen or been told about the post had immediately agreed/remembered that there had once been a Tastee Freez there... BUT... Everybody was nothing but VAGUE about the whole thing... And now I'm nothing but SUSPICIOUS...\nO_O",

It's midnight and no one is cooking anything.\n\nAll of the sudden my dad who is away for work right now messages me (he never messages just to talk and if anything never on the Facebook he never uses)  he tells me hi and I start to have tears in my eyes which I have no clue why it's really bizarre as this is not a normal response to my dad telling me hi. After I say hi back he says \"I feel like I'm in the twilight zone and I'll never come back home\" which is REALLY unlike him because he's never one to talk about feelings and things like that. He ended up just saying the trip was long and they keep moving around.\n\nHe then proceeds to ask me how I'm doing which is also weird and we talked for about three minutes as he told me he was alone at a bar and looked like a looser. (Which again is really unlike him because that's not the type of person he is and nor would he message me just to tell me that.) I\nJoke around with him and made him laugh and then after the three minutes he decided to just cut off and say nice talking to you and goodbye.\n\nAll whilst this is happening I keep smelling cinnamon for the most part, vanilla and later a hint of lemon. It's weird because it reeks these smells and suddenly it doesn't and then it comes back. I have no clue what is going on nor why I'm so emotional and worried right now. I have a really strange and partially scary feeling in my gut and the smells have been going on and off for an hour now.\nI tried googling but couldn't find anything besides spiritual websites or things saying phantosmia, I just want to say I never experienced this before and I'm just all out confused and would appreciate anyone's guess as to why all this is suddenly happening and why I keep smelling these smells and getting really emotional about it.\nThanks!",

        "text": "My wife manages a grocery store it was originally 3 adjoining buildings that were gutted and made into one large building: approximate age 75-80 years.\nMy wife has never mentioned any paranormal occurrences at the store but my oldest daughter whom works there after school and weekends has. \nThe store is run by students from 4:30 pm till 8pm on weekdays and 8am till5 on weekends and this is when things occur. My daughter states that in the evenings when there are no customers in the store they can hear the distinct sound of the  dairy cooler's doors being opened and slammed shut. These coolers are in the back corner of the store and are not visible from the tills. Surveillance footage has been checked but the doors are never seen opening. This occurrence  is regular enough the kids just ignore it.\nThis is where the story gets interesting, apparently on Saturday a woman lost her wallet in the store and the kids were told to be on the lookout for it, the wallet wasn't located. \nThe store is very slow Sunday mornings as  most of the town is in church or nursing a hangover as was this day. My daughter and another girl were walking the aisles  facing shelves when my daughter makes her way to  her till and there is a women's wallet on the grocery belt. She asks the other girl where she found the wallet and she states she has never seen it before and she did not put it on the counter.\nMy daughter phones my wife and tells her they have a ladies wallet that \"appeared\" at one of the tills. My wife says that obviously a customer brought it in, my daughter mentions that  no one had come in the store.\nMy wife asks my daughter to open the wallet and find some id so the owner can be contacted, my daughter complies but oddly the wallet has nothing in it but a drivers license. No money, no business cards, no change, absolutely nothing but a drivers license. My daughter does not recognize the name or the picture on the license which makes sense as the address on it is for a town 60 miles to the northeast. \nMy wife tells my daughter to put it in the safe in the office and on Monday she will try and track this lady down.  My daughter does so and goes back to the till to hang out with the other girl when  a  customer comes in and exuberantly exclaims that she heard her wallet was found.\nMy daughter and the other girl look at each other and do the WTF ! How could she know? Nobody knew who she was so nobody could of contacted her, especially  10 min after the wallet  appeared and  it would take her an  hour and 20 min to drive to the store.\n My daughter asked her her name, it was the name she read on the licence, she retrieved the wallet from the safe, the lady thanked the girls for being so honest, opened up the wallet and gave the girls each 20$.  \nThis is the same wallet that had been devoid of anything either than a drivers license, especially currency  10 min before.\n\nI did ask my daughter why they didn't ask the lady how she heard her wallet was found and her answer was that they were so stunned by the whole thing the thought didn't enter their minds  at the time. It really bothers my daughter now.\n\nThere is surveillance of the grocery belt being bare then in the next frame a wallet is on it,  my daughter  finding it, phoning my wife, walking to the office to place wallet in the safe , the lady showing up and claiming her wallet and exiting the store.",

        "text": "At my work will still use the fairly antiquated time clock that prints the time of your punch on your time card.  Each time card has a small label at the top with the employees name and the date from Monday of that week.  On Monday's, the time cards are just sitting in a pile in front of the microwaves which are right next to the time clock.\n\nToday I came in and my time card happened to be basically right on top.  Great.  A small victory for the day.  As I picked up my time card I noticed the card directly below mine had my exact same name on it.  I remarked this to the people on the room and just thought it was a funny mistake by the girl that sets the cards up.\n\nI double checked the card while I was talking that it was the same date and not one from last week or next week or something where the girl that sets the cards up would've accidentally made a duplicate.  I picked up the duplicate time card and actually held it next to my first time card to compare the two and they were spot on.  I set it down while still talking about it (this whole ordeal took about 10 seconds total) and almost immediately picked it back up to show the girl I was talking to.  As I reached for it, it wasn't there anymore.  The card was, but now the name has changed to another girl's name that I work with.\n\nI sifted through the pile looking for the duplicate card to no avail.  Left me with a weird feeling all day.  I had the two cards in my hands, next to each other, comparing the two.  I know it wasn't just a lazy brain type of issue.  I made and broke eye contact with each card a few times before I set it down.\n\nOk that's all thanks for listening.",

Bat just disappeared, and this was again a very large mill, with parts of it that had the lights off because they didn't run some of the machines except in the morning. Bat could have gone or been anywhere. I forgot about it, until about 4 or 5 hours later. \n\nI had to sew in a new roll of cloth to the one that was preparing to run out (the one that is being fed into the machine), I'm bored out of my mind, and I suddenly think about that bat. \n\nBAM. The bugger lands/flops directly onto the new roll of cloth that I'm sewing in. \nFreaked me out and I have no explanation for the timing of me thinking about that bat and its sudden guest appearance. \n",

He goes into the backyard and I follow, the path had a hedge anyway when I get to the backyard, it was suddenly night. Being three I didn't think much of it, I looked up at the sky and see a crescent moon and shooting stars. I look under the car and see the Cat but I couldn't get to it. I gave up and went back . There was this kid who asks \"where did you go?\" I say \"A cat\" and point to the back yard. I go to my grandpa and say \"it's night in the back yard\" my grandpa shrugs it off, then I go inside and play, my grandfathers cat was inside. That was the end, although later that day at night. We watched a meteor shower I didn't realize it until now but I remember thinking there were shooting stars. The night was a crescent moon,  my memory could be mixed up but I remember it clearly this way I also could've been dreaming. What do you think?",
