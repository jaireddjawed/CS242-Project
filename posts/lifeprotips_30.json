They all walked regularly.\n\nWalking is great for your body. If you’re struggling to exercise, it’s a starting point. It’s great for your mind because you have time and space to think. If you walk outside during the day you also get light exposure and vitamin D.\n\nSo the next time you can’t be bothered picking which show to watch. Or you’re stuck on that assignment. Or you can’t bring yourself to get to the gym. Or you had an argument with a loved one. Or you’re feeling generally lousy about life…\n\nGo for a walk!",

        "text": "I work part-time in an independent bookshop on the high street that can get pretty quiet in between paying customers (for obvious brick and mortar reasons). Most visitors order to collect or we research books on their behalf, and our shop floor is effectively a cupboard library of greatest hits for the impulse buyer. \n\nThere's not a lot of room in there, and I'm kind of trapped behind a counter one day a week by myself with a laptop for company. It's the *perfect* job on paper. But it does tend to invite loiterers...\n\nTypically, these are people that mean well. It's a revolving door of regular folks that simply enjoy my company (what a curse it is to be this liked!) – and sometimes the lonely or elderly in need of company – and I really want to emphasise this bit: **It is nice to see them and lend an ear to those that really need it from time to time**. But these frequent visits are *never* short, they are *rarely* there to buy books, and are *often* in the (physical) way of those that are.\n\nI recognise I'm not always assertive enough with my so-called professionalism (I'm a proven people pleaser) and rely a lot on welcome interruptions to get rid of them. But the postman, another loiterer walking in, or a small queue of waiting customers aren't always enough of a hint for some. Too many continue to *keep talking AT me*. And some appear frustrated at being interrupted by the very reason I'm there! I'm trying to keep the lights on, bruv. :-(\n\nThis list of repeat offenders keeps growing longer by the week too, and I'm worried I'm just going to snap at someone that doesn't realise there's even a problem? Or quit.\n\nPlease help – or make yourself available as a deterrent on Thursdays!\n\n**TL;DR: How do you politely let someone know (in a semi-professional or social setting) they are overstaying their welcome?**",

But no, if you are adding your thoughts/providing unsolicited information even with the sole intent of welfare, your own friends will grow sick of you because those people are very rare who wake up every day with a goal of learning or otherwise have a tendency of gaining knowledge from wherever they can. I can bet you don't have all of your friends like the ones I have talked about above.\n\nOthers feel inferior in your proximity, not being able to share knowledge like you - basic human nature. So no matter if they are your friends or family or your lover, don't start anywhere or everywhere unless you're specifically requested/asked to do so.  \n\nSo to save good relations with your friends and family by being \"one of them\". They will always know you know much more than them, but when you're quiet, they will just appreciate it and will never feel inferior, leading to no enticement.\n\nTLDR; be a need but don't show it off.",
